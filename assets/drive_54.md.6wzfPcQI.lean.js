Westhay Moor is also notified as part of the Somerset Levels and Moors Special Protection Area under the EU Birds Directive and as a Ramsar Site, and a National Nature Reserve. The low-lying swampy area of Westhay Moor has had peat laid down over older rocks for the last 10,000 years. The Neolithic people lived on the areas of slightly higher ground but exploited the reed beds for materials and built wooden trackways to cross the raised bog. Peat extraction on the Somerset Levels has occurred since the area was first drained by the Romans. Measures to improve the drainage were carried out in the Middle Ages largely by Glastonbury Abbey. In the 17th and 18th centuries further drainage work was undertaken including digging a series of rhynes, or ditches and larger drainage canals. Peat extraction peaked in the 1960s but has since declined. The geology of the moor and prolonged peat extraction has provided a unique environment which provides a habitat for a range of flora and fauna. Much of the nature reserve managed by the Somerset Wildlife Trust is based around abandoned peatworkings which have now become flooded. It is particularly noted for the millions of starlings which roost at the site in winter. Location Peat Bog at Westhay Although underlain by much older Triassic age formations that protrude to form what would once have been islands‚Äîsuch as Athelney, Brent Knoll, Burrow Mump and Glastonbury Tor, which is composed of Blue Lias, the lowland landscape was formed only during the last 10,000 years, following the end of the last ice age. As the sea level changed following the Pliocene era, vegetation was laid down which was later converted into peat. The peak of the peat formation took place in swamp conditions around 6,000 years ago, although in some areas it continued into medieval times. Westhay Moor forms part of the Somerset Levels and Moors which is important for its grazing and ditch system, and is crossed by the River Brue and Galton's Canal. Over much of the moor, the water table is high throughout the year with extensive winter flooding occurring regularly. The level of the water tables can be artificially lowered during active working of the peat excavations, but for much of the year these are often filled with water. History The River Brue at Westhay Westhay Moor originally lay at the centre of the most northerly of the two lowland raised bogs that formed in the lower Brue Valley. They reached their greatest extent at the end of the Iron Age. The Neolithic people exploited the reedswamps for their natural resources and started to construct wooden trackways such as the Sweet and Post Tracks. The Sweet Track, named after the peat digger who discovered it in 1970 and dating from the 3800s BCE, is the world's oldest timber trackway, once thought to be the world's oldest engineered roadway. The track was built between what was in the early 4th millennium BCE an island at Westhay and a ridge of high ground at Shapwick, close to the River Brue. The remains of similar tracks have been uncovered nearby, connecting settlements on the peat bog including the Honeygore, Abbotts Way, Bells, Bakers, Westhay and Nidons trackways. The archaeology, history and geology of the Somerset Levels was displayed at the Peat Moors Centre until its closure in 2009. The centre also included reconstructions of some of the archaeological discoveries, including a number of Iron Age round houses from Glastonbury Lake Village, and the Sweet Track. The eastern part of the Moor was covered by Meare Pool which was formed by water ponding-up behind the raised peat bogs between the Wedmore and the Polden Hills, and coring has shown that it is filled with at least of detritus mud, mainly dating from the Subatlantic climatic period (1st millennium BC). In prehistoric times there were two Meare Lake Villages situated within the lake, occupied at different times between 300 BCE and 100 CE, similar to the nearby Glastonbury Lake Village. Early drainage work was carried out in the later years of the 12th century, with the responsibility for maintaining all the watercourses between Glastonbury and the sea being placed on named individuals among whom were Ralph de Sancta Barbara of Brentmarsh. Drainage of the surrounding area by monks of Glastonbury Abbey had reduced the size of the lake to at the time of the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Meare Pool had disappeared from maps by 1749. The Meare Pool originally collected the waters of the rivers Brue and Sheppey, and discharged in a northerly direction into the Lower River Axe. In the later years of the 12th century the Abbey diverted the Brue to flow westwards, perhaps largely through natural channels, from Meare Pool to join the river Parrett. The artificial North Drain crossing the moor In the early 17th century plans were made to drain and enclose much of Sedgemoor. Further reclamation was carried out in stages between about 1620 and 1740, with the \\"new Cutts\\" (or Decoy Rhyne) being built about 1660. The rivers Sheppey and Hartlake were canalised into the River James Wear and Division Rhyne sometime in the late 1730s. In 1795, John Billingsley advocated enclosure and the digging of rhynes (a local name for drainage channels, pronounced \\"reens\\" in the east and rhyne to the west) between plots, and wrote in his Agriculture of the County of Somerset that had been enclosed in the last 20 years in Wedmore and Meare, at Nyland, at Blackford, at Mark, in Shapwick, and at Westhay. In the 1810s Samuel Galton, Jr. showed that bogs could be drained and dressed with clay and other soil, and built Galton's Canal. The character of the soil was also changed by the spreading of clay and silt from the digging of King's Sedgemoor Drain. Galton's Canal was a canal with one lock, connecting the River Brue to the North Drain. It was operational by 1822, and ceased to be used after the 1850s. The land is drained by a series of rhynes, or ditches with water levels (and hence the level of the water table) being controlled by a system of sluice gates and pumps. The water resource management operations are managed by the Somerset internal drainage board. In the early 18th century several duck decoys were built on the moor. These consisted of a pool of water leading from which are from one to eight curving, tapering ditches. Over each ditch is a series of hoops, initially made from wood, later from iron, which diminish in size as the ditch tapers. The hoops are covered in netting. The combination of ditch and net-covered hoops is known as a pipe. =Peat extraction= Peat gatherers at Westhay in 1905. Large areas of peat were laid down on the Somerset Levels, particularly in the River Brue Valley, during the Quaternary period after the ice sheets melted. Peat extraction on the Somerset Levels has occurred since the area was first drained by the Romans. The raised bogs were extensively dug for peat for use as fuel up until the end of World War II after which the primary market was for horticulture. Large parts of Westhay Moor have now been dug back to the underlying clay exposing estuarine deposits dating from about 6000 BP before isolation from the sea and peat formation began. The introduction of plastic packaging in the 1950s allowed the peat to be packed without rotting, which led to the industrialisation of peat extraction during the 1960s as a major market in horticultural peat was developed. However, the resultant reduction in water levels that resulted put local ecosystems at risk; peat wastage in pasture fields was occurring at rates of over 100 years. In 1970 the Somerset Wildlife Trust bought the first part of the last of acid raised bog vegetation left on the Somerset Moors undamaged by peat digging or agriculture. Since then SWT have bought or been given of former peatworkings. These were sculpted and restored to wetland as the experimental area for the Avalon Marshes. This was the term given in the late 1980s to describe the wetland restored from peat workings in the Brue Valley. The wetland on the clay is dominated by Phragmites reed, catstail and open water. The wetland restoration has been a great success and was declared a National Nature Reserve in 1995. Peat working is now beginning to draw to a close on Westhay Moor and the majority of the remaining peatworkings are now being restored to wetland as they are completed. In 2014 two land owners unsuccessfully appealed against changes in planning permission which removed their rights to dig peat from Westhay Moor. Ecology Flooded peat workings at the Westhay Moor National Nature Reserve. Westhay Moor supports a nationally outstanding community of terrestrial and aquatic invertebrates. At least 28 nationally notable invertebrate species also occur on the moor. The meadows, ditches, abandoned peat workings and hedgerows provide suitable breeding habitats for a diverse and nationally important breeding bird community. It is part of the Brue Valley Living Landscape conservation project. The project commenced in January 2009 and aims to restore, recreate and reconnect habitats; joining together protected areas into a network to enable plant and animal movement. It aims to ensure that wildlife is enhanced and capable of sustaining itself in the face of climate change while guaranteeing farmers and other landowners can continue to use their land profitably. It is one of an increasing number of landscape scale conservation projects in the UK. Part of the moor has been designated as a nature reserve, covering , which is managed by the Somerset Wildlife Trust. In addition to open water and reedbeds, it contains a fragment of acid mire, the largest to have survived in the south west of England. The reserve provides habitat for many varieties of birds, which includes millions of starlings between November and January, along with bittern and migrating ospreys. Otters and banded demoiselles are among other species which have made their home on the moor. A large bird hide, reached via a raised boardwalk, has been erected. Westhay Moor is also notified as part of the Somerset Levels and Moors Special Protection Area under the EU Birds Directive and as a Ramsar Site, and a National Nature Reserve.

Situated around 7 miles to the south-west of Cambridge, it lies on the old coaching road between London and Cambridge. Its population in 2001 was 401, falling to 378 at the 2011 Census. History The history of Newton has long been tied to that of neighbouring Hauxton; they were ruled by a single manor, were a single civil parish until the 16th century and until 1930 formed a single ecclesiastical parish. There were disputes over the parish boundaries with Harston and Little Shelford until they were finally settled in 1800, when the parish of Newton was set at 402 hectares. In 970 the land around Newton and Hauxton was passed to King Edgar who offered them to Bishop Aethelwold for the new Abbey at Ely. However, Edgar died before the lands were transferred and the lands were subject to a series of disputes until they were purchased for the Abbey. At the time of the Domesday Book the lands in modern Newton fell under the manor at Hauxton and both villages remained the property of Ely Abbey until the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1539. Since then the manor has been owned by the Hurrell family. The village of Newton itself built up around the intersection of the five roads from Harston, Hauxton, Whittlesford, Thriplow and Foxton. It has always been a small village, and in 1801 was home to only 114 people. In 1746 much of the village was destroyed by a fire. The village's economy has always been dominated by farming. There are 31 listed buildings and monuments in the village. Church Church of St Margaret There has been a small church in the village for at least a thousand years and the present church had long been in use as a chapel when it was finally consecrated in 1346. The church was dedicated to St James until the 18th century when it was dedicated to Saint Margaret. The oldest parts of the present building date from the early 13th century, including its octagonal font. The church was substantially restored in 1851. Village life The Queen's Head The village is home to the Queen's Head public house, which has been open since at least 1729. The pub is one of very few to have appeared in every edition of CAMRA's Good Beer Guide since it started in the 1970s. Its sign depicts Anne of Cleves. The village no longer has a post office as it was converted to a house in 2007.

Design and construction In 1938, the Australian Commonwealth Naval Board (ACNB) identified the need for a general purpose 'local defence vessel' capable of both anti-submarine and mine-warfare duties, while easy to construct and operate.Stevens, The Australian Corvettes, p. 1Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, p. 103. The vessel was initially envisaged as having a displacement of approximately 500 tons, a speed of at least , and a range of Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, pp. 103‚Äì104. The opportunity to build a prototype in the place of a cancelled Bar-class boom defence vessel saw the proposed design increased to a 680-ton vessel, with a top speed of , and a range of , armed with a 4-inch gun, equipped with asdic, and able to be fitted with either depth charges or minesweeping equipment depending on the planned operations: although closer in size to a sloop than a local defence vessel, the resulting increased capabilities were accepted due to advantages over British-designed mine warfare and anti-submarine vessels.Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, pp. 103‚Äì105. Construction of the prototype did not go ahead, but the plans were retained.Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, p. 104. The need for locally built 'all-rounder' vessels at the start of World War II saw the \\"Australian Minesweepers\\" (designated as such to hide their anti-submarine capability, but popularly referred to as \\"corvettes\\") approved in September 1939, with 60 constructed during the course of the war: 36 (including Parkes) ordered by the RAN, 20 ordered by the British Admiralty but manned and commissioned as RAN vessels, and 4 for the Royal Indian Navy.Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, pp. 105, 148.Donohue, From Empire Defence to the Long Haul, p. 29.Stevens et al., The Royal Australian Navy, p. 108. Parkes was laid down by Evans Deakin and Company at Brisbane on 16 March 1943. She was launched on 30 October 1943 by Mrs Brown, wife of the President of the Senate, and commissioned into the RAN on 25 May 1944.

Construction began in 1928 and was complete in 1930 as the corporate headquarters of the IG Farben conglomerate, then the world's largest chemical company and the world's fourth-largest company overall. The building's original design in the modernist New Objectivity style was the subject of a competition which was eventually won by the architect Hans Poelzig. On its completion, the complex was the largest office building in Europe and remained so until the 1950s. The IG Farben Building's six square wings retain a modern, spare elegance, despite its mammoth size. It is also notable for its paternoster elevators. The building was the headquarters for production administration of dyes, pharmaceutical drugs, magnesium, lubricating oil, explosives, and methanol, and for research projects relating to the development of synthetic oil and rubber during World War II. Notably IG Farben scientists discovered the first antibiotic, fundamentally reformed medical research and \\"opened a new era in medicine.\\"Thomas Hager, The Demon under the Microscope, Harmony Books, 2006, After World War II, the IG Farben Building served as the headquarters for the Supreme Allied Command and from 1949 to 1952 the High Commissioner for Germany (HICOG). Notably Dwight D. Eisenhower had his office in the building. It became the principal location for implementing the Marshall Plan, which supported the post-war reconstruction of Europe. The 1948 Frankfurt Documents, which led to the creation of a West German state allied with the western powers, were signed in the building. The IG Farben Building served as the headquarters for the US Army's V Corps and the Northern Area Command (NACOM) until 1995. It was also the headquarters of the CIA in Germany. During the early Cold War, it was referred to by US authorities as the Headquarters Building, United States Army Europe (USAREUR); the US Army renamed the building the General Creighton W. Abrams Building in 1975. It was informally referred to as \\"The Pentagon of Europe.\\" In 1995, the US Army transferred the IG Farben Building to the German government, and it was purchased by the state of Hesse on behalf of the University of Frankfurt. Renamed the Poelzig Building in honour of its architect, the building underwent a restoration and was opened as part of the university in 2001. It is the central building of the West End Campus of the university, which also includes over a dozen other buildings built after 2001. History =The site= The IG Farben Building was developed on land known as the Gr√ºneburggel√§nde. In 1837, the property belonged to the Rothschild family. It was part of the \\"Affensteiner Feld\\", an area in the north of today's Frankfurt Westend District. The name Affenstein derives from an ancient Christian memorial that once stood here on the road outside Frankfurt. It was known as the \\"Avestein\\" as in Ave Maria but in the local Frankfurt dialect it was called the \\"Affe Stein\\". In 1864, the city's psychiatric hospital was erected on the site. Here, Dr Heinrich Hoffman hired Alois Alzheimer to work in the hospital, where they both explored progressive methods of treating the mentally ill. The Gr√ºneburgpark was established in 1880 on the larger western part of the site. =Early history= IG Farben acquired the property in 1927 to establish its headquarters there. In the 1920s, IG Farben (full German name Interessengemeinschaft Farbenindustrie Aktiengesellschaft or 'Dye Industry Interest Group Limited') was the world's largest drug, chemical and dye conglomerate. Frankfurt was chosen because of its centrality and its accessibility by air and land. In August 1928, Professor Hans Poelzig won a limited competition to design the building, among five selected architects, notably beating Ernst May, the then Head of Urban Design for Frankfurt. Work on the foundations began in late 1928, and in mid-1929 construction started on the steel frame. The building was completed in 1930 after only 24 months, by employing rapid-setting concrete, new construction materials and a round-the-clock workforce. Later in 1930, the Frankfurt director of horticulture Max Bromme and the artists' group Bornimer Kreis developed designs for the 14 hectares of parkland that surrounded the building. The grounds, and the complex as a whole, were completed in 1931 at a total cost of 24 million Reichsmark (equivalent to million ‚Ç¨). =1930s and Second World War= Front of the Poelzig Building from the southeast, with its temple-like portico entrance and rotunda After completion, the building was the headquarters of IG Farben for 15 years. IG Farben was an indispensable part of the German industrial base from its establishment in 1925, and the world's largest chemical and pharmaceutical company. Although IG Farben had been reviled on the far right and accused of being an \\"international capitalist Jewish company\\",Ernst B√§umler, Die Rotfabriker ‚Äì Familiengeschichte eines Weltunternehmens (Hoechst), Piper 1988, p. 277 f., Geschichte der Chemie in Frankfurt. the company nonetheless remained a large government contractor under Nazi Party rule. During World War II, the surrounding neighbourhood was devastated, but the building itself was left largely intact (and inhabited by the homeless citizens of a bomb-ravaged Frankfurt). In March 1945, Allied troops occupied the area and the IG Farben Building became the American headquarters of General Dwight D. Eisenhower. Eisenhower's office was where he received many important guests; including General de Gaulle, Field Marshal Montgomery and Marshal Zhukov. It was there that he signed the \\"Proclamation No. 2\\", which determined which parts of the country would be within the American zone. Eisenhower vacated the building in December 1945 but his office was still used for special occasions: the constitution of the state of Hesse was signed there, the West German Ministerpr√§sident received his commission to compile the Grundgesetz (German constitution) and the administration of the Wirtschaftsrat der Bizone (Economic Council of the Bizone) was also located there. =Cold War= View of the IG Farben Building from the Main Tower From 1945 to 1947, the IG Farben Building was the location of the Supreme Headquarters, Allied European Forces, and was the headquarters for the US occupation forces and Military Governor. On May 10, 1947, permanent orders to military personnel prohibited further reference to the building as the \\"IG Farben Building\\", and instead called for it to be referred to as \\"The Headquarters Building, European Command\\". The United States High Commissioner for Germany (HICOG) and his staff occupied the building from 1949 to 1952. After 1952, the building served as the European centre of the American armed forces and the headquarters of the U.S. V Corps. It later became the headquarters for the Northern Area Command until 1994. The IG Farben Building was also the headquarters of the CIA in Germany, which led to its sobriquet 'the Pentagon of Europe'. On April 16, 1975, the US Army renamed the building the General Creighton W. Abrams Building. The renaming did not have full authority in law, because the US was technically leasing the building from the German government and thus was not the rightful owner. On May 11, 1972, three bombs were set off by the West German terrorist group Rote Armee Fraktion (Red Army Faction, i.e., the Baader-Meinhof Group). Two bombs went off in a rotunda in the rear entrance of the IG Farben building, and a third exploded in a smaller building behind the IG Farben building that was serving as the US Military's officer's club. Lt. Col. Paul Bloomquist was killed by the last bomb, and dozens of Americans and Germans were injured. The IG Farben building was attacked again by the same group in 1976 and 1982. Consequently, the publicly accessible adjoining park became part of a restricted military zone which also included the military living quarters and work areas at the rear of the building. =Recent years= Following German reunification, the US government announced plans to fully withdraw its troops from Frankfurt, Germany by 1995, at which time control of the entire site would be restored to the German Federal Government. It was suggested that the building could become the location for the European Central Bank. In 1996, the state of Hesse bought the building and associated land for the University of Frankfurt. The buildings were refurbished at a cost of 50 Million German Mark (about US$26M or 25M ‚Ç¨), by the Copenhagen-based architecture practice Dissing+Weitling and were handed over to the university. The complex now houses the Westend Campus of the university, which includes the departments of Philosophy, History, Theology, Classical Philology, Art and Music, Modern Languages and Linguistics, Cultural and Civilization Studies, the Center for North American Studies and the Fritz-Bauer-Institute. =Renaming controversy= Even in 1995 the association of the building with Nazism had been hard to shake off, despite its outstanding 1920s architecture. Der Spiegel wrote about the \\"Smell of Guilt\\" after its public opening in 1995, but also that the building itself did not deserve the bad reputation.Architektur Geruch von Schuld - [Der Spiegel] 51/1995 Only with the departure of the Americans, the subsequent renovations, and the use of the building by the university has the building's association with the Third Reich in the popular consciousness receded. The university's tenancy of the building sparked a debate regarding the name of the building. Former University President Werner Meissner had started the controversy by proposing to name it the \\"Poelzig-Ensemble\\" (Poelzig-Complex). Members of the university insisted on confronting the building's history by retaining its original name, the \\"IG Farben Building\\". Meissner's successor, Rudolf Steinberg, upheld the decision to retain the name, but he did not enforce a uniform nomenclature within the university's administration. The university's senate finally settled the discussions in July 2014 by keeping the official name \\"I.G.-Farbenhaus\\" (IG Farben Building).https://www.facebook.com/astafrankfurt/posts/826111527428877 By 2004 the university set up a permanent exhibition inside the building, and a memorial plaque, for the slave labourers of IG Farben and those who had perished by Zyklon B gas, was installed on the front of the building. After 10 years of debate the Senate of the University agreed in 2014 to name a place on the new campus's southern end after the former slave labourer Norbert Wollheim.https://www.journal-frankfurt.de/journal_news/Campus-5/Rat-der- UEberlebenden-fuer-Umbenennung-Neuer-Appell-fuer-Wollheim-Platz-21956.html =Future= Behind the IG Farben Building, the state of Hessen intends to build \\"Europe's most modern campus\\" to accommodate the remaining departments of the University's old Bockenheim campus, law, business, social sciences, child development, and the arts. As of 2018, there are several new buildings finished. Construction of the students' union building and of the faculty building for linguistics, cultures, and arts has begun. The last step to complete the new university campus will be the relocation of the main library within the 2020s. Building Plan of the IG Farben Building, showing the six wings (designated Q1‚ÄìQ6 from right to left), the curving central corridor (designated V1‚ÄìV5) and the 'Casino' building to the rear In 1928, IG Farben was the world's fourth-largest company and its largest chemical company. Consequently, the space requirements for the building were for one of the largest office buildings ever constructed. It was designed in the New Objectivity style. IG Farben did not want a specifically 'Bauhaus' styled building‚Äîit wanted: :A symbol, in iron and stone, of German commercial and scientific manpower.Translated from \\"Ein eisernes und steinernes Sinnbild deutscher kaufm√§nnischer und wissenschaftlicher Arbeitskraft\\" Georg von Schnitzler, IG Farben Director, 1930. The 250-metre long and 35-metre tall building has nine floors, but the height of the ground floor varies (4.6‚Äì4.2 m). This variation is reflected in the roof line which looks taller at the wings than the spine. The volume of the building is 280,000 m¬≥, constructed from 4,600 tonnes of steel frame with brick infill and floors constructed of hollow blocks to provide over 55740 m¬≤ of usable office space\\". The fa√ßade is clad with 33,000 m¬≤ Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt Travertine marble, punctuated in bands of windows decreasing in height with each storey. Only at the corners are the glazed strips interrupted for emphasis. The top storey is lit from skylights rather than banded glazing and has a very low ceiling height. It forms a clear building conclusion. In the mid-'50s, this upper storey housed a military affiliate radio station (MARS). Until the 1950s, the building was the largest and most modern office building in Europe. The pool with the Klimsch Sculpture \\"Am Wasser\\" (at the water). The Casino is in the background. The IG Farben Building consists of six wings, connected by a gently curved, central corridor. This arrangement provides all of the offices with sufficient natural light and ventilation. This design approach for large complexes offers an alternative to the \\"hollow rectangle\\" schemes of the time, with their typical inner courtyards. The prototype of this form is the General Motors Building in Detroit (1917‚Äì21) by Albert Kahn. The building presents a very large and weighty fa√ßade to the front, but this effect is reduced by the concave form. The main entrance is at the axial centre of the building, comprising a temple- like portico standing in front of the doors‚Äîa relatively common motif of administration buildings of the time. The entrance arrangement is regarded by some people as slightly pompous: the entrance and lift doors are of bronze, and the ceiling and walls of the porch are clad in bronze plate and copper friezes. The inner lobby has two curved staircases with a sheet aluminum treatment, and marble walls with a zigzag pattern. The axial centre at the rear of the building has a round glazed fa√ßade; here, the view of the buildings at the rear of the site (the \\"casino\\") is maximised by the curved walls that afford vistas to the subsidiary buildings 100 m distant, separated from the main building by parkland and a pool. During the American occupation of the building, this rotunda housed a small kiosk; later, it was used as a conference room. Nowadays, it is called the Dwight D. Eisenhower room and accommodates a caf√©. The paternoster lifts that serve the nine floors are famous, and are popular with the university students. After the recent restoration, the university has pledged to preserve them in perpetuity. Behind the rotunda is an oblong pool with a Nymphenskulptur (German:Nymph sculpture) at the water's edge created by Fritz Klimsch entitled \\"Am Wasser\\". Behind it stands a flat building on a hill with a terrace‚Äîthe casino of IG Farben and the Officers Club of the US Army (\\"The Terrace Club\\"), which now houses a refectory and lecture-rooms. Rumours A number of unconfirmed rumours concern the complex: * Hans Poelzig was not favoured by the Nazi regime and was banned by IG Farben from entering the building after its completion. * General Eisenhower issued orders to preserve the building during the bombardment of Frankfurt, because he intended to use it after the war as his headquarters. It may also have been that the building was saved by its proximity to Gr√ºneburgpark with its prisoner of war camp holding captured American airmen. * Two or three basements were under the Poelzig building, which were sealed and flooded. In fact, the building only has one basement level. * There were rumors about a tunnel connecting the building with Frankfurt's main railway station. \\\\- In fact there was no tunnel to the station, but a service tunnel to connect the dining facility to the main building's heating-system, which was filled up during the 1996‚Äì2001 renovation. * At the reflecting pool behind the building, the \\"Am Wasser\\" sculpture of a naked water nymph was moved during the American occupation. The nymph was moved to the Hoechst chemical company in Frankfurt/Hoechst at the request of Mamie Eisenhower (the general's wife), who deemed it inappropriate for a military installation. The statue has since been returned to its original location. See also * IG Farben Trial * Allied Occupation Zones in Germany References =Notes= =Further reading= *Loewy, Peter & Loewy, Hanno.

Dooley enjoyed a successful playing career at club level with Seir Kieran and is the only Offaly player ever to have won three All-Ireland titles. After a spell as player-manager with Seir Kieran, Dooley worked as manager with Tullamore, Toomevara and Offaly. He managed the Irish Senior International Shinty team for three years against Scotland and has managed the Linster Senior Hurling team for the period 2012 to 2014. Born in Clareen, County Offaly, Dooley was the eldest of a family of five boys and four girl and was born into a family that was steeped in hurling history. His paternal and maternal granduncles and his grandfather played for Offaly in the junior All- Ireland finals of 1915,1923 and 1929. Other members of the famous Dooley family include brothers Billy and Johnny, as well as his son Shane. He married wife Marie in 1985 and as well as eldest son Shane, they have two daughters, Aideen, and Niamh. Joe Dooley has been immortalised in the song ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs Joe Dooley‚Äù Playing career =Club= Dooley played his club hurling with the Seir Kieran club and enjoyed much success in a career that last for a quarter of a century. In 1985 Seir Kieran qualified for their first county championship decider in over thirty years and Dooley was one of the key forwards. He bagged a grand total of 1-4 in the game, however, Kinnitty routed their opponents by 3-18 to 2-8. Two years later Seir Kieran were back in the county final again. Club kingpins St. Rynagh's provided the opposition and a close game developed. Dooley was Seir Kieran's top scorer again with five points, however, the Banagher-based club recorded an 0-11 to 0-9 victory. In 1988 Dooley took over as player-manager of the club. Seir Kieran won the senior club league for the first time and also qualified for a second successive county final beating Kimmitty in the semi-final. St. Rynagh's provided the opposition for the second year in-a-row, however, on this occasion Seir Kieran were the winners and Dooley collected his first county senior championship winners' medal scoring 0-4. Joe, Billy and Johnny scored 2-11 in the final, while his other brother Kieran got man of the match. Seir Kieran went through a drought of success for the majority of the next eight years. After failing to make it two county titles in-a-row in 1989, Dooley's club lost championship deciders to Birr in 1991 and again in 1994. In 1995 Seir Kieran qualified for the club championship decider again after defeating reigning county, provincial and All-Ireland club champions Birr in the semi- final. St Rynagh's provided stiff opposition in the county final, however, Seir Kieran looked to be heading towards their second championship ever. An equalising goal by St. Rynagh's in the second minute of injury time secured a draw and a replay. Seir Kieran won the replay a week later and Dooley secured his second county championship title and was captain of the side. Both Seir Kieran and St. Rynagh's met again in the championship decider of 1996 and, once again, the game was a close affair. Dooley's side were two points in arrears with two minutes to go, however, Seir Kieran battled back to win by 0-13 to 1-8. It was a third county title for Dooley. In 1997 Seir Kieran had the chance to make it three title in-a-row. All was going to plan as Dooley's side qualified for the championship decider with Birr. The game developed into a tight affair, however, Birr pulled away in the last ten minutes to secure a 0-14 to 2-4 victory. A fourth championship decider in succession beckoned for Dooley's side in 1998 with old rivals St. Rynagh's providing the opposition. This game ended in a draw, and the replay saw Dooley pick up a fourth county championship winners' medal following a 1-11 to 0-8 victory. After failing to retain the title in 1999, Seir Kieran were back in the millennium championship decider. Birr easily won the game by 3-21 to 1-9. By 2006 Dooley had retired from the Seir Kieran senior hurling team, however, he lined out for club's junior team in the championship decider that year. St. Rynagh's provided the opposition, however, Seir Kieran claimed the title. =Inter-county= Dooley enjoyed a successful colleges career, winning five Leinster colleges medals, and played in two all-Ireland senior colleges finals with Presentation Brothers College Birr. He joined the Offaly senior hurling panel in April 1982. He quickly became a regular player in the National Hurling League campaigns. Two years later in 1984 Dooley made his senior championship debut, playing against Wexford in the provincial decider. A close game developed, however, the full-time whistle Offaly were the winners by 1-15 to 2-11. A single-point victory gave Dooley his first Leinster winners‚Äô medal. A subsequent 4-15 to 1-10 defeat of Galway in the All-Ireland semi-final with Dooley scoring 2-3 allowed Offaly to advance to the centenary-year All-Ireland final at Semple Stadium in Thurles. It was the first ever meeting of Offaly and Cork in championship history. The game failed to live up to expectations and Cork recorded a relatively easy 3-16 to 1-12 victory. In 1985 Dooley lined out in a second consecutive provincial decider. Laois provided the opposition on that occasion. Offaly won easily by 5-15 to 0-17. The ability to get goals at crucial times gave Dooley a second Leinster medal. A fourteen-point trouncing of Antrim in the All-Ireland semi-final allowed Offaly to advance to the All-Ireland final. Galway were the opponents on that occasion and a tense game ensued. Again it was Offaly‚Äôs goal-scoring ability that proved crucial. Pat Cleary scored the first of the day after twenty-five minutes of play and got his second less than half a minute after the restart. Dooley had a goal disallowed halfway through the second-half while a long Joe Cooney effort, which seemed to cross the goal line, was not given for Galway. P.J. Molloy was Galway‚Äôs goal scorer, however, the day belonged to Offaly. A 2-11 to 1-12 victory gave Dooley his first All-Ireland medal. After losing back-to-back Leinster finals to Kilkenny for the next two years, Offaly won again 1988. A 3-12 to 1-14 defeat of Wexford gave Dooley a third winners' medal in the provincial championship. Offaly's championship campaign was ended in the All- Ireland semi-final when Galway won by seven points. In 1989 Offaly were still the masters of the Leinster championship. Dooley came on as a substitute to collect his fourth provincial winners' medal as his team defeated Kilkenny by 3-15 to 4-9. Offaly's next game was an All-Ireland semi-final meeting with Antrim and, while the Leinster champions were the red-hot favourites, victory went to the Ulster champions on a score line of 4-15 to 1-15. The significance of this victory was not lost on Offaly as the entire team gave the Antrim players a guard of honour and a standing ovation as they left the field. It was the first time that the team had qualified for an All-Ireland final since 1943. Dooley missed the 1990 championship campaign, however, in 1991 he added a National Hurling League medal to his collection. The following years saw Offaly face defeat in the early rounds of the provincial championship. By that stage all three Dooley brothers were playing together on the Offaly senior team. After a few years out of the limelight Offaly bounced back in 1994. That year Dooley added a fifth Leinster winners‚Äô medal to his collection following a 1-18 to 0-14 victory over Wexford. After defeating Galway in the All-Ireland semi-final, Dooley later lined out against Limerick in the All-Ireland final. With five minutes left in the game Limerick were five points ahead and were coasting to victory. It was then that one of the most explosive All-Ireland final finishes of all-time took place. Offaly were awarded a close-in free which Johnny Dooley stepped up to take. Dooley was told by the management team to take a point; however, he lashed the ball into the Limerick net to reduce the deficit. Following the puck-out, Offaly worked the ball upfield and Pat O'Connor struck for a second goal. The Offaly forwards scored another five unanswered points in the time remaining to secure a 3-16 to 2-13 victory. This sensational victory gave Dooley a second All-Ireland winner‚Äôs medal. In 1995 Offaly retained the Leinster title following a 2-16 to 2-5 trouncing of Kilkenny. It was Dooley's sixth and final provincial winners‚Äô medal. Down fell to Offaly in the subsequent All-Ireland semi-final, allowing Offaly to advance to the championship decider and attempt to put back-to-back All-Ireland titles together for the first time ever. It was the first-ever meeting of Offaly and Clare in the history of the championship. The game developed into a close affair with Offaly taking a half-time lead. Four minutes from the end, substitute √âamonn Taaffe first timed a long range free straight into the net to give Clare a one-point lead. After a quick equaliser, Anthony Daly sent over a 65-metre free to give his team the lead again. Jamesie O'Connor pointed soon afterwards and at the full-time whistle Clare were the 1-13 to 2-8 winners. After a couple of seasons in the doldrums, Offaly emerged again in 1998, however, the year was not without controversy. That year Dooley's side reached the Leinster final but lost by five points to Kilkenny. This defeat prompted their manager, Babs Keating, to describe the Offaly hurlers as \\"sheep in a heap\\", and he promptly resigned. It looked as if Offaly's championship hopes were in disarray, however, they overcame Antrim in the All-Ireland quarter-final and qualified to meet Clare in the semi-final. That game ended in a draw 1-13 apiece draw and had to be replayed. The replay, however, was ended early because of a time-keeping error by the referee Jimmy Cooney. Following a protest on the pitch of Croke Park by the Offaly supporters it was decided that Clare and Offaly would meet for a third time. Dooley's side won the third game and qualified to play Kilkenny in the final in a repeat of the provincial decider. On that day Brian Whelahan, despite suffering from flu, started in defence and was later moved to full-forward where he scored 1-6. Offaly reversed the Leinster final defeat by winning the All-Ireland final by six points. Dooley set a record by becoming the first Offaly player to capture a third All-Ireland winners' medal. He was later presented with his sole All- Star award. Two years later in 2000 Dooley's side suffered a heavy defeat to Kilkenny in the Leinster final. As a result of the 'back-door' system in the championship both sides later faced off against each other again in the All- Ireland final. D. J. Carey capitalised on an Offaly mistake after just six minutes to start a goal-fest for 'the Cats'. Carey scored 2-4 in all, sharing his second goal with Henry Shefflin who also scored a goal in the second-half. At the full-time whistle Kilkenny were the champions by 5-15 to 1-14. It was one of the most one-sided finals in decades and marked the end of the great Offaly team of the nineties. In 2001 there was speculation that Dooley would soldier on for another season of inter-county activity. In spite of this he announced his inter-county retirement in March of that year. Management career =Early experience= Even at the height of his playing career Dooley became involved in team management. In 1988 he was only twenty-four years-old when he took over as player-manager at Seir Kieran. It was a successful move as Dooley proved instrumental both on and off the field in helping the club to take their first ever senior county championship title. He steered Seir Kieran to two league titles and a first senior championship win. Just two years after his inter-county career drew to a close, Dooley took charge of the famous Toomevara club in Tipperary. It was a reasonably successful tenure, however, it was a turbulent one nonetheless. In spite of guiding 'Toome' to win the Tipperary Senior League and the semi-finals of the north Tipperary championship, Dooley departed his position as manager just a week before that game as speculation grew that the players were not happy with his training methods. Two years later Dooley was back in club management, this time with his adopted home of Tullamore. He enjoyed success winning the division two league and setting the foundations for their senior championship success in 2009. =Offaly= In October 2007 Dooley was appointed manager of the Offaly senior hurling team. Shortly before taking up this post, Dooley's brother, Johnny, was appointed manager of the Westmeath senior hurling team. Dooley's first championship campaign in 2008 was a tough one. After trouncing Laois by 4-22 to 2-12 in the provincial quarter-final, Offaly qualified to play reigning All-Ireland champions Kilkenny. A 2-24 to 0-12 defeat was Offaly's lot on that occasion, as Dooley's side were banished to the All- Ireland qualifiers and a tough assignment against Limerick. That game defined both teams' seasons as Dooley's underdogs triumphed by 3‚Äì19 to 0-18. Offaly's reward for winning that game was another All-Ireland qualifier against Waterford in Semple Stadium. In spite of giving a good account of themselves, Dooley's side were beaten by a very experienced Waterford outfit; however, there was cause for optimism due to some very good championship performances. In 2009 Dooley's side built on their progress by reaching the division 2 final of the National Hurling League. Fellow Leinstermen Wexford provided the opposition, however, Offaly triumphed by 1-13 to 0-13 and claimed promotion to division 1. The subsequent championship campaign was not a successful one as Wexford exacted their revenge by dumping Offaly out of the provincial championship. The All-Ireland qualifiers route beckoned again, however, Cork trounced Dooley's side and brought their championship campaign to an end. 2010 saw Offaly open their championship campaign with a narrow extra-time defeat of Antrim. Offaly's side were regarded as underdogs for their next game against Galway, however, the men from the 'faithful county' nearly pulled off the shock of the championship. A draw was the result, however, the replay was just as exciting with victory going narrowly to Galway. After defeating Limerick Offaly's interest in the championship was ended by eventual champions Tipperary. Dooley stepped down from his post as Offaly senior hurling manager on 28 June 2011, following Offaly's championship exit to Cork by a narrow margin. Dooley managed the Irish International Hurling/Shinty team to success over Scotland in 2009, 2010 and 2011. He also managed Leinster in the interprovincial hurling competition in 2012, 2013 and 2014, winning the competition in 2012 and 2014.

Based on the novel Uncommon Danger by Eric Ambler and set in politically neutral Turkey, the screenplay was credited to W. R. Burnett, although William Faulkner and Daniel Fuchs\\"Writing for the Movies\\", Daniel Fuchs, 'Commentary magazine', February 1962 also contributed. The movie was directed by Raoul Walsh. The film was designed to capitalize on the runaway success of Casablanca, which had also featured Lorre and Greenstreet. The Russian operative positively portrayed by Brenda Marshall shows an exaggerated degree of cooperation, and the film has a slight pro-Soviet bias akin to Warners' Mission to Moscow from the same year. Walsh called the film \\"a quickie\\". Plot In 1942, Nazi Germany attempts to bring neutral Turkey into the war on its side by staging an assassination attempt on Franz von Papen, its own ambassador to the country. Much to the annoyance of Colonel Robinson (Sydney Greenstreet), von Papen survives and the Russians that his agent provocateur was trying to frame have solid alibis, forcing him to turn to another scheme to inflame Turkey's traditional rivalry with Russia. Meanwhile, American machinery salesman Joe Barton (George Raft) boards the Baghdad-Istanbul Express train at Aleppo and is attracted to another passenger, Ana Remzi (Osa Massen). She is worried about being searched by customs agents once they reach the Turkish border; she asks Joe to hold on to an envelope containing some securities, all that remains of her inheritance. Joe obliges, but when he later examines the envelope, he finds maps of Turkey with writing on them. When they stop in Ankara, he goes to her hotel to return her property, only to find she has been fatally wounded. He hides when someone else approaches the room. He watches unobserved as Soviet spy Nikolai Zaleshoff (Peter Lorre) searches the dead woman's luggage. Then, Joe exits through the window. Leaving the scene, he is seen by Tamara Zaleshoff (Brenda Marshall), Nikolai's sister and partner in espionage. The Turkish police take Joe in for questioning, only it turns out that they are German agents. They take him to their leader, Colonel Robinson. Robinson wants the maps. Joe refuses to cooperate, and is taken away to be interrogated by Mailler (Kurt Katch). Before the Germans get very far, Joe is rescued by Nikolai. When the Zaleshoffs reveal that they are Soviet agents, Joe agrees to fetch them the documents. Unfortunately, he finds his hotel room has been ransacked and the documents stolen. Joe, it turns out, is also a spy (for the United States). When he reports to his boss, McNamara (Willard Robertson), he is assigned an assistant, Hassan (Turhan Bey). The two men head to Istanbul. There, Robinson has bribed a newspaper publisher to print an article claiming that the documents are secret Russian plans for the invasion of Turkey. When Joe barges in by himself, he is quickly taken prisoner. The Zaleshoffs have also been captured. Joe and Tamara get away, but Nikolai is killed during the escape. Joe kidnaps a German embassy official and learns where Robinson has gone. Joe heads to the newspaper. There he forces the Nazi ringleader at gunpoint to burn the maps. Robinson is handed over to the Turkish police and then to his greatly displeased superior. He departs by airplane, knowing he is doomed for his failure. Joe and Tamara head to Cairo for their next assignments. Cast * George Raft as Joe Barton * Brenda Marshall as Tamara Zaleshoff * Sydney Greenstreet as Col.

It was published in the US under the title Background to Danger. Film rights were bought by Warner Bros. The film was going to star Jeffrey Lynn then he was withdrawn and replaced by Ronald Reagan and Jane Wyman. Lew Seiler then Jo Graham was assigned to direct. Philip MacDonald was assigned to write the script. =George Raft= In June 1942, the film became a star vehicle for George Raft. It was Raft's first film for Warners since Manpower. He had turned down a number of movies at the studio including The Maltese Falcon and All Through the Night. Raft insisted on the script being changed so that his character was an undercover American agent instead of an ordinary man.Everett Aaker, The Films of George Raft, McFarland & Company, 2013. p. 104 This was common behavior from Raft at the time. Writer W.R. Burnett, who had also written Scarface said \\"I was always afraid that I'd have to face Eric Ambler after what we did to that. The point of Background to Danger was that this man was a salesman and suddenly things begin to happen to him that he can't understand. And he gets involved in all this espionage. But Raft wouldn't do it unless he was an FBI man. The whole story went out the window... He said he didn't want to be any ribbon salesman. I think he wanted to be on the side of the law for a change.\\" John Collier was brought in to work on the script. Jerry Wald was assigned to produce and Raoul Walsh to direct. =Shooting= Filming started September 1942. In November 1942 Raft would buy out his contract with Warners. Reception The film was a box office success.

Dooley, together with his brothers Joe and Johnny, formed the backbone of the Offaly attack for over a decade. Dooley began his hurling career at club level with Seir Kieran. He broke onto the club's top adult team as an 18-year-old when he lined out as a goalkeeper in the 1987 Offaly Championship. Having earlier won under-16 and minor championship titles, Dooley won Offaly Senior Championship titles in 1988, 1995, 1996 and 1998. At inter-county level, Dooley was part of the successful Offaly minor team that won back-to-back All-Ireland Championships in 1986 and 1987, before later ending up as an All-Ireland Championship runner-up with the Offaly under-21 team in 1989.

A tourist destination, Almagro is designated a Conjunto hist√≥rico, a type of conservation area. Almagro lies within small Paleozoic mountain ranges, with some reserves of shallow creeks, including the Pellejero and de Cuetos. It also lies within a volcanic zone (Cerrro de la Yezosa), which lies upon a quartzite massif. It makes the zone particularly unique, together with that of the zones of Olot and Cabo de Gata, in the sense that it is one of the few important zones of volcanic origin in the Iberian Peninsula. An International Festival of Classical Theater has also been celebrated here annually since 1978. History =Prehistory and Roman era= It is uncertain when humans first settled in the area of Almagro. There may have been a Bronze Age settlement; a theory supported by archaeological findings in the Casas Maestrales (complex of houses associated with the Order of Calatrava) and in spots outside of the town center. During the Roman era, it seems to have been inhabited, according to the scholar Galiano y Ortega, who argued that he saw the remains of an aqueduct, which were discovered during the construction of the present-day Paseo de la Estaci√≥n. Roman coins have been found, as well as a headstone from this era, which can now be seen in the Town Hall; the headstone was discovered near the Roman bridge at Zuqueca, in Gran√°tula. =Visigothic era= Little remains of the Visigothic presence in the area except for some small columns decorated with beveled diamonds; the columns were dispersed by the local population. =Middle Ages= During the 13th century, Almagro declined due to the presence of competing cities in the area, Oretum (Gran√°tula de Calatrava) and Calatrava la Vieja. However, Almagro was chosen by the Order of Calatrava as a place of residence during the same century. Almagro thus benefited from being the center of governance for this order. A local tradition holds that a Master of the Order, Don Gonzalo Y√°nez, gave the town its charter in 1213, confirmed by Ferdinand III of Castile in 1222. In 1273, Alfonso X of Castile convoked the Castilian Cortes in Almagro and in 1285 Master of the Order Ruy P√©rez Ponce worked out an agreement in 1285 over rights concerning the town's ovens, market place, and toll roads. In the fourteenth century, the town had a wall and a parish church, San Bartolom√© el Real, butcher shops, granary, jailhouse, townhall, and a castle absorbed by the buildings owned by the Order of Calatrava. The process of the Reconquista resulted in the gathering at Almagro of forces headed for the frontier. Pedro I of Castile arrested the Master of the Order, Juan N√∫√±ez de Prado, in 1354 at the Casas Maestrales. In 1374, Henry II of Castile allowed the town to organize two fairs, which aided commerce. The General Chapters of the Order of Calatrava (Cap√≠tulos Generales de la Orden de Calatrava) also met in the town, in the chapel of San Benito de los Palacios Maestrales and in the church of Santa Mar√≠a de los Llanos, both of which no longer exist. In the fifteenth century, the office of Master of the Order was incorporated into the Crown of Castile in 1487, but this did not harm the town. The Royal Governor now inhabited the Palaces formerly occupied by the Masters of the Order. In 1493, Cardinal Cisneros ordered the construction of the Franciscan monastery of Santa Mar√≠a de los Llanos, annexed to the church of the same name, but this too has disappeared. Due to the financial woes of Charles I of Spain, the German bankers of the Fugger family became beneficiaries of the mines at Almad√©n and Almagro. They brought with them to the town German administrators such as Wessel, Xedler, etc. Some of these Germans‚Äô manor houses still survive. =Sixteenth and seventeenth centuries= Main square of Almagro The population grew during the 16th and 17th centuries, and the population expanded beyond the town walls, with the suburbs of San Pedro, Santiago, San Ildefonso, San Juan, San Sebasti√°n, and San L√°zaro being established during this time. The Claverian Fernando Fern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba founded the monastery and educational institution of Nuestra Se√±ora del Rosario. The knight commander don Gutierre de Padilla founded the Hospital de la Misericordia and the monastery of Asunci√≥n de Calatrava. The parish church of Madre de Dios, the convent of La Encarnaci√≥n, business offices for the Fuggers, and a large number of manor houses were built during this time. Rebuilt during this time were the church of San Blas, the Main Square (Plaza), and the Town Hall. The crisis affecting Spain during the late 16th and early 17th centuries did not affect construction in Almagro; the Franciscans built during this time the Convent of Santa Catalina. The Augustinians, Jesuits, and Hospitalers established themselves here, and the followers of Juan Francisco Gaona y Portocarrero, Conde de Valdepara√≠so, built his palace here. Almagro flourished due to the patronage both of Philip V of Spain and of Juan Francisco Gaona y Portocarrero, Conde de Valdepara√≠so, who served in Philip's government as head of the Exchequer. The town was named provincial capital of La Mancha, a position it enjoyed from 1750 to 1761. The Conde de Valdepara√≠so, unsuccessful in his attempts to permanently make Almagro an administrative center, promoted commerce, especially in textiles, encouraging the trade in appliqu√© lace and pillow lace (encaje de bolillos). The sale of church lands under Charles III of Spain jeopardized the future of many church buildings in Almagro, and the university disappeared by the 19th century. The Order of Calatrava moved from the uncomfortable location of Castillo de Calatrava la Nueva to the Sacro Convento in Almagro proper, but did not remain permanently. =Nineteenth century= During the Peninsular War, an active Bonapartist masonic lodge was established in Almagro. The town suffered during the Carlist Wars and the sale of church lands by Juan √Ålvarez Mendiz√°bal and Pascual Madoz. During the 19th century, the town faced competition from Ciudad Real and Bola√±os de Calatrava. Almagro built a Plaza de Toros (1845) from materials originally from the stone tower of the ancient parish church of San Bartolom√©, which had been demolished in 1845. The bullfighter Cagancho would later compete in this stadium. The telegraph (1858), railway (1860), and electritown (1897) were introduced during this time. A general headquarters for the cavalry (1863) was established, as were a casino, coliseum, and theater (1864). In 1886, the town walls and gates were demolished. =Twentieth century= During the 1950s, the Corral de Comedias was discovered and restored. The Town Hall and Plaza Mayor were also restored. In 1972, Almagro was declared a Historical-Artistic Zone (Conjunto Hist√≥rico- Art√≠stico). Numerous buildings were restored, including churches, palaces, houses, and hermitages. The National Museum of Theatre was established in a spot near orchards and wine cellars; a special building was later built for it. Almagro became a center for the dramatic arts in the region, and the International Festival of Classical Theater (Festival Internacional de Teatro Cl√°sico) was put on here. Almagro is a candidate for becoming World Heritage Site. Economy Almagro eggplants Cereal, vines, olives, and cotton are grown and cultivated here; there are also livestock and herding. There are also quarries of basalt and mines of manganese and plaster. A traditional industry is the fashioning of appliqu√© lace and pillow lace (encaje de bolillos), crafted by the encajeras. Other industries include woodworking and construction. Almagro is also famous for a variety of small aubergines, berenjenas de Almagro, seasoned and pickled according to a traditional recipe. These are usually eaten as a snack, along with other tapas, such as banderillas. An International Festival of Classical Theater has also been celebrated here annually since 1978.

Sometimes regarded as his first masterpiece, the film follows two shoeshine boys who get into trouble with the police after trying to find the money to buy a horse. Plot Two friends, Giuseppe Filippucci and Pasquale Maggi, test-ride horses. Though they are saving to purchase a horse, it is difficult for them to afford one, as they are only living off their income from shining shoes in the streets of Rome. One day Giuseppe's older brother, Attilio, visits the boys and tells them that Panza (a fence) has some work for them. Pasquale brings Giuseppe along to meet Panza, who gives them two blankets to sell. Giuseppe and Pasquale bring the blankets to a fortune teller, who buys them. After the sale, Panza, Attilio, and another man burst into the fortune teller's house, posing as policemen. They accuse the fortune teller of handling stolen goods, and finding Giuseppe and Pasquale, force them out and pretend to take them into custody. Attilio tells the boys to go away and keep quiet, letting them keep the blanket money (2,800 lira) as well as 3,000 additional lira. With this money, the boys have enough to finally buy a horse. After purchasing their horse and riding it, the boys return to the city. There the real police, accompanied by the fortune teller, bring them into the precinct for questioning. The police accuse the boys of stealing over 700,000 lira from the fortune teller's home, which obviously was stolen by Panza and Attilio, posing as the policemen. The boys deny all charges and do not mention their knowledge of the three true con men. Giuseppe and Pasquale are sent to a juvenile detention center. On arrival, Giuseppe and Pasquale are separated. Giuseppe receives a package from his mother filled with food and shares it with his fellow inmates in his own cell. Another inmate, Arcangeli, finds a note in a piece of the bread Giuseppe shares. It is from Attilio's boss, and it instructs him not to expose his brother and comrades regarding the con. Giuseppe informs Pasquale; they agree not to divulge the truth. Later, the boys are called into the police chief's office for questioning. Frustrated, the chief threatens to beat the information out of them. Another policeman takes Giuseppe into a side room to beat him. Hidden from Pasquale's view, Giuseppe is taken back to his cell, while another child poses as Giuseppe's screaming voice. The policeman proceeds to flay a sandbag, while the child belts out false screams. Pasquale, thinking his friend was in unbearable pain, finally admits the names of Panza and Attilio to the police chief. Giuseppe discovers that Pasquale confessed when his mother visits him and reveals that Attilio, his brother, has been informed on. Giuseppe confronts Pasquale in front of the other inmates, calling him a spy. A file is planted in Pasquale's cell, and Pasquale is flogged. At their official court hearing, Giuseppe and Pasquale are respectively sentenced to one and two years in prison. Giuseppe commits to Arcangeli's escape plan. While a movie is being projected in the prison, they escape. Pasquale tells the police chief where the escapees went and leads them there, but they have already escaped. Pasquale runs off and finds Giuseppe and Arcangeli riding on their horse across a bridge. They dismount and Arcangeli flees, but Giuseppe stays. Pasquale takes off his belt and starts to flog Giuseppe. Giuseppe falls off the bridge and hits his head on the rocks below. Pasquale cries over his fallen friend's body as the police arrive.

In 1948, it received an Honorary Award at the Academy Awards for its high quality. This award was the precursor of what would later become the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Pauline Kael, writing in a review published in 1961, commented: \\"Life, as Shoeshine demonstrates, is too complex for facile endings. Shoeshine was not conceived in the patterns of romance or melodrama; it is one of those rare works of art which seem to emerge from the welter of human experience without smoothing away the raw edges, or losing what most movies lose ‚Äî the sense of confusion and accident in human affairs [....] The greatness of Shoeshine is in that feeling we get of human emotions that have not been worked-over and worked-into something (a pattern? a structure?) and cannot really be comprised in such a structure. We receive something more naked, something that pours out of the screen [....] Shoeshine has a sweetness and a simplicity that suggest greatness of feeling, and this is so rare in film works that to cite a comparison one searches beyond the medium ‚Äî if Mozart had written an opera set in poverty, it might have had this kind of painful beauty [....] This tragic study of the corruption of innocence is intense, compassionate, and above all, humane.\\" Orson Welles said of Shoeshine, \\"What De Sica can do, that I can‚Äôt do. I ran his Shoeshine again recently and the camera disappeared, the screen disappeared; it was just life.‚Äù The film inspired a comic book series, Sciusci√†, which ran from 1949 to 1956.

The text talks about it as the place where Don Quixote is buried, and that the \\"Academicians of Argamasilla\\" meet at the gravesite. Contrary to the foundation of the joke, Argamasilla de Alba has never had a group of academicians working there, and modern Cervantes scholars believe this is a reference to his well-documented imprisonment in the C√°rcel Real of Seville.

Career They were formed by Conny Bloom (real surname: Blomqvist) (guitar/vocals) and Andy Christell (bass). Originally a duo, they signed for Polygram and scored a local Swedish hit with the single \\"All Lips and Hips\\" in 1988, which according to some people is their best song so far. This early version of what would become perhaps the band's best-known hit also appeared that same year in America on the soundtrack to the movie Feds. The band then added second guitarist Franco Santunione and drummer Niclas Sigevall. In 1989, the band's debut album Funk- O-Metal Carpet Ride, including a revamped version of \\"All Lips and Hips\\" was a success in Europe, and they picked up a strong following in Britain, where, as well as headlining small clubs, they supported Thunder. When headlining Newcastle upon Tyne, Riverside club, the band were joined on stage by the lead singer of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Anthony Kiedis, who were performing in the same venue at around the same time. The following year, the album was released in America, where they also became moderately successful, thanks to the singles \\"All Lips and Hips\\" and \\"Psychedelic Eyes\\". However, the follow-up album Groovus Maximus did not emerge until 1992, by which time grunge had swept all before it and the album was overall inferior to the debut. By the end of an American tour to promote it supporting Mr. Big, the band had lost Santunione and Sigevall and both North American and European record deals. Outgoing members were replaced by former Mogg drummer Thomas Broman and Martin Thomander (second guitar) and this line up released the band's third album, Freewheelin' on the Music For Nations label in Britain. The album attracted little interest and the band dissolved. In 2005, founders Bloom and Christell joined Hanoi Rocks. The Groovus Maximus album was recorded at the Abbey Road Studios in London. There were two music videos made from that album: \\"Mary in the Mystery World\\" and \\"Dying to be Loved\\". The \\"Dying to be Loved\\" video only had a budget of ¬£100. The band reformed in 2009 and released And Them Boys Done Swang in 2011. On 24 March 2018, they released a new single, \\"Suffer\\", which was paired with a 2014 live recording of \\"All Lips n' Hips.\\" They are currently working on a follow up to their 2014 album, Starflight United. which is crowdfunded on Pledge Music for release in August 2018. The album, called \\"The Ghost Ward Diaries\\" was released in November 2018.

It is 4 kilometers from Almagro.  History  The first settlement dates back to Roman times. The area became a strategic point for trade and communication, linking Toledo with C√≥rdoba and M√©rida with the Mediterranean Sea. Bola√±os Castle was built to provide housing and protection on the road from Toledo to C√≥rdoba. Possession of the city was contested by the Taifa of C√≥rdoba, the Taifa of Seville and the Taifa of Toledo, after the fragmentation of Al-Andalus. During the Reconquista, the region was in a constant state of siege and battle. With the Christian victory at Las Navas de Tolosa (1212), the area began to repopulate. The city's villa was owned by [Berenguela of Castile]. In 1229, she donated the village to the Order of Calatrava. This grant was confirmed by Fernando III el Santo and later by [Alfonso X of CastileAlfonso X el Sabio]. Bola√±os had large Islamic and Jewish populations until the expulsion of members of these religions in 1492, at which point many of them converted to Christianity.  Geography  The city lies within small Paleozoic mountain ranges, surrounded by shallow creeks, including the Pellejero and de Cuetos. It also lies within a volcanic zone (la Yezosa), which lies upon a quartzite sierra, similar to the zones of Olot and Cabo de Gata in the Iberian Peninsula.  Events  =Holy Week= \\"The Star\\" in the Spanish Square at Holy Week Campo de Calatrava attracts many regional tourists for its odd representation of Holy Week. One of the principal attractions is the marching company of 'Roman soldiers' popularly known as los armaos (the armed ones). A further attraction are religious floats influenced by Andalusian iconography along with church guilds such as Our Lady of Solitude and Jesus of Nazareth. The 'Roman soldiers' belong to the guild of Holy Christ of the Sepulchre as exemplified by works of local artist Jos√© Castellanos Borondo. The highlights of the Calatrava Holy Week are the representations of \\"The Arrest\\" (of Christ), \\"The Fall\\" and the colorful parades of los armaos notable for its sobriety as they silently start the procession from under the porch of San Felipe and Santiago Church. =Our Lady of Mount Pilgrimage= This pilgrimage is the longest established tradition in town, sharing its local bola√±egos spirit with outsiders and visitors. The event is celebrated on the last Sunday of April, in the former \\"Meadow of the Moheda\\" which dates to the time of the military orders of Calatrava. Eight years ago, a chapel was built in the side of a small ridge, in the foothills of Sierra Pelada, to house the image of the Virgin for neighboring towns and villages of Almagro under the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of Moral de Calatrava and Bola√±os de Calatrava. Currently, the site is in a small village that grew around the first chapel of Our Lady of the Mount. Since ancient times, inhabitants of the region, especially bola√±egos, visited the chapel with family and friends, including the consumption of the traditional manchego stew. Today, the duration of the festival extends beyond one day and attracts people from all parts of Spain to celebrate their devotion to the Virgin, as well as to participate in the city's revelry. Of particular interest to visitors is the image of the Virgin wearing an amusing hat, decoration of the chapel with flowers, the hanging of notes on the mantle during the Sunday procession, and the auction of \\"State Authority\\" (a gold medal) at the shrine gates once the pilgrimage is complete. The ceremonies have sometimes generated controversy amongst the clergy and bola√±ega society.

History  Between the Sacred Convent of Calatrava la Nueva and the Castle of Salvatierra there was population and for its defense it had two castles, therefore, it can be assured that it was founded in the first decades of the 13th century, with which, Calzada de Calatrava grew to the shadow and shelter as logistic support of the Castle of Calatrava la Nueva and the Order of Calatrava with its knights, friars and soldiers. The Order of Calatrava monitored and commanded throughout this area until the time of the Catholic Monarchs , the lands remained their property as well as many privileges, however numerous archaeological sites that confirm the human presence in this area from the Paleolithic lower. Although no scientific excavations have been carried out, in various surface surveys some polyhedral cores have been found in the place known as El Alamo , as well as raedera and lascas have been documented in what is known as Casa Calle , located to the north and northeast respectively. The Alamo, located in an elevated area near the Vega de Castellanos stream, before reaching the Parra mill on the Jabal√≥n River , is the most important site that extends from the Neolithic to the Bronze Age . In him certain parallels are found with some nearby deposits in Aldea del Rey, in which, among other materials, polished axes and millstones stand out. The remains we're found in the area of the G√ºedos (polished stone), as well as those found in El Prado (to the north), Pozo Felipe (to the east), and the Neolithic ax found in Cabeza del Encinar (to the south) . During the First Carlist War , the Carlist expedition under Basilio Garc√≠a , who had left Navarra on December 29, 1837, ravaging the lands of both Castillas, was presented on February 25, 1838 in Calzada in front of some 5,000 men. The liberal defenders, both from Calzada and from neighboring towns that had sought refuge here, were locked in the Santa Maria Nuestra Se√±ora del Valle Parish Church, outside the town walls with their women and children. The Carlists with their artillery they demolished the doors, introduced beams of wood and other woods to which they set fire. The prisoners did not accept giving up and the vault eventually collapsed, resulting in the death of 110 men, 25 women and 29 children. The plot of the church was subsequently used as a cemetery, then as a Civil Guard barracks and is currently a park where you can still see some stone blocks of the old church. On January 22, 1895 the regent queen Maria Cristina of Habsburg on behalf of her son, King Alfonso XIII , granted the title of city to the village of La Calzada. In 2011, on the occasion of the World Youth Day , the Pope's cross and the icon visited this town.

Year 1215. - King Henry I of Castile, gives Carrizosa, among other places, the Count Don Alvaro Nunez de Lara, so that they are repopulated, specifying the assignment in another document dated 1217. Year 1243. - The Order of Santiago and Alcaraz council clash over ownership of the Campo de Montiel castles, villages and wilds, Carrizosa amongst them. Year 1387. - Is granted Carrizosa entrusted to Pedro Diaz de Monsalve, first known commander, who kept it until the year 1409. They follow a series of commanders until the parcel is the youngest son of Don Rodrigo Manrique, Enrique Manrique. The population at the time, would be about 90 habitanes . In these years, the castle is definitely abandoned and the population is settled in its current location, on the banks of the river Carrizosa (currently Canyamares ) .

In the following years of the seventeenth century, the commanders of the parcel leased land to people who were in charge of collecting tithes to the neighbors. There are several relationships heritage of the charge made in different years, that account for the possessions they had in the same town or area. Year 1787. - In the Census of Floridablanca, consists Carrizosa as villa, with ordinary mayor belonging to the military order of Santiago . Its inhabitants were 349, of which 263 were listed as minor and profession. Highlights 38 laborers, 26 farmers and 14 servants.

Available in the National Library of Madrid. Myths, Legends and Traditions =Festive and culinary traditions= San Anton Carrizosa exist and existed in many traditions associated with the celebration of the feast of this saint on January 17 . Formerly, until about 60 years, men on horseback roamed the streets of the town, competing to collect cakes for San Anton being thrown from balconies and windows. The cake had a similar development of San Blas rolls that comment later. Another tradition associated with the saint was the fifth . Named for the old system of military service by redeeming one in five, fifth . Posibiblemente also related to some ancient form of protest, tore the curtains fifths of the doors of the houses in the nights leading up to January 17 . The night of 16 January 17 fires were lit in the streets but most of it was the main square of wood which was collected by the fifth . Around the fires ate, drank and danced dances to the sound of the old songs also related to this event . Another even older tradition and unused for more than half a century was to release a pig (animal traditionally linked to the saint ) by the town's streets fed by all the neighbors. Hence there Carrizosa expression \\" be like the guttural of San Ant√≥n \\" in reference to street life of it. Rolls of San Blas and St. Agatha . It is celebrated since ancient saints days 3 and 5 February . Loaves consist of small irregularly shaped oval tending to be made with flour, water, oil, salt and aniseed ( aniseed ) without yeast so the result is a crispy bread . The tradition that once marked should be baked the day before Mass to be blessed saints . It is usually done by religious promise or request for favor agredecimiento the saints ( related to diseases of the throat or voice in the case of San Blas or illnesses related to the chest of St. Agatha ) . Families that are written by the children shared that early morning, tour the houses where the deals. Tostones . Like the previous case, is a culinary tradition . The croutons are a type of nougat made family so the night of 31 October. Is performed based on molten sugar mixed with almonds and walnuts . Peanuts may also be added .

Cross the May [ edit ¬∑ edit font ] The feast of you the Cross of May is held between April 30, 2, 3 and 4 May . During the evening a young Rondalla march through the village singing the Ladies Mays . On day 2 he sings to the Crosses ( altars placed in the houses ) and are held treats. Its origin is pagan feast of excitement as spring and has variations across the Spanish geography . In our region have been held in many localities, but where they remain with all their traditional Carrizosa is . At Christianized, these parties became an exaltation of the Cross as a symbol of the Passion of Jesus. Basically they consist, in its most traditional, in the ornamentation of a cross -based floral and plant elements ( reminiscent of its ancient meaning ), along with symbols of the Passion ( the nails, the crown of thorns, etc.). May this celebration really begins on the evening of April 30 and continues through the early morning of May 1, during which, gangs of young men ( and now also wenches ) dedicated their songs to the beloved women ( wives, girlfriends, family ) in what is called \\" ladies night \\" . It starts with a traditional song called \\" in May \\", in which, through its various stanzas ( the first of which is to apply for leave of the lady), they will \\" draw\\" the perfections of a woman's body : Noted for their interest altars of Corpus Christi, whose feast is celebrated in June.

The second vessel named after a county in North Dakota, the LST was constructed by National Steel and Shipbuilding Company of San Diego, California. The vessel was launched and was commissioned into the USN in 1971. La Moure County alternated deployments in the Caribbean Sea with those to the Mediterranean Sea. During the Gulf War, La Moure County transported elements of the 4th Marine Expeditionary Brigade to the Persian Gulf. In 2000, the LST was taking part in a training exercise off Chile when the vessel ran aground. Considered beyond repair, La Moure County was decommissioned that year and towed out to sea in 2001 and sunk as a target ship. Design and description La Moure County was a which were designed to meet the goal put forward by the United States amphibious forces to have a tank landing ship (LST) capable of over . However, the traditional bow door form for LSTs would not be capable. Therefore, the designers of the Newport class came up with a design of a traditional ship hull with a aluminum ramp slung over the bow supported by two derrick arms. The ramp was capable of sustaining loads up to . This made the Newport class the first to depart from the standard LST design that had been developed in early World War II. The LST had a displacement of when light and at full load. La Moure County was long overall and over the derrick arms which protruded past the bow. The vessel had a beam of , a draft forward of and at the stern at full load. La Moure County was fitted with six Alco 16-645-ES diesel engines turning two shafts, three to each shaft. The system was rated at and gave the ship a maximum speed of for short periods and could only sustain for an extended length of time. The LST carried of diesel fuel for a range of at the cruising speed of . The ship was also equipped with a bow thruster to allow for better maneuvering near causeways and to hold position while offshore during the unloading of amphibious vehicles. The Newport class were larger and faster than previous LSTs and were able to transport tanks, heavy vehicles and engineer groups and supplies that were too large for helicopters or smaller landing craft to carry. The LSTs have a ramp forward of the superstructure that connects the lower tank deck with the main deck and a passage large enough to allow access to the parking area amidships. The vessels are also equipped with a stern gate to allow the unloading of amphibious vehicles directly into the water or to unload onto a utility landing craft (LCU) or pier. At either end of the tank deck there is a turntable that permits vehicles to turn around without having to reverse. The Newport class has the capacity for of vehicles, of cargo area and could carry up to 431 troops. The vessels also have davits for four vehicle and personnel landing craft (LCVPs) and could carry four pontoon causeway sections along the sides of the hull. La Moure County was initially armed with four Mark 33 /50 caliber guns in two twin turrets. The vessel was equipped with two Mk 63 gun control fire systems (GCFS) for the 3-inch guns, but these were removed in 1977‚Äì1978. The ship also had SPS-10 surface search radar. Atop the stern gate, the vessels mounted a helicopter deck. They had a maximum complement of 213 including 11 officers. Construction and career The LST was ordered as the seventh hull of the third group of the Newport class in Fiscal Year 1967 and a contract was awarded on 15 July 1966.Naval Vessel Register The ship was laid down on 22 May 1970 by the National Steel and Shipbuilding Company in San Diego, California. Named for a county in North Dakota, La Moure County was launched on 13 February 1971 and commissioned into the United States Navy (USN) on 18 December 1971. The ship was assigned to Amphibious Force, Atlantic Fleet and transited the Panama Canal to arrive at the vessel's new home port of Little Creek, Virginia. La Moure County alternated between training operations along the east coast of the United States and the Caribbean Sea and active deployments in the Mediterranean Sea and European waters. During the Gulf War, La Moure County was part of Amphibious Group 2 (PhibGru2). Tasked with transporting part of the 4th Marine Expeditionary Brigade (4th MEB) via the Mediterranean to the Persian Gulf, the group was divided up into transit groups, with La Moure County joining Transit Group 3. Transit Group 3 departed Morehead City, North Carolina on 21 August 1990 and united with the other transit groups off Masirah Island on 16 September. Transit Group 3 rejoined PhibGru2. PhibGru2 was split back into respective transit groups on 24 March 1991 and Transit Group 2 returned to Little Creek on 17 April after a ceasefire had been declared on 1 April. In 1995 the ship was transferred to the Naval Reserve Force. =Grounding and aftermath= La Moure County at anchor in Cifuncho Bay, where the ship lay from 12 September to 28 October 2000 Ex-La Moure County as seen here during the first phase of the SINKEX on 10 July 2001 Ex-La Moure County overhead view showing the ship later in the SINKEX exercise, burning after several missile hits The ship was run aground near the coast of Caleta Cifuncho Bay, Chile, in the pre-dawn hours of 12 September 2000 during a routine amphibious training operation with a sister vessel, the Chilean Navy's . A combination of the speed of the ship at impact and the incoming tide resulted in extensive damage to the bow, keel, screws, and rudders. Extensive internal flooding and the dumping of of diesel fuel only served to complicate matters. No injuries were suffered by the crew or marines aboard the ship. Following the grounding, it was found that the captain of the ship had failed to chart his position correctly. This incident led to a complete standdown by all USN vessels to assess their safety and navigation protocols. La Moure Countys grounding, along with several navigational mishaps by other USN vessels led to the USN re-assessing its training in navigation. The USN ordered new simulation training for bridge officers. La Moure County was deemed damaged beyond repair. The ship was decommissioned and struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 17 November 2000. After five weeks of work by divers stabilizing the vessel, La Moure County was towed by the to Talcahuano, Chile where further repairs were deemed uneconomical. Having been stripped of all usable material, the damaged hulk of La Moure County was towed out to sea and sunk as a target on 10 July 2001 during UNITAS 2001.

The double bonds are commonly alkene groups but those with a carbonyl (C=O) group are also called radialenes. For some members the unsubstituted parent radialenes are elusive but many substituted derivatives are known. Radialenes are related to open- chain dendralenes and also to compounds like butadiene and benzene which also consist of a ring of sp2 hybridized carbon atoms. Radialenes are investigated in organic chemistry for their unusual properties and reactivity but have not ventured outside the laboratory. Reported uses are as experimental building blocks for novel organic conductors and ferromagnets. The first radialene called hexaethylidencyclohexane was synthesised in 1961. Conformation [3] and [4]radialenes are expected to have a planar molecular geometry with all carbon atoms in the same plane. This is verified experimentally in hexamethyl[3]radialene and cyclobutanetetraonetetrakis(hydrazone). Decamethyl[5]radialene has a twist envelope geometry with C2 symmetry while a chair conformation is calculated for [6]radialene and found experimentally for hexa-(ethylidene)cyclohexane Due to their specific pi-electron distributions, hydrocarbons such as perylene and triphenylene are not considered radialenes. One study describes a [6]radialene composed of thiophene units: :Planar radicalene Patra 2007 This compound is reported as planar with D3h symmetry (X-ray diffraction) but not aromatic: the carbon-carbon bond lengths are unusually long (145 pm vs. 140 pm for benzene) and the calculated NICS value is close to zero. Synthesis and properties The parent [3],[4],[5] and [6]radialenes polymerize when in contact with oxygen. =[3]Radialenes= [3]Radialene or trimethylenecyclopropane was synthesised in 1965. Reported derivatives are triquinocyclopropanes, salts of trimethylenecyclopropane dianions, tris(thioxanthen-9-ylidene)cyclopropane, tris(fluoren-9-ylidene)cyclopropane and hexakis(trimethylsilylethynyl)[3]radialene. Phosphorus derivatives (based on 4,5,6-triphospha[3]radialene) have also been reported. Phospharadialenes have been investigated as quantum efficiency improvers in solar cells Hexakis[4-(diarylamino)phenyl][3]radialene derivatives have been investigated for their low oxidation potentials. =[4]Radialenes= The unsubstituted [4]radialene has been prepared in an elimination reaction of cis,trans,cis- tetra(bromomethyl)cyclobutane with sodium methoxide in ethanol. [4]radialene synthesis Hydrogenation with platinum on carbon gives cis,cis,cis- tetramethylcyclobutane in accordance with the proposed structure.

The western terminus of the route is at PA 10 in Upper Oxford Township. The eastern terminus is at PA 3 in the Philadelphia suburb of Willistown Township. The route is known as Street Road for its entire length. For , PA 926 runs along the county line between Delaware and Chester Counties. The route passes through a mix of suburban and rural areas along its extent. PA 926 is two lanes and undivided its entire length. In colonial times, William Penn laid out a road in Marlborough Township called Marlborough Street. This road would be incorporated into a road surveyed in 1815 called Street Road that ran between Philadelphia and the Susquehanna River. PA 926 was first designated by 1928 on a different alignment running from U.S. Route 122 (US 122, now US 202/US 322) east to PA 129, a route that was designated along Street Road between US 122 and PA 352. By 1930, PA 926 was designated along Street Road between US 122 and PA 352, replacing PA 129. PA 926 was extended to its current length in 1937. Route description PA 926 westbound past the eastern terminus at PA 3 in Willistown Township PA 926 begins at an intersection with PA 10 in Upper Oxford Township, Chester County, heading northeast on two-lane undivided Street Road. The road passes through farmland with some trees and homes, crossing the East Branch Big Elk Creek into Londonderry Township. The route continues east through rural areas and passes near a few residential developments before it intersects PA 796 in the community of Daleville. PA 926 runs past more farms and reaches a junction with PA 41. Past this intersection, the road curves southeast and parallels PA 41 for a short distance before turning to the east. The route becomes the border between West Marlborough Township to the north and London Grove Township to the south, passing to the north of a landfill before it continues through more agricultural areas with some woods and homes, intersecting PA 841. Farther east, PA 926 fully enters West Marlborough Township and reaches the community of London Grove, where it briefly turns south at an intersection with Newark Road prior to turning east again. The road continues through rural areas and briefly becomes the border between West Marlborough Township to the north and East Marlborough Township to the south before fully entering East Marlborough Township, where it passes to the north of the University of Pennsylvania's New Bolton Center and to the south of a residential development before intersecting PA 82 in Willowdale. Following this intersection, the route runs east through a mix of farmland and woodland with some residential areas. PA 926 crosses into Pennsbury Township and immediately intersects PA 52, at which point it heads more to the east-northeast. The road passes through wooded areas with some fields and residences, crossing into Pocopson Township. The route intersects Pocopson Road and crosses an East Penn Railroad line at-grade in the community of Pocopson. Past this, PA 926 crosses the Brandywine Creek into Birmingham Township. Just after crossing the Brandywine Creek, the route intersects Creek Road. The road continues northeast and runs through a mix of residential developments, fields, and woods. PA 926 becomes the border between Westtown Township to the northwest and Thornbury Township to the southeast as it passes through more suburban development with some farms. The route crosses US 202/US 322 in the community of Darlington Corners, where it passes near some commercial development. The road heads through wooded areas of residential neighborhoods and reaches the community of Westtown, where it passes over the West Chester Railroad. PA 926 runs past residential areas with some farm fields as it passes to the north of the Cheyney University of Pennsylvania campus, with access to the university provided by Cheyney Road. The route becomes the border between Westtown Township, Chester County to the northwest and Thornbury Township, Delaware County to the southeast as it runs past more residential subdivisions and intersects PA 352. Past the PA 352 intersection, the road turns north to fully enter Westtown Township, Chester County, passing fields and woods. The route curves northeast again and crosses into Willistown Township, where it passes through wooded areas of homes. PA 926 reaches its eastern terminus at an intersection with PA 3. History PA 926 eastern terminus at PA 3 in Willistown Township Street Road dates back to colonial times, when a straight road in Marlborough Township was laid out by William Penn and was named Marlborough Street, running from Pennsbury Township to the Marlborough Friends Meetinghouse. In 1815, a road was surveyed between Market Street in Philadelphia and McCalls Ferry on the Susquehanna River to facilitate the westward expansion of settlers. This new road followed the alignment of Marlborough Street. This road became known as Street Road, named after Marlborough Street that it followed. When Pennsylvania first legislated its routes in 1911, Street Road was not given a route number. By 1928, Street Road existed as a paved road between London Grove and Red Lion and from US 122/PA 29 (now US 202/US 322) in Thornbury to PA 352 in Tanguy. PA 129 was designated along the portion of road between US 122/PA 29 and PA 352. PA 926 was first designated by 1928 to run from US 122/PA 29 east to PA 129 along unpaved Oakbourne Road and paved Concord Road and Westbourne Road. By 1930, PA 926 was realigned to follow Street Road between US 122 and PA 352, replacing the PA 129 designation on this stretch which was shifted to a road further south. In 1937, PA 926 was extended along Street Road to its current length between PA 10 near Russellville and PA 3 near Westtown. By 1940, the entire route was paved. PA 926 has remained along the same alignment since. Major intersections PA 926 Alternate Truck Pennsylvania Route 926 Alternate Truck is a truck route bypassing a weight-restricted bridge over Radley Run in Thornbury Township, on which trucks over 36 tons and combination loads over 40 tons are prohibited. Formed in 2013, it follows PA 52, US 1, and US 202/US 322.

He played once for the England national side. Playing career Hadley was born in Barrow-in-Furness and joined Halesowen in 1895 from Colley Gate United. In February 1897 he joined West Bromwich Albion where he established himself at wing-half. He won a Second Division title medal with the Baggies in 1902 and in February 1903 won his only England cap in the 4‚Äì0 win against Ireland at Molineux. In February 1905, after 167 league games, he left West Brom to join Aston Villa for a fee of ¬£250, but played just 11 times before joining Nottingham Forest in April 1906. A year later he moved again, this time to Southern League Southampton. According to Holley & Chalk's \\"The Alphabet of the Saints\\" he was \\"a methodical yet energetic half-back, dedicated to looking after the forwards by supporting, feeding and directing them into advantageous positions\\". At the end of the 1907‚Äì08 season he moved to Croydon Common, rejoining Halesowen in February 1910. He finished his playing career with Merthyr Town. Managerial career Hadley's first managerial job was with Merthyr Town where he was appointed in May 1919. He oversaw their promotion to the Football League in 1920 and guided them to 8th place in Division Three (South) in their first season. He left Merthyr in April 1922 to manage Chesterfield, but left in August the same year. In November 1927 he took over at Aberdare Athletic, who had failed to gain re-election to the Football League the previous season. He left in April 1928, returning to Merthyr Town as manager, but left again in November the same year. He began a third spell as Merthyr manager in 1930, leaving in September 1931. His final managerial job was with Bangor City who he joined in July 1935 and left in April 1936 when he retired. Hadley's brother Ben also played professionally for West Bromwich Albion, but had left before Harry's arrival at the Hawthorns.

History Throughout the history of the United States until the end of World War I, the Navy had enlisted African Americans for general service, but they were barred from joining from 1919 to 1932. From 1893 onwards, African Americans could only join the Navy‚Äôs Messman‚Äôs and Steward‚Äôs branches, which not only segregated African Americans from the rest of the Navy community, but also precluded them from becoming commissioned officers. In June 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the executive order (8802) that prohibited racial discrimination by any government agency.Danelo, 2005. In April 1942, thanks to protests and pressure from civil rights leaders and the black press, the Navy allowed black men into the general service ratings for the first time. Responding to pressure from First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt and Assistant Secretary of the Navy Adlai Stevenson, in January 1944, the Navy began an officer training course for 16 African-American enlisted men at Camp Robert Smalls, Recruit Training Center Great Lakes (now known as Great Lakes Naval Training Station), in Illinois. To ensure their failure,Wall Street Journal, August 7, 2020, p.A15 the normal training period of 16 weeks was reduced to 8 weeks for the black cadets. When they realized that someone in the Navy wanted them to wash out, the cadets covered up the windows of their barracks and studied all night. When they were tested, the entire group passed with high marks. Disbelief in the chain of command that an all-black cadet class could achieve higher scores than an all-white one meant that the black sailors had to suffer the indignity of retaking their tests. Again, all 16 passed; the class average at graduation was 3.89. Although all sixteen members of the class passed the course, only twelve were commissioned in March 1944: John Walter Reagan (1920-1994), Jesse Walter Arbor (1914-2000), Dalton Louis Baugh, Sr., Frank Ellis Sublett, Graham Edward Martin (born 1917), Phillip George Barnes, Reginald E. Goodwin, James Edward Hair (1915-1992), Samuel Edward Barnes, George Clinton Cooper, William S. White, and Dennis Denmark Nelson were commissioned as Ensigns; and Charles Byrd Lear (1920-2006) was appointed as a Warrant Officer. Because Navy policy prevented them from being assigned to combatant ships, early black officers wound up being detailed to run labor gangs ashore. Postwar President Harry S. Truman officially desegregated the U.S. military in 1948. At the time of the Golden Thirteen's commissioning, there were approximately 100,000 African- American men serving in the United States Navy's enlisted ranks. Frank E. Sublett, the last living member of the group, died in 2006. The Golden Thirteen's Legacy In 1987, the U.S. Navy reunited the seven living members to dedicate a building in their honor at Great Lakes Naval Recruit Training Command, Illinois. Today, Building 1405 at RTC Great Lakes, where recruits first arrive for basic training, is named \\"The Golden Thirteen\\" in honor of them. In 2006, ground was broken on a World War II memorial in North Chicago, Illinois to honor the Golden Thirteen and Dorie Miller. See also *List of African-American firsts *Samuel L.

These origin theories typically involve contact with Old World societies. Although these speculations have become somewhat well-known within popular culture, particularly the idea of an African connection to the Olmec, they are not regarded as credible by mainstream researchers of Mesoamerica and are considered fringe theories. Mainstream scientific consensus The great majority of scholars who specialize in Mesoamerican history, archaeology and linguistics remain unconvinced by alternative origin speculations.See Grove (1976) or Ortiz de Montellano (1997). Many are more critical and regard the promotion of such unfounded theories as a form of ethnocentric racism at the expense of indigenous Americans.*Robbing Native American Cultures: Van Sertima's Afrocentricity and the Olmecs an article from Current Anthropology. The consensus view maintained across publications in peer-reviewed academic journals that are concerned with Mesoamerican and other pre-Columbian research is that the Olmec and their achievements arose from influences and traditions that were wholly indigenous to the region, or at least the New World, and there is no reliable material evidence to suggest otherwise.Taube, p. 17. \\"There simply is no material evidence of any Pre-Hispanic contact between the Old World and Mesoamerica before the arrival of the Spanish in the sixteenth century.\\" They, and their neighbouring cultures with whom they had contact, developed their own characters which were founded entirely on a remarkably interlinked and ancient cultural and agricultural heritage that was locally shared, but arose independently of any extra-hemispheric influences.Diehl (2004); Coe (1968). African origins San Lorenzo Tenochtitl√°n Colossal Head 6, a 3-meter-high Olmec sculpture with lips and nose said to resemble African facial features. Some writers claim that the Olmecs were related to peoples of Africa - based primarily on their interpretation of facial features of Olmec statues. They additionally contend that epigraphical, genetic, and osteological evidence supports their claims. The idea was first suggested by Jos√© Melgar, who discovered the first colossal head at Hueyapan (now Tres Zapotes) in 1862 and subsequently published two papers that attributed this head to a \\"Negro race.\\"Stirling, p. 2, who cites Melgar (1869) and Melgar (1871). The view was espoused in the early 20th century by Leo Wiener and others.Ort√≠z de Montellano, Bernard & Gabriel Haslip Viera & Warren Barbour 1997 Some modern proponents such as Ivan Van Sertima and Clyde Ahmad Winters have identified the Olmecs with the Mand√© people of West Africa. =Claims of epigraphic evidence= Some researchers claim that the Mesoamerican writing systems are related to African scripts. In the early 19th century, Constantine Samuel Rafinesque proposed that the Maya inscriptions were probably related to the Libyco-Berber writing of Africa.C. S. Rafinesque, \\"First letter to Mr. Champollion on the Graphic systems of Otolum or Palenque in Central America\\", in The Decipherment of Ancient Maya Writing, Houston, S. et al., Norman, OK: University of Oklahoma Press (2001), (pp. 45-47); and C. S. Rafinesque, \\"Second letter to Mr. Champollion--Elements of the Glyphs\\", ibid., pp. 48-53. Leo WienerLeo Wiener, Africa and the Discovery of America, Volume 3, Philadelphia, PA: Innes & Sons (1922) p. 271. and others claim that various Olmec and Epi-Olmec symbols are similar to those found in the Vai script (a relatively modern script in Liberia which may have Cherokee influence), in particular, the symbols on the Tuxtla Statuette, Teo Mask, Cascajal Block, and the celts in Offering 4 at La Venta. These assertions have found no support among Mesoamerican researchers. While mainstream scholars have made significant progress translating the Maya script, researchers have yet to translate Olmec glyphs. =Genetic studies= Genetic and immunological studies over the past two decades have failed to yield evidence of precolumbian African contributions to the indigenous populations of the Americas. =Claims of osteological evidence= Andrzej Wiercinski claims that some of the Olmecs were of African origin.Rensberger, B. (September, 1988). \\"Black kings of ancient America\\", Science Digest, 74-77 and 122. See also Wiercinski, A. (1972a) \\"An anthropological study on the origin of 'Olmecs'\\", Swiatowit, 33, p. 143-174. He supports this claim with cranial evidence from two Mesoamerican sites: Tlatilco and Cerro de las Mesas. Tlatilco is a site in the Valley of Mexico. Although outside the Olmec heartland, Olmec influences appear in the architectural record. The crania were from the Pre-Classic period, contemporary with the Olmec. Cerro de las Mesa is within the Olmec heartland, although according to Wiercinski, \\"the series . . . is dated on the Classic period.\\"Wiercinski (1972b). The Classic period is generally defined to start around AD 250, or 600 years after the end of the Olmec culture. To determine the racial heritage of the skeletons, Wiercinski used classic diagnostic traits, determined by craniometric and cranioscopic methods, as well as the Polish Comparative-Morphological School skeletal reference collection. These measurements were then compared against three crania sets from Poland, Mongolia and Uganda to represent three racial categories which allowed Wiercinski to sort each skull into one or more racial categories. Based on his comparisons, Wiercinski found that 14% of the skeletons from Tlatilco and 4.5% of the skeletons from Cerro de las Mesas had elements of \\"Black\\" racial composition. In the last section of his paper, Wiercinski compared the physiognomy of the skeletons to corresponding examples of Olmec sculptures and bas-reliefs on the stelas. For example, Wiercinski states that the colossal Olmec heads represent the \\"Dongolan\\" type.Wiercinski (1972b), p.160 The empirical frequencies of the Dongolan type at Tlatilco calculated by Wiercinski was 0.231, more than twice as high as Wiercinski's theoretical figure of 0.101, for the presence of Dongolans at Tlatilco. Wiercinski summarizes his research by offering the following \\"ethnogenetical hypotheses\\":Wiercinski, p. 158 or p. 171. * The indigenous rootstock of Tlatilco and Cerro de las Mesas consists of \\"Ainoid, Arctic, and Pacific racial elements\\". * \\"A next migratory wave\\" brought in additional Pacific as well as \\"Laponoid\\" elements. * \\"Some Chinese influence of Shang Period could penetrate Mesoamerica\\" * \\"A strange transatlantic, more or less sporadic migration\\" brought Armenoid, Equatorial, and Bushmenoid elements. Wiercinski's research methods and conclusions are not accepted by the vast majority of Mesoamerican scholars, in part because of his reliance on the Polish Comparative-Morphological methodology which limits the placement of skull types within a very narrow spectrum that is often within Caucasoid, Negroid, and Mongoloid. Native Americans are thus made to fit within these groups which often yields false and contradictory assumptions as a result of sample bias. An interdisciplinary analysis of Native American skulls has shown that there is no real evidence, apart from superficial misjudgments and erroneous conclusions, that Native Americans have any link to an African presence in America before the European encounter.Rolando Gonz√°lez-Jos√© et al. \\"The Peopling of America: Craniofacial Shape Variation on a Continental Scale and Its Interpretation from an Interdisciplinary View.\\" [PDF file]. American Journal of Physical Anthropology 137, no. 2 (2008): 175-187. Olmec baby figurine. Gordon Ekholm, who was an archaeologist and curator at the American Museum of Natural History, suggested that the Olmec art style might have originated in Bronze Age China.Pool, p. 92, who cites Gordon Ekholm (1964) \\"Transpacific Contacts\\" in Prehistoric Man in the New World JD Jennings and E. Norbeck, eds., Chicago: University of Chicago, pp. 489‚Äî510. Chinese origins Some researchers have argued that the Olmec civilization came into existence with the help of Chinese refugees, particularly at the end of the Shang dynasty.This theory is mentioned in the history book The Rise of the West: A History of the Human Community (1963) by William H. McNeill In 1975, Betty Meggers of the Smithsonian Institution argued that the Olmec civilization originated due to Shang Chinese influences around 1200 BC.Meggers. In a 1996 book, Mike Xu, with the aid of Chen Hanping, claimed that the very same La Venta celts discussed above actually bore Chinese characters. These claims are unsupported by mainstream Mesoamerican researchers.See for example Grove (1976). The evidence relied on by Mike Xu, including the coincidence of markings on Olmec pottery with those on Chinese oracle bone writings, the significance of jade in both cultures and the shared knowledge of the position of true North, was discussed in an article by Claire Liu in 1997.Âè∞ÁÅ£ÂÖâËèØÈõúË™å Taiwan-Panorama.com. Retrieved 8 September 2018. Jaredite origins In the Book of Mormon, a text regarded as scripture by churches and members of the Latter Day Saint movement, the Jaredites are described as a people who left the Old World in ancient times and founded a civilization in the Americas. Mainstream American History and Literature specialists place the literary setting for the Book of Mormon among the ‚ÄúMound-builders‚Äù of North America. The work is therefore classified in the American ‚ÄúMound-builder‚Äù genre of the 19th century.Roger G. Kennedy, Hidden Cities: The Discovery and Loss of Ancient North American Civilization, 1994, pp. 228-231; Robert Silverberg, ‚Äúand the mound-builders vanished from the earth‚Äù,American Heritage Magazine, June 1969, Volume 20, Issue 4 LDS scholars and authors seek to demonstrate that events described in the Book of Mormon have a literal foundation. A popular Book of Mormon geography model places the scene of the Jaredite arrival and subsequent development, in lands around the Isthmus of Tehuantepec in Mesoamerica.Southerton (2004, p.157) The tradition leading to this Central American model, however, does not clearly originate with the Book of Mormon (first published in 1830) but with enthusiastic interest in John Lloyd Stephens‚Äô 1841 bestseller, Incidents of travel in Central America, Chiapas and Yucatan.Coon, W. Vincent, Choice Above All Other Lands ‚Äì Book of Mormon Covenant Lands According to the Best Sources, Ch. 4, ‚ÄúUnsigned Articles and a Popular Book‚Äù, pp. 64-104 LDS founder Joseph Smith Jr. placed the arrival of the Jaredites in ‚Äúthe lake country of America‚Äù (region of Lake Ontario), allowing for the eventual migration of Book of Mormon peoples to Mexico and Central America.Joseph Smith (editor), ‚ÄúTraits of the Mosaic History Found Among the Aztaeca Nations‚Äù, Times and Seasons, June 15, 1842, Vol. 3, No. 16, pp 818-820; signed with Joseph Smith‚Äôs ‚ÄúED‚Äù. Joseph Smith comments on a chapter from Josiah Priest‚Äôs American Antiquities and Discoveries in the West. Coon notes that Joseph Smith uses precisely the same description as Priest, Humboldt and others in describing the Great Lakes region as ‚Äúthe lake country‚Äù. See, ‚ÄúLake‚Äù, The Book of Mormon & ‚ÄúMound- Builder‚Äù America Some LDS scholars identify the Olmec civilization with the Jaredites, citing similarities and noting that the period in which the Olmecs flourished and later declined corresponds roughly with the Jaredite civilization timeline, although most disagree with this idea. Nordic origins Detail of the carved portrait nicknamed \\"Uncle Sam\\" by researchers According to Michael Coe, explorer and cultural diffusionist Thor Heyerdahl claimed that at least some of the Olmec leadership had Nordic ancestry, a view at least partly inspired by the bearded figure, often referred to as \\"Uncle Sam\\",see Coe (1968, p.59) carved into La Venta Stela 3, whose apparent aquiline nose has been cited as possible evidence for ancient visitors to the Americas from the Old World: > \\"The presence of Uncle Sam inspired Thor Heyerdahl, the Norwegian explorer > and author of Kon Tiki, among others to claim a Nordic ancestry for at least > some of the Olmec leadership... [However], it is extremely misleading to use > the testimony of artistic representations to prove ethnic theories. The > Olmec were American Indians, not Negroes (as Melgar had thought) or Nordic > supermen.\\"Coe. p. 55 In popular culture The Olmec Football Player is a 1980 short story by Katherine MacLean. In it, at least one of the Olmec colossal heads depicts an African-American college student who traveled back in time while wearing his football helmet.

Academic career From 1930 to 1934 Grewe studied law at Hamburg, Berlin, Freiburg and Frankfurt. He then worked as an assistant to Professor Ernst Forsthof at the University of Hamburg, and in 1936 he was awarded a doctorate (Dr. jur.). His doctoral thesis was entitled Gnade und Recht (Mercy and Law). From 1936 to 1937 he was at the University of K√∂nigsberg and from 1937 to 1939 at the Deutsches Institut f√ºr au√üenpolitische Forschung (German Institute for Foreign Policy Research) in Berlin, where he was responsible for International Law. From 1939 Grewe lectured at the Hochschule f√ºr Politik (School of Politics) in Berlin, which, in 1940, was incorporated into the new Auslandswissenschaftliche Fakult√§t (Faculty of Foreign Studies) at the Friedrich Wilhelm University of Berlin, where he served as lecturer in \\"Legal Foundations of Foreign Policy\\". In 1941 Grewe was awarded his habilitation on the basis of work that was later to become part of his book Epochen der V√∂lkerrechtsgeschichte, and he lectured at the Faculty of Foreign Studies and the Faculty of Law (in Berlin). In 1942 he was appointed extraordinary professor at the Faculty of Foreign Studies, where he taught \\"Legal Foundations of Foreign Policy\\" and \\"Policy of International Law\\" (V√∂lkerrechtspolitik). After World War II, Grewe taught at the University of G√∂ttingen from 1945 to 1947 and then in Freiburg im Breisgau from 1947. Private life In 1943 Grewe married Marianne Partsch. Diplomatic career Wilhelm Grewe served under Konrad Adenauer in the post-war years, from 1951 to 1955, heading the delegation negotiating the end of Allied occupation of West Germany, which led to the signing of the Convention on Relations between the Three Powers and the Federal Republic (Deutschlandvertrag) in 1954.

The school's name is commonly abbreviated VASJ. It was formed by the 1990 merger of Villa Angela Academy (all girls) and St. Joseph High School (all boys). It is owned by the Catholic Diocese of Cleveland. The school's core values are grounded in those of the religious orders which had administered the two predecessor schools: the Society of Mary (Marianists) (Saint Joseph High School) and the Ursulines (Villa Angela Academy). History =Villa Angela Academy= Villa Angela Academy was founded in the mid-1870s, as a boarding school and academy for girls, by the Ursuline Sisters of Cleveland on property they had purchased on the southern shore of Lake Erie at the mouth of Euclid Creek. The school moved into a new building in 1972. Their athletic teams were nicknamed the Skylarks (Larks) Villa Angela Academy had over 6,000 graduates. =St. Joseph High School= St. Joseph High School was opened in 1950 on the site of Boulevard Hospital, a general hospital which closed in 1937 (originally, the Cunningham Sanitarium - a facility designed to use pressurized atmosphere as an aid in the treatment of disease). Bishop Edward Francis Hoban had asked the Society of Mary (Marianists) from Dayton, Ohio to administer the school. The school's mascot was the Viking due to the school's proximity to Lake Erie. St. Joseph has over 10,000 graduates. =Villa Angela - St. Joseph High School= In 1988, the Diocese announced plans to merge these two schools into a new co- educational school that would serve the needs of the east side of Cleveland. The new school would keep both schools' names and traditions. It would be named \\"Villa Angela - St. Joseph High School\\" and be located at the St. Joseph building. The mascot would remain the Viking. Academics VASJ has several academic programs including: * College Preparatory Program * Honors/Advanced Placement Program * General Skills Program * Learning disability Program Athletics VASJ competes in Ohio High School Athletic Association (OHSAA). VASJ currently competes independent from a conference in all sports. VASJ was a member of the Crown Conference from 1967-1980 (as St. Joseph) and the North Coast League from 2004-2020.

They live in the Arusha and Manyara regions of north-central Tanzania, near the Rift Valley wall and south of Ngorongoro Crater. History =Kerio Valley= The Iraqw have traditionally been viewed as remnants of a Neolithic Afro-Asiatic peoples who practiced agriculture and animal husbandry in the Great Lakes region ‚Äî a succession of societies collectively known as the Stone Bowl cultural complex. Most of these early northern migrants are believed to have been absorbed by later movements of Nilotic and Bantu peoples. In the Kerio Valley of Kenya, among other neighboring areas, there are vestiges of the Neolithic tillers' civilization in the form of elaborate irrigation systems. Although these particular structures are today maintained by the Marakwet subgroup of the Nandi Kalenjin Nilotes, the latter aver that they were the work of a northern people of peculiar language called the Sirikwa, who were later decimated by pestilence. According to the Marakwet, the Sirikwa \\"built the furrows, but they did not teach us how to build them; we only know how to keep them as they are.\\" =Engaruka= Additionally, the Iraqw's ancestors are often credited with having constructed the sprawling Engaruka complex in northern Tanzania. The modern Iraqw practice an intensive form of self-contained agriculture that bears a remarkable similarity to the ruins of stone-walled canals, dams and furrows that are found at Engaruka. Iraqw historical traditions likewise relate that their last significant migration to their present area of inhabitation occurred about two or three centuries ago after conflicts with the Barbaig sub-group of the Datog Nilotes, herders who are known to have occupied the Crater Highlands above Engaruka prior to the arrival of the Maasai. This population movement is reportedly consistent with the date of the Engaruka site's desertion, which is estimated at somewhere between 1700 and 1750. It also roughly coincides with the start of the diminishment of the Engaruka River's flow as well as those of other streams descending from the Ngorongoro highlands; water sources around which Engaruka's irrigation practices were centered. According to the Maasai Nilotes, who are the present-day occupants of Engaruka, the Iraqw also already inhabited the site when their own ancestors first entered the region during the 18th century. Distribution Iraqw homestead. In 2001, the Iraqw population was estimated to number around 462,000 individuals.Ethnologue - Tanzania Current estimates suggest the population of Iraqw people to the region of 1,000,000. Their core area of inhabitation is Iraqw‚Äôar Da/aw (or Mama Issara) in the Mbulu Highlands. It has long been known for its intensive cultivation, and referred to as an \\"island\\" within a matrix of less intensive cultivation.B√∂rjeson, L.

A large number of scientific articles on Iraqw culture can be found in a bibliography that has been compiled on the Mbulu area of Tanzania.Rekdal, O. B. (2007). . Bergen: GeGCA-NUFU. According to B√∂rjeson (2004), the Iraqw have assimilated many foreign groups into their culture. Most of the latter peoples are of Nilotic (especially Datog) and Bantu origin. Of the estimated 150 to 200 total Iraqw clans, only three are believed to be of Iraqw descent. Comprehensive anthropological analyses of the ethnic Iraqw by Ikeda et al. (1982) suggests that they share significant affinities with other Cushitic-speaking populations and \\"Caucasoids\\" generally. However, due to intermarriage with the surrounding Tanzanian populations, the Iraqw also have some morphological ties with local Bantu groups. Language The Iraqw speak the Iraqw language as mother tongue, which belongs to the South Cushitic branch of the Afro-Asiatic family. Iraqw speakers also commonly speak Swahili, the national language of Tanzania. Genetics Recent advances in genetic analyses have helped shed some light on the ethnogenesis of the Iraqw people. Genetic genealogy, although a novel tool that uses the genes of modern populations to trace their ethnic and geographic origins, has also helped clarify the possible background of the modern Iraqw. =Y DNA= A Y-chromosome study by Wood et al. (2005) tested various populations in Africa for paternal lineages, including 9 Iraqw males from Tanzania. The authors observed the E1b1b haplogroup in 56% of the studied Iraqw, which is typical of Afro-Asiatic males from North and Northeast Africa, who possess the haplogroup at high frequencies.Elizabeth T Wood, Daryn A Stover, Christopher Ehret et al., \\"Contrasting patterns of Y chromosome and mtDNA variation in Africa: evidence for sex-biased demographic processes \\", European Journal of Human Genetics (2005) 13, 867‚Äì876. (cf. Appendix A: Y Chromosome Haplotype Frequencies) The second most frequent paternal lineage among the Iraqw was Haplogroup B, which is commonly found in Nilotic populations; it was observed in 22% of Iraqw males. The third most frequently observed paternal DNA marker in the Iraqw was the E1b1a haplogroup (E-P1), which is now very common among Bantus; it was found in 11% of the Iraqw samples. IN a larger sample haplogroup T y-dna was found in 11% of Iraqw.[Hirbo et al.] =Autosomal DNA= The Iraqw's autosomal DNA has been examined in a comprehensive study by Tishkoff et al. (2009) on the genetic affiliations of various populations in Africa. According to Bayesian clustering analysis, the Iraqw generally grouped with other Afroasiatic- speaking populations inhabiting the Great Lakes region, with these lacustrine groups forming a cluster distinct from that of the Afroasiatic-speaking populations in the Horn of Africa, North Africa and the Sahara. This difference was attributed to marked genetic exchanges between the Iraqw and neighboring Nilo-Saharan and Bantu communities over the past 5,000 or so years. Also see Supplementary Data.

The museum is named for Thomas Gilcrease, an oil man and avid art collector, who began the collection. He deeded the collection, as well as the building and property, to the City of Tulsa in 1958. Since July 1, 2008, Gilcrease Museum has been managed by a public-private partnership of the City of Tulsa and the University of Tulsa.Shannon Muchmore, \\"Mutually beneficial Museum's attendance, fundraising up\\". Tulsa World, July 5, 2009. November 3, 2016. The Helmerich Center for American Research at Gilcrease Museum was added in 2014 at a cost of $14 million to provide a secure archival area where researchers can access any of the more than 100,000 books, documents, maps and unpublished materials that have been acquired by the museum. History Charles Deas - Sioux playing ball, 1843, oil on canvas Thomas Gilcrease grew up in the Creek Nation, located within present day Oklahoma. At the turn of the 20th century the federal government distributed lands held by American Indian tribes to private citizens. His tribal membership entitled him to an allotment of located south of Tulsa near Glenpool. The land subsequently became part of Oklahoma's first major oil fields, the Glenn Pool Oil Reserve, and Gilcrease proved to be an able businessman. In 1922, he founded the Gilcrease Oil Company, and in less than ten years had greatly expanded his original holdings. Thomas Gilcrease traveled extensively in Europe during the 1920s and 1930s. His visits to European museums inspired him to create his own collection. Pride in his American Indian heritage and interest in the history of the American West provided a focus for his collecting. Gilcrease purchased his first oil painting titled Rural Courtship by Daniel Ridgway Knight in 1912 for $1,500, but most of the collection was amassed after 1939. The first Gilcrease Museum opened at his oil company headquarters (at that time located in San Antonio, Texas) in 1943. Within a few years, he returned to Tulsa with his oil company and his growing collection. He opened a gallery for public viewing on his Tulsa estate in 1949. Erwin, Sarah. Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture. \\"Gilcrease Museum.\\" Gilcrease collected at a time when few people were interested in the art or history of the American West, and so his collection grew rapidly. During the early 1950s, he acquired numerous works of art, artifacts, and documents. Declining oil prices made it difficult for him to finance major purchases. Faced with a seemingly insurmountable debt, Gilcrease offered to sell his entire collection in order to keep it intact. In 1954, fearing that Gilcrease Museum would leave Tulsa, a small group of citizens organized a bond election. The voters of Tulsa approved, by a 3-to-1 margin, the bond issue that paid Gilcrease's outstanding debts. This kept the collection in the city. Thomas Gilcrease then deeded his collection to the city of Tulsa in 1955. In 1958, the Gilcrease foundation conveyed the museum buildings and grounds to the city of Tulsa. In addition, Gilcrease committed oil property revenue to Tulsa for assistance in maintaining the museum until the $2.25 million bond was fully repaid. In the years following the transfer of the collection, Thomas Gilcrease continued to fund archaeological excavations and acquire additional materials for the collection. Upon his death in 1962, he bequeathed to the museum the material he had collected during his final years. Many famous American artists have their work displayed in Gilcrease Museum's American West Gallery. Albert Bierstadt, Frederic Remington, Thomas Moran, and Joseph Henry Sharp are featured prominently. Also on display at the Gilcrease Museum are works by Charles Marion Russell, Alexandre Hogue, and John James Audubon. After his death in 1955, the widow of artist William Robinson Leigh gave his New York studio to the Gilcrease Museum. Thomas Gilcrease believed that the story of the American West could be told through art and that the history of the native Americans and his own American Indian heritage could be preserved through painting, sculpture, and other forms of art. He was a patron to a number of native American artists of his time and purchased over 500 paintings by 20th century native American artists alone. Gilcrease Museum has a long-term native American exhibition. Enduring Spirit: Native American Artistic Traditions permits the museum to showcase some of the major strengths of the permanent collection as well as provide a much more comprehensive and integrated presentation of the museum's native American art collections. Currently, the museum owns about 10,000 pieces of art, including 18 of the 22 bronze sculptures that were created by Frederic Remington. On July 1, 2008 the University of Tulsa assumed management of the museum through a public-private partnership with the City of Tulsa.Shannon Muchmore, \\"Mutually beneficial Museum's attendance, fundraising up\\". Tulsa World, July 5, 2009. Accessed November 3, 2016. Anthropology At Gilcrease Museum, the anthropology collections and the work of the department of anthropology focus on the cultural history of North, Central, and South America. The collections comprise 300,000 artifacts, covering prehistoric and historic archaeology and ethnographic materials from native American, Hispanic, pre-Columbian, and Anglo-American cultural traditions. The ethnographic and historical materials span the period from European exploration of the Americas to the current day. These diverse materials help tell the story of the many peoples and cultures that have made the history and exploration of the new world unique and complex. Especially noteworthy in the archaeological collections at Gilcrease Museum are items from the Mississippi valley region (present-day Illinois and Arkansas), the southwestern U.S. (Colorado, New Mexico, and Arizona), and ancient Mexico. Gilcrease Museum has one of the most important collections of pre-Columbian projectile points (arrow and spear heads) in North America, and has become a resource that is regularly consulted by archaeologists. The museum also has a research facility containing sliding glass display shelves for artifacts and a computer database system to help find various pieces. This facility, the Kravis Discovery Center, also has numerous \\"touchable\\" items for a hands-on experience for its visitors. Archival collection The archival collection at Gilcrease Museum contains over 100,000 books, manuscripts, documents, and maps ranging from 1494 to the present. Items of special interest are: A letter dictated and signed by Diego Columbus in 1512, the Cortez Decree of 1521, copies of the Declaration of Independence and the Articles of Confederation (signed by Benjamin Franklin), and a letter written by Thomas Jefferson dated July 1, 1776. The museum also has a substantial collection of manuscripts by Cherokee principal chief John Ross and Choctaw Chief Peter Pitchlynn. Helmerich Center The Helmerich Center for American Research at Gilcrease Museum is an archival center on the museum grounds that permits researchers to access the many rare documents housed at the museum. These items may only be used in the Reading Room, an environmentally controlled, secure area, designed to protect them against loss or damage. The documents themselves are stored in a hardened concrete structure that was designed to protect them from severe weather events like tornadoes. The secured connector passage between the Reading Room and the document storage area was inspired by the \\"Vasari Corridor\\" in Florence, Italy. The same structure that contains the Reading Room also contains the Great Hall, which is used for many purposes, such as fund raising events, conferences, and short-term gallery displays. The Center was designed by Hastings & Chivetta, completed in 2014, contains of space and cost approximately $14 million to construct.\\"Helmerich Center for American Research at Gilcrease Museum.\\" Hastings+Chivetta . 2016 Accessed November 3, 2016. Gilcrease gardens Gilcrease Museum's gardens draw thousands of visitors a year. Using the Gilcrease collections as a guide, themed gardens have been developed on twenty-three of the museum's . These gardens enhance the museum's collections by reflecting gardening styles and techniques from four time periods in the American West: Pre-Columbian, Pioneer, Colonial, Victorian, as well as a rock garden. Gilcrease is the only known art museum to have these educational and inspirational gardens on one site nestled in the Osage Hills. Special garden tours are available by appointment. Vision 2025 expansion plan Voter approval of an 0.6 percent sales tax (known as Vision 2025) on April 5, 2016, proposed to allocate $65 million for a major expansion/improvement program of Gilcrease Museum. Highlights of the program include: * Adding two new galleries - one containing to show more of the existing collection, the other containing to exhibit traveling collections; * Adding a new grand entry and great hall to accommodate large groups of visitors and to transform the appearance of the museum entrance; * Adding underground parking space; * Building an elevated restaurant;Wade, Jarrel. \\"Gilcrease Museum has big plans for Vision funds\\".

Trofense as a striker. He spent most of his professional career in Portugal, starting in 2003 with Porto. Club career Born in Santos, S√£o Paulo, Moraes arrived at only 19 to FC Porto in Portugal, from Santos FC. His career with the northern club would be marred by constant injuries‚Äì he played two Primeira Liga games in his debut season, and none whatsoever in 2005‚Äì06 and 2007‚Äì08. Moraes' most productive season at Porto came in the 2006‚Äì07 campaign, as the Dragons won the national championship for the second year running. He appeared in 18 matches and scored three goals the domestic league and the UEFA Champions League combined, notably taking part in both group stage matches against Hamburger SV and netting in the second, a 3‚Äì1 away win 1 in November 2006. Moraes spent 2004‚Äì05 on loan to Vit√≥ria de Set√∫bal, where he appeared regularly, and started 2008‚Äì09 on loan with the same team, but the second spell was soon cut short due to injury. In January 2010, with a contract running until June, he returned to Porto, trying to persuade manager Jesualdo Ferreira to add him to the squad of the four-time national champions; he did not and was loaned one more time, now to another fellow league club Rio Ave FC. In mid-February 2011, Moraes signed with Associa√ß√£o Naval 1¬∫ de Maio also in Portugal. He scored regularly during his four-month spell with the Figueira da Foz team, but it could not finally avoid top-flight relegation. In late July 2011, after an aborted transfer to Al-Ahly S.C. in Egypt, he joined another Portuguese top-tier side, U.D. Leiria, meeting the same fate at the end of the season. On 8 October 2012, Moraes moved clubs and countries again, signing a one-year contract with √öjpest FC in Hungary. In July 2015, after only 11 games combined for Gil Vicente F.C. and Associa√ß√£o Portuguesa de Desportos, he joined Varzim S.C. of the Portuguese Segunda Liga. Personal life Moraes' younger brother, J√∫nior Moraes, was also a footballer and a striker. He too represented Santos as a senior, as well as Gloria Bistri≈£a. Their father also played for that club as well as Clube de Regatas do Flamengo, whilst a sister ended her career early on due to injury. Moraes' mother won the S√£o Paulo State tennis championship.

In 1987, the Ikoma population was estimated to number 15,000. History shows that the Waikoma are closely related to the Wangoreme and Waissenye tribes with whom they are believed to have migrated to Serengeti district, leaving the Wasonjo, their other close relatives in Loliondo, Ngoronoro district of Arusha Region, behind. The four tribes lived by hunting and gathering but later adopted agriculture, such as cultivating crops (mainly finger millet, simsim, groundnuts and sorghum) and keeping livestock (sheep, cattle and goats) for their subsistence, barter trade, and customary payments such as bride price. Even after adopting agricultural practices, the Waikoma remained dependent on wild animals for their source of protein. Meat from domestic animals was eaten only during customary ceremonies such as weddings, circumcision, or initiation into adulthood. However, with the increasing awareness on the importance of the conservation of wildlife and the government policy of sharing of the revenue from tourism with the local government and communities, hunting and depending on game meat is slowly becoming history to the Waikoma. The language of the Waikoma is Kiikoma. It is a simple Bantu language, easily understood by other Bantu people living around Lake Victoria and indeed the whole of East Africa. However, intermarriages with people from other Tanzanian tribes or even non-Tanzanians is slowly but surely going to lead to the extinction of the language if deliberate efforts are not made to conserve it. The Waikoma have strived to keep pace with the economic and technological changes in the country. Most expectant mothers attend antenatal clinics and ensure that their infants receive all the mandatory vaccinations. Most of the school age children attend school with the majority of them continuing through secondary education in the ward or other secondary schools. There are many university graduates although most of them secure employment in major urban centres far from home. The average Mwikoma is politically active and participates in all socioeconomic activities in his/her village. The Ikoma find and collect honey. With help from a small bird unable to reach the abandoned honey combs the Ikoma eat and sell the honey. the small bird leads them to the honeycombs and the individual that has been led there must give a piece to the bird or else it is said the bird will never help them again.

Background Stevens was alleged to have committed an offence a few months before April 17, 1982, when the Charter came into effect. The offence was sexual intercourse by a male person with a female person under the age of fourteen years. The Criminal Code provision defining the offence specified that the accused is guilty \\"whether or not he believes that she is fourteen years of age or more\\". Counsel for the accused argued that this part of the offence contravened section 7 of the Charter, by denying a mens rea aspect to an essential element of the offence. In essence, the argument parallels that made successfully in Re BC Motor Vehicle Act (1985). Decision In a 5:3 decision, the Court found that the accused could not rely on the Charter, in challenging the Criminal Code provision under which he was charged, because he committed the offence prior to the Charter entering into force. The majority relied on R v James, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 669. Dissent Writing for the minority, in dissent, Justice Bertha Wilson argued that since the Charter had entered into effect at the time of Stevens's trial, he was entitled to its benefit. She distinguished the James case, which held that a search or seizure that took place prior to the Charter coming into force could not constitute a violation of section 8 of the Charter. Wilson wrote that in considering section 7 of the Charter, one must ask whether, at the time of the projected deprivation of the accused's right to liberty, that deprivation would be in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice or not (paragraph 20). She reasoned that since the Charter was in full force and effect at the time of the accused's trial, no issue of retrospectivity was raised. She went on to find that the Criminal Code provision contravened section 7 of the Charter by creating an absolute liability offence with the possibility of imprisonment. Wilson further found that the contravention was not saved by section 1 of the Charter. On this issue, Wilson gave extensive consideration to the majority decision of the British Columbia Court of Appeal in R v Ferguson, [1987] 6 W.W.R. 481. That decision was written by Justice Beverley McLachlin, who would later join the Supreme Court of Canada as Wilson's colleague. McLachlin had found that the denial of the mistake-of-age defence in the Criminal Code provision was justified under section 1 because it created a strong deterrent against having sexual intercourse with girls, even if they appear to have attained the statutory age. Wilson disagreed with this analysis. She argued that it ascribed an unrealistically high degree of legal sophistication to the average accused (paragraph 48). She further held that a mechanism was available which would constitute a smaller impairment on the rights of the accused: a due- diligence defence. Aftermath Two years later, in the case of R v Hess; R v Nguyen, Wilson considered the same provision, this time writing for the majority, and found it unconstitutional as a violation of section 7, not saved by section 1. Retrospectivity was not an issue in that case because the alleged offences occurred after the Charter entered into effect.

It is the centerpiece of the Crab Orchard National Wildlife Refuge. It is fed by Devils Kitchen Lake and Little Grassy Lake, which are also within the National Wildlife Refuge. Crab Orchard Lake was created when Crab Orchard Creek, a tributary of the Big Muddy River in southern Illinois, was dammed in the 1930s for purposes of recreation and flood control. The Crab Orchard National Wildlife Refuge was established August 5, 1947 following the transfer of all land previously held by the Crab Orchard Creek Project and the Illinois Ordnance Plant to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. The lake offers opportunities for boating, camping, fishing, and swimming. Two campgrounds, Blue Heron and Crab Orchard, operate on the northern side of the lake.Joe McFarland, \\"The Unique Refuge\\", Outdoor Illinois XIX:3 (March 2011), pages 14-15.

Many users of the lake live in the large nearby communities of Carbondale and Marion. Controversy Crab Orchard Lake is located in an area of Illinois known for high-sulphur coal and former coal-fired heavy industry, including the smelting and refining of heavy metals. During World War II, munitions such as TNT were produced at the Illinois Ordnance Plant north of the lake. A postwar factory, Sangamo-Weston, used PCBs extensively. Chemists have found that much of the lake and the watershed that drains into it is contaminated with lead and other toxic substances. Under a mandate from the U.S. Congress, the Crab Orchard National Wildlife Refuge is charged with the dual duties of maintaining recreational facilities and leasing lakeside land to factories.

But it only saw periodic visits during the fishing season until 1755 when settlers arrived from Acadia, Normandy, the Pays Basque, and, after the British conquest of Quebec, Jersey. In 1767, the Jersey merchants Charles Robin and Company established there a permanent fishing operation and headquarters.quebecheritageweb.com: \\"From Jersey to the Gasp√©: Charles Robin, 1743-1824, a Forgotten Father of Canada (Part 2)\\" This, together with its natural harbour, made Pasp√©biac the region's main commercial centre. The Robin and Le Boutillier installations on the barachois resembled a small town. Each company had a warehouse four or five storeys high, a general store, a wharf, a carpenter shop, a sail loft, a blacksmith shop and forge, a cooper shop for making barrels, offices, a cook-house, a boarding house for the apprentices, and numerous other buildings ‚Äì besides the large area given over to the flakes and the drying fish. Set on the hill away from the fishery there were the Robin farm buildings and a large house, known as The Park, where the General Manager lived. In 1796, the local parish was founded, and in 1832, its post office opened. In 1855, the place was incorporated as the Township Municipality of Cox, named after the geographic township that in turn was named in honour of Nicholas Cox (ca. 1724-1794), Lieutenant Governor of the Gasp√© District. As late as 1860, the ocean was the only available means of surface transportation, and there is record of an observer in 1858 writing about \\"le manque absolu de chemins\\" in the region. In 1877, this township municipality ceased to exist when it was divided into the Municipalities of Pasp√©biac and New Carlisle. In 1886, riots broke out in Paspebiac because of the bankruptcy of the firm of Charles Robin and Company,\\"ROSEMARY E. OMMER: The Truck System in Gasp√©, 1822-77\\", Acadiensis Vol. XIX, No. 1 Autumn/Automne 1989, p.111 which had resulted from the failure of the banks of Jersey. In 1922, the western part of the municipality split off to form the Municipality of Pasp√©biac-Ouest. But on 6 August 1997, Pasp√©biac-Ouest was merged back into Pasp√©biac. In 1999, it changed its status to ville (town). A triangular voyage evolved over time with the Robin company. Ships would leave Pasp√©biac laden with dry cod bound for ports in the West Indies and South America. There they would take on cargoes of rum, molasses and sugar for Europe. From Europe they returned to Pasp√©biac with manufactured goods. The market for dry fish disappeared almost completely during the 20th century; the Company processed frozen fish for a number of years, but eventually that was given up as well. There was a disastrous fire in 1964 that destroyed most of the original Robin buildings on Pasp√©biac Beach. The remaining ones on the site, which include the large Le Boutillier Bros warehouse, form the Site Historique du Banc de Pasp√©biac.

Life and career Carl Wickland (Wiklund) was born in 1861 at Liden, V√§sternorrland Province, Sweden, to Anders Wiklund and Ingrid Brita Nilsdotter, and was one of nine siblings. According to Wickland, he emigrated from Sweden to St. Paul, Minnesota, married Anna W. Anderson and moved to Chicago, graduating from Durham Medical College in 1900. Wickland's own autobiographical sketch lists accomplishments as a general practitioner of medicine, member of the Chicago Medical Society and the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and chief psychiatrist at the State Psychopathic Institute of Chicago.Wickland, Carl. (1934). The Gateway of Understanding. Los Angeles, California. Anna Wickland died on 3 March 1937, after a nine-month illness. Carl Wickland died in 1945, at the age of 84. Wing Anderson, an author of material dealing with sleep suggestion therapy for the correction of psychosomatic ills, purchased the copyrights to both of Wickland's books. Psychical researcher Wickland turned away from conventional medical psychology and toward the belief that psychiatric illnesses were the result of influence by spirits of the dead. Wickland came to believe that a large number of his patients had become possessed by what he called \\"obsessing spirits\\", and that low-voltage electric shocks could dislodge them, while his wife Anna acted as a medium to guide them to \\"progress in the spirit world\\". Spiritualists considered him an authority on \\"destructive spirits\\" and he wrote a book in 1924, Thirty Years Among the Dead, detailing his experiences as a psychical researcher. Wickland was convinced that he was in contact with a group of spirits known as the \\"Mercy Band\\" who would remove the possessors, and help them in the spirit world. Psychologist Robert A. Baker listed Wickland and Arthur Guirdham as early psychiatrists who preferred to \\"ignore the science and embrace the supernatural\\".Baker, Robert A. (1996). Hidden Memories : Voices and Visions from Within. Prometheus Books. p. 202. Wickland founded the National Psychological Institute in Los Angeles, California to study psychic phenomena. A letter published in a 1918 issue of the journal Science criticized the institute's promotion of psychic research \\"under the name of psychology\\" as an example of \\"pseudo-psychology\\", adding that \\"the use of such a name involves bad taste and delusion.\\" Publications *Thirty Years Among the Dead (1924) *The Gateway of Understanding (1934) References Category:1861 births Category:1945 deaths Category:American spiritualists Category:Parapsychologists Category:Swedish psychiatrists Category:Swedish male writers ","title":"Carl Wickland"},{"id":"6617606","text":"Rawls Hall Jerry S.

The hoax was created in protest of how the NHL's draft was carried out at the time: deliberately slowly via telephone so that the rival World Hockey Association would not know who was being selected. The NHL did not realize that no player with this name existed until much later, and in response changed Buffalo's selection to \\"invalid claim\\" in their official records. History The Sabres' general manager at the time, Punch Imlach, was reportedly fed up with the slow drafting process, conducted via telephone, which was intended to keep draft picks secret from the rival World Hockey Association. During the 1974 draft, Imlach, who in the earlier rounds had already drafted several players that would go on to great success with the team (Derek Smith in the previous round and All-Stars Lee Fogolin and Danny Gare in the first two rounds), decided to have some fun at the expense of the league and Clarence Campbell, the NHL president for the previous 28 years. He enlisted PR Director Paul Wieland to create a fictional player. Wieland wanted the player to be of Asian descent and he knew instantly what the last name would be. As a college student driving Route 16 from Buffalo to St. Bonaventure, Wieland would regularly pass the Tsujimoto store and that name just stuck in his head. In 2013, hockey blogger Ben Tsujimoto revealed that Imlach eventually called his grandfather ‚Äì Joshua Tsujimoto, a local Japanese truck farmer and Asian food store owner ‚Äì and a Sabres staffer asked for permission to use his family name without revealing the club's true intent, as well as asking what were \\"popular\\" first names in Japanese. Imlach chose to select star center Taro Tsujimoto of the fictional Tokyo Katanas of the Japan Ice Hockey League, \\"Katanas\\" being an approximation for \\"Sabres\\" in the Japanese language, both referring to types of swords. (The JIHL, although it was a real entity, had no team representing Tokyo at the time; Kokudo would not relocate to the city until 1984, whereupon it became the Seibu Prince Rabbits. The league was replaced by the current Asia League Ice Hockey in 2004. Incidentally, 32 years later, in 2006, Kokudo would provide the first real Japanese player to play in the NHL, Yutaka Fukufuji.) The NHL made the pick official, and so it was reported by media outlets, including The Hockey News. Tsujimoto's pick came at a time when the NHL was only beginning to expand its reach for players outside Canada and the United States; Scandinavian players were beginning to be drafted into the league at around the same time. Although the players of the Soviet Union, at the time an international powerhouse, were effectively off-limits, it would have not been out of the ordinary for NHL franchises to scout for new hockey talent in unusual places, which is part of the reason there were no major objections to the legitimacy of Imlach's draft pick. Imlach did not acknowledge the fake draft pick until just before the start of training camp that year; the team listed even set up a stall for Tsujimoto and listed him on their training camp roster. The NHL eventually changed the pick to \\"invalid claim\\" for its official record-keeping purposes. Campbell did not find the hoax draft pick nearly as funny as Imlach, but this was after Tsujimoto's name had appeared in several NHL publications. Tsujimoto is still listed as a fictitious entry among Sabres' draft picks in the Sabres media guide. Hockey-Reference.com lists the Sabres as having no 11th-round pick in 1974 on their list of Sabres draft picks, and skips right over the 183rd pick on their lists of 1974 selections. Among the players selected after Tsujimoto were Dave Lumley, who played nine years in the NHL and won two Stanley Cups with the Edmonton Oilers, and Stefan Persson, who was selected in the 14th round by the New York Islanders and played for all four of their Cup-winning teams. (Lumley and Persson even faced each other in the 1983 Stanley Cup Finals.) It was not until 1992 that an actual Japanese player was drafted in the NHL, when the Montreal Canadiens selected Hiroyuki Miura. Legacy Tsujimoto quickly became an inside joke for Sabres' fans and staffers.Bailey, Budd, Celebrate the Tradition: 1970‚Äì1990, Boncraft Inc., 1989, p. 40. For years after the pick, fans would chant \\"We Want Taro\\" when games at the Buffalo Memorial Auditorium became one-sided. In addition, for many years, banners would be hung from the balcony rail stating \\"Taro Says...\\" followed by a witty comment against an opponent or player for the opponent. In the summer of 2011, trading card company Panini America added Tsujimoto to its 2010‚Äì11 Score Rookies & Traded box set. The card used a picture of an unidentified Asian man playing hockey for a team wearing similar blue-and-gold colors to the Sabres. As of 2015, Andrew Kulyk, sportswriter for Buffalo-area alternative weekly Artvoice, includes short musings on the local sports scene under the heading \\"Taro Sez\\" in most of his columns. The Franchise Hockey Manager video game series contains Taro in its database, and thus he exists as a real player in the game.https://forums.ootpdevelopments.com/showthread.php?t=309754 In 2019, Weiland released the book Taro Lives about Tsujimoto's creation.https://www.wgrz.com/article/news/unknowntaro/71-ecdfb038-dfa4-40fe-9fe4-b3774533136d Fans can purchase Sabres team jerseys with the name Tsujimoto and the number 74.

The campground was run by Tom Crosslin and his life partner Rolland \\"Rollie\\" Rohm, and was home to two annual festivals, \\"HempAid\\" and \\"Roach Roast\\", which ran from 1996 through 2001. The operation ended with the burning down of all the structures on the property and the deaths of both Tom Crosslin and Rolland Rohm.  Background  Beginning in 1996, the two annual Rainbow Farm events, \\"HempAid\\" (on Memorial Day) and \\"Roach Roast\\" (on Labor Day), were part Woodstock, part union picnic. They were family-oriented affairs, with Rohm's son, Robert, wheeling his golf cart among the soft-drink stands and hemp clothing vendors and representatives from the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws. Guests included Tommy Chong of \\"Cheech and Chong\\" fame, High Times editor Steve Hager, Merle Haggard, members of Big Brother and the Holding Company, and John Sinclair, the White Panther Party jefe and MC5 manager who, in 1969, had been sentenced to 10 years in prison for marijuana possession. Most of these guests, unlike Crosslin or Rohm, could trace a lineage to radicalism of the 1960s, when they played to a more engaged audience. The legal loophole that Crosslin used to hold these gatherings without sparking mass arrests was that he, his employees and the concessionaires who paid to be a part of the festival sold absolutely no drugs. These events from 1996 through 2001 made Rainbow Farm the center of marijuana activism in Michigan. It was listed by High Times magazine as \\"fourteenth on the list of twenty-five Top Stoner Travel Spots in the world\\". Investigation and arrests Rainbow Farm was the focus of an investigation by Cass County prosecutor Scott Teter. A Rainbow Farm festival was linked to the death of a Berrien County teenager killed April 21, 2001, after his car crashed into a school bus carrying Eau Claire High School students. After a few months of unsuccessfully trying to gather evidence using undercover police officers, the investigation eventually came to a head in early May 2001, when Michigan State Police troopers served a tax-fraud warrant and found more than 200 marijuana plants. Tom and Rollie were arrested on felony manufacture and weapons charges, and Rollie's son, Robert, was taken into foster care. Crosslin was charged with felony possession of a firearm, growing marijuana and maintaining a drug house. He faced 20 years in prison and was out of jail on a $150,000 bail bond, as the state was moving to seize Rainbow Farm under civil asset forfeiture proceedings. During this time Crosslin publicly violated his bail agreement by announcing that he would throw another festival. In August 2001, Crosslin and Rohm failed to appear at their appointed court date, and set fire to a building on their property. Throughout Labor Day weekend, according to law enforcement accounts, Crosslin and Rohm systematically burned down the ten structures on their farm, shot at and hit a news helicopter filming the fires, shot at and missed a police surveillance plane, and sprayed the woods bordering the property with gunfire to keep police at bay. Crosslin and Rohm also began procuring assault rifles and claiming that the farm had been mined and booby-trapped. September 2001 The standoff began when deputies went to the farm after neighbors said Crosslin was burning buildings on his property. Believing they were outgunned, the local authorities called in the FBI. The state police and FBI agents surrounded Crosslin's house on August 31; with snipers in the woods watching the house. Crosslin and Rohm fired several times at the police, striking an armored vehicle. They also fired on and struck the rear stabilizer of a local news helicopter containing two civilians. On September 3, Crosslin walked into the woods on his farm, and while walking back he spotted an FBI agent lying on the ground. Crosslin raised his rifle and was shot in the forehead and died instantly. The autopsy report said Crosslin was shot five times in the head, and three times in the torso. That morning, at 3:45 a.m., Rohm asked that his son be brought to see him and told police that if he was, he would surrender at 7 a.m.. Shortly after 6 a.m., a fire was reported at the Rainbow Farm residence. While walking outside the house Rohm was shot dead by another police marksman. A third man, Brandon J. Peoples, suffered minor injuries when Crosslin was shot and was questioned by authorities.  Timeline  * 1993: Tom Crosslin buys the property for Rainbow Farm in Vandalia, Michigan.

It is a vehicle (usually a bus or a large van) equipped with everything necessary for a blood donation procedure. Blood drives involving bloodmobiles usually happen in public places such as colleges and churches. Often large employers will sponsor mobile blood drives and allow employees a few hours off of work to donate blood. In addition, many high schools hold annual blood drives which allow students aged 16 and over to donate blood with a signed permission form. Typically students are offered snacks, T-shirts, or time out of class as an incentive, as well as positive peer pressure. How to organise a blood drive The first step in organising any blood drive is to contact the nearest blood bank or blood donation centre. A blood drive representative is assigned to help the person organising the drive. The representative assesses whether the organising company meets the requirements for the drive to proceed. The representative and organiser then plan the actual drive together, establishing mutual goals based on the size of the group and how many people are expected to donate. How a bloodmobile worked in the 1950s In the 1950s the American Red Cross ran mobile blood units that would pop up all over the place, giving people a community-based location at which to donate. These mobile units were very efficient, with a large Red Cross truck manned by two men, arriving at an empty location and setting up for the first donation, which would be taken two hours later. The truck would be loaded with at least ten beds, mattresses, dozens of screens and chairs, waste receptacles, tables, stools, huge refrigerated boxes, canvas bags of ice, coffee urns, orange juice, canteen equipment, hundreds of blood bottles, boxes of sterile supplies, bottles of solution, literature and record forms, oxygen tanks, and sheets. The men would have this unloaded and set up on site in less than an hour. Once setup was complete, nurses, volunteers and doctors arrived. There were normally six nurses and 15 volunteers. The nurses did their preliminary tasks while the volunteers split off into groups. One group unpacked and set up the reception area. Another group set up the canteen and prepared food for after donations. The third group set up the blood bottle table where the blood would be tagged, numbered, and recorded. When the site opened, donors would enter via the reception area to answer questionnaires which determined whether they were eligible to donate. Once accepted, a donor was taken through to the nurse, who would take blood pressure and perform other tests. The donor then went to the next nurse, who took the blood. If the donor had a reaction while donating, they went to the recovery room where they went under the care of the doctor until they had fully recovered. If the donor did not have a reaction, they would go to the canteen for refreshments. In the 1950s, mobile blood units like this would collect from 200 donors in six hours.

Set in the tiny French village of Janvilliers in 1936. Together with Birdsong and Charlotte Gray, it makes up Faulks' France Trilogy. The character Charles Hartmann is common to all three books. Plot introduction An unsigned prologue introduces the reader to 1930s France and sets-up the fiction that the novel tells the true story behind an actual newspaper report of the time. This is imagined as being a passionate adulterous love-affair between the book's two central characters with the nation's unstable political scene as its backdrop. The politics are rendered to us through the characters' every day conversation- they rely on newspapers for information- which means that the history lesson aspect of the book arises organically in the narrative. Written in the third person using a conventional omniscient narrator, the novel airs the internal motivations and viewpoints of various characters. The narrative tone is at times ironic; the author uses unfussy language to tell the story with economy. The vast majority of the scenes in the novel are set indoors, which gives it a domestic and claustrophobic feel. There are no descriptions of physical violence, but there is trauma and angst. The character of Mattlin is a truly vicious villain, while the mood is down-beat -- in fact, mock-Gothic in the Poe-inspired sub-plot involving the renovation of the Manor House. The book is shot through with mordant wit, but there are also lighter moments of tenderness and near-slapstick. On its publication, The Girl at the Lion d'Or was lauded in reviews for Faulks' ability to evoke a sense of time and place and for his adroitness in creating engaging characters. Plot summary A wet and dark winter night sees young and beautiful Anne Louvert arrive in Janvilliers from Paris to take up a lowly position at the village inn, the Lion d'Or. She gets to know the staff- the formidable Madame Concierge, the drunken Cook, the sex-starved Porter- and to meet the mysterious Patron. Then there are the customers: the evil Mattlin and the sensitive Hartmann most prominent among them. A generation older than she, the cultured, rich and married Charles Hartmann begins an affair with Anne. She reveals her secrets, her fears and her hopes to him trusting in their mutual love. His wife, Christine, knows him better, and in the end, its no real contest for her to keep her husband and see off her latest rival. Although Faulks writes the love story with commitment, the nature of the novel determines that it can only end badly for Anne. An historical novel in which history is treated seriously, The Girl at the Lion d'Or is tragic drama and its real subject is France herself. A happy fairy-tale ending would be incongruous: it did not happen for the French Third Republic; therefore, it could not happen for Anne. Anne's childhood has been blighted by the First World War. Her father was shot on a charge of mutiny while serving in the trenches at Verdun, and her mother, harassed and victimised because of his fate, driven to suicide. Anne endured a wandering, hand-to-mouth existence with her uncle Louvert, whose name she adopts. Louvert, vainglorious and empty dispenser of fine sounding phrases- \\"Courage is the only thing that counts\\"The Girl at the Lion d'Or Pp.115-, joined a right wing revolutionary organisation with the aim of \\"making France great again\\"The Girl at the Lion d'Or, Pp 158 but deserted both Anne and France for a new life in America. Anne later invests her emotions in Hartmann and although devastated by his rejection, she does not allow it to destroy her. She intuitively turns away from suicide and the last line of the novel leads us to believe that she will, though there will be dark days ahead, overcome her situation. The battle of Verdun and the French army mutinies a year later were momentous events for the French nation. That the battle and a charge of mutiny played such a major part in Anne's personal history suggests a metaphorical link between her and France. The fact that the prologue to the narrative dedicates the story to Anne, \\"an unknown girl\\"The Girl at the Lion d'Or, Prologue rather than the \\"important public\\" figures of the time also indicates that the character represents something larger than an individual. The use of the adjective \\"unknown\\", in the context of this novel, is loaded with meaning, as it evokes the Unknown Soldier. By making Anne a homeless, friendless, orphaned young woman, Faulks is pushing the limits of melodrama in his wish to create a character who is the opposite of those in the male-dominated world of political power. She is the victim of political decisions and human spite but does not embrace victimhood. Instead she embodies most of the virtues and a certain defiance. More importantly she is vital: she makes decisions and acts on them. The polemic thrust of the book, backed-up by references to newspaper stories of political crises and scandal at home and mounting threat of war from abroad, is that the period's political leaders were, at best, inert. The setting of the story is also much removed from the centre of power and influence in the political sense if not geographically. In fact the author is shy of saying where in France the town of Janvilliers is. The descriptions of the seasons in the book and that Hartmann walks on a beach near his house from which \\"the sea has disappeared\\"The Girl at the Lion d'Or Pp.227 puts it somewhere on the north coast. Imprecise as this is, it rules out the real Janvilliers being the location though its name may have been used because of that town's proximity to Verdun. Geographical imprecision serves the function of making the fictional Janvilliers a French \\"everytown\\" where the attitudes and experiences of its inhabitants typify those of towns throughout France of the period. Choosing 'Lion d'Or', a common and therefore typical name for French inns, as the name of the town hotel is meant to strengthen the idea of this representational aspect of Janvilliers. A war monument in the town centre commemorating the dead of the First World War could be found in any town in the country. Similarly, M. Bouin, a woman bereaved of her menfolk by the war and finding solace in religion, would be a familiar character in 1930's France. M. le Patron typifies the defeatist mindset among many of the time while the odious Mattlin is the town's future fifth columnist and collaborator. Hartmann is the ineffectual liberal. His failure to confront Mattlin, whose slanders are undermining Hartmann's reputation just as surely as the builder hired to renovate his house undermines its foundations, can be read as a metaphor of the centre-left government's failure to confront fascism either at home or abroad.

The cry, especially the kind expressed by Hartmann on page 234- He turned and flung his arms around a wooden pillar in the hall, sobbing tearlessly is something of a motif in Faulks' novels. The same kind of helpless, despairing cry turns up in Birdsong (twice) and also in On Green Dolphin Street. He abandons Anne for America when she refused to be his mistress. A member of a Crypto-Nazi French league, he is depicted mockingly in the text.

It promoted Christian Democratic ideals. History Shortly after the formation of the National Independence Party in 1958, Member of the Belize House of Representatives Enrique Depaz claimed at a meeting held on 19 August that there was no opposition to the ruling People's United Party (PUP), who had just won elections in March 1957. He proposed that a third party was necessary to provide real representation to Belizeans. His proposal was accepted and the DALP was formed under leader Nicholas Pollard. The party aimed to achieve self-government and promote social, economic and political development and was against entering groupings such as the Federation of the West Indies or any proposed affiliation with Guatemala and/or the rest of Central America. By October 1960, the party felt it was time to reorganise. Pollard was demoted to Deputy Leader and replaced by MP Denbigh Jeffery. Joining them were Chairman Lionel Francis (previously of the NP), Secretary Mervyn Hulse and assistant Ernest Cain, Treasurer Clare Gill and National Organizer Robert Taylor. The party contested its first elections in 1961, but none of the eleven candidates it fielded won a seat. As a result the party fizzled and most of its members switched over to the National Independence Party. The party was briefly revived prior to the 1984 elections by Theodore Aranda to promote his new party based in Dangriga. However, it received only 708 votes (1.5%) and failed to win a seat.Nohlen, D (2005) Elections in the Americas: A data handbook, Volume I, pp105-106 ( correction of name Denbigh Jeffrey to Denbigh Jeffery) References Category:Political parties established in 1958 Category:Defunct political parties in Belize Category:Political parties disestablished in 1961 Category:Christian political parties Category:1958 establishments in British Honduras ","title":"Christian Democratic Party (Belize)"},{"id":"6617753","text":"Dr. Azzam Tamimi, November 2008.

After high school, Tamimi moved to London to attend college. In 1979, he received a Bachelor of Science degree in Combined Sciences from the University of Sunderland and a PhD in Political Theory from the University of Westminster in 1998. Reforming Finsbury Park Mosque In 2005, Tamimi led a group of trustees in reforming the Finsbury Park Mosque, which was previously under the control of Abu Hamza al-Masri. The reformation of the mosque has widely been seen as successful.

He has stated that \\"peace may still be achieved by talking about how to co-exist.\\"The unrealistic terms being imposed upon Hamas are no basis for talks, The Guardian, 5 November 2007. In elaboration, he has said that \\"Hamas would only agree to a negotiated settlement based on the idea of a hudna (longterm ceasefire).

The school was founded by the Sisters of Notre Dame de Sion in 1912. The all-girls high school campus is located in South Kansas City, and the co-educational grade school campus is located in the Hyde Park neighborhood. The two campuses are about 10 miles apart. History =Hyde Park Pre-K Through 8th Grade (Co-ed)= In 1892, the Congregation arrived in the United States when four Sisters of Sion began educating young children in Auburn and Lewiston, Maine. By 1904, the number of Sisters had grown to sixty. In 1907, the Sisters transferred to Marshall, Missouri, where they taught at Sion Academy until 1925. In 1912, Bishop Thomas Francis Lillis invited seven Sisters to Kansas City. Two taught in the Annunciation School. The others began a French kindergarten and gave private sewing, music and French lessons, which grew into the Notre Dame de Sion School. For decades to follow, the Sisters continued managing and growing the institution, building their first campus in Kansas City‚Äôs historic Hyde Park. In 1953, Bobby Greenlease was kidnapped from the Hyde Park school by a woman claiming to be his aunt. The $600,000 ransom paid by his family was the largest paid to that point, although Greenlease had been killed before the ransom was paid. The original campus at 3823 Locust is now co-ed and includes PreK Montessori, and kindergarten through middle school. =South Kansas City All Girl High School= In 1962, the high school moved to south Kansas City at 10631 Wornall Rd. Six years later the Sisters invited lay members to serve on the school's Board of Trustees, and in 1990 the ownership of the school was transferred to the Board. Sion Today Notre Dame de Sion is now known city- wide as a rigorous college preparatory school. It is still located in the South Kansas City campus, and girls from all over the Kansas City metro travel to come to Sion. Sion has many musical opportunities including a musical and plays. It also has a drum line and choir. Sion has many athletic achievements, including many wins from the dance team, who has won 10th overall in the nation in 2019 and has won 1st place in the state of Missouri for ten consecutive years. Other sports include basketball, softball, cheerleading, swim, dive, soccer, volleyball, field hockey, lacrosse, cross-country, and track. Sion also has many opportunities to travel abroad to Australia, Costa Rica, and France, to their sister schools. Governance Today, Notre Dame de Sion in Kansas City is one of seventeen Sion schools worldwide, sustained by the charism of the Sisters. Notre Dame de Sion in Kansas City is affiliated with the Roman Catholic Diocese of Kansas City-St. Joseph as well as the Congregation of the Sisters of Notre Dame de Sion. The school is owned by a lay corporation and governed by a board of trustees.http://ndsion.edu/mission/history-and-traditions.cfml Notable alumnae *Heidi Gardner- Saturday Night Live actress *Megan Barry - Mayor of Nashville *Maggie Williams - Former Chief of Staff for Hillary Clinton was one of the early African-American graduates in the 1970's External links * References Category:High schools in Kansas City, Missouri Category:Catholic secondary schools in Missouri Category:Educational institutions established in 1912 Category:Girls' schools in Missouri Category:Private middle schools in Missouri Category:1912 establishments in Missouri Category:Roman Catholic Diocese of Kansas City‚ÄìSaint Joseph Category:Preparatory schools in Missouri ","title":"Notre Dame de Sion School, Kansas City"},{"id":"6617845","text":"The Grand Massif is a ski resort located in Haute-Savoie department, France. History The Grand Massif area was born in 1980 by the combination of the Massif (Les Carroz, Morillon, Samo√´ns, Vernant and Sixt Fer √† Cheval) and the Flaine bowl resort; the first combined ski passes were sold for the 1981 season. The area provides a tremendous variety of on piste runs, off piste and between piste skiing, scenery and height, providing good skiing in all types of weather and conditions. The area consists of a ridgeline running between the valleys of the River Arve (coming down from Chamonix), and the River Giffre (sourced in the National Park area above Sixt), with spurs running off the ridgeline to form the Flaine bowl and the high valleys and ridges of the Massif. In the best snow conditions it is possible to ski from the Tete des Saix (2120m) down to Morillon village at 700m on a choice of runs, and from the top of Flaine (2480m) down to Sixt at 800m on the classic picturesque 14 km Cascades run. Resort development The resort of les Carroz (1140 ‚Äì 2500 metres) is administered by the commune of Ar√¢ches-La Frasse and the resort of Flaine (1600 ‚Äì 2500 metres) has been jointly managed by the commune and by Magland, a small town situated in the valley. Compagnie des Alpes (\\"CDA\\"), the world's largest ski operator, acquired four resorts in the Grand Massif (Flaine, Samo√´ns, Morillon and Sixt) in mid-December 1997, and in 1998 formed a global alliance with Canadian developer Intrawest. For Flaine this means the addition of 2,700 beds (with a further 2,000 in a second phase) and investments in new lifts, services and infrastructure. Les Carroz remains independent of the Flaine resort management. Ski season dates For the 2019‚Äì2020 season, all Grand Massif resorts are open from Saturday, December 15th 2019 to Sunday, April 12th 2020. Sixt is permanently closed as of December 2018 http://winter.grand- massif.com/opening-dates 2018-2020 development As of 2018, Sixt has been permanently closed due to lack of snow and lack of profitability to replace the three aging 50 year old lifts. The resort announced for a new six seat chairlift called Coulouvrier in 2018. This would link 1100m to 2100m, add 4 new pistes, as well as replace the aging 40 year old lifts: Gouilles De Rouge & Lanche. The lift was completed for the 2018 - 2019 ski season. In 2019, the resort has announced for a new 10 seat gondola to replace the current Vercland lift which was built over 45 years ago. The lift is scheduled for the 2020 - 2021 ski season. Les Carroz Until the 1930s the village of Les Carroz was a simple farming hamlet with just a few houses. At 1100m altitude, it sits on a large sunny plateau overlooking the Arve Valley south east of the town of Cluses, on the road to Flaine. The village is part of the commune of Ar√¢ches- La Frasse. Whilst the busy periods are during the ski season (mid December to third week of April) and during the French summer holidays (July and August), it has a permanent population and is open all year round. Classic cascades run This run goes across high mountain, down through the forests and past the cascade waterfalls to Sixt; in good weather and snow conditions it is considered to be a special day trip for those that enjoy the scenery and tranquility of the mountains. Good access to Cascades is from the top of the long Gers drag lift, but to reach this the black Styx run must be skied first; Styx is open when avalanche conditions permit, but is variable in condition (sometimes pisted, sometimes not). Otherwise one can reach Cascades via the blue piste off the top of Flaine, but there is some poling to do. At the bottom at Sixt Fer √† Cheval, a bus meets skiers to take them back to the cabin lift at Samo√´ns. There are some quiet and surprisingly interesting runs in Sixt (accessible via the Cascades drag-lift), but as of 2018, is only accessible via ski-touring as the three 1970 chairlifts were permanently closed due to aging status and lack of profitability to replace them. But there are still three drag lifts in operation.

An ordinary hang glider is used for its wing and control frame, and the pilot can foot-launch from a hill or from flat ground, needing a length of about a football field to get airborne, or much less if there is an oncoming breeze and no obstacles.  History  = Adding propulsion = While powered microlights (ultralights) developed from hang gliding in the late 1970s, they were also a return to the type of low-speed aircraft that were common in the earlier years of aviation, but which were superseded as both civil and military aircraft pursued more speed.In 1898 Augustus Moore Herring adapted a compressed air engine to a weight-shift biplane. Images: For a second time in aviation history, during the 1970s, motorization of simple gliders, especially those portable and foot-launched, became the goal of many inventors and gradually, small wing-mounted power packs were adapted. These early experiments went largely unrecorded, even in log books, let alone the press, because the pioneers were uncomfortably aware that the addition of an engine made the craft liable to registration, airworthiness legislation, and the pilot liable to expensive licensing and probably, insurance. Inventors from Australia, France and England produced several successful microlight motor gliders in the early 1970s French aviation historians on FLPHG and very few were portable wings. Don Mitchell Surprisingly, what really launched the powered ultralight aviation movement in the United States was not the Rogallo flexible wing but a whole series of rigid-wing motorized hang gliders.British Microlight Aircraft Association, History of Microlighting The Icarus V flying wing appeared with its tip rudders and swept-back style wing was used as a base for some powered experiments. Differently, a rigid biplane designed also by teenager Taras Kiceniuk Jr., the Icarus II was a foundation for a modification in Larry Mauro's UFM Easy Riser biplaneHang glider : EASY RISER (Larry Mauro) that started to sell in large numbers; Larry Mauro would power his tail-less biplane; one version was solar powered, called the Solar Riser. Hang gliding record holder Don MitchellIn April 1946 Mitchell completed construction of his 'Flying Wing' (not the Mitchell Wing hang glider which was developed in 1975). The American FAA issued an Experimental Airworthiness number for it. The wing was flown as a glider by Mitchell, Bolwus and Paul Tuntland. Then Mitchell mounted a Nelson 2-cycle engine on it and flew it as a powered glider with wheels for landing gear. fitted his Mitchell Wing B-10 with a motor,In the early 1940s Don Mitchell first became involved with flying wing glider design and construction. But World War II interrupted his research and experiments. Then in 1974, with the advent of hang glider mania, the Mitchell Wing resurfaced. It was at that time Dr. Howard Long took an interest in the half-forgotten project and asked Mitchell to make him a flying wing hang glider. The result was the foot-launched Mitchell Wing, controllable by a 'joystick'. The Mitchell Wing astounded the world of hang gliding. George Worthington, holder of eight world records in hang gliding and author of the book In Search of World Records, wrote in the book...\\"I predict that the Mitchell Wing will be the highest performance foot-launched hang glider we'll see for a long time.\\" He was right, and it was from this preliminary design that Mitchell developed his later powered models: The Mitchell Wing B-10 and Mitchell U-2 Superwing. though the pilot still had to use their legs as undercarriage, an arrangement which persisted until he designed the B-10 Mitchell Wing.Don Mitchell - U.S. Pacific , B-10 Photos: Barry Palmer In 1963, and during his free time, aeronautical engineer Barry Palmer built and experimented with a foot-launched powered hang glider at Bloomfield, Connecticut. It was powered by a West Bend engine and mounted on top of a Rogallo-type flexible wing hang glider; the propeller was in diameter and was made of balsa wood, covered with fiberglass and mounted in pusher configuration. However, the engine was quite underpowered and the craft could not achieve flight.Interview with Gerard Farell on Jan. 23-24, 2007. \\"Foot launched powered Para-wing around 1963, West Bend driving a dia. glass over balsa propeller. Main structure is 6061-T6 aluminum tubing, 4 mil polyethylene. The craft was not particularly portable, the wind was always coming down the slight slope in Bloomfield, CT, and the project was terminated as I was re-engineering it with a bigger engine and as I got a job offer to move to Miami and design, build and fly the wheeled wings (trikes).\\" It is now estimated that a modern flexible Rogallo wing hang glider requires at least at the prop shaft and about 45 lbf (200 N) of thrust just to maintain level flight. During 1967, Barry Palmer built what is likely the first weight-shift powered trike aircraft.Recorded by the FAA as: Palmer Parawing D-6, serial 1A, N7144, was registered on 4/24/1967. No limitations were noted. John Moody John Moody's powered Icarus II in Southeastern Wisconsin Aviation MuseumThe Southeastern Wisconsin Aviation Museum On March 15, 1975, John Moody successfully added a West Bend engine with a 71 cm (28 in) propeller to an UFM Easy Riser biplane hang glider designed by Larry Mauro. Moody opened the throttle and ran until he lifted from the frozen surface of a lake west of Racine, Wisconsin, and he flew for 30 minutes.

Gerry Breen - London to Paris in FLPHG (August 25, 1979) * On 7 May 1979, British pilot Gerry Breen set a new distance record for FLPHG of from Wales to Norwich, a non-stop world distance record that still stands today; using a Soarmaster, the flight took about 4 hours with a tailwind of about and reportedly consumed of fuel.Interview with Gerard Farell on November 2006. Three months later, on August 25 through 28, inspired by the film \\"Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines\\" and sponsored by British Airways, Breen flew his powered hang glider from London to Paris: Wishing to use a British made aircraft, Gerry Breen and Steve Hunt set about building with their version of the powered Soarmaster, but had no clutch. The unit, including glider, was considerably heavier than the Soarmaster and Olympus glider combination but the wing was much more robust. The hang glider was a Hiway Super Scorpion with a McCulloch 125 cc engine mounted on the keel just forward of the hang strap.This powered hang glider, registered G-BGNL, is now held by the British Hang Gliding Museum. The journey was plagued with mechanical failures but Breen overcame them and completed the trip.Despite this achievement, Breen and Hunt recognized the deficiencies of the keel mounted engine and when Breen saw a picture of Roland Magallon's trike in the French hang gliding magazine Vol Libre, he mentioned that the days of the Soarmaster 'were numbered.' * In July 2002, Italian hang gliding champion and conservationist, Angelo d'Arrigo, guided a flock of 10 endangered western Siberian cranes, bred in captivity, with an Icaro hang glider equipped with an NRG powered harness from the Arctic circle in Siberia, across Kazakhstan to the shores of the Caspian Sea in Iran, avoiding Afghanistan and Pakistan where they fall victim to the abundant guns. For the most part, he relied on the sun and wind for propulsion in order to teach the young cranes to soar long distances. This $250,000 USD experiment lasted for six months and finished in winter 2002.Interview with Angelo d'ArrigoSiberian Crane Flyway coordination Patrick Laverty - altitude world record: , U.K., May 24, 2009 * On May 24, 2009, Irish pilot Patrick Laverty broke the foot-launched powered hang glider altitude world record. He used an Aeros Discus 15 hang glider coupled to a supine custom-made harness equipped with a 29 hp ROS 125 engine with the Supa-Tuna tuning lights system on a WB32 carburettor. Takeoff was at sea level and he flew to an altitude of ASL over Talybont, Ceredigion, Wales, UK.The altitude was recorded by a digital altimeter, a GPS and the flight was filmed as well; Video: He carried oxygen and 10 litres of fuel, per U.K. regulations; his variometer indicated 30 to 50fpm climb rate at the time fuel ran out. Systems Currently, there are two harness configurations: prone (face down) and sitting. Both configurations allow the pilot to takeoff and land on their feet. Foot-launched powered hang glider (FLPHG) harnesses are built around a light metal frame with the engine and propeller mounted on the rear in a pusher configuration. Current powered harnesses weigh 22‚Äì32 kg (50-70 lb) not including the safety parachute and fuel, and fold neatly into a long harness bag with a handle. Most powered harnesses in production are equipped with the Radne Raket 120 two stroke engine which is based on Husqvarna XP3120 chainsaw parts. It has a displacement of and produces about at 8900 RPM if equipped with a tuned exhaust; when coupled to a 1:3.5 belt- driven reduction drive and a 52\\" x 22\\" propeller, it produces about 100 lbf (440 N) of static thrust. For heavy pilots or pilots operating from higher than MSL fields, a powered harness equipped with an engine is recommended.18 hp Harnesses such as the 'X1' or 'Wasp Venom' equipped with the Vittorazi EVO 100 cc for about 130 lbf (580 N) thrust at MSL  Electric motors  * Richard Kruger-Sprengel (Helix Propeller) and German designer Werner Eck, have produced at least two electric powered paraglider (EPPG) prototypes,Werner Eck, designer of an Electric PGG =Timeline for electric-powered foot- launched gliders= * 1979 April 29: at Flabob Airport, California, Larry Mauro flew the Solar Riser with an electric motor powered by storage batteries charged from the sun.

Historical Papers and Addresses of the Lancaster County Historical Society, Volume 2, 1897, page 221 His father was Frederic de Peyster, a wealthy New York City lawyer, investor, and philanthropist. He was a first cousin of Maj. Gen. Philip Kearny.Allaben, p. 18 His great great grandfather was Abraham de Peyster, an early Mayor of New York City, whose brother was Johannes de Peyster, also Mayor. His grandfather was a nephew of Arent DePeyster. He studied law at Columbia University, although he did not graduate on account of his poor health.Allaben, p. 180 He had become an invalid at a young age due to a heart affliction he developed during service as a volunteer fireman.Randolph, p. 85 De Peyster was heavily involved as a volunteer firefighter with the No. 5 Hose Carriage during his collegiate years, including a major fire in 1836, leading to his health problems.Allaben, p. 178 Despite these physical difficulties, he was described by some as feisty, and even dictatorial.Philip, Cynthia Owen.

He later received the degree of M.A. from Columbia College, LL.D. from Nebraska College, and Ph.D. by Franklin & Marshall College. He was one of the organizers of the New York City Police Department and Fire Department.Allaben, p. 185 Reforms he advocated through publications which were eventually implemented nationwide included a paid Fire Department, and Steam Fire Engines, and New York City was the first in the nation to adopt such measures.Allaben, p. 290 He spent his entire career in the New York State Militia, being promoted to brigadier general in 1851. He served as state Judge Advocate General and eventually Adjutant General, before resigning over a conflict with Governor Myron Clark in 1855. He traveled through Europe extensively as a military observer, and implemented many reforms that modernized the militia for the upcoming conflict.Allaben, p. 267 American Civil War Spencer repeating rifles, men of Company K, 148th Pennsylvania Volunteers, advance in skirmish line and capture a fort garrisoned by the 46th Virginia Infantry during the Siege of Petersburg, Virginia.Ray, Fred. Forgotten Heroes of the Skirmish Line: Jerry Z. Brown, November 25, 2006. Retrieved on July 28, 2007. Already a brigadier general of the state militia at the onset of the Civil War, he met with what he perceived (and declared) to be prejudiced resistance from Abraham Lincoln when he attempted to raise regiments for the Union Army.Randolph, p. 86 In 1861, de Peyster traveled to Washington, D.C., to solicit a commission as a brigadier general of the Regular Army and offered to raise two regiments of artillery, which he felt best suited his expertise and physical condition.Allaben, p. 319 He was met with little interest after New York had already filled its national recruitment quota of 75,000 men.Allaben, p. 320 Each of his three sons served in the conflict in the Union Army. The eldest, John Watts de Peyster Jr., performed duty as an aide-de-camp and artillery commander with the Army of the Potomac and mustered out as a brevet brigadier general; Frederic de Peyster III, was a Colonel and surgeon; while the youngest, Johnston de Peyster, was a second lieutenant in charge of a battery of artillery credited with hoisting the first Union flag over the Confederate capitol of Richmond, Virginia, after its fall.Shepley, George. Incidents in the Capture of Richmond. Atlantic Monthly, July 1880.Lamb, 1904 The career militia officer had always suffered from poor health, and turned down a commission as a colonel of cavalry offered to him by New York Senator Ira Harris in June 1863 on behalf of Generals Joseph Hooker and Alfred Pleasonton, who may have had an eye towards de Peyster's social connections.Alfred Pleasonton to Brig.Gen. John Farnsworth, June 23, 1863, Alfred Pleasonton Papers, Manuscripts Division, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. Other notable figures with limited field experience who were promoted to brigadier general by Pleasonton at that time were Elon J. Farnsworth, son of a Congressman, Wesley Merritt, and George Armstrong Custer.Henry C. Parsons, \\"Farnsworth's Charge and Death\\", included in Robert U. Johnson and C.C. Buel, eds., Battles and Leaders of the Civil War, 4 vols. (New York, 1884-1888), 3:395. Hard, pp. 76-77. His treatise New American Tactics was a series of articles published in The Army and Navy Journal that advocated making the skirmish line the new line of battle, which was considered revolutionary at the time.Randolph, p. 87 These contributions were translated and copied into foreign military journals, including Correard's renowned Biographie des c√©l√©brit√©s militaires des arm√©es de terre et de mer. Such tactics were put into practice by generals including John Buford and were later adopted worldwide. He was appointed a brevet major general in the New York Militia, April 9, 1866, by a special act of the state legislature.Randolph, p. 86-87 His elevation to major general was the first such honor bestowed by the State of New York, or any other State in the Union.Allaben, p. 323 He was a close friend of Maj. Gen. Daniel Sickles, commander of the Union III Corps. General de Peyster wrote biographies of III Corps Generals Andrew A. Humphreys and Gershom Mott during the war, and wrote highly of Buford's celebrated usage of light cavalry. After the Civil War, de Peyster was elected as a 3rd Class Companion of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States in recognition of his efforts to support the Union during the war. Postwar career The Tivoli firehouse, today the village hall General de Peyster was known as the largest developer in the village of Tivoli, New York, where he resided at his family home. In 1892 he replaced a wooden Methodist church with a brick structure that stands today. He also refurbished an old school into an industrial school for girls. An authority on fire fighting, in 1895 de Peyster erected a huge state-of-the-art brick building for the local department. A portrait of him resides there in present day, and it was used as a firehouse until 1986. The high Victorian structure also contained a courtroom, a jail and a large meeting room for the local government. The General eventually had a conflict with the village Mayor (his own son, Johnston de Peyster), and de Peyster barred him from entering the building. The village government was forced to move to another building and remained there until the Firehouse was restored in 1994, returning the local government to de Peyster's building. His writing strongly advocated Dan Sickles and his role at the Battle of Gettysburg.Randolph, p. 88 Some of his works including detailing Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker's influences on the Army of the Potomac leading up to the battle, both positive and negative. He also issued a damning portrayal of the performance of the Union XI Corps at the Battle of Chancellorsville.Johnson, Claudia Durst. Understanding the Red Badge of Courage: A Student Casebook to Issues, Sources, and Historical Documents. Greenwood Press: Westport, CT, 1998. p 79. His writing also spoke of the brilliant accomplishments of Maj. Gen. George H. Thomas and led to his modern consideration as one of the finest commanders of the war.Van Horne, p. 343-344 In the New York Times and scholarly journals, he correctly predicted the Franco-Austrian War in 1866 and the Franco-Prussian War of 1870.United States Government Printing Office. United States Congressional Serial Set, pp 216-227. U.S. G.P.O.: Washington, D.C., 1890. He made significant contributions to historical journal publications under the pseudonym \\"Anchor\\" which extolled the services of Sickles and Buford, and in separate publications praised the men of the New York City Fire Department. General de Peyster in 1863 De Peyster wrote extensive military histories about the Battle of Saratoga and in 1887 donated a memorial called the Boot Monument, which commemorates Benedict Arnold's heroic wounding at the battle (although Arnold is not mentioned by name and the memorial only depicts his boot). In 1905, De Peyster purchased first baronial mansion of Sir William Johnson, known since 1755 as Fort Johnson, and donated it to the Montgomery County Historical Society, of Amsterdam, New York.Reid, W. Max. The Story of Old Fort Johnson . The Knickerbocker Press: New York and London, 1906. In 1901, he donated several thousand books and maps to the Smithsonian Institution, along with a Moorish Yataghan he collected on his travels in 1851. De Peyster's biographer devotes six chapters to his benefactions, but does not mention his ethnological collections.Allaben, p. 211-258 Another philanthropic contribution included building the first library at Franklin & Marshall College, and donating one of the largest and most distinct rare book collections about European military history, the 1,890 volume Watts de Peyster: Napoleon Buonaparte.Dubbs, Joseph Henry. History of Franklin and Marshall College. Lancaster: Franklin and Marshall College Alumni Association, 1903.

As per the architect I. M. Pei's specifications, the museum is built on an island off an artificial projecting peninsula near the traditional dhow harbor. A purpose-built park surrounds the edifice on the eastern and southern facades while two bridges connect the southern front facade of the property with the main peninsula that holds the park. The western and northern facades are marked by the harbor showcasing the Qatari seafaring past. Facilities The museum hosts the restaurant IDAM led by the head chef Alain Ducasse. The restaurant is inspired by French Mediterranean cuisine. IDAM also offers master classes in cooking artisanal bread and raw foods. The museum has a park, workshops for schools and the general public,, and a library that provides information about Islamic Arts in both English and Arabic. The library also has nine study rooms.  Architecture  The museum is influenced by ancient Islamic architecture yet has a uniquely modern design involving geometric patterns. It is the first of its kind to feature over 14 centuries of Islamic art in the Arab States of the Persian Gulf. Occupying an area of , the museum is on an artificial peninsula overlooking the south end of Doha Bay. Construction of the building was done by a Turkish company, Baytur Construction, in 2006. The interior gallery spaces were designed by a team of Wilmotte Associates. The museum was opened on November 22, 2008 by the then- emir of Qatar, Sheikh Hamad. It opened to the general public on December 8, 2008. * * At 91 years of age, the museum's architect, I. M. Pei had to be coaxed out of retirement to undertake this enterprise. He traveled throughout the Muslim world on a six-month quest to learn about Muslim architecture and history and read Muslim texts to draw inspiration for his design. According to Pei, the light fountain in 9th century Ibn Tulun Mosque of Cairo was the inspiration.Solaiman Abdullah Elkhereiji, Islamic Architecture Past Present & Future. SAK, Jeddah, 2016, p.67. Retrieved 8-21-2017. Ceiling with Islamic patterns in the central atrium of the building Declining all proposed sites for the museum, he suggested a stand-alone island for the structure to avoid encroachments by other buildings in the future. It was built off an artificial peninsula, approximately off the Doha Corniche and surrounded by a somewhat crescent-shaped park. Pei requested that the museum spaces be designed by his collaborator on the Louvre project, Wilmotte & Associates, who then assembled a design team including Plowden & Smith (conservation consultants), Isometrix Lighting + Design (lighting consultants), and SG Conseil (AV Consultants) under Turner Projacs. Along with this design team, Leslie E. Robertson Associates was the structural engineer for the project. The main building consists of the five floors, the main dome, and the central tower. It is connected with the education ward via a large central court. Pei utilized creamy limestone for the outer facades to emphasize the various shades during the different times of the day. The five floors are covered by a glass facade to the north, and it provides a panoramic view of the Persian Gulf. The interior of the building is decorated by several Islamic arts, and the large metallic chandelier hung over the main staircase of the lobby. Many elements found in Ibn Tulun Mosque are represented in the building as an abstract form.

The club was founded in 1944 and played under that name until the 1999‚Äì2000 season when they were administratively reformed as Sporting Toulon Var. In 2016 Sporting Toulon Var merged with SC Toulon-Le Las and became Sporting Club Toulon once again.  History  Former logo. Sporting Club Toulon was founded in 1944 after a merge between Sporting Club du Temple and Jeunesse Sportive Toulonnaise during the Vichy France regime. = Genesis = After World War II it joined the French second division and left for only one season in 1946‚Äì1947. After eleven years in the second division, the club reached the highest division in France in 1959, after finishing third in the second division, but was relegated the year after. Toulon has never won the French Cup, but has reached the semi-final on two occasions: in 1963 and 1984. Semi-finalists in 1963, Toulon was eliminated by Olympique Lyonnais. The following year, they finished fourth and were promoted again to the first division, without success. = Progression = Relegated to the French 3rd division during 1980‚Äì1981 season, Toulon was growing stronger in the 1980s. Thanks to the effectiveness of Christian Dalger as a forward, the talent of the leader Alain B√©n√©det or the experience of Rolland Courbis in defence, Toulon was again promoted to the first division in 1983, finishing first in Group B, before Stade de Reims, thanks to a victory away to Grenoble (1‚Äì5). = Division 1 and decadence = During the 1983‚Äì1984 season, Toulon stayed in Division 1 thanks to the 21 goals of Delio Onnis, top scorer in the league that season. The club again reached the semi-finals of the Coupe de France but were defeated by AS Monaco (1‚Äì4, 2‚Äì1). The following season saw Toulon shining and beating Paris Saint-Germain 5‚Äì1. Still third after 31 matches played, they were then defeated three times in a row ‚Äì including another defeat against AS Monaco at home, 1‚Äì0, in front of 18,000 spectators at Stade Mayol, which remains the best performance for the club until now. This demoted them to 5th place, but still put them in contention for qualification to European competition, going into the last game of the season. But a last defeat at home against FC Nantes Atlantique meant the club finished in 6th position, outside the European places. In 1988, the Toulon team including Bernard Casoni, Bernard Pardo and David Ginola, with former player Rolland Courbis as coach, finished 5th in the league but failed to qualify for a European competition due to a weak UEFA coefficient at this time. After several years of uncertainty, the club was relegated in 1993 to the Championnat National ‚Äì the third level of French football ‚Äì due to financial problems. The 1995‚Äì1996 season saw Toulon winning the title in National and promotion to Ligue 2. During the 16th final of the French Cup, they eliminated Girondins de Bordeaux where Zinedine Zidane was playing (3‚Äì2 et) before being beaten on penalties by Montpellier HSC in the next round. Improvements lasted only two years and in 1998, Sporting Club Toulon were relegated back to the Championnat National due to poor results, then administratively in CFA2 (5th level) and finally did not finish the championship because of liquidation. = Back to the amateur level = After financial difficulties which led the club to be expelled from the Championship in the 1998‚Äì1999 season and to turn amateur, the club was reborn under the name \\"Sporting Toulon Var\\", gaining three promotions in four seasons to reach the third division. Candidate to access the 2nd division in 2006‚Äì2007, they have been relegated in 2007 to the French 4th division (CFA). In 2011, DNCG (Direction Nationale de Controle de Gestion) excluded the club from all national competitions and the club will start again in Division d'Honneur (6th division) in 2011‚Äì2012. A new manager Mohamed Sadani was appointed at the beginning of the 2013‚Äì14 season, and after several years struggling in Division d'Honneur, the club won the championship and finally gained promotion to CFA 2, 5th national level. = Merger and return to old name = In February 2016, the club announced a merger with SC Toulon-Le Las, of the CFA. The new club would take the historic name Sporting Club Toulon and play in CFA, with the reserves in CFA2. In 2019 the club won promotion from National 2 as champion of their group. They were relegated the following year after being placed bottom of the league when the 2019‚Äì20 Championnat National season was ended prematurely due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

With over one million people, it is estimated the Haya make up approximately 2% of the population of Tanzania. They speak Haya, a Bantu language of the Niger-Congo family. Historically, the Haya have had a complex kingship-based political system. Agriculture, particularly banana farming, is central to Haya economic life.  Etymology  According to Hans Cory, the term Bahaya (Haya for fisher-people) was originally used to differentiate the Haya from the Banyambo of Karagwe. This distinction is said to be based on cultural differences, with the Haya economy predominantly oriented toward fishing and other industries on Lake Victoria and the Banyambo predominately engaged in pastoralism. Other sources on the origin of the term Haya cite oral accounts that state it derives from a goddess named Muhaya, whose father was King Ruhinda Mushure. This second version is not as popular. Haya history and kingdoms = Early history = Linguistic evidence indicates the Haya settled in the Kagera Region during the time of the Bantu expansion. They are believed to be some of the earliest inhabitants in the region to practice iron smelting and were part of the iron-making Urewe pottery culture (ancestral to many Eastern Bantu groups) dating from the 5th century BC to the 6th century AD. Around 200 BC is when the first strong evidence of Early Iron Age settlements were established along Lake Victoria in Buhaya. Iron tools may have helped expand agricultural production in the region which included a combination of cereal crop cultivation (finger millet and sorghum), root- cropping, and the gradual use of beans. Between 800 and 1500 AD, Bahaya lifeways were greatly influenced by other Bantu peoples moving in from an area further north in the African Great Lakes region. These northern peoples, whose descendants founded the kingdoms of Bunyoro-Kitara and Buganda, are said to have brought with them new breeds of cattle as well as varieties of banana. It remains unclear as to why these peoples moved into the region but evidence indicates severe ecological change that facilitated the movement of people with specialized cattle herding practices for adapting to environmental stress. One of the main strategies for adapting to environmental stress included using cattle manure to maintain soil fertility for banana groves, a practice the Haya continue to this day but at a reduced level due to a decline in cattle holding that began after the 1890s rinderpest epizootic. = Kingdoms (16th to 18th centuries) = Prior to the establishment of Haya kingdoms, land tenure was controlled by corporate groups such as the clan. Religion played a prominent role in pre-dynastic social structure as well and included Bacwezi beliefs guided by practitioners (spirit mediums, diviners, priests and priestesses) capable of communicating with or channeling ancient Bacwezi gods and goddesses. Oral history indicates some clans founded Haya kingdoms beginning around the 16th century, such as the Bayango clan of Kyamtwara Kingdom and the Bakuma clan of Kiziba Kingdom. The third Haya kingdom during this period was Ihangiro to the south of Kyamtwara. Oral accounts state that the Bahinda royal clan entered Kyamtwara Kingdom during the 17th century, coopting the Bayango clan and establishing their rule under King Rugamora Mahe. The Bahinda clan, who ruled Karagwe Kingdom to the west, trace their ancestry to the first king of Ankole, Ruhinda. = Kingdoms (19th century to 1963) = During the late 18th century, Kyamtwara Kingdom broke up due to revolts. Results of this breakup led to the founding of the kingdoms of Kihanja, Bukara, Lesser Kyamtwara, and Bugabo. The outcome of this breakup divided leadership of the four new kingdoms between the Bahinda and the Bakango clans. The Bahinda ruled Kihanja and Bukara while Lesser Kyamtwara and Bugabo were ruled by the Bakango. According to accounts, the Bakango took the opportunity to overthrow the Bahinda who depended on their power. When the German colonial government established their rule in Tanganyika in the 1890s, there were six Haya kingdoms: Kiziba, Ihangiro, Kihanja, Bukara, Lesster Kyamtwara, and Bugabo. After the Anglo-German agreement of 1890, the kingdom of Missenye, north of Kiziba Kingdom, was added, making the total number of Haya kingdoms seven. In 1963, the newly-independent Tanzania government abolished all forms of traditional kingship and chieftainship in the country. Kings with the necessary qualifications were offered jobs by the new government. Five Haya kings took up the offer while the others remained honorary kings and continued to perform their traditional religious and ceremonial duties. = Uganda-Tanzania War = In 1978, the ancestral region to which the Haya belong was subject to an attempted annexation by the former Ugandan president Idi Amin Dada, whose invasion of the Kagera region in the Uganda-Tanzania War eventually led to the toppling of his government by the Army of Tanzania. Haya kingship Haya kings (bakama) had absolute rule over their territory and assigned duties to specific clans. For example, in Kiziba Kingdom it is said the Batunda were royal bodyguards, the Bashonde royal brewers, and the Baihuzi royal cooks. Other duties assigned to clans were providing wives for the king, crushing rebellions, producing iron, and tending the royal cattle. These assigned duties sought to maintain structure in the kingdom. The administrative system of each kingdom was organized hierarchically with the king (mukama) at the top followed by the chief minister (omukuru we kibuga), ministers (batongole), council of advisers (lukiiko), county chiefs (bami b'enshozi), and village headmen (bakungu). These delegations were divided between two categories of authority: the princes (balangira) of royal descent and the king's non-royal followers (batekwa). During British colonial rule, the Ganda term katikiro replaced the Haya term omukuru we kibuga. = Omuteko = Future decisions for non-royal positions were guided by a training program called omuteko (age-set). This program required all boys between the ages of 10 and 12 to report to the king's capital for schooling and training. Selection was carried out by the village headman (mukungu) under the order of the king. Oral accounts describe how the initial training period lasted 10 days and included moral instruction on what was required of boys regarding their duties to the kingdom and their sub-county. After this initial period, boys were sent to the king's royal court for further training that included sports, games, dancing, and singing, all of which were competitive and consisted of each sub-county competing against the other. The best group remained at the court for additional training while the others were sent away for moral and physical training until called upon. Other schooling under omuteko included the art and science of war, history, and culture. Overall, omuteko was off and on, lasting roughly three years and establishing social cohesion among different sub-counties. Estimates indicate 50% of the boys taken in were dismissed after the initial training period. Those who excelled were provided specialized training in the courses they did well in. Young women are said to have been called to the king's court as well under a program called buzana. This program, according to missionary accounts, was largely to appease the sexual appetites of the king. = War and ritual = Important decisions made by kings such as going to war or conducting a raid on a neighboring kingdom are said to have been made inside a divining house called a buchwankwanzi. Inside this structure, the king, along with his most trusted advisers, would base their decisions on what the diviner(s) foretold. The term buchwankwanzi is translated as \\"spitting pearls,\\" which refers to the words of wisdom coming from mouths of those prophesying within. Along with military operations, kings were responsible for the fertility and prosperity of their kingdom such as good crops, healthy livestock, good hunting and fishing, and a productive economy. Some of the most important rituals to ensure these conditions were the new moon ceremonies conducted by the king each month and overseen by religious specialists. These ceremonies involved feasting, consumption of alcohol, offerings to gods and goddesses, and the use of a deceased king's regalia as ritual catalysts. The new moon ceremonies also required kings to visit sacred centers throughout their kingdom with offerings to ancient Bacwezi gods and goddesses believed to be capable of bringing prosperity, fertility, famine, and disease. = Death and renewal = The death of a king brought about a mourning period that required everyone in the kingdom to cease all labor until a new king was installed. Anyone caught breaking this temporary ordinance would be punished. The installment of a new king was not always a smooth transition. Oral histories recount how factions among the royal clan and the court often delayed the installment of a new king, including the king's family as siblings schemed as well as fought one another over the vacant throne. Two of the most sacred objects to successfully secure the throne were the royal drums of the kingdom, closely protected by the clan given charge over them, and the jawbone of the deceased king which required special burial, accompanied by rituals, on his royal burial estate (gashani) within his royal compound (kikale). The former king's regalia and ritual paraphernalia would be amassed and curated in his buchwankwanzi house. Newly elected kings would undergo the rituals of accession and, upon the completion these rituals, the temporary ordinance prohibiting labor would be lifted, bringing order back to the kingdom.  Arab trade and European contact  cowry shells being used as currency by an Arab trader By the mid-19th century the Haya were linked into Arab, Swahili, Nyamwezi, and Sumbwa trade networks. It is unclear when the first Arabs arrived in Buhaya but records indicate the first Arab to visit Buganda was Ahmed bin Ibrahim in 1841, who later visited Karagwe Kingdom and built a residence at Kafuro a few miles east from the kingdom's capital, Bweranyange. By and large, the Arabs were most interested in acquiring ivory and slaves. Goods brought in for exchange included copper coils, cloth, salt, trade beads, Chinese porcelain, and cowrie shells. The introduction of cowrie shells (ensimbi) purportedly displaced the traditional Haya barter system, becoming a form of currency as well as an object used in rituals. Compared to Buhaya kingdoms, Karagwe Kingdom had stronger links to Arab trade networks, with notable trade depots in Kafuro and Kitengure. The presence of Arab traders at Kafuo was, however, short-lived after locals murdered Ahmed bin Ibrahim for his alleged meddling in internal power dynamics following the death of King Rumanyika I of Karagwe.Karagwe The first Europeans to pass through Kagera Region were John H. Speke and James A. Grant during their 1860-1861 expedition in search for the source of the Nile. Their expedition, sponsored by the Royal Geographical Society, started in Zanzibar in October 1860 and took them across the mainland where they arrived in Karagwe in November 1861. It is said that upon their arrival in Karagwe, King Rumanyika I consulted his spiritual advisers and, after clearing Speke and Grant of any threat, waived the entry fee (hongo) typically required foreigners, going so far as to refer to Speke and Grant as his guests. Speke's journal talks kindly of King Rumanyka's hospitality. Speke left Karagwe for Buganda in January 1862 while Grant, forced to remain due to a swollen foot, did not depart until April. The next European to visit the region was Welsh journalist Henry Morton Stanley in 1874. Stanley's expedition, subsidized by the New York Herald and The Daily Telegraph, was to continue mapping the region's lakes and rivers initiated by Speke and Grant. During his travels through the Kingdom of Ihangiro, Stanley's party engaged in a small skirmish with King Ntare II over their passage through his territory. Stanley's party, setting up camp on Bumbire Island, negotiated with King Ntare II and secured passage north through to Karagwe on their way to Buganda. Overall, European interests in Haya kingdoms during this period were of marginal interest compared to Karagwe and Buganda. European colonialism in Buhaya  Compared to Buhaya kingdoms, Karagwe Kingdom was more powerful. However, internal power struggles following the death of King Rumanyika I in 1881 destabilized the kingdom and, with the 1890s rinderpest epizootic killing upwards of 90% of Karagwe's cattle population, the kingdom went into a decline from which it was never able to fully recover. It was around this time the Germans entered the region, whose interests were peaked due to news reports from Speke, Grant, and Stanley's travels. Rather than establish a colonial government, the Germans chose to have a privately sponsored colonialist company, the Society for German Colonization. This society, founded by Carl Peters in 1885, put the Germans in competition with the British presence in Eastern Africa. = German colonialism (1890-1919) = Following the Anglo-German Agreement of 1890, a boundary was drawn between British and German territories along the west side of Lake Victoria. This line placed Buganda under British influence and Buhaya under German influence. In 1902, the southern portion of Buganda known as Missenye was ceded, becoming its own separate kingdom under German rule. The Germans referred to Kagera Region as Zwischenseengebiet (inter-lake area) and included Rwanda and Burundi. In November 1890, the Germans arrived in Bukoba under the command of Emin Pasha. Pasha, with a contingent of around 40 soldiers, established a German boma in Bukoba which at the time was a swamp of uninhabited lower-lands along the shore of Lake Victoria. In addition to establishing a boma, Pasha drew up treaties to submit to Haya kings and recognized chiefs in the region before the arrival of his successor Lieutenant Wilhelm Langheld. Under Langheld's leadership, Haya kingdoms were ruled indirectly. The Haya referred to Langheld as \\"Bwana Mzuri\\" (Mr. Good) not because he was considered a good person but rather due to his overuse of the Swahili word mzuri (good) in his speeches. Langheld's method to keep Haya kings under German control was, in his own words, to \\"play one off against the other.\\" His successor, Lieutenant Carl Herrmann, was no different regarding the use of diplomatic manipulation to keep Haya kingdoms under German control. Along with the arrival of Herrmann was Lieutenant Franz Richter ‚àí the Haya referred to Richter as a Hauptmann (Captain), and his nickname was \\"Bwana Korongo\\" (Mr. Crane or Stork). During the latter part of Richter's command (ca. 1898-1902) he, along with a contingent of askaris and Bahamba (citizens of Kihanja) under the leadership of King Kahigi II, murdered hundreds of Haya from Bukara Kingdom. The event, referred to as the Ngogo massacre, is said to have occurred after Richter became irritated during a confrontation with a gathering of Bakara along the Ngogo River. Richter, who had a heavy hand in Haya affairs through military force and intimidation, has also been implicated in the massacre of 200 people in 1907 during the Maji Maji Rebellion. With the arrival of the Europeans and Christianity the region became famous for yielding the first African Roman Catholic Cardinal the late Cardinal Laurean Rugambwa; they also adopted the European style of formal education earlier when compared to other nearby tribes..  Archaeological discoveries and iron technology  Archaeologist Peter Schmidt discovered evidence through a combination of archaeology and oral tradition that the Haya had been smelting iron ore to make carbon steel for around 2300‚Äì2000 years. This discovery happened when Schmidt was working at the village of Kataruka. Elders at Kataruka informed Schmidt that their ancestors had smelted iron underneath a sacred shrine tree called Kaiija (\\"the place of the forge\\"). Curious to verify their own history, elders asked Schmidt to conduct an excavation underneath the sacred shrine tree. Results of this excavation led to the discovery of an iron furnace carbon-dated to the 1st millennium BC. In the 1970s and 1980s, Schmidt documented a series of experimental smelts to understand social, cultural, and technological processes of past Haya iron making. A challenge at the time is that the Haya had abandoned iron smelting due to the introduction of cheap steel from foreign sources. Haya familiar with iron smelting practices were later tasked with recreating an iron furnace. This included gathering and preparing necessary materials such as iron ore, charcoal, clay to make tuyeres, and grasses. Haya participating in these experiments were able to create a furnace and produce iron of similar quality as those found at Iron Age sites in the region, such as KM2 and KM3. Iron smelting documented during these experiments were similar to open hearth furnace steel making developed in Europe during the 19th century. These experiments led Schmidt to forward his \\"preheating hypothesis.\\" This hypothesis proposes that preheating was a critical component to Early Iron Age technologies in the region, allowing temperatures inside a furnace to reach 1300 to 1400 ¬∞C. During a 1976 experimental smelt, the preheating hypothesis was confirmed. This hypothesis was challenged by David Killick and defended by Schmidt and archaeologist Donald Avery in response to Killick's critique. Schmidt's preheating hypothesis was also tested and again supported by S. Terry Childs in 1996. Pollen core samples in the region document the loss of forested habitats and the expansion of grasslands beginning around the 2nd millennium BC and continuing up to the 11th century AD. It is argued that part of the advancement of grasslands in Kagera Region was due to iron smelting as it required the production of charcoal on a large scale. By 1500 AD, Haya iron smelters introduced the use of Miscanthidium grass (M. grass). As a fast-growing renewable resource, M. grass reduced the need for charcoal. Furthermore, its use allows for a larger carbon contact surface with iron ore inside a furnace, creating a better smelting environment. Culture Traditionally, the Haya are a patrilineal society structured around a clan system (oluganda) with a common totem (omuziro) that all members collectively identify with. Totems are typically an animal, and each clan has proscriptions such as not eating their totem or causing it harm. Haya who continue to practice this tradition believe that anyone who harms or consumes their totem will bring affliction to themselves as well as their family. Moreover, each male head of the household manages a shrine (ekikalo) dedicated to his ancestors. These family shrines are regularly provided offerings such as banana beer (orubisi), unripe bananas, and dried coffee beans to appease ancestral spirits. = Mushonge = Mushonge Museum on the Kamachumu Plateau, Kagera Region, Tanzania The traditional Haya house is called a mushonge. Made out of flexible reeds, wooden poles, banana fiber, and grass, mushonge are built from the top down and are circular in shape with a conical peak. The word mushonge comes from the Haya term mushongole, translated as someone who is wealthy, powerful, and respected. Construction of a mushonge includes the performance of rituals as well as the consumption of alcohol during and after its completion. The spatial arrangement of each mushonge is defined by wooden poles for structural support and include sections for men and women, corralling animals, and shrines honoring ancestors. It is said the size of the mushonge reflected the social hierarchy of the village, with the chief's being the largest followed by religious authorities, clan leaders, sub-clan leaders, and common people. Haya kings often moved throughout their kingdom and lived in a similar structure called a nyaruju (palace). The mushonge gradually shifted to a mud walled design (kiteti) and then a mudbrick design (banda). Today, most Haya live in square houses with a corrugated iron sheet roof. Reasons for the shift from vernacular architecture to a modern design vary and include the issue of space as land was further divided up among the family, Tanzania policies under ujamaa aimed a rural development, and Christian values that viewed the vernacular design as backwards, including its symbolic components that reflect traditional Haya religion. = Agriculture and foodways = Productive soils for raising crops have been a challenge for the Haya due to rainfall leaching nutrients from the soil and the landscapes physical makeup, notably along the coast of Lake Victoria, which provides only patches of fertile soil. To overcome these challenges, the Haya practice mixed farming framed around three types of land: the banana grove (kibanja) surrounding the homestead, tended to all year round as bananas are a perennial plant; family plots (musiri) for supplementary foods such as maize, cassava, sweet potatoes, and other staple foods; and communal grasslands (rweya) for animal grazing and grass cutting for various uses such as mulching, thatching, and flooring. Forested areas are used as well and include harvesting wood for building materials and charcoal to cook food. Haya kibanja, Bukoba, Tanzania The kibanja (plural bibanja) is the most important when it comes to Haya foodways. Kagera Region is said to produce nearly half of Tanzania's banana production with the cooking banana (matoke) making up the majority of the banana yield. The popular food dish matoke includes beans with either beef or fish, and it is seen as a fulfilling meal compared to only consuming crops like maize and cassava. Other varieties of banana include those for making beer (orubisi) and spirits (konyagi) as well as non-cooking types considered to be sweet. Beyond food and nutrition, banana use among the Haya includes their ritual use as offerings to ancestors as well as a ritual called koshobekera believed to assist in a child's growth.Kamanzi, Adalbertus. (2012). \\"They needed an ethnographer:\\" That is why they missed it!‚Äù Exploring the value of bananas among the Haya people of Bukoba, northwestern Tanzania. ASC Working Paper 104, African Studies Centre, Leiden, Netherlands. Raised alongside bananas are coffee shrubs, a once prosperous cash crop for the Haya until market influences coupled with El Ni√±o rains from 1998 to 2000, followed by a severe drought, destroyed much of the crop.Kagera Region (2007). Regional Report, 2002/2003: National Sample Census of Agriculture. United Republic of Tanzania. Rather than roast and brew coffee for drinking, the Haya sun-dry the beans and chew on them. Coffee beans are often provide for guests visiting the homestead and, traditionally, they are left as offerings to ancestors at shrines and, in the past, were used to seal blood-pacts by splitting a single bean in half, cutting one's navel, smearing blood onto the half-bean, and placing the bean in the other participant's mouth. The shortage of cattle manure and other types of agricultural fertilizer has greatly impacted banana production among the Haya. Moreover, the spread of Banana Xanthomonas Wilt (BXW) into the region around 2006 is changing the kibanja way of life, leading to a greater reliance on other crops such as cassava and maize. Another concern cited is the growing youth population in the region and its impact on land inheritance as fathers divide their landholdings to such a degree that kibanja plots are too small to produce enough bananas to feed new families, leading more Haya to orient their efforts to developing communal grasslands (rewya). Communal grasslands include harvesting edible grasshoppers (nsenene) when they are in season. Traditionally, Haya women were required to harvest these grasshoppers by hand, storing captured grasshoppers in a woven basket, and roast them for men to consume. It was considered taboo for women to eat nsenene. Today, this taboo is not followed and Haya men and women consume them. Along with the Haya, other cultural groups in southwestern Uganda harvest nsenene for food as well as income.Agea, J., Biryomumaisho, D.,Buyinza, M., and Nabanoga, G. (2008). Commercialization of Ruspolia nitidula (nsenene grasshoppers) in central Uganda. African Journal of Food, Agriculture, Nutrition, and Development 8(3): 319-332. = Health and medicine = The Haya have a rich array of traditional medicines for treating sickness and disease. Research on Haya ethnomedicine documents the use of dozens of plant species for treating a range of health issues from malaria, skin conditions, infections and wounds, gastrointestinal disorders, and gynecological problems. Prior to modern medicine, Haya health issues were brought to the attention of traditional doctors (often diviners or priests) skilled in medicine and identifying sicknesses. Today, it is not uncommon for a Haya person to seek the services of both a traditional doctor as well as trained medical specialists working at local dispensaries and clinics. Historically, Kagera Region had the first documented case of HIV/AIDS in Tanzania. Described as a region hit hard by the HIV/AIDS epidemic, Kagera Region has an extensive history of HIV/AIDS research, ranging from statistics on reported cases, how families cope with infected loved ones, gender disparities, and the loss of traditional knowledge due to elders suffering from the virus passing away before they can transmit their wisdom to the next generation. = Arts = 420x420px In the area covering the present day Muleba, Bukoba Urban, Bukoba Rural, and Missenyi, as is the case in other areas where Buhaya culture is predominant in the Kagera Region in Tanzania, musical performances - singing, dancing, and playing of musical instruments - are integral parts of everyday life. As is the case in many African societies, among the Haya musical performances are inseparable from the daily events and the social, political and cultural life of the community. Traditionally, events such as marriage, funerals, worship, installation, praise, and exaltation of kings (omukama), celebratory war dances (omutoro) and heroic recitations or self-praise recitations (ebyebugo), healing practices such as cleansing and chasing away evil spirits, and all occasions calling for celebration produced performances. In 1952 world-renowned ethnomusicologist, Hugh Tracey, recorded songs of the Haya people. These songs are preserved by the International Library of African Music. A sample of one of these songs include the use of enkoito drum rhythms.

It was created along with Lake Freeman in the 1920s when two dams were built outside of Monticello on the Tippecanoe River. It remains a popular recreational area and helps generate an estimated $70 million in tourism revenue for White County. History Creation of Lake Shafer began in 1922 with the construction of the Norway Dam at river mile 30.2 above the confluence of the Wabash River. Construction of the dam finished in June, 1923, and it remains standing approximately one mile north of Monticello. Lake Shafer remains the more commercial of the Twin Lakes, largely due to the presence of the Indiana Beach Amusement Park and Camp Resort. There are also a vast number of rental cottages and homes as well as boat rental marinas. Many of Lake Shafer's residents are part-timers, spending the majority of their time at the lake on weekends, traditionally April through October. The lake is often busy with boat traffic on summer weekends due to the increase in tourists. Ecology Because it is located in the Tippecanoe River drainage basin, it is a natural sediment trap. These feeding sediments have caused some parts of the northern part of the lake to be shallowed to as low as 4 feet. Since 2004, there have been active efforts on the lake to dredge many parts of the shallow areas on the lake to remove debris from the bottom of the lake, remove sandbars, and increase the lake's depth. Since formed, Lake Shafer has been drained in 1965, 1975, 1985, and 1995, so repair work could be made to the Norway Dam.. It was announced that in late April 2008, Lake Shafer will be drained once again for repairs to the Norway Dam. It will be drained 3 feet the weekend of April 26‚Äì27, and six feet by May 3‚Äì4. Only the main riverbed will remain during the draining of it.

In its core values and activities, The Homestead has much in common with intentional communities like Dancing Rabbit Ecovillage (Missouri), Sandhill Farm (Missouri), and Cobb Hill CoHousing (Vermont). It differs from these communities in its direct connection to a liberal arts college, and its lack of long-term residents. As all Homesteaders are students, their residencies last from one semester to three years. The Homestead differs dramatically from typical college housing arrangements. It has no television, and no internet access (Homesteaders visit the Denison main campus to use the internet). Its structures and utilities are designed, built or installed, maintained, and improved by students (as feasible.) It relies heavily on alternative and renewable sources of energy. Technologies have included an off-the-grid photovoltaic system for limited electricity, wood stoves for heat and cooking, and passive solar design as another source of building heat. The Homestead is located on about in a wooded valley; students typically walk or bike the one mile (1.6 km) to the Denison main campus. Originally, three wooden cabins (built in 1977-78) served as residential spaces for the twelve Homesteaders. A strawbale cabin (named Cabin Bob in honor of Robert Alrutz, built in 1999-2001) serves as a kitchen and community center. An earthship named Cabin Phoenix was completed in 2009. Homesteaders grow some of their own food, using organic gardens, orchards, beehives, and chickens (for eggs). Manual labor is an integral part of life at The Homestead, as residents must haul and split wood, tend gardens and livestock, maintain and repair buildings, and cook. Each resident must balance the responsibilities of being a Homesteader with those of being a student. Homesteaders receive academic credit only for the annual Homestead Seminar (usually on sustainability issues) and for the summer internship program. The Homestead Coordinator, a Denison employee, advises The Homestead on some of its decisions, and supervises some of its projects. The Homestead Advisory Board (HAB) is composed of Homesteaders, The Homestead Coordinator, and university administration, faculty, and staff. It oversees The Homestead's major decisions, and helps to integrate The Homestead with its parent university. HAB helped to establish The Homestead May Term as an internship open to all Denison students and helps serve as an academic link to the Homestead. The Homestead was the brainchild of Dr. Robert Alrtuz. At a symposium in January 1976, Alrutz raised the idea of a student-run Homestead. Afterwards, nine students approached Alrutz and expressed a desire to make the homestead dream a reality. Alrutz and the students jointly prepared a formal proposal, and won approval (including a startup loan) from the board of trustees. In the summer of 1977, students began construction of The Homestead. They started building three wooden cabins, established a water-well, and grew a sizeable garden. Alrutz supervised the project; the university physical plant and outside volunteers helped. By late September 1977, all of the original eleven Homesteaders had moved into the first two still-unfinished cabins. They installed insulation and wood stoves later that fall. Homesteaders used oil lamps for interior lighting until 1982, when they installed a photovoltaic system. The Homestead has remained an active community since its founding, although membership has varied from four residents to twelve. The extent of on-site gardening and livestock-raising has varied with the interest of the students. In the past ten years, The Homestead has undertaken two ambitious building projects: the strawbale Cabin Bob, and the earthship Cabin Phoenix. Dr. Alrutz died in 1997, but the community he founded lives on.  2013 Projects  After much planning, construction began on a new cabin in the Summer of 2013. In order to keep up with changing building codes, students, faculty, and administration agreed that the best way to maintain the viability of the Homestead in the future was a major update. The new cabin sits on the former site of Cabin 3, which was demolished in the Spring of 2013. Cabin 1 was also retired as a living space and will soon become and art and social space. The new cabin houses up to nine students, and combined with space for three in Cabin Phoenix maintains the capacity of twelve students. The new cabin brings substantial advances in sustainable technology. Heat for all cabins is now generated by an external wood- gasification boiler and transmitted via underground hot water pipes. The cabin itself uses both a radiating retention tank and in-floor radiative heating. A new photovoltaic system was installed that generates more than 10 times the original electrical capacity and maintains a net output onto the grid. Furthermore, enhanced fire alarms and water suppression systems were installed in all residential cabins to prevent catastrophic fires. To keep up with an evolving society, other sustainable conveniences were incorporated into the build, such as showers, laundry, and a composting toilet. Some changes have led to controversy among former residents, however, all such changes were made in concert with the original mission statement. The Archive In May 2012, the Homestead celebrated its 35th anniversary. This sizeable gathering of current and former homesteaders afforded the opportunity to collect, describe, digitize, and preserve the official archive of the Homestead. Joshua Finnell, humanities librarian in the William Howard Doane Library, in collaboration with Linda Krumholz, Associate Professor of English, received funding from an Andrew W. Mellon Next Generation Libraries grant to build the community archive. Several Homesteaders, including Ryan Culligan, Juan Pablo Torres, and Henry Jochem, helped build the archive during the summer of 2012. The complete archive was constructed, and is currently hosted, in the OhioLink Digital Resource Commons under a Creative Commons ShareAlike Copyright license.

The fourteener is located on the Sierra Blanca Massif, north by east (bearing 6¬∞) of the Town of Blanca, Colorado, United States, on the drainage divide separating Rio Grande National Forest and Alamosa County from the Sangre de Cristo Land Grant and Costilla County. Little Bear lies southwest of Blanca Peak, the ultra prominent fourteener that is the highest point of the massif. Mountain Like the rest of the Sierra Blanca Massif, Little Bear is composed of pre-Cambrian granite estimated to be approximately 1.8 billion years old. Along with nearby Blanca Peak and Ellingwood Point Little Bear rises nearly 7,000 feet above the San Luis Valley to the west and south. The peak sits atop a long ridge separating two glacier- carved valleys. The connecting ridge between Little Bear Peak and Blanca Peak Looking down on Como Lake from the summit of Little Bear While Little Bear itself has little more than the minimum 300 feet of prominence to qualify as a separate peak, it is notable for being one of the most technically difficult and dangerous of the fourteeners to climb. The upper part of the standard route leads through a 300' section known as the Hourglass: a water-polished granite slab famous for the amount of rockfall.Little Bear on Summitpost There is another technical route that climbs the northwest face of Little Bear from above the Blue Lakes and gains over 6,200 ft in elevation. The easiest climbing routes on the mountain are on the eastern side, rising out of the private property in Blanca Basin. The connecting ridge to Blanca Peak is one of the most challenging outings of its type in the state. Experts say the traverse is easier going from Little Bear to Blanca but once a climber commits to the traverse, he's committed to the end. There are only a couple places down off the rock that are reasonably safe and they drop into Blanca Basin. Little Bear is bisected by the boundary between the Rio Grande National Forest to the west and private property to the east, and is on the border between Alamosa County and Costilla County.

Officially premiered in 1920 at the Royal Military School of Music, the manuscript was originally completed in 1909. Along with the subsequent Second Suite in F for Military Band, written in 1911 and premiered in 1922, the First Suite convinced many other prominent composers that serious music could be written specifically for band.  Background  Bands first evolved in the military, with the Royal Artillery Band being formed in 1557, but at the turn of the 20th Century the term \\"military band\\" was being applied to any ensemble that incorporated woodwinds, brass and percussion, including civilian bands organised by local police, fire brigades, and even industrial firms. The majority of music played by British military bands around this time consisted of popular music and orchestral transcriptions. No serious music had yet been composed specifically for the band medium, and there was no standardised instrumentation. The lack of a set instrumentation was a major obstacle for composers, in addition to the pervasive belief that an ensemble of assorted wind instruments lacked the tonal cohesiveness to produce significant music. The Suite in E was Holst's first composition written for military band. Frederick Fennell, in Time and the Winds, observes that Holst's scoring for the work is so well conceived and organised for the band medium, that he must have had some previous experiences with groups of this kind. Indeed, Holst was himself a formidable trombonist, having already performed several seasons with the Scottish Orchestra prior to the composition of the suite. In addition, while still in college, he performed during the summers with various seaside bands, and was admittedly unsatisfied with the music that those ensembles performed. Even though these experiences likely contributed to the composition of the suite, there is no recorded commission for the work, and the reason for Holst's writing of the suite is unknown. In addition to being a serious work written for band, the orchestration of the suite was tailored to handle the inherent challenges of the military band. As there was no standardised instrumentation, Holst scored the suite for 19 instruments, with 17 remaining parts labelled \\"ad lib.\\", meaning they were unnecessary for performance. As most British military bands of the day employed between 20 and 30 musicians, the 19 required parts could reasonably be expected to be covered, and the remaining parts could be added or discarded as needed without disturbing the integrity of the work. The First Suite was a catalysing force that convinced many other prominent composers that serious music could be written specifically for the combination of woodwinds, percussion and brass. Works such as the English Folk Song Suite (1923) of Ralph Vaughan Williams and the William Byrd Suite (1923) of Gordon Jacob are leading examples. The piece was later arranged for brass band by Sydney Herbert, and this arrangement has been used as a contest set test piece on numerous occasions, including for the British regional brass band championships in 1970, 1983 and 2019.  Structure  The First Suite has three movements, each with its own character and form. It is not apparent from the score, but Holst let it be known that the three movements should follow each other without a break. The complete composition is based upon an eight-bar melody reminiscent of English folk song; however, the tune is original to Holst. Most notably, the theme statement that initiates the first movement is developed throughout each movement: : ew Staff \\\\with { \\\\remove \\"Time_signature_engraver\\" } \\\\relative c' { \\\\clef treble \\\\key ees \\\\major ees f c' } Its variations range in style from lyrical to playfully rhythmic to ornamentally embellished. = Movement 1: \\"Chaconne\\" = : \\\\relative c { \\\\clef bass \\\\time 3/4 \\\\key ees \\\\major \\\\tempo \\"Allegro moderato\\" \\\\partial 4*1 ees( f2 c'4  bes2 g4  ees f2  bes,2) g4(  c2 d4  g f2  bes2.~  bes2) } This movement, in time, is based upon an eight-bar melody initiated by the low brass which repeats sixteen times throughout the piece. The rhythm of the theme with its minim‚Äìcrotchet and crotchet‚Äìminim rhythm is believed to be based upon medieval English carols; the \\"Agincourt Song\\" from 1415 in particular bears a strong resemblance. Holst uses many colourful effects to vary the chaconne theme. These include \\"band hits\\" (synonymous with the popular term \\"orchestra hits\\") in the brass and percussion outlining the notes of the theme while the woodwinds play virtuosic semiquaver runs. The whole passage is marked brilliante or \\"brilliantly\\". Immediately following this is a famous low brass excerpt where they play a quaver line based again on the notes of the theme. This section is marked pesante or \\"heavily\\" which sharply contrasts with the material directly before. Following this are more variations using mostly combinations of solo instruments including a solo horn, duet between flute and oboe, and solo alto saxophone. This section eventually develops into a minor key. Two of the repetitions, the tenth and eleventh, are an inversion of the theme: : \\\\relative c { \\\\clef bass \\\\key ees \\\\major \\\\time 3/4 \\\\partial 4*1 ees  d2 g,4  aes2 c4  ees d2  aes' c4  g2 f4~  f c d  g2.~  g2 } Here the mood changes drastically with a funeral march like feel with the dynamics exceptionally soft. The bass drum and tuba emphasise a hemiola rhythm while a solo euphonium plays the inversion in a minor key. The twelfth repetition, the theme played a third higher, is a famous trombone soli that hints at Holst's earlier years as a trombone player. Then a crescendo poco a poco extends over two more repetitions of the theme. At the height of the crescendo, more hemiola in the brass and saxophones is used to heighten the harmonic interest. The climax is at the top of the crescendo with the theme being stated in almost all of the low instruments. The higher instruments play soaring counterpoint lines, all of which is marked . The final repetition, stated in the trombones and low trumpets/cornets (an unusual combination for its day) is transposed up a fifth, chromatically altered, and extended. The movement ends with the trombones and trumpets/cornets playing against the rest of the band playing on beats one and two while the rest of the band is striking sustained chords on the third beat of the bar. Holst, in the final chord, drops out all of the bass voices from the band leaving a very brilliant sounding chord with high concert Bs in the flutes, piccolos, and trumpets/cornets. This powerful coda is difficult to play well, but has very high emotional impact when it is. = Movement 2: \\"Intermezzo\\" = : \\\\relative c' { \\\\clef treble \\\\key c \\\\minor \\\\time 2/4 \\\\tempo \\"Vivace\\" \\\\partial 8*1 ees8\\\\mf->  f-> c'4-> c8  ees8.([ d16 c8-.) d-.]  bes8.([ c16 bes8-.) g-.]  bes4. } Nearly all of this movement is devoted to a rhythmic and well-articulated oboe, clarinet and cornet solo. The exploitation of wind band tone colour combinations flavour this movement. While the movement is predominantly light in character, the clarinet has a stirring solo, which is later repeated by other voices: : \\\\relative c' { \\\\clef treble umericTimeSignature \\\\time 4/4 \\\\key c \\\\minor r4 c( d ees  f) f( c') c8( d)  ees4( d8 c bes4) c(  bes4. g8) g( f ees4  f2.) } Then, the euphonium (or alto clarinet) takes us back to the first theme. Finally the second theme is played in a major key while the upper woodwinds play their virtuosic semiquavers, and diminishes to the lowest possible volume. = Movement 3: \\"March\\" = : \\\\relative c { \\\\clef treble \\\\key ees \\\\major umericTimeSignature \\\\time 2/2 r ees-.\\\\ff d-. g,-. } The march is usually played at a march tempo, although many recordings use a faster tempo. It opens with a famous bass drum solo, one of the few in the band literature. It features two primary melodies both very contrasting in style. The first melody is featured exclusively in the brass section in a very marcato manner. The second melody in the mid and low woodwinds, and later the euphonium, baritone saxophone, and bassoon, resembles the melodies of the first two movements and is played in a very legato and lyrical style. Following the completion of the second melody, strains of the first melody and the first four bars can be heard as the movement builds up to the finale. { ew PianoStaff << ew Staff \\\\relative c { \\\\clef treble \\\\key ees \\\\major umericTimeSignature \\\\time 2/2 \\\\partial 2*1 g2^\\"Theme 1\\"  f4 c ees c  d8( ees d c bes4) bes  g c c8( bes c4)  g c } ew Staff \\\\relative c { \\\\clef bass \\\\key ees \\\\major umericTimeSignature \\\\time 2/2 ees2\\\\ff^\\"Theme 2\\"  f c'  bes aes4 g  f ees c2  bes } >> } The finale of the march features both melodies layered on top of one another in a musical technique called \\"simultaneous recapitulation\\": nearly all the brass playing the second melody in a majestic march style, with the woodwinds playing the first melody and variations of it. The last few bars are very powerful (marked ) and have one of the most famous trombone solis in the band repertoire.  Instrumentation and standard editions  =1909 autograph manuscript= The original manuscript, completed in 1909, is housed at the British Library in London. The shelf listing is as follows: > Add. MS 47824. GUSTAV HOLST COLLECTION. Vol. XXI (ff. 37). First Suite in E > flat for military band, op. 28, no. 1, consisting of Chaconne, Intermezzo > and March. [1909.] Full score. Autograph. With various notes on f.1 relating > to ad lib. parts, etc. Published by Boosey & Co., 1921, in Boosey's Military > Journal, 142nd Series, No. 2. [I. Holst, no. 105.] The original title of the suite was simply \\"Suite in E for Military Band by Gustav von Holst\\". Holst's birthname had actually been Gustavus Theodore von Holst (he had German, Russian, Latvian and Swedish forebears, although his great-great-grandfather had emigrated to the UK in 1802). He changed his name to Gustav Holst during World War I (when German names were unpopular) so that he could be appointed as a volunteer YMCA Music Organizer. (The British royal family changed their name from Saxe-Coburg-Gotha to Windsor for a similar reason.) According to the title page of the manuscript, \\"Suite in E\\" is scribbled over, with \\"First Suite in E\\" written underneath and also above and to the right of the original title. In 1921 Boosey & Co. published the parts and a piano reduction for the suite. It was common practice at this time to not include a full instrumental score. =1948 Boosey and Hawkes full score= The 1948 edition of the First Suite in E was the first since the original Boosey & Co. publication of 1921. With developments in instrumentation in the United States during the two decades following the original published version, there were calls for a newer, more accessible edition. The growing popularity of school band contests resulted in American bands incorporating a wide array of instruments such as the alto and contrabass clarinets, and the baritone and bass saxophones. With more and more bands employing these larger forces, the original version of the First Suite could not be performed as written. In addition, the 1921 edition only had a reduced piano score, and by this time the manuscript had been lost. Albert Austin Harding, longtime Director of Bands at the University of Illinois, suggested that the First Suite be revised to accommodate the growing number of American bands and their modern instrumentation. To facilitate this, a new full score based on the original published parts was produced by Boosey & Hawkes. Multiple errors are found in the score that are not shown in the original parts. This new edition contained several modifications: *The flute and piccolo, originally keyed in D, were changed to the key of C, as this was becoming increasingly popular. *The B baritone part was discarded. ::In 1921, at a conference of the Directors of Music of the Navy, Army and Air Force, held at Kneller Hall, it was decided that the B tenor saxophone would officially replace the B baritone. H. E. Adkins states that this was due to baritone's ‚Äúlack of character and its ineffectiveness.‚Äù *In addition to the removal of the baritone, the string bass was also omitted. ::At this time, it is not known why the string bass was removed. It may simply be that school bands did not incorporate it (as is largely the case today). It may also be that, since the string bass was marked ad lib by Holst, Boosey & Hawkes did not feel the need to include it. *Instruments added to the score included the E alto clarinet, the E baritone and B bass saxophones, B contrabass clarinet, and a set of fl√ºgelhorns. =1984 Boosey and Hawkes revised edition (edited by Colin Matthews)= Sometime after the publication of the 1921 edition, the original manuscript was lost. As a result, the only full score available of the First Suite was from 1948 edition, and many conductors struggled with the peculiarities contained therein. It was well known which instruments were additions to the original, but because the 1921 score was only a piano reduction, Holst's original intentions remained unclear. Then, in 1974, the original manuscript was discovered. Frederick Fennell, in a reprint of his 1975 article discussing the suite, states: > ‚ÄúShortly after this initial piece in our Basic Band Repertory series was > published, the manuscript of the Suite in E for Military Band surfaced for > the first time. The full score always existed and it could have answered all > the questions which were raised in my initial study and in the minds of > other conductors whose pursuits of definite answers in this has been an > equal frustration.‚Äù Among the questions raised were those concerning the scoring discrepancies associated with the alto clarinet and baritone saxophone. In light of these realisations, a new, revised score was subsequently prepared by English composer Colin Matthews, with the assistance of Imogen Holst and Frederick Fennell. This new edition was published in 1984 by Boosey & Hawkes. Matthews knew that a complete return to the scoring of the manuscript would once again limit the accessibility of the work, particularly in the United States, where American bands are still to this day typically larger than their British counterparts. In the introduction to the revised score, Matthews states: > ‚ÄúSince the composition of military bands and wind bands in general has > changed since 1909, this new edition of the score does not attempt to go > back wholly to the original manuscript‚Ä¶ The second pair of trumpets and the > baritone have been omitted entirely, while the added baritone and bass > saxophones have been retained (with some emendations). The additional parts > for alto and contrabass clarinets and fl√ºgelhorns have been omitted... The > omission of the baritone has allowed the euphonium part to be expanded, most > notably in the Intermezzo after letter D, and at the beginning of the > Finale, where it doubles the 1st cornet at the lower octave.‚Äù Matthews also makes modifications to the cornets, trumpets and horns. He writes: > ‚ÄúParticular care has been taken to ‚Äòcover‚Äô ad lib parts. Since in the > original manuscript all the trumpets were ad lib, the omission of the second > pair has not left any serious gaps: indeed the opportunity has been taken to > fill one or two that Holst himself left (in the Finale at letter C, for > example). Three cornets are essential, but the parts have been adjusted, > since Holst, when writing for cornets in three parts tended to write for two > second cornets (at the end of the first movement and the Finale the fourth > cornet is optional). In the same way he was occasionally careless about the > disposition of his four horn parts, and these are now organized so that the > third and fourth may safely be omitted.‚Äù The three standard versions' instrumentations are listed below side by side for comparison. 1909 autograph manuscript ;Woodwinds: :Flute/Piccolo in D :2 Oboes (ad lib) :2 Clarinets in E (2nd ad lib) :Solo Clarinet in B :3 Clarinets in B (first ripieno) :Bass Clarinet in B (ad lib) :2 Bassoons (2nd ad lib) :Alto Saxophone in E (ad lib) :Tenor Saxophone in B (ad lib) ;Brass: :2 Cornets in B :2 Trumpets in E (ad lib) :2 Trumpets in B (ad lib) :2 Horns in F :2 Horns in E (ad lib) :Baritone Horn in B (ad lib) :2 Tenor Trombones (2nd ad lib) :Bass Trombone :Euphonium in B :Bombardons (an early form of the Tuba) ;Percussion: :Timpani (ad lib) :Snare Drum :Bass Drum :Cymbals :Triangle :Tambourine ;Strings: :Double Bass (ad lib) 1948 Boosey and Co. full score ;Woodwinds: :Flute/Piccolo in C :Flute/Piccolo in D :2 Oboes :2 Clarinets in E :Solo Clarinet in B :3 Clarinets in B :Alto Clarinet in E :Bass Clarinet in B :Contrabass clarinet in B :2 Bassoons :Alto Saxophone in E :Tenor Saxophone in B :Baritone Saxophone in E :Bass Saxophone in B ;Brass: :2 Cornets in B (1st called \\"solo\\") :2 Trumpets in B :2 Flugelhorns :4 Horns in E (though the parts are in F) :2 Tenor Trombones :Bass Trombone :Baritone in B (Euphonium part in treble clef) :Euphonium :\\"Basses\\" (Tuba and Double Basses) ;Percussion: :Timpani :Snare Drum :Bass Drum :Cymbals :Triangle :Tambourine 1984 Boosey and Hawkes revised edition ;Woodwinds: :Piccolo in C :Flute in C :2 Oboes (2nd ad lib) :2 Clarinets in E (2nd ad lib) :Solo Clarinet in B :3 Clarinets in B :Bass Clarinet in B (ad lib) :2 Bassoons (2nd ad lib) :Alto Saxophone in E :Tenor Saxophone in B :Baritone Saxophone in E (ad lib) :Bass Saxophone in B (ad lib) ;Brass: :Solo Cornet in B :2 Cornets in B :2 Trumpets in B (ad lib) :4 Horns in F (3rd and 4th ad lib) :3 Trombones (2nd ad lib) :Euphonium :Tuba ;Percussion: :Timpani (ad lib) :Snare Drum :Bass Drum :Cymbals :Suspended Cymbal :Triangle :Tambourine ;Strings: :Double Bass (ad lib) ;Not in score but included set for convenience: :(all ad lib) :Alto Clarinet in E :Contrabass Clarinet in B :2 Flugelhorns in B  Other band works by Gustav Holst  * Hammersmith * A Moorside Suite (for brass band) * Three Folk Tunes * The Praise of King Olaf (for choir and military band) * Marching Song (transcription from Two Songs Without Words) * Johann Sebastian Bach's Fugue √† la Gigue transcribed for military band (actually scored as a test piece for Hammersmith.) * Second Suite in F References *Udell, Budd (1982). \\"Standard Works for Band: Gustav Holst's First Suite in E Major for Military Band.\\" Music Educators Journal, 69 (4):28 (JSTOR subscription access) *Khalili, Esmail.

In current English usage, Hadza is the most commonly used term. are an indigenous ethnic group in north-central Tanzania, living around Lake Eyasi in the central Rift Valley and in the neighboring Serengeti Plateau. There are, as of 2015, between 1,200 and 1,300 Hadza people living in Tanzania, however only around 400 Hadza still survive exclusively based on the traditional means of foraging. Additionally, the increasing impact of tourism and encroaching pastoralists pose serious threats to the continuation of their traditional way of life. Genetically, the Hadza are not closely related to any other people. Once classified among the Khoisan languages, primarily because it has clicks, the Hadza language (Hadzane) is actually thought to be an isolate, unrelated to any other. Hadzane is an entirely oral language, but it is not predicted to be in danger of extinction. UNESCO states that the language is not endangered but vulnerable because most children learn it but the use is restricted to certain areas of life, for example to the home. Hadzane is also considered the most important factor of distinguishing who is and is not actually a part of the Hadza people. In more recent years, many of the Hadza have learned Swahili, the national language of Tanzania, as a second language. As descendants of Tanzania's aboriginal, pre- Bantu expansion hunter-gatherer population, they have probably occupied their current territory for thousands of years, with relatively little modification to their basic way of life until the past hundred years. Since the 18th century, the Hadza have come into increasing contact with farming and herding people entering Hadzaland and its vicinity; the interactions were often hostile and caused population decline in the late 19th century. The first European contact and written accounts of the Hadza are from the late 19th century. Since then, there have been many attempts by successive colonial administrations, the independent Tanzanian government, and foreign missionaries to settle the Hadza, by introducing farming and Christianity. These efforts have largely failed, and many Hadza still pursue virtually the same way of life as their ancestors are described as having in early 20th- century accounts. In recent years, they have been under pressure from neighbouring groups encroaching on their land, and also have been affected by tourism and safari hunting. History = Oral tradition = One telling of Hadza's oral history divides their past into four epochs, each inhabited by a different culture. According to this tradition, in the beginning of time the world was inhabited by hairy giants called the akakaanebee \\"first ones\\" or geranebee \\"ancient ones\\". The akakaanebee did not possess tools or fire; they hunted game by running it down until it fell dead; they ate the meat raw. They did not build houses but slept under trees, as the Hadza do today in the dry season. In older versions of this story, fire was not used because it was physically impossible in the earth's primeval state, while younger Hadza, who have been to school, say that the akakaanebee simply did not know how. In the second epoch, the akakaanebee were succeeded by the xhaaxhaanebee \\"in-between ones\\", equally gigantic but without hair. Fire could be made and used to cook meat, but animals had grown more wary of humans and had to be chased and hunted with dogs. The xhaaxhaanebee were the first people to use medicines and charms to protect themselves from enemies and initiated the rite. They lived in caves. The third epoch was inhabited by the people of hamakwanebee \\"recent days\\", who were smaller than their predecessors. They invented bows and arrows, and containers for cooking, and mastered the use of fire. They also built huts like those of Hadza today. The people of hamakwabee were the first of the Hadza ancestors to have contact with non-foraging people, with whom they traded for iron to make knives and arrowheads. They also invented the gambling game lukuchuko. The fourth epoch continues today and is inhabited by the hamayishonebee \\"those of today\\". When discussing the hamayishonebee epoch, people often mention specific names and places, and can approximately say how many generations ago events occurred. =Archaeology and genetic history= The Hadza are not closely related to any other people. The Hadza language was once classified with the Khoisan languages because it has clicks; however, since there is no evidence they are related, Hadza is now considered an isolate.Sands, Bonny E. (1998) 'The Linguistic Relationship between Hadza and Khoisan' In Schladt, Matthias (ed.) Language, Identity, and Conceptualization among the Khoisan (Quellen zur Khoisan-Forschung Vol. 15), K√∂ln: R√ºdiger K√∂ppe, 265-283. Genetically, the Hadza do not appear to be particularly closely related to Khoisan speakers: even the Sandawe, who live just away, diverged from the Hadza more than 15,000 years ago. Genetic testing also suggests significant admixture has occurred between the Hadza and Bantu, while minor admixture with the Nilotic and Cushitic-speaking populations has occurred in the last few thousand years. Today, a few Hadza women marry into neighbouring groups such as the Bantu Isanzu and the Nilotic Datoga, but these marriages often fail and the woman and her children return to the Hadza. In previous decades, rape or capture of Hadza women by outsiders seems to have been common. During a famine in 1918-20 some Hadza men were reported as taking Isanzu wives. The Hadza's ancestors have probably lived in their current territory for tens of thousands of years. Hadzaland is just from Olduvai Gorge, an area sometimes called the \\"Cradle of Mankind\\" because of the number of hominin fossils found there, and from the prehistoric site of Laetoli. Archaeological evidence suggests that the area has been continuously occupied by hunter gatherers much like the Hadza since at least the beginning of the Later Stone Age, 50,000 years ago. Although the Hadza do not make rock art today, they consider several rock art sites within their territory, probably at least 2,000 years old, to have been created by their ancestors, and their oral history does not suggest they moved to Hadzaland from elsewhere. The Hadza population is dominated by haplogroup B2-M112 (Y-DNA). There are also Y-haplogroups E1b1a and E1b1b.Daniel Shriner et al. Genetic Ancestry of Hadza and Sandawe Peoples Reveals Ancient Population Structure in Africa, Genome Biology and Evolution, Volume 10, Issue 3, 1 March 2018, Pages 875‚Äì882, 14 March 2018 =Precolonial period= Until about 500 BCE, Tanzania was exclusively occupied by hunter-gatherers akin to the Hadza. The first agriculturalists to enter the region were Cushitic-speaking cattle herders from the Horn of Africa. Around 500 CE the Bantu expansion reached Tanzania, bringing populations of farmers with iron tools and weapons. The last major ethnic group to enter the region were Nilotic pastoralists who migrated south from Sudan in the 18th century. Each of these expansions of farming and herding peoples displaced earlier populations of hunter-gatherers, who would have generally been at a demographic and technological disadvantage, and vulnerable to the loss of environment resources (i.e., foraging areas and habitats for game) as a result of the spread of farmland and pastures. Therefore, groups such as the Hadza and the Sandawe are remnants of indigenous hunter-gatherer populations that were once much more widespread, and are under pressure from the continued expansion of agriculture into areas which they have traditionally occupied. Farmers and herders appeared in the vicinity of Hadzaland relatively recently. The pastoralist Iraqw and Datoga were both forced to migrate into the area by the expansion of the Maasai, the former in the 19th century and the latter in the 1910s. The Isanzu, a Bantu farming people, began living just south of Hadzaland around 1850. The Hadza also have contact with the Maasai and the Sukuma west of Lake Eyasi. The Hadza's interaction with many of these peoples has been hostile. In particular, the upheavals caused by the Maasai expansion in the late 19th century caused a decline in the Hadza population. Pastoralists often killed Hadza as reprisals for the \\"theft\\" of livestock, since the Hadza did not have the notion of animal ownership, and would hunt them as they would wild game. The Isanzu were also hostile to the Hadza at times, and may have captured them for the slave trade until as late as the 1870s (when it was halted by the German colonial government). Later interaction was more peaceable, with the two peoples sometimes intermarrying and residing together, though as late as 1912, the Hadza are reported as being \\"ready for war\\" with the Isanzu. The Sukuma and the Hadza also had a more amiable relationship; the Sukuma drove their herds and salt caravans through Hadza lands, and exchanged old metal tools, which the Hadza made into arrowheads, for the right to hunt elephants in Hadzaland. The general attitude of neighbouring agro-pastoralists towards the Hadza was prejudicial; they viewed them as backwards, not possessing a \\"real language\\", and made up of the dispossessed of neighbouring tribes that had fled into the forest out of poverty or because they committed a crime. Many of these misconceptions were transmitted to early colonial visitors to the region who wrote about the Hadza. =20th century= The Hadza's way of life is highly conservative. Huts have been built in this style for as long as records have been kept. In the late 19th century, European powers claimed much of the African continent as colonies, a period known as the Scramble for Africa. The Hadza became part of German East Africa, though at the time the colony was proclaimed there is no evidence that Hadzaland had ever been visited by Europeans. The earliest mention of the Hadza in a written account is in German explorer Oscar Baumann's Durch Massailand zur Nilquelle (1894). The Hadza hid from Baumann and other early explorers, and their descriptions are based on second hand accounts. The first Europeans to report actually meeting the Hadza are Otto Dempwolff and Erich Obst. The latter lived with them for eight weeks in 1911. German Tanganyika came under British control at the end of the First World War (1917), and soon after the Hadza were written about by British colonial officer F. J. Bagshawe. The accounts of these early European visitors portray the Hadza at the beginning of the 20th century as living in much the same way as they do today. Early on Obst noted a distinction between the 'pure' Hadza (that is, those subsisting purely by hunting and gathering) and those that lived with the Isanzu and practised some cultivation. The foraging Hadza exploited the same foods using many of the same techniques they do today, though game was more plentiful because farmers had not yet begun directly encroaching on their lands. Some early reports describe the Hadza as having chiefs or big men, but they were probably mistaken; more reliable accounts portray early 20th century Hadza as egalitarian, as they are today. They also lived in similarly sized camps, used the same tools, built houses in the same style and had similar religious beliefs. The British colonial government tried to make the Hadza settle down and adopt farming in 1927, the first of many government attempts to settle them. The British tried again in 1939, as did the independent Tanzanian government in 1965 and 1990, and various foreign missionary groups since the 1960s. Although many attempts were forceful, they by and large failed; generally the Hadza willingly settle and take advantage of provided food, but leave and return to foraging when the food runs out; few have adopted farming. Another problem is disease ‚Äì because their communities are sparse and isolated, few Hadza are immune to common infectious diseases such as measles, which thrive in sedentary communities, and several settlement attempts ended with outbreaks of illness resulting in many deaths, particularly of children. Of the four villages built for the Hadza since 1965, two (Yaeda Chini and Munguli) are now inhabited by the Isanzu, Iraqw and Datoga. Another, Mongo wa Mono, established in 1988, is sporadically occupied by Hadza groups who stay there for a few months at a time, either farming, foraging or taking advantage of food given to them by missionaries. At the fourth village, Endamagha (also known as Mwonyembe), the school is attended by Hadza children, but they account for just a third of the students there. Numerous attempts to convert the Hadza to Christianity have also been largely unsuccessful. Tanzanian farmers began moving into the Mangola area to grow onions in the 1940s, but came in small numbers until the 1960s. The first German plantation in Hadzaland was established in 1928, and later three European families have settled in the area. Since the 1960s, the Hadza have been visited regularly by anthropologists, linguists, geneticists and other researchers. =Present= In recent years, the Hadza's territory has seen increasing encroachment from neighbouring peoples. The western Hadza lands are on a private hunting reserve, and the Hadza are officially restricted to a reservation within the reserve and prohibited from hunting there. The Yaeda Valley, long uninhabited due to the tsetse fly, is now occupied by Datooga herders; the Datooga are clearing the Hadza lands on either side of the now fully settled valley for pasture for their goats and cattle. They hunt out the game, and the clearing destroys the berries, tubers, and honey that the Hadza rely on, and watering holes for their cattle cause the shallow watering holes the Hadza rely on to dry up. Most Hadzabe are no longer able to sustain themselves in the bush without supplementary food such as ugali. After documentaries on the Hadza on PBS and the BBC in 2001, the Mang'ola Hadza have become a tourist attraction. Although on the surface this may appear to help the Hadzabe, much of the money from tourism is allocated by government offices and tourism companies rather than going to the Hadzabe. Money given directly to Hadzabe also contributes to alcoholism and deaths from alcohol poisoning have recently become a severe problem, further contributing to the loss of cultural knowledge. In 2007, the local government controlling the Hadza lands adjacent to the Yaeda Valley leased the entire of land to the Al Nahyan royal family of the United Arab Emirates for use as a \\"personal safari playground\\".McCrummen 2007 (see online) Both the Hadza and Datooga were evicted, with some Hadza resisters imprisoned. However, after protests from the Hadza and negative coverage in the international press, the deal was rescinded. Range Range of the Hadza people (dark grey) in Tanzania Serengeti hunting grounds in Hadzaland. There are four traditional areas of Hadza dry-season habitation: West of the southern end of Lake Eyasi (Dunduhina), between Lake Eyasi and the Yaeda Valley swamp to the east (Tlhiika), east of the Yaeda Valley in the Mbulu Highlands (Siponga), and north of the valley around the town of Mang'ola (Mangola). During the wet season the Hadza camp outside and between these areas, and readily travel between them during the dry season as well. Access to and from the western area is by crossing the southern end of the lake, which is the first part to dry up, or by following the escarpment of the Serengeti Plateau around the northern shore. The Yaeda Valley is easily crossed, and the areas on either side abut the hills south of Mang'ola. The Hadza have traditionally foraged outside these areas, in the Yaeda Valley, on the slopes of Mount Oldeani north of Mang'ola, and up onto the Serengeti Plains. Such foraging is done for hunting, berry collecting, and for honey. Although hunting is illegal in the Serengeti, the Tanzanian authorities recognize that the Hadza are a special case and do not enforce the regulations with them, just as the Hadza are the only people in Tanzania not taxed locally or by the national government. Social structure cannabis The Hadza are organized into bands, called 'camps' in the literature, of typically 20‚Äì30 people, though camps of over a hundred may form during berry season. There is no tribal or other governing hierarchy, and almost all decisions are made by reaching an agreement through discussion. Furthermore, the Hadza are egalitarian, meaning there are no real status differences between individuals. While the elderly receive slightly more respect, within groups of age and sex all individuals are equal, and compared to strictly stratified societies, women are considered fairly equal. This egalitarianism results in high levels of freedom and self-dependency. When conflict does arise, it may be resolved by one of the parties voluntarily moving to another camp. Ernst Fehr and Urs Fischbacher point out that the Hadza people ‚Äúexhibit a considerable amount of altruistic punishment‚Äù to organize these tribes. The Hadza live in a communal setting and engage in cooperative child rearing, where many individuals (both related and unrelated) provide high quality care for children.Crittenden and Marlowe 2008 The Hadza move camp for a number of reasons. Conflict is resolved primarily by leaving camp, and camps frequently split for this reason. Camps are abandoned when someone falls ill and dies, as illness is associated with the place they fell ill. There is also seasonal migration between dry-season refuges, better hunting grounds while water is more abundant, and areas with large numbers of tubers or berry trees when they are in season. If a man kills a particularly large animal such as a giraffe far from home, a camp will temporarily relocate to the kill site (smaller animals are brought back to the camp). Shelters can be built in a few hours, and most of the possessions owned by an individual can be carried on their backs. Having no tribal or governing hierarchy, the Hadza trace descent bilaterally (through paternal and maternal lines), and almost all Hadza can trace some kin tie to all other Hadza people. The Hadza are predominantly monogamous, though there is no social enforcement of monogamy.Marlowe 2005 (see online ) After marriage, the husband and wife are free to live where they decide, which may be with the father or mother's family. This marital residence pattern is called ambilocality, and is common among foragers. Specifically among Hadza, there is a slightly higher frequency of married couples living with the mother's kin rather than the father's kin. While men and women value traits such as hard work when evaluating for partners, they also value physical attractiveness. In fact, many of their preferences for attractiveness, such as symmetry,Little et. al. 2008 averagenessApicella et. al. 2007 and sexually dimorphic voice pitchApicella et. al. 2009 are similar to preferences found in Western nations. A 2001 anthropological study on modern foragers found the Hadza to have an average life expectancy of 33 at birth for both men and women. Life expectancy at age 20 was 39 and the infant mortality rate was 21%. More recently, Hadza adult have frequently lived into their sixties, and some have even reached their seventies or eighties. However, it's important to note that Hadza do not keep track of time and age exactly as the Western world does, and therefore these life expectancies are approximate and highly variable. Subsistence Two men returning from a hunt. Hadza men usually forage individually, and during the course of the day usually feed themselves while foraging, and also bring home some honey, fruit, or wild game when available. Women forage in larger parties, and usually bring home berries, baobab fruit, and tubers, depending on availability. Men and women also forage cooperatively for honey and fruit, and at least one adult male will usually accompany a group of foraging women. During the wet season, the diet is composed mostly of honey, some fruit, tubers, and occasional meat. The contribution of meat to the diet increases in the dry season, when game become concentrated around sources of water. During this time, men often hunt in pairs, and spend entire nights lying in wait by waterholes, hoping to shoot animals that approach for a night-time drink, with bows and arrows treated with poison. The poison is made of the branches of the shrub Adenium coetaneum.Kohl-Larsen 1956a: 226 (= note 23) The Hadza are highly skilled, selective, and opportunistic foragers, and adjust their diet according to season and circumstance. Depending on local availability, some groups might rely more heavily on tubers, others on berries, others on meat. This variability is the result of their opportunism and adjustment to prevailing conditions. Traditionally, the Hadza do not make use of hunting dogs, although this custom has been recently borrowed from neighboring tribes to some degree. Most men (80%+) do not use dogs when foraging. Women's foraging technology includes the digging stick, grass baskets for carrying berries, large fabric or skin pouches for carrying items, knives, shoes, other clothing, and various small items held in a pouch around the neck. Men carry axes, bows, poisoned and non-poisoned arrows, knives, small honey pots, fire drills, shoes and apparel, and various small items. While men specialize in procuring meat, honey, and baobab fruit, women specialize in tubers, berries, and greens. This division of labor is rather apparent, but women will occasionally gather a small animal or egg, or gather honey, and men will occasionally bring a tuber or some berries back to camp. A myth depicts a woman harvesting the honey of wild bees, and at the same time, it declares that the job of honey harvesting belongs to the men.Kohl-Larsen 1956a: 19, 225 (note 5) For harvesting honey or fruit from large trees such as the baobab, the Hadza beat pointed sticks into the trunk of the tree as ladders. This technique is depicted in a tale,Kohl-Larsen 1956a: 26‚Äì29 and it is also documented in film.Heller & Keulig 1999 There exists a dynamic relationship of mutualism and manipulation between a wild bird, the Greater honeyguide (Indicator indicator) and the Hadza.Giamo 2016 In order to obtain wax, the bird guides people to the nests of wild bees (i.e. Apis mellifera). Hadza men whistle, strike trees, and sometimes shout to attract and keep the attention of the honeyguide.Crittenden 2011 The bird also calls to attract the honey- hunter, using a distinctive chatter. Once the honey-hunter has located the bee nest, he uses smoke to subdue the bees, and his axe to chop into the tree and open the bee nest. The honey hunter eats or carries away most of the liquid honey, and the honeyguide consumes beeswax that may be left adhering to the tree, or which has been spit out or otherwise discarded at the site of acquisition. In many cases, instead of actively feeding the honeyguide, Hadza men burn, bury, or hide the wax that remains at the harvest site, in order to keep the honeyguide hungry, and more likely to guide again. The honeyguide also appears in Hadza mythology, both in naturalisticKohl-Larsen 1956a: 18 and personified forms.Kohl-Larsen 1956a: 21 Honey represents a substantial portion of the Hadza diet (~10-20% of calories) and is an important food for many hunter-gatherer societies living in the tropics.Marlow et al. 2014 The increased consumption of bee products contributed to an improvement in the energy density of the human diet during evolution.  Religion, myths, and tales  = Religion = While the Hadza certainly have cosmologies and myths they believe in and pass on from generation to generation, they are generally not characterized as having a formal, complex religion. This is because they don't have places of worship, religious leaders, gods, idols, belief in an afterlife, or frequent religious meetings, and so compared to the major world religions (e.g. Christianity, Islam, Judaism), they lack a formal religion. However, they do still practice certain rituals which hold significance in their culture. The main ritual is the dance and meat eating.  Epeme  can be understood as the Hadza's concept of manhood, hunting, and the relationships between sexes. \\"True\\" adult men are called men, which they become by killing large game, usually in their early 20s. Being an comes with an advantage - only men are allowed to eat certain parts of large game animals, such as warthog, giraffe, buffalo, wildebeest, and lion. The parts of these animals that are typically considered are the kidney, lung, heart, neck, tongue, and genitals. Also, no one besides other men are allowed to be present for the meat-eating. If a man still has not killed a large game animal by his thirties, he will automatically be considered and will be allowed to eat the meat. In addition to eating meat, the men participate in an dance. This dance occurs every night when the moon isn't visible, and must occur in complete darkness. One man dances at a time, wearing a black cape, ostrich-feather headdress, and bells around his ankles, as the women watch. The man will stamp his foot to provide a beat, shake a gourd maraca, and sing. After a few rounds of this performance, the women will get up and sing and dance around the man. After one man goes, he gives the dressings to another man and the dance repeats. = Mythological figures with celestial connotations = There are some mythological figures who are believed to take part in arranging the world, for example rolling the sky and the earth like two sheets of leather and swapping their order to achieve the recent situation ‚Äì in the past the sky used to be located under the earth.Kohl-Larsen 1956a: 42‚Äì43 These figures also have made crucial decisions about the animals and humans (designating their food, environment),Kohl-Larsen 1956a: 34‚Äì35 giving people the fire and the capability of sitting.Kohl-Larsen 1956a: 42‚Äì45 These figures have celestial connotations: Ishoko is a solar figure, Haine is a lunar figure.Kohl-Larsen 1956a: 13  Ishoko (\\"sun\\")  The character \\"Ishoye\\" seems to be Ishoko.Kohl-Larsen 1956a: 226 (= note 22) She is depicted in some tales as someone who created animals, even people.Kohl-Larsen 1956a: 32‚Äì33Kohl-Larsen 1956a: 82 Her creatures included also some people who later turned out to be a disaster for their fellow people (the man-eating giant and his wife): as Ishoko saw this, she killed the man-eaters: \\"you are not people any longer\\".Kohl-Larsen 1956a: 127 Uttering Ishoko's name can mean a greeting, a good wish to someone for a successful hunt.Kohl-Larsen 1956a: 130, 227 (= note 51) Ishoko is the wife of Haine.Kohl-Larsen 1956a: 62, 227 (note 32) = Roles of a culture hero =  The man who returned from the grave to become a hero  Indaya, the man who went to the Isanzu territory after his death and returned,Kohl-Larsen 1956a: 37‚Äì38 plays the role of a culture hero: he introduces customs and goods to the Hadza.Kohl-Larsen 1956a: 14  Isanzu people  The Isanzu people neighbor the Hadza. Unlike the Iraqw and the cattle-raiding Maasai (who used to lead raids towards Isanzu and Iramba through Hadza territory), the hoe-farming Isanzu are regarded as a peaceful people by Hadza. Moreover, many goods and customs comes from them, and the Hadza myths mention and depict this benevolent influence of the Isanzu. This advantageous view about Isanzu makes the role of this people comparable to that of a culture hero in Hadza folklore.Kohl-Larsen 1956a: 13‚Äì14 Also in some of the mythical stories about giants (see below), it is an Isanzu man who liberates the Hadza from the malevolent giant. = Stories about giants = The stories about giants describe people with superhuman strength and size, but otherwise with human weaknesses (they have human needs, eat and drink, they can be poisoned or cheated).  Sengani and his brothers  One of the giants, Sengani (or Sengane), was Haine's helper, and Haine gave him power to rule over people. In Haine's absence, the giant endangered people with his decisions. The people had to resist him, thus the giant ordered the lions to attack people, which surprised people, because formerly lions were regarded as harmless beings. The people killed the giant in revenge.Kohl-Larsen 1956a: 105‚Äì110, 227 This giant had brothers, rendered \\"Ssaabo\\" and \\"Waonelakhi\\" in Kohl-Larsen. Several tales describe the disaster these giants caused to Hadza by constantly killing, beating them. The Hadza had to ask for help from neighboring groups, finally, the giants were tricked and poisoned, or shot to death by arrows treated with poison.Kohl-Larsen 1956a: 110‚Äì118, 227  Man- eating giant  A man-eating giant, rendered \\"!esengego\\" by Kohl-Larsen, and his family were killed by a benevolent snake. The snake turned out to be the remedy applied by Ishoko to liberate people. Ishoko changed the corpses of the giant family into leopards. He prohibited them to attack people, except for the case they would be provoked or wounded by an arrow.Kohl-Larsen 1956a: 125‚Äì127  !Hongongosch√°  Another giant, rendered \\"!Hongongosch√°\\" in Kohl_Larsen, played the role of a mythological figure. He did not bother the Hadza (except for some smaller thefts done secretly at night). His nourishment was flowers of trees (and stolen vegetables). People greeted him with great respect, and the giant wished them good hunting luck, which was indeed realized. The giant provided further his good will to people even after he was hurt deliberately by a boy, but he took a fatal revenge on the boy. Finally, the god Haine decided about the fate of this giant and the people: he warned people, revealed the malevolent deed of the boy, and changed the giant into a big white clam.Kohl-Larsen 1956a: 128‚Äì133, 227 See also *Aka people *Baka people *Bushmen *Bongo people *!Kung people *Mbuti people *Twa peoples Notes References   * * A film (43 min) in German about this people and their struggle for survival. * The book is a collection of Hadza myths about giants, also some tribal myths about cultural heroes, and anecdotal tales.   * This book includes descriptions of Hadza myths, culture, and modern struggles. * * Further reading   Matthiessen, Peter (1972) The Tree Where Man Was Born, Chapter X. * * External links * Hadza bibliography, Electronic Bibliography for African Languages and Linguistics * Gli ultimi primitivi.

The main plot revolves around two shop employees (portrayed by Cook and Shepard) who compete for the affection of their newest co-worker. The film was shot primarily at the Costco in Albuquerque, New Mexico located at 1420 N Renaissance Blvd NE. The film was released on October 6, 2006 and grossed $38 million. Plot For years, Zack Bradley has been working at the local \\"Super Club\\" as a box-boy. He lives with his grandmother and spends his free time with co-workers Lon Neilson, Iqbal Raji, and Russell Porpis-Gunders. Despite his slacker-like ways, he is kind- hearted, popular and supportive. His co-worker Vince Downey earns the Employee of the Month title for the 17th time in a row. Vince is egotistical and rude towards his co-workers, including his box-boy Jorge Mecico, whom he berates constantly. When new cashier Amy Renfro is hired, Zack and Vince fall for her and compete for her affection. Zack is told that Amy slept with the Employee of the Month at her last job, so he decides to win the title. Amy has dinner with Vince, but is repulsed when he puts the move on her. Vince does not realize how Amy feels, thinking they had a good kiss, and continues pursuing her. Zack steps up his act and begins going to work on time and working harder, giving Vince competition for the title. He also goes on a date with Amy, which takes place entirely in Super Club. Within a few days, with Vince still winning the daily star, Zack realizes that getting Employee of the Month is not as easy as he thought. With Iqbal's encouragement, Zack finds his groove and, to Vince's horror, wins the star the next day. A war of attrition begins, as Vince tries everything he could think of to derail Zack's string of stars, even breaking into his house one night to reset the clocks; the sabotage causes Zack to arrive a minute late the following day, but with Iqbal's help, Zack's attendance card indicates that he arrived on time, causing Vince's scheme to fail. Zack takes Iqbal's shift on the day of a championship slow-pitch game against rival chain Maxi-Mart. However, he leaves to play in the game and Iqbal is fired. Frustrated at Zack's new attitude, his friends tell him he is turning into Vince and feel his attempt at getting the title is a result of trying to have sex with Amy. Amy overhears the conversation and is disgusted at Zack for his true intentions, prompting her to compare him to her last boyfriend, also an Employee of the Month with whom she indeed had sex but could not stand his attitude, which was why she requested a transfer. At month's end, Zack and Vince are tied. On the day of the tie-breaking competition, Zack quits, gets Iqbal his job back and tells him he took responsibility for what happened, making a heartfelt apology to Lon, Iqbal, and Russell. Zack tells them he plans to win the competition, not for recognition or to make an impression, but for pride. When the store manager is about to announce Zack's resignation, Zack, Lon, Iqbal, and Russell show up claiming Zack never filed the resignation papers. It is revealed that Russell bribed the human resources manager with a Butterfinger. Zack tries to reconcile with Amy, giving a heartfelt apology and telling her that no matter what, he is a better man because of her. Despite Vince's protests, the competition, for the fastest checkout, is held. The Employee of the Month Award will be granted to the person who finishes the task first. Vince beats Zack by seconds but, during the award ceremony, Semi, the security guard, brings a surveillance video of the competition that shows Vince throwing store products behind his back and onto the conveyor belt without scanning them. The store's assistant manager, who had just completed an audit of the tills used in the competition, proves the tape was accurate and adds that Vince had been under-ringing for the past 18 months, costing the store thousands of dollars. Vince is fired and Zack ends up winning the competition, as well as rekindling his relationship with Amy. Six weeks after being fired from Super Club, Vince is on probation and working at Maxi-Mart. Jorge finally learns to assert himself and treats Vince the same as he was treated by him. He is still willing to give Vince a ride to the bus stop, knowing that this would put him outside the range of his probation ankle monitor.

After Doomsday is a science fiction novel by American writer Poul Anderson. It was published as a complete novel in 1962, having been serialized as The Day after Doomsday in the magazine Galaxy, between December 1961 and February 1962. Plot introduction The novel explores events after the destruction of Earth, from the point of view of two returning starship crews, one entirely made up of men, the other consisting entirely of women. The story is set in the early 21st century. Even as the Cold War dragged on, Earth has been suddenly contacted by the Monwaingi space-faring culture. The technology of interstellar travel is spreading across the galaxy, disrupting one culture after another. Monwaing itself was contacted only a few centuries previously. Another culture, the Vorlak, underwent a transition from a stable planetary society to a warlord culture similar to the Japanese Shogunate. The nomadic Kandemirian culture became a hegemonistic one similar to the Mongol Empire. Earth found itself on the fringes of a conflict between Kandemir and a coalition led by Vorlak, with Monwaing on the sidelines, actively supporting the anti-Kandemir forces. There is a lingua franca called Uru, which bonds the diverse cultures together. The original speakers of the language may have also initiated the spread of interstellar technology, but the language seems to have outlived, or at least outstripped its originators. In the 20 years since contact, several expeditions have set out, some in borrowed ships, some in ships built on Earth. The ship USS Benjamin Franklin, with an all-male crew, set out to visit the core of the Milky Way -- actually an unusual quest by the stodgy standards of the typical galactic culture. Another ship has gone as far as the Magellanic Clouds. The pan-European expedition in the ship Europa, crewed entirely by women, has roamed far outside the local group of cultures. The star-drive technology allows journeys of tens of thousands of parsecs in mere months. In spite of this, most cultures are \\"stay-at-homes\\" compared to humans, interacting only with the local group of cultures, known as a \\"cluster\\". Now the Franklin and the Europa return to find that Earth has suffered the ultimate disaster. Plot summary =Ragnarok= The USS Benjamin Franklin, a starship crewed entirely by men returns to Earth, to find the planet consumed by eruptions from within the crust. All life is gone, along with the few outposts of humanity on the Moon and artificial satellites. Missiles lurk throughout the Solar System, ready to destroy returning ships. Unable to leave a message drone because of the missiles, Franklin flees to Tau Ceti. Discipline breaks down, the captain is killed, and a nucleus of a new crew forms behind a man named Carl Donnan. Donnan is an engineer and adventurer who gave up wandering the Earth for a chance to see the galaxy, courtesy of a Senator who owed him a favor. Now he is leading almost 300 men on a quest for other humans, and for Earth's murderers. Chief suspects are the Kandemirians, especially since the missiles swarming through the Solar System are Kandemirian. Earth is new to interstellar trade, and a handful of ships have gone out into the wider galactic society. The men realize they have little hope of finding other humans, let alone women. They do have a guide with them, an alien called Ramri from the polycultural society originating on the planet Monwaing. Ramri is a biped descended from feathered, bird-like creatures. Some time afterwards, the ship Europa with a crew of 100 women returns, to find Earth destroyed and missiles roaming the Solar System. They are able to disable one missile. A small team boards the missile, including Navigation Officer Sigrid Holmen and her friend Gunnery Officer Alexandra Vukovic. The missile appears to have been manufactured by Kandemirians, although there are symbols in an unknown script scrawled on a bulkhead within it. Other missiles approach, and the Europa must leave without addressing the central mystery. The officers confer about where to go next. =The Quests= Travelling to Vorlak, Donnan sells the crew's services to the warlord, or Draga, Hlott Luurs. His proposition is that the humans will develop new technology allowing a ship to detect the drives of other ships far beyond the usual range. Donnan's friend Arnold Goldspring is a mathematician who has a host of new ideas for the technology. The detector is just the first one. To prove its worth, Donnan bargains for a Vorlak ship which they will use on a stealth raid on a Kandemirian outpost. The raid is a disaster, and they are captured by Kandemirians. Interrogated by the head of the Kandemirian forces, Tarkamat, Donnan is told that if he refuses to re-create the technology for Kandemir, his crew will die horribly, one by one. He has no choice but to comply. The crew of the Europa travel far beyond the boundaries of the local cluster to one with a vibrant capitalist economy. At Sigrid Holmen's suggestion, they set themselves up as \\"Terran Traders Inc.\\" and proceed to amass wealth, hoping to be able to buy or charter ships to search for survivors of Earth. Sigrid is kidnapped by representatives of a rival trader culture, the Forsi, who resemble heavyset gnomes. The Forsi want to take her away to study, determined to discover why \\"Terran Traders Inc.\\" is able to be so successful. She is in the process of attempting escape from them when Alexandra Vukovic, a former urban guerrilla, tracks her down and uses her skills to eliminate Sigrid's captors. =Earth's suicide?= Donnan's crew, laboring on one of the Kandemirians' subject planets, are being carefully monitored to make sure they only work on the drive detection device. However, the monitoring of the material making up the chassis of the device is less stringent, and they are able to create a dummy copy of a common soldier's rifle from seemingly unrelated parts. With this they bluff their way out of confinement, capture real weapons, and eventually steal a starship. The price of this escape is the loss of a suicide squad who hold off the local troops long enough for Donnan, Goldspring, Ramri and the rest to take off. Ramri takes them to his homeworld, Katkinu. Like many Monwaing worlds, this has different and apparently incompatible cultures living side by side. The official Representative of the homeworld on Katkinu is from the Laothaung culture. Unlike Ramri's culture, this one uses biotechnology efficiently and ruthlessly. Specialized lifeforms, designed to have just enough intelligence to do work, and subservient to the rulers, carry out all labor. There are even altered types of Monwaingi being used as slaves. In the Representative's office they are shown a recording of an interrogation of an agent of the merchant culture of Xo. It indicates that Earth was destroyed by bombs sold to two of the minor national powers, and set up as a suicide weapon, to be detonated if either power was attacked with nuclear weapons. =The Battle of Brandobar= The men are shocked, but are still determined to fight on against the Kandemirians. Returning to Vorlak, Donnan bluffs his way past Hlott Luurs, who is still angry over the loss of a ship and his kinsman aboard it. Goldspring has designed more weapons using the stardrive technology. The basis of the drive is that space is a standing wave pattern. Where interference fringes occur, there is in effect no space and no distance. A ship may jump from fringe to fringe and travel from star to star in a short time. The new devices manufacture artificial fringes. With this they are able to distort space-time inside enemy ships, disabling missiles, inducing small thermonuclear explosions, and producing coherent sound waves. This last weapon lets them administer the coup de gr√¢ce to the Kandemirian fleet, broadcasting a message which demoralizes the crews, at the same time encouraging the subject races in the Empire to revolt. After the victory, the news, in the form of a carefully crafted minstrel song, spreads around the galaxy. The song, in Uru, has the title \\"The Battle of Brandobar\\", and describes the final battle in a series of quatrains. A chapter of the novel is dedicated to a scholarly analysis of the song, teasing out both the story of the song and the calculated structure of the verses, designed to resist alteration as the song spreads from one singer to another along the trade routes. It is through this song that the crew of the Europa, via their trade connections, learn where the USS Benjamin Franklin went. =Reunion -- and the awful truth= Once the two crews are united, apart from the obvious considerations, they must decide who destroyed the Earth. The men still believe it was the Kandemirians, with the trader story being disinformation. When they decode the symbols the women found, they realize the truth. It is a base 12 to 6 conversion table to help technicians reprogram the weapons. The missiles are Kandemirian, but the script is Monwaingi. One of the many different Monwaingi societies, possibly the ruthless biotech Laothaung culture, wanted the Earth and saw fit to cleanse it before colonizing with their own biota. Ramri leaves for his home planet, determined to purge the culture that committed the crime, but aware that his own world might well be destroyed in the process. Carl Donnan and Sigrid Holmen can only look at each other and say \\"What have we done?\\" Characters  *Carl Donnan *Ramri, a bird-descended biped with brilliant blue feathers. He is a product of the high-technology Tantha culture who believe in trade with other cultures. As a Monwaingi representative on Earth, he is enraptured by human culture and its arts. He is particularly taken by human music, especially Beethoven. Despite his size and a somewhat delicate appearance, he is a willing fighter, and wields talons on his clawed feet. *Arnold Goldspring, the Detector Officer on the USS Benjamin Franklin. A mathematician, he is able to re-invent the \\"paragravitic standing wave\\" technology behind interstellar travel to create new and revolutionary weapons. *Sigrid Holmen, the Navigation Officer on the Europa. Tall, blonde, and Swedish, she is a stoic figure who has to control her grief over the loss of her beloved country, its forests, waters and people, and keep going forward in the hope that humanity might continue. *Alexandra Vukovic, the Gunnery Officer on the Europa and Sigrid's best friend. She is a Serb and a graduate of \\"the Soviet incursion of 1995\\". This event turned her into a guerilla, a staunch friend, and a habitual rebel. *Hlott Luurs, a Draga or warlord of the Vorlak, a race of bipeds of about the same size as humans, but resembling otters in the head shape and in the possession of a coat of fur. Hlott Luurs is the head of the Draga Council by virtue of support from a coalition of other Draga. Like the other Draga he is pugnacious, proud, quick to take offense, but bound by a code of honor, which Donnan uses to his advantage. *Tarkamat of Kandemir, the military leader for the entire campaign against the Vorlak-led forces. After Donnan and his raiders are captured, he personally interrogates Donnan in his luxurious quarters. Like all Kandemirians, Tarkamat is well over 2 meters tall, handsome by human standards, a broad-shouldered and narrow- waisted biped with a ruff of hair framing the face. His officers and other soldiers are also members of his clan, a typical Kandmirian arrangement.

He provided the FBI, who code-named him \\"Wahoo\\" because of his Native American heritage, with information relating to John Gotti and other members of the Gambino family. Johnson was a friend of Gambino crime boss John Gotti even though Johnson was informing on him.  Early life  Johnson was born in Canarsie, Brooklyn, one of five children of a part Native American father, John Johnson, and an Italian-American mother. His parents had settled in Red Hook, Brooklyn, where Wilfred Johnson was raised with his brothers and sisters. He was known on the streets as \\"Indian\\". Johnson's father, John, was an abusive alcoholic who frequently beat his wife and children and spent his entire paycheck on alcohol. Johnson's mother would periodically desert her husband and children, only to return later. This dysfunctional and vicious childhood helped mold Johnson into a criminal. He was referred to as a \\"half breed\\" in reference to his mixed Italian-Lenape heritage and Cher's song \\"Half-Breed\\". Johnson's criminal career began when he was only nine years old; he was arrested for stealing money out of a Helen's Candy Store cash register, a Murder, Inc. mob hangout. Johnson's school life was quite traumatic as well. The boy had a hair-trigger temper that frequently got him into trouble. At age 12, Johnson either fell or was pushed off the school roof during a fight. As a result of this accident, Johnson sustained head injuries that would plague him with persistent headaches for the rest of his life.  Entry into organized crime  As a young man, Johnson was physically imposing. Allan May, quoting from the memoir of Retired Lieutenant Remo Franceschini of the Queens District Attorney's Squad, describes Johnson thusly: > He was real stocky, about five feet nine inches and well over two hundred > pounds, looked like a professional wrestler. Size twenty-one neck, gravel > voice. You didn't want to meet Willie Boy on the street, and if you met him > you'd better have backup ammunition in your pocket because six bullets were > not going to stop this guy. He was the type of guy who, if he got shot, he > would almost try to rip the bullets out of his own chest and then get really > pissed off. 'You shot me? Now you're in f‚Äîkin' trouble.' This led Johnson to become a Mafia enforcer. By 1949, he was running a gang of thugs in East New York who strong-armed debtors into paying their mob debts. In 1957, Johnson met John Gotti for the first time. Gotti was a 17-year-old high school dropout and Johnson was a street thug perpetually in trouble with the law. When Gotti joined the Gambino family, Johnson came with him. Johnson became known as the \\"terminator\\" because of his skill with strong-arm work. Requiring a steady income, Johnson was given a modestly successful gambling operation. Because Johnson was only half-Italian from the wrong side of the family, he could never become a made man. However, he brought in money as well as anyone else in the family. Johnson married an Italian woman and never had a mistress. In Johnson's mind, he was part of the family. Cooperation with the FBI In the late 1960s, Johnson, the loyal soldier, would turn against his crime family. This betrayal started in 1966, when Johnson was imprisoned for armed robbery. His caporegime, Carmine Fatico, vowed to financially support Johnson's wife and two infant children but soon broke this promise. Johnson's wife, who remained loyal to Johnson throughout all his prison terms, was forced to go on welfare. Johnson felt the mob was not living up to its obligations. Wilfred rarely volunteered information but would answer direct questions asked by law enforcement officials. His FBI handler, Special Agent Martin Boland, would submit questions from various organized crime squads inside the FBI and the DEA. In 1967, during an FBI interview, someone spotted Johnson's apparent dissatisfaction with the mob. After his release from prison, the FBI approached him about becoming an informant. Reluctant at first, Johnson finally agreed to talk in return for the government's dropping some counterfeiting charges. Johnson also wanted to pay back the Gambinos for their dishonesty. In 1978, Johnson informed Boland about the whereabouts of Lucchese crime family capo, Paul Vario's, hijacking headquarters, which at the time was operating out of a scrapyard owned by Clyde Brooks. Although he was an informant, Wilfred customarily was careful about discussing his friend John Gotti. Johnson had a curious relationship with Gotti, and at one point remarked to Boland, \\"Sometimes I love him, and sometimes I hate him\\". Johnson did not provide much elaboration except for occasional hints, among them complaints about Gotti's gambling addiction, which often involved, the informant said, bets of up to $100,000 a week. Some of that action, Johnson complained, would be laid off at his modest bookmaking operation, forcing Johnson to absorb the loss. On other occasions, Johnson would say bitterly about Gotti, \\"You know, he wears these expensive suits now, but he's still a lot of bullshit; he's still a mutt. Don't be fooled by that smooth exterior\\". Underlying Johnson's bitterness was apparent resentment over his continuing lowly status in Carmine Fatico's crew, a state of permanent inferiority, despite Johnson's loyal service. Johnson resented how Fatico and Gotti always treated him like a peon: \\"They still see me as a gofer and make me handle swag\\". Except for $100 Johnson once borrowed from Boland as an \\"emergency personal loan\\" which was promptly paid back and on which Boland declined an offer of \\"vig\\", Wilfred did not receive any financial compensation from the FBI. He did, however, make some profit; his information solved a number of major hijackings for the FBI, and in cases where insurance companies offered large rewards for recovery of stolen goods, the FBI provided confidential affidavits attesting that Johnson was directly responsible for recovery of hijacked goods. Johnson collected the rewards, in one case $30,000 for the recovery of a large shipment. As an informant, Johnson did not seek, as many do, intervention by the FBI to get criminal charges reduced or dropped, aside from the aforementioned counterfeiting charges. Career as informant During his 16 years as an informant, Johnson provided information on all the different New York Mafia crews that he worked with, and the FBI used that information to make many arrests. However, as his FBI handler, Special Agent Martin Boland, noticed, Johnson refused to discuss his background or childhood in any detail. One of the most significant pieces of information provided by Johnson was how The Vario Crew was avoiding FBI wiretaps and bugs. The crew was using a parked trailer in a junkyard owned by Paul Vario in Brooklyn. Johnson also provided the FBI with information on a largescale narcotics ring, run by John Gotti and others, called the \\"Pleasant Avenue Connection\\"; revealed that Gotti and Angelo Ruggerio had murdered Florida mobster Anthony Plate; and gave details on the murder of James McBratney, the man who kidnapped Emanuel Gambino. Exposure In 1985, Johnson's career as an informant came to an abrupt end. In a public hearing that year, Federal prosecutor Diane Giacalone revealed that Johnson was working for the FBI, in an attempt to convince him to plea bargain and testify against Gotti. Johnson's FBI handlers tried to convince him to enter the Witness Protection Program, but for an unknown reason, he refused. This led to a breakdown in already strained relations between the FBI and Giacalone and led the FBI to cease involvement in the Gotti case, which led to an acquittal. Murder  On August 29, 1988, Bonanno family hit men, Thomas Pitera and Vincent \\"Kojak\\" Giattino, ambushed Wilfred \\"Willie Boy\\" Johnson in front of his Brooklyn home as he walked to his car and shot him to death. The gunmen fired 19 rounds at him. Johnson was hit once in each thigh, twice in the back, and at least six times in the head. The hit team then dropped jack-like caltrops on the street to prevent the possibility of pursuit. Pitera had done this as a favor to Gotti.{see \\"The Butcher: Anatomy of a Mafia Psychopath\\" Philip Carlo, author pages 192-195} In 1992, Pitera and Giattino were indicted and tried for Johnson's murder. Giattino was found guilty. Pitera was acquitted, but was later convicted of six other murders. Interment Johnson is interred at St. John Cemetery in Middle Village, Queens, NY.

The main purpose was to switch chemical cars for Pittsburgh Plate Glass, Babcox and Wilcox Companies as well as O.C. Barber's match works, all in Barberton. It was controlled by the Akron, Canton and Youngstown, Baltimore and Ohio, Pennsylvania and Erie railroads. It interchanged railroad cars with the Erie Railroad in Barberton, Pennsylvania RR in Barberton and Akron, Akron Canton & Youngstown at East Akron and Belt Junction west of Fairlawn and the Baltimore & Ohio RR in East Akron and Barberton. The railroad was always a freight-only carrier. The East Akron line ran south of Barberton before curving back north, passing through Kenmore, South Akron, East Akron and ending at the Akron Canton and Youngstown Railroad Brittian Yard in far Eastern Akron. The Fairlawn line ran due north from Barberton, connection with the Akron Canton and Youngstown Railroad at Belt Junction just west of Fairlawn. The three-track interchange yard at Belt Junction was out of service for many years during the 1920s and 1930s due to damage but was used by the Akron Canton and Youngstown Railroad to hold overflow cars from the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing plant just east of Copley. The interchange was restored around World War II. From 1942 to 1972, the ABB pulled their trains with four Baldwin switching locomotives. Prior to that they operated several 0-6-0 engines based on Pennsylvania Railroad designs, a 2-6-0 and another 0-6-0 switcher. The Pennsylvania-designed engines had \\"doghouses\\" on their tenders for crew members as the railroad did not use cabooses until the 1940s. In 1964, they purchased an additional ALCO RS-3 locomotive from the Pennsylvania Railroad. These worn-out locomotives were scrapped in 1972 when the railroad began using leased motive power from Precision National Corporation. On many occasions, the Belt would lease from the four owners, most notably the N&W.; This lasted until October 1982 when two EMD SW1500 locomotives were purchased from Conrail. These two units make the motive power on the current system. In 1984, PPG industries in Barberton closed up most of their operations and ABB lost 65% of their business. However, luck turned around in 1985, when they acquired Conrail trackage in Rittman and gained access to the Morton Salt and Packaging Corporation of America factories. In 1994 the railroad was a sold to the Akron Barberton Cluster Railway which in turn is owned by the Wheeling and Lake Erie Railway. The line from Firestone Park to the W&LE;'s Britain yard in east Akron were taken soon after along with the line north from Barberton to Belt Junction in Fairlawn where a connection was made with the Akron Canton & Youngstown RR, also an industrial branch line in Barberton. Much of the main yard was rebuilt in 2005 to make room for the new Robinson Ave. viaduct. Its main traffic includes plastic pellets for Landmark Plastics and Rubbermaid. There is a coal train three times a week and the railroad brings comics to the Akron Beacon Journal. (Newsprint delivery by rail was ceased in 2009. The spur off of the CSX main and all trackage to the Beacon Journal has been removed.) The (tracks themselves are owned by Akron METRO which also runs the Transit Agency. Future plans are to attract more industry and rebuild the Erie Lackawanna line for freight and passenger service to Kent State University. (METRO owns only the former Erie line from Akron to Kent, and is inoperable at this time (2011).) The only former Erie line that ABCR runs on is from Kent, and Barberton, OH to Rittman, OH.

Sherman Stow's son, state senator Edgar Whitney Stow, set up a research laboratory at the ranch and developed disease resistant lemon rootstock of great value to local growers. The earliest commercial irrigation in the area took place on the ranch using the pond created by the Stows. The pond was expanded to create Lake Los Carneros which remains within the park. Museum The house museum displays family photographs and furniture, with stories of Sherman and Ida Stow and their descendants.

A former boomtown of the 1870s and the era of the Hudson's Bay Company steamship trade, the community has now all but virtually disappeared. An unincorporated community, it was designated as part of the U.S. Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program on March 31, 2010. It was not counted separately during the 2000 Census, but was included in the 2010 Census, where a population of 39 was reported. History First called Goose River, the community was established as a post for the Hudson's Bay Company steamships which operated on the Red River of the North. Caledonia became an early boom town in the Red River Valley and also became a post for a stagecoach line which lead north to Fort Garry ‚Äî now called Winnipeg. Upon the creation of Traill County in 1875, Caledonia was designated as the county seat. However, in that same year, the Hudson's Bay Company closed their U.S. posts including the one at Caledonia. When James J. Hill's railroad crossed Traill County, it bypassed Caledonia. The steamboat industry soon floundered and the county seat was moved to Hillsboro in 1896. Geography Caledonia sits on the banks of the Goose River near the confluence with the Red River of the North.

Development was discontinued following an unexplained accident on 10 April 1950, and the contest, for which the design was intended, was eventually rendered moot when the A√©ronavale adopted the de Havilland Sea Venom in 1952. Design and development Conceived as a single-seat, carrier-borne fighter for the French Navy, the NC.1080 competed for this role against the Arsenal VG 90 and Nord 2200. The project was funded directly by SNCAC, and was directed by engineer Germain Pillon. The NC.1080 was fitted with a Rolls-Royce Nene turbojet, and was designed to be capable of carrying three 30mm cannon. It was a low-wing monoplane of all-metal construction. On 29 July 1949, the aircraft had its first test flight, during which issues were noted regarding two control surfaces: the spoilers and tailplane. While SNCAC was dissolved that same year, further testing of the prototype was carried out by the French military at Br√©tigny and Villaroche air bases. During a test flight on 10 April 1950, with Pierre Gallay at the controls, the plane crashed for unknown reasons. It was damaged beyond repair. Consequently, further development of the design was immediately halted. Specifications References * Green, W. & Swanborough, G. (1994). The Complete Book of Fighters. London: Salamander Books.

Since the Chaga people are Bantu speakers, the adopted language contains dialects similar to that of the Kenyan language Kamba. Gweno shares about 54% to 56% of its vocabulary with other Chaga dialects and 46% with Taita dialects. However, a large percentage of its vocabulary is not seen in the other dialects. Also at the start of the 11th century, the Chaga people descended and migrated from the Bantu group in which they migrated to the foothills of mount Kilimanjaro. The Gweno language is today spoken mostly by older adults, with younger generations having shifted to Asu and Swahili. Ethnologue considers Gweno to be moribund; the language is not being passed down because children have not been exposed to Gweno since the 1970s. The generational shift from Gweno to either Asu or Swahili has certainly created shifts in dialect, however Gweno speakers do not see this as a threat.

He was known as \\"Alberto\\", \\"The Doctor\\", the \\"King of Wall Street\\" and \\"The Italian Meyer Lansky\\". By the end of his criminal career, Lombardozzi was the biggest earner for the Gambino family. Biography =Background= Carmine Lombardozzi was born in Brooklyn on December 8, 1913 to Camillo Lombardozzi and Annunziata Antonelli. Carmine's six brothers were John, Daniel, Paul, Cosmo, Dominick, and youngest brother Anthony (Sonny) Lombardozzi. He had three sisters, Edith, Mary, and Jenny. Lombardozzi's first wife was Mary Corrolla. After being married to Corrolla for 29 years, Lombardozzi had an affair with the young daughter of Stabato Muro, a Profaci mobster. When Muro complained to the family leadership, Lombardozzi was forced to divorce Corrolla and marry Muro. He had a stepdaughter, Renee Lombardozzi. His nephews included Daniel Marino and George Lombardozzi, both of whom eventually joined the Gambino crime family.Carl Sifakis, The Mafia Encyclopedia, (Facts on File, 2005), p.271 Lombardozzi was six feet tall, but tended to hunch over and look shorter. He was described as having a high strung temperament, always watching for threats around him. A wealthy man, Lombardozzi owned a Rolls-Royce automobile, a yacht, and a waterfront mansion in Mill Basin, Brooklyn. =Gambino mobster= Lombardozzi, though only a caporegime (captain), allegedly ran the entire Gambino shylock and stock market rackets. He was involved in loansharking and racketeering, and was said to have earned the Gambino crime family a lot of money during his criminal career. Considered a traditional mafiosi, Lombardozzi was described as having a \\"brilliant mind\\" for numbers. In November 1957, new Genovese crime family boss Vito Genovese called a meeting of high-ranking Cosa Nostra figures at the farm home of mobster Joseph Barbara in Apalachin, New York. Lombardozzi attended the meeting. According to some sources, Lombardozzi was in serious trouble with Cosa Nostra leaders over mishandling of funds. They privately discussed murdering him, but old friend Joseph Profaci, boss of the Profaci crime family, dissuaded them. Soon after the meeting started, New York State Troopers raided the farm and arrested dozens of mobsters, including Lombardozzi. When questioned by law enforcement, Lombardozzi said he had come to Apalachin to go hunting. When asked why he didn't have any hunting equipment, Lombardozzi said he was planning to buy it there. For failing to cooperate in the investigation of the infamous Apalachin Meeting, Lombardozzi spent 14 months in prison. On November 30, 1964, Lombardozzi was sentenced to 30 days in jail for contempt of court; Lombardozzi had repeatedly dodged questions about a jewelry scam committed by his brother. In 1963, Daniel Marino and other Gambino associates assaulted a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agent at the funeral of Lombardozzi's father. Although Lombardozzi was not involved in the attack, the family leadership blamed him for his nephew's poor judgement. On August 27, 1965, Lombardozzi was arrested for assaulting a police officer. Police had tried to arrest him in a Brooklyn restaurant but Lombardozzi punched a detective in the face, starting a brawl that involved a female companion and several bystanders. On March 18, 1969, Lombardozzi was sentenced to one year in prison on contempt charges for refusing to discuss mob involvement with legitimate businesses before a grand jury. While serving this prison sentence, doctors were forced to remove one of Lombardozzi's kidneys due to cancer. On June 12, 1970, Lombardozzi was sentenced to two years in prison for conspiring to cash $50,000 in stolen brokerage checks. Three months after the check-cashing trial, Lombardozzi was back in court facing two counts of attempting to defraud the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. The crime involved the illegal cashing of winning tickets from Yonkers Raceway in Yonkers, New York, and what was then Roosevelt Raceway in Westbury, New York. In September 1970, Lombardozzi's co-defendant was found guilty on one of the two charges, but the jury acquitted Lombardozzi on one count and declared themselves unable to reach a verdict on the other. On November 20, 1975, Lombardozzi was indicted on 17 counts of perjury based on his previous grand jury testimony about loansharking and arson-for-hire schemes. Investigator used electronic surveillance to record Lombardozzi's conversations at a motel and diner in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn. On one occasion, the listening device fell from the bottom of the diner table to the floor next to Lombardozzi's feet. However, an undercover policeman went to the table and claimed he had lost his pager. An unsuspecting Lombardozzi handed the device to the detective. On April 16, 1981, Lombardozzi was indicted on charges of failing to report his loansharking income in his federal income tax returns. His headquarters for this racket was a Kiwanis clubhouse in Mill Basin, Brooklyn. He used to meet with Salvatore Stagnitta Lombardozzi and his brother Cosmo were close friends of 'Mr Stan', the notorious Serbian criminal Vojislav Stanimirovic responsible for the Vizcaya heist. This connection with the rare non-Italian businessman was Lombardozzi's entry to New York's Diamond District. He was a mentor to the Serbian authority's son Pavle Stanimiroviƒá. Fruitless recording efforts by the FBI yielded much discussion of activities that weren't illegal; Lombardozzi prized his Rolls-Royce and wine cellar, though not in that order. 'The Doctor' was considered a class act and Italian elder statesman. With friends and family he avoided the subject of crime but told tales of mafia legends like Lucky Luciano, Meyer Lansky, and his own experience at Apalachin. On April 16, 1981, Lombardozzi was indicted on charges of failing to report his loansharking income in his federal income tax returns. He was convicted and sentenced to six months in prison. =Death= On May 10, 1992, Carmine Lombardozzi died at home of heart failure at age 79.

More than 21,000 students annually take courses for credit toward a certificate or degree at the college. The college employs more than 1,600 people, including 138 full-time and 511 part-time instructors and 277 students. History and governance Edmonds Community College was established on July 1, 1967, and is governed by the Washington State Board of Community and Technical Colleges. It is accredited by the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities. The Board of Trustees of Edmonds Community College was composed of five members appointed by the governor of Washington, until July 1, 2013, when a sixth member representing students was appointed by the governor. Each member serves a five-year term, except the student representative, who serves a one-year term, and all must reside within the college's district boundaries. The board, on behalf of the citizens of College District No. 23, ensures the accountability of Edmonds Community College. In 1967, the state legislature separated community colleges from the common schools and created 22 community college districts, including District 5 for Everett and Edmonds Community Colleges. Governor Daniel J. Evans in May 1967 appointed a five-member board of trustees for District 5 to administer the operations of the already existing Everett Junior College and the new Edmonds Community College. In June 1967, the trustees established a district administrative structure with Dr. Paul McCurley, President of Everett CC, as the district president and district offices were located at Paine Field in 1968. On July 1, 2013, the governor appointed the college's first student trustee, John Jessop, to a one-year term. Byron Norman was named acting president of the college on July 5, 1967. Other presidents of the college in succeeding years have been Dr. Carleton Opgaard (1968‚Äì69, 1995‚Äì96), Dr. James Warren, Thomas Nielsen, Dr.(in higher education and community college administration) Jack Oharah (1996-2010), Dr.(in Educational Leadership & Policy Studies) Jean Hernandez (2011-2017), and Dr.(in economics) Amit Singh (June 2018-). The Edmonds CC Board of Trustees removed Nielsen as president on May 23, 1995, after he was accused of accepting kickbacks and bribes; he accepted a $49,700 contract buyout on November 1, 1995, and later pleaded guilty to bribery and income-tax fraud, receiving a two-year prison sentence. Formal dedication ceremonies were held September 7, 1967, with Senator Henry M. Jackson as the featured speaker. The college is located on in Lynnwood, the site of a former military installation, the Northwest Relay and Radio Receiving Station, U.S. Army. The property was declared surplus by the U.S. Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare and transferred to Edmonds Community College on December 6, 1967. Other parts of the originally site were transferred to the Edmonds School District, the U.S. Post Office and Snohomish County. Classes began in the fall of 1967 in leased space at Woodway High School, now Edmonds Woodway High School and the college used portable buildings at the college property while permanent buildings were being constructed. Two duplex buildings built in 1941 as part of the old Army Relay Station remained on campus until the late 2010s. A plaque at the northeast entrance to Alderwood Hall on the college campus commemorates the former site of the Globe Wireless Radio Station. It was dedicated by the Edmonds‚ÄìSouth Snohomish County Historical Society. The radio station was built in 1930 and was operated by the U.S. Army and the Alaska Communication System to provide service to Alaska during World War II. The college's first buildings, the duplexes, were called \\"A\\" and \\"B\\" until the college began a tradition of naming buildings after local areas. What is now known as the Mountlake Terrace Hall was the first building constructed for the college campus in 1970. The building was renovated in 2006. The college's student newspaper, The Triton Review, was originally called The Quagmire (due to the muddy campus in the early days of the college). The first graduate of Edmonds Community College was Susan Blackborn, 19, the class of '68 (she was the only graduate that year). Don Wick was the first elected student body president at Edmonds Community College. He was named a Distinguished Alumni of the college by the Edmonds Community College Foundation in 2002 and became the Executive Director of the Economic Development Association of Skagit County. Edmonds Community College has partnered with Central Washington University to provide bachelor's degrees locally since 1975. Accounting and business administration were the first programs offered at the Lynnwood Center. The school now offers eight bachelor's degrees and one master's program. The opening of Snoqualmie Hall in 2002 gave Central a permanent presence on campus. Edmonds Community College became a single-district college on July 1, 1981, when the legislature approved the new District 23 for Edmonds Community College (which shared boundaries with the Edmonds School District, an explanation for why the college is named \\"Edmonds,\\" although it has a Lynnwood address). The college's name was shortened to Edmonds College in April 2020 to reflect the availability of four-year degree programs. Campus Mukilteo Hall with classrooms and a theater opened in 2008. The college has a campus in Lynnwood, north of Seattle and adjacent to Edmonds. The campus includes 28 computer labs, nine science labs, three eateries, two greenhouses, a digital recording studio, an art gallery, a theater, a child care center, Seaview gym, Triton Field, a transit center, Rainier Place (an on-campus residence hall), and a university satellite center for Central Washington University. Academics The college offers one bachelor of applied science degree, 64 associate degrees and 63 professional certificates in 25 programs of study. Its highest enrolled programs are the Associate of Arts/Associate of Science degrees, Paralegal, Allied Health (pre-nursing degree), Business/Accounting, Construction Management, and Computer Information Systems programs. In 2017 the college was approved to offer a Bachelor of Applied Science degree in Child, Youth, and Family Studies, its first bachelor's degree program. The college has unique Materials Science Technology and Restoration Horticulture degree programs. =Service-learning= Established in 2003, the college's service-learning program serves more than 600 students and provides 11,500 hours of service in the community to 100 campus and community partners each year. Programs include the AmeriCorps Retention Project (which works with TRiO Student Support Services, the Learn and Serve Environmental Anthropology Field (LEAF) School, and Adult Basic Education ESL programs at the college). The Center for Service-Learning has been recognized nationally with a Howard R. Swearer Student Humanitarian Award from Campus Compact and a Service-Learning Collaboration Award from the Community College National Center for Community Engagement.  Grants and research  From 1999 to 2012, the college received 20 National Science Foundation grants the first of which provided scholarships to low-income students studying computer science, engineering, and math. A subsequent NSF grant established a National Resource Center for Materials Technology Education to study ways to increase the recruitment of women and girls in science, technology, engineering, and mathematic STEM fields. In 1998, when the college hired its first grant writer (a temporary position initially funded by the Edmonds Community College Foundation), the college generated revenues of $9.5 million in grants and contracts. That number grew to $22.3 million in 2009. Today, the college's grants and contracts program makes up 24 percent of its operating budget, a larger proportion than at any other community college in the state. Athletics The college fields seven athletic teams as part of the Northern Region of the Northwest Athletic Conference (NWAC) with volleyball, men's and women's soccer, men's and women's basketball, women's softball, and baseball. Overall, Triton athletic programs have a rich and storied history, amassing 11 NWAC Championships and 55 North Region titles. The college's baseball team has won eight NWAC championships; 2014 is their most recent title. The four outdoor sports all practice and play their home games at Triton Field, which is an on-campus multi-sport field turf complex that was renovated in 2011 for over $2.5 million. The 4,860 square foot indoor hitting facility sits on the west edge of Triton Field and has two 70-foot cages, two 35-foot batting cages, and a player's lounge and lockers. Two indoor turf pitching mounds were built in 2013. The three indoor sports compete in Seaview Gymnasium (capacity 900), which is over 14,200 square feet and includes a weight room, aerobics room, instructional classroom, men's and women's locker rooms for students, men's and women's locker rooms for staff and faculty, and a small conference room. Physical Education classes are conducted in the athletic facilities - Edmonds Community College still requires PE/Health classes to be passed to obtain your associate degree. Three individuals and one team have been inducted into the NWAC Hall of Fame to date: George Smith (former athletic director and longtime Vice President of Student Services), Keith Kingsbury (men's basketball coach), Janet Guenther (championship volleyball and softball coach), 1998 NWAC Championship baseball team (set NWAC records for home runs, 7 players off the team were selected in MLB draft). = Baseball = 69 baseball players have been drafted from Edmonds CC, including Don Long who is the current hitting coach for the Cincinnati Reds. The most recent player drafted was Zach Needham by the Seattle Mariners (2017) in the 40th round. The program has a reputation for moving players and coaches on to four-year colleges and universities as well. Former baseball coach Donnie Marbut later became head baseball coach at Washington State University from 2005-2015. Marbut's 2002 NWAC Championship team was inducted into the Triton Baseball Hall of Fame in 2016. The college also has intramural athletics. There is also a full sized golf course owned by the City of Lynnwood adjacent to the campus. Spencer Stark, the current Athletics Director, joined the college in 2012.

At age 17 in 1944, he joined the Stamps-Baxter Quartet. Payne was also a member of the Lester Stamps Quartet, The Stamps All- Stars, and The Stamps-Ozark Quartet. In 1956, he joined The Weatherford Quartet, which featured Glen, Earl and Lily Fern Weatherford, Armond Morales, and George Younce. Younce was later replaced by Henry Slaughter. Work In 1963, Weatherfords members Glen, Bobby Clark, and Danny Koker departed to work for evangelist Rex Humbard at the Cathedral of Tomorrow in Akron, Ohio. Together, they formed the Cathedral Trio. With the addition of bass singer George Younce a year later, the Cathedral Trio became the Cathedral Quartet. The Cathedrals immediately became a sensation with their smooth quartet sound. Over the next 36 years, the Cathedrals won numerous Singing News Fan Awards and had several number one hits on the Southern Gospel Charts including Step into The Water, Boundless Love, and He Made a Change. While the quartet saw several different people hold the tenor, baritone and pianist positions, Payne and Younce remained the guiding forces of the quartet until Glen's death in 1999 during the Cathedral's farewell retirement tour. Payne and Younce were the only lead and bass singers the Cathedrals ever had. During the 1970s, the Cathedrals were regulars on Sunday Morning Television appearing on \\"The Gospel Singing Jubilee\\" and also appeared in several Billy Graham Crusades. They also appeared on NBC's \\"Today\\" show. During the 1990s, the Cathedrals were regulars on the \\"Gaither Homecoming\\" videos and were generally recognized as the top quartet in Southern Gospel music. Glen was the willing \\"target\\" of many of MC George's jokes and icebreakers during the quartet's run. George often referred to Glen as \\"The Old Man\\". Glen's signature song was We Shall See Jesus. Glen sat as a member of the Board of Directors of the National Quartet Convention and the Southern Gospel Museum and Hall of Fame for many years, being enshrined in the SGMA Hall of Fame at Dollywood in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee itself in 1998. Death Glen died due to complications from cancer in October, 1999 during the Cathedral's farewell tour. Although unable to attend that year, Glen made his final performance at the National Quartet Convention via telephone hook-up from his hospital bed at Vanderbilt Hospital. During this Cathedral's appearance at NQC, Glen talked with George and the audience over the phone and, at George's behest, sang the old hymn I Won't Have To Cross Jordan Alone in one of the most memorable NQC performances of all time. It was the final time Glen would perform publicly with the Cathedrals. Payne was married and had three children and three grandchildren. References Glenn Payne died on October 15, 1999.

The strip club used was \\"Bambi's\\" on the Alcoa Highway which is now called Ball Gentlemen's Club in Knoxville, TN(). Many of the scenes were shot in South Knoxville near Seymour, Strawberry Plains, Greenback, and Norris Lake and have been drastically changed since shooting due to mining, suburban development, and culture. The wrestling scenes that Al and The Kid watch were filmed during an actual Smoky Mountain Wrestling event with Buddy Landell as the good guy and Headbanger Thrasher as \\"Saddam Insane\\" in 1995.

Davis College Homecoming Features Keynote Speaker Dr. Ron Hawkins and Gospel Singer Dr. Bill Dykes , WIVT (newschannel34), Retrieved November 19, 2010 The son of a Baptist preacher, Dykes became his father's music director at age 12 because there was no one else to serve and he was willing to do it. Since then he has had the privilege of being mentored musically by several of the greatest musicians in gospel music, and has sung throughout all of North America and in other countries, in literally thousands of churches. History Dykes started singing with The Chancellor Quartet from Hamilton, Ohio, when he was just 19 years old. Big Dave Stewart sang bass, Floyd Arthur Jr. (quartet founder) sang lead, Frank Ferrell sang tenor, and Dykes sang baritone. Dykes then joined The Rhythm Masters from Cincinnati, featuring Buddy Lyles (of The Florida Boys), Dan Hubbard, Grady \\"Chico\\" Nix (The Prophits), and Bill Phelps (The Hemphills). They remain great friends today. In October 2006, The Rhythm Masters joined together for a reunion concert in northern Kentucky. In 1970, Dykes joined Coy Cook & The Senators from Pensacola, Florida. At that time, the Senators were owned by renowned gospel music promoter J.G. Whitfield, who also owned The Singing News. The Senators consisted of Coy Cook, Mac Evans, Calvin Runyon, and Nick Bruno. Not long after Dykes joined The Senators, Nick Bruno left and was replaced by Ralph Jarmin. Mac Evans left and was replaced by Don Burris. The Senators headlined and opened for all of J.G. Whitfield's concerts. Every major act typically performed at Bonnifay, Florida, where literally thousands of people set up tents and sat outside in lawn chairs waiting for their favorite groups to come up on the flatbed truck stage. After leaving the Senators in 1972, Dykes joined the famous Cathedral Quartet of Stowe, Ohio. Members of the group at that time were George Younce, Glenn Payne, Roy Tremble and Jim Garstand (pianist). The Cathedrals were not as well known as they became in the '80s and beyond; in the early '70s they were just launching their ministry after being on the Rex Humbard Cathedral of Tomorrow program. Dykes had the privilege to perform on an album that reached #1 in the gospel charts, The Last Sunday. In total, he performed on 4 LP albums with the Cathedral Quartet, including The Last Sunday, Town & Country, and Somebody Loves Me. He recounts, \\"Singing with the Cathedral Quartet with their sound and professionalism was probably one of the greatest experiences in my music profession and something that I'll always be grateful for.\\" In 1974, while sharing the stage with Jerry & The Singing Goffs in New Brunswick, Dykes was offered a position with the band. He accepted, and moved from Stowe, Ohio to Nashville, Tennessee to start his entertainment career. The members of the Goffs were Jerry Goff, Dave Thomas (tenor), Gary Valentine, Gene Jones, Wally Goff, & Andrea \\"LeFeaver\\" Goff. Before too long they went through a major change and hired Buck Buckles to sing tenor, while Jerry continued singing lead and Bill sang baritone; Gene Jones was on the piano; Barry Hess played bass guitar, and Wally Goff played the Hammond B3 organ. Of The Singing Goffs, Dykes said, \\"This was without a doubt one of the greatest group of gospel entertainers & musicians that I ever had the privilege of working with. Most people wouldn't know that Jerry Goff was one of the finest preachers that I ever sat under. When I was with The Goffs, we did many three-day crusades and saw many, many folks come to the saving knowledge of Christ.\\" Dykes recently had the privilege of participating in an interview with Dr. Jerry Goff and Gayle Tackett at the 2008 National Quartet Convention in Louisville, KY. It will be part of a soon to be released documentary of Dr. Jerry Goff. When Dykes left The Goffs, it was to take the position of Vice President and Director of A&R; for QCA Records in Cincinnati, Ohio. He then got back together with The Rhythm Masters, then owned by Carroll & Linda Rawlings. He said of the experience, \\"We had a young 18 year old talent by the name of Rene Taube - this was her first experience of singing with a group and gospel music of any sort. We had a #1 song, \\"God Rides on Wings of Love,\\" during that time, and another chart song, \\"It's About Time\\".\\" In 1985, Dykes started a group called Chariot in Cincinnati, Ohio. He said, \\"The original members of Chariot were Larry Orrell, Gayle Tacket, and Charles Novell and I. Over the past 22 years, we've changed members many times because we were a part-time group that usually sang corporate shows and private parties.\\" Personal life Although Dykes has been a businessman and professional for the past 25 years, he still sings in churches around the United States.

He got his start singing when he was a boy. His dad preached revivals at area churches, and the family sang beforehand. Gospel music was a big part of the Fowlers' home life. When Fowler was 14, friends took him to see the famous Cathedral Quartet. He fell in love with their music and recalls \\"buying $100 worth of music at their concert... and that was my hard earned grass cutting money!\\" He was a gospel music fan from that moment on.http://www.legacyfive.com/2012/bio_scott.html Quartet singing In the spring of 1987, after spending two years at Oakland City University and two subsequent years in nursing school in St. Louis, Fowler finally got the chance to live out his quartet dream. He moved to Houston, Texas, where he spent 2¬Ω years singing with a group called The Sound. The Cathedrals In December 1990, Fowler was asked to join the Cathedral Quartet, and served as the group's baritone for ten years until they retired in December 1999. During those years, he sang beside southern gospel greats George Younce (bass singer) and Glen Payne (lead singer). Legacy Five When the Cathedral Quartet retired from singing in December 1999, Scott Fowler and Cathedral piano player, Roger Bennett decided to continue the rich musical tradition of Southern gospel quartet singing by forming their own group. Legacy Five was organized and had their official debut in January 2000 in Atlanta, Georgia. The original group members included Fowler on lead, Bennett at the piano, Scott Howard as baritone, Josh Cobb as tenor, and bass singer Glenn Dustin. Their first CD was Strong in the Strength. Over the years, Legacy Five has had several personnel changes, including the death of piano player and Fowler's best friend, Roger Bennett.

Career Siembieda is a third- generation Polish American.\\"Likewise, though I am of Polish descent, I am third generation American and can speak virtually none of the Polish language and know little about \\"traditional\\" Polish customs.\\" Kevin Siembieda, Rifts Conversion Book, 1991. He attended the College for Creative Studies in Detroit from 1974 to 1977. He wanted to be a comic book artist, but found the industry difficult to break into and published a small-press comic (A+ Plus, 1977-1978) with his company: Megaton Publications. In 1979 Siembieda discovered the Dungeons & Dragons Basic Rulebook and joined a role-playing group, the Wayne Street Weregamers, which met at Wayne State University in Detroit (where he befriended Erick Wujcik, who ran the group). Siembieda ran a game for the group, the Palladium of Desires, a combination of AD&D; and his house rules. By 1980 the Wayne Weregamers became the Detroit Gaming Centre, with Siembieda its assistant director and Wujcik its director. Siembieda tried to interest gaming companies in his RPG with little interest; only Judges Guild made him an offer, but he accepted a job offer from them instead. He was an artist for Judges Guild for four months before working as a freelance artist for other publishers and trying to sell his RPG to them. Siembieda is the co-founder and president of Palladium Books. He founded the company in April 1981 to publish his fantasy role-playing game, but had insufficient funds to publish any books; the mother of Bill Loebs loaned Siembieda $1,500 to publish his first RPG book, The Mechanoid Invasion (1981). By 1983 the company was successful enough for Siembieda to rent warehouse space and release his fantasy RPG, the Palladium Fantasy Role-Playing Game with a loan of $10,000 from his friend Thom Bartold who had also loaned him funds to print the other two books in the Mechanoid Trilogy, Journey and Homeworld in 1982. These were not just loans, but investments, and Siembieda established a system of paying royalties not just to the writers and artists, but also to those who lent him the capital needed to print the books: his investors. The following year, he extended his Palladium system to the superhero genre with Heroes Unlimited. A freelancer contacted Siembieda about producing a licensed role-playing game based on the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles comic book. Siembieda obtained the rights, but was dissatisfied with the freelancer's product. Erick Wujcik redesigned the game in five weeks, and it was published in 1985 as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles & Other Strangeness. Siembieda next obtained the license to publish a game based on the Robotech anime series, designing the Robotech role-playing game published in 1986. Siembieda wrote the RPG Rifts (1990) as a trade paperback in a two-column format which he laid out by hand. He supported Wujcik in founding his own company, Phage Press. In 1992, Siembieda sued Wizards of the Coast over its first RPG book, The Primal Order; GAMA president Mike Pondsmith helped the parties reach a compromise in March 1993. Siembieda also disagreed with White Wolf magazine and GDW over their magazines' coverage of Palladium games. He demanded that websites devoted to Rifts and Palladium be taken down, claiming that they violated his intellectual property, but softened his stance in 2004. Siembieda fired Bill Coffin due to editorial differences and discontent with the Rifts Coalition Wars, which Siembieda and Coffin co-authored. On April 19, 2006 he announced that Palladium Books was on the verge of bankruptcy, which he blamed on a former employee who was convicted of embezzlement. Siembieda filed a lawsuit on May 7, 2010 against Trion Worlds for its MMORPG Rift: Planes of Telara, and a settlement was reached in October 2010. Role-playing games Siembieda has created include Palladium Fantasy Role-Playing Game (1983), Heroes Unlimited (1984), Robotech (1986), and Rifts (1990). He is also an artist, known for occasionally illustrating Palladium Books products. Siembieda contributed art and cartography to several early Judges Guild products for the Dungeons & Dragons, RuneQuest and Traveller lines. Siembieda's Robotech RPG Tactics Kickstarter is one of the largest failures in table-top Kickstarter history. The project failed to deliver on its goals and raised over $1.4M. Despite not making its goal and unable to deliver Wave 2, Palladium did not refund money given to the project.

Commissioned in early 1943, Shepparton was primarily employed as a survey vessel, tasked with updating Age of Sail-era charts and data for regions of New Guinea. The corvette was placed in reserve in 1946, and sold for scrap in 1958. Design and construction In 1938, the Australian Commonwealth Naval Board (ACNB) identified the need for a general purpose 'local defence vessel' capable of both anti-submarine and mine-warfare duties, while easy to construct and operate.Stevens, The Australian Corvettes, p. 1Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, p. 103 The vessel was initially envisaged as having a displacement of approximately 500 tons, a speed of at least , and a range of Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, pp. 103‚Äì4 The opportunity to build a prototype in the place of a cancelled Bar-class boom defence vessel saw the proposed design increased to a 680-ton vessel, with a top speed, and a range of , armed with a 4-inch gun, equipped with asdic, and able to fitted with either depth charges or minesweeping equipment depending on the planned operations: although closer in size to a sloop than a local defence vessel, the resulting increased capabilities were accepted due to advantages over British-designed mine warfare and anti-submarine vessels.Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, pp. 103‚Äì5 Construction of the prototype did not go ahead, but the plans were retained.Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, p. 104 The need for locally built 'all-rounder' vessels at the start of World War II saw the \\"Australian Minesweepers\\" (designated as such to hide their anti-submarine capability, but popularly referred to as \\"corvettes\\") approved in September 1939, with 60 constructed during the course of the war: 36 (including Shepparton) ordered by the RAN, 20 ordered by the British Admiralty but manned and commissioned as RAN vessels, and 4 for the Royal Indian Navy.Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, pp. 105, 148Donohue, From Empire Defence to the Long Haul, p. 29Stevens et al., The Royal Australian Navy, p. 108 Shepparton was laid down on 14 November 1941 by HMA Naval Dockyard at Williamstown, Victoria, launched on 15 August 1942 by Lady Goudle, wife of the Victorian Commissioner of Public Works, and commissioned into the RAN on 1 February 1943. Operational history Shepparton entered operational service in April 1943, and was primarily employed as an armed survey ship. Shepparton served in New Guinea and New Britain between April 1943 and October 1944, and in the waters of northern Australian until 1 February 1945, at which point she went to Brisbane for refitting. The refit concluded on 2 April 1945, with Shepparton assigned to various areas in northern Australia and the islands of New Guinea, before returning to Brisbane on 21 October 1945. The corvette received two battle honours for her wartime service: \\"Pacific 1943\\" and \\"New Guinea 1943‚Äì44\\". During the war, Shepparton sailed just over during 5,072 hours spend underway. The last surveys of many regions of New Guinea and the Solomon Islands had been performed during the Age of Sail, and were woefully inaccurate by modern standards. The accomplishments of Shepparton and other survey ships during the Pacific campaigns generated a wealth of survey and hydrographic data, with one author claiming shortly after the war's end that these areas \\"are better mapped than the greater part of the Australian mainland, or for that matter, better than many parts of the world which were outside the operative zones of the war.\\" Fate Shepparton paid off to reserve on 10 May 1946. She was towed to Sydney by sister ship in early November 1947, where she remained until her sale for scrap on 20 February 1958. Shepparton was sold to the Mitsubishi Shoji Kaisha company, and was towed to Japan by the Shitako Maru.

In 1992, the Fipa population was estimated to number 200,000, reduced to 195,000 in the 2002 census. History =Dynastic history= Historically, the Fipa lived on the largely treeless Ufipa Plateau looking down on Lake Tanganyika, appearing as a bridge joining east to central Africa and the Congo. They were a mixed population ‚Äì Fipa, Wanda, and Nyika ‚Äì with roughly 20,000 people in the 1890s. Many had come from the Congo, with chiefdoms dominating a number of clans. Since iron was a precious commodity, and iron smelting required technical knowledge, it was jealously guarded, resulting in a number of clans being subject to ironsmiths. The central chiefdom, Milanzi (\\"the eternal village\\"), was headed by a dynasty of ironsmiths, which exchanged its products for woven cloth. These clans and dynasties were later taken over by an even newer immigrant group, the Twa, possibly the Tutsi from the north, who were organized as a single clan and dominated others by force and cunning. While the Twa established themselves as an aristocracy, the older Milansi dynasty retained ritual power and the right to install the Twa chief. It was, however, the Twa (after splitting into two chiefdoms) who exercised territorial and administrative authority through their appointed officials, with orders then transmitted to elected village headmen. The Fipa had now finally become more stratified, had even more precise borders, and were governed in a more strictly supervised manner. It had become a real state. Nkansi Nkansi (Nkasi), on the Ufipa Plateau, was a chiefdom with a particularly extreme and elaborate form of political organization, even having a prime minister, and according to some, had a life comparable to peasantry in the richest of European countries. It became traditional to have hereditary chiefs who were surrounded by a court of at least nine titled officials and others to administer specific areas of the chiefdom. The Queen Mother was also important, having her own separate palace and court, a large estate that paid her tribute. On the lowest administrative level was an elected village headman with a female magistrate whose special function was to decide breaches of the public order by either sex, particularly in regards to the use of obscene language and brawling. The judiciary could also be elaborate. Cases were first heard by a headman; from there a defendant could appeal to the district sub- chief, then to the royal court, and finally to the chief, queen mother, and council of elders. If a person were found guilty of murder, the murderer was ordered to give a man (or woman, if a woman had been killed) to the family of the murdered person. If there was no one to give, the murderer was told to choose between death and becoming a slave to the murdered person's family. If the murderer became a slave, his family could ransom him. Their readiness to do so was expressed by the gift of a hoe, and an agreement was reached in front of the royal court. Only the chief could impose the death penalty, which was carried out immediately by poison, spearing, or decapitation. =19th century history= Until the 1860s, the Wafipa were described as still peaceful and prosperous, although somewhat plagued by raiders. By the 1870s, however, warriors were now carrying Wahehe-style hide shields and spears. The villages had become palisaded, and slowly chaos, terror, and warfare began to dominate the area, primarily as a result of the private army of Kimaurunga (Kimalaunga). The rulers of Ufipa, from 1860‚Äì1890, made alliances with coastal traders, and the state experienced stability and outward prosperity. On entering Ufipa, a visitor paid a small tribute and then became the chief's guest. Each village provided the visitor with accommodations and carried his load to the next settlement. The Fipa were not aggressive, were said never to wage war, but generally obtained enough firearms to deter most potential aggressors by exchanging their grain for slaves, with which they then bought guns from the coastal traders. The German explorer Paul Reichard, who visited the Ufipa around 1882, said that \\"calm, peace and order\\" reigned within the Fipa state. He described the rule of King Kapuufi as \\"generally energetic, but nevertheless mild\\". Below the surface, however, there were a number of destructive consequences. The local weaving industry declined, while the Twa chiefs were able to enforce much heavier contributions in goods, livestock, and labor from their subjects. In place of cotton, beads, and wire being exchanged, there were guns and powder going into the interior to trade for human beings. In 1889‚Äì1890, British explorer H. H. Johnston wrote of the Ufipa area: \\"I...have seen all human life and culture stamped out for a distance of 50 miles along the road, where only a short time before the most flourishing villages existed.\\" =Contact with Europeans= Prophet Kaswa is said to have prophesied the coming of Europeans: \\"There are coming terrible strangers who bring war; they will surely come. O you people, you are going to be robbed of your country: you will not even be able to cough.\\" It was not until 1905‚Äì1919 that the Wafipa began seeking employment with Europeans. Traditional society =Settlements= The Wafipa tended to live in concentrated, widely spaced settlements of 20‚Äì30 round huts, no more than a few yards apart, each housing three to five each, with two surrounding corridor walls for small livestock. An inner room was for eating and sleeping. Reed mats for sleeping and filtering beer were made by the women, who also used a small hoe when working the fields. Men also made the beds: a single cow hide, or cow hide strips, stretched over a wooden frame with a reed mat placed on the bed before sleeping in it. A total of 100 people in a village were normal; 300‚Äì400 people were large and not common. Everyone wore durable cotton cloth of black and white stripes of six by five feet. It took four to five hours to cover the eight-to-nine miles between settlements. Within the settlements, there was a strong emphasis placed on communal values, the most important being sociability. Almost all of East Africa's people viewed forests and fields to be at least somewhat antagonistic. There was hostility between cultivated land and the wildness of the bush. The Fipa in particular saw the bush as full of dangers and stressed the village as properly dominant over the surrounding bush. With the Wafipa, each spirit cult was associated with rocks, mountain, groves, and lakes, and had a shrine where a priest tended a sacred python whose domestication represented man's control over nature. =Land= The Ufipa Plateau was deforested and the soil exhausted. The Fipa planted their principal crops on earth-covered compost piles of vegetation roughly a mile or more from a settlement. Thompson wrote: \\"They are more of a purely agricultural race than any other tribe I have seen. To the cultivation of their fields they devote themselves entirely.\\" During the busy time of harvest, those working the land built round huts in which to sleep and find shelter. The main crop was millet, to be made into dry porridge and usually eaten with the fingers accompanied by beans. Traditionally, all land belonged to the chief. Any Fipa could plant wherever they wished, as long as payment was made to the local official. While there was no shortage of land itself, there was a shortage of fertile land, and distances between settlements tended to increase. Fishing was supposed to be important in the area of Lake Rukwa (although the Germans make no mention of fish products found in Kimaurunga's Boma), Lake Tanganyika, and the surrounding rivers. =Gender roles= The most important tasks for the men were hunting wild animals, building huts and granaries, collecting firewood, making and spreading compost piles, cutting grass, and threshing millet. The threshing was often done by cooperative groups of kinsmen and neighbors. The women's most important tasks were drawing water, weeding, cooking, plastering huts and granaries, winnowing, pounding grain, sweeping huts, using the coil method to make pottery, and raising children. =Industry= Ironsmiths were hereditary specialists. The knowledge was integrated with magic and a special bag of magical ingredients was passed from father to son. The Twa chiefs of the Wafipa, any of his family, and all women were forbidden to visit the site of a kiln or forge, while all other visitors had to acknowledge the smith's authority with a payment. The smith and his assistants were supposed to abstain from sexual intercourse, for the smelting and forging of ironwork was a very specialized craft totally bound up with knowledge and magic, using very particular ingredients from doctors and sorcerers. Spinning and weaving locally grown cotton was universal and always the work of men. The cloth was open, heavy, strong, and durable, was white with a black-stripped border and five by six feet long, sufficient for the toga-like dress worn by men and women (somewhat as the Wahehe are said to look). =Birth, life, and death= Aside from extracting two or four lower incisors before or after puberty, the Wafipa had no initiation ceremony for either sex. It was general practice among unmarried girls to extend their labia minora by constant manipulation. This was thought to enhance their sexual attractiveness and favor giving birth. If a birth was difficult, the midwives asked the name of the unborn child's father, for it was thought that unconfessed adultery could cause death in childbirth. At the birth of a girl, the father brought firewood on his head; when a boy was born, a bow and arrow was carried in the father's right hand. Following death, a meeting of kin decided the issue of inheritance and a widow was assigned to the heir, if she was willing. If a woman died in childbirth, the unborn child was cut from the belly and placed on its dead mother's back inside the grave, while the women would weep and chant inside the hut with the corpse; the men would sit quietly outside. Following the burial, the hut in which the woman died was totally destroyed. The dead were not \\"thrown away\\", Sangu-style. =Worship= Fipa diviners blamed illness on sorcery, territorial or ancestral spirits, or a neighbor or relative. Commoners tended to blame sorcery alone. Illness made it necessary to discover its cause: an ancestral spirit, a divinity, a demon, a sorcerer, or even a witch (Fipa witches were supposed to be carried upside down at night by their wives, work evil, and be all that was opposite of being good), for only with the discovery of the cause could appropriate measures be taken, such as sacrifices, ritual burning, or certain medicines, etc. The Wafipa, as with most Africans, had a supreme god: Umweele, the creator of ultimate power in the world. There was, however, no cult to this god, although it was common for those needing help to utter \\"Umweele, forgive me\\". Worship was also directed to lesser and closer divinities, the most important and terrible being Katai, said to be the enemy of domestic animals and the bringer of smallpox and other diseases. Katai could come as a dog with shining eyes, in dreams; a mouse in a hut corner; a beautiful youth; or even smoke (the African concept of deities included the souls of animals, spirits, and humans being interchangeable). When an epidemic occurred, dances were forbidden, children ceased playing noisy games, and water-pots were covered. Katai could, when s/he was in a kindly mood, also cure illness and heal suffering. When Katai was in an evil-minded mood, s/he could be appealed to for revenge or spite. There was no agreement on the sex of Katai: in the north it was male, in the south, female. There were other, more localized spirits. Hills, lakes (such as Lake Tanganyika), large trees, oddly shaped rocks, groves of trees, could all be the home of a spirit. Truly large tame pythons, representing the spirits of these places, would coil themselves on specially made stools and receive offerings of millet porridge and meat from worshipers. Worship was often conducted by a hereditary priest, often seemingly possessed of a particular spirit. Lastly, there was the worship of ancestral spirits. These were thought to inhabit the threshold of their descendants' huts. Periodically, the owner of a hut would honor them by sprinkling the walls and floors with water and flour. Twins were considered divinities, having special powers over rain and crops. They could also cause epidemics. They were publicly acclaimed, being carried around the village on a tray, and sacrifices were communally held in their honor at the new moon. They were not killed or allowed to die through starvation as with so many other groups. They were in fact so important as to be especially honored by having sacrifices offered at an altar erected by their parents outside their hut during harvest time or epidemics.

It was directed by Anthony Asquith, who also adapted the screenplay, and was produced by Anthony Asquith, Teddy Baird, and Earl St. John. Plot The story takes place on 14 February 1895. It is about two gentlemen pretending to be people other than themselves. Interwoven in their storylines are two romance-stricken ladies, each possessing an unusual allegiance to the manliness of the name Ernest. London man-about-town Jack Worthing, who hides behind the name Ernest, is an aristocrat from the country with uncertain lineage. His friend, Algernon Moncrieff, is of moderate means and has also created an imaginary character, Bunbury. Algernon's cousin, Gwendolen Fairfax, has caught the eye of Jack. Jack's ward in the country, Cecily Cardew, has caught the eye of Algernon. Lady Bracknell rules the roost with her heavy-handed social mores. The story begins in London. Jack and Algy are discussing life and love. Both reveal to each other their imaginary characters, Ernest and Bunbury. Jack reveals that he is in love with Algy's cousin, Gwendolen, and Algy reveals that he is in love with Jack's ward, Cecily. Both gentlemen begin to scheme the pursuit of their love. At tea that afternoon, Jack and Gwendolen secretly reveal their love for one another. Gwendolen makes it known that her ‚Äúideal has always been to love someone by the name of Ernest.‚Äù Jack fears she will find out his true identity. Lady Bracknell, in undulating purple silk Victorian attire, inquires as to Jack's pedigree. ‚ÄúRise, sir, from that semi-recumbent posture. It is most indecorous.‚Äù Jack confesses that he does not know who his parents are because, as a baby, he was found in a handbag in a cloakroom at Victoria Station. ‚ÄúA handbag?‚Äù Lady Bracknell will not allow her daughter ‚Äú‚Äîa girl brought up with the utmost care‚Äîto marry into a cloak-room, and form an alliance with a parcel.‚Äù At the manor house in the country, Cecily is daydreaming as her governess, Miss Prism, tries to teach her German. Uninvited, Algy arrives from London and assumes the role of Ernest. While Algy and Cecily are getting acquainted with the parlor, Jack arrives in black mourning clothes and informs Miss Prism that his brother, Ernest, is dead. When Algy and Cecily come out to see him, the sad news loses its believability as everyone now thinks Algy is Ernest. In pursuit of Jack, Gwendolen arrives from London and meets Cecily. They both discover that they are engaged to Ernest, not realizing one is Jack and one is Algy. When the men arrive in the garden, the confusion is cleared up. The ladies are put off that neither one is engaged to someone named Ernest. Lady Bracknell arrives, by train. As everyone gathers in the parlor, Lady Bracknell recognizes Miss Prism as her late sister's baby's governess from twenty-eight years before. ‚ÄúPrism! Where is that baby?‚Äù she bellows. Miss Prism confesses that she inadvertently left the baby in her handbag at Victoria Station. Jack realized they are talking about him. He retrieves the handbag from his private room and shows Miss Prism. She acknowledges that the bag is hers. Lady Bracknell then tells Jack that he is her late sister's son and the older brother to Algy. Unable to ascertain who his father was, Jack looks in an Army journal, as his father was a general, and realizes that his father's name was Ernest. Thus it becomes apparent that his real name is also Ernest - as Lady Bracknell says, being the eldest son, he must have been named after his father. The film ends with Jack saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve now realized for the first time in my life the vital importance of being earnest.‚Äù Cast *Michael Redgrave as John (Jack) Worthing *Michael Denison as Algernon Moncrieff *Edith Evans as Lady Bracknell *Joan Greenwood as Gwendolen Fairfax *Margaret Rutherford as Miss Prism *Miles Malleson as Canon Chasuble *Dorothy Tutin as Cecily Cardew *Aubrey Mather as Merriman *Walter Hudd as Lane *Richard Wattis as Seton Adaptation The film is largely faithful to Wilde's text, although it divides some of the acts into shorter scenes in different locations. Edith Evans's outraged delivery of the line \\"A handbag?\\" has become legendary. As actor Ian McKellen has written, it is a performance \\"so acclaimed and strongly remembered that it inhibits audiences and actors years later\\", providing a challenge for anyone else taking on the role of Lady Bracknell. The film is noted for its acting, although the parts played by Redgrave and Denison called for actors ten years younger. Margaret Rutherford, who plays Miss Prism in this adaptation, played Lady Bracknell in the 1946 BBC production. Awards and nominations The film received a BAFTA nomination for Dorothy Tutin as Most Promising Newcomer and a Golden Lion nomination for Anthony Asquith at the Venice Film Festival.

Firefly is a ninja master, a saboteur, and an expert in all NATO and Warsaw Pact explosives and detonators. He always places his charges in the proper location for maximum damage. His fees are paid into a numbered Swiss bank account and are always paid in advance. He makes no guarantees, and gives no refunds. =H.I.S.S.= Firefly also tends to go together with Black Out and Munitia as H.I.S.S.

Firefly's fabricated identity was Snake-Eater, real name Jason B. Lee, most likely an alias, as his birthplace and serial number were classified. Snake- Eater's specialties were ranger, counter-intelligence and cartography. He attended basic training, advanced infantry training, Airborne School and Ranger School all at Fort Benning, and also completed the Special Forces Qualification course at Fort Bragg. General Rey noted him to be brutal, impulsive and unpleasant to be around, but could not deny his great skill in the field. Toys Firefly was first released as an action figure in 1984.

When his father died, Firefly was taken in by the ninja. Training with them he eventually earned Master status, and took the name \\"Faceless Master\\". Soon after Cobra Commander approached Firefly with a job: kill the man known as Snake-Eyes. Cobra Commander blamed Snake Eyes for his brother's death. Traveling to the Arashikage dojo where Snake Eyes was training, Firefly realized that he was no match for Snake Eyes.G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero #126 (July 1992) Firefly approached the assassin Zartan for help. In a case of mistaken identity, Zartan kills the Hard Master, leader of the Arashikage, instead. The Hard Master's nephew, Storm Shadow, was blamed and he fled the dojo, dishonored and branded a traitor. On another mission for Cobra Commander, Firefly was left in the Florida Everglades by the Commander. Running into Destro, who had also been left behind, the two returned to Cobra's base in Springfield, stopping for multiple battles with the Joes. They then plan revenge.G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero #25-29 (1984) First they attempted to return to the Commander's good graces by attacking Snake Eyes' mountain lodge. The Cobra agents were surprised that Snake Eyes wasn't alone and fled.

Storm Shadow freed Billy before a verdict could be reached. Firefly in his second costume from G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero. The Soft Master arrived in Springfield, tracking down his brother's killer. Firefly and Scrap-Iron chased down the Soft Master launching two missiles at him. They killed not only the Soft Master but also Candy, G.I. Joe agent Ripcord's girlfriend. Billy lost an eye and a leg. Ripcord was captured soon afterwards, but not before he transmitted the location of Springfield back to G.I. Joe HQ. Firefly was one of the last Cobra agents to leave Springfield. Firefly took more jobs from Cobra, fighting the October Guard in Afghanistan and fighting the G.I. Joe Team in the Baltic Sea and atop a glacier. He also tried to steal the Vector Jet from the Joes, but was stopped by Maverick. He also fought to secure a man made island near Cobra Island, but the unstable island soon sank just before the G.I. Joe Team could force the Cobra forces off the island. Dr. Mindbender took the blame for the failure in exchange for Firefly saving him. Firefly then attempted to steal top secret computer disks from the U.S. Government. He was stopped by the original G.I. Joe, Joseph Colton. G.I.

Firefly is absent for most of the second season but appeared in the episode \\"Into Your Tent I Will Silently Creep\\" alongside Cobra Commander, Storm Shadow, and Destro. In at least one episode, he is shown to be almost paranoid about concealing his identity, going so far as to threaten captives' lives if they turn to look at him despite the fact that he is wearing a mask; and becoming mildly enraged when Cobra Commander refers to him by his codename (acting as though he had just been addressed by his real name). G.I. Joe: The Movie He also appears in the G.I. Joe: The Movie, but only for a short time. After the cartoon switched production companies from Sunbow/Marvel to DIC Entertainment, Firefly made no further appearances. =Direct to DVD films= Firefly is featured in a toy line based on G.I. Joe: Valor vs. Venom as a civilian turned into one of Cobra's Venomised troops. =Sigma 6= Firefly has a major role in the Sigma 6 cartoon, joining the G.I. Joe Team at the beginning of the second season. He is shown to use fire-based weapons in battle. Throughout the first half of the season, it is hinted that there is a spy amongst the Joes. This is eventually revealed to be Firefly, who traps the team and turns them over to Cobra. Firefly's former commander Lt. Stone attempts to convince him it is not too late to side with the Joes, but Firefly is insulted by the offer. He shaves his head as a sign of his loyalty to Cobra, and after a climatic battle with Lt. Stone, leaves with Cobra Commander. In \\"Ice\\", Firefly reappears wearing a costume reminiscent to both his Sigma 6 suit and his appearance in \\"A Real American Hero.\\" In the episode, he fights Snake Eyes at a Terrordrome base in Antarctica. After Snake Eyes was accidentally frozen, Firefly captures Snake Eyes and makes off with Snake Eyes before the Antarctic Terrordrome base explodes. In \\"Assault\\", Firefly fights Stone again and is defeated. Firefly escapes the collapsing base and tells Stone that he should leave. He was voiced by Sean Schemmel in the English version. =Resolute= Firefly had a brief appearance in G.I. Joe: Resolute where he used a portable rocket launcher to fire a projectile into the United Nations building. However, the device was only a holographic transmitter that allowed Cobra Commander to relay his demands to the world leaders. =Renegades= Firefly first appears in the G.I. Joe: Renegades episode \\"Fire Fight\\" voiced by Peter MacNicol. Reimagined as a pyromaniacal arsonist who talks to fire like a lover, Firefly covers his face in Renegades not to obscure his identity, but to hide disfiguring burns all across his body that his obsession has left him scarred with. Baroness and Doctor Mindbender send Firefly to burn the town of Green Ridge when the town won a court battle to prevent Cobra Industries from constructing of a dam. First, Firefly burns down the mayor's house with the fire being thwarted by Duke, Roadblock, Barbecue, and Tunnel Rat. Firefly is then ordered to destroy the entire town with all Cobra personnel leaving town. Duke continued to pursue Firefly, who managed to escape. Firefly blows up the bridge out of town, causing G.I. Joe to try to get through the dam. Duke and Snake Eyes confronted Firefly near his helicopter and he escaped. Firefly stowed away on his helicopter (which Roadblock was using in a plot to blow up the dam) and Firefly fought Barbecue causing the helicopter to lose control. Roadblock got Barbecue out of Firefly's helicopter before it crashes into the cliff. It is unknown if Firefly survived or not.  Live action film  Ray Stevenson portrays Firefly in G.I. Joe: Retaliation, the sequel to G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra. Stevenson revealed in an interview to Total Films that Firefly is an ex-Joe. His codename in this version stems from his trademark weapon system, insectoid robot drones which he uses to surreptitiously deliver explosive charges. During production of the film the character was not supposed to wear his trademark camouflaged mask, but Stevenson, who researched the character and became a fan of the original Firefly, lobbied to be shown wearing it in some scenes.While trying to activate a destructive satellite for Cobra Commander he is attacked by Roadblock who causes Firefly's drones to explode on Firefly. Video games Firefly is one of the featured villains in the 1985 G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero computer game. Firefly appeared as a boss in 1992's G.I. Joe: The Atlantis Factor for the Nintendo Entertainment System. In the video game G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra, Firefly is the second boss who is fought towards the end of the \\"Desert Jewel\\" act.

Known as the Trail of the Lonesome Pine, the state highway runs from the Kentucky state line on top of Black Mountain, where the highway continues north as Kentucky Route 160 (KY 160), east to SR 68 in Appalachia. Due to the mountainous terrain and numerous tight bends, Virginia State Route 160 and its Kentucky State Route 160 counterpart are signposted closed to tractor-trailers between Lynch, KY and Appalachia, VA. Route description View east at the west end of SR 160 at KY 160 at the Kentucky state line on Black Mountain SR 160 begins on top of Black Mountain at the Kentucky state line, which follows the Tennessee Valley Divide. The highest elevation in Kentucky can be accessed by following Black Mountain Ridge Road, which intersects KY 160 just west of the state line, to the summit of the mountain. SR 160 has a curvaceous descent featuring several hairpin turn to the valley of Looney Creek, which the highway follows east toward Appalachia. The state highway enters the town shortly before reaching its eastern terminus at its intersection with SR 68 (Exeter Road), which itself reaches its terminus at U.S. Route 23 Business (Main Street) at the southern edge of downtown Appalachia. History SR 160 was initially numbered State Route 115 in the 1923 renumbering as a spur from State Route 11 in Appalachia. This road, known as the Lynch Highway (as it led to Lynch, Kentucky), was added to the state highway system in early 1923. , page 7 However, it was soon removed pending investigation of a conflicting contract for a turnpike company to build the road, , page 12 but almost immediately reinstated, with the turnpike's right-of-way deed transferred to the state. , page 13 In the 1928 renumbering, the road was renumbered as part of State Route 106 (which also continued south from Appalachia along SR 11 to Big Stone Gap and then to State Route 10 at Clinchport, replacing State Route 116), and it became State Route 67 in the 1933 renumbering. For a few years in the early 1930s, SR 106 carried U.S. Route 23 from Appalachia to Kentucky, but US 23 was soon realigned to its current route; the piece of SR 106 south of Big Stone Gap continued to carry US 23 and was thus eliminated in 1933.

When Mrs. Prysselius goes to speak with the local law enforcement of the need for the girl to be placed in a home for orphans, she lets certain details (her lack of adult supervision, living alone, having a large supply of gold coins kept out in the open, and most of all, leaving her door unlocked) be revealed to a pair of thieves already in jail. The thieves, Bloom and Thunder-Karlsson, decide to rob Pippi themselves once they break out of jail. Pippi and her friends take part in many adventures and close-calls, winning over almost everyone, with the exception of Mrs. Prysselius and Tommy and Annika's parents.

Plot The cartoon begins with a tour of a hospital. Porky checks in with a stomach ache, caused by overeating at his birthday party. Instead of a real doctor, he encounters a crazy cat patient posing as \\"Dr. Chilled-Air\\" (a reference to Dr. Kildare). Porky explains that he has a stomach ache brought on by overeating at his birthday party. The cat says, \\"Well, let's take a look\\" and slams an X-Ray machine into him and the X-Ray shows a birthday cake with only one piece missing and candles still lit in Porky's stomach, that cat decides to take Porky on as his own patient. The cat escorts Porky over to a bed then throws onto a bed where Porky bounces up off of it, his clothes come off and a gown that was laying on the bed flies into the sir and Porky skips right into it and bounces onto the bed and the covers go right over him. and rushes him off to the operating room where he intends on performing surgery on him. The cat is sharpening knives and polishing a huge saw with a rag. then uses an airbag as a punching bag. The cat strolls over to Porky with the saw in his hand and pulls down the covers then lifts his gown and brings the saw over to cut open Porkys belly. After Porky realizes what the cat's intentions are, he panics and exclaims \\"Hey! Wh-wh-wh-what's a big idea?!\\" and squirms around to escape from him while the cat still has his gown raised and continues to try to cut him open. Porky finally breaks free from the cat and dives under the bed and crawls through the sheets in an attempt to getaway.

In 1999, the Dhaiso population was estimated to number 5,000, and the Dhaiso language is not being transmitted by adults to children. The Dhaiso are historically related to the Segeju, and are sometimes referred to as \\"Islamized Segeju\\". The Segeju are also found in the Kwale county of Kenya. Most of their tradition has been heavily influenced by their populous Digo neighbors. The Dhaiso and the Segeju are also historically linked to the Kamba. Society Dhaiso people are mostly farms or, if on the coast, fishermen. Farmers commonly grow cocoa beans, coconut cassava, black pepper and cinnamon. Many of the larger farms have running water which are gravity fed from springs in the mountains. Houses are similar to others in the region which are commonly made with stick frames filled with small rocks and covered over with mud. Many homes have fenced courtyards or verandas for shade and protection from the rain. The Dhaiso have a Muslim society and men often trousers and shirts are common paired with Muslim hats. Some men may wear the long Kanzu. Women wear the African Kanga. Many also wear western style dresses, skirts, and blouses. Polygamy is part of the Dhaiso culture. A wife's funeral expenses are divided among the husband and his brothers and the brothers and sisters of the dead woman. Expenses are also contributed to by the husband's additional wives. All weddings and funerals are marked by the beating of the war drums. Inheritance laws apply to coconut palms, but not to land, huts, and livestock. Language Daiso (language) is also called Kidhaiso. Speakers are found in the Tanzanian villages of Bwiti and Magati at the base of the eastern Usambara mountains on the northern side, and in the Muheza district in the Tanga region. The language is related to Kamba of Kenya. Because many Dhaiso people have intermarried with people of different languages, the language is not being passed on to newer generations (most primary-school age children do not speak Dhaiso) as there is a need for wider communication. Because of this need, most Dhaiso are fluent in Swahili. Swahili is the national language and the language of trade along the coast. For a majority of Dhaiso, Swahili is their mother tongue. and many also say they can speak other neighboring languages like Digo or Sambaa. In 1999, with 5,000 speakers, Dhaiso was considered by UNESCO to be a \\"definitely endangered\\" language.

One is composed of Catholic priests and Religious Brothers, founded in 1852, and the other is composed of Religious Sisters, founded in 1843, both by Marie Theodor Ratisbonne, along with his brother Marie-Alphonse Ratisbonne, \\"to witness in the Church and in the world that God continues to be faithful in his love for the Jewish people and to hasten the fulfillment of the promises concerning the Jews and the Gentiles.\\" (Constitution, article 2). Foundation =The Brothers= The Ratisbonne brothers, who were Jews, were drawn to accept Christianity. For Theodore, this came about through the conversion of several close friends and the slow results of study and reading. He was baptized in 1826 and ordained in 1830. Alphonse, however, was more reluctant to believe in Christ. This changed dramatically on 20 January 1842 in the course of a trip to Rome, made just prior to his planned wedding. While on a visit to the Church of Sant'Andrea delle Fratte, the Blessed Virgin Mary appeared to him. Both brothers believed that this was a sign from God, not only for Alphonse's personal conversion, but of their common call to bring their fellow Jews to accept the Christian faith. To this end, Alphonse was baptized and soon entered the Society of Jesus, where he spent several years. In 1843 Theodore founded a small community of women who wished to collaborate with him in the education of Jewish children, starting with two Jewish sisters who had come to him for guidance and later converted to Christianity. In 1850, with the permission of the pope and of the Jesuit Superior General, Alphonse left the Society to join his brother and his work. Together the Ratisbonne brothers established the Congregation of the Fathers of Our Lady of Sion in 1852. In 1855 Alphonse moved to the Holy Land, where, in 1858, he established the Convent of the Ecce homo on the site of a ruined church of that name on the famed Via Dolorosa for the Sisters of the congregation. On the grounds of the convent, Ratisbonne built an orphanage and vocational school which the Sisters ran. These institutions were open to all the children of the city, regardless of creed. A motherhouse was established in Paris for the Fathers.Catholic encyclopedia In 1874, Alphonse began the construction of the Ratisbonne Monastery, on a site then on the outskirts of Jerusalem, which was a school for boys. It now houses a branch of the Salesian Pontifical University. After the re-direction of the official teachings regarding Judaism, the Fathers changed from an emphasis on the conversion of Jews to working to foster understanding and the development of deeper ties between Christians and Jews. Today they have communities in France, Israel and Brazil.The Religious of Our Lady of Sion =The Sisters= For many years most of the Sisters were teachers in Sion schools in France and the Holy Land. They later expanded overseas to the British Isles and Australia. The sisters of Sion define themselves as ‚Äúwoman who help to heal a fractured world‚Äù. The Sisters were invited to England by Cardinal Manning to help with the expansion of Catholic education in the country. They arrived in 1860 and have had a presence in England ever since. They then established a presence in Australia with the first Sisters arriving in 1890. Since the Second Vatican Council the work of the Sisters has expanded and developed. Now there is a wide variety of ministries. The congregation now has Sisters in 22 countries worldwide, with their General Motherhouse located in Rome. Like the Fathers, the Sisters no longer emphasise conversion, but instead describe themselves as working to improve Catholic-Jewish relations and to witness to God's faithful love for the Jewish people. One of its best-known members of the Congregation was S≈ìur Emmanuelle, N.D.S., (1908-2008) who worked in Istanbul and Cairo.

The album was recorded in Weed, California with Sylvia Massy-Shivy at the helm. She had previously worked with the metal act Tool. Several titles were proposed for the album, and until very close to its completion, it was to be dubbed \\"Murder at the Late Show\\", an odious reference to the converted theater in which it was recorded.

In addition to the tracks present on the album, three other songs; \\"Eyes All Lies\\", \\"Drip\\", and \\"It's Cold Inside\\" (the latter two being reworked and rerecorded versions of Motel Murder Madness and 2001 demo songs) were recorded. A fourth unreleased track titled Gemini Twin was also recorded, but no one except for the band members has ever heard it. None of the aforementioned tracks were officially released, although the three former songs were widely distributed among 'The Lollipop Guild', the band's semi-official and loyal fanbase.

He was the maternal grandfather of current Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Life and career Sinclair was born in Crossroads, Grange, Banffshire, Scotland,http://www.thepeerage.com/p59166.htm#i591652 the son of James George Sinclair (March 9, 1879; Wick, Scotland - March 18, 1962; Vancouver) and Betsy Sinclair n√©e Ross (December 12, 1878; Evanton, Scotland - September 18, 1959; Vancouver). He moved to Vancouver with his family in 1911 where his father, who had already immigrated a year earlier, was among the founders of Vancouver Technical Secondary School, the area's first vocational school, and served as the school's second principal from 1930 until 1944. Sinclair studied engineering at the University of British Columbia and was awarded a Rhodes scholarship in 1928 to study mathematics at St John's College, in the University of Oxford. He also studied mathematical physics at Princeton University. During World War II, he served with the Royal Canadian Air Force in North Africa, Malta, and Sicily. He was first elected to the House of Commons of Canada representing the riding of Vancouver North in the 1940 federal election. A Liberal, he was re-elected in 1945 in the riding of Vancouver North, and in 1949, 1953, and 1957 in the riding of Coast-Capilano. He was defeated in the 1958 federal election. From 1949 to 1952, he was the Parliamentary Assistant to the Minister of Finance. From 1952 to 1957, he was the Minister of Fisheries. From 1958 to 1960, he was the President of Fisheries Association of British Columbia. From 1960 to 1970, he was President and Chairman of Lafarge Cement of North America. He was also a director of the Bank of Montreal and of Canadian Industries limited. He took part in the economic mission headed by Charles Drury with people such as Paul Desmarais, Yves Dub√©, Marcel Faribeault to France in June 1966. From 1970 to 1973 he was Deputy Chairman of Canada Cement Lafarge Limited. In 1978, according to testimony in the trial of four murdered teenagers, their killings were part of a failed attempted scheme to kidnap four prominent Vancouver-area families including James Sinclair's. He died in 1984 of a myocardial infarction at his home in West Vancouver. Married in Saint Stephen's Anglican Church, West Vancouver on November 2, 1940 to Doris Kathleen Bernard (February 11, 1920; Penticton, British Columbia - March 29, 2012; Saanich, British Columbia), he was the father of five daughters. His fourth daughter is Margaret Joan Trudeau n√©e Sinclair, one-time wife of the 15th Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau and mother of 23rd and current Canadian Prime Minister Justin Pierre James Trudeau (his second middle name is for Sinclair), Alexandre Trudeau and Michel Trudeau. Many, including 20th Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chr√©tien and Justin Trudeau himself, have noted the family resemblance in physical appearance and political skill between Sinclair and Justin Trudeau. Sinclair is also the namesake of Xavier James Trudeau (b. October 18, 2007; Montreal), son of Justin Trudeau and Sophie Gr√©goire Trudeau. The Sinclair Centre, a shopping complex in downtown Vancouver, is named after him.

University of Virginia, 1998, p.7 It is thought that beginning in the second millennium B.C., particular Nilotic speaking communities began to move southward into present- day South Sudan where most settled and that the societies today referred to as the Southern Nilotes pushed further on, reaching what is present-day north- eastern Uganda by 1000 B.C. Linguist Christopher Ehret proposes that between 1000 and 700 BC, the Southern Nilotic speaking communities, who kept domestic stock and possibly cultivated sorghum and finger millet,Clark, J., & Brandt, St, From Hunters to Farmers: The Causes and Consequences of Food Production in Africa. University of California Press, 1984, p.234 lived next to an Eastern Cushitic speaking community with whom they had significant cultural interaction. The general location of this point of cultural exchange being somewhere near the common border between Sudan, Uganda, Kenya, and Ethiopia. He suggests that the cultural exchange perceived in borrowed loan words, adoption of the practice of circumcision and the cyclical system of age-set organisation dates to this period.Ehret, Christopher.

University of Virginia, 1998, pp.161‚Äì164 Linguist Christopher Ehret suggests that around the fifth and sixth centuries BC, the speakers of the Southern Nilotic languages split into two major divisions - the proto-Kalenjin and the proto-Datooga. The former took shape among those residing to the north of the Mau range while the latter took shape among sections that moved into the Mara and Loita plains south of the western highlands.Ehret, C., History and the Testimony of Language, p.118 Recent History There are at least seven Datooga tribes: * Bajuta * Gisamjanga (Kisamajeng, Gisamjang) * Barabayiiga (Barabaig, Barabayga, Barabaik, Barbaig) * Asimjeeg (Tsimajeega, Isimijeega) * Rootigaanga (Rotigenga, Rotigeenga) * Buraadiiga (Buradiga, Bureadiga) * Bianjiida (Biyanjiida, Utatu) The dialects of the Datooga language are often divergent enough to make comprehension difficult, though Barabayiiga and Gisamjanga are very close.

History The Barabaig are one of the Nilotic peoples who migrated south to East Africa from the Nile Valley in North Africa more than a thousand years ago. They form the largest group among the Tatoga- speaking people. Linguists tell us they entered what is now Kenya late in the first millennium AD where they congregated around Mount Elgon up until around 250 years ago.Ehret, C. 1974 Ethiopians and East Africans: The Problem of Contacts, East African Publishing House, Nairobi In the late 1800s, German explorers found them on the Serengeti plains of German East Africa now Tanzania.Jaeger, F. 1913 Das Hochland der Reisenkrater und die umliegenden hochlander Deutsch-Ostafrikas. Tiel I; Aufgaben und Verlauf ‚Äì Die Karte ‚Äì Ergenbisse der Sammlungen ‚Äì Ethnographisches. In Mitt. Dt. Schutzgebiette, Erg.H. No.8, 213, Seiten, Berlin. Archaeological evidence suggests that they were still in the Ngorongoro Highlands until around 150 years ago, before they were chased out by the Maasai, who live there to this day, still calling the area Osupuko loo Ltatua (Mountains of the Tatoga). The Tatoga then headed south along the eastern branch of East Africa's Great Rift Valley and eventually split into groups they call emojiga. Those who settled on the plains surrounding Mount Hanang became known as Barabaig ‚Äì Beaters of Sticks (bar = to beat, baig = sticks) because of the importance they place on sticks as a weapon and percussion instrument at dances.Lane, C. 2017 op cit Numbering between 35,000 and 50,000 people (although it is impossible to be sure of population as the Tanzania census does not record ethnicity) they live to this day on the Hanang Plains in Hanang District of Manyara Region of north central Tanzania. Many Barabaig were forcibly evicted from the Basotu Plains in the 1990s to make room for a large-scale wheat-growing project of the Canadian and Tanzanian governments.George Monbiot, monbiot.com Society The Barabaig have no supreme leader or chief (acephalous society). They are organised into clans made up of descendants who can trace their lineage to a single ancestor. Each clan or dosht has a clan head who convenes the clan's affairs through a clan council. There are six spiritual clans (daremng'ajega) and more than 30 secular clans (homatk). Members of all but the blacksmith's clan (Gidang'odiga) must marry outside the clan (exogamy). Blacksmith's must marry within their membership (endogamy), possibly due to a perceived lack of ritual purity.(Lane, C. 2017 op. cit.) Social order is maintained through a series of councils or jural moots that have different authorities; Gitabaraku or public assembly of all Barabaig dealing with community-wide issues, Girgwageda Dosht on clan matters, Girgwageda Gisjeuda for neighbourhood issues, and the Girgwageda Gademg for women to adjudicate on offences by men against women. Serious offences are dealt with in camera and sanctions imposed by a Makchamed made up of selected senior elders(Klima, G. 1970 The Barabaig: East African Cattle Herders, Holt, Rinehart & Winston, New York). The Barabaig live by hunting, farming, and animal husbandry. There is a custom in which they hunt their (or enemies) only with spears, which are: elephants, lions, and other animals. Anyone who does so will be considered a \\"\\" (hero), and is rewarded with gifts of cattle, women, and prestige in his tribe.From \\"National Geographic July 2004, 'Toe-to-Toe with Tanzania's Elephants'\\" Religion - as for all Datooga - are traditional animist beliefs and practices. Fundamentalist U.S. evangelicals have listed the Barabaig and Datooga as \\"unreached peoples\\". Cattle Cattle are central to Barabaig life. They provide milk, meat, and occasionally blood for sustenance, skins for clothing, horns as drinking vessels, dung for building and urine as a cleanser. Cattle are also traded through sale or barter to obtain everything else the Barabaig need. Traditionally, the Barabaig did not grow crops, but they now cultivate farm plots with maize, sorghum and beans. They also grow vegetables in gardens near their homesteads. Whatever is produced is mostly consumed by the household that grows it. The Barabaig also herd sheep and goats, use donkeys as beasts of burden, and keep chickens, although they do not eat eggs. Goats are both traded and slaughtered to eat, and sheep have an important role as sacrifice in rituals. But it is cattle that dominate their lives and influence their culture. Cattle are the currency of life and bind society through inheritance, gifts and loans, payments, fines and sacrifice. A man without cattle can enjoy neither social position nor respect(Lane, C. 2017 op.cit.). Because of the central role played by cattle, it is widely believed the Barabaig attribute greater social importance than economic value to them. This is thought to explain why they often resist selling them ‚Äì something that has thwarted repeated attempts to involve them in the commercial meat trade. It is believed by many that they hoard cattle, but this is a misconception. They keep cattle for milk not meat, and every effort is made to build up the cow herd to maximise milk production. They willingly sell male stock to acquire what they need, but to sell female stock would deplete the breeding herd and limit their means of survival, and there is evidence that collectively they have fewer cattle than is believed(Lane, C 1996 Pastures Lost: Barabaig Economy, Resource Tenure, and the Alienation of their Land in Tanzania, Initiatives, Nairobi) Burial The Barabaig are distinguished from other East African pastoralists by burying esteemed elders in a ritual they call bung'ed. This is the name of the burial mound and the nine-month long ceremony that accompanies it. Before a bung'ed is accorded to an elder (sometimes, but rarely a woman), his clan meet to discuss whether he qualifies by having lived a moral life, had many wives and children, possessed many cattle, and commanded authority through oratory, displayed brave deeds and shown wise judgement. If deemed so, he is buried naked, seated, facing east and a mound build up over the corpse. Thereafter, the site of the burial becomes sacred, carries the deceased's name and is maintained by the clan in perpetuity(Lane, C. 2017 op. cit.). Nomadism The Barabaig are nomadic in that they follow a grazing rotation around the Hanang Plains and beyond. In the dry season, they reside mainly on the Barabaig Plains to the south of Mount Hanang. In the wet season, they moved their herds north up onto the Basotu Plains when there was enough surface water for them to exploit the rich pastures found there they call muhajega. In particularly hard times, they migrate beyond their home range to the great river valleys in the south of the country. Today, migration onto the Basotu Plains is constrained by the alienation of much of their muhajega land by government for a Canadian aid funded wheat scheme(Lane, C. 1996 op. cit.). Loss of land To meet growing domestic demand for wheat in the 1960s, Tanzanian President, Julius Nyerere, personally asked Canadian President, Pierre Trudeau, to help Tanzania increase local wheat production. This resulted in a bi-lateral aid agreement for the Tanzania-Canada Wheat Program that was located on the Basotu Plains where they found ideal growing conditions for wheat. To facilitate the scheme, between 1978 and 1981 the Tanzanian Government summarily alienated 40 hectares of prime grazing land for seven farms, and in doing so disrupted the grazing rotation and evicted many from their lands. This area was held as communal land and like common property elsewhere it presented difficulties for the Barabaig to defend(Lane, C. ed. 1998 Custodians of the Commons: Pastoral Land Tenure in East and West Africa, Earthscan, London). While some herders occupied this land, others only accessed it at certain times in the year, but as they were not there all the time it was thought to belong to no one and regarded as 'vacant' and justifying its taking(Lane, C. 1991 Wheat at What Cost in Conflicts of Interest: Canada and the third World, Between The Lines, Toronto). While no one can own land in Tanzania, they can have customary rights of use over it. As the Barabaig had occupied this area for at least 150 years, they had customary claim to it. In taking it away from them, the Barabaig believed the State was in contravention of their customary rights. They therefore challenged the government's agent, the National Agriculture and Food Corporation (NAFCO) that managed the farms, and mounted a case in the High Court. After an initial judgement in favour of their customary rights in Yoke Gwako & 5 Others v. NAFCO & Gawal Farm (Civil Case No.52 of 1988), the ruling was overturned on appeal through legal technicalities (Tengo, R. & Kakoti, G. 1993 The Barabaig Land Case: Mechanics of state-organised land-grabbing in Tanzania in Veber, H, Dahl, J., Wilson, F., & W√¶hle, E., \\"Never Drink From The Same Cup\\", IWGIA / CDR, Copenhagen). This loss of this land has had an adverse impact on the Barabaig and their pastoral production. Apart from the loss of land, the Barabaig have had to endure the destruction of sacred sites, violation of their human rights with beatings, rapes and summary fines and convictions for trespass on the farms resulting in incarceration. Today, Canada has withdrawn from the project and two of the farms (20,000 acres) have been returned to local Barabaig communities, although this land is also under risk of alienation again(Lane, C. 2017 op.cit.).

The basilica is unique in the region in that it is relatively large with a classical Italian appearance that is atypical for most of northern Europe, let alone a small town in North Brabant. Interior of the Basilica Dutch Papal Zouaves and local Catholics gathered in Oudenbosch and left for Rome in 1868 to defend the Papal State against Giuseppe Garibaldi's Italian nationalist army. Originally a church, it was designated a minor basilica in 1912. A piece of the cloak Pope John Paul II wore during the 1981 assassination attempt is kept there as a relic. Elements inspired by their counterparts in Rome include Michelangelo's Piet√†, Bernini's baldachin, the Chair of Saint Peter, and Bernini's Gloria. References External links * Video of the HH.

Henry Alexander Wise Wood  Elmer Sperry Later, the physicists Arthur Compton, Robert Andrews Millikan and Lee De Forest, inventor of the radio tube and William Lawrence Saunders later replaced Edison as chairman. Initially the board had no legal status, budget or staff, and its mission was unclear. Not until August 1916 did the United States Congress appropriate $25,000 for its operation. The initial publicity surrounding its creation resulted in a flood of suggestions about how to improve the US Navy's ships, totaling 110,000 during the war. The Board's members decided that they could be most effective if they divided into technical committees to utilize their specialist expertise, including the Committee on Aeronautics and Aeronautical Motors. They provided consultants and arranged for research to be carried out in established civilian laboratories. During World War I, the board was responsible for approving camouflage schemes for civilian ships, including one invented by William MacKay. One of the most significant committees was that on Industrial Preparedness, which drew up an inventory of manufacturing capacity and sought to develop common manufacturing standards. On 10 February 1917 the Board established a Special Problems Committee with a Subcommittee on Submarine Detection by Sound. This led to the collaboration of the Submarine Signal Company, engaged in acoustic research and producer of submarine signals devices since 1901, the Western Electric Company and General Electric Company in experiments on the problem. An experimental station was established at Nahant, Massachusetts.The Submarine Signal Company, H J Fay, Soundings, publication of the Submarine Signal Company, Boston, November 1944 On May 11, 1917 the United States Secretary of the Navy created a Special Board on Antisubmarine Detection \\"for the purpose of procuring either through original research, experiment and manufacture, or through development of ideas and devices submitted by inventors at large, suitable apparatus for both offensive and defensive operations against submarines\\".

A cross-country rider on singletrack during a race. An example of doubletrack. Singletrack (or single track) describes a type of mountain biking trail that is approximately the width of the bike. It contrasts with double-track or fire road which is wide enough for four-wheeled off-road vehicles. It is often smooth and flowing, but may also feature technical rocky sections, go over tree roots, and include berms, banked turns, switch-backs, hills, drops, jumps, and so forth. Singletrack which descends significantly, and in the most downward direction, is said to be following the fall line.https://rootsrated.com Farlow Gap - Mountain Biking: fall line (2nd paragraph) ‚Äî \\"The trail becomes loose and rocky, and becomes fall line into a wide open rock garden...\\" Many mountain bike riders prefer singletrack over other types of trails, as singletrack is usually designed specifically for the sport, and therefore can have elements which highlight features of the sport (whereas other trail types will usually be more straight, and not exhibit as many hills and other special features).https://www.youtube.com Dupont State Forest - Ridgeline Trail (singletrack).https://www.trailforks.com Technical Trail Features. Some singletrack includes TTF's (technical trail features) designed to challenge riders, such as log piles, log rides, skinnies, rock gardens, gap jumps, and wall-rides. Doubletrack (or double track) contrasts with singletrack in that it has two paths, which are approximately parallel. Jeep trails and fire roads are examples of a doubletrack trail. Trail building There are often volunteers, both organized and informal, that maintain and create singletrack in many places. Organized volunteers coordinate with park districts or land owners to modify the natural woods or terrain to accommodate singletrack bikers. Some paths are created from scratch, while others are modified hiking paths. In one report, the USDA highlights several potential problems when it comes to trail building: effects on natural resources, use of designated wilderness, conflict with other users, and notable safety issues. These regulations are devised to make mountain biking sustainable; the IMBA strives to promote mountain biking in a way that trails made are done so according to previously ordained regulations and the idea that if built properly, trail maintenance and environmental impact will be minimal. In one example, Singletrack Advocates (STA) is a nonprofit organization that strives to build and maintain singletrack around Anchorage. Since its beginnings in 2007, STA has prevailed in legislation and construction of over 20 miles of new trails in the Anchorage area (Alaska). Trail maintenance In 2000, Clemson University (South Carolina, U.S.) Department of Crop, Soil and Environmental Sciences conducted a study on mountain biking and the sustainability of the sport as it relates to the natural environment. The researchers outlined four capacities that must be met in order to sustain a trail or trail system: Physical Capacity, the amount of space a given activity demands, Ecological Capacity, how much damage the environment can withstand before detrimental effect, Facility Capacity, what a given population needs in order to enjoy such recreational areas; and Social Capacity, the point at which one decides how many users the trail can accommodate comfortably at any one time. Mountain biking is a sustainable sport in that once a trail or trail system is made, it can be used for many years, but like accommodating for specific carrying capacities, there are many concerns in maintenance and use. Resource managers, typically employed by private or federal agencies, are in position to make judgment on how and when trail maintenance needs to be done. Resource managers take care of outstanding trail conditions such as the following: erosion control, trail widening and or rutting, shortcuts, soil decomposition, damage to drainage structures, damage to flora, fauna and water structures. In order to preserve the sustainability and progress the mountain biking community has seen in the most recent of years, trail maintenance must be continual, from being proactive in legislation, to environmental awareness in physical maintenance.  \\"Rules of the Trail\\"  The IMBA has developed a set of rules \\"to promote responsible and courteous conduct on shared-use trails.\\" Every trail may have a slightly different set of rules. Most commonly, the rules include provisions such as the following:https://www.imba.com/rules-trail IMBA \\"Rules of the Trail\\". * Mountain bikers must yield to both hikers and riders on horses (equestrians), unless the trail is clearly designated and marked for bike-only travel. Hikers yield to equestrians. * Downhill riders yield to uphill riders (unless the trail is clearly marked for one-way or downhill-only traffic). * \\"Leave No Trace\\" - Mountain bikers should ride in a way that does not cause damage or ecological erosion to the trail. Riders should not cut switchbacks. If there is standing water, riders should not ride around it if it causes erosion at the side, or will cause the trail to become wider. Littering is never acceptable. Other rules are often posted for the considerations of specific individual trails.

Although he lived much of his adult life elsewhere, he maintained his connection to the region both in his artwork and research, and later with his plan to purchase the \\"Rock House\\" in Beulah, Alabama.  Influences  During childhood Brown was close with his grandparents, especially his great-grandmother, Mammy. This experience instilled an early interest in his family's origins, later inspiring extensive research into his family's genealogy. This research was expressed artistically in a number of paintings that track family relationships, most notably \\"Autobiography in the Shape of Alabama (Mammy ºs Door)\\" and in references to Elvis Presley, who was a distant cousin. His upbringing in the southern United States also led to a deep interest in the material culture of the South, especially in folk art and hand made, functional objects. From his adolescent and teen years he took influences from the aesthetics of comics, theatre, architecture and interiors and streamlined Art Deco and machine-age design. Additionally, the influence of his religious upbringing in the independent, fundamentalist Church of Christ was formative and lasting. While attending the School of the Art Institute Chicago (SAIC) from 1962 to 1970, Brown was introduced to a range of art historical periods and genres, gravitating to Pre-Renaissance Italian art, Surrealism, American artists Edward Hopper, Grant Wood, and Georgia O'Keeffe, and the tribal art of many cultures. Painter Ray Yoshida and art historian Whitney Halstead, both professors at SAIC, also greatly influenced Brown's practice. Both included folk, popular, and self-taught art within the scope of their teaching, genres which Brown sustained enthusiastic interest in throughout his life. Other influences stemming from Brown's SAIC days include the legendary Maxwell Street market, antique and thrift stores, and amusement parks. Travel was also a source for inspiration and subject matter throughout Brown's artistic career; experiences throughout the U.S.‚Äîwhere he took frequent road trips‚Äîand in Mexico, Europe, Russia, and Africa found expression in both his paintings and in his collections. Brown became known as an astute and intuitive collector, a practice he began during childhood. His collections inspired much of his work throughout his thirty-odd year career. His Chicago collection is preserved, as he left it, at the Roger Brown Study Collection of the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. The RBSC archive contains materials from Brown's collections from homes in New Buffalo, MI, and La Conchita, CA.  Collecting  Collected art and objects functioned as important source materials for Brown's work and were an integral part of his practice and discipline. Collecting was a pursuit shared by many of his Chicago colleagues, and reflected a collecting sensibility in Chicago. Brown didn't claim to be a curator, but felt that objects would gravitate towards like objects, establishing visual and associative dialogues along the way. Brown's collection includes the work of many of his friends and colleagues including Ray Yoshida, Karl Wirsum, Barbara Rossi, Jim Nutt, Don Baum, and Christina Ramberg, among others. Brown collected works by a vast array of self-taught artists including 36 works by Joseph Yoakum, a major work by Henry Darger, birdhouse cathedrals by Aldo Piacenza, hand painted text works by Jesse Howard, and many others. Artworks and objects from outside America reflect Brown's travels and aesthetic interests. These include Yoruba twin figures, Baule masks, Guerrero masks, Hopi katsina, molas, and many other objects from very diverse locations and traditions. The display of these objects was influenced by Chicago Imagist artist Ray Yoshida's display technique, utilizing simple white shelves densely populated with wide-ranging objects. It is notable that Brown displayed all of the objects in his collection as holding equal value no matter their background or provenance. Today this democratic treatment of objects is continued at the RBSC, with each object treated as a museum artifact.  Education  After graduating from high school in 1960 Brown attended David Lipscomb College in Nashville, TN, where he briefly pursued his interest in entering the ministry. In the fall of 1962 Brown moved to Chicago where he took classes at the American Academy of Art before enrolling at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC). His first experience at SAIC was brief, and in 1963 he returned to the American Academy of Art, where he completed a commercial design program in 1964. He then returned to SAIC as a full-time student from 1965 to 1970, where he committed to a fine art focus that would lead to his prolific career over the next three decades. In 1968 Brown received his Bachelor of Fine Art and in 1970 he was awarded his Master of Fine Art, both from SAIC. With his MFA Brown also received Edward L. Ryerson Traveling Fellowship, which supported travels throughout Europe and Egypt, where he collected objects, images, and inspiration.  Early career  Brown developed a mature visual vocabulary in the late 1960s, with visual themes including silhouetted figures, nocturnal cityscapes, and theatre facades and interiors. Encouraged by Yoshida and Halsted, Brown and his colleagues began to look to the work of self-taught artists, visiting Joseph Yoakum, Aldo Piacenza, William Dawson, Lee Godie, and others. Brown became an ardent champion for the validity of such works as equal or superior to works from the mainstream. Exploring and documenting art environments and the vernacular landscape became an ongoing pursuit.  Mid- career  Brown's first solo exhibit at Phyllis Kind Gallery (Chicago, 1971) began his 26-year representation at PKG in Chicago (beginning in 1970) and New York (beginning in 1975). Although affiliated with the Chicago Imagist school throughout his career, Brown's work evolved beyond the indeterminate definition of that \\"school.\\" In the early 1970s he received acclaim for his paintings of stylized landscapes and cityscapes as stark backdrops for aspects of contemporary life as well as the \\"Disasters\\" series (1972), paintings of exploding buildings, followed by a procession of iconic, flat-patterned landscapes. Brown's critical acclaim grew in the 1970s and 1980s. He became known for responding to 20th-century life through works that addressed a range of subjects and issues: natural, architectural and urban landscapes, the dichotomy of nature and culture, disasters of all types, current and political events, social, religious, and popular culture, autobiographical, personal, and sexual issues, the art world in many guises, cosmology, mortality, history, mythology, transformation, transportation, and the weather. He used the weather as an allegorical backdrop for the larger physical and metaphysical forces that dwarf the human endeavor. In addition to painting and printmaking, Brown's mediums eventually included sculpture of found, assembled, and painted objects, theatre and opera sets, and mosaic murals. In 1979 he designed sets for the Chicago Opera Theatre's production of Mozart's \\"Cosi fan Tutte.\\" = Chicago Imagists = Early on, Brown, along with many of his colleagues, was recognized by curator Don Baum, who organized spirited \\"Chicago School\\" exhibitions at the Hyde Park Art Center from 1966 to 1971. Brown's work was shown there in the group exhibition \\"False Image\\" (1968, 69). From these early HPAC exhibitions, a loosely associated group of artists became known as Chicago Imagists, a term coined by art critic Franz Schulz (1972). They did not form a group, adopt the name, or have a shared ideology, but they did work independently of New York contemporary art trends and incorporated imagery from popular culture into their works, although less cerebrally than New York Pop artists.  Later career  In the late 1980s Brown adapted his work and collecting disciplines to Southern California, moving into a home and studio (designed by Stanley Tigerman) in La Conchita, in 1993. Still addressing a broad range of subjects in his works, Brown created condensed, serial works that focused on California experiences, including a series of ominous cloud-scapes, paintings of rose trees and shrubs; a series of Virtual Still Life object paintings (27 paintings with projecting shelves holding ceramic objects); and metaphorical explorations of Bonsai, his final sequence. In 1991 Brown created two Italian glass mosaic murals entitled \\"Arts and Sciences of the Ancient World: The Flight of Daedalus\\" and \\"Icarus and Arts and Sciences of the Modern World: La Salle Corridor with Holding Pattern\\". These were installed on the fa√ßade and in the lobby of the Ahmanson Commercial Development Company, a subsidiary of Home Savings of America, at 120 North LaSalle St., Chicago. His second large scale mural was the \\"City of the Big Shoulders\\" commissioned by The Equitable for the NBC building at Cityfront Center, Chicago and located in the west lobby of the 455 North Columbus Building. His third (untitled) mosaic mural is a tribute to the African burial ground, discovered during the excavation for the Ted Weiss Federal Building at 290 Broadway, New York City, dedicated in 1995. In September 1997 the mosaic mural \\"Hull House, Cook County, Howard Brown: A Tradition of Helping\\", designed by Brown, was dedicated at the Howard Brown Health Center in Chicago.  Exhibitions  Brown's exhibition history is extensive. He was represented by the Phyllis Kind Gallery in Chicago and New York, and his work was shown in numerous solo and group exhibitions in museums and galleries around the country and abroad. Major retrospectives of his work were mounted at the Montgomery Museum of Fine Arts in 1980, and at The Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in 1987. He is represented in many major museum collections including the Art Institute of Chicago, Museum of Contemporary Art (Chicago), Metropolitan Museum of Art, Whitney Museum of American Art, Museum of Modern Art, Corcoran Gallery of Art, High Museum of Art, Milwaukee Art Museum, and the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art.  Homes  Brown owned homes, studios, and gardens in Chicago, Illinois; New Buffalo, Michigan; and La Conchita, California. He was in the process of developing his final home and studio in Beulah, Alabama at the time of his death. The School of the Art Institute Chicago became the primary repository for Brown's personal, professional, and artistic effects. SAIC operates his New Buffalo, MI retreat as a residency facility for SAIC faculty and staff. His Chicago collection was formalized into the Roger Brown Study Collection, a house museum, archive, and special collection in 1997. = Chicago = In 1974 Brown purchased a storefront in Chicago at 1926 North Halsted Street, which became his first home, studio, and collection environment. This home is owned by the School of the Art Institute Chicago and is maintained as the Roger Brown Study Collection, a house museum and special collection, serving SAIC as an academic resource, and is open to the public by appointment. = Michigan = Brown commissioned his partner, architect George Veronda, to design a home and studio for a Lake Michigan dunes property he purchased in New Buffalo, Michigan. The Veronda Pavilion, a residence, and the Roger Brown Studio and Guest House were completed in 1979. Throughout the 1980s Brown divided his time between Chicago and New Buffalo, where he assembled a second collection of art and objects, and developed a garden. The pavilion and studio/guest house are steel and glass modernist structures tucked into a secluded dunes landscape between the Galien River and a beachfront road. Parallels can be drawn between Veronda's design these buildings and Mies van der Rohe's Farnsworth House (Plano, IL, 1950). The Pavilion and Guest House contain furnishings designed by Veronda, as well as Brown's collection, including works by contemporary artists, tribal sculpture and textiles, works by folk and self-taught artists, and examples of Brown's own work. Brown's Michigan home and studio provided him with a new source of inspiration not previously available to him in the city: nature and a continually changing landscape. Here is where Brown first began experimenting with landscape design, surrounding the buildings with a swath of native grasses and flowers, and later planting several hundred rose shrubs. He also installed sculptures including a large sheet metal cross, reproduction Roman busts, sundry architectural ornaments, sculptures by \\"Joe the Welder\\", and other objects. In 1995 Brown gave his New Buffalo property to SAIC with the intention that it serve as a retreat for SAIC faculty and staff. The Studio, Pavilion and Guest House have been used since 1996 by SAIC faculty and full-time staff, who may apply for two-week residencies through the faculty enrichment and sabbatical programs. In Spring 2007 SAIC's Historic Landscape Studio class (offered through SAIC's Historic Preservation graduate program), taught by Carol Yetken, undertook a project to research the landscape history of New Buffalo property, and create a preservation plan. The New Buffalo facility is used by SAIC faculty and staff year-round and is not open to the public. = California = In the late 1980s Brown searched for a place to live on the west coast. He found property in the beach town of La Conchita, north of Ventura, with a Spartan \\"Royal Mansion\\" trailer. In 1993 home and studio, designed by architect Stanley Tigerman, was completed. Though he originally planned to live in the trailer and build a studio alongside it, in the final plans the trailer served as a guest house. The architecture for the main home studio structure, which he referred to as the \\"Temple of Painting,\\" was conceived as part barn, part basilica, with a Romanesque clerestory, corrugated roof, and stucco painted a deep salmon-pink, inspired by the color of the La Purisima Mission in nearby Lompoc. An important feature of the La Conchita house‚Äîand one that was specifically stipulated by Brown in all of his homes‚Äîwas the presence of a large expanse of white walls on which he could display his collection. As with his other homes, Brown filled this house and garden with collected objects‚Äîwell over 1,500 in total by the time he bequeathed the estate to SAIC‚Äîreferred to in scholarly material as his La Conchita Collection. The breadth of objects included was comparable to his other collections, with everything from formal paintings to African objects to everyday objects. However the La Conchita collection can be seen to reflect his California environment, featuring an extensive array of nearly 500 ceramic objects featuring objects by amateurs, regional factory-made wares, and Mexican wares by families or studios. The contents and direction of this collection was guided both by Brown's own exploration of the environment and by the network of friends and colleagues he established in California, namely his friend Lisa Cathcart, Director of Casa Dolores, Center for the Study of the Popular Arts of Mexico. Brown bequeathed the La Conchita home and collection to SAIC in 1997. The house has since been sold, and much of the collection has been archived. Brown's Spartan trailer now resides at the Museum of Jurassic Technology in Culver City, California (along with a collection of similar mobile residences). In addition to Brown's original furnishings and decor, the Spartan now also showcases a series of models depicting different views of the trailer made by artist, SAIC Associate Professor and RBSC Curator Nicholas Lowe. Surrounding the trailer in its new location is a reconstruction of part of Brown's La Conchita garden. Portions of Brown's La Conchita garden are also replicated at Casa Dolores. = Alabama = In 1997 Brown was in the process of developing a fourth home/studio/collection environment in an 1870s stone house in Beulah, Alabama, with the vision of \\"coming full circle\\" and have his Alabama home. This house, known as the Rock House, was only 15 miles from his parents' home in Alabama. Brown first documented the Rock House on super-8 film as a child. Upon purchasing the Rock House as an adult, Brown sent all the furnishings‚Äì‚Äìthe beginnings of another collection‚Äì‚Äìof rugs, quilts, and examples of his own work to his brother Greg Brown, for installation into the house. Brown died on November 22, 1997. The project was completed by his parents and brother, and opened as the Roger Brown Rock House Museum in 1999. The family added to Brown's collection of objects for the Alabama house after his death, contributing personal artifacts and family memorabilia.  Personal life  Roger Brown was a gay man. In 1972 he met architect George Veronda (1941‚Äì1984) and the two formed a strong artistic and romantic relationship. Veronda was diagnosed with lung cancer in 1983 and died in 1984. Brown frequented venues like The Gold Coast, one of Chicago's first gay leather bars, and included elements of cruising culture in some of his paintings. Brown was diagnosed as HIV positive in 1988 and by 1993 was living with AIDS. Themes related to the HIV/AIDS pandemic appeared in Brown's work in the 1980s and continued throughout the rest of his career although he never wished to be a \\"one note artist\\" and continued to draw subject matter from almost every aspect of 20th century American culture. Despite experiencing painful side effects from medications and periods of hospitalization, the final years of Brown's life were some of his most productive. Between 1993 and 1997, Brown completed more than eighty paintings, and planned and executed home, studio, and garden designs. One of Brown's final large scale projects was a mosaic for the Howard Brown Health Center, a Chicago organization that provides healthcare to LGBTQ individuals. Roger Brown died on November 22, 1997, and was survived by his parents, James and Mary Elizabeth Brown and his brother Greg Brown. Brown was honored posthumously by the Chicago Commission on Human Relations' Advisory Council on Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Issues and was inducted into the LGBT Hall of Fame in 2004. Brown's work was featured in the exhibitions Roger Brown: This Boy's Own Story, curated by Kate Pollasch, and a project of the Roger Brown Study Collection and Art AIDS America Chicago, a landmark exhibition which explored the way the AIDS crisis impacted art and culture.  Other  In 2004 Roger Brown was inducted into the Chicago Gay and Lesbian Hall of Fame.

It was first broadcast on Tuesday 1 October 1991. Synopsis With Eddie having spent most of their remaining ¬£11.80 on a second-hand copy of Parade magazine, he and Richie spend a night watching Miss World on the television. Plot The episode begins with Richie placing his head in the oven in a suicide attempt. He has left a suicide note on the table for Eddie to read. It is revealed that this is in fact a ploy to guilt-trip Eddie into buying him a drink. Eddie enters the room, places his briefcase on top of the note and proceeds to read the newspaper. When he notices Richie with his head in the oven, he shrugs indifferently, and Richie relents. It emerges that while Eddie has been out all day trying to claim his dole money, Richie has spent all day making an inexpensive dinner for the pair (everything has been grown, found or foraged), which turns out to be inedible. Eddie refuses to eat the dinner and reveals he has been denied his dole as he has too many savings - ¬£11.80, which ought to last him two months - but he's \\"invested\\" the majority of it in a secondhand copy of Parade magazine. Eddie sits down to watch the Miss World contest on TV, but Richie refuses to let him. The two have an argument and Richie throws Eddie out of the flat. He then settles down to masturbate while watching Miss World. Eddie, who has been preparing to apologise to Richie, catches Richie in the act and agrees to keep it a secret if he is allowed to return and watch Miss World. Later, Richie puts two and two together when he realizes that Eddie has only 30p left, and yet the Parade copy only cost ¬£1.50 of his ¬£11.80, which should leave him ¬£10.30. When Richie confronts Eddie, he reveals he has also placed a Miss World bet. Richie is less than impressed when he finds out Eddie has placed the money on the hideous, apparently ancient Chinese contestant, as he felt the odds were so good. The pair must then deal with changing a fuse when Richie breaks the television. In the ensuing chaos, Richie is electrocuted, burns his hand on the kettle several times (exclaiming \\"I didn't think the kettle would be hot!\\") and falls out of the window. When Eddie fixes the lights, he notices Richie is gone. Only now does he find the suicide note and assumes Richie has killed himself. After briefly mourning his friend, he begins planning to sell all of his possessions. Richie returns and the two discuss their state in the world. Eddie states his philosophy on life: \\"You get born, you keep your head down and you die. If you're lucky.\\" Their contestant loses Miss World, and Richie is further depressed. Eddie reveals that he never placed the bet anyway; he only claimed to have done it so Richie would insist they watch Miss World. Eddie had instead spent the money on a \\"slap-up grill\\" as he saw Richie preparing \\"dinner\\" when he left that morning. The episode ends with Richie punching Eddie in the face. Notes *This episode was filmed in 1989 and was originally the pilot. As a result there are several differences in the set, such as the piano being against the \\"fourth\\" wall and the stairs ascending in the opposite direction. Rik Mayall has shorter hair and Ade Edmondson has more hair and is lacking sideburns. *This is one of three episodes to feature only Richie and Eddie, the others being Culture and Hole. *This episode is omitted from some European DVD box sets. Errors *It is revealed that the flat belongs to Richie's Auntie Mabel and that Eddie is Richie's sub-tenant, though he has never paid rent. However, from 's Up onwards, the pair have a landlord, Mr. Harrison. Auntie Mabel isn't mentioned again until Weapons Grade Y-Fronts Tour, when Richie mentions that his \\"auntie pays the rent.\\" *The vintage magazine Eddie is holding when he is standing in the hallway is placed with the front cover facing the viewer. When he re-enters the room, the shot that follows immediately, the magazine is suddenly reversed with the back of the sleeve now facing the audience.

In the spring the underground stems produce compound leaves that are large and finely toothed. Tiny white flowers, typically in three, globe-shaped clusters wide, are produced on tall scapes that grow about the same height as the leaves. These bloom from May to July and develop into purple-black edible berries. The leaves go dormant in summer before the fruits ripen. The berries taste a little spicy and sweet. The stem of the plant grows straight up from the ground and divides into a whorl of 3 stems which branch up and out, each forming 3 to 7 (most often 5) pinnately compound leaflets; leaflets ovate, acute, serrate, green.Thomas A. Naegele, DO from his 1970s book Edible and Medicinal Plants of the Great lakes Technically, all the leaflets on one plant are considered to be one entire leaf, and the stems that connect the leaflets are called rachis; this arrangement is called doubly compound. In some cases some of the leaflets are further completely subdivided, forming a triply compound pattern. This species is similar to Aralia hispida (Bristly Sarsaparilla), which is a little larger with stems covered with bristly hairs, hence the name. The stems of A. nudicaulis are smooth. The roots have been used as substitutes for true Sarsaparilla (Smilax sp.) in herbal medicine. This plant is so common in certain ecologies that it is an indicator species for these Eastern Forests of North America: Northern Hardwood Forest, Beech-Maple Forest, and Oak-Hickory Forest.A Field Guide to Eastern Forests; 1988, 1998; John C. Kricher; Easton Press; Houghton Mifflin Company. Also common in the Interior Cedar Hemlock forest ecosystem in central and southern British Columbia.

Muzzle flash is the visible light of a muzzle blast, which is caused by the sudden release and expansion of high-temperature, high- pressure gases from the muzzle of a firearm. The blast and flash are caused by the combustion products of the gunpowder, and any remaining unburned powder, mixing with the ambient air. The size and shape of the muzzle flash is dependent on the combustion energy of propellant being used, the amount of combustible ejecta remaining, and any devices attached to the muzzle (such as a muzzle brake, flash hider or suppressor). Muzzle blast Soldiers covering their ears while firing a 120-mm mortar The muzzle blast is the explosive shockwave caused by rapid expansion of propellant gases when the pressure seal within the barrel previously maintained by the projectile is suddenly removed as the said projectile leaves the muzzle. The blast is often broken down into two components, an auditory componentMuzzle Blast Sound Intensity, Firearm Sound Pressure Level and a non-auditory component. Blast Overpressure Studies. Nonauditory Damage Risk Assessment for Simulated Muzzle Blast from a l2Omm Ml2l Mortar System. (abstract) The auditory component is the sound of the gunshot, and is important because it can cause significant hearing loss to surrounding personnel and also give away the gun's position. The non-auditory component is the infrasonic compression wave, and can cause shock damage to nearby items. =Gun sound= The sound of a gunshot, also known as the muzzle report, may have two sources: the muzzle blast itself, and any shockwave produced by a transonic or supersonic projectile. Suppressors help to reduce the muzzle report of firearms by providing a larger area for the propellant gas to expand, decelerate and cool before release sound energy into the surrounding. =Compression wave= The overpressure wave from a firearm's muzzle blast can contain a significant amount of energy because it travels at an extremely high velocity. Residual pressures at the muzzle can be a significant fraction of the peak bore pressure, especially when short barrels are used. This energy can also be harnessed by a muzzle brake to reduce the recoil of the firearm, or by a muzzle booster to provide energy to cycle the action of self-loading firearms. =Problems caused by muzzle blast= Muzzle blasts can easily exceed sound pressure levels of 140 decibels, which can cause permanent hearing loss even with brief and infrequent exposure.Hearing protection FAQ With large guns such as artillery, that danger can extend outwards a significant distance from the muzzle. Prediction of Standoff Distances to Prevent Loss of Hearing from Muzzle Blast The force of the muzzle blast can cause shock damage to items near the muzzle, and with artillery, the energy is sufficiently large to cause severe damage to surrounding structures and vehicles. Muzzle Blast Damage to Combat Vehicles (abstract) It furthermore can violently raise dust and debris when firing rifles from prone position and so give away the position. Preventive actions may consist in wetting dry ground or covering the area around the muzzle with a tarpaulin. Muzzle flash Muzzle flash of a revolver. Note the minor flash at the gap between cylinder and barrel. The muzzle flash refers to the light emitted by the muzzle blast‚Äîboth visible and infrared‚Äîcaused by the high heat and pressure. =Muzzle flash characteristics= Muzzle flash can be broken down into five distinct components.Tony DiGiulian, Muzzle flash, 14 August 2006 *The muzzle glow is a reddish glow that is visible before the bullet leaves the barrel. It glow is created by superheated gases that have leaked past the projectile and have exited the barrel ahead of it. *The primary flash is caused by superheated propellant gases exiting the firearm behind the projectile, which radiates its energy to the surroundings partly as visible light. Although amongst the brightest of the flashes, the heat of the primary flash dissipates very quickly, and thus is usually not distinctly noticeable. *The intermediate flash is caused by shock waves created by the high speeds of the escaping gases and projectile, and appears as a reddish disc shape in front of the muzzle. *The secondary flash appears farthest from the muzzle as a large white or yellow flame, and is caused by the re-ignition oxidative reaction of incompletely combusted ejecta when mixed with abundant oxygen in the surrounding atmosphere.G. Klingenberg, Gun Muzzle Blast and Flash, 21 July 1988 *Following the dissipation of the muzzle flash, partially unburnt powder or other heated materials can be further ejected from the muzzle and appear as airborne residual sparks. =Suppression= Muzzle flash, particularly the long duration secondary flash, is an inherent problem in most firearms. Due to its brightness, muzzle flash can temporarily blind the shooter, or give away the shooter's location, especially at night. Ingestion of the muzzle flash from aircraft mounted guns has also been implicated in compressor stall and flameout, causing loss of aircraft. Flash suppressors attempt to suppress the flash mechanically, by interfering with the shock wave using either a cone or a series of slots at the muzzle of the firearm. However, since the primary cause of the secondary flash is combustion of hydrogen and carbon monoxide, chemical approaches are also used. In World War I, bags of sodium chloride (table salt) were placed in front of the propellant charges of artillery to suppress the flash. Addition of a few percent of alkali salts to the powder for flash suppression is common, typically salts of potassium such as potassium chloride, potassium sulfate, potassium carbonate, and potassium bicarbonate. In both cases, the salts act as catalysts, and interfere with the hydrogen-oxygen combustion to reduce the muzzle flash. The side effects of the alkali salts are a reduction in power, an increase in smoke, and fouling and corrosion of the firearm and nearby equipment (a significant concern with aircraft guns). Ammonium chloride and ammonium nitrate salts have also been tried with success. Detection, with muzzle blast Gunfire locators detect muzzle blast with microphones and triangulate the location where the shots were fired. They are commercially available, and have been installed in many high-crime areas of large cities. They provide a fairly precise location of the source of a shot fired outdoors--99% to within or better--and can provide it to police within seconds of a firing. Muzzle flashes create distinct signatures that can be located using infrared imaging technology. Infrared sniper detection enhancement Technology is being developed to detect enemy muzzle flashes before the projectile reaches its target.

The editor placed emphasis on promoting nationalistic feelings and opposing the autocratic functioning of the government. Kunhirama was highly impressed with the working of Amrita Bazar Pathrika of Calcutta newspaper. It is said this was the first congress newspaper in Malayalam. Kerala Pathrika was published for a long time. After a short interruption in 1930 the paper resumed publication in 1938. Later this newspaper continued publication from Cochin in 1947.

In Russian villages, the seven weeks after Easter were a time of festivity, and Green Week took place during the seventh week leading up to Pentecost. Green Week is followed by Trinity Week () in Russia, which also called Whitsuntide week in Britain. The end of Semik inaugurated the celebrations of Trinity Sunday, which came three days later.  Observance  The Thursday of Green Week was called Semik and included burial services for the unclean dead (those who had died before their time). On Semik, funeral rites were held for the unclean dead. Birch trees were particularly significant to the holiday, because they were considered hosts for the souls of the deceased. Sometimes people would honor a particular tree by decorating it or carrying it around, while other times people would cut birch branches and hang them in their home. The birch was also seen as a symbol of vegetative power, and may have been honored with the hope of bringing its vitality to the coming season's crops. Springtime and fertility rituals were also important to the holiday. Girls brought offerings of fried eggs (a symbol of rebirth) and beer to birches, and spoke charms about improved harvest when weaving garlands for the trees. Another tradition is for girls to pledge vows of friendship before the chosen birch tree. Some believe this to be the remnant of ritual sexual activity associated with the cult of spring. Like Kostroma during Maslenitsa, a chosen birch tree was destroyed at the end of the festivities. Usually, it was drowned \\"in order to provide the needed rainfall for the sprouting crops\\"Joanna Hubbs. Mother Russia: The Feminine Myth in Russian Culture. Indiana University Press, 1998. . Page 73..  Association with rusalka  The rusalki nature spirits were another important figure to Green Week traditions. Some believe they were associated with deceased family members, or perhaps only unclean dead. Sometimes an honored birch tree would be named for a rusalka as part of Green Week. Some of the rites of Green Week (like making offerings of eggs and garlands) were thought to placate the rusalki so they would stay away from the village's agricultural fields for the season and thus not bring them harm. The rusalki are also associated with water and fertility, and so may be invoked during Green Week in an attempt to bring their moisture and vigor to the fields. During Green Week, rusalki were believed to be more active, making them a greater threat to villagers. One precaution villagers took during this week was avoiding swimming, because rusalki were thought to live in the water and might drown passers by.  Related observances  There is a similar holiday celebrating Pentecost in Romania, called Rusalii. Also in Germanic tradition there is a similar tradition, for example, Pfingstbaumpflanzen in Germany. In modern-day Poland it is celebrated along with Pentecostal Sunday as Zielone ≈öwiƒÖtki.

It is native to eastern North America, with a range extending from eastern and central Canada (from Nova Scotia to Manitoba) through the northeastern deciduous and mixed forests of New England and the Great Lakes region and south along the Appalachians as far as the northeastern corner of Georgia, and west as far as Minnesota, Missouri and Arkansas. The flowers appear in the late summer to early fall and show ray florets that are usually either a deep lavender or violet, but sometimes white, and disc florets that are cream-coloured or light yellow, becoming purple as they mature. It is one of the parent species of the hybrid Eurybia √ó herveyi. Distribution and habitat Eurybia macrophylla is native to southern parts of eastern and central Canada and to northern parts of the eastern and central United States, south to northern Georgia in the Appalachian Mountains. In Canada, it is common in Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island. In the United States, it can be found in all states east of and including Minnesota, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri and Tennessee. It may also be present in Mississippi. The plant has also been introduced outside of its native range into northern Europe. It is most often encountered at 0 to 1300 metre (0‚Äì4300 feet) elevations in moist to dry soils in association with hemlock-northern hardwood, beech-maple or pine forests, Appalachian spruce-fir forests, as well as with aspen, pine or open spruce woodlands. It can also be found in thickets, clearings or along shaded roadsides. Conservation status within the United States It is listed as endangered in Iowa and as a special concern in Rhode Island. Uses The large, thick young leaves can be cooked and eaten as greens. The Algonquin people of Quebec use the leaves in this way. The Iroquois use the root as a blood medicine, and they also use a compound decoction of the roots to loosen the bowels to treat venereal disease. The Ojibwa bathe their heads with an infusion of this plant to treat headaches. They also smoke it as hunting charm to attract deer. They consume the young leaves of the plant as both food and medicine, and use the roots to make soup. References =Bibliography=   External links * Flora, fauna, earth, and sky...

C.14 was an American pianist known for his reserved, elegant style and sophisticated interpretations of Bach and Scarlatti and for his collaboration with the American composer Samuel Barber. Biography Browning was born to musical parents in Denver, Colorado, in 1933. He studied piano from age 3 with his mother and, at the age of 10, was accepted as a student by Rosina Lh√©vinne. He appeared as a soloist with the Denver Symphony Orchestra later that same year. In 1945 his family moved to Los Angeles, California. He spent two years at Occidental College there. He began his studies at the Juilliard School in New York with Rosina Lh√©vinne in 1950. He won the Leventritt Competition in 1955 and made his professional orchestral debut with the New York Philharmonic in 1956. At this point his career came under the management of well known talent manager Herbert Barrett, later signing with Columbia Artists Management Inc. in the early 1990s. As early as 1960, Browning had already emerged as a featured soloist in the prime-time CBS Television network special Spring Festival of Music. His appearance with the conductor Alfredo Antonini and the Symphony of the Air featured a virtuoso performance from Sergei Rachmaninoff's Second Piano Concerto which was noted for its musical excellence and its imaginative visual presentation on television.

He subsequently made a commercial recording of the work for Columbia with George Szell conducting the Cleveland Orchestra. His second recording of the work, with Leonard Slatkin and the Saint Louis Symphony Orchestra in 1991 for RCA Victor, won a Grammy Award for best instrumental soloist with orchestra. In 1993 Browning won a second Grammy Award for best instrumental soloist without orchestra for a disc of Barber's solo works on MusicMasters. He continued to follow the works of contemporary American composers but found relatively few to his liking. Browning developed a busy career, giving some 100 concerts a season. He eased his schedule in the 1970s, explaining later that he had grown ragged from overwork. In the 1990s, his career had something of a renaissance. His last public appearance was at the National Gallery of Art in Washington in April 2002. His last performance of all was to an invited audience at the United States Supreme Court in May 2002. He died (from heart failure) at the age of 69 some eight months later in Sister Bay, Wisconsin. Legacy John Browning is remembered for his penetrating, intellectual interpretations of Bach, Haydn, Mozart, and Scarlatti, among others, and for his many recordings of the works of these and other composers. Browning recorded for RCA Victor, Columbia Records, Capitol Records, Delos and MusicMasters Records.

The 366th Fighter Wing (366 FW) is a fighter wing of the United States Air Force Air Combat Command stationed at Mountain Home Air Force Base, Idaho. Units The wing comprises four groups: the 366th Operations Group, 366th Maintenance Group, 366th Mission Support Group and 366th Medical Group. The wing is home to three fighter squadrons: the 389th Fighter Squadron and 391st Fighter Squadron flying the F-15E Strike Eagle aircraft and the 428th Fighter Squadron which flies the Republic of Singapore Air Force F-15F (aka F-15SG). Until September 2010, a fourth squadron, the 390th Fighter Squadron flew the F-15C Eagle in an air superiority mission. The 417th Tactical Fighter Squadron which flew F-4D Phantoms and later F-111's. In September 2010 the redesignated 390th Electronic Combat Squadron assumed the mission of the 388th Electronic Combat Squadron and its F-15C/D aircraft redistributed to other F-15 units pursuant to a 2005 BRAC decision. The 726th Air Control Squadron assigned here gives an air picture to the aircraft as they train. This is a mobile radar unit that routinely deploys to various theaters to operate command and control functions. Structured as a Control and Reporting Center, able to accommodate Control and Reporting Post function. Air Weapons Controller personnel often deploy without home-system to support flying units in various scenarios and exercises throughout the U.S. and European theater. An active Air National Guard unit, the 266th Range Squadron, controls and maintains emitter sites within the operational training range located in southern Idaho. Additionally, the 390th Electronic Combat Squadron, located at Naval Air Station Whidbey Island, Washington, is assigned to the 366th Operations Group. The squadron, consisting of USAF flight crews flying U.S. Navy EA-6B Prowler and EA-18G Growler aircraft, is responsible for suppression of enemy air defenses in support of expeditionary aircraft and ground troops by disrupting enemy electronic activity and obtaining tactical electronic intelligence. History : For additional history and lineage, see 366th Operations Group The wing was activated on 1 January 1953 as the 366th Fighter Bomber Wing at Alexandria Air Force Base, Louisiana. It replaced the Federalized Iowa Air National Guard 132d Fighter Bomber Wing which was being returned to state control after a twenty-one-month period of activation as a result of the Korean War. Initially using the former ANG F-51D Mustangs, the 366th received F-86F Sabres which were returned from Korea in the summer of 1953, then received new swept-wing F-84F Thunderstreaks in early 1954. On 18 March 1954, the KB-29 equipped 420th Air Refueling Squadron was attached to the Wing to provide air refueling for the Thunderstreaks. The B-29s were later replaced with KB-50 aerial tankers. The Wing became first TAC unit to perform six-month TDY rotations with NATO at Aviano AB, Italy, with rotations continuing to both Italy and France for six-month stretches. As it did so, the wing also began converting to the F-84F Thunderstreak. The 366th Fighter Day Group was inactivated in September 1957 when parent wing adopted Tri-Deputate organization and assigned operational squadrons directly to the wing. In late 1957, the wing began conversion to the F-100 Super Sabre to its inventory while continuing to operate the F-84. Redesignated 366th Tactical Fighter Wing 1 July 1958 as part of Air Force-Wide naming change. Inactivated 1 April 1959 as part of a general budgetary reduction of USAF wings. Aircraft transferred to Air National Guard. =366th Tactical Fighter Wing= Chaumont- Semoutiers Air Base F-84Fs from the 7108th Tactical Wing in formation over Chaumont ‚Äì 1962. With the end of the Berlin Crisis, these aircraft were reassigned to the 366th Tactical Fighter Wing. On 8 May 1962, the 366th Tactical Fighter Wing was activated at Chaumont-Semoutiers Air Base, France with four Tactical Fighter Squadrons, formed by absorbing the assets and personnel of the provisional 7108th Tactical Wing, formed from the assets of several Air National Guard squadrons rushed to France in the wake of the Berlin Crisis of 1961, then as the ANG personnel were demobilized, personnel were drawn from the active-duty ranks to man the organization. With Wing Headquarters at Chaumont AB, the 366th TFW was organized in France as follows: * 389th Tactical Fighter Squadron (Chaumont AB Blue striping) * 390th Tactical Fighter Squadron (Chambley-Bussieres Air Base Yellow striping) * 391st Tactical Fighter Squadron (Etain-Rouvres Air Base Red striping) * 480th Tactical Fighter Squadron (Phalsbourg-Bourscheid Air Base Green striping) Emblem of the 366th Fighter-Bomber/Tactical Fighter Wing (1953‚Äì1959;1962‚Äì1963) The 480th TFS operated at Chaumont until runway repairs were completed at Phalsbourg Air Base then deployed there on 20 December. This multi-base organizational structure was unique in that it was the only tactical fighter wing in USAFE with four squadrons at four different air bases in Europe. The 366th was also the last USAFE tactical fighter wing formed in Europe. Each squadron flew 20 F-84F Thunderstreaks left by the departing Air National Guard Units. In addition to the flying units being dispersed, the 366th also formed Combat Support Groups at each base to support the flying operations. The decision to form, organize, equip and train the 366th at four different bases was a poor decision by USAFE. The first major problem being the simple logistics needed to operate the squadrons. Deliveries of services in France had always been a problem since the USAF bases were established in the early 1950s. Delivery of supplies and equipment sometimes took months, not weeks. In addition, the F-84 was being phased out of the USAF since 1958 and there was a shortage of pilots and trained mechanics in USAFE for the model. Personnel issues such as married personnel avoiding assignments in France due to poor housing conditions meant that most assigned personnel were first-term airmen with little, or elementary job skills. Also, the cost of maintaining USAFE bases in France were significantly higher. In October 1962 the 366th was needed to respond to the Cuban Missile Crisis, assuming a 24/7 alert posture for two weeks beginning on 23 October. Some deployed aircraft were called back from Wheelus Air Base Libya where they were undergoing training. Targets in Eastern Europe were identified and changed on a daily, sometimes hourly schedule. Two KB-50 tankers were flown into Chaumont to provide aerial refueling to the tactical aircraft if necessary. On 5 November, the 24/7 alert was stood down and operations returned to normal peacetime levels. Unlike their Air National Guard predecessors, HQ USAFE did not provide the 366th with a definitive mission statement. The wing simply continued to build on the 7108th Tactical Wing's missions. These were expanded to include the capability to receive and support dual-based CONUS tactical fighter squadrons. Plans were made for the 366th to absorb up to four additional fighter squadrons and operate from three additional NATO Dispersed Operating Bases. A result of French president Charles de Gaulle's deep suspicion of \\"supranational organizations\\" and France's shift away from the NATO orbit in the early 1960s ultimately led to the decision in November 1962 that Chambley, Chaumont, Etain and Phalsbourg air bases would be returned to reserve status. On 26 April 1963 the 366 TFW was notified of its pending relocation to Holloman AFB, New Mexico. The initial deployment of personnel began on 4 June. Personnel and equipment were either moved to Holloman, or reassigned throughout USAFE. The 366th officially departed Chaumont on 22 July 1963. Holloman Air Force Base The wing returned to the United States in July 1963 and its new home at Holloman AFB, New Mexico. At Holloman, the wing began converting to the new F-4C Phantom II in February 1965. Later that year, the wing sent its first squadron to the Republic of Vietnam. The 390th Fighter Squadron was deployed to Da Nang Air Base (6252d Tactical Wing) in October 1965, and the 391st went to Cam Ranh Bay Air Base (12th Tactical Fighter Wing) in January 1966. In March 1966, HQ 366th Tactical Fighter Wing, the 389th TFS and various support units of the wing entered the conflict and were reassigned to Phan Rang Air Base, Republic of Vietnam as the base host organization. Phan Rang Air Base The 366th arrived at Phan Rang Air Base in March 1966. It was an air base dating back to World War II, used by the Japanese and French. To accommodate the expanding Vietnam War, Phan Rang was expanded by the USAF in 1966 to accommodate both American and South Vietnamese fighter and helicopter units. The 366th was the first permanent USAF organization to be stationed at the base. The wing was composed of a mixture of F-100 Super Sabre and F-4C Phantom II squadrons, deployed from several Tactical Air Command wings: * 352d Tactical Fighter Squadron, F-100D/F, deployed from the 354th TFW (Tail Code: VM) * 389th Tactical Fighter Squadron, F-4C, component of the 366th TFW * 614th Tactical Fighter Squadron, F-100D/F, deployed from the 401st TFW (Tail Code: VP) * 615th Tactical Fighter Squadron, F-100D/F, deployed from the 401st TFW (Tail Code: VZ) Emblem of the 366th Tactical Fighter Wing and subsequent designations, (after 1965) North American F-100F-20-NA Super Sabre Serial 58-1213 of the 352d Fighter Squadron Missions then flown by the 366th TFW consisted generally of two types‚ÄîMiG-CAP patrols to protect strike aircraft from attack by marauding North Vietnamese fighters and fighter-bomber strikes carried out with iron bombs against ground targets. The MiG patrols and attacks in North Vietnam were taken over by the F-4s and F-105s based in Thailand, which could carry a larger bomb load further and faster. In addition, the F-105 was built to take the extreme structural loads of low- level, high-speed flight, whereas the F-100 was not. Consequently, the F-100D fighter bombers generally operated only in South Vietnam where the F-100 turned out to be a very effective ground support aircraft, and beat back many enemy attacks. In October 1966, the F-100-equipped 612th Tactical Fighter Squadron was activated at Phan Rang, composed of former Colorado Air National Guard aircraft which had deployed to Japan and were sent as additional aircraft to Vietnam when their deployment ended. Logistical difficulties in supporting both F-100 and F-4 aircraft at the same base led to the decision to move the 389th TFS to Da Nang Air Base, where F-4Cs were already stationed, and to make Phan Rang an all F-100 base. As former 366th TFW squadrons were at Da Nang (390th, 480th) already, it was decided to perform a name-only reassignment and move the 366th TFW to Da Nang Air Base as the host unit, and reassign the 35th Tactical Fighter Wing at Da Nang to Phan Rang to become the host unit. This realignment was effective on 1 October 1966 in an administrative change, with no personnel reassignments.

The squadrons assigned to the wing at Da Nang were: * 389th Tactical Fighter Squadron (F-4C/D) * 390th Tactical Fighter Squadron (F-4C/D) * 480th Tactical Fighter Squadron (F-4C/D) In addition to the F-4 squadrons, the 64th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron from Clark Air Base, Philippines rotated F-102 Delta Dagger interceptors to the base from Clark, providing air defense of the facility from any North Vietnamese MiGs. The 64th was actually an Air Defense Command unit from Paine Field, Washington which had been deployed to Clark to provide air defense over several major USAF bases in South Vietnam. 366h TFW \\"Gunfighter\\" patch The mission of the 366th at Da Nang was to support Operation Rolling Thunder; the tactical bombing of enemy targets in North Vietnam by destroying any North Vietnamese Aircraft that would attack the F-105 Thunderchief fighter-bombers carrying out tactical bombing missions. On a typical mission over the North, the F-4Cs from the 366th would carry four AIM-7D/E Sparrows, four AIM-9B/D Sidewinders, and a load of eight 750-pound bombs for bombing operations. At first, the bombs were dropped from medium or high-altitudes, but as SAMs became more dangerous, a shift was made to lower altitudes. Unfortunately, this technique also exposed the aircraft to small-arms fire from the ground While at Da Nang, aircrews complained that they were missing many opportunities to shoot down enemy MiGs because the F-4C lacked an internal cannon and its missiles were ineffective at short ranges. So, wing maintainers mounted an external 20-millimeter SUU-16/A Gatling gun pod on the F-4Cs, and in less than a month the wing's aircrews had scored four MiG kills. The gun pod innovation and the MiG kills that followed earned the wing the nickname it carries today, the \\"Gunfighters.\\" During this period, the wing earned a Presidential Unit Citation for shooting down 11 enemy aircraft in a three-month period. By May 1968, the wing had upgraded to the F-4D aircraft. The \\"Stormy\\" FAC effort was begun at Da Nang so that the FACs could be co-located with Wing Intelligence.Schlight, p. 25. Two of the wing's pilots began training for forward air control (FAC) duties on 12 August 1968. Other volunteers followed, as FAC missions into North Vietnam's Route Package 1 began on 2 September. The \\"Stormies\\" flew two sorties per day of armed reconnaissance along North Vietnamese roads. On 24 October 1968, they began night operations against the Ho Chi Minh Trail. During this short-lived effort, there were six near midair collisions during the first eight missions. Seventh Air Force then held the night FAC missions in abeyance until April 1969. When \\"Stormy\\" night ops resumed, it was with use of the Starlight Scope to spot targets, and with support from \\"Blindbat\\" and \\"Candlestick\\" flareships. In May 1969, the \\"Stormy\\" FAC mission requirement was bumped from two to three sorties daily, and their numbers augmented to ten pilots.Rowley, pp. 189‚Äì190. In 1969, two additional squadrons of F-4Es (4th TFS w/ tail code \\"LA\\" & 421st TFS w/ tail code \\"LC\\") joined the wing. After this, the F-4Ds assumed forward air control duties, while the more advanced F-4Es concentrated on aircraft escort duties and conducted ground attack missions. The \\"Stormy\\" FACs were the principal forward air control for the Cambodian Incursion of 1970.Rowley, p. 190. By November 1971, the 366th was the only United States tactical fighter wing still stationed in Vietnam. Between 1966 and 1972, the Gunfighters logged 18 confirmed MiG kills in Vietnam. Upon the wing's return to the United States in October 1972, Captain Lance P. Sijan, a 366th pilot shot down in 1967, was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions as a prisoner of war. Beginning in May 1972, the forces of the USAF were drawn down at Da Nang. On 30 June 1972, the 366th TFW was inactivated at Da Nang Air Base, being reactivated at Takhli Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand the same day. Takhli Royal Thai Air Force Base McDonnell Douglas F-4E Phantom II 67-0297 of the 421st Tactical Fighter Squadron c. 1970 At Takhli, the 366th took over host unit responsibilities from the 49th Tactical Fighter Wing, which had deployed from Holloman Air Force Base in early May 1972 in response to the 1972 North Vietnamese Easter Offensive and invasion of South Vietnam by its regular armed forces. The assignment to Takhli was a name-only reassignment, as the wing consisted of four deployed Holloman F-4D squadrons (7th, 8th, 9th and 417th TFS), and two F-4E squadrons (4th, 421st) which were reassigned from Da Nang after the base in South Vietnam was closed. From Takhli 366th TFW aircrews flew air superiority missions over Vietnam. In addition several AC-130 gunships were deployed to Takhli from the 8th TFW at Ubon. These AC-130s were assigned to Det 1., 16th Special Operations Squadron. The Holloman-based TDY squadrons returned to New Mexico on 27 October 1972. The 4th and 421st TFSs were transferred to the 432d TRW at Udon RTAFB on 31 October 1972. The 366th TFW was inactivated on 31 October 1972, being reactivated the same day without personnel or equipment at Mountain Home Air Force Base, Idaho. Mountain Home Air Force Base General Dynamics F-111A 67-0039. Sent to AMARC 19 June 1998 EF-111 68-0023. Sent to AMARC 13 October 1993 Relieved from combat assignment in Southeast Asia, the 366th was reassigned without personnel or equipment to the United States in October 1972 to replace the 347th Tactical Fighter Wing at Mountain Home AFB, Idaho. At Mountain Home, the wing was assigned the 389th, 390th, and 391st Tactical Fighter Squadrons which had returned from Vietnam, joined the 347th, and began converting to General Dynamics F-111F aircraft. For the first time since it left for Vietnam, the wing once again had its three original flying units. Operations continued unchanged for several years. The wing tested its readiness in August 1976 when a border incident in South Korea prompted the United States to augment its military contingent in South Korea as a show of force. The 366th deployed a squadron of 20 F-111 fighters. They reached Korea only 31 hours after receiving launch notification. Tensions eased shortly afterward and the detachment returned home. In 1977, the Air Force sent the F-111F aircraft from Mountain Home to the 48th Tactical Fighter Wing at RAF Lakenheath, England, in a move to modernize its European forces. In return, the 366th received F-111A aircraft from Nellis AFB, Nevada, where they equipped the 389th and 391st Squadrons. In March 1980, the Air Force announced plans to base EF-111A Raven electronic combat aircraft at Mountain Home. The Raven variant was specifically design to blind enemy radars with powerful electronic signals. The 366th gradually sent part of its F-111A fleet to the Grumman Aerospace Corporation where they underwent extensive modification and were converted to the EF-111A configuration. In support of these changes, on 1 July 1981, Air Force activated the 388th Electronic Combat Squadron to receive the newly modified Ravens. However, a year later, Air Force redesignated the 390th Tactical Fighter Squadron as the 390th Electronic Combat Squadron, which replaced the 388th and began serving as the wing's only EF-111A squadron. Operations throughout the early 1980s remained stable with the 366th Tactical Fighter Wing training F-111A and EF-111A aircrews while maintaining combat readiness in both aircraft. But as the F-111As were being retired, the wing's Ravens saw extensive service. In December 1989, the 366th deployed its EF-111As in support of Operation Just Cause in Panama. The 390th Electronic Combat Squadron contributed a small force of EF-111A aircraft to jam enemy radars during the brief invasion. Likewise, in August 1990, most of the 390th ECS deployed to Saudi Arabia for Operation Desert Shield. The wing also deployed people to many different locations in the Middle East as forces were built up to defend against Iraqi aggression. The largest of the wing's contingents was the 390th ECS at King Fahad AB near Taif, Saudi Arabia. Here, the wing's EF-111A aircraft served with the 48th Tactical Fighter Wing (Provisional) which flew the F-111F. In January 1991 coalition forces began Operation Desert Storm, initiating offensive operations against Iraqi forces. The deployed 390th flew electronic jamming missions during the six-week war, protecting coalition aircraft from Iraqi air defenses and contributing to the Allies' overwhelming control of the air. The deployed Ravens and most of the deployed Gunfighters returned to Mountain Home AFB in late March 1991. =366th Wing= Composite air wing from Mountain Home AFB. F-15s, F-16s, KC-135, B-1B. Photo dated 1998 389th Fighter Squadron Lockheed F-16C Block 52Q Fighting Falcon 93-0551 The aging F-111A fleet was retired in the early 1990s, which prompted the inactivation of the 391st Tactical Fighter Squadron in June 1990 and of the 389th Tactical Fighter Training Squadron in June 1991, their aircraft being sent to the 27th TFW at Cannon AFB, New Mexico, the last USAF active duty F-111 equipped wing. In early 1991, the Air Force announced that the 366th would become the Air Force's premier \\"air intervention\\" composite wing. The wing would grow from a single-squadron of EF-111As to a dynamic, five squadron wing with the ability to deploy rapidly and deliver integrated combat airpower. This resulted from General Merrill A. McPeak, then Chief of Staff of the Air Force (CSAF) and his belief that creating standing composite wings, wherein one commander would control all types of aircraft to defeat an enemy, would streamline and shorten tactical planning. General McPeak expressed that a composite wing would make \\"smaller mistakes because it works and trains together in peacetime...it knows the playbook...in other words, it can exploit the inherent flexibility of airpower.\\" The air intervention composite wing's rapid transition from concept to reality began in October 1991 when redesignated as the 366th Wing. The wing's newly reactivated \\"fighter squadrons\\" became part of the composite wing in March 1992. The 389th Fighter began flying the dual-role F-16C Fighting Falcon, while the 391st Fighter Squadron was equipped with the new F-15E Strike Eagle. These two squadrons provided the Gunfighters round-the-clock precision strike capability. In June 1992, as part of Air Force restructuring, Strategic Air Command and Tactical Air Command merged to form Air Combat Command. A month later, the 366th also gained the 34th Bomb Squadron. Located at Castle AFB, California, the 34th flew the B-52G Stratofortress, giving the composite wing deep interdiction bombing capabilities as the only B-52 unit armed with the deadly, long-range HAVE NAP missile. Next, in September 1992, Air Force redesignated the 390th Electronic Combat Squadron as the 390th Fighter Squadron, which began flying the Air Force's premier air superiority aircraft, the F-15C Eagle. With its internal 20-millimeter cannon and air-to-air missiles, the F-15C provided protection to the wing's high-value assets from enemy air threats. At the same time, Air Force activated the 429th Electronic Combat Squadron, which assumed control of the wing's EF-111A aircraft as they prepared to transfer to Cannon AFB, New Mexico. During this buildup, however, the wing's Ravens remained busy flying combat missions over Iraq, both from Saudi Arabia in support of Operation Desert Calm, and from Incirlik AB, Turkey, in support of Operation Provide Comfort. In June 1993, however, the wing transferred its remaining EF-111As and the 429th ECS to Cannon AFB, ending Mountain Home's long association with the various models of the F-111 aircraft. Not long afterward, in October 1993, the composite wing gained its final flying squadron when the 22nd Air Refueling Squadron was activated and equipped with the KC-135R Stratotankers. These tankers give the wing its ability to deploy globally at a moment's notice. In summation, on 1 January 1994, the 366th Wing consisted of the following squadrons and aircraft: * 22nd Air Refueling Squadron, KC-135R Stratotanker * 34th Bomb Squadron, B-52G Stratofortress (At Castle AFB, California) * 389th Fighter Squadron, F-16C Flying Falcon * 390th Fighter Squadron, F-15C Eagle * 391st Fighter Squadron. F-15E Strike Eagle In another change, on 1 April 1994, the 34th Bomb Squadron transferred its flag to Ellsworth AFB, South Dakota. At the same time the squadron's B-52Gs were retired, making way for the squadron to be equipped with the technologically advanced B-1B Lancer. Next, a gradual transfer of the B-1s from Ellsworth to Mountain Home began in August 1996. The squadron completed a move to Mountain Home on 1 April 1997, when its flag was officially transferred to the Gunfighter home base. Also in 1996, the wing gained yet another operational squadron. On 21 June, the 726th Air Control Squadron was reassigned from Shaw AFB, South Carolina, to Mountain Home. The new squadron brought mobile radar surveillance, and command and control capabilities to the composite wing. In late October 1996, the wing's senior leadership also announced a new name for the 366th Wing. Henceforth, it would be known as the \\"Air Expeditionary Wing\\" while deployed in keeping with an Air Force decision to stand up a \\"battle lab\\" at Mountain Home to refine the new concept. The wing would soon begin working out the most efficient procedures for moving an airpower expeditionary force to pre-selected locations around the world. The Air Expeditionary Force Battlelab (AEFB) activated by paper only on 1 April 1997, stood up at MHAFB on 22 October 1997. While all these changes in the wing's composition were going on, the Gunfighters met numerous operational challenges. They have supported numerous deployments in the United States and around the world from the time of composite wing implementation. Only the highlights of this hectic pace are described here. * Twice, in 1993 and again in 1995, the wing served as the lead unit for Bright Star, a large combined exercise held in Egypt. * In July 1995, the wing also verified its combat capability in the largest operational readiness inspection in Air Force history. The Gunfighters deployed a composite strike force to CFB Cold Lake, Alberta, Canada, and proved they could deliver effective composite airpower. * In 1996, the wing deployed to Incirlik AB, Turkey, in support of Operation Provide Comfort. * The 366th deployed twice to Shaikh Isa AB, Bahrain, to support Operation Southern Watch in 1997 and 1998. These Air Expeditionary Force (AEF) deployments showed that the 366th Wing could employ and sustain its composite force while conducting the mission. Gunfighters returned on a second rotation relieving the unit who had replaced them after the wing's first visit to Bahrain. This historical first set the pace and made way for operational advancements. * The 366th Wing then helped develop the way the Air Force will fly and fight in the next century through its participation as the lead AEF unit during Expeditionary Force Experiment 98. This CSAF experiment combined actual flights and combat simulations to create realistic warfighting environments. It aimed to rapidly mature initiatives that integrated air and space competency while applying decisive air and space power, thus dramatically improving command and control. The wing also participated in Operation Desert Thunder in 1998. The 14 September 1998 announcement by CSAF Michael Ryan that the whole Air Force will reorganize into an 'Expeditionary Aerospace Force' came as no to surprise to Gunfighters. Consequently, the 366th Wing ('Air Expeditionary Wing' (AEW), when deployed) led the way as the model from which other Air Expeditionary Wings were built after 9/11/2001 and the subsequent Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom campaigns as part of the Global War on Terrorism. In early 1999, the wing's three fighter squadrons flew combat missions over southern Iraq, with the 391st dropping more bombs than any other unit since the end of Desert Storm. From April‚ÄìJune 1999, the 22 ARS supported Operation Allied Force, the NATO air campaign against Serbia. During this period, the squadron refueled 600 aircraft and off-loaded over 7 million pounds of fuel. The 726th Air Control Squadron also supported Kosovo operations from May‚ÄìJuly 1999. They were the first American unit to deploy to Romania in 53 years. The team was led by the expertise of the radio maintenance shop. In September 1999, the Gunfighters participated in JEFX 99, the latest in a series of exercises focused on testing emerging command and control technologies for deployed air expeditionary forces. Immediately following JEFX 99, the wing hosted Red Flag 00-1.1, the first red flag exercise in history not conducted at Nellis AFB, Nevada. Flown completely at night, the exercise combined traditional composite strike aircraft packages with low-observable F-117s and B-2 Spirit stealth aircraft in a simulated interdiction campaign. Following the terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001 and the resultant initiation of Operation ENDURING FREEDOM, the 366th Wing once again got the call. While the 34th Bomb Squadron deployed to Diego Garcia as the B-1 component of the 28th Air Expeditionary Wing, the wing sent a Base Operations Support package to Al Udeid AB, Qatar to transform the bare base into a fully operational airfield for large-scale combat operations. In October 2001, the 391st FS deployed to the Arabian Peninsula, while the 389th FS went to Al Udeid in November. Meanwhile, the 22 ARS, 390th FS, and 726th ACS supported Operation Noble Eagle protecting the skies of the Northwestern United States. The TDC Team displayed an exceptional performance at all levels in Support of Noble Eagle. In January 2007, the 391st FS deployed to Bagram Air Base, Afghanistan as the first F-15E Strike Eagle unit to patrol the skies over that country during Operation Enduring Freedom. During the air campaign against Afghanistan that began on 7 October 2001, the 366th Wing's deployed crews flew nearly 1,000 sorties and dropped a total of 7.6 million pounds of bombs against Al Qaeda and Taliban targets‚Äîthe most out of any unit participating in the operation. =366th Fighter Wing= McDonnell Douglas F-15E-49-MC Strike Eagles 90‚Äì235, 90‚Äì243, 90‚Äì253, 90‚Äì236 & 90‚Äì250 of the 391st Fighter Squadron, 366th Fighter Wing in formation. A 3-ship of McDonnell Douglas F-15C Eagles from the 390th Fighter Squadron, 366th Fighter Wing heads out on a Red Flag sortie on 24 July 2009. Following the wing's return from Southwest Asia, consolidation of the Air Force's KC-135 and B-1 force led to the reallocation of the wing's bombers and tankers. While the 22d ARS aircraft transferred to McConnell AFB, Kansas in May 2002, the 34th BS B-1s went to Ellsworth AFB, South Dakota in June. As a result, the 22d ARS inactivated on 30 August 2002, while the 34th transferred to Ellsworth on 18 September. On 30 September, the 366th Wing redesignated to the 366th Fighter Wing in conjunction with a significant change to its organizational structure. Under an Air Force-wide restructuring plan, the 366th Logistics Group redesignated as the 366th Maintenance Group and the 366th Support Group as the 366th Mission Support Group. Now, maintainers formerly assigned to their respective flying squadrons since the objective wing reorganization in 1992, belonged to the newly activated 366th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron under the maintenance group. Also within the maintenance group, the 366th Logistics Support Squadron redesignated as the 366th Maintenance Operations Squadron and the 366th Component Repair Squadron as the 366th Component Maintenance Squadron. On the support side, the 366th Supply Squadron redesignated as the 366th Logistics Readiness Squadron on 18 July 2002, merging both the supply and transportation missions. On the same day, the 366th Transportation Squadron inactivated. Finally, the 366th Contracting Squadron moved from the 366th Logistics Group to the 366th Mission Support Group on 30 September. With these changes, the wing's 10-year mission as the Air Force's premiere air expeditionary wing came to an end, but did not affect its ability to meet any challenge the United States Air Force might face as it moves toward its vision of Global Engagement in the 21st Century. In May 2005, the Base Realignment and Closure commission outlined recommendations to consolidate the 366th Fighter Wing from a multi-frame fighter base to a single frame of F-15E Strike Eagles. The move was part of the Air Force's efforts to consolidate its fighter fleets as a smarter way of doing business and to save money. In November 2006, the 389th FS F-16CJs began to depart to McEntire Air National Guard Base, South Carolina, and Nellis Air Force Base, Nev., while new F-15Es arrived from Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska. The F-16CJs completely departed in March 2007, leaving the base with two F-15E Strike Eagle fighter squadrons and one F-15C Eagle fighter squadron. In September 2010, the F-15C squadron was redesignated as the 390th Electronic Combat Squadron and assumed the mission that the 388th ECS was doing, leaving the base and wing with only two F-15E squadrons. =Lineage= * Established as 366th Fighter-Bomber Wing on 15 November 1952 : Activated on 1 January 1953 : Redesignated 366th Tactical Fighter Wing on 1 July 1958 : Inactivated on 1 April 1959 * Activated on 30 April 1962 : Organized on 8 May 1962 : Redesignated: 366th Wing on 1 October 1991 : Redesignated: 366th Fighter Wing on 30 September 2002. =Assignments= * Ninth Air Force, 1 January 1953 : Attached to Nineteenth Air Force, 15 February 1956 ‚Äì 24 September 1957 * 834th Air Division, 25 September 1957 ‚Äì 1 April 1959 * United States Air Forces in Europe, 30 April 1962 * Seventeenth Air Force, 8 May 1962 * Twelfth Air Force, 12 July 1963 * 832d Air Division, 1 October 1964 * 2d Air Division, 20 March 1966 * Seventh Air Force, 1 April 1966 * Thirteenth Air Force, 27 June 1972 * 832d Air Division, 31 October 1972 * Twelfth Air Force, 1 July 1975‚Äìpresent =Components= Groups * 366th Fighter-Bomber (later, 366th Operations): 1 January 1953 ‚Äì 25 September 1957; 1 March 1992‚Äìpresent * 401st Fighter-Bomber: attached 5 February 1954 ‚Äì 25 September 1957 Squadrons * 4th Tactical Fighter Squadron: 12 April 1969 ‚Äì 31 October 1972 (detached 29‚Äì31 October 1972) * 20th Tactical Air Support Squadron: 15 March ‚Äì 27 June 1972 * 35th Tactical Fighter Squadron: attached 3 April ‚Äì 12 June 1972 * 352d Tactical Fighter Squadron: 15 August ‚Äì 10 October 1966 * 362d Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron: 1 February ‚Äì 27 June 1972 * 388th Tactical Fighter Training (later, 388th Electronic Combat) Squadron: 1 July 1977 ‚Äì 30 September 1979; 1 July 1981 ‚Äì 15 December 1982 * 389th Fighter-Bomber (later, 389th Tactical Fighter; 389th Tactical Fighter Training) Squadron: 25 September 1957 ‚Äì 1 April 1959 (detached 25 September ‚Äì 22 December 1957); 8 May 1962 ‚Äì 15 June 1969 (detached 15 September ‚Äì 16 December 1965); 31 October 1972 ‚Äì 22 July 1991 (detached 16 September ‚Äì 5 October 1976) * 390th Fighter-Bomber (later, 390th Tactical Fighter; 390th Electronic Combat) Squadron: 25 September 1957 ‚Äì 1 April 1959; 8 May 1962 ‚Äì 29 October 1965; 10 October 1966 ‚Äì 30 June 1972; 31 October 1972 ‚Äì 1 October 1982 (detached 19 August ‚Äì 16 September 1976); 15 December 1982 ‚Äì 1 March 1992 * 391st Fighter-Bomber (later, 391st Tactical Fighter) Squadron: 25 September 1957 ‚Äì 1 April 1959; 8 May 1962 ‚Äì 26 January 1966; 31 October 1972 ‚Äì 1 July 1990. * 420 Air Refueling, Fighter-Bomber: attached 18 March 1954 ‚Äì 22 September 1955 * 421st Tactical Fighter Squadron: 16 April 1969 ‚Äì 31 May 1972 (detached 23 April ‚Äì 25 June 1969) * 480th Fighter-Bomber (later, 480th Tactical Fighter) Squadron: 25 September 1957 ‚Äì 1 April 1959; 8 May 1962 ‚Äì 1 February 1966; 10 October 1966 ‚Äì 15 April 1959 * 614th Tactical Fighter Squadron: 18 September ‚Äì 10 October 1966 * 615th Tactical Fighter Squadron: 16 July ‚Äì 10 October 1966 * 622d Air Refueling Squadron: attached 18 July 1955 ‚Äì 1 July 1958. =Stations= * Alexandria AFB (later, England AFB), Louisiana, 1 January 1953 ‚Äì 1 April 1959 * Chaumont- Semoutiers Air Base, France, 8 May 1962 ‚Äì 15 July 1963 * Holloman AFB, New Mexico, 15 July 1963 ‚Äì 11 March 1966 * Phan Rang AB, South Vietnam, 20 March 1966 * Da Nang AB, South Vietnam, 10 October 1966 * Takhli RTAFB, Thailand, 27 June ‚Äì 31 October 1972 * Mountain Home AFB, Idaho, 31 October 1972‚Äìpresent * Sheikh Isa Air Base, Bahrain (???-???) =Aircraft= * F-51 Mustang, 1953 * F-86 Sabre, 1953‚Äì1955, 1956 * F-84 Thunderjet, 1954‚Äì1958 * KB-29 Superfortress, 1954‚Äì1957 * KB-50 Superfortress, 1957‚Äì1958 * F-100 Super Sabre, 1957‚Äì1959 * F-84 Thunderjet, 1962‚Äì1965 * F-100 Super Sabre, 1963, 1966 * F-4 Phantom II, 1965‚Äì1972 * EC-47 Skytrain, 1972 * O-2 Skymaster, 1972 * OV-10 Bronco, 1972 * General Dynamics F-111F, 1972‚Äì1977 * General Dynamics F-111A, 1977‚Äì1991 * EF-111A Raven, 1981‚Äì1993 * F-15A/B Eagle, 1991‚Äì1993 * B-1 Lancer, 1996‚Äì2002 * F-16 Falcon, 1991‚Äì2007 * F-15C & D Eagle, 1992‚Äì2010 * F-15E Strike Eagle, 1992 ‚Äì present See also * List of B-52 Units of the United States Air Force Notes References * Rowley, Ralph A.

Scott Brown and her husband and partner, Robert Venturi, are regarded as among the most influential architects of the twentieth century, both through their architecture and planning, and theoretical writing and teaching. Education and teaching Born to Jewish parents Simon and Phyllis (Hepker) Lakofski, Denise Lakofski had the vision from the time she was five years old that she would be an architect. Pursuing this goal, she spent her summers working with architects, and from 1948 to 1952, after attending Kingsmead College, studied in South Africa at the University of the Witwatersrand. She briefly entered liberal politics, but was frustrated by the lack of acceptance of women in the field. Lakofski traveled to London in 1952, working for the modernist architect Frederick Gibberd. She continued her education there, winning admission to the Architectural Association School of Architecture to learn ‚Äúuseful skills in the building of a just South Africa,‚Äù within an intellectually rich environment which embraced women. She was joined there by Robert Scott Brown, whom she had met at Witwatersrand in 1954, and graduated with a degree in architecture in 1955. Denise Lakofski and Robert Scott Brown were married on July 21, 1955. The couple spent the next three years working and traveling throughout Europe, and in 1958, they moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to study at the University of Pennsylvania's planning department. In 1959, Robert died in a car accident. Denise Scott Brown completed her master's degree in city planning in 1960 and, upon graduation, became a faculty member at the university. While teaching, she completed a master's degree in architecture. At a 1960 faculty meeting, she argued against demolishing the university's library (now the Fisher Fine Arts Library), designed by Philadelphia architect Frank Furness. At the meeting, she met Robert Venturi, a young architect and fellow professor. The two became collaborators and taught courses together from 1962 to 1964. Scott Brown left the University of Pennsylvania in 1965. Becoming known as a scholar in urban planning, she taught at the University of California, Berkeley, and was then named co-chair of the Urban Design Program at the University of California, Los Angeles. During her years in the Southwest, Scott Brown became interested in the newer cities of Los Angeles and Las Vegas. She invited Venturi to visit her classes at UCLA, and in 1966 asked him to visit Las Vegas with her. The two were married in Santa Monica, California, on July 23, 1967. Scott Brown moved back to Philadelphia in 1967 to join Robert Venturi's firm, Venturi and Rauch, and became principal in charge of planning in 1969. Denise Scott Brown later taught at Yale University, where she developed courses that encouraged architects to study problems in the built environment employing both traditional empirical methods of social science but also media studies and pop culture. In 2003 she was a visiting lecturer with Venturi at Harvard University's Graduate School of Design. Architecture and planning Denise Scott Brown in 1978, photographed by Lynn Gilbert In 1972, with Venturi and Steven Izenour, Scott Brown wrote Learning From Las Vegas: the Forgotten Symbolism of Architectural Form. The book published studies of the Las Vegas Strip, undertaken with students in an architectural research studio course which Scott Brown taught with Venturi in 1970 at Yale's School of Architecture and Planning. The book coined the terms \\"Duck\\" and \\"Decorated Shed\\" as applied to opposing architectural styles. Scott Brown has remained a prolific writer on architecture and urban planning. The book joined Venturi's previous Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture (Museum of Modern Art, 1966) as a rebuke to orthodox modernism and elite architectural tastes, and a pointed acceptance of American sprawl and vernacular architecture. Scott Brown and Venturi strove for understanding the city in terms of social, economic and cultural perspectives, viewing it as a set of complex systems upon planning. As part of their design process, the Venturi, Scott Brown & Associates firm studies the trends of an area, marking future expansions or congestions. These studies influence plans and design makeup. Such an approach was used for their Berlin Tomorrow Competition, putting the population movement and daily pattern in consideration. Similarly, the Bryn Mawr College plan took into consideration the landmark of the early campus and the usages of campus space prior to planning. Scott Brown holds a systematic approach to planning in what is coined as ‚ÄúFFF studios.‚Äù In it, form, forces and function determine and help define the urban environment. For example, the Venturi, Scott Brown & Associates firm studied both the expansion of Dartmouth College campus along with the wilderness surrounding the perimeter of the area. The fusion of Eastern and Western ideas in the Nikko hotel chain are evident by merging the Western notion of comfort (62 Stanislaus Von Moos) with historical kimono patterns with their hidden order. The architecture applies a post-Las Vegas modern feel while projecting the traditional Japanese shopping street. Guest rooms are typically made with Western taste, with fabrics, wallpaper, and carpet exclusively from the Venturi, Scott Brown & Associates firm that reflect the scenery outside. In contrast, the exterior ‚Äústreet‚Äù complex reflects Japanese urban and traditional life. With the firm, renamed Venturi, Rauch and Scott Brown in 1980, and finally Venturi, Scott Brown and Associates in 1989, Scott Brown has led major civic planning projects and studies, and more recently has directed many university campus planning projects. By the beginning of the 1980s, Venturi and Brown had made huge success with their ideas and concepts. Critics characterized them as the most influential and visionary architects of the time and continued their path with a clear approach, with their radical theories of design. She has also served as principal-in-charge with Robert Venturi on the firm's larger architectural projects, including the Sainsbury Wing of London's National Gallery, the capitol building in Toulouse and the Nikko Hotel and Spa Resort in Japan. =Pritzker Prize controversy= Scott Brown's husband and business partner Robert Venturi When Robert Venturi was named as winner of the 1991 Pritzker Architecture Prize,Eleanor Blau (April 8, 1991) Robert Venturi Is to Receive Pritzker Architecture Prize The New York Times. Scott Brown did not attend the award ceremony in protest.Robin Pogrebin (April 17, 2013) Partner Without the Prize The New York Times. The prize organization, the Hyatt Foundation stated that, in 1991, it honored only individual architects, a practice that changed in 2001 with the selection of Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron. However, the award was given to two recipients in 1988. In 2013, Women In Design, a student organization spearheaded by Caroline Amory James and Arielle Assouline-Lichten at the Harvard Graduate School of Design started a petition for Scott Brown to receive joint recognition with her partner Robert Venturi. When awarded the Jane Drew Prize in 2017 Scott Brown referred to the Pritzer controversy and subsequent petition saying \\"I was very touched by the Pritzker petition ‚Äì and that is my prize in the end. 20,000 people wrote from all over the world and every one of them called me Denise.\\" = Room at the top = In 1989, Scott Brown published her famous essay, \\"Room at the Top? Sexism and the Star System in Architecture\\". Although Scott Brown wrote the essay in 1975, she decided not to publish it at the time, out of fear for damaging her career. The essay describes her struggle to be recognized as an equal partner of the firm, in an architecture world that was predominantly male. She has since been an advocate for Women in Architecture and has spoken out about discrimination within the profession on several accounts.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Cleveland Indians, Washington Nationals, New York Yankees, and Boston Red Sox. Playing career =College= Traber attended Loyola Marymount University, where he was First-Team All-American and West Coast Conference Player of the Year. He set a single-season school strikeout record with 156 strikeouts (in 123 innings pitched). In , Traber entered the draft and was picked in the first round (16th overall) by the New York Mets. The Mets were prepared to offer Traber a contract worth $1.3 million, but after an MRI showed some damage to his pitching elbow, he signed a contract worth only $400,000. =Professional career= In 2001, the Mets traded Traber to the Cleveland Indians along with Matt Lawton, Alex Escobar, Earl Snyder, and Jerrod Riggan for Roberto Alomar, Mike Bacsik, and Danny Peoples. In , Traber was runner-up minor league pitcher of the year, going 17-5 for the Akron Aeros (Double-A) and Buffalo Bisons (Triple-A), and was voted by Baseball America as having the best control and curveball in the league. His numbers were also good enough to give him top-honors for Cleveland pitching prospects. On April 4, , Traber made his Major League debut. Although he started out well (1.59 ERA, 1-0 record in 7 games that spring) -- even pitching a one-hit shutout of the New York Yankees on July 8‚ÄîTraber's season fell apart when elbow problems that haunted him in college and the minors came back to end his '03 campaign and ultimately the entire season when he needed Tommy John surgery. During the 2004- offseason, the Boston Red Sox signed Traber. Before playing a single game, he was placed on waivers by the Red Sox. On November 10, 2004, he was claimed by the Indians off waivers and was signed to a minor league deal on December 22, 2004. On December 5, , he was released by the Washington Nationals after having pitched for them the previous two seasons. On January 5, , he signed a minor league deal with the New York Yankees and was invited to spring training. On March 15, he was added to the 40-man roster and he opened the season in the Yankee bullpen. He spent much of the season splitting time between the Yankees and their Triple-A affiliate. He was designated for assignment on September 1. In December , he signed a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training to return to the Red Sox. On August 5, , he was called up by the Red Sox to bolster their undermanned bullpen. In October 2009, Traber was granted free agency. He was designated for assignment on August 7, 2009. In June 2010, Traber was signed by the Seattle Mariners. Teaching career Currently teaches physics at his former high school, El Segundo High School.

Though the track's chart performance was modest at best, it would later inspire the funk instrumental, \\"The Grunt\\", recorded by James Brown's backing band at the time, The J.B.'s. Overview =Recording= Following the early 1969 release of \\"It's Your Thing\\", which became a surprise smash hit for them, the Isley Brothers went through a period in 1969 where they went on a stringent recording and touring schedule, recording by day, touring by night, and then recording again after they had finished a show. Between January and December 1969, the brothers would record three consecutive studio albums, a live album, and organize to produce other acts for their T-Neck label, in which inspired by Motown Records and James Brown, they wanted to do things for themselves without the help of label assistance. During this period, Buddah Records agreed to distribute their records for the time being. Though musically different from \\"It's Your Thing\\", the lyrics to \\"Keep On Doin'\\" didn't differ from the song as did several songs they would record for the albums, The Brothers: Isley and Get Into Something. This song was recorded in the summer of 1969 with the group's session musicians that they had hired to play on the recordings. Ernie Isley, who had played drums for the band during live gigs starting at age fourteen and had played bass on \\"It's Your Thing\\", continued to provide bass guitar work on this song. His other brother Marvin and brother-in-law and best friend Chris Jasper was not part of the recording. =Release= The record was the first single to be released off Get Into Something after Buddah Records picked the song for potential sales, passing over the lengthy title track. Possibly due to the song's repetitiveness, the song only got as high as #75 on the Billboard Hot 100, spending four weeks on the chart before dropping, while it landed at #17 on the R&B; singles chart after its release in February 1970. Later that year, James Brown had his band, The J.B.'s, which included original members William \\"Bootsy\\" and his brother Phelps \\"Catfish\\", record an instrumental of \\"Keep On Doin'\\". But instead of titling it as such and possibly to avoid a lawsuit by the Isley Brothers, renamed it \\"The Grunt\\" and added in different arrangements to help the song differ from the Isleys' original including McCullogh screeching on his horn. Little attention was given to the song at the time of its release in the summer of 1970. However, by a full decade later, hip-hop artists began sampling parts of the song, mainly McCullogh's horn parts including the famous screeching intro and the first horn break that occurred in the middle of the song. Also ironically, Brown credited himself and other members of the J.B.'s with writing the song. While Brown and some of the bandmates wrote their own parts, the Isley Brothers' name were left off of credit for \\"The Grunt\\", similar to Marva Whitney's recording of \\"It's My Thing\\", in which was a response song to \\"It's Your Thing\\" and Brown's song \\"My Thang\\" interpolating the melody from the same song.

Set in 1980s Delhi, India, it recounts the coming of age and the sexual adventures and fantasies of a 16-year-old bespectacled schoolgirl, the only child of a Brahmin family. The three simultaneous \\"affairs\\" she has in the course of the novel are all secret, and all with members of her own gender: two with older women and one with a classmate. The title of the book points to the old custom of venerating an elder by referring to them with the suffix -ji added to their name (cf. \\"Gandhiji\\"). In the novel it is the family servant who, though she is older than the daughter of the house, out of deference toward the latter's higher caste addresses her as \\"Babyji\\". (\\"Was I a baby or a Didi? Babyji was such a contradiction in terms, conveying too much respect that the age of a child doesn't warrant.\\") Babyji is the winner of the 2005 Lambda Literary Award for Lesbian Fiction and of the 2006 Stonewall Book Award for Fiction. Plot summary Sixteen-year-old Anamika Sharma is a bright young student aware of her privileged position within Indian society. Head Prefect at her school, she aspires to graduate with excellent grades so as to be able to go on to college in the United States to study physics. Anamika is confident that she will be able to get in, but feels conflicted about contributing to the country's brain drain; ultimately, she concludes that it would be best to return to her native country after the completion of her studies to contribute to the modernization of traditional Indian society and breaking down the rigid caste system. The novel is set against the backdrop of the protests against the recommendations of the Mandal commission, which trigger several acts of self-immolation. In particular, classes are suspended for weeks on end, and Anamika finds more time than usual to pursue her private interests. She spends much of her time with Tripta Adhikari, a free-thinking divorced lady about twice her age whom she calls \\"India\\". India is a wealthy academic who lives in Anamika's neighbourhood, and occasionally Anamika sneaks out of the house when her parents have already gone to bed to spend the night with her new-found friend. Mr and Mrs Sharma know about Tripta Adhikari but naturally assume that the latter has a maternal relationship with their daughter, while India herself knows very well that what she is doing amounts to statutory rape. Anamika's parents even let her go on a short holiday to Kasauli with India and two of her friends. > [...] I noticed that my biting had caused her to start breathing heavily, so > I replaced my teeth with my lips. I gathered different parts of her flesh > between my lips and kissed her all over, in the opposite order in which I > had bitten. In her breathless moans and her cries of pleasure I owned her > more than I owned myself and was immersed in her more than I had ever been > immersed in my own self. Me, I had not yet discovered. I was an unknown > quantity, a constantly unraveling mystery. But India was absolutely and > completely known both carnally and otherwise. I rolled off of her with the > sweet exhaustion of a man who has just hunted his dinner animal. (Chapter > xix) Also in Kasauli, Anamika is horrified to see that she is expected to drink beer--which she does--and that one evening the grown-ups with whom she is travelling not only gather together to smoke a joint but also offer her one as well. In the end Anamika politely refuses. (\\"The love of my parents, my education, every moral lesson I had learned was being challenged.\\") Anamika's second \\"liaison\\" is with Rani, the family's live-in servant. Illiterate, only able to speak Hindi, and regularly beaten up by her alcoholic husband, 23-year-old Rani is rescued from a jhuggi by the Sharmas. However, as their apartment does not have a servant's bedroom, Rani is ordered to sleep on the floor of Anamika's room. This, of course, provides the girl with ample opportunity to explore submissive Rani's perfect body, in spite of the servant's occasional tentative protestations that \\"Babyji\\", for her own good, should seek the love of a boy her own age. Anamika, however, sticks with her choice, rejects male advances, and, despite the danger of being stigmatised as someone who associates with a person from a much lower caste, is even prepared to teach Rani some English. Finally, she makes several passes at Sheela, one of the girls in her class. Although their male classmates' consider Sheela much prettier than Anamika, Sheela herself is quite unaware of her budding beauty and the boyfriends she could have if she wanted to. She does question whether her intimacies with another girl are morally okay but does not recognize the seriousness of Anamika's endeavours. When Anamika asks her if she will be her \\"mistress\\" when they grow up she replies with a non-committal \\"Maybe\\". Only when Anamika goes too far and forces herself on Sheela does the latter reject her, at least for the time being. > \\"Anamika, please stop,\\" she whispered urgently. > If she really didn't want me to she could scream or move away or kick me. > \\"You're beautiful,\\" I said as I slid my hand between her thighs where her > bloomers should have been. She closed her eyes again, but this time I > couldn't tell if she was enjoying it or not. I pushed with my finger. I > wasn't slow, the way I had been with India and Rani. I was afraid if I was > too gentle she would use it to move away. I used all the force I could > muster. > She let out a howl. \\"Stop, it hurts.\\" > I pulled back and said, \\"I just fucked you.\\" There was blood on my finger. > (Chapter xviii) \\"Divorced woman, servant woman, underage woman, I was pursuing them all,\\" Anamika says about herself. Though she likens herself to a playboy, she always makes sure that none of her lovers suspects anything out of the ordinary, that each of them believes she is the only one for her. The presentation of Indian society in Babyji In Babyji, Dawesar paints a Delhi of crime, rape, dirt, blackouts, backwardness, residual colonialism, domestic violence, and arranged marriages, a city where promising young people often see their only option as going to the United States, thus contributing to the brain drain and setting in motion a vicious circle. In contrast to this scenario is Animika herself, a budding intellectual who devours books--among other authors, she has read Dostoevsky, Sartre, Kundera and Bradbury and reads Nabokov's Lolita during her trip to Kasauli--and at school excels at maths and physics. At the same time her moral relativism is of a youthful kind, where every new experience she has is likely to trigger a change in her outlook on the human condition. Her lesbianism is a foil for traditional Indian thought and values. Anamika resists all advances by men, in particular those by her classmate Vidur's father, who, at their first encounter, asks that she call him Adit rather than Uncleji and wants to meet her again, alone. India teaches her that being gay is a \\"Western construct,\\" that sexuality is a continuum rather than a binary phenomenon. Anamika's mind, however, seems already set. She prefers \\"Sheela's smoothness to Vidur's hairiness,\\" sees herself as predator Humbert Humbert and all-too-willing victim rolled into one, and as a grown-up wants to have \\"a big harem full of women\\". She also realizes that feminism in India still has a long way to go in order to catch up with developments in the West. People like Rani have been led to believe that \\"women are not meant to enjoy,\\" and when Adit talks about his wife he calls her a \\"power woman\\" because she works for American Express. The dark side of growing up female in India is further demonstrated in the episode where Anamika and Sheela, having missed the school bus, have to take a crowded public bus to get home from school and fall prey to frotteurs.

It stars Peter as the protagonist, a young transvestite, and features Osamu Ogasawara, Yoshio Tsuchiya and Emiko Azuma. A product of the Japanese New Wave, the film combines elements of arthouse, documentary and experimental cinema, and is thought to have influenced Stanley Kubrick's film adaptation of Anthony Burgess' novel A Clockwork Orange (1971).

In their lone season of 1884, they finished fourth in the UA with a 58-47 record. History The team was managed by Bill Henderson. Their top-hitting regular was left fielder Emmett Seery, who batted .311 with a slugging percentage of .408, and their ace pitcher was Bill Sweeney, who was 40-21 with an earned run average of 2.59, and pitched 538 of the team's 946 innings. The Monumentals were disbanded after the Union Association folded at the end of the 1884 season. Ballpark The Monumentals' home ground was the Belair Lot, which was sometimes known as the Union Association Grounds. On July 4, 1884, Baltimore played a split double header against the Cincinnati Outlaw Reds and the run-away league leaders, the St. Louis Maroons, which saw a sellout crowd in attendance. The field also hosted a home game for the traveling Chicago Browns team. The team did play one game on August 25, 1884 at the larger Madison Avenue Ground, in a win against the Washington Nationals. However, the playing field was deemed unfit to use and they returned to the Belair Lot. Team nickname Baltimore was the first city to erect a monument to George Washington. According to the city's article, \\"Baltimore has more public statues and monuments per capita than any other city in the country.\\" It is assumed that the team's name was a recognition of that fact. Name confusion Retrosheet and Baseball Reference call the UA team the Monumentals.

The Maasai regard the Arusha people as one of their sub-sets and part of the Maasai society. The Arusha people are not to be confused by Arusha residents who are Tanzanian people of different ethnic backgrounds that are born and reside within the borders of the Arusha Region.  Origins  The Arusha people are said to be of Pare origin from the Arusha Chini area of the Kilimanjaro Region. In about 1830 they settled in the Selian area on the southwestern slopes of Mount Meru under Maasai authority. However, the inhabitants reveal migration occurred back and forth throughout the history of this region, and the Arusha people should be viewed as a part of the bigger population inhabiting the entire Kilimanjaro Corridor. The Arusha are distinct from, but related to, the Maasai. They speak the Maasai language, but unlike other Maasai communities, the Arusha people are mostly agriculturalists.http://www.ntz.info/gen/n01826.html#id01171  Late 19th century  During the 1880s a series of disasters forced the Arusha further up Mount Meru. Bovine pleuropneumonia and Rinderpest swept the lands, killing many of the Waarusha livestock and the famines and droughts of 1883-6, 1891-2 and 1897-1900 were especially hard of the people, thus weakening them. During the German occupation of Tanganyika, German colonial administrator Kurt Johannes declared war on the Arusha people (who were resistant to the foreign invasion) in 1895. On October 19, 1896 the Arusha retaliated at attacked Johannes and two German missionaries were killed. In revenge Johannes with the help of the Mangi Rindi of the Chagga kingdom (a former Arusha ally) to the east, Johannes defeated the brave Arusha warriors on October 31, 1886. Johannes then killed many Arusha and Wameru people, confiscated the people's weapons and cattle, burned their home and food reserves to the ground to further weaken them.http://www.ntz.info/gen/n01826.html#id01171 Three years later in 1899 Kurt Johannes wanted to further humiliate and demoralize the Arusha people. He ordered them to build a fort for him, the fort was to be built in the heart of Waarusha territory. The building was completed in 1901 and marked the end of the Waarusha kingdom. The German fort (boma) was built where the clock tower now stands in the heart of the City of Arusha.http://www.ntz.info/gen/b00952.html#id05903 .  20th century  After the defeat and pacification of the Arusha and Meru populations, the Germans confiscated much of the best land from the people and allocated it to a number of German settlers and 100 Afrikaner families from South Africa. During the first world war the British managed to capture Arusha territory in 1916. By 1917 the British expelled the German settlers, confiscating their farms and redistributing them to Greek and British settlers. Under the British controlled Tanganyika territory, through indirect rule the United Waarusha Community was founded and Chief Simeon Laiseri was inaugurated as the new leader of the Waarusha people on January 14, 1948.http://www.ntz.info/gen/n01826.html#id01171 The city of Arusha and the Arusha Region was named after The Waarusha people.

The theatre is attached to an office building called the Warner Building located on 1299 Pennsylvania Avenue. History The Warner Theatre was originally developed by Aaron and Julian Brylawski in 1922. Originally named the Earle Theatre, it was built in 1924 as a movie palace presenting live vaudeville and first run silent movies. It was designed by theatre architect C. Howard Crane of Detroit and Kenneth Franzheim. The Earle Theatre opened December 27, 1924. It had a rooftop garden, basement ballroom, and restaurant. It was said to be \\"just about the last word in theatre construction, a thing of beauty, a valuable addition to the architectural wealth of the nation's capital.\\" In the 1930s, the basement of the theatre had a restaurant called the Neptune Room. This is the Army On August 12, 1943, the movie This Is the Army premiered there. In 1945, the theatre began showing movies exclusively. The Earle featured its own precision dance troupe ‚Äì much like the still-famous Rockettes ‚Äì called the Roxyettes. They would perform before and after films until 1945. They had guest performances by Red Skelton and Jerry Lewis. The theatre was renamed in 1947 in honor of its owner, Harry Warner, one of the founders of Warner Brothers. Harry Warner was said to have commented \\"I own that theatre. Put my name up there!\\" Some of the biggest acts of the 1930s and 1940s came to the theatre, including Bob Hope, Jack Benny, Sophie Tucker, and Duke Ellington. In the 1950s the theatre was redesigned for Cinerama movies. In the 1960s they showed such films as Ben-Hur, Doctor Zhivago, and Hello, Dolly!. By the 1970s, the Warner Theatre had fallen into disrepair and was briefly used to screen pornographic films before being revived as a live concert venue. On June 15, 1978, The Rolling Stones performed a secret show at the theatre. Although the only notice given was on the building's marquee the morning before the show, all seats were quickly sold out. The Warner Theatre closed for renovations in 1989. The Kaempfer Company's $10 million renovations restored the theatre back to its original splendor. The renovations included custom upholstery to match the originals, custom draperies from Portugal, gilt adorning the walls and ceiling, modern production, sound, and lighting equipment, and access to the parking garage. The theatre reopened in October 1992. Frank Sinatra performed for the reopening ceremony. It was his last DC performance before his death in 1998. In 2007, it was the venue for the first annual Library of Congress Gershwin Prize for Popular Song. The recipient of the first Gershwin Prize was Paul Simon. On December 28, 2018, JBG Smith sold the property to CBRE Global Investors for $376.5 million. The theatre is also home to The BET Honors ceremony, held annually. The Warner Theatre has the long running tradition of having The Washington Ballet's performance of The Nutcracker every December. Many other famous acts have played the venue over the years including Liza Minnelli, Shirley MacLaine, David Copperfield, Patti LaBelle, Bob Newhart, Prince, Bob Dylan, Gladys Knight, Kenny Rogers, Eddie Izzard, Tony Bennett, Jon Stewart, Jay-Z, Eddie Vedder, Johnny Cash, Jerry Garcia and John Kahn, David Chappelle, George Carlin, and B.B.

In Tanzania, some of the Bembe people have become a part of Manyema, and Swahili people due to culture and language loss. Originally natives of Kigoma region, the Bembe people of Tanzania have stretched throughout the country from their home land of Kigoma to the island of Zanzibar. Cultural traditions Their social organisation was based on the matrimonial clan, whose members could live in several villages. The family unit generally included three generations. The chief in charge of the village, the nga-bula, mediated with the ancestors. Hunting was the main activity; before leaving on a hunt, the leader would invoke the ancestral spirits, using as intermediaries statuettes kneeling in the position of a hunter waiting for his prey. The Bembe believed in a creator god, Nzambi, whom they did not depict figuratively. He was the master of the life and death ‚Äì unless the latter was due to the act of a sorcerer, ndoki, who could magically ‚Äúeat‚Äù the life force of clan members. The ancestors had close ties with the living and received offerings through the ‚Äúpriest‚Äù who made appeals to statuettes, the kitebi or bimbi, consecrated by the sorcerer. These figurines were the idealized images of the ancestors and would often wear attributes that allowed them to be identified as medicine men or hunters. The ancestor worship among the Bembe is older, though, and precedes the use of magic statues, nkisi, by the sorcerers. The Bembe people of Tanzania have lost their culture for the most part, and the Bembe language is slowly fading. Most of the youth under the age of 30 are unable to speak their mother tongue; instead, they use Swahili as their first language and follow Swahili culture and traditions. A semi-nomadic people, who often settled in forest environments, the Bembe tended to abandon their small villages as the soil became less fertile. The women cultivated the crops and the men hunted and fished. Bembe figures In terms of artistic practice, the Beembe have much in common with other Kongo groups, such as the use of nkisi figures. However, Bembe figures are the most distinctive form of Beembe sculpture. Bermbe are meticulously carved ancestral figures rendered in idealized form. They display extensive geometric incisions representing scarification on their abdomens, and their eyes are inlaid with ceramic or shell shards. Bembe typically have a small cavity between their legs, into which medicinal substances were inserted; this practice endowed the figures with protective powers. The figure usually is upright with knees slightly bent, its large feet with carefully articulated toes standing on the base; the seated position occurs less frequently. Female statuettes have a pronounced, almost square, chin, a large nose and mouth, finely sculpted ears, and hair carved in relief on the forehead. The hands of male sculptures‚Äô are typically turned toward one another and are carrying implements that represent the ancestor's profession in life.

A similar animated simulation by David Garfinkle can be found in . A Belinski‚ÄìKhalatnikov‚ÄìLifshitz (BKL) singularity is a model of the dynamic evolution of the Universe near the initial singularity, described by an anisotropic, chaotic solutions of the Einstein field equations of gravitation. According to this model, the Universe is chaotically oscillating around a gravitational singularity in which time and space become equal to zero. This singularity is physically real in the sense that it is a necessary property of the solution, and will appear also in the exact solution of those equations. The singularity is not artificially created by the assumptions and simplifications made by the other special solutions such as the Friedmann‚ÄìLema√Ætre‚ÄìRobertson‚ÄìWalker, quasi-isotropic, and Kasner solutions. The model is named after its authors Vladimir Belinski, Isaak Khalatnikov, and Evgeny Lifshitz, then working at the Landau Institute for Theoretical Physics. The picture developed by BKL has several important elements. These are: * Near the singularity the evolution of the geometry at different spatial points decouples so that the solutions of the partial differential equations can be approximated by solutions of ordinary differential equations with respect to time for appropriately defined spatial scale factors. This is called the BKL conjecture. * For most types of matter the effect of the matter fields on the dynamics of the geometry becomes negligible near the singularity. Or, in the words of John Wheeler, \\"matter doesn't matter\\" near a singularity. The original BKL work posed a negligible effect for all matter but later they theorized that \\"stiff matter\\" (equation of state p = Œµ) equivalent to a massless scalar field can have a modifying effect on the dynamics near the singularity. * The ordinary differential equations describing the asymptotics come from a class of spatially homogeneous solutions which constitute the Mixmaster dynamics: a complicated oscillatory and chaotic model that exhibits properties similar to those discussed by BKL. The study of the dynamics of the universe in the vicinity of the cosmological singularity has become a rapidly developing field of modern theoretical and mathematical physics. The generalization of the BKL model to the cosmological singularity in multidimensional (Kaluza‚ÄìKlein type) cosmological models has a chaotic character in the spacetimes whose dimensionality is not higher than ten, while in the spacetimes of higher dimensionalities a universe after undergoing a finite number of oscillations enters into monotonic Kasner-type contracting regime. The development of cosmological studies based on superstring models has revealed some new aspects of the dynamics in the vicinity of the singularity. In these models, mechanisms of changing of Kasner epochs are provoked not by the gravitational interactions but by the influence of other fields present. It was proved that the cosmological models based on six main superstring models plus D = 11 supergravity model exhibit the chaotic BKL dynamics towards the singularity. A connection was discovered between oscillatory BKL-like cosmological models and a special subclass of infinite-dimensional Lie algebras ‚Äì the so-called hyperbolic Kac‚ÄìMoody algebras. Introduction The basis of modern cosmology are the special solutions of the Einstein field equations found by Alexander Friedmann in 1922‚Äì1924. The Universe is assumed homogeneous (space has the same metric properties (measures) in all points) and isotropic (space has the same measures in all directions). Friedmann's solutions allow two possible geometries for space: closed model with a ball-like, outwards-bowed space (positive curvature) and open model with a saddle-like, inwards-bowed space (negative curvature). In both models, the Universe is not standing still, it is constantly either expanding (becoming larger) or contracting (shrinking, becoming smaller). This was confirmed by Edwin Hubble who established the Hubble redshift of receding galaxies. The present consensus is that the isotropic model, in general, gives an adequate description of the present state of the Universe; however, isotropy of the present Universe by itself is not a reason to expect that it is adequate for describing the early stages of Universe evolution. At the same time, it is obvious that in the real world homogeneity is, at best, only an approximation. Even if one can speak about a homogeneous distribution of matter density at distances that are large compared to the intergalactic space, this homogeneity vanishes at smaller scales. On the other hand, the homogeneity assumption goes very far in a mathematical aspect: it makes the solution highly symmetric which can impart specific properties that disappear when considering a more general case. Another important property of the isotropic model is the inevitable existence of a time singularity: time flow is not continuous, but stops or reverses after time reaches some very large or very small value. Between singularities, time flows in one direction: away from the singularity (arrow of time). In the open model, there is one time singularity so time is limited at one end but unlimited at the other, while in the closed model there are two singularities that limit time at both ends (the Big Bang and Big Crunch). The only physically interesting properties of spacetimes (such as singularities) are those which are stable, i.e., those properties which still occur when the initial data is perturbed slightly. It is possible for a singularity to be stable and yet be of no physical interest: stability is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for physical relevance. For example, a singularity could be stable only in a neighbourhood of initial data sets corresponding to highly anisotropic universes. Since the actual universe is now apparently almost isotropic such a singularity could not occur in our universe. A sufficient condition for a stable singularity to be of physical interest is the requirement that the singularity be generic (or general). Roughly speaking, a stable singularity is generic if it occurs near every set of initial conditions and the non-gravitational fields are restricted in some specified way to \\"physically realistic\\" fields so that the Einstein equations, various equations of state, etc., are assumed to hold on the evolved spacetimes. It might happen that a singularity is stable under small variations of the true gravitational degrees of freedom, and yet it is not generic because the singularity depends in some way on the coordinate system, or rather on the choice of the initial hypersurface from which the spacetime is evolved. For a system of non-linear differential equations, such as the Einstein equations, a general solution is not unambiguously defined. In principle, there may be multiple general integrals, and each of those may contain only a finite subset of all possible initial conditions. Each of those integrals may contain all required independent functions which, however, may be subject to some conditions (e.g., some inequalities). Existence of a general solution with a singularity, therefore, does not preclude the existence of other additional general solutions that do not contain a singularity. For example, there is no reason to doubt the existence of a general solution without a singularity that describes an isolated body with a relatively small mass. It is impossible to find a general integral for all space and for all time. However, this is not necessary for resolving the problem: it is sufficient to study the solution near the singularity. This would also resolve another aspect of the problem: the characteristics of spacetime metric evolution in the general solution when it reaches the physical singularity, understood as a point where matter density and invariants of the Riemann curvature tensor become infinite. Existence of physical time singularity One of the principal problems studied by the Landau group (to which BKL belong) was whether relativistic cosmological models necessarily contain a time singularity or whether the time singularity is an artifact of the assumptions used to simplify these models. The independence of the singularity on symmetry assumptions would mean that time singularities exist not only in the special, but also in the general solutions of the Einstein equations. It is reasonable to suggest that if a singularity is present in the general solution, there must be some indications that are based only on the most general properties of the Einstein equations, although those indications by themselves might be insufficient for characterizing the singularity. A criterion for generality of solutions is the number of independent space coordinate functions that they contain. These include only the \\"physically independent\\" functions whose number cannot be reduced by any choice of reference frame. In the general solution, the number of such functions must be enough to fully define the initial conditions (distribution and movement of matter, distribution of gravitational field) at some moment of time chosen as initial. This number is four for an empty (vacuum) space, and eight for a matter and/or radiation-filled space. Previous work by the Landau group; reviewed in) led to the conclusion that the general solution does not contain a physical singularity. This search for a broader class of solutions with a singularity has been done, essentially, by a trial- and-error method, since a systematic approach to the study of the Einstein equations was lacking. A negative result, obtained in this way, is not convincing by itself; a solution with the necessary degree of generality would invalidate it, and at the same time would confirm any positive results related to the specific solution. At that time, the only known indication for the existence of physical singularity in the general solution was related to the form of the Einstein equations written in a synchronous frame, that is, in a frame in which the proper time x0 = t is synchronized throughout the whole space; in this frame the space distance element dl is separate from the time interval dt.The convention used by BKL is the same as in the book. The Latin indices run through the values 0, 1, 2, 3; Greek indices run through the space values 1, 2, 3. The metric gik has the signature (+ ‚àí ‚àí ‚àí); Œ≥Œ±Œ≤ = ‚àígŒ±Œ≤ is the 3-dimensional space metric tensor. BKL use a system of units, in which the speed of light and the Einstein gravitational constant are equal to 1. The Einstein equation written in synchronous frame gives a result in which the metric determinant g inevitably becomes zero in a finite time irrespective of any assumptions about matter distribution. However, the efforts to find a general physical singularity were foregone after it became clear that the singularity mentioned above is linked with a specific geometric property of the synchronous frame: the crossing of time line coordinates. This crossing takes place on some encircling hypersurfaces which are four-dimensional analogs of the caustic surfaces in geometrical optics; g becomes zero exactly at this crossing. Therefore, although this singularity is general, it is fictitious, and not a physical one; it disappears when the reference frame is changed. This, apparently, dissuaded the researchers for further investigations along these lines. Several years passed before the interest in this problem waxed again when published his theorems that linked the existence of a singularity of unknown character with some very general assumptions that did not have anything in common with a choice of reference frame. Other similar theorems were found later on by Hawking and Geroch (see Penrose‚ÄìHawking singularity theorems). This revived interest in the search for singular solutions. Generalized homogeneous solution In a space that is both homogeneous and isotropic the metric is determined completely, leaving free only the sign of the curvature. Assuming only space homogeneity with no additional symmetry such as isotropy leaves considerably more freedom in choosing the metric. The following pertains to the space part of the metric at a given instant of time t assuming a synchronous frame so that t is the same synchronised time for the whole space. =The BKL conjecture= In their 1970 work, BKL stated that as one approaches a singularity, terms containing time derivatives in Einstein's equations dominate over those containing spatial derivatives. This has since been known as the BKL conjecture and implies that Einstein's partial differential equations (PDE) are well approximated by ordinary differential equations (ODEs), whence the dynamics of general relativity effectively become local and oscillatory. The time evolution of fields at each spatial point is well approximated by the homogeneous cosmologies in the Bianchi classification. By separating the time and space derivatives in the Einstein equations, for example, in the way used above for the classification of homogeneous spaces, and then setting the terms containing space derivatives equal to zero, one can define the so-called truncated theory of the system (truncated equations). Then, the BKL conjecture can be made more specific: Weak conjecture: As the singularity is approached the terms containing space derivatives in the Einstein equations are negligible in comparison to the terms containing time derivatives. Thus, as the singularity is approached the Einstein equations approach those found by setting derivative terms to zero. Thus, the weak conjecture says that the Einstein equations can be well approximated by the truncated equations in the vicinity of the singularity. Note that this does not imply that the solutions of the full equations of motion will approach the solutions to the truncated equations as the singularity is approached. This additional condition is captured in the strong version as follows. Strong conjecture: As the singularity is approached the Einstein equations approach those of the truncated theory and in addition the solutions to the full equations are well approximated by solutions to the truncated equations. In the beginning, the BKL conjecture seemed to be coordinate-dependent and rather implausible. Barrow and Tipler, for example, among the ten criticisms of BKL studies, include the inappropriate (according to them) choice of synchronous frame as a means to separate time and space derivatives. The BKL conjecture was sometimes rephrased in the literature as a statement that near the singularity only the time derivatives are important. Such a statement, taken at face value, is wrong or at best misleading since, as shown in the BKL analysis itself, space- like gradients of the metric tensor cannot be neglected for generic solutions of pure Einstein gravity in four spacetime dimensions, and in fact play a crucial role in the appearance of the oscillatory regime. However, there exist reformulations of Einstein theory in terms of new variables involving the relevant gradients, for example in Ashtekar-like variables, for which the statement about the dominant role of the time derivatives is correct. It is true that one gets at each spatial point an effective description of the singularity in terms of a finite dimensional dynamical system described by ordinary differential equations with respect to time, but the spatial gradients do enter these equations non-trivially. Subsequent analysis by a large number of authors has shown that the BKL conjecture can be made precise and by now there is an impressive body of numerical and analytical evidence in its support. It is fair to say that we are still quite far from a proof of the strong conjecture. But there has been outstanding progress in simpler models. In particular, Berger, Garfinkle, Moncrief, Isenberg, Weaver, and others showed that, in a class of models, as the singularity is approached the solutions to the full Einstein field equations approach the \\"velocity term dominated\\" (truncated) ones obtained by neglecting spatial derivatives. Andersson and Rendall showed that for gravity coupled to a massless scalar field or a stiff fluid, for every solution to the truncated equations there exists a solution to the full field equations that converges to the truncated solution as the singularity is approached, even in the absence of symmetries. These results were generalized to also include p-form gauge fields. In these truncated models the dynamics are simpler, allowing a precise statement of the conjecture that could be proven. In the general case, the strongest evidence to date comes from numerical evolutions. Berger and Moncrief began a program to analyze generic cosmological singularities. While the initial work focused on symmetry reduced cases, more recently Garfinkle performed numerical evolution of space-times with no symmetries in which, again, the mixmaster behavior is apparent. Finally, additional support for the conjecture has come from a numerical study of the behavior of test fields near the singularity of a Schwarzschild black hole. =Kasner solution= spherical coordinates towards singularity. The Lifshitz-Khalatnikov parameter is u=2 (1/u=0.5) and the r coordinate is 2pŒ±(1/u)œÑ where œÑ is logarithmic time: œÑ = ln t.The expression for r is derived by logarithming the power coefficients in the metric: ln [t2pŒ±(1/u)] = 2pŒ±(1/u) ln t. Shrinking along the axes is linear and anisotropic (no chaoticity). The BKL approach to anisotropic (as opposed to isotropic) homogeneous spaces starts with a generalization of an exact particular solution derived by Kasner for a field in vacuum, in which the space is homogeneous and has a Euclidean metric that depends on time according to the Kasner metric (dl is the line element; dx, dy, dz are infinitesimal displacements in the three spatial dimensions, and t is time period passed since some initial moment t0 = 0). Here, p1, p2, p3 are any three numbers that satisfy the following Kasner conditions Because of these relations, only one of the three numbers is independent (two equations with three unknowns). All three numbers are never the same; two numbers are the same only in the sets of values (-\\\\frac {1}{3},\\\\frac{2}{3},\\\\frac {2}{3}) and (0, 0, 1).When (p1, p2, p3) = (0, 0, 1) the spacetime metric with dl2 from transforms to Galilean metric with the substitution t sh z = Œ∂, t ch z = œÑ, that is, the singularity is fictional and the spacetime is flat. In all other cases the numbers are different, one number is negative and the other two are positive. This is partially proved by squaring both sides of the first condition and developing the square: :\\\\left ( p_1 + p_2 + p_3 \\\\right )^2 = \\\\left ( p_1^2 + p_2^2 + p_3^2 \\\\right ) + \\\\left ( 2 p_1 p_2 + 2 p_2 p_3 + 2 p_1 p_3 \\\\right ) = 1 The term \\\\left ( p_1^2 + p_2^2 + p_3^2 \\\\right ) is equal to 1 by dint of the second condition and therefore the term with the mixed products should be zero. This is possible if at least one of the p1, p2, p3 is negative. If the numbers are arranged in increasing order, p1 < p2 < p3, they change in the intervals (Fig. 4) monotonously increasing while p2(u) is a monotonously decreasing function of u. The Kasner metric corresponds to a flat homogenous but anisotropic space in which all volumes increase with time in such a way that the linear distances along two axes y and z increase while the distance along the axis x decreases. The moment t = 0 causes a singularity in the solution; the singularity in the metric at t = 0 cannot be avoided by any reference frame transformation. At the singularity, the invariants of the four-dimensional curvature tensor go to infinity. An exception is the case p1 = —Ä2 = 0, —Ä3 = 1; these values correspond to a flat spacetime: the transformation t sh z = Œ∂, t ch z = œÑ turns the metric into Galilean. BKL parametrize the numbers p1, p2, p3 in terms of a single independent (real) parameter u (Lifshitz-Khalatnikov parameter) as follows The Kasner index parametrization appears mysterious until one thinks about the two constraints on the indices . Both constraints fix the overall scale of the indices so that only their ratios can vary. It is natural to pick one of those ratios as a new parameter, which can be done in six different ways. Picking u = u32 = p3 / p2, for example, it is trivial to express all six possible ratios in terms of it. Eliminating p3 = up2 first, and then using the linear constraint to eliminate p1 = 1 ‚àí p2 ‚àí up2 = 1 ‚àí (1 + u)p2, the quadratic constraint reduces to a quadratic equation in p2 with roots p2 = 0 (obvious) and p2 = (1 + u) / (1 + u + u2), from which p1 and p3 are then obtained by back substitution. One can define six such parameters uab = pa / pb, for which pc ‚â§ pb ‚â§ pa when (c, b, a) is a cyclic permutation of (1, 2, 3). All different values of p1, p2, p3 ordered as above are obtained with u running in the range u ‚â• 1. The values u < 1 are brought into this range according to In the generalized solution, the form corresponding to applies only to the asymptotic metric (the metric close to the singularity t = 0), respectively, to the major terms of its series expansion by powers of t. In the synchronous reference frame it is written in the form of with a space distance element where The three-dimensional vectors l, m, n define the directions at which space distance changes with time by the power laws . These vectors, as well as the numbers pl, pm, pn which, as before, are related by , are functions of the space coordinates. The powers pl, pm, pn are not arranged in increasing order, reserving the symbols p1, p2, p3 for the numbers in that remain arranged in increasing order. The determinant of the metric of is where v = l[mn]. It is convenient to introduce the following quantities Here and below all symbols for vector operations (vector products, the operations rot, grad, etc.) should be understood in a very formal way as operations over the covariant components of the vectors l, m, n such that are performed in Cartesian coordinates x1, x2, x3. {v},\\\\ \\\\mu=\\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{m}\\\\ \\\\mathrm{curl}\\\\ \\\\mathbf{m}}{v},\\\\ u=\\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{n}\\\\ \\\\mathrm{curl}\\\\ \\\\mathbf{n}}{v}.}} The space metric in is anisotropic because the powers of t in cannot have the same values. On approaching the singularity at t = 0, the linear distances in each space element decrease in two directions and increase in the third direction. The volume of the element decreases in proportion to t. The Kasner metric is introduced in the Einstein equations by substituting the respective metric tensor Œ≥Œ±Œ≤ from without defining a priori the dependence of a, b, c from t: :\\\\varkappa_{\\\\alpha}^{\\\\beta}=\\\\frac{2 \\\\dot a}{a}l_{\\\\alpha}l^{\\\\beta}+\\\\frac{2 \\\\dot b}{b}m_{\\\\alpha}m^{\\\\beta}+\\\\frac{2 \\\\dot c}{c}n_{\\\\alpha}n^{\\\\beta} where the dot above a symbol designates differentiation with respect to time. The Einstein equation takes the form All its terms are to a second order for the large (at t ‚Üí 0) quantity 1/t. In the Einstein equations , terms of such order appear only from terms that are time-differentiated. If the components of PŒ±Œ≤ do not include terms of order higher than two, then {abc}=0,\\\\ -R_m^m=\\\\frac{(a \\\\dot b c)\\\\dot{ }}{abc}=0,\\\\ -R_n^n=\\\\frac{(a b \\\\dot c)\\\\dot{ }}{abc}=0}} where indices l, m, n designate tensor components in the directions l, m, n. These equations together with give the expressions with powers that satisfy . However, the presence of one negative power among the 3 powers pl, pm, pn results in appearance of terms from PŒ±Œ≤ with an order greater than t‚àí2. If the negative power is pl (pl = p1 < 0), then PŒ±Œ≤ contains the coordinate function Œª and become {abc}+\\\\frac{\\\\lambda^2 a^2}{2b^2 c^2}=0, -R_m^m & =\\\\frac{(a \\\\dot b c)\\\\dot{ }}{abc}-\\\\frac{\\\\lambda^2 a^2}{2b^2 c^2}=0, -R_n^n & =\\\\frac{(a b \\\\dot c)\\\\dot{ }}{abc}-\\\\frac{\\\\lambda^2 a^2}{2b^2 c^2}=0. \\\\end{align}}} Here, the second terms are of order t‚àí2(pm \\\\+ pn ‚àí pl) whereby pm \\\\+ pn ‚àí pl = 1 + 2 pl > 1.Excepting the case (p1, p2, p3) = (0, 0, 1), in which the metric singularity is fictitious. To remove these terms and restore the metric , it is necessary to impose on the coordinate functions the condition Œª = 0. The remaining three Einstein equations contain only first order time derivatives of the metric tensor. They give three time-independent relations that must be imposed as necessary conditions on the coordinate functions in . This, together with the condition Œª = 0, makes four conditions. These conditions bind ten different coordinate functions: three components of each of the vectors l, m, n, and one function in the powers of t (any one of the functions pl, pm, pn, which are bound by the conditions ). When calculating the number of physically arbitrary functions, it must be taken into account that the synchronous system used here allows time-independent arbitrary transformations of the three space coordinates. Therefore, the final solution contains overall 10 ‚àí 4 ‚àí 3 = 3 physically arbitrary functions which is one less than what is needed for the general solution in vacuum. The degree of generality reached at this point is not lessened by introducing matter; matter is written into the metric and contributes four new coordinate functions necessary to describe the initial distribution of its density and the three components of its velocity. This makes possible to determine matter evolution merely from the laws of its movement in an a priori given gravitational field which are the hydrodynamic equations \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x^i} \\\\left (\\\\sqrt{-g}\\\\sigma u^i \\\\right ) = 0,}} {\\\\partial x^i} \\\\right \\\\rbrace =-\\\\frac{\\\\partial p}{\\\\partial x^i}-u_i u^k \\\\frac{\\\\partial p}{\\\\partial x^k},}} where ui is the 4-dimensional velocity, Œµ and œÉ are the densities of energy and entropy of matter (cf. and; also; for details see ). For the ultrarelativistic equation of state p = Œµ/3 the entropy œÉ ~ Œµ1/4. The major terms in and are those that contain time derivatives. From and the space components of one has :\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t} \\\\left (\\\\sqrt{-g} u_0 \\\\varepsilon^{\\\\frac{3}{4}} \\\\right ) = 0,\\\\ 4 \\\\varepsilon \\\\cdot \\\\frac{\\\\partial u_{\\\\alpha}}{\\\\partial t}+u_{\\\\alpha} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\varepsilon}{\\\\partial t} = 0, resulting in = \\\\mathrm{const},\\\\ u_{\\\\alpha} \\\\varepsilon^{\\\\frac{1}{4}}= \\\\mathrm{const},}} where 'const' are time- independent quantities. Additionally, from the identity uiui = 1 one has (because all covariant components of uŒ± are to the same order) :u_0^2 \\\\approx u_n u^n = \\\\frac{u_n^2}{c^2}, where un is the velocity component along the direction of n that is connected with the highest (positive) power of t (supposing that pn = p3). From the above relations, it follows that or .}} The above equations can be used to confirm that the components of the matter stress-energy-momentum tensor standing in the right hand side of the equations :R_0^0 = T_0^0 - \\\\frac{1}{2}T,\\\\ R_{\\\\alpha}^{\\\\beta} = T_{\\\\alpha}^{\\\\beta}- \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\delta_{\\\\alpha}^{\\\\beta}T, are, indeed, to a lower order by 1/t than the major terms in their left hand sides. In the equations R_{\\\\alpha}^0 = T_{\\\\alpha}^0 the presence of matter results only in the change of relations imposed on their constituent coordinate functions. The fact that Œµ becomes infinite by the law confirms that in the solution to one deals with a physical singularity at any values of the powers p1, p2, p3 excepting only (0, 0, 1). For these last values, the singularity is non-physical and can be removed by a change of reference frame. The fictional singularity corresponding to the powers (0, 0, 1) arises as a result of time line coordinates crossing over some 2-dimensional \\"focal surface\\". As pointed out in, a synchronous reference frame can always be chosen in such a way that this inevitable time line crossing occurs exactly on such surface (instead of a 3-dimensional caustic surface). Therefore, a solution with such simultaneous for the whole space fictional singularity must exist with a full set of arbitrary functions needed for the general solution. Close to the point t = 0 it allows a regular expansion by whole powers of t. For an analysis of this case, see. Oscillating mode towards the singularity The general solution by definition is completely stable; otherwise the Universe would not exist. Any perturbation is equivalent to a change in the initial conditions in some moment of time; since the general solution allows arbitrary initial conditions, the perturbation is not able to change its character. Looked at such angle, the four conditions imposed on the coordinate functions in the solution are of different types: three conditions that arise from the equations R_{\\\\alpha}^0= 0 are \\"natural\\"; they are a consequence of the structure of Einstein equations. However, the additional condition Œª = 0 that causes the loss of one derivative function, is of entirely different type: instability caused by perturbations can break this condition. The action of such perturbation must bring the model to another, more general, mode. The perturbation cannot be considered as small: a transition to a new mode exceeds the range of very small perturbations. The analysis of the behavior of the model under perturbative action, performed by BKL, delineates a complex oscillatory mode on approaching the singularity. They could not give all details of this mode in the broad frame of the general case. However, BKL explained the most important properties and character of the solution on specific models that allow far-reaching analytical study. These models are based on a homogeneous space metric of a particular type. Supposing a homogeneity of space without any additional symmetry leaves a great freedom in choosing the metric. All possible homogeneous (but anisotropic) spaces are classified, according to Bianchi, in several Bianchi types (Type I to IX). (see also Generalized homogeneous solution) BKL investigate only spaces of Bianchi Types VIII and IX. If the metric has the form of , for each type of homogeneous spaces exists some functional relation between the reference vectors l, m, n and the space coordinates. The specific form of this relation is not important. The important fact is that for Type VIII and IX spaces, the quantities Œª, Œº, ŒΩ are constants while all \\"mixed\\" products l rot m, l rot n, m rot l, etc.. are zeros. For Type IX spaces, the quantities Œª, Œº, ŒΩ have the same sign and one can write Œª = Œº = ŒΩ = 1 (the simultaneous sign change of the 3 constants does not change anything). For Type VIII spaces, 2 constants have a sign that is opposite to the sign of the third constant; one can write, for example, Œª = ‚àí 1, Œº = ŒΩ = 1.The constants Œª, Œº, ŒΩ are the so-called structural constants of the space movement group. The study of the effect of the perturbation on the \\"Kasner mode\\" is thus confined to a study on the effect of the Œª-containing terms in the Einstein equations. Type VIII and IX spaces are the most suitable models for such a study. Since all 3 quantities Œª, Œº, ŒΩ in those Bianchi types differ from zero, the condition Œª = 0 does not hold irrespective of which direction l, m, n has negative power law time dependence. The Einstein equations for the Type VIII and Type IX space models are {abc}+\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left (a^2b^2c^2\\\\right )\\\\left [\\\\lambda^2 a^4-\\\\left (\\\\mu b^2- u c^2\\\\right )^2\\\\right ]=0, -R_m^m & =\\\\frac{(a \\\\dot{b} c)\\\\dot{ }}{abc}+\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left(a^2b^2c^2\\\\right )\\\\left [\\\\mu^2 b^4-\\\\left(\\\\lambda a^2- u c^2\\\\right)^2\\\\right]=0, -R_n^n & =\\\\frac{\\\\left(a b \\\\dot c\\\\right)\\\\dot{ }}{abc}+\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left(a^2b^2c^2\\\\right)\\\\left[ u^2 c^4-\\\\left(\\\\lambda a^2-\\\\mu b^2\\\\right)^2\\\\right]=0, \\\\end{align}}} (the remaining components R_l^0, R_m^0, R_n^0, R_l^m, R_l^n, R_m^n are identically zeros). These equations contain only functions of time; this is a condition that has to be fulfilled in all homogeneous spaces. Here, the and are exact and their validity does not depend on how near one is to the singularity at t = 0.In their exact form, the Einstein equations for homogeneous space contain, in general, 6 different functions of time Œ≥ab(t) in the metric. The fact that in the present case a consistent system of exact equations is obtained for the metric which contains only 3 functions of time (Œ≥11 = –∞2, Œ≥22 = b2, Œ≥33 = c2) is related to a symmetry that leads to the disappearance of 6 Ricci tensor components. The time derivatives in and take a simpler form if –∞, b, —Å are substituted by their logarithms Œ±, Œ≤, Œ≥: substituting the variable t for œÑ according to: Then (subscripts denote differentiation by œÑ): Adding together equations and substituting in the left hand side the sum (Œ± + Œ≤ + Œ≥)œÑ œÑ according to , one obtains an equation containing only first derivatives which is the first integral of the system : This equation plays the role of a binding condition imposed on the initial state of . The Kasner mode is a solution of when ignoring all terms in the right hand sides. But such situation cannot go on (at t ‚Üí 0) indefinitely because among those terms there are always some that grow. Thus, if the negative power is in the function a(t) (pl = p1) then the perturbation of the Kasner mode will arise by the terms Œª2a4; the rest of the terms will decrease with decreasing t. If only the growing terms are left in the right hand sides of , one obtains the system: (compare ; below it is substituted Œª2 = 1). The solution of these equations must describe the metric evolution from the initial state, in which it is described by with a given set of powers (with pl < 0); let pl = —Ä1, pm = —Ä2, pn = —Ä3 so that Then where Œõ is constant. Initial conditions for are redefined as Equations are easily integrated; the solution that satisfies the condition is where b0 and c0 are two more constants. It can easily be seen that the asymptotic of functions at t ‚Üí 0 is . The asymptotic expressions of these functions and the function t(œÑ) at œÑ ‚Üí ‚àí‚àû isThe asymptotic values of Œ±œÑ, Œ≤œÑ, Œ≥œÑ at œÑ ‚Üí ‚àí‚àû can be found without fully solving . It suffices to note that the first of these equations has a form of a \\"particle\\" moving in one dimension in the field of an exponential potential wall with Œ± playing the role of a constant. In this analogy, the Kasner mode refers to a free movement with constant velocity Œ±œÑ = Œõp1. After reflection from the wall, the particle moves freely with velocity Œ±œÑ = ‚àíŒõp1. Also noting that from Œ±œÑ \\\\+ Œ≤œÑ = const, and Œ±œÑ \\\\+ Œ≥œÑ = const, one can see that Œ≤œÑ and Œ≥œÑ take the values Œ≤œÑ = Œõ(p2 ‚àí 2p1), Œ≥œÑ = Œõ(p3 ‚àí 2p1). :a \\\\sim e^{-\\\\Lambda p_1\\\\tau},\\\\ b \\\\sim e^{\\\\Lambda(p_2+2p_1)\\\\tau},\\\\ c \\\\sim e^{\\\\Lambda(p_3+2p_1)\\\\tau},\\\\ t \\\\sim e^{\\\\Lambda(1+2p_1)\\\\tau}. Expressing a, b, c as functions of t, one has where Then The above shows that perturbation acts in such a way that it changes one Kasner mode with another Kasner mode, and in this process the negative power of t flips from direction l to direction m: if before it was pl < 0, now it is p'm < 0\\\\. During this change the function a(t) passes through a maximum and b(t) passes through a minimum; b, which before was decreasing, now increases: a from increasing becomes decreasing; and the decreasing c(t) decreases further. The perturbation itself (Œª2a4Œ± in ), which before was increasing, now begins to decrease and die away. Further evolution similarly causes an increase in the perturbation from the terms with Œº2 (instead of Œª2) in , next change of the Kasner mode, and so on. It is convenient to write the power substitution rule with the help of the parametrization : The greater of the two positive powers remains positive. BKL call this flip of negative power between directions a Kasner epoch. The key to understanding the character of metric evolution on approaching singularity is exactly this process of Kasner epoch alternation with flipping of powers pl, pm, pn by the rule . The successive alternations with flipping of the negative power p1 between directions l and m (Kasner epochs) continues by depletion of the whole part of the initial u until the moment at which u < 1\\\\. The value u < 1 transforms into u > 1 according to ; in this moment the negative power is pl or pm while pn becomes the lesser of two positive numbers (pn = p2). The next series of Kasner epochs then flips the negative power between directions n and l or between n and m. At an arbitrary (irrational) initial value of u this process of alternation continues unlimited.Introduction of non-diagonal components of Œ≥ab(t) imparts some new features to the BKL model: rotations of axes corresponding to the Kasner epoch powers; this problem is studied in In the exact solution of the Einstein equations, the powers pl, pm, pn lose their original, precise, sense. This circumstance introduces some \\"fuzziness\\" in the determination of these numbers (and together with them, to the parameter u) which, although small, makes meaningless the analysis of any definite (for example, rational) values of u. Therefore, only these laws that concern arbitrary irrational values of u have any particular meaning. The larger periods in which the scales of space distances along two axes oscillate while distances along the third axis decrease monotonously, are called eras; volumes decrease by a law close to ~ t. On transition from one era to the next, the direction in which distances decrease monotonously, flips from one axis to another. The order of these transitions acquires the asymptotic character of a random process. The same random order is also characteristic for the alternation of the lengths of successive eras (by era length, BKL understand the number of Kasner epoch that an era contains, and not a time interval). To each era (s-th era) correspond a series of values of the parameter u starting from the greatest, u_{\\\\max}^{(s)}, and through the values u_{\\\\max}^{(s)} ‚àí 1, u_{\\\\max}^{(s)} ‚àí 2, ..., reaching to the smallest, u_{\\\\min}^{(s)} < 1\\\\. Then that is, k(s) = [u_{\\\\max}^{(s)}] where the brackets mean the whole part of the value. The number k(s) is the era length, measured by the number of Kasner epochs that the era contains. For the next era ,\\\\ k^{(s+1)}=\\\\left[\\\\frac{1}{x^{(s)}}\\\\right].}} In the limitless series of numbers u, composed by these rules, there are infinitesimally small (but never zero) values x(s) and correspondingly infinitely large lengths k(s). The era series become denser on approaching t = 0. However, the natural variable for describing the time course of this evolution is not the world time t, but its logarithm, ln t, by which the whole process of reaching the singularity is extended to ‚àí‚àû. According to , one of the functions a, b, c, that passes through a maximum during a transition between Kasner epochs, at the peak of its maximum is where it is supposed that amax is large compared to b0 and c0; in u is the value of the parameter in the Kasner epoch before transition. It can be seen from here that the peaks of consecutive maxima during each era are gradually lowered. Indeed, in the next Kasner epoch this parameter has the value u' = u ‚àí 1, and Œõ is substituted according to with Œõ' = Œõ(1 ‚àí 2p1(u)). Therefore, the ratio of 2 consecutive maxima is :\\\\frac{a'_\\\\max}{a_\\\\max}=\\\\left[\\\\frac{p_1(u-1)}{p_1(u)}\\\\left(1-2p_1(u)\\\\right)\\\\right]^{\\\\frac{1}{2}}; and finally \\\\equiv \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{u'}{u}}.}} The above are solutions to Einstein equations in vacuum. As for the pure Kasner mode, matter does not change the qualitative properties of this solution and can be written into it disregarding its reaction on the field. However, if one does this for the model under discussion, understood as an exact solution of the Einstein equations, the resulting picture of matter evolution would not have a general character and would be specific for the high symmetry imminent to the present model. Mathematically, this specificity is related to the fact that for the homogeneous space geometry discussed here, the Ricci tensor components R_\\\\alpha^0 are identically zeros and therefore the Einstein equations would not allow movement of matter (which gives non-zero stress energy-momentum tensor components T_\\\\alpha^0). In other words, the synchronous frame must also be co-moving with respect to matter. If one substitutes in uŒ± = 0, u0 = 1, it becomes Œµ ~ (abc)‚àí4/3 ~ t‚àí4/3. This difficulty is avoided if one includes in the model only the major terms of the limiting (at t ‚Üí 0) metric and writes into it a matter with arbitrary initial distribution of densities and velocities. Then the course of evolution of matter is determined by its general laws of movement and that result in . During each Kasner epoch, density increases by the law where p3 is, as above, the greatest of the numbers p1, p2, p3. Matter density increases monotonously during all evolution towards the singularity. Metric evolution Very large u values correspond to Kasner powers which are close to the values (0, 0, 1). Two values that are close to zero, are also close to each other, and therefore the changes in two out of the three types of \\"perturbations\\" (the terms with Œª, Œº and ŒΩ in the right hand sides of ) are also very similar. If in the beginning of such long era these terms are very close in absolute values in the moment of transition between two Kasner epochs (or made artificially such by assigning initial conditions) then they will remain close during the greatest part of the length of the whole era. In this case (BKL call this the case of small oscillations), analysis based on the action of one type of perturbations becomes incorrect; one must take into account the simultaneous effect of two perturbation types. =Two perturbations= Consider a long era, during which two of the functions a, b, c (let them be a and b) undergo small oscillations while the third function (c) decreases monotonously. The latter function quickly becomes small; consider the solution just in the region where one can ignore c in comparison to a and b. The calculations are first done for the Type IX space model by substituting accordingly Œª = Œº = ŒΩ = 1. After ignoring function c, the first 2 equations give and can be used as a third equation, which takes the form The solution of is written in the form :\\\\alpha+\\\\beta=\\\\frac{2a_0^2}{\\\\xi_0}\\\\left(\\\\tau-\\\\tau_0\\\\right)+2\\\\ln a_0, where Œ±0, Œæ0 are positive constants, and œÑ0 is the upper limit of the era for the variable œÑ. It is convenient to introduce further a new variable (instead of œÑ) Then Equations and are transformed by introducing the variable œá = Œ± ‚àí Œ≤: Decrease of œÑ from œÑ0 to ‚àí‚àû corresponds to a decrease of Œæ from Œæ0 to 0. The long era with close a and b (that is, with small œá), considered here, is obtained if Œæ0 is a very large quantity. Indeed, at large Œæ the solution of in the first approximation by 1/Œæ is \\\\sin \\\\left(\\\\xi-\\\\xi_0\\\\right),}} where A is constant; the multiplier \\\\tfrac{1}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\xi}} makes œá a small quantity so it can be substituted in by sh 2œá ‚âà 2œá.The constant in the sine argument, of course, is not necessarily the same as Œæ0 in and ; however, making them the same does not change in any way the solution character. From one obtains :\\\\gamma_\\\\xi=\\\\frac{1}{4}\\\\xi\\\\left(2\\\\chi_\\\\xi^2+\\\\chi^2\\\\right)=A^2,\\\\ \\\\gamma=A^2\\\\left(\\\\xi-\\\\xi_0\\\\right)+\\\\mathrm{const}. After determining Œ± and Œ≤ from and and expanding eŒ± and eŒ≤ in series according to the above approximation, one obtains finally:In a more precise calculation, a slowly changing logarithmic term appears in the sine argument, and a multiplier appears in front the exponent in the expression for —Å(Œæ), see . \\\\left[1\\\\pm \\\\frac{A}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\xi}}\\\\sin \\\\left(\\\\xi-\\\\xi_0\\\\right)\\\\right],}} The relation between the variable Œæ and time t is obtained by integration of the definition dt = abc dœÑ which gives The constant c0 (the value of —Å at Œæ = Œæ0) should be now c0 \\\\ll Œ±0¬∑ Figure 5. Bianchi type VIII (open) space undergoing a chaotic BKL (Mixmaster) dynamics close to singularity according to rules with initial u = \\\\sqrt{13}. The singularity is at the central pinch of the hyperboloid surface. Let us now consider the domain Œæ \\\\ll 1\\\\. Here the major terms in the solution of are: :\\\\chi=\\\\alpha-\\\\beta=k\\\\ln \\\\xi+\\\\mathrm{const},\\\\, where k is a constant in the range ‚àí 1 < k < 1; this condition ensures that the last term in is small (sh 2œá contains Œæ2k and Œæ‚àí2k). Then, after determining Œ±, Œ≤, and t, one obtains ,\\\\ b \\\\sim \\\\xi^{\\\\frac{1-k}{2}},\\\\ c \\\\sim \\\\xi^{-\\\\frac{1-k^2}{4}},\\\\ t \\\\sim \\\\xi^{\\\\frac{3+k^2}{4}}.}} This is again a Kasner mode with the negative t power present in the function c(t).If in , one substitutes sh 2œá with 2œá and solves it for all values of Œæ, one obtains œá = c1J0(Œæ) + c2N0(Œæ) where J0, N0 are Bessel functions of the I and II kind. This solution interpolates between the two limiting cases and allows to relate by an order of magnitude the constant parameters in and . These results picture an evolution that is qualitatively similar to that, described above. During a long period of time that corresponds to a large decreasing Œæ value, the two functions a and b oscillate, remaining close in magnitude \\\\tfrac{a-b}{a} \\\\sim \\\\tfrac{1}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\xi}}; in the same time, both functions a and b slowly (\\\\sim \\\\sqrt{\\\\xi}) decrease. The period of oscillations is constant by the variable Œæ : ŒîŒæ = 2œÄ (or, which is the same, with a constant period by logarithmic time: Œî ln t = 2œÄŒë2). The third function, c, decreases monotonously by a law close to c = c0t/t0. This evolution continues until Œæ ‚âà1 and formulas and are no longer applicable. Its time duration corresponds to change of t from t0 to the value t1, related to Œæ0 according to The relationship between Œæ and t during this time can be presented in the form {\\\\ln \\\\tfrac{t_0}{t_1}}.}} After that, as seen from , the decreasing function c starts to increase while functions a and b start to decrease. This Kasner epoch continues until terms c2/a2b2 in become ~ t2 and a next series of oscillations begins. The law for density change during the long era under discussion is obtained by substitution of in : When Œæ changes from Œæ0 to Œæ ‚âà1, the density increases \\\\xi^2_0 times. It must be stressed that although the function c(t) changes by a law, close to c ~ t, the metric does not correspond to a Kasner metric with powers (0, 0, 1). The latter corresponds to an exact solution found by Taub which is allowed by eqs. ‚Äì and in which where p, Œ¥1, Œ¥2 are constant. In the asymptotic region œÑ ‚Üí ‚àí‚àû, one can obtain from here a = b = const, c = const.t after the substitution –µ—ÄœÑ = t. In this metric, the singularity at t = 0 is non-physical. Let us now describe the analogous study of the Type VIII model, substituting in eqs. ‚Äì Œª = ‚àí1, Œº = ŒΩ = 1. If during the long era, the monotonically decreasing function is a, nothing changes in the foregoing analysis: ignoring a2 on the right side of equations and , goes back to the same equations and (with altered notation). Some changes occur, however, if the monotonically decreasing function is b or c; let it be c. As before, one has equation with the same symbols, and, therefore, the former expressions for the functions a(Œæ) and b(Œæ), but equation is replaced by The major term at large Œæ now becomes :\\\\gamma_{\\\\xi} \\\\approx \\\\frac{1}{8}\\\\xi \\\\cdot 2, \\\\quad \\\\gamma \\\\approx \\\\frac{1}{8} \\\\left (\\\\xi^2-\\\\xi_0^2 \\\\right ), so that The value of c as a function of time t is again c = c0t/t0 but the time dependence of Œæ changes. The length of a long era depends on Œæ0 according to .}} On the other hand, the value Œæ0 determines the number of oscillations of the functions a and b during an era (equal to Œæ0/2œÄ). Given the length of an era in logarithmic time (i.e., with given ratio t0/t1) the number of oscillations for Type VIII will be, generally speaking, less than for Type IX. For the period of oscillations one gets now Œî ln t = œÄŒæ/2; contrary to Type IX, the period is not constant throughout the long era, and slowly decreases along with Œæ. =The small-time domain= Long eras violate the \\"regular\\" course of evolution which makes it difficult to study the evolution of time intervals spanning several eras. It can be shown, however, that such \\"abnormal\\" cases appear in the spontaneous evolution of the model to a singular point in the asymptotically small times t at sufficiently large distances from a start point with arbitrary initial conditions. Even in long eras both oscillatory functions during transitions between Kasner epochs remain so different that the transition occurs under the influence of only one perturbation. All results in this section relate equally to models of the types VIII and IX. During each Kasner epoch abc = Œõt, i. e. Œ± + Œ≤ + Œ≥ = ln Œõ + ln t. On changing over from one epoch (with a given value of the parameter u) to the next epoch the constant Œõ is multiplied by 1 + 2p1 = (1 ‚Äì u + u2)/(1 + u + u2) < 1\\\\. Thus a systematic decrease in Œõ takes place. But it is essential that the mean (with respect to the lengths k of eras) value of the entire variation of ln Œõ during an era is finite. Actually the divergence of the mean value could be due only to a too rapid increase of this variation with increasing k. For large value of the parameter u, ln(1 + 2p1) ‚âà ‚àí2/u. For a large k the maximal value u(max) = k + x ‚âà k. Hence the entire variation of ln Œõ during an era is given by a sum of the form \\\\sum \\\\ln \\\\left ( 1 + 2p_1 \\\\right ) = \\\\dots + \\\\frac{1}{k-2} + \\\\frac{1}{k-1} + \\\\frac{1}{k} with only the terms that correspond to large values of u written down. When k increases this sum increases as ln k. But the probability for an appearance of an era of a large length k decreases as 1/k2 according to ; hence the mean value of the sum above is finite. Consequently, the systematic variation of the quantity ln Œõ over a large number of eras will be proportional to this number. But it is seen in that with t ‚Üí 0 the number s increases merely as ln ln t. Thus in the asymptotic limit of arbitrarily small t the term ln Œõ can indeed be neglected as compared to ln t. In this approximation Since a, b, c have the dimension of length, their logarithms are defined only up to an additive constant which depends on the choice of the length units; in this sense has a conditional meaning corresponding to a certain choice of the zero value of Œ±, Œ≤, Œ≥. where Œ© denotes the \\"logarithmic time\\" and the process of epoch transitions can be regarded as a series of brief time flashes. The magnitudes of maxima of the oscillating scale functions are also subject to a systematic variation. From for u ‚â´ 1 it follows that a_{\\\\max}^\\\\prime - a_{\\\\max} \\\\approx -1/2 u . In the same way as it was done above for the quantity ln Œõ, one can hence deduce that the mean decrease in the height of the maxima during an era is finite and the total decrease over a large number of eras increases with t ‚Üí 0 merely as ln Œ©. At the same time the lowering of the minima, and by the same token the increase of the amplitude of the oscillations, proceed () proportional to Œ©. In correspondence with the adopted approximation the lowering of the maxima is neglected in comparison with the increase of the amplitudes so Œ±max = 0, Œ≤max = 0, Œ≥max = 0 for the maximal values of all oscillating functions and the quantities Œ±, Œ≤, Œ≥ run only through negative values that are connected with one another at each instant of time by the relation . Figure 4. Variation of Œ±, Œ≤, and Œ≥ as functions of the logarithmic time Œ© during one era. The vertical dash lines denote alterations of the Kasner epochs, corresponding to the linear segments of the curves. On the top are indicated the values of the parameter u that determine the Kasner exponents. The last epoch has a longer duration if x is small. In the first epoch of the next era, Œ≥ begins to increase and Œ± becomes a monotonically decreasing function. Considering such instant change of epochs, the transition periods are ignored as small in comparison to the epoch length; this condition is actually fulfilled.According to , transitions are large with small p1 (i. e. large u) and are ‚âà1/p1 ~ u. But even in this case Œîn ~ un Œ±n \\\\gg un Replacement of Œ±, Œ≤, and Œ≥ maxima with zeros requires that quantities ln (p1Œõ) be small in comparison with the amplitudes of oscillations of the respective functions. As mentioned above, during transitions between eras p1 values can become very small while their magnitude and probability for occurrence are not related to the oscillation amplitudes in the respective moment. Therefore, in principle, it is possible to reach so small p1 values that the above condition (zero maxima) is violated. Such drastic drop of Œ±max can lead to various special situations in which the transition between Kasner epochs by the rule becomes incorrect (including the situations described above). These \\"dangerous\\" situations could break the laws used for the statistical analysis below. As mentioned, however, the probability for such deviations converges asymptotically to zero; this issue will be discussed below. Consider an era that contains k Kasner epochs with a parameter u running through the values and let Œ± and Œ≤ are the oscillating functions during this era (Fig. 4).Fixing the limits of the era according to eq. is meaningful because in such case the era contains all epochs in which the third function, Œ≥(t) decreases monotonously. If the era is defined by the sequence of u values from k + x to 1 + x, then the monotonous decrease of Œ≥(t) will continue during the first epoch of the next era. Initial moments of Kasner epochs with parameters un are Œ©n. In each initial moment, one of the values Œ± or Œ≤ is zero, while the other has a minimum. Values Œ± or Œ≤ in consecutive minima, that is, in moments Œ©n are (not distinguishing minima Œ± and Œ≤). Values Œ¥n that measure those minima in respective Œ©n units can run between 0 and 1. Function Œ≥ monotonously decreases during this era; according to its value in moment Œ©n is During the epoch starting at moment Œ©n and ending at moment Œ©n+1 one of the functions Œ± or Œ≤ increases from ‚àíŒ¥nŒ©n to zero while the other decreases from 0 to ‚àíŒ¥n+1Œ©n+1 by linear laws, respectively: :\\\\mathrm{const} + p_1(u_n)\\\\Omega \\\\, and \\\\mathrm{const} - p_2(u_n)\\\\Omega \\\\, resulting in the recurrence relation and for the logarithmic epoch length where, for short, f(u) = 1 + u + u2. The sum of n epoch lengths is obtained by the formula \\\\right ] \\\\delta_0\\\\Omega_0. }} It can be seen from that Œ±n+1 > Œ±n, i.e., the oscillation amplitudes of functions Œ± and Œ≤ increase during the whole era although the factors Œ¥n may be small. If the minimum at the beginning of an era is deep, the next minima will not become shallower; in other words, the residue Œ± ‚Äî Œ≤ at the moment of transition between Kasner epochs remains large. This assertion does not depend upon era length k because transitions between epochs are determined by the common rule also for long eras. The last oscillation amplitude of functions Œ± or Œ≤ in a given era is related to the amplitude of the first oscillation by the relationship Œ±k‚àí1 = Œ±0 (k + x) / (1 + x). Even at k 's as small as several units x can be ignored in comparison to k so that the increase of Œ± and Œ≤ oscillation amplitudes becomes proportional to the era length. For functions a = eŒ± and b = eŒ≤ this means that if the amplitude of their oscillations in the beginning of an era was A0, at the end of this era the amplitude will become A_0^{k/(1+x)}. The length of Kasner epochs (in logarithmic time) also increases inside a given era; it is easy to calculate from that Œîn+1 > Œîn.Epoch lengths are great in comparison to transitions between epochs. According to transition lengths are great at small p1 (i.e. large u) and are ‚àù 1/p1 ‚àù u. But even in this case Œîn ‚àù unŒ±n \\\\gg un. The total era length is (the term with 1/x arises from the last, k-th, epoch whose length is great at small x; cf. Fig. 2). Moment Œ©n when the k-th epoch of a given era ends is at the same time moment Œ©'0 of the beginning of the next era. In the first Kasner epoch of the new era function Œ≥ is the first to rise from the minimal value Œ≥k = ‚àí Œ©k (1 ‚àí Œ¥k) that it reached in the previous era; this value plays the role of a starting amplitude Œ¥'0Œ©'0 for the new series of oscillations. It is easily obtained that: It is obvious that Œ¥'0Œ©'0 > Œ¥0Œ©0. Even at not very great k the amplitude increase is very significant: function c = eŒ≥ begins to oscillate from amplitude A_0 ' \\\\sim A_0^{k^2}. The issue about the above mentioned \\"dangerous\\" cases of drastic lowering of the upper oscillation limit is left aside for now. According to the increase in matter density during the first (k ‚àí 1) epochs is given by the formula :\\\\ln \\\\left ( \\\\frac{\\\\varepsilon_{n+1}}{\\\\varepsilon_n} \\\\right ) = 2 \\\\left [ 1 - p_3 ( u_n ) \\\\right ] \\\\Delta_{n+1}. For the last k epoch of a given era, at u = x < 1 the greatest power is p2(x) (not p3(x) ). Therefore, for the density increase over the whole era one obtains Therefore, even at not very great k values, \\\\varepsilon_0' / \\\\varepsilon_0 \\\\sim A_0^{2k}. During the next era (with a length k ' ) density will increase faster because of the increased starting amplitude A0': \\\\varepsilon_0 / \\\\varepsilon_0' \\\\sim A_0'^{2k} \\\\sim A_0^{2k^2 k'}, etc. These formulae illustrate the steep increase in matter density. =Statistical analysis near the singularity= The sequence of era lengths k(s), measured by the number of Kasner epochs contained in them, acquires asymptotically the character of a random process. The same pertains also to the sequence of the interchanges of the pairs of oscillating functions on going over from one era to the next (it depends on whether the numbers k(s) are even or odd). A source of this stochasticity is the rule ‚Äì according to which the transition from one era to the next is determined in an infinite numerical sequence of u values. This rule states, in other words, that if the entire infinite sequence begins with a certain initial value u_\\\\max^{(0)} = k^{(0)} + x^{(0)}, then the lengths of the eras k(0), k(1), ..., are the numbers in the continued fraction expansion .}} This expansion corresponds to the mapping transformation of the interval [0, 1] onto itself by the formula Tx = {1/x}, i.e., xs+1 = {1/xs}. This transformation belongs to the so-called expanding transformations of the interval [0, 1], i.e., transformations x ‚Üí f(x) with f‚Ä≤(x) > 1. Such transformations possess the property of exponential instability: if we take initially two close points their mutual distance increases exponentially under the iterations of the transformations. It is well known that the exponential instability leads to the appearance of strong stochastic properties. It is possible to change over to a probabilistic description of such a sequence by considering not a definite initial value x(0) but the values x(0) = x distributed in the interval from 0 to 1 in accordance with a certain probabilistic distributional law w0(x). Then the values of x(s) terminating each era will also have distributions that follow certain laws ws(x). Let ws(x)dx be the probability that the s-th era terminates with the value u_\\\\max^{(s)} = x lying in a specified interval dx. The value x(s) = x, which terminates the s-th era, can result from initial (for this era) values u_\\\\max^{(s)} = x + k, where k = 1, 2, ...; these values of u_\\\\max^{(s)} correspond to the values x(s‚Äì1) = 1/(k + x) for the preceding era. Noting this, one can write the following recurrence relation, which expresses the distribution of the probabilities ws(x) in terms of the distribution ws‚Äì1(x): w_{s}(x)dx = \\\\sum_{k=1}^\\\\infty w_{s-1} \\\\left (\\\\frac{1}{k+x} \\\\right ) \\\\left\\\\vert d \\\\frac{1}{k+x} \\\\right\\\\vert or w_{s-1} \\\\left ( \\\\frac{1}{k+x} \\\\right ) .}} If the distribution ws(x) tends with increasing s to a stationary (independent of s) limiting distribution w(x), then the latter should satisfy an equation obtained from by dropping the indices of the functions ws‚àí1(x) and ws(x). This equation has a solution (normalized to unity and taken to the first order of x). was known already to Gauss, and an equation of type was considered in this connection by Rodion Kuzmin (see Gauss‚ÄìKuzmin distribution). Further information on the chaotic behaviour and entropy of continued fractions in Linas Vepstas. 2008. Entropy of Continued Fractions (Gauss-Kuzmin Entropy) In order for the s-th era to have a length k, the preceding era must terminate with a number x in the interval between 1/(k + 1) and 1/k. Therefore, the probability that the era will have a length k is equal to (in the stationary limit) At large values of k In relating the statistical properties of the cosmological model with the ergodic properties of the transformation xs+1 = {1/xs} an important point must be mentioned. In an infinite sequence of numbers x constructed in accordance with this rule, arbitrarily small (but never vanishing) values of x will be observed corresponding to arbitrarily large lengths k. Such cases can (by no means necessarily!) give rise to certain specific situations when the notion of eras, as of sequences of Kasner epochs interchanging each other according to the rule , loses its meaning (although the oscillatory mode of evolution of the model still persists). Such an \\"anomalous\\" situation can be manifested, for instance, in the necessity to retain in the right-hand side of terms not only with one of the functions a, b, c (say, a4), as is the case in the \\"regular\\" interchange of the Kasner epochs, but simultaneously with two of them (say, a4, b4, a2b2). On emerging from an \\"anomalous\\" series of oscillations a succession of regular eras is restored. Statistical analysis of the behavior of the model which is entirely based on regular iterations of the transformations is corroborated by an important theorem: the probability of the appearance of anomalous cases tends asymptotically to zero as the number of iterations s ‚Üí ‚àû (i.e., the time t ‚Üí 0) which is proved at the end of this section. The validity of this assertion is largely due to a very rapid rate of increase of the oscillation amplitudes during every era and especially in transition from one era to the next one. The process of the relaxation of the cosmological model to the \\"stationary\\" statistical regime (with t ‚Üí 0 starting from a given \\"initial instant\\") is less interesting, however, than the properties of this regime itself with due account taken for the concrete laws of the variation of the physical characteristics of the model during the successive eras. An idea of the rate at which the stationary distribution sets in is obtained from the following example. Let the initial values x(0) be distributed in a narrow interval of width Œ¥x(0) about some definite number. From the recurrence relation (or directly from the expansion ) it is easy to conclude that the widths of the distributions ws(x) (about other definite numbers) will then be equal to (this expression is valid only so long as it defines quantities Œ¥x(s) ‚â™ 1). The mean value \\\\bar k, calculated from this distribution, diverges logarithmically. For a sequence, cut off at a very large, but still finite number N, one has \\\\bar k \\\\sim \\\\ln N. The usefulness of the mean in this case is very limited because of its instability: because of the slow decrease of W(k), fluctuations in k diverge faster than its mean. A more adequate characteristic of this sequence is the probability that a randomly chosen number from it belongs to an era of length K where K is large. This probability is lnK / lnN. It is small if 1 \\\\ll K \\\\ll N. In this respect one can say that a randomly chosen number from the given sequence belongs to the long era with a high probability. It convenient to average expressions that depend simultaneously on k(s) and x(s). Since both these quantities are derived from the same quantity x(s‚Äì1) (which terminates the preceding era), in accordance with the formula k(s) \\\\+ x(s) = 1/x(s‚Äì1), their statistical distributions cannot be regarded as independent. The joint distribution Ws(k,x)dx of both quantities can be obtained from the distribution ws‚Äì1(x)dx by making in the latter the substitution x ‚Üí 1/(x + k). In other words, the function Ws(k,x) is given by the very expression under the summation sign in the right side of . In the stationary limit, taking w from , one obtains Summation of this distribution over k brings us back to , and integration with respect to dx to . The recurrent formulas defining transitions between eras are re-written with index s numbering the successive eras (not the Kasner epochs in a given era!), beginning from some era (s = 0) defined as initial. Œ©(s) and Œµ(s) are, respectively, the initial moment and initial matter density in the s-th era; Œ¥(s)Œ©(s) is the initial oscillation amplitude of that pair of functions Œ±, Œ≤, Œ≥, which oscillates in the given era: k(s) is the length of s-th era, and x(s) determines the length (number of Kasner epochs) of the next era according to k(s+1) = [1/x(s)]. According to ‚Äì \\\\right ) \\\\equiv \\\\exp \\\\xi^{(s)},}} {1 + \\\\delta^{(s)} k^{(s)} \\\\left ( 1 + x^{(s)} + 1 / x^{(s)} \\\\right )},}} {\\\\varepsilon^{(s)}} \\\\right ) = 2 \\\\left ( k^{(s)} + x^{(s)} - 1 \\\\right ) \\\\delta^{(s)} \\\\Omega^{(s)} }} (Œæ(s) is introduced in to be used further on). The quantities Œ¥(s) have a stable stationary statistical distribution P(Œ¥) and a stable (small relative fluctuations) mean value. For their determination BKL used (with due reservations) an approximate method based on the assumption of statistical independence of the random quantity Œ¥(s) and of the random quantities k(s), x(s). For the function P(Œ¥) an integral equation was set up which expressed the fact that the quantities Œ¥(s+1) and Œ¥(s) interconnected by the relation have the same distribution; this equation was solved numerically. In a later work, Khalatnikov et al. showed that the distribution P(Œ¥) can actually be found exactly by an analytical method. For the statistical properties in the stationary limit, it is reasonable to introduce the so-called natural extension of the transformation Tx = {1/x} by continuing it without limit to negative indices. Otherwise stated, this is a transition from a one-sided infinite sequence of the numbers (x0, x1, x2, ...), connected by the equalities Tx = {1/x}, to a \\"doubly infinite\\" sequence X = (..., x‚àí1, x0, x1, x2, ...) of the numbers which are connected by the same equalities for all ‚Äì‚àû < s < ‚àû. Of course, such expansion is not unique in the literal meaning of the word (since xs‚Äì1 is not determined uniquely by xs), but all statistical properties of the extended sequence are uniform over its entire length, i.e., are invariant with respect to arbitrary shift (and x0 loses its meaning of an \\"initial\\" condition). The sequence X is equivalent to a sequence of integers K = (..., k‚àí1, k0, k1, k2, ...), constructed by the rule ks = [1/xs‚Äì1]. Inversely, every number of X is determined by the integers of K as an infinite continued fraction \\\\equiv x_{s+1}^{+}}} (the convenience of introducing the notation x_{s+1}^{+} with an index shifted by 1 will become clear in the following). For concise notation the continuous fraction is denoted simply by enumeration (in square brackets) of its denominators; then the definition of x_{s}^{+} can be written as Reverse quantities are defined by a continued fraction with a retrograde (in the direction of diminishing indices) sequence of denominators The recurrence relation is transformed by introducing temporarily the notation Œ∑s = (1 ‚àí Œ¥s)/Œ¥s. Then can be rewritten as \\\\eta_{s+1} = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\eta_{s} x_{s-1} + k_{s}} By iteration an infinite continuous fraction is obtained \\\\eta_{s+1} x_s = \\\\left [ k_{s}, k_{s-1}, \\\\dots \\\\right ] = x_{s+1}^{-} Hence \\\\eta_{s} = x_{s}^{-} / x_{s}^{+} and finally {x_{s}^{+} + x_{s}^{-}}}} This expression for Œ¥s contains only two (instead of the three in ) random quantities x_{s}^{+} and x_{s}^{-}, each of which assumes values in the interval [0, 1]. It follows from the definition that 1/x_{s}^{-} = x_{s}^{-} + k_{s} = x_{s}^{-} + \\\\left [ 1 / x_{s}^{+} \\\\right ]. Hence the shift of the entire sequence X by one step to the right means a joint transformation of the quantities x_{s}^{+} and x_{s}^{-} according to , \\\\quad x_{s+1}^{-} = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\frac{1}{x_{s}^{+}} + x_{s}^{-}}}} This is a one-to-one mapping in the unit square. Thus we have now a one-to-one transformation of two quantities instead of a not one-to-one transformation Tx = {1/x} of one quantity. The quantities x_{s}^{+} and x_{s}^{-} have a joint stationary distribution P(x+, x‚àí). Since is a one-to-one transformation, the condition for the distribution to be stationary is expressed simply by a function equation where J is the Jacobian of the transformation. A shift of the sequence X by one step gives rise to the following transformation T of the unit square: x^{\\\\prime} = \\\\frac{1}{x}, \\\\quad y^{\\\\prime} = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\frac{1}{x} + y} (with x \\\\equiv x_0^{+}, y \\\\equiv x_0^{-}, cf. ). The density P(x, y) defines the invariant measure for this transformation. It is natural to suppose that P(x, y) is a symmetric function of x and y. This means that the measure is invariant with respect to the transformation S(x, y) = (y, x) and hence with respect to the product ST with ST(x, y) = (x‚Ä≥, y‚Ä≥) and x = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\frac{1}{x} + y}, \\\\quad y = \\\\frac{1}{x} Evidently ST has a first integral H = 1/x + y. On the line H = const ‚â° c the transformation has the form \\\\frac{1}{x} = \\\\left [ \\\\frac{1}{x} \\\\right ] + y = \\\\left [ \\\\frac{1}{x} \\\\right ] + c - \\\\frac{1}{x} = c - \\\\left \\\\\\\\{ \\\\frac{1}{x} \\\\right \\\\\\\\} Hence the invariant measure density of ST must be of the form f(c)\\\\ dc\\\\ d \\\\frac{1}{x} = f \\\\left ( \\\\frac{1}{x} + y \\\\right ) \\\\frac{1}{x^2} dx\\\\ dy Accounting for the symmetry P(x, y)= P(y, x), this becomes f(c)= c‚àí2 and hence (after normalization) (its integration over x+ or x‚Äì yields the function w(x) ). The reduction of the transformation to one-to-one mapping was used already by Chernoff and Barrow and they obtained a formula of the form of but for other variables; their paper does not contain applications to the problems which are considered in Khalatnikov et al. The correctness of be verified also by a direct calculation; the Jacobian of the transformation is J = \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\left ( x_{s+1}^{+}, x_{s+1}^{-} \\\\right )}{\\\\partial \\\\left ( x_{s}^{+}, x_{s}^{-} \\\\right )} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial x_{s+1}^{+}}{\\\\partial x_{s}^{+}} \\\\frac{\\\\partial x_{s+1}^{-}}{\\\\partial x_{s}^{-}} = \\\\left ( \\\\frac{x_{s+1}^{+}} {x_{s}^{+}} \\\\right )^2 (in its calculation one must note that \\\\left [ 1/x_{s}^{+} \\\\right ] + \\\\left \\\\\\\\{ 1/x_{s}^{+} \\\\right \\\\\\\\} = 1/x_{s}^{+}). Figure 5. The probability distribution function P(Œ¥). Red line: exact function . Blue line: approximate solution of the integral equation in. Both curves appear to be strikingly similar and the means of both distributions are 0.50.The plot of the function P(Œ¥) in Fig. 2 in is incorrect for several reasons. Apparently some errors were admitted in preparing the program for numerical solution of the integral equation. Also a \\"forced\\" reduction of the values P(0) and P(1) was performed in view of the incorrect footnote in . The finite probability of the value Œ¥ = 0 does not mean the possibility of the initial amplitude of oscillation becoming zero (which would be in contradiction to the regular course of evolution shown in Fig. 4). From Œ¥s+1 tends to zero with xs ‚Üí 0 proportional to xs; but the amplitude is given by the product Œ¥s+1Œ©s+1, which tends to a finite limit since the expression contains a term with 1/xs. Since by Œ¥s is expressed in terms of the random quantities x+ and x‚àí, the knowledge of their joint distribution makes it possible to calculate the statistical distribution P(Œ¥) by integrating P(x+, x‚àí) over one of the variables at a constant value of Œ¥. Due to symmetry of the function with respect to the variables x+ and x‚àí, P(Œ¥) = P(1 ‚àí Œ¥), i.e., the function P(Œ¥) is symmetrical with respect to the point Œ¥ = 1/2. Then P(\\\\delta)\\\\ d\\\\delta = d\\\\delta \\\\int_0^1 P \\\\left ( x^{+}, \\\\frac{x^{+} \\\\delta}{1 - \\\\delta} \\\\right ) \\\\left ( \\\\frac{\\\\partial x^{-}}{\\\\partial \\\\delta} \\\\right )_{x^{+}} d x^{+} On evaluating this integral (for 0 ‚â§ Œ¥ ‚â§ 1/2 and then making use of the aforementioned symmetry), finally The mean value \\\\bar{\\\\delta}= 1/2 already as a result of the symmetry of the function P(Œ¥). Thus the mean value of the initial (in every era) amplitude of oscillations of the functions Œ±, Œ≤, Œ≥ increases as Œ©/2. The statistical relation between large time intervals Œ© and the number of eras s contained in them is found by repeated application of : {\\\\Omega^{(0)}} = \\\\exp \\\\left ( \\\\sum_{p=0}^{s-1} \\\\xi^{(p)} \\\\right ).}} Direct averaging of this equation, however, does not make sense: because of the slow decrease of function W(k) , the average values of the quantity exp Œæ(s) are unstable in the above sense ‚Äì the fluctuations increase even more rapidly than the mean value itself with increasing region of averaging. This instability is eliminated by taking the logarithm: the \\"doubly-logarithmic\\" time interval {\\\\Omega^{(0)}} \\\\right ) = \\\\ln  \\\\ln t_s  - \\\\ln  \\\\ln t_0  = \\\\sum_{p=0}^{s-1} \\\\xi^{(p)} }} is expressed by the sum of quantities Œæ(p) which have a stable statistical distribution. The mean value of œÑ is \\\\bar{\\\\tau} = s \\\\bar{\\\\xi}. To calculate \\\\bar{\\\\xi} note that can be rewritten as For the stationary distribution \\\\overline{\\\\ln x_s} = \\\\overline{\\\\ln x_{s-1}}, and in virtue of the symmetry of the function P(Œ¥) also \\\\overline{\\\\ln \\\\delta_s} = \\\\overline{\\\\ln \\\\left ( \\\\delta_{s+1} \\\\right )}. Hence \\\\bar{\\\\xi} = -2 \\\\overline{\\\\ln x} = -2 \\\\int_0^1 w (x) \\\\ln x\\\\ dx = \\\\frac{\\\\pi^2}{6 \\\\ln 2} = 2.37 (w(x) from ). Thus which determines the mean doubly-logarithmic time interval containing s successive eras. For large s the number of terms in the sum is large and according to general theorems of the ergodic theory the values of œÑs are distributed around \\\\overline{\\\\tau_s} according to Gauss' law with the density Calculation of the variance DœÑ is more complicated since not only the knowledge of \\\\bar{\\\\xi} and \\\\overline{\\\\xi^2} are needed but also of the correlations \\\\overline{\\\\xi_p \\\\xi_{p \\\\prime}}. The calculation can be simplified by rearranging the terms in the sum . By using the sum can be rewritten as \\\\sum_{p=1}^s \\\\xi_p = \\\\ln \\\\prod_{p=1}^s \\\\frac{\\\\delta_p}{\\\\left (1 - \\\\delta_{p+1} \\\\right ) x_p x_{p-1}} = \\\\ln \\\\prod_{p=1}^s \\\\frac{\\\\delta_p}{\\\\left (1 - \\\\delta_{p} \\\\right ) x_{p-1}^2} + \\\\ln \\\\frac{x_0}{x_s} + \\\\ln \\\\frac{1 - \\\\delta_1}{1 - \\\\delta_{s+1}} The last two terms do not increase with increasing s; these terms can be omitted as the limiting laws for large s are dominating. Then {x_p^{+}}}} (the expression for Œ¥p is taken into account). To the same accuracy (i.e., up to the terms which do not increase with s) the equality is valid. Indeed, in virtue of x_{p+1}^{+} + \\\\frac{1}{x_{p+1}^{-}} = \\\\frac{1}{x_p^{+}} + x_p^{-} and hence \\\\ln \\\\left ( 1 + x_{p+1}^{+} x_{p+1}^{-} \\\\right ) - \\\\ln x_{p+1}^{-} = \\\\ln \\\\left ( 1 + x_{p}^{+} x_{p}^{-} \\\\right ) - \\\\ln x_{p}^{+} By summing this identity over p is obtained. Finally again with the same accuracy x_p^{+} is changed for xp under the summation sign and thus represent œÑs as The variance of this sum in the limit of large s is {{NumBlk:D_{{\\\\tau}_s} = \\\\overline{ \\\\left (\\\\tau_s - \\\\overline{\\\\tau_s} \\\\right )^2} \\\\approx s \\\\left \\\\\\\\{ \\\\overline{\\\\eta^2} - \\\\bar{\\\\eta}^2 + 2 \\\\sum_{p=1}^{\\\\infty} \\\\left ( \\\\overline{\\\\eta_0 \\\\eta_p} - \\\\bar{\\\\eta}^2 \\\\right ) \\\\right \\\\\\\\}}} It is taken into account that in virtue of the statistical homogeneity of the sequence X the correlations \\\\overline{\\\\eta_p \\\\eta_{p \\\\prime}} depend only on the differences p ‚àí p‚Ä≤. The mean value \\\\bar{\\\\eta} = \\\\bar{\\\\xi}; the mean square \\\\overline{\\\\eta^2} = 4 \\\\int_0^1 w(x) \\\\ln^2 x\\\\ dx = \\\\frac{6 \\\\xi (3)}{\\\\ln 2} = 10.40 By taking into account also the values of correlations \\\\overline{\\\\eta_0 \\\\eta_p} with p = 1, 2, 3 (calculated numerically) the final result DœÑs = (3.5 ¬± 0.1)s is obtained. At increasing s the relative fluctuation D_{{\\\\tau}_s} / \\\\overline{\\\\tau_s} tends to zero as s‚àí1/2. In other words, the statistical relation becomes almost certain at large s. This makes it possible to invert the relation, i.e., to represent it as the dependence of the average number of the eras sœÑ that are interchanged in a given interval œÑ of the double logarithmic time: = 0.47\\\\tau.}} The statistical distribution of the exact values of sœÑ around its average is also Gaussian with the variance D_{s_{\\\\tau}} = 3.5 \\\\frac{\\\\overline{s_{\\\\tau}}^3}{\\\\tau^2} = 0.26 \\\\tau The respective statistical distribution is given by the same Gaussian distribution in which the random variable is now sœÑ at a given œÑ: From this point of view, the source of the statistical behavior is the arbitrariness in the choice of the starting point of the interval œÑ superimposed on the infinite sequence of the interchanging eras. Respective to matter density, can be re-written with account of in the form :\\\\ln \\\\ln \\\\frac{\\\\varepsilon^{(s+1)}}{\\\\varepsilon^{(s)}} = \\\\eta_s + \\\\sum_{p=0}^{s-1} \\\\xi_p, \\\\quad \\\\eta_s = \\\\ln \\\\left [ 2\\\\delta^{(s)} \\\\left ( k^{(s)} + x^{(s)} - 1 \\\\right ) \\\\Omega^{(0)} \\\\right ] and then, for the total energy change during s eras, {\\\\varepsilon^{(0)}} = \\\\ln \\\\sum_{p=0}^{s-1} \\\\exp \\\\left \\\\\\\\{ \\\\sum_{q=0}^p\\\\xi_q + \\\\eta_p \\\\right \\\\\\\\}.}} The term with the sum by p gives the main contribution to this expression because it contains an exponent with a large power. Leaving only this term and averaging , one gets in its right hand side the expression s\\\\bar{\\\\xi} which coincides with ; all other terms in the sum (also terms with Œ∑s in their powers) lead only to corrections of a relative order 1/s. Therefore, {\\\\varepsilon^{(0)}} \\\\right )} = \\\\overline{\\\\ln \\\\left ( \\\\frac{\\\\Omega^{(s)}}{\\\\Omega^{(0)}} \\\\right )}.}} By virtue of the almost certain character of the relation between œÑs and s can be written as :\\\\overline{\\\\ln \\\\ln \\\\left ( \\\\varepsilon_\\\\tau/\\\\varepsilon^{(0)} \\\\right )} = \\\\tau \\\\quad \\\\text{or} \\\\quad \\\\overline{\\\\ln \\\\ln \\\\left ( \\\\varepsilon^{(s)}/\\\\varepsilon^{(0)} \\\\right )} = 2.1 s, which determines the value of the double logarithm of density increase averaged by given double- logarithmic time intervals œÑ or by a given number of eras s. These stable statistical relationships exist specifically for doubly-logarithmic time intervals and for the density increase. For other characteristics, e.g., ln (Œµ(s)/Œµ(0)) or Œ©(s) / Œ©(0) = exp œÑs the relative fluctuation increase exponentially with the increase of the averaging range thereby voiding the term mean value of a stable meaning. The origin of the statistical relationship can be traced already from the initial law governing the variation of the density during the individual Kasner epochs. According to , during the entire evolution we have \\\\ln \\\\ln \\\\varepsilon (t) = \\\\text{const} + \\\\ln \\\\Omega + \\\\ln 2 (1 - p_3 (t)), with 1 ‚àí p3(t) changing from epoch to epoch, running through values in the interval from 0 to 1. The term ln Œ© = ln ln (1/t) increases monotonically; on the other hand, the term ln2(1 ‚àí p3) can assume large values (comparable with ln Œ©) only when values of p3 very close to unity appear (i.e., very small p1). These are precisely the \\"dangerous\\" cases that disturb the regular course of evolution expressed by the recurrent relationships ‚Äì. It remains to show that such cases actually do not arise in the asymptotic limiting regime. The spontaneous evolution of the model starts at a certain instant at which definite initial conditions are specified in an arbitrary manner. Accordingly, by \\"asymptotic\\" is meant a regime sufficiently far away from the chosen initial instant. Dangerous cases are those in which excessively small values of the parameter u = x (and hence also p1 ‚âà x) appear at the end of an era. A criterion for selection of such cases is the inequality where  Œ±(s)  is the initial minima depth of the functions that oscillate in era s (it would be more appropriate to choose the final amplitude, but that would only strengthen the selection criterion). The value of x(0) in the first era is determined by the initial conditions. Dangerous are values in the interval Œ¥x(0) ~ exp ( ‚àí Œ±(0) ), and also in intervals that could result in dangerous cases in the next eras. In order for x(s) to fall in the dangerous interval Œ¥x(s) ~ exp ( ‚àí  Œ±(s)  ), the initial value x(0) should lie into an interval of a width Œ¥x(0) ~ Œ¥x(s) / k(1)^2 ... k(s)^2. Therefore, from a unit interval of all possible values of x(0), dangerous cases will appear in parts Œª of this interval: }} (the inner sum is taken over all the values k(1), k(2), ... , k(s) from 1 to ‚àû). It is easy to show that this era converges to the value Œª \\\\ll 1 whose order of magnitude is determined by the first term in . This can be shown by a strong majoration of the era for which one substitutes  Œ±(s)  = (s + 1)  Œ±(0) , regardless of the lengths of eras k(1), k(2), ... (In fact  Œ±(s)  increase much faster; even in the most unfavorable case k(1) = k(2) = ... = 1 values of  Œ±(s)  increase as qs  Œ±(0)  with q > 1.) Noting that :\\\\sum_k \\\\frac{1}{k^{(1)^2} k^{(2)^2} \\\\dots k^{(s)^2}} = \\\\left ( \\\\pi^2 / 6 \\\\right )^s one obtains :\\\\lambda = \\\\exp \\\\left ( \\\\left -\\\\alpha^{(0)} \\\\right  \\\\right )\\\\sum_{s=0}^\\\\infty \\\\left [ \\\\left ( \\\\pi^2 / 6 \\\\right ) \\\\exp \\\\left ( \\\\left -\\\\alpha^{(0)} \\\\right  \\\\right ) \\\\right ]^s \\\\approx \\\\exp \\\\left ( \\\\left -\\\\alpha^{(0)} \\\\right  \\\\right ). If the initial value of x(0) lies outside the dangerous region Œª there will be no dangerous cases. If it lies inside this region dangerous cases occur, but upon their completion the model resumes a \\"regular\\" evolution with a new initial value which only occasionally (with a probability Œª) may come into the dangerous interval. Repeated dangerous cases occur with probabilities Œª2, Œª3, ... , asymptotically converging to zero. General solution with small oscillations In the above models, metric evolution near the singularity is studied on the example of homogeneous space metrics. It is clear from the characteristic of this evolution that the analytic construction of the general solution for a singularity of such type should be made separately for each of the basic evolution components: for the Kasner epochs, for the process of transitions between epochs caused by \\"perturbations\\", for long eras with two perturbations acting simultaneously. During a Kasner epoch (i.e. at small perturbations), the metric is given by without the condition Œª = 0. BKL further developed a matter distribution- independent model (homogeneous or non-homogeneous) for long era with small oscillations. The time dependence of this solution turns out to be very similar to that in the particular case of homogeneous models; the latter can be obtained from the distribution-independent model by a special choice of the arbitrary functions contained in it. It is convenient, however, to construct the general solution in a system of coordinates somewhat different from synchronous reference frame: g0Œ± = 0 as in the synchronous frame, but instead of g00 = 1 it is now g00 = ‚àíg33. Defining again the space metric tensor Œ≥Œ±Œ≤ = ‚àígŒ±Œ≤ one has, therefore The special space coordinate is written as x3 = z and the time coordinate is written as x0 = Œæ (as different from proper time t); it will be shown that Œæ corresponds to the same variable defined in homogeneous models. Differentiation by Œæ and z is designated, respectively, by dot and prime. Latin indices a, b, c take values 1, 2, corresponding to space coordinates x1, x2 which will be also written as x, y. Therefore, the metric is The required solution should satisfy the inequalities (these conditions specify that one of the functions a2, b2, c2 is small compared to the other two which was also the case with homogeneous models). Inequality means that components Œ≥a3 are small in the sense that at any ratio of the shifts dxa and dz, terms with products dxadz can be omitted in the square of the spatial length element dl2. Therefore, the first approximation to a solution is a metric with Œ≥a3 = 0:Note that this metric allows arbitrary transformations of type Œæ‚Ä≤ + z‚Ä≥ = f1 (Œæ + z), Œæ‚Ä≤ ‚àí z‚Ä≤ = f2 (Œæ ‚àí z), x‚Ä≤a = fa (x1, x2). One can be easily convinced by calculating the Ricci tensor components R_0^0, R_3^0, R_3^3, R_a^b using metric and the condition that all terms containing derivatives by coordinates xa are small compared to terms with derivatives by Œæ and z (their ratio is ~ Œ≥33 / Œ≥ab). In other words, to obtain the equations of the main approximation, Œ≥33 and Œ≥ab in should be differentiated as if they do not depend on xa. Designating one obtains the following equations:The equation R_0^0 + R_3^3 = 0 is a direct result of ‚Äì if \\\\dot G eq 0 or G^\\\\prime eq 0. The case \\\\dot G = G^\\\\prime = 0 does not require a special treatment: it can be shown that the spacetime metric in this case converges (in first approximation) to Galilean. Index raising and lowering is done here with the help of Œ≥ab. The quantities \\\\varkappa and Œª are the contractions \\\\varkappa_a^a and \\\\lambda_a^a whereby As to the Ricci tensor components R_a^0, R_a^3, by this calculation they are identically zero. In the next approximation (i.e., with account to small Œ≥a3 and derivatives by x, y), they determine the quantities Œ≥a3 by already known Œ≥33 and Œ≥ab. Contraction of gives G^{\\\\prime\\\\prime} + \\\\ddot G = 0, and, hence, Different cases are possible depending on the G variable. In the above case g00 = Œ≥33 \\\\gg Œ≥ab and N \\\\approx g^{00} \\\\left ( \\\\dot G \\\\right )^2 - \\\\gamma^{33} \\\\left ( G^\\\\prime \\\\right )^2 = 4 \\\\gamma^{33} \\\\dot{f}_1 \\\\dot{f}_2. The case N > 0 (quantity N is time-like) leads to time singularities of interest. Substituting in f1 = 1/2 (Œæ + z) sin y, f2 = 1/2 (Œæ ‚àí z) sin y results in G of type This choice does not diminish the generality of conclusions; it can be shown that generality is possible (in the first approximation) just on account of the remaining permissible transformations of variables. At N < 0 (quantity N is space-like) one can substitute G = z which generalizes the well-known Einstein‚ÄìRosen metric. At N = 0 one arrives at the Robinson‚ÄìBondi wave metric that depends only on Œæ + z or only on Œæ ‚àí z (cf. ). The factor sin y in is put for convenient comparison with homogeneous models. Taking into account , equations ‚Äì become The principal equations are defining the Œ≥ab components; then, function œà is found by a simple integration of ‚Äì. The variable Œæ runs through the values from 0 to ‚àû. The solution of is considered at two boundaries, Œæ \\\\gg 1 and \\\\ll 1\\\\. At large Œæ values, one can look for a solution that takes the form of a 1 / decomposition: whereby (equation needs condition to be true). Substituting in , one obtains in the first order ^\\\\prime a_{bc} \\\\right )}^\\\\prime = 0, }} where quantities aac constitute a matrix that is inverse to matrix aac. The solution of has the form where la, ma, œÅ, are arbitrary functions of coordinates x, y bound by condition derived from . To find higher terms of this decomposition, it is convenient to write the matrix of required quantities Œ≥ab in the form where the symbol ~ means matrix transposition. Matrix H is symmetric and its trace is zero. Presentation ensures symmetry of Œ≥ab and fulfillment of condition . If exp H is substituted with 1, one obtains from Œ≥ab = Œæaab with aab from . In other words, the first term of Œ≥ab decomposition corresponds to H = 0; higher terms are obtained by powers decomposition of matrix H whose components are considered small. The independent components of matrix H are written as œÉ and œÜ so that Substituting in and leaving only terms linear by H, one derives for œÉ and œÜ :\\\\ddot{\\\\sigma}+\\\\xi^{-1}\\\\dot{\\\\sigma}-\\\\sigma^{\\\\prime\\\\prime}=0, If one tries to find a solution to these equations as Fourier series by the z coordinate, then for the series coefficients, as functions of Œæ, one obtains Bessel equations. The major asymptotic terms of the solution at large Œæ areIt is possible to look for a solution in the form of Fourier integrals; this issue has not been studied in detail. Therefore, BKL do not require Fourier series decomposition as a mandatory condition for the coordinate dependence of functions œÉ and œÜ :\\\\sigma = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\xi}}\\\\sum_{n=-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\left ( A_{1n} e^{in\\\\omega\\\\xi}+B_{1n} e^{-in\\\\omega\\\\xi} \\\\right ) e^{in\\\\omega z}, \\\\sum_{n=-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\left ( A_{2n} e^{in\\\\omega\\\\xi}+B_{2n} e^{-in\\\\omega\\\\xi} \\\\right ) e^{in\\\\omega z},}} :\\\\omega_n^2 = n^2\\\\omega^2+4\\\\rho^2. Coefficients A and B are arbitrary complex functions of coordinates x, y and satisfy the necessary conditions for real œÉ and œÜ; the base frequency œâ is an arbitrary real function of x, y. Now from ‚Äì it is easy to obtain the first term of the function œà: (this term vanishes if œÅ = 0; in this case the major term is the one linear for Œæ from the decomposition: œà = Œæq (x, y) where q is a positive function). Therefore, at large Œæ values, the components of the metric tensor Œ≥ab oscillate upon decreasing Œæ on the background of a slow decrease caused by the decreasing Œæ factor in . The component Œ≥33 = eœà decreases quickly by a law close to exp (œÅ2Œæ2); this makes it possible for condition .Squared H terms in result only in small (‚âà1/Œæ) corrections in œÉ and œÜ. Calculation with cubic terms leads to appearance of a weak dependence of A, B from Œæ that can be presented as an appearance of logarithmic phases in the oscillating factors in . These calculations for the case œÅ = 0 are given in (cf. the analogous situation for homogeneous models, ). Next BKL consider the case Œæ \\\\ll 1\\\\. The first approximation to a solution of is found by the assumption (confirmed by the result) that in these equations terms with derivatives by coordinates can be left out: This equation together with the condition gives where Œªa, Œºa, s1, s2 are arbitrary functions of all 3 coordinates x, y, z, which are related with other conditions Equations ‚Äì give now The derivatives {\\\\lambda_a^b}^\\\\prime, calculated by , contain terms ~ Œæ4s1 ‚àí 2 and ~ Œæ4s2 ‚àí 2 while terms left in are ~ Œæ‚àí2. Therefore, application of instead of is permitted on conditions s1 > 0, s2 > 0; hence 1 ‚àí s_1^2 - s_2^2 > 0. Thus, at small Œæ oscillations of functions Œ≥ab cease while function Œ≥33 begins to increase at decreasing Œæ. This is a Kasner mode and when Œ≥33 is compared to Œ≥ab, the above approximation is not applicable. In order to check the compatibility of this analysis, BKL studied the equations R_{\\\\alpha}^0 = 0, R_{\\\\alpha}^3 = 0, and, calculating from them the components Œ≥a3, confirmed that the inequality takes place. This study showed that in both asymptotic regions the components Œ≥a3 were ~ Œ≥33. Therefore, correctness of inequality immediately implies correctness of inequality . This solution contains, as it should for the general case of a field in vacuum, four arbitrary functions of the three space coordinates x, y, z. In the region Œæ \\\\ll 1 these functions are, e.g., Œª1, Œª2, Œº1, s1. In the region Œæ \\\\gg 1 the four functions are defined by the Fourier series by coordinate z from with coefficients that are functions of x, y; although Fourier series decomposition (or integral?) characterizes a special class of functions, this class is large enough to encompass any finite subset of the set of all possible initial conditions. The solution contains also a number of other arbitrary functions of the coordinates x, y. Such two-dimensional arbitrary functions appear, generally speaking, because the relationships between three-dimensional functions in the solutions of the Einstein equations are differential (and not algebraic), leaving aside the deeper problem about the geometric meaning of these functions. BKL did not calculate the number of independent two-dimensional functions because in this case it is hard to make unambiguous conclusions since the three-dimensional functions are defined by a set of two-dimensional functions (cf. for more details).The regular decomposition of the general solution of Einstein equations contains (in addition to the four three- dimensional functions) three independent functions of two coordinates (cf. ; ) Finally, BKL go on to show that the general solution contains the particular solution obtained above for homogeneous models. Substituting the basis vectors for Bianchi Type IX homogeneous space in the space-time metric of this model takes the form When c2 \\\\ll a2, b2, one can ignore c2 everywhere except in the term c2 dz2. To move from the synchronous frame used in to a frame with conditions , the transformation dt = c dŒæ/2 and substitution z ‚Üí z/2 are done. Assuming also that œá ‚â° ln (a/b) \\\\ll 1, one obtains from in the first approximation: Similarly, with the basis vectors of Bianchi Type VIII homogeneous space, one obtains According to the analysis of homogeneous spaces above, in both cases ab = Œæ (simplifying a_0^2 = Œæ0) and œá is from ; function c (Œæ) is given by formulae and , respectively, for models of Types IX and VIII. Identical metric for Type VIII is obtained from , , choosing two- dimensional vectors la and ma in the form \\\\sin{y}, \\\\qquad l_2 = m_2 = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}} }} and substituting To obtain the metric for Type IX, one should substitute (for calculation of c (Œæ) the approximation in is not sufficient and the term in œà linear by Œæ is calculated) This analysis was done for empty space. Including matter does not make the solution less general and does not change its qualitative characteristics. A limitation of great importance for the general solution is that all 3-dimensional functions contained in the metrics and should have a single and common characteristic change interval. Only this allows to approximate in the Einstein equations all metric spatial component derivatives with simple products of these components by a characteristic wave numbers which results in ordinary differential equations of the type obtained for the Type IX homogeneous model. This is the reason for the coincidence between homogeneous and general solutions. It follows that both Type IX model and its generalisation contain an oscillatory mode with a single spatial scale of an arbitrary magnitude which is not selected among others by any physical conditions. However, it is known that in non-linear systems with infinite degrees of freedom such mode is unstable and partially dissipates to smaller oscillations. In the general case of small perturbations with an arbitrary spectrum, there will always be some whose amplitudes will increase feeding upon the total process energy. As a result, a complicated picture arises of multi-scale movements with certain energy distribution and energy exchange between oscillations of different scales. It doesn't occur only in the case when the development of small-scale oscillations is impossible because of physical conditions. For the latter, some natural physical length must exist which determines the minimal scale at which energy exits from a system with dynamical degrees of freedom (which, for example, occurs in a liquid with a certain viscosity). However, there is no innate physical scale for a gravitational field in vacuum, and, therefore, there is no impediment for the development of oscillations of arbitrarily small scales. Conclusions BKL describe singularities in the cosmologic solution of Einstein equations that have a complicated oscillatory character. Although these singularities have been studied primarily on spatially homogeneous models, there are convincing reasons to assume that singularities in the general solution of Einstein equations have the same characteristics; this circumstance makes the BKL model important for cosmology. A basis for such statement is the fact that the oscillatory mode in the approach to singularity is caused by the single perturbation that also causes instability in the generalized Kasner solution. A confirmation of the generality of the model is the analytic construction for long era with small oscillations. Although this latter behavior is not a necessary element of metric evolution close to the singularity, it has all principal qualitative properties: metric oscillation in two spatial dimensions and monotonous change in the third dimension with a certain perturbation of this mode at the end of some time interval. However, the transitions between Kasner epochs in the general case of non-homogeneous spatial metric have not been elucidated in details. The problem connected with the possible limitations upon space geometry caused by the singularity was left aside for further study. It is clear from the outset, however, that the original BKL model is applicable to both finite or infinite space; this is evidenced by the existence of oscillatory singularity models for both closed and open spacetimes. The oscillatory mode of the approach to singularity gives a new aspect to the term 'finiteness of time'. Between any finite moment of the world time t and the moment t = 0 there is an infinite number of oscillations. In this sense, the process acquires an infinite character. Instead of time t, a more adequate variable for its description is ln t by which the process is extended to -\\\\infty. BKL consider metric evolution in the direction of decreasing time. The Einstein equations are symmetric in respect to the time sign so that a metric evolution in the direction of increasing time is equally possible. However, these two cases are fundamentally different because past and future are not equivalent in the physical sense. Future singularity can be physically meaningful only if it is possible at arbitrary initial conditions existing in a previous moment. Matter distribution and fields in some moment in the evolution of Universe do not necessarily correspond to the specific conditions required for the existence of a given special solution to the Einstein equations. The choice of solutions corresponding to the real world is related to profound physical requirements which is impossible to find using only the existing relativity theory and which can be found as a result of future synthesis of physical theories. Thus, it may turn out that this choice singles out some special (e.g., isotropic) type of singularity. Nevertheless, it is more natural to assume that because of its general character, the oscillatory mode should be the main characteristic of the initial evolutionary stages. In this respect, of considerable interest is the property of the \\"Mixmaster\\" model shown by Misner, related to propagation of light signals. In the isotropic model, a \\"light horizon\\" exists, meaning that for each moment of time, there is some longest distance, at which exchange of light signals and, thus, a causal connection, is impossible: the signal cannot reach such distances for the time since the singularity t = 0. Signal propagation is determined by the equation ds = 0. In the isotropic model near the singularity t = 0 the interval element is ds^2 = dt^2 - 2 t d \\\\bar{l}^2, where d \\\\bar{l}^2 is a time-independent spatial differential form. Substituting t = \\\\eta^2 / 2 yields The \\"distance\\" \\\\Delta \\\\bar l reached by the signal is Since Œ∑, like t, runs through values starting from 0, up to the \\"moment\\" Œ∑ signals can propagate only at the distance \\\\Delta \\\\bar{l} \\\\le \\\\eta which fixes the farthest distance to the horizon. The existence of a light horizon in the isotropic model poses a problem in the understanding of the origin of the presently observed isotropy in the relic radiation. According to the isotropic model, the observed isotropy means isotropic properties of radiation that comes to the observer from such regions of space that can not be causally connected with each other. The situation in the oscillatory evolution model near the singularity can be different. For example, in the homogeneous model for Type IX space, a signal is propagated in a direction in which for a long era, scales change by a law close to ~ t. The square of the distance element in this direction is dl2 = t2\\\\bar{l}^2, and the respective element of the four-dimensional interval is ds^2 = dt^2 - t^2 \\\\bar{l}^2. The substitution t = e^{\\\\eta} puts this in the form and for the signal propagation one has equation of the type again. The important difference is that the variable Œ∑ runs now through values starting from -\\\\infty (if metric is valid for all t starting from t = 0). Therefore, for each given \\"moment\\" Œ∑ are found intermediate intervals ŒîŒ∑ sufficient for the signal to cover each finite distance. In this way, during a long era a light horizon is opened in a given space direction. Although the duration of each long era is still finite, during the course of the world evolution eras change an infinite number of times in different space directions. This circumstance makes one expect that in this model a causal connection between events in the whole space is possible. Because of this property, Misner named this model \\"Mixmaster universe\\" by a brand name of a dough-blending machine. As time passes and one goes away from the singularity, the effect of matter on metric evolution, which was insignificant at the early stages of evolution, gradually increases and eventually becomes dominant. It can be expected that this effect will lead to a gradual \\"isotropisation\\" of space as a result of which its characteristics come closer to the Friedman model which adequately describes the present state of the Universe. Finally, BKL pose the problem about the feasibility of considering a \\"singular state\\" of a world with infinitely dense matter on the basis of the existing relativity theory. The physical application of the Einstein equations in their present form in these conditions can be made clear only in the process of a future synthesis of physical theories and in this sense the problem can not be solved at present. It is important that the gravitational theory itself does not lose its logical cohesion (i.e., does not lead to internal controversies) at whatever matter densities. In other words, this theory is not limited by the conditions that it imposes, which could make logically inadmissible and controversial its application at very large densities; limitations could, in principle, appear only as a result of factors that are \\"external\\" to the gravitational theory. This circumstance makes the study of singularities in cosmological models formally acceptable and necessary in the frame of existing theory.

A contemporary of the renowned Macchi C.202, the production of this type was to be limited to only 252, but it was a flexible design that proved to be able to undertake a number of roles. Thanks to its maneuverability it could dogfight with more powerful opponents like the Supermarine Spitfire. The Re.2001 became the basis of a later, more formidable fighter, the Re.2005. Design and development The Reggiane Re.2001 was a development of the Re.2000 Falco I which had been rejected by the Regia Aeronautica primarily because of its unprotected fuel tanks in the wing, which were merely sealed voids between the spars, and secondly its engine. This was the main problem the Falco II set out to fix, now having a 1,175 hp Alfa Romeo inline engine (a more powerful and reliable license-built German DB 601) rather than a 986 hp Piaggio P.IX radial engine. Incorporating much of the Re.2000's fuselage structure, even retaining the entire tail unit, the Re.2001's wings were of semi-elliptical design with three spars in each wing. The initial design had conventional fuel tanks with 544 l total capacity (five tanks, one in the fuselage and the others in the wings). The armament consisted of Breda-SAFAT machine guns, with two nose- mounted 12.7 mm (up to 800 rounds) and two 7.7 mm guns in the wings, (1200 rounds total). The new Falco II was considered equal by most experts with the Macchi MC.202, but the Macchi fighter, having first call on production for the Alfa Romeo R.A.1000RC.41-1a (the license built DB 601) was still produced in greater numbers. The Re.2001 was then delayed because the Regia Aeronautica insisted on the fuel tanks being placed inside the wings, which required a substantial redesign of the wing structure. The first order, amounting to 300 machines, was cut back with only 252 produced. This number included 100 Re.2001 Serie I, Serie II and Serie III with armament variations, the Reggiane Serie IV fighter-bomber and 150 Re.2001 CN Caccia Notturna, night fighter. Due to the wing redesign coupled with production delays, the first production aircraft were finally cleared for operational use in June 1941, nearly a year behind schedule. Along with the fighter variant, two other main variants were developed to suit specialized roles. The Re.2001 CB (Cacciabombardiere, Fighter-bomber) version produced from 1942 could carry a 100 or 250 kg bomb under the fuselage for the attack role. The CN (Caccia notturno, Night fighter) version was adapted with the introduction of engine exhaust-flame dampers and a 20 mm Mauser MG 151/20 cannon in two gondolas, one under each wing, although many fighters retained the original armament. A total of 34 CNs were produced of the 50 ordered. Operational history Reggiane Re.2001. The Re.2001 reached operational status late in 1941 with 2¬∞ Gruppo (part of 6¬∞ Stormo) that had returned from North Africa without aircraft in September 1941. Its three Squadriglie, 150¬™, 152¬™ and 358¬™, were based at Gorizia and then relocated to Rome-Ciampino in December. But due to technical reasons the unit was not fully equipped and trained until February 1942. Finally, on 4 May 1942, it moved to Caltagirone, in Sicily, with 18 Reggianes, under command of Colonnello Bajlon. In May 1942, Re.2001s began to fly escort missions over Malta, encountering British Spitfire Mk Vs. The first encounter took place on 12 May, when 15 Reggiane 2001s of 2¬∞ Gruppo, while escorting (with Macchi MC.200s) three Savoia-Marchetti SM.84 of 4¬∞ Gruppo, were attacked by nine Spitfires, and the Reggiane downed two British fighters for no losses to themselves. During the violent air combat, the Supermarine fighters shot down a Regia Aeronautica bomber and badly damaged the other, but the Reggiane pilots quickly reacted and shot down two Spitfires, one by Sergente Paolo Morcino, that had to make a crash-landing (just like his commander) close to Ispica, as his undercarriage had been damaged by a 20 mm cannon shell. That day actually the RAF lost three Spitfires: one pilot, Sergeant Charles Graysmark of 601 Sqn was killed and another, Sergeant Cyril 'Joe' Bush of (126 Squadron), wounded. Pilot Officer Michael Graves, 126 Sqn, was also shot down but bailed out uninjured. In the afternoon of 15 May 1942, 19 Re.2001s flew to the airfields at Malta on a hunting spree. Dogfights took place over the southern part of the island and according to the Italians, the Allies lost four aircraft, three falling into the sea east of Valletta and the fourth, south of Kalafrana. Re.2001 MM.7210, hit during the dogfight, made an emergency landing at Comiso, in Sicily. On 18 May, eight Re.2001s led by Tenente Remo Cazzolli of 152¬™ Squadriglia flew to Malta in support of a maritime/land reconnaissance of the island. The Re.2001s were attacked by four Spitfires of 249 Squadron, three pilots each claiming a Reggiane. Later records show that Cazzolli, a Spanish Civil War veteran, was the lone victim, crashing north of Fort San Leonardo, near Marsaskala, and was captured. By the end of June, 22¬∞ Gruppo based at Rome-Ciampino received their first Re.2001 CBs and redeployed to Monserrato, Sardinia. They were later transferred to Sicily to participate in the raids on Malta. On 12 July, over Malta, Canadian ace \\"Buzz\\" Beurling from 249 Sqn shot down the Reggiane Re.2001s of Tenente Colonnello Aldo Quarantotti and Tenente Carlo Seganti, of 150¬™ Squadriglia Caccia, mistaking them for Macchi C.202s. But two days later, he was in turn badly shot up by Reggianes. Beurling's aircraft was \\"riddled by better than 20 bullets through the fuselage and wings\\". \\"An explosive bullet nicked my right heel\\", he recalled. Generally slower than contemporary fighters, still the Reggiane against the Hawker Hurricane fared better and could take on this opponent on a more equal basis, although the Hawker was noticeably faster at most altitudes. The Spitfire V had an even more greater speed advantage. especially above 7,000 m (23,000 ft). However, at lower and medium altitudes, the Re.2001 was able to hold its own and, in the hands of an expert pilot, as ace Laddie Lucas recalled in his Malta: The Thorn in Rommel's side, the Reggiane could be a difficult and dangerous opponent for the Spitfire V. > On 13 July 1942, 249 Squadron was engaged high above Malta with a mixed > force of German and Italian fighters.

But, as we turned back to base, the Italian, to my amazement, > turned with us and made one final and defiant attack upon our section - as > if to show what he thought of a pair of Spitfires!\\" On 12 August 1942, two Re.2001G/Vs, modified to carry single 640 kg (1,410 lb) fragmentation bombs and accompanied by a fighter escort of Re.2001s, carried out a successful attack on during Operation Pedestal. Reportedly, the Re.2001s were not challenged because of their similarity in appearance to Sea Hurricanes. During the attack, a direct hit was scored on the aircraft carrier's flight deck but the bomb failed to explode and fell harmlessly into the sea. Beginning in spring 1942, Reggiane Re.2001 CN night fighters were issued to 59¬∞ Gruppo, and primarily used in the defence of Italian cities. As the tide of war shifted, the Re.2001 units were constantly moved from base to base, and finally by 10 July 1943, when the invasion of Sicily began, all available Re.2001 fighters were diverted to defend Italy and nearby Mediterranean islands held by Italian forces. Later in 1943, the fighter in all of its variants was used to defend northern and central Italy. Fighter pilots praised the Re.2001's handling qualities (some considered it more maneuverable than the Macchi C.202); however, like many Italian combat aircraft, the type experienced poor serviceability and many of the units using the Re.2001 were not fully equipped. The complexity of the Re.2001 design led to higher costs (in 1942, the production cost of the Re.2001 was 600,000 lire versus 520,000 lire of the Macchi C.202) and slowed production rates which also limited its effectiveness as a fighter. Due to attrition, only 33 Re.2001s were available at the Armistice of 9 September 1943. Furthermore, poor serviceability meant that only nine Re.2001s survived the division of Italy, eight going to the Italian Co-Belligerent Air Force with the Allies, and one to the Italian Social Republic. Variants ;Re.2001 :Prototypes, two built. Second prototype had three-spar wing, modified canopy and fixed tailwheel.

First addition of wing-mounted machine guns to development and optional cannon, able to carry a 600 kg torpedo or bomb as standard. ;Re.2001 CN Serie III & IV :Night fighter and fighter-bomber version, 74 built. Optional bombload of up to 640 kg (1,410 lbs) or additional fuel tank on Serie IV. Two 20 mm Mauser MG 151/20 cannon (60 rounds each) were fitted in two gondolas, one under each wing. ;Re.2001 G/H :Experimental torpedo- (carrying a 600 kg torpedo) fighter or anti-tank version with lengthened tailwheel and two 20 mm cannons, two built. ;Re.2001 G/V :Modified fighter-bomber, with reinforced fuselage structure to carry a single 640 kg (1,410 lb) bomb with 120 kg HE, derived from a 381 mm shell (made for the Littorio-class battleships). A small number of the variant was built; two G/Vs took part in Operation Pedestal but this was the sole use of the variant. Model of the Re.2001 Delta ;Re.2001 Delta :Prototype version powered by 840 hp Isotta Fraschini Delta RC 16/48 engine, one built- first flight: 12 September 1942. After tests when a top speed of only 478 km/h at 5,760 m was reached, the Regia Aeronautica cancelled the 100 variants on order. ;Re.2001bis :Prototype (MM.438) version with repositioned radiators, one built; although flight trials were successful, proving to be the fastest of the Re.2001 variants, it was converted back to a standard Re.2001. Other variants were considered including a design for a dedicated anti-tank fighter (armed with 20 mm guns and anti-tank bomblets) and the Re.2001 Fotografico, a photo-reconnaissance version, although some standard Re.2001s were later modified for this role.

In 2005, P√©rez signed a developmental contract with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), where he worked for developmental territories Deep South Wrestling and Florida Championship Wrestling, winning the tag team championship in both and the FCW Florida Heavyweight Championship. In the fall of 2009, he was promoted to WWE's main roster as \\"Eric Escobar\\", appearing on the SmackDown brand. On January 17, 2010, he was released from his WWE contract. P√©rez subsequently returned to Puerto Rico, performing in the IWA and Puerto Rico Wrestling Association, winning the heavyweight titles of both promotions. Professional wrestling career =International Wrestling Association and World Wrestling Council (2000‚Äì2005)= P√©rez began his career in the International Wrestling Association in Puerto Rico, after receiving training with personnel from the company. Prior to debuting in professional wrestling P√©rez had always had an interest in wrestling fueled by World Wrestling Entertainment and Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling. P√©rez also stated that during his career he was inspired by the microphone skills of Chicky Starr and The Rock and by the in-ring ability of Kurt Angle. While visiting an event presented by the IWA in Carolina, Puerto Rico, P√©rez was approached by V√≠ctor Qui√±ones then president of the company, who asked to him if he was interested in receiving training to become a professional wrestler. His first angle with the company was as the leader of a group of young wrestlers titled Lucha Libre 101, originally composed of Bryan Madness (Roberto Rubio), Chicano (Carlos Cotto) and Abbad (Enrique Sinigaglia). Several of the members of Lucha Libre 101 were either injured or abandoned the company while it was in progress which led to it being cancelled. After the company terminated this angle he acted as host of a talk show segment, but he was not interested in the section and asked the company to give the role to Daniel Garcia Soto while he traveled to Mexico. Eric P√©rez at an FCW show in Ft. Myers, Florida While working in the IWA, P√©rez acquired a job to work with the Federal Government of the United States, this limited the number of days he could perform with the company, after seven months in this office he notified that he was not going to be able to continue working a four-day schedule, and attempted to dialogue the situation with the company's personnel. He was not able to contact staff of the company which led to him asking for a release, several months later a fellow wrestler called him and asked if he was available to work with the World Wrestling Council which led to a reunion between him and the company's vice president Carlos Col√≥n, Sr.. He noted in interviews that his experience with the company was good, although it was a long and tedious one based on the company's quality standards. While in IWA, P√©rez wrestled in the United States with !Bang! a promotion owned by Dory Funk, against wrestlers including Brent Dail and several of !Bang!'s champions. He subsequently worked with the World Wrestling Council, winning various titles there. =World Wrestling Entertainment (2005‚Äì2010)= Deep South Wrestling (2005‚Äì2007) During September 2005, P√©rez was contacted by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) for a development contract. He was assigned to their developmental territory, Deep South Wrestling and began working under the pseudonym \\"The Puerto Rican Nightmare\\" Eric P√©rez. During his time there, he wrestled in singles matches, in addition to teaming with Montel Vontavious Porter and later, Sonny Siaki with whom he formed the tag team, Urban Assault. The team won the Deep South Tag Team Championship once before the company finished its business relationship with WWE. On May 1, 2006, P√©rez competed in a tag team match at his first WWE house show. He would then appear at ECW house shows in late July and again on September 30. Alongside Siaki, he started wrestling on Raw house shows in February 2007. Florida Championship Wrestling (2007‚Äì2009) After Deep South Wrestling ended their working relationship with WWE, he was transferred to Florida Championship Wrestling, where he continued performing as a developmental talent. P√©rez was subjected to surgery in October 2007, after sustaining an injury on his back, prompting several months of inactivity while in recovery. P√©rez returned to action in January 2008, and continued his participation in the promotion. On January 26, 2008, he participated in a battle royal to determine the number one contender for the FCW Southern Heavyweight Championship. P√©rez won the tournament after eliminating the final contender with the help of Eddie Col√≥n. On February 23, 2008, P√©rez and Col√≥n, collectively known as The Puerto Rican Nightmares, defeated Steven Lewington and Heath Miller in a tournament final to become the first-ever FCW Florida Tag Team Champions. The team lost the titles to Brad Allen and Nick Nemeth on March 23, 2008, before winning them back via disqualification on April 15, 2008. They lost the titles to Drew McIntyre (Drew Galloway) and Stu Sanders (Stuart Bennett) on May 6, 2008. On July 17, P√©rez and Col√≥n reclaimed their titles by defeating McIntyre and Sanders. They later lost the titles to Nic Nemeth and Gavin Spears on August 16, 2008, when Col√≥n was promoted to the main brands. Less than a month later, on September 15, P√©rez performed in a dark match prior to Raw, defeating Gene Snitsky by pinfall. The following week, on September 22, he performed against Tommy Dreamer (Thomas Laughlin), prior to the WWE SmackDown tapings. On December 11, P√©rez won the FCW Florida Heavyweight Championship, defeating Sheamus O'Shaunessy (Stephen Farrelly), Joe Hennig and Drew McIntyre in a fatal four-way match. The following month, FCW's creative team changed his ring name to \\"Eric Escobar\\". During the following months, while still holding the title, P√©rez performed on several dark matches prior to the tapings of WWE's main brands, working under his developmental ring name. On February 17, 2009, he wrestled against Jimmy Wang Yang (James Yun) before SmackDown. A couple of weeks later, P√©rez performed a sketch in Spanish, deeming himself the future talent of WWE, subsequently defeating Kizarny (Nick Cvjetkovich). On February 26, 2009, he was booked to lose the championship against Hennig. He continued working with Yang on subsequent dates, performing jobs on March 17, 2009, prior to SmackDown's 500th episode, the August 3 edition of WWE Superstars and August 4 SmackDown show. P√©rez then entered a feud with Santino Marella (Anthony Carelli) during one of WWE's Latin American tours, trading victories. SmackDown (2009‚Äì2010) As his promotion to the main roster approached, a character based on Jonathan Goldsmith‚Äôs The Most Interesting Man in the World was pitched for P√©rez by writer Jenn Bloodsworth, vignettes for it were recorded but the concept was ultimately abandoned. On September 28, 2009, he performed in his last dark match against Col√≥n, losing by pinfall. The following night, P√©rez made his debut on the main roster under the ring name Eric Escobar. He was placed in an angle with Vickie Guerrero and performing as a villainous character, during the tapings of SmackDown's tenth anniversary show. In his in-ring debut, he defeated Matt Hardy by pinfall, receiving a spot in the brand's team for the first edition of WWE Bragging Rights. In his debut for the WWE Superstars, he was teamed with Drew McIntyre being placed over the tag team of Hardy and R-Truth. On October 23, 2009, Escobar was one of five wrestlers removed from Team SmackDown of Bragging Rights. Escobar was included in his first and only titular contest in WWE on November 27, 2009, losing to John Morrison for the WWE Intercontinental Championship. The angle with Guerrero was ended in a skit that featured a spot where she yelled at him and slapped him in the face, prompting a physical confrontation between both characters, which ultimately ended with Escobar turning into a face character. During his face run, Escobar was punished by Guerrero, who put Escobar in handicap matches against Hart Dynasty (David Hart Smith and Tyson Kidd) and Jeri-Show (Chris Jericho and Big Show). On December 18, Escobar wrestled in his final WWE match, losing to Kane in what was another punishment for Escobar by Guerrero. On January 17, 2010, P√©rez was released from his WWE contract. =Independent circuit (2010-2012)= Consequently, P√©rez returned to the World Wrestling Council on January 30, 2010, working under the ringname \\"Mr. Escobar\\". This character was based on his previous WWE gimmick. He was immediately booked in a feud with Ray Gonz√°lez and Black Pain, forming a tag team with Orlando Col√≥n. After Orlando left the promotion to work in FCW, he was inactive in WWC. During this timeframe, P√©rez worked dates in Florida including his debut in American Combat Wrestling defeating ACW Kombat Champion Kennedy Kendrick. He would later go on to work for Combat Championship Wrestling in Florida. He returned to the World Wrestling Council in their annual event, \\"Camino a la Gloria\\", where he was included in a feud with BJ (Benjam√≠n Jim√©nez). On April 24, 2010, he participated in an inconclusive Three Way Dance to determine the number one contender for the Universal Championship.http://www.superestrellaswwc.com/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=131:wwc&catid;=22:envivo&Itemid;=69 On May 29, 2010, P√©rez was involved in an incident, responding to physical provocation by slapping a member of the audience. Following this event, he remained inactive within the promotion. On December 5, 2010 at Xmas in PR along with Rubio, Per√©z made his return to IWA to attack the IWA World Heavyweight Champion Dennis Rivera to which apply an Sky High. On January 6, 2011 at Histeria Boricua Perez challenged Rivera for the Undisputed World Heavyweight Championship which P√©rez won the championship for first time. Throughout the first three months of 2011, he entered a feud with Tua. The angle came to an end at Juicio Final, where he dropped the championship. P√©rez remained off screen for several months following this show, occasionally posting updates in the IWA's Facebook fan page. In August 2011 he made his final appearance in this run on the promotion, cutting a heel promo criticizing the public. After leaving the IWA due to unspecified monetary differences in the fall of 2011, he joined the Puerto Rico Wrestling Alliance, a regional independent promotion. As Escobar he went on to win the PRWA World Heavyweight Championship on December 17, 2011, defeating Richard Young. In March 2012, P√©rez retained over Michael Tarver. On May 26, 2012, he dropped the championship in a four-way match that also involved Matt Hardy. =World Wrestling League (2013‚Äìpresent)= In January 2013, P√©rez was reintroduced by Hugo Savinovich as \\"Mr. E\\", reforming his team with Rubio and performing as one of the main talents in the World Wrestling League, a promotion based in Puerto Rico. Rebranded with a Latin lover gimmick and now known as \\"Los Mamitos\\", they were given a first feud against Los Mega 10, a team formed by Wrestling Alliance Revolution (Ecuador) and Revolution X-Treme Wrestling (Panama) champions, Panama Jack Daniels 10 and El Mega Star. Their first encounter took place at Idols of Wrestling, concluding in a double disqualification when both team exited the arena and continued brawling. The company's management was responsible for employing the WWL's association with Lucha Libre AAA World Wide to book the team in a four-way match for the AAA World Tag Team Championship at Tripleman√≠a XXI, where they eliminated Jack Evans and Angelico before being eliminated themselves. After the event, Los Mamitos were involved in the first stage of a feud against Los Perros del Mal. Los Mamitos making their entrance in WWL's debut show Next was another four- way elimination contest to crown the first WWL World Tag Team Champions, where they defeated the teams of Eita and Tomahawk, El Hijo de Kato Kung Lee and Vengador Radioactivo, and Heddi Karaoui & Zumbi in a four-way match. Former AAA World Heavyweight Champion Dr. Wagner, Jr. and his son, Hijo de Dr. Wagner, were originally scheduled to be in the match, but failed to attend the event without offering an explanation. On September 6, 2013, Los Mamitos defended their titles by defeating the AAA World Tag Team Champions, The Mexican Powers (Crazy Boy and Joe L√≠der). Two days later, the team lost to Germ√°n Figueroa and Joe \\"Hercules\\" G√≥mez in a three-way that also included The Mexican Powers. However, since P√©rez had his boot in the ropes while the referee counted, WWL General Manager Rico Casanova ruled that the World Tag Team Championship could not change hands. On March 7, 2014, Los Mamitos retained the titles against La Dinast√≠a M√°scaras (Sicodelico, Jr. and Hijo de Dos Caras), when Rubio unmasked Sicodelico, Jr. and employed the distraction to score the pin. The teams met in a rematch two days later, wrestling to a double count-out. On October 18, 2014, at Insurrection, Los Mamitos lost the titles against Thunder and Lightning. While the two promotions were involved in a working agreement, P√©rez made appearances in WWC, where he performed under a mask as a character known as \\"The Alien\\" and was assigned Jos√© Huertas Gonz√°lez as manager. Rubio suffered an injury and while he recovered, P√©rez reverted to his former ringname of Escobar and was involved in an angle where he was portrayed as mentally unstable. On January 6, 2015, P√©rez participated in the creation of heel faction The Gentlemen's Club. Despite being joined by a returning Rubio, the Los Mamitos gimmick was dropped and both reverted to their previous ringnames. The group then entered into a feud with a group known as La Rabia led by Dennis Rivera and won a trios match the following month at Rebeli√≥n En El Sur. On March 21, 2015, Perez participated in the International Cup tournament and defeated Shane Sewell in the final to win the eponymous trophy. Prior to this, he had advanced by defeating a cruiserweight wrestler in the opening round and Roger D√≠az in the semifinal. On August 16, 2015, P√©rez participated in Sin Piedad but did not wrestle, instead attacking IWRG Rey del Ring Ricky Cruz and taking that title with him. Later on the same event, he counseled \\"Wonderful\\" Xander (Alexander Ortiz) and joined the rest of the Gentlemen's Club in a turn against Negr√≠n. At Wrestlefest, Cruz won the first encounter between both by convincing the referee that a foreign object had been used, but P√©rez retained possession of the title. In this event he formed an alliance with Hijo de Dos Caras and recruited Xander for unspecified reasons.

They compete in the Egyptian Premier League, the top tier of the Egyptian football league system. They are one of seven teams to have won the Egyptian Premier League, having won it once, in the 1972‚Äì73 season. The history of Ghazl El Mahalla has witnessed many achievements, most significantly during the era of the golden generation of the club which led the team to reach the finals of the African Cup of Champions Clubs (Later known as CAF Champions League) in 1974, only beaten in the final by CARA Brazzaville from the People's Republic of the Congo. The team also reached the final of the Egypt Cup six times, but did not manage to win any.  History  Ghazl El Mahalla is one of the biggest clubs in the history of Egyptian football. It was founded in 1936 after the establishment of Misr Spinning and Weaving Company in El Mahalla El Kubra as a Egyptian national company under the leadership of the patriotic entrepreneur Talaat Harb. The English experts working at the company at that time used to play football with some of the Egyptian workers at the factory which sprung the establishment of the club. In 1947, Ghazl El Mahalla Stadium was established and the company club began to participate in the Corporations League at that time. Later, Ghazl El Mahalla began to participate in the Egyptian Premier League in the 1956‚Äì57 season. Within years, the club rose through the ranks of Egyptian football and made a name for itself. Due to its presence in a big city like El Mahalla El Kubra, the club began to have fans from the city and the towns surrounding it. So, even though the club was initially formed as a company club, it became one of the most supported clubs in Egypt and its fan base grew to become one of the biggest fan bases in Egyptian football. The team played in the Egyptian Premier League for 46 seasons and contributed a lot throughout its history to the Egypt national football team with talented players that came out of the club's youth system like Wael Gomaa, Mahmoud Fathalla, Ahmed Elmohamady, and Shawky Gharieb who is the current head coach of the Egypt national under-23 football team, as well as other talented players that rose to prominence during their time at the club like Mohamed Abdel Shafy who became one of the legends of fellow Egyptian team Zamalek SC, and Mohamed El-Atrawy who was in the 2001 squad of the Egypt national under-20 football team that achieved third place at the 2001 FIFA World Youth Championship. The history of Ghazl El Mahalla testifies with a lot of achievements, the club won the Egyptian Premier League in the 1972‚Äì73 season under the command of the golden generation of the club and among its legends are Mohammed Al-Siyagi, Abdul Rahim Khalil, Muhammad Amasha, Mahmoud Abdel Dayem, and Abdul Sattar Ali. And, the club reached the final of the African Cup of Champions Clubs (Later known as CAF Champions League) in 1974 but suffered a shocking defeat at the hands of the Congolese club CARA Brazzaville. The club participated in the African Cup of Champions Clubs (Later known as CAF Champions League) the following season in 1975 but was eliminated in the semi-finals, this marked the only two participations of Ghazl El Mahalla in the most prestigious club competition in the African continent, the CAF Champions League. The only other participation of the club in an African competition was in the African Cup Winners' Cup in 2002 where it got eliminated in the quarter-finals. The club was runner-up at the 1975‚Äì76 season of the Egyptian Premier League. And, managed to reach the final of the Egypt Cup six times but fortune did not favor it in any of them and the club was never able to win the Cup. The club was also runner-up at the inaugural Egyptian Super Cup in 2001 participating as Egypt Cup runner-up after Egypt Cup champions Ismaily SC withdrew from the competition. The club participated in the 1995 Arab Cup Winners' Cup, which was held in Tunisia, where it achieved third place. The club also participated in the 2004‚Äì05 Arab Champions League but got eliminated from the group stage after ending up in the fourth spot in Group B of the competition, this marked the only two participations of Ghazl El Mahalla in Arab competitions. Throughout its history, Ghazl El Mahalla has been relegated to the Egyptian Second Division six times. The first time was in the 1960‚Äì61 season when Ghazl El Mahalla was relegated instead of Ittihad Suez due to lack of fair play from Ghazl El Mahalla's side in a match against Tersana SC, but the club managed to get promoted to the top tier again the following season. The fall of the club began in the 1994‚Äì95 season when the club placed twelfth in the Egyptian Premier League, the worst placing the club ended up with in 23 years. Although, it could be argued that the fall of the club began in the season prior to that when the club placed ninth, the worst placing the club ended up with in 15 years. Nonetheless, the following season, 1995‚Äì96, the club got relegated for the second time in its history, but yet again managed to get promoted to the top tier again the following season. Only to get relegated for the third time the following season, 1998‚Äì99, and to yet again manage to get promoted to the top tier again the following season. After that third promotion to the Egyptian Premier League, the performance of the club began to fluctuate over the course of the following nine seasons beginning in the 2000‚Äì01 season and placing anywhere between fourth and twelfth positions. This eventually resulted in the fourth relegation of the club to the Egyptian Second Division in the 2009‚Äì10 season, it took the club three seasons to get promoted back to the Egyptian Premier League in the 2012‚Äì13 season, only for it to get relegated for the fifth time and spend one more season in the Egyptian Second Division before getting promoted once again the following season. The club played its last season of 2015‚Äì16 in the Egyptian Premier League before being relegated to the Egyptian Second Division that season for the sixth time in its history, and to spend its longest consecutive seasons in the second level of Egyptian football having spend four seasons in the Egyptian Second Division before earning promotion. On 13 October 2020, Ghazl El Mahalla, under the leadership of head coach Khaled Eid, earned promotion to the Egyptian Premier League after defeating Olympic Club of Alexandria 2-1, the Alexandrian team scored first only for Mohamed \\"Van Dijk\\" Samy to score the equalizer within minutes and then Mahmoud Salah to score the winning goal for Ghazl El Mahalla, in an away match in the final matchday of the 2019‚Äì20 Egyptian Second Division to top their group (Group C) with 47 points, two points clear of the second-placed team, and officially announce their promotion to the Egyptian Premier League after four harsh years in the Egyptian Second Division. That night, thousands of Ghazl El Mahalla supporters filled the streets of El Mahalla El Kubra in celebration of the promotion of the club and gathered at the entrance to the city awaiting the arrival of the team from Alexandria, at the arrival of the team's bus the players stood above the bus and celebrated with the supporters as a huge parade took place which was decorated by the sounds of drums and the chants of the supporters that expressed their overwhelming happiness, \\"Oh Mahallawi (El Mahalla supporter)\\", \\"Play oh Mahalla\\", \\"Say it again, Say it again, Ghazl El Mahalla is back again\\", \\"Say oh world, Say oh people, Ghazl El Mahalla is back in the Premier\\". The supporters gathered at Ghazl El Mahalla Stadium as well and the celebrations continued all night and up till the next morning.

Musical career After leaving high school, she joined The Davis Sisters in 1955, at the start of their tenure with Herman Lubinsky and Ozzie Cadena's record label Savoy Records of Newark, New Jersey. How she came to sing with one of gospel's famous groups is a typical Golden Age gospel tale. Raised in the Church of God in Christ, she was a soloist in the choir of Faith Temple in New York, pastored by Bishop A.A. Childs (the church would later serve as the site of Malcolm X's last rites). Ruth Davis was attending a broadcast at which Jackie was singing and the rest is gospel history. Jackie Verdell possessed a powerful mezzo-soprano voice, and her performances on records such as \\"Lord Don't Leave Me\\", \\"Following Him\\", and \\"I Don't Know What I'd Do\\" made an impression on the young Aretha Franklin, amongst others. \\"I also considered Jackie Verdell of the Davis Sisters one of the best and most underrated female soul singers of all time\\" said Franklin in her 1999 autobiography Aretha: From These Roots. \\"\\"It was through Jackie that I learned the expression 'Girl, you peed tonight'--meaning you were dynamite. Several nights Jackie sang so hard she literally had a spot or two on her robe from peeing. Singing far too hard, I also peed here and there in the early days; I quickly realized no one should sing that hard.\\" Verdell was second lead for The Davis Sisters between 1955 and 1960, featuring on many of their Savoy recordings. Like Franklin, she left the gospel field in 1960 and began singing pop, her voice having deepened to a contralto and losing the upper register. She signed with Houston-based Peacock Records, releasing three singles between 1961 and 1964. None of them charted, but her own composition, \\"Why Not Give Me A Chance\\", produced by Dinah Washington's former producer Clyde Otis, seems to have attained a small level of popularity, being covered in later years by soul singers O.V. Wright on Peacock's subsidiary Back Beat Records in the late 1960s, and by Ruby Wilson on Malaco Records in the early 1980s. The Davis Sisters' recording session information in Gospel Records 1943 - 1969 suggests that Verdell was absent from the group during 1960 and 1961, returned in 1962 for further recordings on Savoy, was absent again in 1963, and then returned again in 1964 for more recordings on Savoy and RCA Records, apparently departing for good around 1966. Some television appearances with The Davis Sisters and Brother Joe May which were posted to YouTube in 2006 and 2007, and appear to date from 1964. After several years of appearing with the Davis sisters, she relocated to Chicago, and worked closely with the Reverend Jesse Jackson and Operation Push as the featured soloist. She appeared in the film documentary Save The Children; Jesse Jackson's Operation PUSH exposition held in 1972 in Chicago. The film was released on September 18, 1973, by Paramount Pictures. She made her theatrical debut in the Alex Bradford play, Black Nativity and sang in the Broadway bound musical Don't Cry Mary. In 1979, she was nominated for a Grammy Award by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Science for her rendition of \\"Kum by ya\\". This was a high point in her career. When asked about this exciting event she replied \\"even if I don't win, it will be a thrill just to be there.\\" In 1981, she once again recorded with The Davis Sisters, the last album by the group entitled \\"The Storm is Passing Over\\". The album featured Verdell, Audrey Davis, Alfreda Davis, and Michele White. After further unsuccessful pop singles on Decca Records (US) and its Coral Records subsidiary, the late 1960s and early 1970s found her contributing background vocals (along with Cissy Houston, Judy Clay, and other members of The Drinkard Singers or The Sweet Inspirations) to records by Wilson Pickett (\\"Cole, Cooke & Redding\\"), Dee Dee Warwick (\\"Turning Around\\"), Van Morrison (\\"Moondance\\"), Clarence Wheeler & The Enforcers, Horace Silver, and Martha Vel√©z, as well as a further solo single for Stax Records' Gospel Truth and Respect labels under the name of Jacqui Verdell. Her only solo album, Lay My Burden Down, produced by former soul singer Joe Simon, and including Houston & Warwick on background vocals, was released on Spring Records in 1983, and on CD by Ace Records (UK) in 1993. Viv Broughton's 1985 book Black Gospel: An Illustrated History Of The Gospel Sound stated, \\"Whereas Aretha Franklin lives in fabulous, if troubled, luxury - Jackie Verdell, who made the same move at the same time made nothing at all and is now back singing gospel to a faintly suspicious audience\\" (paperback edition, page 107). She once complained to gospel maven Anthony Heilbut: \\"I'd like to be an evangelist, but these crooked promoters won't pay my money\\".

Homovanillic acid is used as a reagent to detect oxidative enzymes, and is associated with dopamine levels in the brain. In psychiatry and neuroscience, brain and cerebrospinal fluid levels of HVA are measured as a marker of metabolic stress caused by 2-deoxy-D-glucose. HVA presence supports a diagnosis of neuroblastoma and malignant pheochromocytoma. Fasting plasma levels of HVA are known to be higher in females than in males. This does not seem to be influenced by adult hormonal changes, as the pattern is retained in the elderly and post-menopausal as well as transgender people according to their genetic sex, both before and during cross-sex hormone administration. Differences in HVA have also been correlated to tobacco usage, with smokers showing significantly lower amounts of plasma HVA.

Known as Anna Bahr- Mildenburg after her 1909 marriage, she had been a prot√©g√© of the composer/conductor Gustav Mahler during his musical directorship at the Hamburg State Opera. In 1898, Mahler took her to the Vienna Opera, where she established herself as one of the great stars during his celebrated tenure there as music director.  Biography  Anna Bellschan von Mildenburg, to give her full maiden name, was born in Vienna, the Austrian capital. She studied voice with Rosa Papier and Johannes Ress at the Conservatory of Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde in Vienna, and then privately with Cosima Wagner and Mahler. She had an affair with the latter which lasted until 1897. Von Mildenburg made her operatic debut in 1895 at Hamburg, singing the role of Br√ºnnhilde in The Ring Cycle under Mahler's baton. Then, in 1897, she performed the role of Kundry in Parsifal at the Bayreuth Festival, and also took on the mezzo-soprano part of Ortrud in Lohengrin. Cosima Wagner, the composer's widow, became her mentor at Bayreuth, and she proceeded to perform all the main Wagnerian soprano parts at the festival prior to the outbreak of World War I in 1914. She first sang at the Vienna Hofoper on 8 December 1897, when she took the role of Br√ºnnhilde in Die Walk√ºre under Hans Richter. Mahler put her on a contract and she soon experienced enormous success. In her first season alone she earned 14,000 gulden (about ‚Ç¨112,000 in 2008). Her stature at the opera house equaled that of Mahler, who was then the establishment's director of music. She would perform at the Vienna State Opera until 1917, and then again in 1919-1920. Among her most celebrated performances during this period was an assumption of Isolde's role in a famous production of Tristan und Isolde mounted under Mahler's leadership. Away from Vienna, von Mildenburg sang to acclaim in London at The Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, performing Isolde and Elizabeth in Tannh√§user there in 1906, as well as Klytemnestra in the first London production of Richard Strauss' Elektra. Her repertoire was not confined, however, to works by Strauss and Wagner. She also appeared in Beethoven's Fidelio, Bellini's Norma, Mozart's Don Giovanni and Weber's Oberon during the course of her career. From 1922 to 1927, von Mildenburg was a guest artist at the Salzburg Festival, appearing in Hugo von Hofmannsthal's stage work Das Salzburger gro√üe Welttheater, among other productions. After retiring from opera, she gave singing lessons in Munich. Among those she instructed in Munich were Lilian Benningsen, Fritz Schaetzler, and the renowned Wagnerian tenor, Lauritz Melchior, who consulted her in 1922. After 1929, she taught voice at the International Mozarteum Summer Academy in Salzburg, but she returned briefly to the stage in 1930 to sing one last Klytemnestra at Augsburg. She eventually retired from teaching because of the exigencies of the Second World War and died in 1947. Together with her husband, the Austrian author, playwright and critic Hermann Bahr, she is buried in a place of honor in the Salzburg Community Cemetery. Her sole recording & histrionic style Only one rare recording by von Mildenburg is known to have survived. It consists of part of the aria \\"Ocean! thou mighty monster\\", sung in German, from Oberon by Carl Maria von Weber. Made in 1904, the recording has been re- issued on CD on the Marston and Symposium labels. It substantiates her reputation as a first-class singer of impressive power and authority, possessing strong high notes and producing a steady emission of rounded tone during the years of her prime. Apparently, she was also a memorable if stylised actress with a strong stage presence. She even published a singers' guide in 1936 on how to act and gesture in Wagner in accordance with what she called the \\"authentic\\" Bayreuth method.

The station primarily served passengers travelling to the Grand Canyon via the Grand Canyon Railway. History The first station at Williams Junction was built by Morrison Knudsen for the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway as part of construction of the ‚ÄòCrookton Cutoff‚Äô: a re-routing of a 44-mile stretch of the Southern Transcon to avoid the sharp curves and steep gradients of the line between Williams and Ash Fork. With the new route bypassing the town of Williams completely, Williams Junction replaced the downtown Williams Depot as the connection point between main line transcontinental services and Santa Fe trains to and from the Grand Canyon (trains 14 and 15). The station officially opened on December 19, 1960. Williams Depot remained open for the Hassayampa Flyer service between Williams Junction and Phoenix via Ash Fork and the Peavine route (trains 42 and 47). Both Williams stations closed in 1969 following the Santa Fe's discontinuation of passenger services to the Grand Canyon and Phoenix via the Peavine. The station building at Williams Junction remained standing for a few years following its closure, but was eventually demolished. The spur from the Southern Transcon and the line through downtown Williams were retained for freight services. Following the successful regeneration of the former Santa Fe line to the Grand Canyon as a privately operated tourist venture in 1989, Amtrak introduced a stop at Williams Junction on their Southwest Chief route to connect with Grand Canyon Railway services. The new station opened on August 2, 1999. Unlike its predecessor, the modern Williams Junction had no station building or facilities, and no private access for motor vehicles. Passengers were transferred to downtown Williams via a Thruway Motorcoach shuttle provided by the Grand Canyon Railway. The collection and drop-off point was the Grand Canyon Railway Hotel adjacent to the refurbished Williams Depot, now the southern terminus of the Grand Canyon line. Closure In 2017, the Grand Canyon Railway announced they would be discontinuing their provision of a shuttle to connect passengers on the Southwest Chief with their hotel in Williams, leaving the long-term viability of Williams Junction unclear. The station closed on January 1, 2018. To accommodate passengers requiring a connection to the Grand Canyon, Amtrak introduced a new Thruway bus service to and from Flagstaff.

It lies adjacent to the A4 national route. The Cocklemore Brook rises near the village. Previously, the Calne branch of Wilts & Berks Canal ran just north of the village; it's due to be restored further south, crossing the village.Wilts & Berks Canal Trust Map: Calne Branch 1 Nearby villages include Derry Hill, Bremhill, Pewsham, Stanley and Tytherton Lucas. History An ancient road between Salisbury and Bristol passed by the village location, and there was probably some early form of settlement. There were certainly Roman and Romano-British settlements in this area; because of the forested nature of the area, settlements have always been scattered. Studley itself is mentioned in 1175 and 1196, and it was closely associated with Stanley Abbey in Bremhill parish, until its dissolution in 1540. Villagers are likely to have used the church at the abbey; since 1540, and until the new parish church was built at Derry Hill in 1840, they had to travel to Bremhill for the church services. A non-conformist chapel was built at the north end of Studley Lane in 1855. There was a manor house in 1240 that was demolished between 1773 and 1800, and replaced by Studley House Farm. The new manor house is from the 18th century. It's possible that a fulling mill existed in the early 13th century at the start of a local cloth industry. One was certainly standing in 1602, and by the middle of the 17th century, Hassell's Mill on the river Marden was replaced by New Mill. This was converted to a corn mill in 1728 and continued working until the mid-20th century, being demolished in 1962. The oldest surviving cottages are of stone and thatch, built in the 17th century. Between 1745 and 1848 there stood the Black Dog Inn, which gave its name to the hill, and later to Black Dog Halt railway station of the Chippenham and Calne Line, at the east end of the village. In 1761 a new pub called the Rose and Crown was opened; renamed the Soho Inn by 1830, it still serves as the village pub. As of October 2016, it is being refurbished and will re-open as The Black Dog Inn. There was further building throughout the 19th century, chiefly along the roads and lanes, and even more houses appeared in the 20th century. Nevertheless, the community has remained scattered, largely agricultural with grassland, arable, and woodland. The houses had no mains drainage, gas, or electricity until after the Second World War.

The drink was included in Difford's Guide's Top 100 Cocktails. A Rusty Nail can be served in an old-fashioned glass on the rocks, neat, or \\"up\\" in a stemmed glass. It is most commonly served over ice. A Rusty Nail served without ice is sometimes called a Straight Up Nail. Variations Versions of the drink can be made using any aged spirit, though blended Scotch whisky is traditional. Other variations include: * The Rusty Bob, which substitutes Bourbon whisky for blended Scotch whisky * The Rusty Ale, in which a shot of Drambuie is added to any beer, served without ice. * The Smoky Nail, which uses Islay whisky (very smoky in flavor) in place of blended Scotch whisky. * The Clavo Ahumado (Spanish for \\"smoky nail\\"), using mezcal instead of blended Scotch whisky. * The Railroad Spike, often served at brunch and made with approximately four parts Cold brewed coffee to one part Drambuie in a tall glass over ice. * The Donald Sutherland, which substitutes Canadian rye whisky for blended Scotch whisky.

Wondrich goes on to note that \\"it took another generation or so for the drink to assume its classic name and form, during which time it tried on several identities. Here it's a D&S...there; a Little Club No. 1 (the Little Club being a rather swank sort of joint on East Fifty-fifth Street much haunted by showbiz types); at USAF Officers' Clubs in Thailand and the Republic of Viet- Nam, it's a Mig-21, while in the upper Midwest it's a Knucklehead.\\" The cocktail authority Dale DeGroff notes, \\"the Rusty Nail is often credited to the clever bartenders at the 21 Club in Manhattan sometime in the early 1960s.\\" The cocktail's name was finally cemented in 1963, when Gina MacKinnon, the chairwoman of the Drambuie Liqueur Company, gave the Rusty Nail her endorsement in The New York Times.

It is about north of Chippenham and south of Malmesbury. The parish church dates in part from the 12th century. The parish includes the hamlets of Clanville (in the southeast) and Lower Stanton St Quintin (on the A429 road, to the northeast). History Farmland and woodland at Stantone were recorded in the Domesday Book survey of 1086. There were 19 households, and estates were held by Glastonbury Abbey and Osbern Giffard. There is a Roman villa site at Stanton Park in the west of the parish, about east of the Fosse Way. The Malmesbury-Chippenham road, crossing the parish from north to south, has been in use since at least 1100. There were two villages from 1223 or earlier: Stanton (on the road between Draycot Cerne and Grittleton, later called Upper Stanton) and Nether Stanton (later Lower Stanton). In the southeast of the parish is a moated site, about 50 metres square, of unknown date. The St Quintin suffix is from the surname of a 13th-century lord of the manor. Later landowners include the des Bouverie baronets, beginning with Sir Edward (d. 1736) and their descendants the Earls of Radnor; the 6th earl, Jacob Pleydell-Bouverie sold most of the manor in 1909 and the holdings were later broken up. The manor house was demolished in 1856. The early population was low, with only 49 poll-tax payers in the parish in 1377. Numbers increased in the 19th century, reaching 346 at the 1851 census before declining to 259 in 1931. The opening of RAF Hullavington in 1937 brought a substantial increase. In 1971 the M4 motorway was built near to the southern boundary of the parish, and the boundary with Kington St Michael parish was later redrawn to follow it. = 18th-century murder = In 1764 two sailors had been paid off from HMS Stag, receiving ¬£28 each. One was William Jacques, the son of Henry Jacques, rector of Leigh Delamere. On their way to Bristol, William Jacques met up with his companion, the black sailor George Hartford. After drinking at the Green Dragon in Malmesbury and other inns, Jacques accused Hartford of stealing his purse after witnessing how free Hartford had become with money. Jacques had earlier lost his purse and they began fighting. They were persuaded to leave the town and continued quarrelling on the road south, after Jacques tried to push Hartford into a mill pond. After they separated in Hullavington, Hartford continued into Stanton Park where he fell asleep at Black Pond. After obtaining food at the village, Jacques caught up with Hartford and beat him around the head with a hedge stake until he was dead and then stole his money. Some boys saw the murder, raised the alarm and Jacques was pursued by a group of villagers. A woodman found Hartford's body and an hour or two later, Jacques was traced through Kington St Michael and was captured at an alehouse in Chippenham, where he was found to have a pocketful of money and was wearing Hartford's handkerchief around his neck. Jacques confessed to the murder and at his trial in Salisbury confessed to three other murders and a robbery of a man of ¬£10 on Hounslow Heath. Sentenced to death, he was hanged on Stanton Common, between Upper and Lower Stanton, a little to the east of Stock Wood at a public execution with people coming from Malmesbury and Chippenham to watch.June Badeni, Wiltshire Forefathers (1982) ASIN: B001OOWCT8  Parish church  St Giles' Church The parish church of St Giles is built in rubble stone and dates from the 12th century. The nave and lower part of the central tower are largely unchanged from that time; the south arcade was added in the early 13th and the nave re-roofed in the 15th. J.H. Hakewill carried out alterations and restoration in 1826 and 1851, and in 1888 C.E. Ponting oversaw the rebuilding of the chancel in ornate Perpendicular style, faced in ashlar. On the outside of the west wall of the nave, below the 1851 window, is a 12th-century carved figure of Christ, seated and with his feet on a dragon. The south porch, rebuilt in the 19th century, reuses a 12th-century inner doorway and an outer doorway of c. 1175, described as exceptional by Historic England, having elaborate stone carving with some details similar to those found at Malmesbury Abbey. The decorated stone font and its plinth are 12th century, and the west arch of the tower also has early carving. The nave has a stained glass window designed by Christopher Whall and made by James Powell and Sons in 1888. The church was recorded as Grade II* listed in 1960. Notable rectors include Frederic Price (cricketer), from 1911 to 1922; who was followed by Gordon Tidy (soldier, author and poet, for a time in charge of the cathedral at Bathurst, New South Wales). In 1967 the benefice was united with that of Grittleton with Leigh Delamere, and in 1976 Hullavington and Norton were added. Today the parish is one of eight covered by the Gauzebrook group ministry. Local government The civil parish elects a parish council. It is in the area of Wiltshire Council unitary authority, which is responsible for all significant local government functions. Amenities There is a village hall and a primary school, which was opened in 1849 and overseen by Lord Radnor and a clergyman.Stanton St Quintin Primary School 150 years anniversary booklet Stanton St. Quintin Quarry and Motorway Cutting is a geological Site of Special Scientific Interest. Military connections The southern part of Hullavington Airfield (formerly RAF Hullavington) is in the parish. Historic England states that several of the station's buildings, such as the Officers' Mess, represent the \\"improved architectural quality characteristic of the air bases developed under the post-1934 expansion of the RAF\\". The village school was greatly enlarged in 1952‚Äì4 to accommodate children of RAF personnel. The school had begun as a barn or cottage in 1838, with financial support from the Earl of Radnor, and had been enlarged in 1849 and 1891. Average attendance was 40 in 1891 but had dropped to 26 by 1938; however, an additional 100 were expected in 1953. The RAF left the airfield in 1993 although it continued to be used by Volunteer Gliding Schools until 1996. The administration and accommodation buildings were transferred to the Army and renamed Buckley Barracks in 2003, and in 2016 the airfield section of the site was sold to technology company Dyson, who converted two hangars for office use.

It is within both the Calne and Calne Without civil parishes, and lies on the A4 road towards Marlborough, which is some to the east. The River Marden flows in a westerly direction to the south of Quemerford, then turns north and passes under the A4 on its way to Calne. A tributary of the Marden, the River's Brook, passes north of Quemerford. History According to etymologists, the name is derived from the Old English Cynemaeres-ford, meaning the ford at the royal (cyne) boundary (maere) or lake (mere). Ekwall notes the early variants of the name include Camerford (1204), Kemerford (1226-1228), Quemerford (1240-1245), Cameresford (1292), and Quemerforde (1294).Eilert Ekwall, The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English place-names (Oxford, 1936), pp. 359 and 296. Earthworks from a medieval rural settlement, including house platforms, are found on a site south of Quemerford Farm. The site is a scheduled ancient monument. The track from the farm continues south to St Peter's church at Blackland (outside Calne parish), which dates from the late 12th century. Later there was no clear nucleus of settlement, with dispersed farmsteads (ten in 1728) east of the Marden. The surname Comerford originated in Quemerford as a toponymic surname by the thirteenth century. Holy Trinity church By the mid-19th century, Quemerford had a population of 635.Samuel Lewis, Topographical Dictionary, iii, p. 602. Holy Trinity church, a chapel of ease for St Mary's, was built in 1852-3, and its churchyard became the graveyard for Calne parish. In 1866-7 a school was built close to the church. From 1940 to 1964, RAF Compton Bassett, a technical training camp with no airfield, was about northeast of Quemerford. Mills The River Marden was long used as a source of power for watermills, with fulling mills recorded in the 16th century. In 1694 the Chivers family had two mills: one just south of the bridge on the London road, later known as Lower Mill or Quemerford Mill; and one about a quarter of a mile upstream, which became Upper Mill or Provender Mill. Lower Mill was rebuilt c. 1790 as a water-powered cloth factory, with a steam engine added in 1815. The cloth industry declined and the mill was converted to a corn mill in 1841, then used for animal feed production from 1949 to c. 1980. It is now in residential use. Upper Mill was used for corn by 1828 and greatly enlarged in 1860. A second mill was built on the same site in 1935 and both were acquired by Rank Hovis McDougall in 1943 and Dalgety & Co in 1982. Milling ceased in 1982 and the newer mill was demolished in 1986; the old mill was converted for use as offices. Today Quemerford today is mostly an Edwardian terrace and a long line of mainly 1930s houses. The school gained additional buildings in the 1960s and became Holy Trinity C of E Academy in 2012. Quemerford has a pub, the Talbot Inn, and a shop with a post office.

Eisenhower severed relations following the Cuban Revolution on January 3, 1961.United States severs diplomatic relations with Cuba History. Relations were subsequently restored by Cuban President Raul Castro and President Barack Obama on July 20, 2015. With the restoration of relations in 2015, the president may nominate an ambassador, though the position has remained vacant since 1960. The embassy is currently run by a Charg√© d'affaires ad interim, Timothy Z√∫√±iga Brown. The Charg√© d'affaires and the embassy staff at large work in the American Embassy on the Malec√≥n in Havana, Cuba. History Cuba was the last major Spanish colony to gain independence, following a lengthy struggle that began in 1868. Jos√© Mart√≠, Cuba's national hero, helped initiate the final push for independence in 1895. In 1898, the United States fought a brief war known as the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, after the USS Maine sank in Havana Harbor on February 15, 1898 due to an explosion of undetermined origin. In December 1898, Spain relinquished control of Cuba to the United States with the Treaty of Paris. On May 20, 1902, the United States granted Cuba its independence but retained the right to intervene to preserve Cuban independence and stability in accordance with the Platt Amendment. In 1902 the US established an embassy in Havana and appointed its first ambassador, Herbert G. Squiers. In 1934, the Platt Amendment was repealed. The United States and Cuba concluded a Treaty of Relations in 1934 which, among other things, continued the 1903 agreements that leased the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base to the United States. In 1959 Fidel Castro's 26th of July Movement overthrew the government of Fulgencio Batista and Batista fled the country on January 1, 1959. Relations between the United States and Cuba deteriorated rapidly as the Cuban government expropriated US properties and developed close ties with the Soviet Union. In October 1960, the US recalled its ambassador to protest Castro's policies. On January 3, 1961 the US withdrew diplomatic recognition of the Cuban government and closed the embassy in Havana. On September 1, 1977 the US established the United States Interests Section in Havana, located in its former embassy and operated under the auspices of the Embassy of Switzerland in Havana. The Interests Section was headed by Chief of Mission rather than an ambassador. Bilateral relations between the two governments resumed on July 20, 2015.

Headquartered in San Francisco, TYLI established its business in the design of long-span bridges and specialty structures. The firm provides a range of planning, design, construction and project management services to the aviation; bridge; facilities; mobility, planning, and management; ports and marine; rail and transit; and surface transportation industries. TYLI operates from more than 50 regional centers across four continents, and employs a professional staff of more than 3,000 engineers, planners, architects and scientists. History 1950s: TYLI was founded on June 1, 1954 by Tung-Yen Lin, a Chinese-American structural engineer recognized worldwide as an innovator in bridge design, engineering, and construction. Lin is credited with standardizing the practical use of prestressed concrete. He is also known for his emphasis on the structural aesthetics aspect of engineering, regardless of a project's economic limitations. 1960s1970s: Lin continued to expand his firm's specialty in prestressed concrete to broader consulting services, with projects that included conventionally reinforced concrete, structural steel, masonry, and timber-framed structures. In 1967, he designed the 18-story shear wall Bank of America building in Managua, Nicaragua. The reinforced concrete tower was one of only two structures left standing after the country's 1972 earthquake. Lin also became known for his design innovations, such as the Rio Colorado Bridge, an upside-down suspension bridge spanning a deep gorge in Costa Rica. In the early '70s, the firm also established offices in Taiwan and Singapore. 1980s: TYLI expanded with new offices in Kuala Lumpur and a merger with Maine-based Hunter-Bellow Associates in the U.S. In 1986, when U.S. President Ronald Reagan presented Lin with the National Medal of Science, he responded by handing the former president a detailed plan for a ‚ÄúIntercontinental Peace Bridge‚Äù connecting Alaska and Siberia across the Bering Strait. In 1989, TYLI was acquired by the Dar Group, an international network of professional service firms located in 45 countries. 1990s: Following the Loma Prieta earthquake in California in late 1989, TYLI helped in the development of advanced techniques, engineering tools, and design standards for bridge assessment, the seismic retrofit of existing structures, and the design of new bridges. The firm also completed several acquisitions, including California-based McDaniel Engineering, Chicago-based BASCOR, Washington State's DGES Consulting Engineering, and New York's DRC Consultants. Additionally, the firm opened a new Asia-Pacific office in Chongqing, China. 2000s: U.S. expansion continued with the acquisition of Miami-based H.J. Ross Associates, Inc., Northern California's CCS Planning and Engineering, multi-location FRA Engineering and Architecture, and Medina Consultants on the East Coast. The acquisitions strengthened the firm's services in the areas of ITS/traffic engineering and transportation engineering through its aviation and rail and transit line of businesses for such projects as Miami International Airport's expansion project. In Asia, TYLI oversaw the design of major bridges in China's fast-growing central region, including the Shibanpo Bridge and the Caiyunba Bridge in Chongqing, and the Second Wujiang Bridge in Fulin. 2010s: TYLI oversaw the design of 25 elevated bridges across Taiwan for the island's new High Speed Rail system and the Hoover Dam Bypass Bridge, which is downstream of the Hoover Dam; the Port Mann Bridge in British Columbia; Canada (2012); the new Eastern Span of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge (2013) and the Champlain Bridge, Montreal (2019-present), also called the Samuel De Champlain Bridge, in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

Early life Pachen Dolma was born around 1933 in Gonjo, Kham, eastern Tibet. She was the only child of Chieftain elder son Pomda Gonor of the Lemdha clan, of the Phomda Tsang line. Pachen took refuge in the Dharma when she was 8 years old and was subsequently initiated into the deity practice of Dorje Phurba, a Nyingma tradition. When she was 17, she discovered her father's plans to marry her off and attempted to run away to Gyalsay Rinpoche's monastery at Tromkhog. However, she returned after a few days of traveling with her father's promise to annul the engagement. The 14th Dalai Lama and the PRC officially signed the Seventeen Point Agreement in 1951. Increasing tensions led her father to train her in the use of firearms and begin organizing militant resistance. For the next few years, Pachen sat in on her father's administrative meetings with local chieftains. In 1954, Pachen and her mother spent 6 months in Gyalsay Rinpoche's monastery, during which she completed Ngondro, or preliminary religious training. She returned at the request of her father, who wanted to officially teach her the duties involved with being the heir to a chieftain. Rebellion By the end of 1956, tens of thousands of armed Khampas had taken to the surrounding hills in armed resistance. When her father died in 1958, she assumed her role as chieftainess of the Lemdha clan. In 1959, she rode at the head of their 600 resistance fighters into the nearby hills. Her clan joined with others from Derge and Lingkha Shipa. After news of eminent Chinese attack, Pachen returned to Lemdha to warn her family and gather their valuables. Their group grew to thousands as families from the towns of Derge, Lingkha Shipa and Markham fled with the ultimate plan of joining Chushi Gangdruk, the principal resistance group centered in Lhasa at the time. After rejoining the earlier Lemdha resistance fighters, Pachen aided in dividing the refugees into smaller, less visible groups, organized and dispatched defensive patrols, and actively engaged in armed warfare. During this migration, her group was aided by CIA paramilitary support. Their camp was attacked by overwhelming Chinese forces in the area around the Pelbar village in Tingri County in late 1959, shortly after they heard of Chushi Gangdruk's defeat. Pachen, her mother, aunt, and grandmother took refuge in a nearby forest. They successfully traveled towards India for the next 25 days, until they were captured by Chinese forces along with around 300 other refugees. Imprisonment Immediately after being captured, Pachen and her family were held in nearby abandoned houses that served as temporary prisons. Over the course of a week, Pachen was interrogated and beaten. Soon after, many of the women, children and elderly people were released (including her mother, aunt, and grandmother), and Pachen was transferred to a 'collection center' in Lhodzong, where she was held for a month. She reported being the only woman held there. After that, Pachen was transferred to a monastery in Chamdo that was being used as a Chinese prison. For the next 10 months, she was regularly questioned, until she was transferred to another part of the monastery known as Deyong Nang, where she was further questioned and was forced to wear leg irons for over a year. She was held there from 1961 to 1963. In 1963, she was moved to Silthog Thang, a prison 'where those...considered guilty of the most serious crimes were sent,' located between the Mekong (known as the Zachu river in Tibet) and Ngomchu river (a tributary of the Mekong). At Silthog Thang, she was sectioned according to gender and level of devotion. She was also held in isolation for 9 months after refusing to denounce her religion and rebuking an officer. After hearing that her mother was living and working in Kongpo and that a number of prisoners were being sent there, Pachen convinced the prison officers to transfer her as well. She spent a year there and was transferred to Drapchi prison, one of the most notorious Chinese prisons, in 1965. She was held there for 11 years. At Drapchi, she reported that prisoners were forced to wear a Chinese uniform and were forbidden to speak Tibetan, pray, or practice Tibetan customs. After Mao Zedong's death, Pachen was transferred to the 5th division of Tramo Dzong in Kongpo Nyingtri. She was released in 1981, after being imprisoned for 21 years. She was 48 years old. Release After her release from prison in January 1981, Pachen went on a pilgrimage. She visited the monasteries of Sera, Drepung, and Ganden, which had all been destroyed in the Cultural Revolution, during her imprisonment. Over the course of the next year, she visited monasteries in Lhokha, Shedra, Drolma Lhakhang, Dhalakhampo, and stayed for eight months in the Samye monastery. There, she learned the Buddhist practice Chud len, or Essence Extraction, and the Ch√∂d practice, before deciding to return to Lhasa to continue support for the cause of Tibetan independence. She advertised and participated in three notable demonstrations before fleeing to India; the September 27 and October 1 demonstrations of 1987 and the March 5 demonstration of 1988. In 1989, she discovered that she was to be arrested again and made plans to escape to Nepal over Mount Kailash. After 25 days, she was airlifted to Dharamshala. Her dream to meet the Dalai Lama came true when she was granted a personal audience soon after her arrival. She settled in the Gaden Choeling Nunnery in Dharamsala, India. Autobiography Ani Pachen's autobiography, Sorrow Mountain: the Journey of a Tibetan Warrior Nun, was published in 2000, and she toured the United States and Europe. In 2001, she visited the United Kingdom at the invitation of the Tibet Society, and led the annual march through central London to commemorate the Lhasa Uprising. Death Ani Pachen died in Dharamsala on February 2, 2002 of heart failure.

It gives its name to the Dauntsey Vale in which it lies and takes its name from Saxon for Dantes- eig, or Dante's island. It is set on slightly higher ground in the flood plain of the upper Bristol Avon. Today, the parish is split by the M4 motorway, with a chain of historic smaller settlements spread either side. Dauntsey Green is north of the motorway, along with Dauntsey Church at the entrance to Dauntsey Park; to the south are Greenman's Lane, Sodom and Dauntsey Lock. Dauntsey Lock is on the former Wilts and Berks Canal (presently being restored), the course of which runs alongside the Bristol-London mainline railway.  History  Malmesbury Abbey was granted an estate at Dauntsey in 850, and the Domesday Book of 1086 recorded a settlement of 26 households. The Brinkworth Brook defined the northern boundary of the parish, and the Avon most of the western; to the south the natural boundary is the ridge which forms the southern limit of the Vale. Dauntsey Park House, north of the church and overlooking the Avon, has a 14th-century core; it was remodelled in the late 17th or early 18th, and again c. 1800\\\\. The house is a Grade II* listed building. To the north, on the road to Little Somerford, are Home Idover Farmhouse (late 18th) and Idover Demesne Farmhouse (early 19th, a remodelling of an earlier building). Sir Henry Danvers left land for a school and almshouse, together with further land to provide an income to maintain the school, in his will of 1645. The school was built c. 1667 and continued in use until the mid 19th century when it was replaced by a National School, built 1864‚Äì66. Descent of the manor =Dauntsey family= Arms of John Dauntsey: Per pale or and argent, 3 bars nebul√©e gules. These arms can be seen on various monuments within the parish church The family which took its name from the manor of Dauntsey is said by MacnamaraMacnamara (1895), p.228 to have originally been called \\"Oldstock\\", which he deduced from its Latinised name Vetus Ceppus in early charters. Ceppus or Cippus signifies in mediaeval Latin \\"stocks\\" in which a felon's legs and feet were locked. =Stradling= The oldest memorial in the church is that of Joan Dauntesey who died c. 1455 and her third husband John DewaleMacnamara, F.N., Memorials of the Danvers Family, 1895, p.233, for corrected spelling of Dewale who predeceased her. Joan was the daughter of Sir John Dauntesey who died in 1413 and it was through her that the Dauntsey Estate went to the Stradling family. Joan was born in about 1394, and when very young became the second wife of the elderly Sir Maurice Russell (d.1416) of Dyrham, Gloucestershire, who had only two daughters by his first wife. Joan produced for him a son and heir Thomas, who however died as a young man in 1431 leaving a pregnant wife named Joan, whose resulting daughter named Margery died at two days old. Thus ended the line of Russell of Dyrham. Joan Dauntsey married again, almost immediately after Russell's death, to Sir John Stradling (d.1435), the second son of the lord of St Donat's Castle in Glamorgan. The marriage was possibly arranged by Russell's son-in-law Sir Gilbert Denys (d.1422) who was from Glamorgan and was related to the Stradlings. Stradling thus obtained a life interest in Joan's dower, consisting of one third of the Russell manors. The marriage was conducted with such haste that the obtaining of the necessary royal licence for a widow of a tenant-in-chief to remarry was overlooked. The couple were fined heavily in 1417 for their transgression, as the following entry in the Patent Rolls dated 8 July 1418 reveals:Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1416‚Äì1422, p.120, 8 July 1418, Waltham > \\"Pardon, for 40 marks paid in the hanaper, to John Stradlyng, chivaler, and > Joan late the wife of Maurice Russell, chivaler, tenant in chief, of their > trespass in intermarrying without licence.\\" Thereupon commenced the Stradling family of Wiltshire. In 1428 a feudal aid was assessed on John Stradling for the manor of Dauntsey in the hundred of Malmesbury. He was then also lord of the manors of Smethcote and Castle Combe. Unexpectedly, during her marriage to Stradling, Joan inherited the entire Dauntsey patrimony, on the early death without progeny of her brother Sir Walter Dauntsey. Sculpted alabaster tombstone of Joan Dauntsey(d.1457) & John Dewale. His shield of arms, of which only a chevron remains visible, is at top right Joan outlived Stradling and married, thirdly, John Dewale, with whom she is buried, as is witnessed by an alabaster slab in front of the high altar in St James's Church, showing the couple life size, he being dressed in full armour. Around the margin of the slab runs a much obliterated inscription: > Hic jacet Johannes Dewale armiger et Domina Johanna uxor eius quondam uxor > Domini Mauricii Russel militis qui quondam Johannes Dewale obiit mense...die > ultimo MCCCC...III. Et prefata Johanna obiit in primo die anno Dom....Quorum > (aiabus p'pcietur ?) Deus. Amen In English: > \\"Here lies John Dewale, esquire, and Dame Joan his wife once wife of Maurice > Russell, knight, which said John Dewale died in the month...on the last day > (of) 14...3. And the aforesaid Joan died on the first day A.D....Of whom > (may God spare their souls?). Amen\\" Above her head are the armorials of Dauntsey, severely worn away, and above Dewale's head is his shield of arms on which only a chevron can now be seen.Macnamara (1895) was in error to state (p.233) that the arms above Dewale were those of Russell, which do not feature a chevron Dauntsey folklore relates that the parish priest named Cuthbert murdered Edward, the last male member of the Stradling family. The murder was caught on the evidence of a kitchen boy who had hidden himself in an oven and was an eyewitness. Cuthbert was said to have starved to death hanging in a cage from a tree in the gardens. =Danvers= Tomb of Sir John Danvers(d.1514) & Anne Stradling(d.1539) Brasses, top of Danvers-Stradling tomb Edward Stradling's sister Anne married Sir John Danvers and so introduced the Danvers family to Dauntsey. To the north of the chancel is the tomb of Sir John and Lady Anne. Above the tomb are fragments of a stained glass window with Sir John and his wife kneeling with their sons and daughters. Anne outlived her husband by 25 years, and had a canopied tomb built for herself on the south wall of the chancel. To the north of the chancel stands the chapel that houses the marble tomb of Henry Danvers, created 1st Earl of Danby by Charles I; on the east end of the tomb is an epitaph written to his stepfather by George Herbert the poet, who stayed some time at Dauntsey Park. On the north wall of the chapel is the Bissett Memorial noting a charitable distribution of coal to the poor. On Henry's death in 1643 the estate passed to his younger brother Sir John, named after his grandfather. His political views differed from his brothers; he sat in judgement on Charles I and with the Restoration was condemned as a regicide; he had died in 1655, and his coffin was to be dug up and destroyed as a traitor, but it was never found. =Mordaunt= As a result, the estate and church were forfeited to the Crown. In 1690 they were granted to the Mordaunt family, whose name is linked with Charles Mordaunt, Earl of Peterborough. The arms of the Earl can be seen above the South door. =Meux= In the 1890s, Sir Henry and Lady Meux occupied the house and Lady Meux left her mark on the church by removing an old stained glass window and replacing it with another in memory of Sir Henry Meux. St James the Great Church St James the Great The parish church of St James the Great, situated on the edge of the village, can be dated back to 1177 when Malmesbury Abbey claimed it; in 1263 it was given to the Lord of Dauntsey Park House. In the 14th century the nave, north and south aisles were added. The bell tower (1620) and northeast chapel (1656) were built for the first Earl of Danby and family. By 1763 it was dedicated to St James the Great. There are many historical features in the church, from dates etched into pews by bored youngsters to the medieval doom board, the prime historical feature ‚Äì one of only five painted wooden tympanums in the country.History of St. James the Great, Dauntsey It is situated above the rood screen with Christ in the centre of the top. The two characters under Jesus are John and Mary the mother of Jesus; these have been painted over in the past by residents of the manor house who had themselves put into the painting. To the right are two figures Adam and Eve being cast out of the Garden of Eden by St Michael wielding his sword. At the bottom left are the dead in their shrouds; some have discarded their shrouds and are on their way to St Peter's gate and the others are headed for the yaws of the Devil, depicted as a firebreathing monster at the bottom right. The painting was designed to put the fear of God into all who looked upon it. This is the third paint scheme of the tympanum. Prior paint schemes did not display the Last Days; rather, they likely reflect the religious attitudes of the local lords. The tower has five bells, of which three are from the 17th century. The First World War memorial window at the east end of the south aisle was designed and made by Kempe and Tower, whose trademark, a black tower above a golden garb or wheatsheaf, can be seen on the bottom left of the window. Doom Board, 14th century, Dauntsey Church The church is a Grade I listed building. The benefice was united with Brinkworth in 1961 and today forms part of the Woodbridge group of churches. Transport The Wilts & Berks Canal was built across the south of the parish c. 1801\\\\. Traffic declined after the railway was built and was minimal by the end of the century; the canal was formally abandoned in 1914. The Great Western Main Line from London to Bristol was built in 1841, following a similar route, to the north of the canal. Dauntsey railway station, opened in 1868 and closed in 1965, was to the north of Dauntsey Lock. It had three platforms: two for the main line and (until 1933) one for the branch line to Malmesbury. The road through Dauntsey Lock, linking Chippenham with Lyneham and Royal Wootton Bassett, was formerly the A420 which was a main route from Bristol to Swindon and Oxford. After the opening of the M4 motorway (completed in 1971) this section was reclassified as the B4069.  Amenities  The primary school amalgamated in 1992 with the school at Brinkworth, to form Brinkworth Earl Danby's CE VC Primary School. The only pub in the parish, the Peterborough Arms at Dauntsey Lock, closed in 2013 and was bought in 2014 by the Wilts & Berks Canal Trust for use as offices and a community centre. The building dates from the early 19th century. Sources *Dictionary of Welsh Biography, Welsh Biography Online, Stradling *Histed, Lucy.

They are members of the Ethiopian Football Federation and play in the top division of Ethiopian football, the Ethiopian Premier League. Founded in 1935, the club was the first in Ethiopia and was established as a symbol of Ethiopian nationalism and resistance against the occupying forces of fascist Italy. History = Establishment = The club was founded on 1935 at Doro Manekia in George Dukas's family house by Ethiopian Ayele Atnash and Greek George Ducas. Established in the Arada (Arada Giorgis) neighborhood of Addis Ababa during Fascist Italy's invasion of Ethiopia, the club quickly became the symbol of Ethiopian nationalism in the midst of Italian occupation. The patriotic struggle of the 1930s left an indelible mark on the club and the Arada neighborhood, defining both for centuries to come. The history of the club is often thought to be heavily influenced by this neighborhood. St George was said to have started with only 2 Tegera Birr, 1 ball, goal posts and a stamp. Often finding it hard to play football on local pitches due to restrictions placed on them by the Arada police, the club had to constantly move from place to place. In one instance the club members tried carrying goal posts to 'Filwehameda' ( presently located next to Custom Authorities Head Office), but were ultimately chased away by authorities. Attempts to play at 'Aroge Kera' on the 'Etege Menen' field were also unsuccessful as unhappy local villagers chased them away. Then they went to 'Belay Zeleke' 'Zebegna Sefer' village, but Arada police came and chased them away once again. Matches were organized against other local teams or groups in the area such as those of the Armenian community of Addis Ababa. However, because the club was short handed in the number of players they had they ended up recruiting others to play. This is how Yidnekachew Tessema came to be a part of the team, he was found on the streets of Addis and was asked to join them for the match. It was said that he was spotted while crossing Berad Mekonnen bridge and since he went to Teferi Mekonnen School where all club members went to school, they were familiar with him. After agreeing to join them, St. George was able to beat the Armenian team 2-0 thanks to two goals by Yidnekachew himself. The club's first jerseys were brown and white, affordable cloth for the cash strapped club at the time. One of the founders, George Ducas, used scrap together money from his parents to support the club. Others in the club would go around knocking at doors singing traditional songs like \\"Hoya Hoye\\" in order to earn money for the club. The customary reward for their singing efforts was bread, not money, but they were able collect this bread in a sacks to sell it in laborers' villages to earn the money. Once the club was able to find some funds they were able to get a New Jersey that implies their unity with the Ethiopian flag colors. They gave the first jersey to the second team and started wearing the new ones until pressure from the occupying police force made them have to hide this New Jersey underneath their clothing. After buying jersey with the money, the club bought food for the players with the rest of the money. The members and players of the club would to eat bread and tea after matches and training sessions. = Connection to the Ethiopian Struggle = When Italian efforts to directly destroy St. George didn't work, they forced the club to change its name and play matches against a club the Italians had created called '6 kilo'. This club was purposely created by Italians to weaken and demoralize St. George. Sponsored by the nearby factory 'Cugnac Alovo', 6 Kilo (also called 'Cenco Maje' to mean July 5), had more money and supplies than St. George. They beat St. George on multiple occasions and St. George also did the same however those matches nearly always ended with beatings by the Arada (Italian) police. The ongoing Guerrilla warfare during this time was of the utmost importance to the club and its members. Knowing this the Italians trying using the club as a propaganda tool for their own administration in order to confuse and entrap the guerilla fighters. The Italians sent a messages to resistance leaders like Ras. Abebe Aregay to \\"come and see the people is in peace\\" inviting him to watch a football match at JanMeda, a popular field in Addis Ababa. Hearing this the guerilla fighters took an Italian General as leverage not trusting the Italians and Ras. Abebe Aregay sent Demissie W/Michael to investigate the situation. Having been warned before hand to peacefully play the match, St. George was picked to play against \\"6 Kilo\\". The game quickly turned into a physical fight after kickoff with spectators often cheering and whistling to encourage the fight rather than the game. Then the game was interrupted and the Italians' plan foiled. In 1941 when Ethiopia was liberated from fascist Italian control and Haile Selassie I had returned, it was us the club supporters along with fellow Addis Ababians that sang the national anthem \\"Ethiopia hoy des Yebelesh\\"(to mean, Rejoice Ethiopia) to welcome him back. An anthem that was written by a huge St. George supporters Yoftahe Nigussie and produced by Captain Nalbadin. = Ethiopian League Football = The first officially recognized version of an Ethiopian football league was established in 1944. Originally five teams representing the various communities of Addis Ababa including St. George (Ethiopian), Fortitudo (Italian), Ararat (Armenian), Olympiakos (Greek) and the British Military Mission in Ethiopia (BMME) contested for the title which was won by the BMME. In 1947, the country's formal national league kicked off with three teams; St. George, Mechale and Ke'ay Bahir. The club remained within the league for twenty-five years before the Derg reorganized the football leagues, and forced all existing clubs to shut down.History of Ethiopian Football (Soccer) (accessed 21 May 2009) In this process the club had its name changed to Addis Ababa Brewery in 1972 only to change it back four years later. The club switched its name back an forth for 19 years until the fall of the Derg in 1991 when the club officially changed its name back to St. George. St. George enjoyed some dominance in the late 60's after which the league went through a period of relative parity in the 70's and 80's. However, during the premier league era no club has been more dominant than St. George S.C., amassing an impressive 14 titles since the start of the era in the 1997-98 season. As of 2017, the club has a combined 29 top division titles which is by far the most in Ethiopian football.  Ownership  The club is owned by the St. George Football Association. It is also financially supported by prominent Saudi Businessman Mohammed Hussein Al Amoudi and Ethiopian businessman Abenet Gebremeskel, who is also chairman of the club. In June 2018 it was announced that the club would sell most of its shares to fans.  Supporters  Saint George have one of the largest fan bases in all of Ethiopian football and are known for their fervent displays during home matches.The team's official fan club has 32,000 registered member and according to studies conducted by the fan club there is an estimated 8 million fans throughout the country and in the Ethiopian diaspora. Often singing the club's anthem and waving yellow and orange checkered flags, the supporters of Saint George provide some of the most festive atmospheres in Ethiopian football. The ultras of the club are known to be involved in hooliganism, which is a very prevalent phenomenon in the Ethiopian football. Clashes with rival support groups are common, especially during derby matches such as in the \\"Sheger Derby\\". In the early days chants supporters of the club used to repeat went as follows: In reference to their early rivals \\"6 kilo\\": ¬´·ã≠·å´·ãà·â± ·äê·â†·à≠ ·â†·â¥·àµ·â≥ ·â†·åã·äï·â£·ç£ ·àò·åà·äï 6 ·ä™·àé ·â∞·à∏·äï·çé ·åà·â£·ç¢¬ª meaning \\"6 kilo, although playing with their legs and kicking players with headers, they always lose\\" In reference to founder Ayele Atnash. ¬´·åç·å•·àù ·ä†·ã≠·äê·âÉ·äê·âÖ·àù ·ã®·â•·à®·âµ ·ã≤·åÇ·äñ·ç£ ·ä•·äï·ã¥·âµ ·äê·àÖ ·ä†·ã®·àà ·ã®·ä†·à´·ã≥ ·â∞·à≠·à≤·äñ?¬ª meaning \\"firm as a metal steal, how are you Ayele Atnash, Arada's Tersino?\\" In reference to outstanding players Elias (who later became a pilot) and Yidnekachew. ¬´·â†·à∞·àõ·ã≠ ·ä§·àç·ã´·àµ ·â†·àù·ãµ·à≠ ·ã≠·ãµ·äê·âÉ·â∏·ãç·ç£ ·àà·àò·â≥·à∞·â¢·ã´·äê·âµ ·ä•·åç·ãú·à≠ ·çà·å†·à´·â∏·ãç·ç¢¬ªmeaning \\"Elias on the sky, Yidnekackew on land, God created them in tribute.\\"  Academy  In 2017, Saint George finished construction on Yidnekahew Tessema Sport Academy, the club's first youth academy, in the city of Bishoftu (Debre Zeyit). The academy is named after Yidnekahew Tessema, a former Saint George and Ethiopian national team player who rose to prominence in African football as CAF president (1972 -1987). The academy, built at a cost of over 60 million ETB, lies on 24,000 hectares of land and is expected to accommodate over 100 youth players at one time. The facilities at the academy include: two football pitches, a cafeteria, a conference center, a game room, dressing rooms,a modern medical center, a gym, and dormitories.  Grounds  Saint George plays its home matches at Addis Ababa Stadium, also known as Yidnekachew Tessema Stadium. Due to it being the largest international standard stadium in the area, the ground is shared with many other Addis Ababa-based clubs including Ethiopian Coffee, Defense, Addis Ababa City, EEPCO, and formerly CBE SA. Since 1999, fee-paying supporters have owned St. George. In November 2007, the club had finished raising funds and would begin construction of a new stadium. Budgeted at 312 million Birr, 80% of the cost would be covered by Sheik Mohammed Al Amoudi with the balance to be contributed by the club's supporters.Muluken Yewondwossen, \\"80 mln Birr stadium for St. George‚Äôs\\", Addis Ababa Capital (accessed 21 May 2009) Honors =Domestic= League *Ethiopian Premier League: 29 ::1950, 1966, 1967, 1968, 1971, 1975, 1985, 1986, 1987, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1999, 2000, 2002, 2003, 2005, 2006, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2012, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 Cups *Ethiopian Cup: 12 ::1952, 1953, 1957, 1973, 1974, 1975, 1977, 1993, 1999, 2009, 2011, 2016 *Ethiopian Super Cup: 16 ::1985, 1986, 1987,1994, 1995, 1996, 1999, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2005, 2006, 2009, 2010, 2015, 2017 Regional *Addis Ababa City Cup: 6 ::2009, 2010, 2011, 2013, 2017, 2019 Performance in CAF competitions *CAF Champions League: 9 appearances ::1997 ‚Äì First Round ::2000 ‚Äì First Round ::2001 ‚Äì First Round ::2003 ‚Äì Preliminary Round ::2004 ‚Äì First Round ::2006 ‚Äì First Round ::2007 ‚Äì First Round ::2010 ‚Äì Preliminary Round ::2011 ‚Äì Preliminary Round ::2013 ‚Äì Preliminary Round ::2015 ‚Äì Preliminary Round ::2016 ‚Äì First Round ::2017 \\\\- Group Stage * African Cup of Champions Clubs: 10 appearances ::1967 ‚Äì Semi-Final ::1968 ‚Äì First Round ::1969 ‚Äì First Round ::1972 ‚Äì Second Round ::1976 ‚Äì First Round ::1986 ‚Äì Second Round ::1991 ‚Äì withdrew in First Round ::1992 ‚Äì Preliminary Round ::1993 ‚Äì Preliminary Round ::1996 ‚Äì Second Round *CAF Confederation Cup: 1 appearance ::2012 ‚Äì First Round *CAF Cup: 1 appearance ::2002 ‚Äì Second Round *CAF Cup Winners' Cup: 3 appearances ::1975 ‚Äì First Round ::1978 ‚Äì Preliminary Round ::1994 ‚Äì Second Round Players =First-team squad= As of 12 January 2020 Club Officials  President: Ato Abinet Gebremeskel Secretary: Neway Beyene Director of Sport: Kasshun Gezaw Team Leader: Tafess Bekele = Coaching and Medical Staff = Head Coach: Srƒëan ≈Ωivojhov Assistant Coach: Zerihun Shengeta Medical Staff: Bekele Zenebe References External links * Latest Ethiopian Football News * Official Web Site Category:Football clubs in Ethiopia Category:Football clubs in Addis Ababa Category:Association football clubs established in 1935 Category:1935 establishments in Ethiopia ","title":"Saint George S.C."},{"id":"6621675","text":"Trans Ethiopia is an Ethiopian football club based in north Mek'ele, Tigray.

The district operates four community colleges: Berkeley City College, Laney College and Merritt College in Oakland, and College of Alameda. From 1968 to 1988, non-contiguous Plumas County was part of the district, and Feather River College was operated by the district. Plumas County and Feather River College are now part of the Feather River Community College District. Although the district is accredited by the Accrediting Commission for Community and Junior Colleges, it was placed on probation in early 2020 for severe financial problems. History Merritt College opened as a general campus in 1954. It had been known as the Merritt School of Business, and along with what is now Laney College, was operated by the Oakland Unified School District as Oakland Junior College. In 1963, the residents of Alameda, Albany, Berkeley, Emeryville, Oakland, and Piedmont voted to form a single community college district. The district began operations under the Peralta name on July 1, 1964. The Peralta name was selected because all of the cities of the district, now a part of the greater Oakland metropolitan region, are located on the original Spanish land grant for Sgt. Lu√≠s Mar√≠a Peralta dating from August 1820. In 1965, a bond issue was passed which established a new downtown Oakland campus building for Laney College (opened in 1970), a new campus for Merritt College (opened in 1971) and the founding of the College of Alameda. Berkeley City College was established in 1974 and operated under the name Vista Community College until 2006, when it began to operate from a permanent site. Feather River College was operated by the Peralta CCD from 1968 to 1988, when Plumas County was de- annexed from the district; it now operates as the flagship campus of its own district.Feather River College: History and Setting The Peralta district is governed by a seven-member Board of Trustees elected by the public within the district boundaries.

A measure/signed measure/complex measure Œº defined on Œ£ is called locally finite if, for every point p of the space X, there is an open neighbourhood Np of p such that the Œº-measure of Np is finite.

He was head of the DC Board of Public Works from 1871 to 1873 and Governor of the District of Columbia from 1873 to 1874. He is known, particularly in Washington, as \\"The Father of Modern Washington.\\" Early life and career Mary Grice Young Born in southwest Washington on January 30, 1835, Shepherd dropped out of school at 13 and took a job as a plumber's assistant. Eventually, he worked his way up to becoming the owner of the plumbing firm. He then invested the profits from that firm in real estate development, which made him a wealthy socialite and influential citizen of the city. (One of his luxurious properties was Shepherd's Row, a set of rowhouses on Connecticut Avenue designed by Adolf Cluss; Cluss would later be the star witness at Shepherd's congressional investigation hearings.) Two days after the Battle of Fort Sumter that initiated the American Civil War, Shepherd and his brother each enlisted in the 3rd Battalion of the District of Columbia volunteers. The term of enlistment at that time was only three months, after which Shepherd was honorably discharged. On January 30, 1861, he was married to Mary Grice Young, with whom he raised seven children.Tindall, William. Standard History of The City of Washington. Knoxville: H.W. Crew & Co., 1914, p. 262-63. Her niece, Marie Grice Young, was the piano teacher of Theodore Roosevelt's children and a Titanic survivor. He was an early member of the Republican Party and a member of the Washington City Councils from 1861 to 1871, during which time he was an important voice for D.C. emancipation, then for suffrage for the freed slaves. Frederick Douglass would later say of him, \\"I want to thank Governor Shepherd for the fair way in which he treated the colored race when he was in a position to help them.\\" City Boss Alexander Robey Shepherd, circa 1864 By 1870, war and mismanagement had caused the finances and infrastructure of the city to deteriorate so badly that the Mayor of Washington, Sayles J. Bowen, had his furniture seized in an attempt to pay the city's debts. Democrats and Republicans were in a rare agreement that a drastic change was needed from Bowen's regime.DC ALMANAC: Little known or suppressed facts about the colonial city of Washington DC A-M As a solution, Shepherd and his allies began agitation for the abolition of the elected governments of Washington City and Georgetown, as well as the appointed justices of the peace for Washington County, to be replaced with a unified territorial government to administer the entire District of Columbia. The Shepherd machine was easily able to sway popular support in favor of that notion. In 1871, Shepherd was able to convince the US Congress to pass a bill that established the territorial government that he desired. The Organic Act of 1871 merged the various governments in the District of Columbia into a single eleven-member legislature, including two representatives for Georgetown and two for the County of Washington, to be presided over by a territorial governor. The legislature and governor would all be appointed by the President. Both frontrunners for the governorship were initially Shepherd, from Washington, and Colonel Jason A. Magruder, from Georgetown; although popular support was behind Shepherd, US President Ulysses S. Grant feared that either appointment would cause a sectional divide that might make governorship of the full district impossible. Thus, Grant's inaugural appointment to the governorship was his friend, the financier Henry D. Cooke, \\"a gentleman of unimpeachable integrity\\"Ames, Mary Clemmer. Ten Years in Washington: Life and Scenes in the National Capital, As a Woman Sees Them. Hartford: A.D. Worthington & Co., 1873, p.78 and secretly a close political ally of Shepherd. Shepherd was appointed vice-chair of the city's five-man Board of Public Works. The most powerful public entity in the District of Columbia, the Board of Public Works was actually an independent entity from the territorial government, reporting directly to Congress, but kept within the territory's sphere of influence by making the governor its chairman. Cooke, however, rarely attended the Board's meetings (probably at Shepherd's urging), allowing Vice-Chair Shepherd to preside. He asserted himself as a leader to such an extent that he often did not bother to consult the other members of the Board before he made decisions and took sweeping action. His abilities as a political operator, according to D.C. journalist Sam Smith, were formidable: : =City improvements= The warworn condition of Washington City in the late 1860s and the early 1870s, when it was little more than a hamlet of dirt roads, wooden sidewalks and open sewers and surrounded by farmland and large country estates, was such that Congress had for several years discussed relocating the seat of the Federal government westward to St. Louis, which would have led to ruin for the District of Columbia.http://www.washingtonlife.com/2007/05/01/the-boss-of-dc/ Evers, Donna. \\"The Boss of DC.\\" Washington Life Magazine, 1 May 2007. Shepherd believed that if the government was to remain in Washington, the city's infrastructure and facilities had to be modernized and revitalized. He filled in the long-dormant Washington Canal and placed of paved roads and sidewalks, of sewers, of gas mains, and of water mains. In 1872, Shepherd was responsible for the demolition of the Northern Liberties Market. Two individuals, a butcher who was still on the premises at the time of the demolition and a young boy who had come with his dog to chase the rats who fled the structure, were killed in the process.Farquhar, Michael. A Treasury of Foolishly Forgotten Americans. Penguin Books Ltd., 2008, p. 145-152. Under his direction, the city also planted 60,000 trees, built the city's first public transportation system in the form of horse-drawn streetcars, installed street lights, and had the railroad companies refit their tracks to fit new citywide grading standards for the District. =Governorship and fall from power= Shepherd later in life In 1873, the Washington writer Mary Clemmer Ames wrote that \\"the majority of people believe that Governor Cooke would retain his position only until the fusion of irritated factions [i.e., whites and blacks; Washington, Georgetown, and Washington County] was effected, and that in the event of his resignation, Mr. Shepherd would be appointed his successor. Whether Governor Cooke retires before the end of his term or not, it is the universal belief that Mr. Shepherd will be the second governor of the District of Columbia.\\"Ames, p.81-82 Sure enough, that September, Cooke resigned as Governor of the District and Shepherd, having befriended Grant, was promoted by the President to the governorship. Once in office, Governor Shepherd engaged in a series of social reforms and campaigns that were progressive even by Radical Republican standards. Ge \\"integrated public schools, supported the vote for women, sought representation for D.C. in Congress and a Federal payment to the city.\\" Generally, however, his gubernatorial term was \\"principally occupied in avoiding embarrassments in the conduct of the District's official business due to the inadequacy of the revenue which had been entailed by the demands for funds to meet the cost of executing street improvements.\\"Tindall, p.263 However, despite the lack of finances, the massive public works project continued and intensified during Shepherd's term as governor of the District of Columbia. Although the Organic Act of 1871 had given the governor power to issue construction bonds in the city to the consternation of white landowners, but Shepherd put it to a referendum to demonstrate his widespread popular support in the city thanks to the black voters, who backed him. However, the cost of the modifications was excessive. Initially, Shepherd had estimated them at a $6.25 million budget, but by 1874, costs had ballooned to $9 million, despite the national Panic of 1873. District residents gathered 1,200 signatures to petition an audit from Congress; when the audit was conducted, the legislature discovered that the city was in arrears by $13 million and declared bankruptcyTouring Hidden Washington, Mark David Richards, June 2001 on its behalf. Shepherd was investigated for financial misappropriation and mishandling, and it was discovered that the project and its funding had been carried to absurd extremes. Shepherd had raised taxes to such a degree that citizens had to sell their own property to pay them. Street grading had been executed such that some homes' front yards were as much as lower than the front door, and others found their homes standing in trenches with the street at the second-floor. In addition, Congress discovered that Shepherd had given preference to neighborhoods and areas of the District in which he or his political cronies held financial interests. Although none of his actions was found to have violated any laws, the territorial government was abolished in favor of a three-member Board of Commissioners, which remained in charge of the District for nearly a century. Although Grant nominated Shepherd to the first Board of Commissioners,http://www.h-net.org/~dclist/graphics/shep1.gif Message from President Grant to the Senate on the nomination of Alexander Shepherd to the SC Board of Commissioners, June 23, 1874. the appointment was rejected by the US Senate on the same day.http://www.h-net.org/~dclist/graphics/shep2.gif Record of the Senate's rejection of Alexander Shepherd's nomination, June 23, 1874. The appointment of Shepherd became one of the many corruption scandals surrounding Grant's administration.http://www.presidentprofiles.com/Grant- Eisenhower/Ulysses-S-Grant-The-scandals.html The civic improvements, however, had sufficiently modernized the city that relocation of the capital was never again discussed as a serious option. It also created a decades-long real estate boom in Washington (until about the turn of the 20th century), with wealthy Americans coming from all over the United States to build large and expensive mansions, some for year-round residency and some for winter vacation only (leading Washington to be called \\"the winter Newport\\").James M. Goode, Capitol Losses: A Cultural History of Washington's Destroyed Buildings, Washington: Smithsonian Institution (2003). Last years Shepherd during his years in Batopilas, Mexico Shepherd remained in Washington for a further two years, still a real-estate magnate and a celebrated and influential member of Washington society. In 1876, however, he declared personal bankruptcy and, once his accounts were settled, moved with his family to Batopilas, Mexico, where he made a fortune in silver mining and instituted many of the same reforms he had championed in the District of Columbia. He died in Batopilas in Mexico on September 12, 1902, from complications of a surgery to remove his appendix. His body was returned to Washington and buried in a large personal (not family) vault in Rock Creek Cemetery.Find a Grave ‚Äì Memorial # 2198 ‚Äì Plot: Section K, Loc. 21 https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/2198/alexander- robey-shepherd Shepherd's tomb Legacy Shepherd's legacy has been a matter of some debate since his death more than one hundred years ago. He has long been maligned as a corrupt, cronyist political boss, often compared to Boss Tweed, the leader of the Tammany Hall political machine of the same time period. A statue of Shepherd currently stands on Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, in front of the John A. Wilson Building, which now houses the offices and chambers of the Council and the Mayor of the District of Columbia), and has served as a symbol of his fluctuating reputation. Alexander Robey Shepherd In 1979, during the first year of Mayor Marion Barry's administration, the statue was removed from its perch on Pennsylvania Avenue and warehoused in city storage. It reappeared in the mid-1980s near an otherwise-obscure D.C. Public Works building on Shepherd Avenue, S.W., in the District's remote Blue Plains neighborhood. Near the beginning of the 21st century, Washington historian Nelson Rimensnyder started to argue for a restoration of Shepherd's reputation, calling him an \\"urban visionary\\" who single-handedly transformed Washington into a major American city and championed aggressive social reform. Largely as a result of the efforts of Rimensnyder and those he persuaded, the Shepherd statue was returned in January 2005 to its previous place of honor.\\"Rimensnyder Asks for New Respect for Washington‚Äôs \\"Boss\\" Shepherd\\" in \\"Lecture Series\\" page of official website of The Ruth Ann Overbeck Capitol Hill History Project, Washington, D.C.

Fairweather is creator and executive producer; Berry is producer and director.  Premise  The Diego Family (comprising the grandmother Tomasa, Margaret, her \\"sister\\" Lisani, and her son Randy) is a seemingly normal Belizean family.

The following are short summaries of each character; for more on their respective roles in the show, see the show's article. Tomasa Diego Tomasa (played by Carrie Fairweather) is the matriarch of the family. She is the voice of reason and often mediates conflicts between Margaret and her children, in addition to being a confidant to Margaret. She is quiet, wise and dignified as befits her character. Early in season 3, she visits relatives in the southern town of Punta Gorda, where she helps to quell a domestic violence situation threatening to explode, before returning to Belize City as of the fifth episode. Margaret Diego Margaret (played by Sherlette Lopez), otherwise known as Mags or Maggie, is mother to Randy and Lisani and the daughter of Tomasa. She is struggling to expand her business while at the same time dealing with the return of the men in her life, Steve Castillo and Clifford Rowland. She is strong, opinionated, dedicated, fiery and protective, as seen in season 3 in her dismissal of Rowland and dealings with Randy following the latter's run-in with troublemakers. Randy Diego The volatile sixteen-year-old (played by Kerret Paulino) attends high school in Belize City and aspires to become a rapper. He has secured the mentorship of neighbour Dan Man and has had at least two records played on national radio. His troubles stem from the fact that he does not know his father until he meets Minister Clifford Rowland in the middle of season 1. When he finds this out he becomes even more determined to be his own man. But early in season 3, after a run-in with escapees Juni and Luga, he seeks out his father's protection, signaling a possible change of heart. Lisani Diego The industrious 18-year-old (played by Shackera Samuels) attends a tertiary level institution in Belize City and works part-time at a hairdresser's for extra money. The shock of meeting her father (Steve Castillo) in season 1 causes her to briefly rebel, but she returns to the fold just as quickly. She eventually normalizes her relationship with Castillo, only to run into more difficulties when one of her coworkers announces she is pregnant for him. This situation remains unresolved as of season 2. Early in season 3, Lisani receives a scholarship to attend Howard University in Washington, D.C. (coincidentally the home of series director Steven Berry).  Theme and musical score  The score and theme to \\"Noh Matta Wat\\" reflects dramatic origins. The theme was written by Steve T. Berry, music by Oscar Herrera and performed by Dan Man and Dynamo. The score and music for both seasons of the show has been composed by artists including Berry and Adele Ramos, as well as Shawn Tewes, Soundtrack and Enigma. = Opening, commercial and closing credits =  Season 1  Each episode opens with the character of Granny Tomasa (Carrie Fairweather) taking a walk with a young boy, presumably from the neighbourhood, where they discuss aspects of the country's history as it relates to the series. After the last scene, cut to Garifuna drums being played as the theme music begins. A series of clips is shown for each of the characters Tomasa, Margaret, Randy, Lisani, Rosanna and Dan Man (in that order) before the camera freezes one clip and reveals that particular character's name in white. Another sequence is shown featuring the credits for the writer, director, producer and executive producer (over other show clips in yellow) before fading to black as the theme song ends. =Commercials= A brown title card with face shots of all the main characters side by side appears as a male announcer says, \\"This segment of Noh Matta Wat is brought to you by...\\", followed by fade to commercials. No introduction is used coming back from commercials. The last segment usually features a dramatic moment followed by freeze frames of various characters; then the theme music plays as the end credits crawl up the screen on the right side: cast, crew, locations, sponsors. With the exception of episodes 3 and 4, the theme music accompanies the closing credits. In episodes 3 and 4, the closing song \\"Daddy Come Find Me\\" was written by Adele Ramos Daly and performed by Kerret Paulino and Dan Man.  Season 2  The opening credits now feature a highlight reel from the previous episode. The theme music plays after a camera swings back to the audience to reveal the show's name. Clip series is the same, except blue is used instead of brown, and the real names of the actors are added in italics above the character name. Clip sequences have been added for Kent Clare's Clifford and removed for Curtis Gillett's Steve. Commercials: A shot of the Diegos' house on Amara Avenue is shown, covered in blue with the show logo on the lower left, as a male announcer (who also introduces the highlight reel) says: \\"This segment of Noh Matta Wat is brought to you by...\\", followed by a female announcer reading the list of sponsors (she also announces the acknowledgment of season 2's corporate sponsors, Grace Kennedy (Belize) Ltd. and BTL). The same clip is shown on return from commercials, with a different male announcer shouting, \\"NOH MATTA WAT!\\" (He also shouts this phrase at the freezeframe section of the show and at the start). Closing credits remain the same. Note: this has been edited in subsequent airings.  Season 3  Unknown.  Writing and direction  Noh Matta Wat! storylines and scriptwriting were scripted by media and film veterans Adele Ramos (a staff writer and senior editor at the Amandala newspaper) in season 1, and Kimberley Vasquez (Belizean stage and screenwriter) in seasons 1,2 and 3. Steve T. Berry returned in season 2 to direct the first two episodes, while James E. Cheek took the helm to direct episode 3 and the final episodes 6, 7 and 8. In addition, Kelley Chatman directed episode 4 and Eric Berry directed episode 5. The DVD release of season 2 has been re-edited by Steve T. Berry so that the original sequencing of scenes has been rearranged. To add further confusion as to who directed what the existing credits on the first release of season 2 DVDs contains several errors. For instance, the reedited version of episode 2 now contains several scenes directed by James E. Cheek without mention of him as director in the credits and episode 3 has Kelley Chatman's name as sole director in the opening credits when in fact the episode contains scenes directed by both Ms. Chatman and Eric Berry. But the most glaring error is the opening credit given to Eric Berry as the director of episodes 6, 7 and 8 when in fact the re- edited versions contain scenes mostly directed by James E. Cheek and a few scenes directed by producer Denvor Fairweather.  Sponsors  For the past two seasons, Noh Matta Wat! has been sponsored by Belize business houses. As of Season 2, 13 Productions (the distributor of the show as well as its creator) solicited some corporate sponsorship. A full list of sponsors may be seen in the show's closing credits as well as on its website. Unlike other programs, Noh Matta Wat!'s sponsor commercials are embedded in the telecast, added during post-production.  Season overviews  The pilot episode of Noh Matta Wat! aired November 28, 2005. To date, nineteen episodes of the program have aired, five in season 1, nine in season 2, and five in season 3. = Season 1 =  Introduction to the Diego family  In Season 1, we are introduced to The Diego family. The family, of Garifuna descent, is a seemingly normal Belizean family. There is grandmother Tomasa Diego, her granddaughters Margaret and Lisani and Margaret's son Randy Diego. Margaret loves her son and sister. But she tends to believe the best in people, a belief that seems to do her more harm than good. Lisani, an independent but slightly naive girl, is studying and working part-time to furnish a better lifestyle for the family. Meanwhile, Randy dreams of becoming a performer and artist. He works with neighbour Dan Man, an established Creole entertainer who sees Randy's talent and nurtures it as best he can. Dan Man represents a sort of father-figure to Randy.  The Steve Castillo problem  Lisani and her best friend Rosanna Ramirez, a wayward Spaniard with a penchant for excess, are picked up by the American expatriate Steve Castillo. Castillo, himself a flirt, finds it easy to converse with both young women, and has little idea that Lisani is the child whom he abandoned in youth to follow his own life. Margaret, who had never told Lisani the truth about Castillo, is now forced to tell her and, in so doing, endure her hatred for a time. Steve, who vows in one of the scene in the last episode to be there for Lisani, is later accosted by thugs Juni and Luga, shot and forced to flee Belize.  Introduction to Clifford Rowland  Randy, stressed about not knowing who his own father is, records the single \\"Daddy, Come Find Me\\". In an irony of fate, Randy and the street hoods Juni and Luga and the erstwhile drug dealer Ray Phillips were hanging out when the latter trio shot and killed a rival. Randy is framed for the murder, and in jail, finds out that the man who will defend him, Clifford Rowland, is his father and a minister of Government and that he and Lisani are in fact half-brother & sister. In the end, the family has been thoroughly tested in and redeemed by their love for each other. = Season 2 = In preparation for the 2nd season, producers focused not only on the Diegos but also these subplots: the Ramirez family and their problems, Rowland's unrepentant corruption and womanizing, his intrusion into Randy's life, the relationship between Dan Man and Margaret, and Lisani's coworker apparently being pregnant with the child of Lisani's erstwhile father, Steve. A media campaign was launched beginning with the reruns in syndication of the first season, the announcement of a motion picture adaptation, and the release of the first season on DVD. The second season \\"premiere party\\" was held on June 15, 2006 at the Bliss Center for the Performing Arts in Belize City and featured sneak previewshttp://www.7newsbelize.com/archive/06130607.html of the first two episodes of the second season. It also marked the first appearance as main cast members for Kent Clare (Clifford Rowland) and Hershabeth Ramclam (Rosanna Ramirez). The second season premiered on Channel 5 on July 3, 2006. It begins with Tomasa \\"gossiping\\" with Ms. Sarita, a friend and customer, about her family's happenings, particularly about the return of Clifford Rowland, who is now trying to be more involved in Randy and Margaret's life.  Clifford Rowland  Rowland's politics is more corrupt than viewers had ever seen in Season 1, as he was trying to broker a deal with his friend and Ministry partner, Jack, who tells him (in Creole),\\"it wa be sweet fu me, and fi you.\\" A second subplot features doings in Clifford's office as his sneaky secretary Shanice (portrayed by Elizabeth Villanueva) causes trouble and aide Preston (portrayed by both Denver Fairweather and Ansel West) is secretly selling him out; Randy is already predisposed in his mind against Clifford, and he makes little effort to get to know him. Margaret, on the other hand, insists to Tomasa and Randy that \\"Clifford will be in this family whether you like it or not.\\" Tomasa, in her anger at this, abruptly leaves and doesn't speak to Margaret for a couple of days. When Rowland comes over to supper with the family, Tomasa, Randy and perhaps Dan Man, treat him as a nuisance. Rowland does not approve of Dan Man's role in Randy's life and says as much, then offers to pay for Randy's music career. Randy throws a tantrum, dismissing Rowland and refers to Dan Man as his father-figure. Margaret is angered and later apologizes to Tomasa, citing that she only wished Rowland and Randy to be close. He later cuts a song introduced to the world by DJ Kenny Morgan of WAVE Radio, in which he castigates politicians in general and Rowland in particular.  Lisani and Sharlene  Meanwhile, Lisani's coworker Sharlene confides to her boss, Dawn, that she may be pregnant for Steve, who had fled after the ambush in season 1. She hopes to find him and convince him to help her raise the baby. But Dawn, knowing of Sharlene's schemes, convinces her to tell Lisani, who nearly found out after she left her purse in the shop and returns to retrieve it. Sharlene contrives to seek help from Tomasa, who resolves not to tell her granddaughter; this is part of her plan to seek monetary compensation from Steve so she can leave Belize for good. Eventually, Sharlene seems to drop the subject.  The Ramirez family  A third subplot involves the viewer's formal introduction to the Ramirezes: Agnes, Ramon, Vanessa and Rosanna. They serve as a counterpoint to the Diego family's dysfunction, at least outwardly. Their secret problem is Rosanna's obsession with romance, which hurts her in school. In the fifth episode, after Lisani leaves her with a friend to do homework, Rosanna is forcibly raped. This crystallizes her memories of being molested as a child, and she resolves to find her torturer and make him pay. She leaves for Corozal, where she finds out that the man in question is dead; her family resolves to get her help. In episode eight, a newscaster reports that Steve Castillo's attackers are on the run. The last episode ends with the Diegos celebrating the opening of Margaret's new restaurant.  Issues in Noh Matta Wat!  = Politics = In season 2, viewers are introduced to the changed nature of politics in Belize. The following is presented in context to the series.  New party: the NFP  A new party, the NFP (viewers are not told what the name stands for), has taken power in Belize, replacing the traditional People's United Party and United Democratic Party. No information is given on its membership, policies, or platform. The party is represented on the show by Minister Clifford Rowland, though other members are briefly mentioned. Rowland first appears in episode three of season one, when Margaret Diego appeals to him to rescue her son Randy from jail. He is then in the midst of a scandal over funds to build a local hospital. In season two, Rowland continues his shady ways while conducting an affair with his secretary. Unfortunately for Rowland, aide Preston (played by first Denvor Fairweather and later Ansel West) is secretly selling him out to the local media and Belizeans dislike the NFP even more than they did the PUP or UDP (at least according to the characters). At the end of season two Rowland's marriage is in shambles and his political career is under threat.  Relation to series  The NFP presumably represents the creators' view of the current political stalwarts, the PUP and UDP. Belizeans typically feel that neither party is able or willing to rid itself of underhandedness in political operations and fly-by-night tactics, and this is reflected in the characters' reaction to Rowland in the series. The real parties appear to have no qualms with the series; on Independence Day 2006 Leader of the Opposition Dean Barrow acknowledged the series in his address and Prime Minister Said Musa followed suit.http://www.7newsbelize.com/archive/09220606.html  On television  = Season 1 = Season One covered five episodes aired from November 28-December 25, 2005. Channel 5 aired the premiere each week following local news at 7:15 PM, repeated on Saturdays at eight; Channel 7 aired it on Tuesdays following news and Sundays at 7:00 PM; and Krem Television aired the program at 9:00 PM on Thursdays and 3:00 PM on Fridays. Occasionally, Five and Seven would move the program to 9:00 PM to accommodate their respective news blocks. The series returned in syndication during March and April 2006. = Season 2 = Airtimes were the same as in season 1. The eighth episode experienced technical difficulties with audio. Thus, 13 Productions and the broadcasters decided to re-edit the 8th episode by combining it with the season finale into a full hour mini-feature due to air the following week. As planned, the newly edited 8th episode and the season finale aired on all three broadcast outlets the ninth and final week. Reruns aired from October 2006 to January 2007 and from July 17 to September 9, 2007 on Channel 7 and Krem Television in anticipation of the third season (Channel 5 experienced conflict due to the equally popular Karaoke Television, entering its sixth season). = Season 3 = Reports on the home website in March 2007 indicate that producers were facing serious competition from bootlegged editions of both seasons one and two and that 13 Productions is tangled in a legal battle with bootleggers in Los Angeles in particular, which briefly put a third season in jeopardy. March Website report The site also reports that authentic Season 2 DVDs have gone on sale as of August 5, 2007 in Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, New York City and Miami as well as Belize.

They should not be identified with vocational schools, whose goal is to deliver skills for a particular type of job. Soviet Union and post-Soviet states Of the specialized school in the Soviet Union (, Shkola s uklonom) there were three typical types: physical/mathematical schools, with enhanced education in physics and mathematics, sports school, and schools with advanced study of a foreign language of choice. This tradition continued in a number of post- Soviet states, notably Russia, Kyrgyzstan and Belarus, with many schools renamed into liceums. There also were schools with musical education, but they were in their own category and called \\"secondary musical school\\". In secondary musical schools, the primary goal was musical education since the 1st grade (i.e., they may be classified as vocational schools), with obligatory general secondary education provided in a somewhat truncated form. (Note: In the terminology of the Soviet Union, the \\"secondary school\\" included primary education as well, i.e., it encompassed grades 1-10.) Foreign language schools started study of a particular foreign language since the 1st grade (in regular Soviet schools foreign language was introduced in the 5th grade) and, since some grade (commonly the 5th) some subjects were delivered in this language. Language schools specialized in English, German, French, and Spanish languages, with English schools being most common in late Soviet Union and Spanish least common. Physmath schools (physical/mathematical schools) delivered enhanced education in physics and mathematics. Most commonly, this enhancement started at higher grades, typically starting at 8th or 9th grades. A fact of note was a very high percentage of Jewish students in physmath schools. There was no informal quota for Jews in specialized schools, unlike some prestigious universities and research institutions.Kerosinka: An Episode in the History of Soviet Mathematics There are three categories of sports schools: *Children and Youth Sports School (USSR, –î–µ—Ç—Å–∫–æ-—é–Ω–æ—à–µ—Å–∫–∏–µ —Å–ø–æ—Ä—Ç–∏–≤–Ω—ã–µ —à–∫–æ–ª—ã, –î–Æ–°–®).

The phrase may refer to someone born in the United Kingdom of Italian descent, someone who has emigrated from Italy to the United Kingdom or someone born elsewhere (e.g. the United States), who is of Italian descent and has migrated to the UK. More specific terms used to describe Italians in the United Kingdom include: Italian English, Italian Scots, and Italian Welsh. History =Roman Britain= The Romans from Italy were the first Italians to settle in the British Isles along with other people from various parts of the Roman Empire. They came as far back as 55 and 54 BC when Julius Caesar (initially landing in Deal) led expeditionary campaigns in the south-east of England, and then again in AD 43 when Emperor Claudius invaded and subsequently conquered the British islands. Historian Theodore Mommsen calculated that in the five centuries of Roman presence in the British isles, more than 50,000 Roman soldiers (mainly from The Balkans) moved to live permanently in Roman Britain. =Middle Ages= Lombard Street, London Continuous contact with Rome and the Catholic world was initially restricted to the Celtic Christian, Brittonic-speaking portions of Britain where trading activities continued with the Mediterranean and Italy continuing into the seventh century as non-Christian Anglo-Saxon kingdoms began to coalesce into England. Initially the stable Anglo-British kingdoms of Wessex and then Northumbria followed the practices of Celtic Christianity however powerful figures such as Alfred the Great, who had been anointed by the Pope in Rome, tended toward Roman Catholicism especially after the Synod of Whitby drawing merchants, men of culture, artisans and educated Catholic clerics from the Latin West including Italy. After the conquest of Anglo-Saxon England in 1066, the first recorded Italian communities in England began from the merchants and sailors living in Southampton. The famous \\"Lombard Street\\" in London took its name from the small but powerful community from northern Italy, living there as bankers and merchants after the year 1000. Medieval Italian craftsmanship at Westminster Abbey The rebuilding of Westminster Abbey showed significant Italian artistic influence in the construction of the so-called 'Cosmati' Pavement completed in 1245 and a unique example of the style unknown outside of Italy, the work of highly skilled team of Italian craftsmen led by a Roman named Ordoricus. In 1303, Edward I negotiated an agreement with the Lombard merchant community that secured custom duties and certain rights and privileges. The revenues from the customs duty were handled by the Riccardi, a group of bankers from Lucca in Italy. This was in return for their service as money lenders to the crown, which helped finance the Welsh Wars. When the war with France broke out, the French king confiscated the Riccardi's assets, and the bank went bankrupt. After this, the Frescobaldi of Florence took over the role as money lenders to the English crown. As bankers, the Frescobaldi financed ventures for numerous members of European royal families, notably their financial conquest of England, which Fernand Braudel has signalled as the greatest achievement of the Florentine firms, \\"not only in holding the purse-strings of the kings of England, but also in controlling sales of English wool which was vital to continental workshops and in particular to the Arte della Lana of Florence.\\" =15th to 18th centuries= According to historian Michael Wayatt, there was \\"a small but influential community\\" of Italians \\"that took shape in England in the 15th century initially consisting of ecclesiastics, renaissance humanists, merchants, bankers, and artists.\\" Giovanni Cabot (in the middle of two friends) in London Historian Alwyn Ruddock claimed to have found evidence that the navigator Giovanni Caboto ('John Cabot') who discovered North America in 1497 {received backing from the Italian community in London for his voyage to North America. In particular, she suggested he found a patron in the form of Fr. Giovanni Antonio de Carbonariis, an Augustinian friar who was also the deputy to the papal tax collector Adriano Castellesi. Ruddock suggested that it was Carbonariis, who certainly accompanied Cabot's 1498 expedition and who was on good terms with the King, who introduced the explorer to Henry VII for the discovery expedition. Beyond this, Ruddock claimed that Cabot received a loan from an Italian banking house in London 'to go and discover new lands'. In the aftermath of the English Reformation, amongst other religious refugees from the European continent, many Italian Protestants found Tudor England to be a hospitable haven, and brought with them cultural Italian ties. The fifteenth century also saw the birth of a pivotal Italo-Englishman in the form of John Florio, a famed language teacher, lexicographer, and translator. The Titus family is another significant group that settled in England in the time of the Renaissance. The arts flourished under the Hanoverian dynasty and this attracted many more Italian artisans, artists and musicians to Britain. All of this developed in the United Kingdom a moderate Italophilia during the late Italian Renaissance. For example, in the 1790s many Italians with skills of instrument making and glass blowing came over from Italy, France and Holland to make and sell barometers. By 1840 they dominated the industry in England. =From Napoleon to World War I= The Napoleonic wars left northern Italy with a destroyed agriculture and consequently many farmers were forced to emigrate: a few thousand moved to the British isles in the first half of the nineteenth century. St Peter's Italian Church in London Giuseppe Mazzini lived in London for some years and promoted the construction of the Italian church of St. Peter in the \\"Little Italy\\" of Clerkenwell (a London neighbourhood) The Italian-style basilica was inaugurated in 1863 and was the main place of reunion for the growing Italian community of London. The Risorgimento hero Mazzini also created an Italian school for poor people, active from November 1841 at Greville Street in London. By the time WWI started, the Italian community was well established in London and other areas of the British isles (there were nearly 20,000 Italians in the United Kingdom in 1915). =Second World War= When Second World War came the Italians in Great Britain had built a respected community for themselves. But the announcement of Benito Mussolini's decision to side with Adolf Hitler's Germany in 1940 had a devastating effect. By order of parliament all aliens were to be interned. Although there were few active fascists, the majority had lived in the country peacefully for many years, and had even fought side by side with British-born soldiers during the First World War. Some had married British women and even taken British citizenship. This anti-Italian feeling led to a night of nationwide riots against the Italian communities on 11 June 1940. The Italians were now seen as a national security threat linked to the feared British Union of Fascists, and Winston Churchill told the police to \\"collar the lot!\\" Thousands of Italian men between the ages of 17 and 60 were arrested after his speech. They were transported to camps across the country. In one of these transportations a tragedy occurred: the sinking of the ocean liner on 2 July 1940 resulted in the loss of over 700 lives, including 446 British-Italians being deported as undesirable. Italians comprised almost half of the ship's 1564 passengers; the rest were British soldiers, and Jewish refugees. Sailing for Canada from Liverpool, the unescorted Arandora Star was torpedoed by the and sank within 30 minutes. One historian describes it as the \\"most tragic event in the history of the [British] Italian community... no other Italian community in the world has suffered such a blow.\\" On 19 July the Home Secretary, wrote a letter to Lord Halifax, the Foreign Secretary, in which he made it clear that he realised mistakes had been made in selecting Italians for the Arandora Star.Foreign Office File FO 916 2581 folio 548 Lord Snell was charged with conducting a government inquiry into the tragedy. He recognised that the method of selecting dangerous Italians was not satisfactory and the result was that among those earmarked for deportation were a number of non- fascists and people whose sympathies lay with Britain.Foreign Office File FO 371 25210 =Since 1945= \\"Little Italy\\" in Clerkenwell (London) In the 1950s Italian immigration started again to some areas of Great Britain (such as Manchester), even if relatively limited in number. It was made mainly from Lazio. But in the 1960s it tapered off and practically stopped in the 1970s. The region of the country containing the most Italian Britons is London, where over 50,000 people of Italian birth live. Then there are Manchester, where 25,000 Italians live and Bedford, where there are approximately 20,000 people of Italian origin. Bedford has a high concentration of Italian immigrants, along with Peterborough. This is mainly as a result of labour recruitment in the 1950s by the London Brick Company in the southern Italian regions of Puglia and Campania. By 1960, approximately 7,500 Italian men were employed by London Brick in Bedford and a further 3,000 in Peterborough. In 1962, the Scalabrini Fathers, who first arrived in Peterborough in 1956, purchased an old school and converted it into a church named after the patron saint of workers San Giuseppe.

These branches operate in a manner similar to that of the federal government of the United States. Oregon also has a system of commissions, wherein private citizens are appointed by the governor and confirmed by the Senate; these commissions have the authority to hire and fire the heads of the agencies they govern, and must confirm changes to the permanent rules governing those agencies.  Constitution  In 1857, leaders of the Oregon Territory gathered at the Oregon Constitutional Convention and drafted a constitution for Oregon.Oregon Blue Book: Constitution of Oregon. Oregon Secretary of State, accessed October 19, 2007. On November 9, 1857, Oregon voters approved its first constitution that then became effective upon statehood on February 14, 1859. The constitution was unchanged for the remainder of the 19th century, but has been amended numerous times since 1902. The changes include the introduction of a direct legislation system, which enabled numerous popular decisions via initiative, both to the constitution and to the Oregon Revised Statutes. The current document contains eighteen sections, beginning with a bill of rights.Constitution of Oregon: 2005 Edition. Oregon Legislature, accessed October 19, 2007. Oregon's bill of rights contains most of the rights and privileges granted in the United States Bill of Rights and the main text of the United States Constitution. The remainder of the Oregon Constitution outlines the divisions of power within the state government, times of elections, designating the state capitol, the state boundaries.

Two of those courts are primarily trial level courts, while the other two are primarily courts of appeal. The chief executive of the OJD is the Chief Justice of the Oregon Supreme Court.An Introduction to the Courts of Oregon. Oregon Judicial Department. Retrieved on August 25, 2007. At the local level are some justice courts, municipal courts, and county courts.Other Courts. Oregon Judicial Department. Retrieved on February 18, 2009. The Oregon Supreme Court is located in the Oregon Supreme Court Building in Salem. It consists of seven judges that are elected to six-year terms in statewide popular elections, with vacancies filled by appointment by the Governor of Oregon. As the highest court in the state, it is the final authority on state law and its decisions can only be overturned by the United States Supreme Court. The court is headed by the Chief Justice, who is elected to a six-year term by fellow justices. Oregon's Court of Appeals is an intermediate court of appeals hearing appeals from decisions of both civil and criminal cases decided at the trial court level. This court has ten judges that in most cases sit in three judge panels to determine the outcome of appeals. The judges are also elected statewide to six-year terms, with vacancies filed by appointment of the governor. The Oregon Supreme Court's Chief Justice appoints one of the ten judges to serve as Chief Judge, who acts as the head of the Court of Appeals. Appeals from decisions of this court go to the Oregon Supreme Court. The OJD operates the Oregon Circuit Courts, which are 27 trial level court districts across the state that receive both civil and criminal court cases. As of January 2007, the courts had 173 judges spread over the 27 districts that cover the state's 36 circuit courts. The majority of appeals from the Circuit Courts go to the Oregon Court of Appeals. Some limited cases go directly to the Oregon Supreme Court if appealed from at the trial court level. Cases involving issues of taxation are handled primarily through the Oregon Tax Court. This court has two divisions, with the Magistrate Division being an informal process appearing more like alternative dispute resolution. The Regular Division is a formal court headed by a single Tax Court judge elected to six-year terms on a statewide basis. Appeals from the Magistrate Division go to the Regular Division, and appeals from decisions of this court go directly to the Oregon Supreme Court.

Willaman Professor of Astronomy & Astrophysics and a professor of physics at the Pennsylvania State University. He is best known for his work on active galaxies, cosmological X-ray surveys, starburst galaxies, normal galaxies, and X-ray binaries.  Education  Brandt was born in Durham, North Carolina, but mostly grew up in Janesville, Wisconsin. He attended Milton High School in Milton, Wisconsin, and Phillips Exeter Academy in Exeter, New Hampshire. His undergraduate studies were done at the California Institute of Technology (B.S. 1992), where he lived in Blacker Hovse (sharing a room with Ian Agol) and was awarded the George Green Prize for Creative Scholarship. His graduate studies were done at the Institute of Astronomy, Cambridge with Andrew Fabian.  Career  From 1996 to 1997 Brandt held a postdoctoral fellowship at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics where he worked with colleagues including Martin Elvis and Belinda Wilkes. In 1997, he took up an assistant professor appointment at the Pennsylvania State University. He was promoted to associate professor in 2001, full professor in 2003, Distinguished Professor in 2010, and Verne M. Willaman Professor in 2014.  Research and teaching  Brandt's research focuses on observational studies of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and cosmological X-ray surveys. Specific objects investigated include actively accreting SMBHs (i.e., active galactic nuclei: AGNs), starburst galaxies, and normal galaxies. His work utilizes data from facilities at the forefront of astrophysical discovery, including the Chandra X-ray Observatory, XMM-Newton, NuSTAR, and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. He is also involved with upcoming projects including the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, the Advanced Telescope for High Energy Astrophysics (ATHENA), and new X-ray missions. In his cosmological X-ray surveys work, Brandt has been a leader in obtaining the most-sensitive X-ray surveys to date, including the Chandra Deep Field-North and the Chandra Deep Field-South. These have been used to explore the demography, physics, and ecology of typical growing SMBHs over most of cosmic history. They have also allowed the study of X-ray source populations in starburst and normal galaxies out to cosmological distances. In his general AGN studies, he has investigated AGN winds, the X-ray properties of the first quasars, and extreme AGN populations (e.g., Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 galaxies and weak-line quasars). He has also worked on investigations of the cosmic microwave background radiation and the effects of neutron-star and black-hole natal kicks. Brandt is an author of more than 500 research papers on these subjects. Brandt leads a small research group including postdoctoral researchers, graduate students, and undergraduate students. Many of them, after developing their skills via their research projects, have gone on to win professorial and permanent staff positions as well as distinguished fellowships and scholarships, becoming new leaders around the world in astrophysics. Brandt also regularly teaches courses on high-energy astrophysics, black holes, and active galaxies.

She was launched on 8 May 1941 by Mrs Simpson, wife of a shipyard Director, and commissioned on 23 September 1941. Operational history Warrnambool began her career with patrols of Bass Strait, before heading to northern waters. She was in Darwin during the bombing of Darwin on 19 February 1942, although she was not damaged. A day later she was involved in the rescue of 73 crew from the Filipino merchant vessel , following attacks by Japanese dive bombers. During the rescue, the Japanese attacked Warrnambool but she received only minor damage. Over the next 12 months Warrnambool was involved in five evacuations or rescues (including that of HMAS Voyager‚Äôs crew following the destroyer running aground in September 1942), present for eighteen Japanese air raids, and transported over 4,000 troops to New Guinea. In late 1942, the corvette moved to the east coast of Australia, where she remained until September 1944, performing convoy escort and anti-submarine patrols. Following this Warrnambool was assigned to Fremantle, Western Australia, where she performed similar duties until February 1945, when she returned to Darwin. She was present at the Japanese surrender at Koepang, Timor, on 11 September 1945. HMAS Warrnambool sinking after striking a mine on 13 September 1947, near Cockburn Reef, Queensland. Following the conclusion of World War II, Warrnambool performed mine clearance work in the Solomon and New Guinea Islands before moving to the Great Barrier Reef. While performing clearance work on 13 September 1947, the corvette hit a mine around 16:00 near Cockburn Reef, off the northern Queensland coast. Four sailors were killed and another 29 were injured. Warrnambool sank shortly afterward, in of water. The wreck was sold to Southern Cross Diving and Salvage on 3 July 1972. A Board of Inquiry found that there was no culpable negligence in the loss of the corvette, and praised the conduct of her crew and commanding officer. Warrnambool is the only RAN ship to be sunk by a mine. A survey conducted in 2016 by found that the wreck of Warrnambool remained largely intact.

In 1939, Goldberg became a founding member of the Contemporary Arts Society (in French, Soci√©t√© d'art contemporain), a group of Canadian artists intent on sensitizing the public to modern art. His work has been exhibited in Europe, Asia, and North America. He married Quebec-born Regina Seiden (1897) - a well-respected artist in her own right - who studied under the Canadian traditionalist masters William Brymner and Maurice Cullen.

Van Patten, who served as Track Manager for the Southern Section in 1913 and is recognized as the founding father of the CIF-SS, served in that post until 1928 when he was officially named Secretary of the organization. He served as Commissioner until his retirement in 1951. On March 28, 1914, the Southern Section came under the administrative wing of the newly founded California Interscholastic Federation, and has since grown into one of the most progressive and respected organizations of its kind in the world. CIF-SS archives date back over 100 years! Despite its lengthy history, the Southern Section lists just nine Commissioners (the term Secretary dropped) with William Russell holding the post from 1951‚Äì54, J. Kenneth Fagans being the administrative head from 1954 until his retirement in early 1975, Thomas E. Byrnes accepting the Commissioner's post in 1975, while Ray Plutko served from 1980 to 1986. Stan Thomas served as Commissioner from July, 1986 to October, 1993 when Dean Crowley was appointed Acting Commissioner and was Commissioner of Athletics from July, 1994 until his retirement in September, 1999. James Staunton Ed.D., served as Commissioner from September 1, 1999, until his retirement on July 31, 2011. Rob Wigod, the current Commissioner, began his service as Commissioner on August 1, 2011 after having served as Assistant Commissioner for 11 years. CIF SS Headquarters in Los Alamitos, California The ‚Äúhome‚Äù of the Southern Section has a varied history. At the outset, basements, surplus school rooms and even the homes of secretaries served as the official office. South Pasadena High School graciously permitted the use of one of its rooms during the 1930s, with Oneonta School and South Pasadena High School serving as the home office from 1942 until 1949. There was a period of time the office was in the home of Commissioner Seth Van Patten. Still without an official office, the Southern Section moved its supplies to Helms Hall, a bakery in Culver City in 1949 and remained at the Venice Blvd. site until 1959. It was in February of that year that the Southern Section built its first ever administration office, located on the corners of Carmona and West Washington in Los Angeles. As membership grew and the Sections‚Äô population center moved, so did the CIF-SS office. In 1965, the Section office built and moved into its third home and second devoted strictly to the CIF-SS day-to-day operations. That space was located next to Gahr High School on Artesia Blvd. in the city of Cerritos. That remained the home base of the section until October 2002 when the ever-expanding membership required a larger facility. Thus, the new and current administrative home became the Pine Street location in Los Alamitos. Historical news clippings of CIFSS sports The California Interscholastic Federation, Southern Section, is a non-profit corporation organized to direct and control both boys and girls athletics in the secondary schools within the Section. The Southern Section is administered on a day-to- day basis by the Commissioner, five Assistant Commissioners, a chief Financial Officer, a Marketing Manager and a staff of eight support personnel. The Southern Section is not only the oldest, but the largest of 10 such sections in the state‚Äîits membership has grown from an original 30 schools to over 560+ schools and from 5 leagues to almost 90 leagues.

Although the district was formally established in 1906, the first known school building in the area was built in 1851. It was a small, single- room adobe structure, crudely constructed, and heated with a one small stove.  History  Murray High School Between 1874 and 1900, three brick schools were built and rebuilt to keep up with the growing population. In 1905, Murray City annexed an area of land that increased the population to 5000. As a result, the city decided it was necessary to have its own school district, which enrolled nearly 1000 pupils in the first year. There was a staff of twenty teachers, and two music and art specialists. A beginning teacher made $45 a month. The three school buildings in the newly established district were renamed through a student competition in 1906. The names selected were Arlington School (formerly District #25 and Central School), Liberty School (formerly District #24 and Winchester School), and Pioneer School, located near 300 West and 5300 South. By 1911, Bonnyview and Hillcrest Schools had been built. Development of a high-school curriculum began in the 1913-14 school year, at the Hillcrest School. A new grade level was added each year until diplomas were awarded in May 1917, to the first five high-school graduates. Kindergarten was permanently instituted in the 1920s. Between 1950 and 1970, the district experienced rapid growth. Seven schools were built: a new Murray High School facility, Riverview Junior High, and McMillan, Grant, Viewmont, Parkside, and Longview elementary schools. Horizon Elementary School was built in the 1980s, when the old Arlington School was converted into Murray's new city hall. Creekside High School was an alternative high school for adult students and teenagers that needed help in schooling. The school was closed in the 2006-07 school year, due to dropping student numbers, and the remaining students were transferred to Murray High School.  The district today  Today, the district has over 6000 students in grades K‚Äì12, enrolled in seven elementary schools, two junior highs, and one high school. Murray schools benefit from the PTA, Murray Education Foundation (a nonprofit organization assisting in recognizing excellence in the schools and resources for special school needs), Murray High School Renaissance Program, each school's Community Council, and an adult Community Education program with diverse class offerings. The rebuilt Murray High, the district's newest school, opened in 2003, and has an enrollment of around 1500 students. The school is built on the same as the previous high school. It is a state-of-the- art facility, with high ceilings and skylights, a commons area, wireless network connections in every classroom (internet access is restricted), a geothermal heating and cooling system, an expanded auditorium, two gyms, and a courtyard. Hillcrest and Riverview Junior High schools have a combined enrollment of nearly 1500 students. Both schools have many extracurricular activities, including athletics, choir, and band. There is a variety of opportunities for academic enrichment through an interdisciplinary curriculum that focuses on higher-level thinking skills, problem solving, research, and independent studies. The seven elementary schools average around 22 students per classroom. The Kennecott Nature Center of Murray gives students the opportunity to enjoy observing and learning about nature up close and hands on.  District-wide energy-saving program  At the beginning of the 2007-2008 school year, district administrators started a program to save energy and money. Murray is the first school district in the Salt Lake Valley to implement such a program. Adjustments were made in district buildings, including changes to thermostats. During weekends and long breaks, copy machines and computers are unplugged, and running water to restrooms is turned off. Students also help by recycling. The extra money saved goes to improve the budgets of school programs.  Superintendents  *Gideon M. Mumford, July 1905 - June 1912 *Carl Ephraim Gaufin, June 1912 - July 28, 1928 (died) *E.

Early life Warner was born in Middlebury, Vermont, the son of Joseph and Jane Anne (Meech) Warner. He graduated from Kimball Union Academy in Meriden, New Hampshire in 1854, and attended Middlebury College for two years, until he was accepted as a cadet in the United States Military Academy on July 1, 1855. He graduated from West Point on July 1, 1860, standing 40th in a class of 41. brevet 2nd Lieutenant Warner was assigned to the 10th U.S. Infantry, and, on February 28, 1861, was promoted to 2nd Lieutenant and transferred to the 8th U.S. Infantry. He was then promoted to 1st Lieutenant May 31, 1861, and assigned to Fort Wise, Colorado Territory. Lieutenant Warner probably received a first-rate education in North-South politics while stationed at Fort Wise. Among the officers there at the start of the war were Maj. John Sedgwick, future commander of the Sixth Corps; William S. Walker, a Pennsylvanian who went with the Confederacy, probably because of his marriage to a Floridian; Richard Riddick, who would fall leading his 34th North Carolina at Gaines' Mill and William D. DeSaussure, who died at Gettysburg leading his 15th South Carolina; Edward Newby, of Virginia and James McIntyre, of Tennessee, both of whom would stay with the Union; and the redoubtable James Ewell Brown \\"J.E.B.\\" Stuart, who would become the bane of many a Union cavalry trooper. Civil War The State of Vermont asked for Warner's services to lead a volunteer regiment, which was agreed to, and he was appointed colonel on September 1, 1862, and assigned to command the 11th Vermont Infantry (also known as the 1st Artillery, Vermont Volunteers). His regiment was assigned to the northern defenses of Washington, D.C., from September 1862 until May 1864, when Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant called for more troops to support his Overland Campaign. The 11th Vermont joined the Vermont Brigade after the Battle of the Wilderness, and first saw action at the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House. In his first engagement, on May 18, 1864, Warner was severely wounded, but refused to leave the field until the end of the day. He was sent home on furlough to recover. He returned from convalescence leave on July 8, 1864, and was assigned to command the 1st brigade, Hardin's division, XXII Corps, in the defenses of Washington. He returned to his regiment later that month, but was reassigned to command the 1st Brigade, 2nd Division, VI Corps in September 1864. He commanded that brigade until it was disbanded in May 1865. On January 31, 1865, President Abraham Lincoln nominated Warner for appointment to the grade of brevet brigadier general, Volunteers, to rank from April 1, 1864, \\"for gallant and meritorious service\\" at the battle of Spotsylvania Court House, and at the battles of Winchester, Fisher's Hill and Cedar Creek and the United States Senate confirmed the appointment on February 14, 1865.Eicher, John H., and David J. Eicher, Civil War High Commands. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2001. . p. 760. Warner was promoted him to captain, 8th U.S. Infantry, in the Regular Army (United States) on October 8, 1864. He also received brevets as major, lieutenant colonel and colonel, U.S. Army, to rank from March 13, 1865, \\"for gallant and meritorious service during the war.\\" Warner was appointed brigadier general, volunteers, on May 8, 1865, to rank from May 8, 1865, although his nomination to this grade was sent to the U.S. Senate only on January 13, 1866 and was confirmed by the Senate on February 23, 1866.Eicher, 2001, p. 730. On July 17, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Warner for appointment to the grade of brevet brigadier general, U.S. Army, to rank from April 9, 1865, \\"for gallant and meritorious services in the field during the war\\" and the U.S. Senate confirmed the appointment on July 23, 1866.Eicher, 2001, p. 738. He mustered out of voluntary service on January 1, 1866, and resigned his regular army commission on February 13. Postwar activities After the war, Warner moved to Albany, New York, where he engaged in paper manufacturing as president of the Albany Card and Paper Company. On December 19, 1889, he was appointed postmaster of Albany by President Benjamin Harrison's administration. Warner died March 16, 1897, in New York City, and his remains were returned to Middlebury, Vermont, for interment. James Warner married Matilda Elizabeth Allen, daughter of George Allen and Sophia Sargent, in early June 1863, while he was stationed in the northern defenses of Washington.

The rest of the body was made by Matra from fibreglass and polyester, including the mouldings adorning the body, which made it look more \\"sturdy\\". This technology would later be used on the Renault Espace, Europe's first MPV, which was manufactured by Matra. The ground clearance was also increased. Unlike most off-roaders, it was not fitted with all-wheel drive, retaining the 1100's front-wheel drive layout. Other elements retained from the 1100 included the dashboard and front seats (identical to the ones found in the Simca 1100 GLS). The Rancho was powered by the 1,442 cc, 80 bhp version of the \\"Poissy engine\\" straight-four engine. During its life, the Rancho was offered in several versions. Apart from the basic Rancho, there was the Grand Raid, fitted with such off-road extras as an electric winch on the front bumper and an extra spare wheel mounted on the roof - as well as a limited-slip differential. It also received undercarriage protection, bronze tinted windows, and was only available in a matte green colour. The Rancho X was the upscale model, with additional standard items such as alloy wheels and metallic paint. The D√©couvrable model's rear cabin consisted of an open frame with roll-down fabric covers, which could serve as an \\"open\\" car during good weather. Finally, the Rancho AS was the commercial version, with no rear seat, making it exempt from the French tax on passenger cars. The Rancho spawned an unlikely successor: the Renault Espace. Matra wanted to replace the Rancho with their prototype of the Espace known as the ‚Äúdessin orange‚Äù, which translates to ‚Äúthe orange drawing‚Äù in English ‚Äì both the prototype and the background it was drawn on were orange. It predicted the basic shape of the first Espace but only had three doors instead of five. Peugeot (who controlled Matra at the time) deemed the project too expensive and not promising enough. Determined to take its design to production Matra knocked on Renault‚Äôs door and they quickly adopted the project, one that upon its launch in 1984 arguably became the first European minivan.

Main began his senior football career in the Highland League, for whom he made his debut as a 15-year-old for his hometown team, Lossiemouth, transferring to Elgin City during the 1986‚Äì87 season. Main then transferred to top-tier Dundee United, signing a full-time contract, and remained with the club for nine years. He also played for St Johnstone, Livingston and Gretna in a twenty-year full-time professional career. In addition, Main appeared for Cowdenbeath and East Stirlingshire on loan and Ayr United as a trialist. He began his second spell with St Johnstone in 2007, and during the 2008‚Äì9 season helped them win promotion to the Scottish Premier League as well as breaking the club's all-time appearance record. He won the Scottish League Cup with Livingston in 2004 and three Scottish Football League divisional medals. He also earned runners-up medals from the Scottish Cup and the UEFA Cup, having been part of the Dundee United squad that reached the 1987 final of the latter during his first professional season. Despite having been called up the Scotland squad, Main was never capped at full international level. He did however represent Scotland in under-21 and B international fixtures. Early life Alan Main was born in Elgin, Morayshire, on 5 December 1967 and grew up in nearby Lossiemouth, the youngest of four children. His father, Louis, played in the Highland Football League for Forres Mechanics. Alan and both of his brothers would also go on to play in the Highland League. Main played as a goalkeeper from an early age with Elgin Boys Club. He had the opportunity to sign for Motherwell on schoolboy forms, but turned the offer down due to the distance from his family home. Career Main began his professional career with Lossiemouth his local club Highland League Club before transferring to neighbours and fellow Highland Club, Elgin City. From Elgin City he was transferred to Dundee United, making his d√©but as a nineteen-year-old. He spent nine years at Tannadice, mostly under manager Jim McLean, even making Andy Roxburgh's Scotland squad. Due to make his d√©but against Malta, he hurt his back and required an operation that kept him out of action for nine months.\\"TANGERINE50 GUEST TOMORROW: ALAN MAIN OOH AHH!\\" - Dundee United F.C., 6 March, 2020 Main signed for Dundee United's Tayside rivals St Johnstone in 1995 for ‚Ç§150,000 as competition for Saints' then first-choice goalkeeper Andy Rhodes. Known for his long kicks and dribbling skills outside his box, Main signed a three-year deal with the Perth club in 1997 and was again called up to the Scotland squad (this time by Craig Brown) not long afterwards. He made the substitutes' bench twice, but with Jim Leighton and Andy Goram ahead of him in the pecking order, he never took to the field. Main broke his shin in a September 2001 game against Motherwell and was out of the game for over a year, missing Saints' relegation to the First Division. Main returned to first-team action in October 2002, despite Kevin Cuthbert ‚Äì Main's deputy ‚Äì having just won the First Division Player of the Month award. Four months after returning to first-team football, Main ended his nine-year association with the Perth club and returned to the Premier League with Livingston. In February 2004, Main was one of a number of players affected by financial problems at Livingston and was asked to take a pay cut to remain at the club. Within days, Celtic indicated their interest in signing Main. Along with the other five players asked to accept reduced terms, Main agreed to remain at Livingston for the remainder of the season. Following the beginning of the 2004‚Äì05 season, Main joined Scottish Third Division side Gretna on a three-year deal and went on to feature in each of their consecutive championship wins, culminating in promotion to the Scottish Premier League. Main guested for Shamrock Rovers in a friendly against Hibernian in July 2005.Can't find that Page On 6 March 2007, two months before Gretna's promotion to the top flight, it was announced that Main had signed a pre-contract agreement with his former club St Johnstone on a two-year deal. Despite turning 41 in 2008, Main was still the number-one keeper for St Johnstone going into 2009. In April 2009, he overtook Drew Rutherford to become the player with the most appearances for the club. He also signed a one-year contract extension until May 2010, making him a part of the squad promoted back to the Scottish Premier League for the first time in seven years. At 42, Main was the oldest registered player in the Scottish Premier League during the 2009‚Äì10 season. Main started in the first nine SPL games of the 2009‚Äì10 season before being edged out by former Kilmarnock and Rangers goalkeeper Graeme Smith, who had missed the early part of the season due to an injury sustained in a pre-season match. During this run in the team Main saved a Derek Riordan penalty in a 3-1 win over Hibernian in the Scottish League Cup. Main remained on the substitutes' bench after Smith made his way into the starting line-up, and was released by St Johnstone at the end of the 2009‚Äì10 season, having become the player with the most appearances for the club (361). This record was broken by Steven Anderson in 2016.[http://www.deadlinenews.co.uk/2016/03/20/st-johnstone-midfielder-murray- davidson-lavishes-praise-record-breaker-steven-anderson/ \\"St Johnstone midfielder Murray Davidson lavishes praise on record breaker Steven Anderson\\" - Capital City Press, 20 March, 2016 In recognition of his achievements and services to St Johnstone over his two spells at the club, a series of events were planned for throughout 2010 as part of Main's testimonial year. These events included a race night and also a hosted dinner. Main was also granted a testimonial match against a Manchester United XI, which was played at McDiarmid Park on 31 July 2010. On 21 August 2010, Main appeared as a trialist goalkeeper for Ayr United and kept a clean sheet in their 1‚Äì0 victory over Dumbarton. At 42 years 259 days old, he became the oldest player ever to play for Ayr United. However, after making two further league appearances against PeterheadAyr United vs. Peterhead - 28 August 2010 - Soccerway and Alloa Athletic,Alloa Athletic vs. Ayr United - 11 September 2010 - Soccerway a permanent contract did not come to fruition. Main joined Rangers in January 2011 as temporary cover for goalkeeping coach Jim Stewart, who was undergoing knee surgery. Main stayed in this position until 3 March. He officially announced his retirement as a player on 26 March 2011. Main was inducted into Dundee United's Hall of Fame in 2013.\\"2013\\" - Dundee United F.C.

Early life Roback was born on April 4, 1958 and raised in Los Angeles, California, a son of nurse Rosemary (n√©e Hunter) and physician George Roback. He graduated from Palisades High School, before studying art at Carleton College and the University of California in Berkeley. He and his brother Stephen Roback, a bass guitarist, formed the band Unconscious alongside Susanna Hoffs, who would go on to become the lead singer and guitarist of The Bangles. Career Roback was active in the Paisley Underground indie music scene in Los Angeles in the early to mid-1980s as leader of the band Rain Parade, which was popular on the local club circuit. Shortly after the release of their debut album in 1983, Emergency Third Rail Power Trip, Roback left Rain Parade to join Rainy Day, a collective featuring other musicians from the Paisley Underground. Their first and only album was issued in 1984, which also featured contributions from The Dream Syndicate vocalist Kendra Smith. That same year, Roback and Smith formed Clay Allison, changing that band name to Opal by the time they released their debut album in 1987, Happy Nightmare Baby. While promoting the album, Smith acrimoniously exited the band while they were partway through a tour opening for The Jesus and Mary Chain. She was replaced by Hope Sandoval, but this lineup never released an album; they changed the name of the band to Mazzy Star in 1989. Mazzy Star released three albums in the 1990s: She Hangs Brightly (1990), So Tonight That I Might See (1993), and Among My Swan (1996), making their commercial breakthrough with the 1994 single \\"Fade into You\\" before going on hiatus. In the years that followed, Roback produced and recorded music with other artists: he produced songs on Beth Orton's 1999 album Central Reservation and performed on Bert Jansch's 2006 album The Black Swan, among others. Roback wrote and produced the songs that actress Maggie Cheung sang in the 2004 film Clean. He also played himself in the film. He spent much of his later life in Norway, where he collaborated with various musicians and created original music for art installations. He reunited with Sandoval to release Mazzy Star's fourth studio album in 2013, Seasons of Your Day, followed by the 2018 EP Still, which was promoted with a three-night residency at the Sydney Opera House. Prior to his death, Roback had been working with Kendra Smith on re-releases of Happy Nightmare Baby and a compilation of Opal EPs titled Early Recordings, both of which are \\"imminently\\" due for release via INgrooves. Death Roback died in Los Angeles on February 24, 2020 from metastatic cancer. Numerous musicians paid tribute to him, including Susanna Hoffs, Clairo, Jennifer O'Connor, Joe Pernice, Craig Wedren, Steve Wynn, Matthew Caws of Nada Surf, Doug Gillard of Guided by Voices, Grasshopper of Mercury Rev, J Mascis of Dinosaur Jr., Mac McCaughan of Superchunk, Colin Meloy of The Decemberists, Anton Newcombe of The Brian Jonestown Massacre, A. C. Newman of The New Pornographers, Simon Raymonde of Cocteau Twins, as well as bands The Pastels, Sleigh Bells and The Vacant Lots. Impact and legacy Roback's songwriting and guitar work has, according to Alexis Petridis of The Guardian, been highly influential, \\"most strikingly on Lana Del Rey: you could clearly detect [Mazzy Star's] shadow ... on her breakthrough album Born to Die, a more explicit examination of the LA darkness that had always lurked somewhere in Mazzy Star's sound. In turn, Del Rey went on to exert a vast influence of her own, which meant that one of the most reticent bands in recent history ended up becoming a part of latter-day pop's musical DNA.\\" References External links * * Category:1958 births Category:2020 deaths Category:Alternative rock guitarists Category:American alternative rock musicians Category:American rock guitarists Category:American male guitarists Category:Deaths from cancer in California Category:Songwriters from California Category:Musicians from Los Angeles Category:20th-century American guitarists Category:Mazzy Star members Category:Rainy Day (band) members Category:Opal (band) members Category:Guitarists from California Category:20th-century American male musicians ","title":"David Roback"},{"id":"6622586","title":"Dick Warlock"},{"id":"6622596","text":"Uti possidetis juris or uti possidetis iuris (Latin for \\"as you possess under law\\") is a principle of international law which provides that newly-formed sovereign states should retain the internal borders that their preceding dependent area had before their independence. History Uti possidetis juris is a modified form of uti possidetis; created for the purpose of avoiding terra nullius, the original version of uti possidetis began as a Roman law governing the rightful possession of property. During the medieval period it evolved into a law governing international relations and has recently been modified for situations of newly independent states. Application Uti possidetis juris has been applied in modern history to such regions as South America, Africa, the Soviet Union, and numerous other regions where centralized governments were broken up, or where imperial rulers were overthrown. It is often applied to prevent foreign intervention by eliminating any contested terra nullius, or no man's land, that foreign powers could claim, or to prevent disputes that could emerge with the possibility of redrawing the borders of new states after their independence.

Overview Robert Hollingworth is an Australian artist and writer with an abiding interest in Australian history, environment, ecology, the natural sciences and nature in general. He now writes, paints and makes videoworks full-time. Background Hollingworth was born at Lorne, Victoria. His parents bought 40 hectares of ocean-front land in 1947, and later, his father built White Gables,. This imposing double storey residence was destroyed in the Ash Wednesday bushfires and the farmland today accommodates some eighty modern dwellings. His family eventually settled at Anglesea, Victoria and Hollingworth went on to complete a four-year Diploma of Art at the Gordon Technical College, Geelong. He subsequently founded the Geelong Fine Art Studios, a private art school, which he operated from 1977‚Äì1984. During this time he was Vice President of the Geelong Art Gallery, and co-founder of Artery, an artist-run gallery in Geelong. He moved to Melbourne in 1989 and later became a teacher/lecturer at various public institutions including RMIT University from 1996‚Äì2001. In 2015, he moved to Kings Point on the South Coast NSW with wife Karen Boulden. They set up THE WALL art projects in Ulladulla and established new studios. Art Hollingworth is primarily a painter and video artist. He has held more than forty exhibitions, mostly in Australia, but also USA, Hong Kong and Singapore. Among other art awards he has won the Sulman Prize 1990, the Castlemaine Drawing Prize 1994 and the Mount Buller Art Prize 2008. His work is held in many Australian public art collections. He is represented by commercial galleries in Melbourne and Sydney. \\"Hollingworth's vast paintings of astral planes and planetary systems have long offset their basis in meticulous research ... While seemingly scientific in detail and subject matter, they are in fact hypothetical-imagined spacescapes that deal with the universe's place in our collective psychology.\\" Dan Rule, The Age 14/6/2013 Writing Hollingworth began writing professionally in his late forties. His first full length literary work, was Nature Boy 2004, a part-autobiographical work detailing a little-known aspect of early Australian colonial life from the perspective of four generations of his family. This work attracted some interest on ABC Radio 774Peter Clarke, Sunday Arts, 2004 This was followed by They called me The Wildman 2008, which was shortlisted to five for the South Australian Premier's Literary Awards in 2010, won by David Malouf. This work is an account of Henricke Nelsen's life, a 19th-century recluse in Australia and a contemporary of the bushranger, Ned Kelly. \\"Nelsen has a great fondness for the bush, tempered by an ambivalence regarding his place in it as an interloper. In the process of exploring this question, Hollingworth conducts an internal debate relevant not only to the 19th century but also to the 21st.\\" David Messer, Sydney Morning Herald, April 19‚Äì20, 2008, A gifted storyteller gives voice to Victoria's Wildman \\"Hollingworth's sympathetic and vivid appropriation of the story, his gift for making it seem both the tale of an emigrant, an outsider, and one who immersed himself ... in the natural world of Australia, is an engaging and persuasive exercise in fact cum fiction.\\"Peter Pierce, Canberra Times, March 18, 2008 More recent novels include Smythe's Theory of Everything, 2011, reviewed on Radio National, Australia.Radio National, Life Matters, Richard Aedy, 24/11/2011 and And So It Was, 2013; The Colour of the Night 2014.

Sexsmith Community Elementary is a public elementary school in Vancouver, British Columbia part of School District 39 Vancouver.  History  John Wesley Sexsmith was born in Richmond, County of Lennox, Ontario on May 10, 1830, to parents who were both members of United Empire Loyalist families. Educated in the common schools of Ontario, Sexsmith entered the lumber business and also tried his hand as a general merchant and established a cheese factory. Sexsmith soon encountered financial hardships and decided to try out his fortune in the West. Mr. Sexsmith's westward journey eventually brought him to a plot of land on what was then known as Lulu Island. Drawing from his experience back in Ontario, Sexsmith established a cheese factory and soon grew so successful that he extended his land holdings to some on Lulu Island as well as several hundred acres in modern-day Pitt Meadows. To overcome transportation difficulties, Sexsmith established a boat service on the North Fraser River to New Westminster. As the population of the area gradually increased, Sexsmith became active in the organization of the district into the Municipality of Richmond and served as its Reeve. For a number of years, Sexsmith was largely responsible for the building of bridges to join Marpole, Sea Island and Lulu Island. Both Mr. and Mrs. Sexsmith was actively involved in teaching. Mrs. Sexsmith, one of the first teachers in the area with professional qualifications, taught at a school in Gastown provided by the Moodyville Lumber Company. Mr. Sexsmith established a Ryerson System school to provide education for the surrounding families. The school was one of the first of the strictly rural schools established on the mainland of British Columbia. In February 2016, the original J.W. Sexsmith School was torn down. On October 13th, 2013 the new building was officially opened at the back of the schoolground. A new road was put in that connects Columbia St. The new address for the school is J.W.

New South Wales and Norfolk Island  Musquito of the Gai-Mariagal clan, was born in Hawkesbury/Broken Bay region of Sydney.https://press- files.anu.edu.au/downloads/press/p21521/html/frames.php Musquito engaged in violent raids on British settlements in the Hawkesbury and Georges River areas in 1805. The Sydney Gazette reported that he committed to further raids \\"in good English\\"; on 9 June 1805 the colony authorities authorised his arrest. He was captured by local Aboriginal people in July 1805 and gaoled in Parramatta, but not charged. Governor Philip Gidley King exiled him and a fellow \\"principal\\" in the raiding, \\"Bull Dog\\", to the convict colony on Norfolk Island. As part of the evacuation of Norfolk Island, Musquito was sent in January 1813 on the ship Minstrel with other convicts to Port Dalrymple in what was then called Van Diemen's Land.  To Van Diemen's Land  In 1814, Musquito's brother Philip convinced governor Lachlan Macquarie to allow Musquito to return to Sydney, but Musquito remained in Van Diemen's Land. Musquito worked as an Aboriginal tracker of bushrangers. For his services as a tracker of bushrangers, Musquito was promised repatriation to Sydney by lieutenant-governor William Sorell in 1817, but this did not occur. By February 1818 he was a servant of the prominent and wealthy settler and entrepreneur, Edward Lord, and some sources say that in October 1818 he helped track and kill bushranger Michael Howe. Ostracised by the convicts, and disillusioned by Sorell's broken promise to return Musquito to Sydney, Musquito decided to leave the settlement for the bush. Now called Tasmania.  The \\"tame gang\\", raids and execution  Musquito formed the \\"tame gang\\", of 20 to 30 companions, and joined the Oyster Bay tribe (of Great Oyster Bay). In November 1823 and later in 1824, Musquito and the tame gang raided farms on the east coast of Tasmania and killed several stockmen. In August 1824, he was captured and wounded by Tegg (also rendered Teague), an Aboriginal boy. Musquito was charged with aiding and abetting the murder of a Tahitian farm hand named Mammoa and settler George Meredith's servant, William Hollyoak, at Grindstone Bay, and tried in December 1824 along with a comrade called \\"Black Jack\\". Musquito was found guilty of the death of Hollyoak, but not of Mammoa, and was sentenced to death by hanging. The sentence was carried out at Old Hobart Gaol on 25 February 1825. Historian Naomi Parry describes the evidence arrayed against Musquito for aiding and abetting as \\"dubious\\" and says that after his death it \\"remained unclear whether Musquito committed any murders\\". Musquito's contemporary Henry Melville called the conviction a \\"most extraordinary precedent\\" and Gilbert Robertson said it provoked further violence.

Had it been completed, the skeleton tower would have been among the most exposed lighthouses in the United States. Funds were appropriated for the lighthouse by the U. S. Congress in 1871, but construction progressed slowly. The site was some away from the nearest land, and contractors had great difficulty in laying the foundation for a tower. It was decided that workers would be housed in a shelter on a platform on the site; this was finally completed in 1873, and work began in earnest. On November 16, 1873, the site was struck by a strong hurricane. The lighthouse tender attached to the site, which was carrying most of the materials needed to build the tower, was wrecked; her crew were rescued by a nearby steamer. Although it was decided that the workmen should remain on station, on November 18 the continued rough weather destroyed their quarters and scattered the 16 men into the sea. Remarkably, all 16 were saved by the same steamer that had rescued the tender's crew two days previously. As a result of the weather troubles, the Lighthouse Board decided that a tower was no longer needed on the shoal, and called off construction. Some of the materials were later salvaged and used in the building of the Southwest Pass Light. Trinity Shoal was marked with a lightvessel, which was eventually replaced by a small automatic light.

He was also a noted painter. Biography Our Camp at Cha-ink-pah River, watercolor, by Alfred Sully, c. 1856 Sully was the son of the portrait painter, Thomas Sully, of Pennsylvania. Alfred Sully graduated from West Point in 1841. During and after the American Civil War, Sully served in the Plains States and was widely regarded as an Indian fighter. Sully, like his father, was a watercolorist and oil painter. Between 1849 and 1853, he became chief quartermaster of the U.S. troops at Monterey, California, after California came under American jurisdiction. Then, Sully created a number of watercolor and some oil paintings reflecting the social life of Monterey during that period. Commands Sully headed US troops out of Ft. Leavenworth, Kansas, in June 1861 as captain and occupied the city of St Joseph, Missouri, declaring martial law. Violent secessionist uprisings in the city during the early Civil War prompted Sully's occupation. Sully was commissioned colonel of the 1st Minnesota Volunteer Infantry on February 3, 1862. He led his regiment during the Peninsula Campaign, sustaining a minor wound at Glendale. Sully was promoted to brigadier general on September 26 and led a brigade in the II Corps during the Battle of Fredericksburg, but on May 1, 1863, was removed from command by his division commander, Brig. Gen John Gibbon after failing to suppress a mutiny by the 34th New York when several of its companies refused to fight on the grounds that their two-year enlistment term was about to expire. Gibbon attempted to have Sully court-martialed for dereliction of duty, although a court of inquiry found him innocent of these charges, he was removed from command of his brigade and exiled to the Great Plains, never to serve in the Civil War again. After being relieved of command, Sully went west and gained notoriety for committing several massacres against natives. On September 3, 1863, at Whitestone Hill, Dakota Territory, as reprisal for the Dakota Conflict of 1862, his troops destroyed a village of some 500 tipis that lodged Yankton, Dakota, Hunkpapa and Sihasapa Lakota. Warriors, along with women and children, were killed or captured. The troopers' casualties were small. With the end of the Civil War, Sully's commission as a brigadier general expired and he reverted to the rank of major in the regular army. Despite frequent bouts of ill health, he continued serving in the Indian Wars until his death at Ft. Vancouver, Oregon, on April 27, 1879. The cause of death was ruled to be an aortic hemorrhage due to complications from an esophageal ulcer. Sully was buried in Laurel Hill Cemetery, Philadelphia.The Essential Civil War Marriage Sully was married three times. After the Mexican War, in 1851, Sully was posted as Quartermaster to the Presidio of Monterey, California, and married Mar√≠a Manuela Antonia Jimeno y de la Guerra. Tragically, soon after childbirth, Manuela died in 1852. Compounding the tragedy was the death of their newborn son, Thomas, 18 days later. From September 1856 through May1857, Sully was posted to Fort Pierre, Nebraska Territory (now South Dakota). He met and, by Sioux tribal custom, married a young French-Yankton girl of the Yankton Sioux tribe. With this marriage, Sully became the son-in-law of Saswe, a.k.a. Fran√ßois Deloria (Saswe being the Dakota pronunciation of Fran√ßois), a powerful Yankton medicine man and chief of the \\"Half-Breed band\\". In 1869, Sully married Sophia Henrietta Palmer in Manhattan, New York.

Marello served as an aide to the Bishop of Asti prior to his episcopal appointment after Pope Leo XIII named him to head the Acqui diocese; the pope had known Marello while a cardinal when the pair participated in the First Vatican Council more than a decade before. He became a proponent for the poor and destitute and never stopped to render his assistance to those who needed it the most; this was something he undertook even in his childhood. Bishop Marello issued several pastoral letters that dealt with a range of issues such as catechism and organized one big pastoral visitation to visit all parishes in his diocese. Marello's cause for sainthood resulted in his beatification on 26 September 1993 in Asti and his canonization less than a decade later on 25 November 2001 in Saint Peter's Square.

He had a younger brother named Vittorio. His godparents were Chiaffredo Viale and Teresa Secco. He received his Confirmation on 15 August 1855 from the Bishop of Asti Filippo Artico. He was an altar server in his childhood, and he often invited the homeless to his home for food. His father was a friend of Giuseppe Benedetto Cottolengo. Marello's mother died on 5 April 1848, and in 1852 his father decided to relocate with his children to San Martino Alfieri, where his paternal grandparents resided. Marello began his studies for the priesthood on 31 October 1856, but his father wished him to continue with his education and take up a career in business. But in December 1863 Giuseppe contracted typhus and promised the Virgin Mary that if he survived he would continue his studies to become a priest. He recovered, and attributed the cure to Our Lady of Consolation. He continued on with his ecclesial studies in February 1864. At one stage je considered becoming a Carthusian monk, but the new Bishop of Asti, Carlo Savio, dissuaded him, suggesting that God had other plans for him. Marello underwent the clerical investiture on 9 January 1864, and received both the tonsure and all minor orders from Bishop Savio on 21 December 1867. He was made a subdeacon on 28 March 1868, and was elevated to the diaconate on 6 June 1868. Marello was ordained to the priesthood on 19 September 1868 with Savio again officiating. The new priest celebrated his first Mass on 20 September 1868 in San Martino Alfieri. After his ordination, he became the private assistant to Bishop Savio at Asti on 21 October 1868. He served in that capacity until 1881. On 2 March 1880 he was named a Canon of the Asti Cathedral. He was also friends with Giovanni Bosco and Leonardo Murialdo. He attended the First Vatican Council with Bishop Savio and it was there that he met Cardinal Gioacchino Pecci - the future Pope Leo XIII - who praised the priest for his virtues and talents. He and Savio went to Rome on 21 November 1869 and were there until late July 1870; he even had the chance to meet Pope Pius IX. His father died on 17 May 1873. Later he took over an Asti retirement home to save it from being bankrupt and he soon became the spiritual director and catechist in his local diocese. On 14 March 1878 he founded the Oblates of Saint Joseph which would be dedicated to caring for the poor and educating children and adolescents as well as rendering assisting bishops in whatever capacities were required. =Episcopate= Pope Leo XIII appointed him Bishop of Acqui on 11 February 1889. The formal appointment as a bishop came on 11 February 1889 during a consistory for the elevation of new cardinals after having received word of his appointment in November 1888 (in the late morning) since the pope wanted to invest new bishops with the rochet at the consistory. From 5:30 to 6:15pm on 10 February he met with the pope and that evening had dinner with Cardinal Luigi Oreglia di Santo Stefano. He received his episcopal consecration on 17 February, from Cardinal Raffaele Monaco La Valletta in the Capuchin Santa Maria della Concezione dei Cappuccini in Rome. The co-consecrators were the Archbishop of Chieti Rocco Cocchia and the Archbishop of Damiata Ignazio Persico. He visited all the parishes in his diocese and wrote six pastoral letters to his flock. He issued his first pastoral letter on the subject of peace on 31 May 1889 and issued another on 2 February 1890 regarding a pastoral visitation that he would undertake. From 13 April 1890 to 1895 he visited 143 individual parishes. On 16 December 1890 he received an honorary degree in sacred theology from the Theological College of Saint Thomas in Genoa, and then issued a third pastoral letter regarding penance on 13 January 1891. On 26 September 1891 he participated in a pilgrimage to Rome for the third centennial of the death of Aloysius Gonzaga and later on 4 February 1892 issued another pastoral letter on the subject of Christian education. Bishop Marello issued another one on 25 January 1893 regarding the profession of faith. From 14‚Äì28 February 1893 he went to Rome to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Pope Leo XIII's episcopal consecration though on 23 February made a detour to Naples to visit the Pompeii shrine. He issued another pastoral letter on catechism on 20 January 1894 and a final one on 8 February 1895 regarding missions and the propagation of the faith. =Death= Marello travelled to Savona, arriving on 26 May, to participate in a celebration of the third centennial of Philip Neri. He died of a cerebral hemorrhage on 30 May 1895. Marello was due to leave a week after the centennial celebration, but wanted to offer his respects to Bishop Giuseppe Boraggini of the diocese of Savona (1879‚Äì1897), who was not there, and so Marello decided to stay longer in the town until Boraggini's return; this was on 27 May 1895, after he celebrated what would be his final Mass. Marello first went on a Marian pilgrimage in the town and then called on the bishop that evening; he was exhausted but accepted a dinner invitation. But as the bishop showed him the room where Pope Pius VII was once confined in he fainted and was rushed to a bed. The illness did not seem at all serious, so his aide telegrammed the Acqui diocese vicar-general to give word the illness would keep the bishop out of his see for a little while. But his acute headaches caused even the slightest noise to torment him. On 28 May his two doctors thought they saw an improvement that indicated he might soon be able to leave, but the bishop's condition deteriorated on 29 May, and grew worse around 4:30pm on 30 May, when he managed with difficulty to utter a few garbled and incoherent words. The cerebral hemorrhage claimed his life at 6:00pm on 30 May. His funeral was celebrated on 1 June. Leo XIII said of his death at a general audience in Rome in 1891: \\"he was a gem among bishops\\". His remains were exhumed and relocated to his order's motherhouse on 30 June 1923. His order received diocesan approval on 18 March 1901 and papal approval from Pope Pius X on 11 April 1909. Parish The first parish church named after Giuseppe Marello was dedicated in Granite Bay, California, in the United States of America on 22 October 2011 at a celebration presided over by Bishop Jaime Soto along with the parish pastor Arnold Ortiz, . Sainthood The informative process for beatification opened in the Acqui diocese on 23 November 1924 and it concluded in April 1928 while another informative process was opened in Asti from 22 December 1924 and concluded in April 1928 much like the Acqui process; his spiritual writings and other collections received theological approval on 12 May 1937 and a supplementary process was held in Acqui from 1941 to 1942. The formal introduction to the cause came under Pope Pius XII on 28 May 1948 and Marello became titled as a Servant of God. An apostolic process was later held from 10 October 1948 to 21 April 1951 while the Congregation for Rites validated all previous processes in Rome on 17 March 1954. The Congregation for the Causes of Saints (C.C.S.) and their consultants met and approved the cause on 25 October 1977. The confirmation of Marello's model life of heroic virtue allowed for Pope Paul VI to title the late bishop as Venerable on 12 May 1978. For Marello to be beatified one miracle needed to be approved - a healing that science could not explain. One such case was investigated in the diocese of its origin and it later received C.C.S. validation prior to a panel of medical experts approving it on 17 December 1992. Theologians concurred with the verdict on 19 February 1993 as did the C.C.S. themselves on 16 March 1993. Pope John Paul II approved the miracle on 2 April 1993 and presided over Marello's beatification in Asti on 26 September 1993. The miracle in question was the 1944 cure of the seminarian Aldo Falconetti who suffered from tubercular meningitis. The second miracle that was investigated took place in Peru and was the simultaneous healing of the children Alfredo and Isilia Ch√°vez Le√≥n who were both cured from bronchopneumonia. The C.C.S. validated the diocesan process on 12 November 1999 and a medical panel of experts approved it on 13 April 2000; theologians also approved it on 3 July 2000 as did the C.C.S. on 20 November 2000. John Paul II issued his final approval to this miracle on 18 December 2000 and in a 13 March 2001 consistory scheduled the date. John Paul II canonized Marello in Saint Peter's Square on 25 November 2001. References Books * Cartone, Giovanni Battista. Brevi memorie della vita di mons.

He was the first voice heard on BBC Television at its inception on 2 November 1936, and also made the first announcement on Associated-Rediffusion, the first ITV company, on 22 September 1955. His voice was perhaps most recognised, however, from his long association with British Movietone News, for whose newsreels he commentated during the Second World War and for many years afterwards. Early life Born in Edinburgh, Scotland, Mitchell's parents separated while he was a child. He was brought up by the novelist W. J. Locke and his wife, after his own mother went to America during the early years of the First World War and was unable to return. Mitchell was educated at the King's School, Canterbury. Later, he was prevented from joining the Royal Navy by ill health, which also prevented him from serving in the Second World War. He began as a stage and film actor, but suffered from multiple injuries in a road accident, which kept him out of work for over a year, as the play he was appearing in was about to transfer to the West End. Career After a brief period working as a trainee stockbroker, Mitchell secured small roles in stage productions. He had no dramatic training, but secured roles with the aid of his assets - notably good looks and a rich voice. He toured Britain with the Art League for two years, from 1923, and subsequently appeared in London West End productions. However, just as Edgar Wallace's Flying Squad, in which he had appeared on tour, was about to move to the West End, Mitchell suffered multiple injuries in a motorcycle accident. He was unable to work for one year. Later, he returned to theatre work, having had plastic surgery to his face - as well having his jaw rebuilt. Television career He began appearing on BBC Radio in 1932 and joined the Corporation's staff in 1934, working as a general announcer and a producer of variety programmes. In 1936 he became one of the three announcers, chosen from 600 applicants, for the BBC's fledgling Television Service, along with Jasmine Bligh and Elizabeth Cowell, which was then available only in London. He also conducted interviews for the magazine programme Picture Page. During World War II he provided the commentary for the Movietone News and appeared as himself in the comedy film The Black Sheep of Whitehall in which comedian Will Hay drives him to a nervous breakdown. In 1946, suspecting that commercial broadcasting would eventually be allowed in the United Kingdom, he travelled to the United States and gained experience of the methods of publicity used there. In the post-war years he had a stint as Sir Alexander Korda's director of publicity, but was mainly a freelance writer, commentator and producer. In 1955 he joined Associated-Rediffusion, where he became senior announcer, and was also in charge of talks and as chairman of discussion programmes. He became freelance again in 1958. Much of his later work was on programmes concerning the early days of British television, such as a celebration of 25 years of BBC TV which he jointly narrated with Richard Dimbleby in 1961, and a 40th anniversary documentary in 1976. He also presented the nostalgic Tyne Tees Television series Those Wonderful TV Times (1976‚Äì1978). Mitchell's biography Leslie Mitchell Reporting... was published in 1981. He was married twice. He died in London, at the age of 80 after years of ill health.

During this period, she kept a private journal which provides a unique picture of Mahler's personal, professional and creative life during and just after his thirties, including an exclusive preview of the structure, form, and content of his third symphony. Biography Bauer-Lechner was the eldest child of five children (four girls and a boy) born to the Viennese bookshop owner and publisher Rudolf Lechner (1822-1895) and his wife Julie, n√©e von Winiwarter (1831-1905). She was educated privately, and from 1866 to 1872 she and her sister Ellen (28 July 1859 - 24 March 1940) studied at the Vienna Conservatory. Both sisters graduated on 25 July 1872 with a second prize (cf. Neue Freie Presse, Vienna, 28.7.1872, p. 7). Natalie was only 14 years old. In light of what happened three years later (her sudden marriage and becoming the stepmother of three children) it is difficult to see how she would find time to take part in the orchestral rehearsals at the Conservatoire during Mahler's student years from 1875-1878, as Bauer-Lechner later claims in her memoirs on Mahler. However, from various press notices in the Viennese dailies it was clearly her sister Ellen (or Helene) who frequently appeared on such occasions, and also in chamber music concerts with director Joseph Hellmesberger Sr. In 1910 Ellen Schlenk-Lechner formed her own short-lived string quartet with three males. Already in 1883 she had published a Polonaise in D Major Op. 1, for violin and piano. =Marriage and divorce= Most surprisingly and inexplicably, Natalie, only 17¬Ω years old, married in Vienna on 27 December 1875 the 39-year-old widower, Professor, Dr. ph. Alexander Bauer (1836-1921), whose first wife (Emilie, born Russell) had died from pneumonia on 22 March 1874, only one day after she had given birth to her third daughter (cf. Wiener Zeitung, 26.3.1874, p. 8). The two other children were eleven and eight years old, respectively. It has therefore been speculated by Danish Mahler-scholar, Knud Martner, that the last-born daughter, christened in a Protestant Church (though both parents were catholics), on 7 April 1874 and named Minnie Emilie Forster Bauer (she died on 31 July 1956), was in fact the illegitimate child of young Natalie. (By comparing photographs of Bauer-Lechner and the young Minnie Bauer, their features look strikingly similar, and she looks quite different from her two older sisters.) Her marriage, however, childless as it appears to have been, was dissolved ten years later, on 19 June 1885. Nothing is known about Bauer- Lechner's life between 1885 and 1890. Apparently she did not take an active part in the Viennese musical life during this period, at least not according to the daily newspapers. Not even her whereabouts is known. =The Soldat- Roeger String Quartet= In March 1895 Bauer-Lechner became the violist of the newly formed all-female Soldat-Roeger String Quartet, whose leader was the Joachim-pupil Maria Soldat-Roeger. The Quartet gave each year three concerts in Vienna (in all 51 concerts between 1895 and 1913), and it also toured in Austria-Hungary, Germany, France, England and other European countries. After eighteen years the Quartet was finally dissolved in March 1913. Between 1909 and 1912 Natalie Bauer-Lechner arranged four solo concerts in Vienna and appeared from time to time as soloist in various German cities. As a trained professional musician, Bauer-Lechner grasped the technical and aesthetic content of Mahler's conversation. She noted many of his statements about music, literature, philosophy and life at some length and apparently verbatim. =Later years= In her later years, Bauer-Lechner became an outspoken feminist, and in 1918 she allegedly published an article on the war and the need for female suffrage, which led to her arrest and imprisonment. The article in question has never been traced. Her health subsequently collapsed, and she died in Vienna in poverty, only a few months after her former husband. =Erinnerungen an Gustav Mahler= The publication history of her principal work is complicated. The source is a bulky collection of notes entitled Mahleriana, apparently deriving from some thirty diaries which no longer exist. During her life, brief extracts were published in two Viennese journals: anonymously in Der Merker (March 1912, pp. 182-88), and under her own name in Musikbl√§tter des Anbruch (1920, pp. 306-9). Erinnerungen an Gustav Mahler was published in January 1923, and represents an edited selection from the available materials ‚Äî as does the later English volume Recollections of Gustav Mahler (1980). The first German edition was republished in Hamburg 1984 (slightly altered and with additional materials, edited by Herbert Killian (Vienna), and with footnotes and commentaries by Knud Martner (Copenhagen). Recently owned by the late Mahler-scholar Henry-Louis de La Grange, the Mahleriana manuscript is not intact: numerous pages have been torn out by unknown hands, and there is no indication of what they might have contained. During her life, Natalie Bauer-Lechner was in the habit of lending her manuscript to friends and acquaintances (E.H. Gombrich reports that his parents had it in their possession for some time), and it is presumably this practice that allowed material to be removed. A collection of notes recording conversations with Mahler's long-standing friend Siegfried Lipiner is understood to have once existed among her papers. Its current whereabouts are unknown.

Like other mosses, this wetland area supports a variety of plant and animal species, even though it has been subject to certain development and agricultural degradation pressures. For example, the Great Crested Newt was found here prior to the expansion of the town of Portlethen. Many acid loving vegetative species occur in Portlethen Moss, and the habitat is monitored by the Scottish Wildlife Trust. Portlethen Moss is the location of considerable prehistoric, Middle Ages and seventeenth century history, largely due to a ridge near the bog which was the route of early travellers. By at least the Middle Ages this trackway was more formally constructed with raised stonework and called the Causey Mounth. Without this drovers' road, travel through the Portlethen Moss and several nearby bogs would have been impossible between Aberdeen and coastal points to the south. History heather, a common plant on the Portlethen Moss Prehistoric man inhabited the Portlethen Moss area as evidenced by well preserved Iron Age stone circles and other excavated artifacts nearby.Duffy, A 1998 'Charcoal samples', in Rees, T 'Excavation of Cairnwell Ring-Cairn, Portlethen', Proc Soc Antiq Scot, 127, 255-280 Obviously only the outcrops and ridge areas would have been habitable, but the desirability of primitive habitation would have been enhanced by proximity to the sea and natural defensive protection of the moss to impede intruders. From Tacitus accountsTacitus, Accounts of Agricola in Caledonia, ca 42AD of the Roman general Agricola, it is known that the Romans were daunted by Portlethen Moss, Netherley Red Moss, Cookney Moss and other local bogs that hindered travel. This is also evidenced by the Roman Camp of Raedykes having been established immediately south of this cluster of mosses; the Romans not being able to progress further north, turned inland toward Netherley.The Portlethen Moss is near the Grampian Mountains. The ancient Causey Mounth passage specifically connected the Bridge of Dee to the town of Stonehaven. This route was used to access the historic meeting of the Covenanters at Muchalls Castle in the year 1638 AD as they opposed the Bishops of Aberdeen. The route was also that taken by the William Keith, 7th Earl Marischal and James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose when they led a Covenanter army of 9000 men in the biggest battle of the Bishops' Wars in 1639Archibald Watt, Highways and Biways around Kincardineshire, Stonehaven Heritage Society (1985) Further to the east of Portlethen Moss lie three original coastal fishing villages: Findon, Portlethen Village and Downies. In the period 1960 to 2005, Portlethen has developed as a dormitory town to Aberdeen and a location for retail superstores. Conservation status The Portlethen Moss is a recognised nature preserve by the Scottish Wildlife Trust (with designation PLM076) and the Aberdeenshire Council. While peat cutting was conducted in prehistoric and Middle Ages times, there has been no harvesting of peat in the modern era. There is some ongoing loss of moss habitat from cattle grazing, but the most significant threat is from ongoing land development pressure;Fiona Everingham, Portlethen Moss Survey, Scottish Wildlife Trust, 1994 in fact, half of the Portlethen Moss has been lost to urban (low density) land development by the town of Portlethen during the period 1985 to 2005. Trampling is considered an insignificant threat due to the small animal or human presence in the existing nature reserve area; furthermore, cattle grazing, while ongoing, is deemed a much lesser current threat than population expansion pressure. Enrichment (addition of grazing animal manure) is not a major issue due to the low density of animals. As a net result damage to the primordial moss is considered extensive and widespread by the Scottish Wildlife Trust. The raised bog habitat of the Portlethen Moss is also protected by the United Kingdom Biodiversity Action Plan. Topography and meteorology Ruined Episcopal chapel from 18th century south of the Portlethen Moss along the Causey Mounth Portlethen Moss is considered a raised bog, because its general situation is on higher ground, at the edge of the Mounth, a coastal mountain spur of the Grampian Mountains overlooking the North Sea. There are rock outcrops and strewn boulders relict from the glacial age at this site. Elevations within the Portlethen Moss range from approximately 35 to 60 metres above sea level. Formation of this moss has occurred due to extensive sets of depressions in the underlying rock formations of Old Red Sandstone. The entire water composition of the bog thus has been provided by precipitation with no source of surface runoff, since the topography reduces to lower elevations in every direction. Due to the high winds, moderate precipitation and cool temperatures that generally prevail, conditions are favourable for formation of an acid bog, since water stagnates, but eventually evaporates with ensuing acidity enhancement of decaying organic matter. There was virtually no drainage outlet in prehistoric times, and little drainage even in modern times. Evolution of Portlethen Moss Many coastal mosses were initiated by the process of glaciation, which sheared rock formations to a generally level terrain, while also gouging moderate sized craters that would pond. This description fits the fundamental situation of Portlethen Moss, where sphagnum would have flourished over millennia of evaporation, further intensifying the soil acidity, fueled by organic matter decaying, with little drainage outlet. A layer of sphagnum moss would have developed at the benthic level of the bog, and additional sphagnum layers floated in mats atop the bog. At an intermediate level of evolution, thick peat layers formed from decay and carbonisation of the rotting sphagnum. Generations of carex and juncus flourished, leading to further decay of these materials and eventual heightening of the organic mass. Finally, secondary vegetation took root in the spongy sphagnum mats adding greater biomass to the bog. In some cases the heavy saturated organic layers could actually rupture, spilling large volumes of mud and organic debris to surrounding fields, thus enabling a bed for further spatial expansion of the entire bog. Ultimately the colour of the moss waters became blood red in colour, from the successive organic decay and stagnation. Only in times associated with cattle grazing and significant human presence (probably the late Iron Age), would this process reverse and the bog reduce in size. Vegetation A wide variety of sphagnum, sedges, rushes and other characteristic bog species inhabit Portlethen Moss. Sometimes insectivorous plants reside in mosses, since the soils are generally nutrient poor. The heath also serves as a food source for area roe deer, while Corydalis is an attractive host for numerous butterfly larvae. Representative plant species found in this nature reserve include: Erica tetralix, a wildflower found on the Portlethen Moss Insectivorous sundew plants are found at Portlethen Moss Relation to other mosses There are numerous mosses or bog habitats in Scotland, many of them situated also in Aberdeenshire, including the Cookney Moss, Leuchar Moss and Red Moss of Netherley nearby. There are also many other shires within Scotland that contain mosses such as Fife, Angus, Morayshire and Lanarkshire. Some of these are lowland bogs and others, like Portlethen Moss, are raised bogs. There are other similar acidic peat bogs in the northern part of North America, Russia and northern Europe, but in those locations they are usually called \\"bogs\\".

She first appeared in Robin vol. 2, #121 (February 2004) and was created by Bill Willingham and Rick Mays. Fictional character biography Darla Aquista is the daughter of a Gotham Mafia boss, Henry Aquista, and disapproves of his criminal background. She first appeared as Tim Drake was trying to get out of school on his first day as a junior at Louis E. Grieve Memorial High School. Since her jock friends intimidate Tim's only friend at the school, Bernard, he walks up to them and offers for them to beat him up so that his friend can get a free chance to talk to her. Tim wins the kids over as friends, they go to get something to eat, and when Bernard takes his chance to talk to Darla, she shows interest in Tim. The next time she appears, she is arguing with her father, Henry Aquista. She thinks that Tim is afraid to ask her out because of his involvement with the Gotham Mafia. Henry receives a telephone call from Johnny Warlock, the mobster/sorcerer, asking him to unleash a crime wave in the city to draw out Robin. Shortly after this, Tim's father forces him to stop being Robin. Meanwhile, someone known as the Scarab is scouring the city looking for Robin. As Spoiler is monitoring Tim in his new life at school, she sees Darla kissing him and gets angry, running away. Tim tells Darla that he is in a relationship with Stephanie, she gets angry, and walks away crying, thinking that he does not like her. When the Batman storyline \\"War Games\\" starts, a rival gang attacks Darla's car and pulls her out of it. Tim saves her and sends her off towards a group of kids as he takes care of the remaining gang members. Once everyone is inside the school, a bullet from an unknown assailant kills Darla. =Warlock's Daughter= Henry Aquista travels the world with his daughter's corpse, looking for a way to bring her back to life, and eventually comes back to Johnny Warlock, who he finds overseas. Johnny trades Henry's life for Darla's. When she climbs out of the casket, she is reborn as Warlock's Daughter.Robin #137 (June 2005) She next appears in an airport in Istanbul preparing to fly to Gotham. Shortly after, we see Bernard, Tim's friend, driving his car, which lifts off the ground. It is Warlock's Daughter, looking for Tim Drake, levitating the vehicle. She reveals that she now uses the name Laura Fell and she needs to find Tim because she does not really know if she should be a superhero or a villain. When Laura finds Tim, she tells him that she can be with him once she pays off a debt by killing Robin. Tim arranges for Superboy to pose as Robin so that he can fool Laura into thinking that she has killed him. \\"Robin\\" shows up, Laura transforms into Warlock's Daughter, and attacks Superboy. Superboy survives, but suffers serious injury due to his vulnerability to magic. Laura appears a week later in Bl√ºdhaven in The OMAC Project. The city is under siege from OMACs and Johnny Warlock comes to take her to safety. Robin arrives with the Veteran's team and Johnny attacks Laura for failing to kill him. Robin stands Johnny down due to Johnny's belief that Robin is too powerful for him.Robin #143 (December 2005) After the standoff, Robin finds that Laura is gone. Along with the Shadowpact, Robin confronts escaped villains throughout Bl√ºdhaven, trying to find Laura.Robin #144 (January 2006) When they eventually find her, he suggests that she join the Shadowpact and promises to go tell Tim Drake what she plans to do. Another group of escaped villains then attacks them. She defeats the villains surrounding them by unleashing a great deal of power. Robin leaves her alone after she saves him from drowning by the use of CPR.Robin #145 (February 2006) =Shadowpact= Shortly following the events of Infinite Crisis, the Shadowpact is trapped behind a mystic barrier after defeating a group of magic-based enemies. Although they are able to destroy the barrier, the group \\"loses a year\\" as a price. They find that while only a few days had passed for them, for the rest of the world a year has passed. One of their first stops afterwards is the Dark Tower of Joshua Coldrake Master of Anti-Magic, where they had previously imprisoned Johnny Warlock and Laura Fell. Laura had served her sentenced to a year in the jail and the delay left her stranded for two weeks after her sentence had finished. The Shadowpact promise they would bring her back to Earth very soon.Shadowpact #5 (November 2006) Ragman and Nightshade retrieve Laura Fell from the Dark Tower (two weeks later) and convey her to the Oblivion Bar.Shadowpact #10 (April 2007) At the end of the issue, she temporarily joins the Shadowpact alongside two other patrons of the Bar on a mission to retrieve Blue Devil's trident from Hell. They are successful, though Laura is almost torn in two by Etrigan the Demon. She is saved when her ally uses his magical pistols to turn the demon into stone.Shadowpact #11 (May 2007) In Shadowpact #17, Enchantress grows angry at Laura for acting recklessly in a battle with zombies. This is especially dangerous because of the new rules of magic set into place after \\"Day of Vengeance\\". Nightmaster sides with the Enchantress, but assigns her to train the new recruit in combat magic. Laura's training veers from magical spells to practical knowledge as she has to understand basic physics in order to magically manipulate them.

Her principal area of operation is the Bristol Channel, although she also operates day excursions to other parts of the United Kingdom. The Balmoral is included on the National Historic Ships register as part of the National Historic Fleet. History Balmoral was built as a ferry by John I. Thornycroft & Company at Woolston in 1949, for the Southampton, Isle of Wight and South of England Royal Mail Steam Packet Co. Limited, more normally known as the Red Funnel line. As built, Balmoral could carry up to 10 cars on her aft car deck, and she normally operated on her owner's ferry service from Southampton on the English mainland to Cowes on the Isle of Wight. From her introduction she also occasionally performed excursion duties, but as dedicated car ferries were introduced to her main route, her role became more focussed on offering coastal cruises around the South Coast. Red Funnel ceased operating excursions in 1968, after which Balmoral was acquired by P & A Campbell. She moved to the Bristol Channel, where she became part of P&A; Campbell's White Funnel Fleet until 1980, by which time she was the last working member of the fleet. Balmoral moved to Dundee to become a floating restaurant. This was unsuccessful and the ship was placed for sale again. Preservation At this time the Waverley Steam Navigation Co. Ltd were looking for another vessel to operate alongside the world's last seagoing paddle steamer, . Balmoral was purchased by them and subjected to a major refit. As part of this, her car deck was enclosed to form an area that is now in use as a dining saloon.Adams, R. B. (1986). Red Funnel and Before. Kingfisher Publications. Balmoral returned to the Bristol Channel in 1986. Since then the ship has operated a summer season of excursions around the Bristol Channel, with visits to most areas of the UK. In winter 2002, Balmoral received new engines, her original twin 6-cyl Newbury Sirron diesels were removed and replaced with a pair of Danish-built Grenaa diesel engines. This work was partially funded by a grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund. Balmoral can now accommodate up to 800 passengers and has a self-service restaurant on board, along with two licensed bars, a heated observation lounge and a souvenir shop. Refit In December 2012 Waverley Excursions and Waverley Steam Navigation announced that Balmoral would not be sailing in 2013. The ship's operation has been hampered increasingly in recent years by extreme weather conditions. In 2015, ownership of MV Balmoral was transferred to a new registered charity MV Balmoral Fund Limited, and she is now operated by their subsidiary, White Funnel Ltd.White Funnel Ltd. Following a refit costing over ¬£300,000 and with help from a Coastal Communities Fund Grant, Balmoral started public sailing again on 19 June 2015. It was announced in December 2017 that she will not be sailing in 2018 as she requires major hull plating work. In popular culture Balmoral appeared in the 2018 film The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society. Balmoral was also hired in the 2017 drama Another Mother's Son, featuring Ronan Keating and John Hannah She also features in the 2019 film Stan and Ollie, a biographical comedy-drama based on the lives of the comedy double act Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy. In Television, she featured in BBC One's Easter 1916: The Enemy Files, starring Michael Portillo.

He was recognized as \\"Righteous Among the Nations\\" by Yad Vashem on February 10, 1983, for rescuing countless Jews from the Holocaust. Pankiewicz studied at the Jagiellonian University in Krak√≥w. In 1933, he took over the proprietorship of the Under the Eagle Pharmacy founded in 1910 by his father Jozef.Museum of National Remembrance at \\"Under the Eagle Pharmacy\\" The pharmacy was situated on Plac Zgody (formerly Ma≈Çy Rynek square) in Krak√≥w's Podg√≥rze district. Its prewar clientele included both Gentile Poles and Jews.  In the Krak√≥w Ghetto  Pankiewicz in his Pharmacy around 1941 Under the German Nazi occupation of Poland during World War II, Podg√≥rze district was closed off in March 1941 as a ghetto for local area Jewry. Within the walls of the Krak√≥w Ghetto there were four prewar pharmacies owned by non-Jews. Pankiewicz was the only proprietor to decline the German offer of relocating to the gentile (non- Jewish) side of the city. He was given permission to continue operating his establishment as the only pharmacy in the Ghetto, and reside on the premises.David M. Crowe, The Holocaust: Roots, History, and Aftermath. Published by Westview Press. Page 180. His staff were given passage permits to enter and exit the ghetto for work. The often-scarce medications and pharmaceutical products supplied to the ghetto's residents, often free of charge, substantially improved their quality of life. In effect, apart from health care considerations, they contributed to survival itself. In his published testimonies, Pankiewicz makes particular mention of hair dyes used by those disguising their identities and tranquilizers given to fretful children required to keep silent during Gestapo raids. The pharmacy became a meeting place for the ghetto's intelligentsia, and a hub of underground activity. Pankiewicz and his staff, Irena Drozdzikowska, Helena Krywaniuk, and Aurelia Danek, risked their lives to undertake numerous clandestine operations: smuggling food and information, and offering shelter on the premises for Jews facing deportation to the camps.  After World War II  On February 10, 1983, Tadeusz Pankiewicz was awarded recognition as a \\"Righteous Among the Nations\\" for his wartime activities in rescuing Jews. In April of that year, he was present at the inauguration of the national heritage museum housed in the Apteka Pod Or≈Çem building. Tadeusz Pankiewicz died in 1993 and is buried in Krak√≥w's Rakowicki Cemetery. In April 1983, the \\"Pod Orlem\\" pharmacy, located at No.18 Plac Bohater√≥w Ghetta (Ghetto Heroes Plaza, renamed), opened its doors as the Museum of National Remembrance, featuring the history of Krak√≥w Jewry with special focus on the ghetto period. In 2003, it became affiliated with the municipal Historical Museum of Krak√≥w. The wartime activities of Pankiewicz and his staff are featured in an exhibition on the history of the Jewish ghetto in Krak√≥w. The pharmacy was featured in the Academy Award-winning film, Schindler's List. The film's director Steven Spielberg donated $40,000 for the building's preservation, for which he was honored by the city of Krak√≥w with its prestigious \\"Patron of Culture\\" award for the year 2004.

In November 2006, Frito-Lay announced plans to release Kurkure to American markets sometime in 2007. This decision was made after analysts showed increasing interest in Indian spices in the region. Also, the introduction in other markets with a non-resident Indian population such as the UK. As of 2013, Kurkure is available in Western Canada. As of 2010, Kurkure is available in Eastern Canada.  Controversy  In July 2018, it was reported that PepsiCo had been granted an order by the Delhi High Court, ordering Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube to remove or block various \\"disparaging and defamatory\\" posts perpetuating a false rumour that Kurkure products contain plastics. The rumour had frequently been spread via videos depicting the snacks being flammable, even though this is based primarily on their starch content. PepsiCo faced criticism over the move, as it also included the geoblocking of Twitter posts that were clearly satirizing the controversy and order.

It was his d√©but novel. The novel is the first in Calders 'Dead' trilogy, and is followed by the novels Dead Boys and Dead Things. Background  The novel was written in 1990, soon after Richard Calder had taken up residence in Thailand. He was living in Nongkhai, a small town on the Mekong River, overlooking Laos. He was also making frequent trips to Bangkok. Nongkhai, Bangkok and London are the story's most important locales.SFX interview Dead Girls is a science fiction novel set in the year 2071 telling the tale of a virus that turns pubescent girls into vampiric gynoid dolls called Lilim, and the doomed love affair between 15-year-old Ignatz Zwakh and a Lilim assassin called Primavera. The idea for the quantum clockwork Cartier dolls comes from the story of Coppellia, a mechanical doll in one of the Tales from Hoffmann. Richard Calder cites Jacques Offenbach's opera version of the tale in which Hoffmann falls in love with Olympia as being particularly influential.His Own Aesthetic Richard Calder interviewed by Charles Rudkin Interzone #170 August 2001, page 25 Another influence was the doll sculptures of Hans Bellmer Plot ;Road to Nowhere Ignatz Zwakh, former escort of assassin Primavera Bobinski, is tracked down in Thailand by the half-robotic Pikadon Twins, with a demand from Primavera's half-robot boss Madame Kito that Ignatz return to the Big Weird to work with Primavera. Primavera is a Lilim - a vampiric living dead girl. ;Wine and Roses Ignatz returns to Nana, Bangkok, and is reunited with Primavera. They go to a restaurant that uses gynoids to mimic the English vogue of killing Lilim. The Cartier automata were invented by a Dr Toxicophilous with robotic consciousness that harnessed 'quantum magic', and this quantum-mechanical seat of consciousness is situated in the womb of their descendants, the Lilim. The pair are in the restaurant on a job from Madame Kito, but while Primavera is engaged in assassinating one of Kito's rivals Ignatz is rendered unconscious. ;Beata Beatrix Ignatz and Primavera, now captured and rendered unconscious with a special girdle around her umbilicus (navel), are taken by Jack Morgenstern to the American Embassy, where they are locked up. ;Black Spring Jack Morgenstern reveals that the British government want Primavera and Ignatz returned to them, and Kito has betrayed them to the Americans. Morgenstern questions Ignatz regarding the amount of Lilim escapees from the supposedly quarantined London, but gets no response to his theory that one of the surviving original Cartier dolls called Titania is organising the breakouts. Primavera uses her quantum magic to telepathically induce her guard to release her from her umbilicus girdle, then physically smashes through the wall of her prison, allowing herself and Ignatz to escape by jumping into the river below. Due to the umbilical girdle Primavera's quantum matrix has been infected by hostile nanobots which are inhibiting her full use of quantum magic and are slowly destroying her. Primavera believes that Kito has been blackmailed into betraying them. Primavera and Ignatz leave Nana by boat. Ignatz apologises for running away from Primavera. Ignatz and Primavera make love, Ignatz requiring medical attention for blood loss afterwards. Primavera determines to confront Kito in order to be cured of the nanovirus. Primavera orders new clothes for herself and Ignatz made from living dermoplastic. ;Going to a Go-Go Primavera and Ignatz return to Nana, gaining entrance to Kito's penthouse in the Grace Hotel, only to be captured by Kito and her robot guards. Primavera begs Kito to remove the nanovirus that is killing her. She reveals that her telepathic dreams while captured told her that Kito is being blackmailed by Jack Morgenstern: years ago during a trade war Cartier infected Kito's fake dolls with an impotence STD and in response Kito sent her own virus to infect the genuine Cartier dolls in Paris - a virus that Morgenstern thinks responsible for the doll plague. Primavera says she can disprove this by telling Kito of Titania and how she and Ignatz escaped England... ;Westward Ho Vlad Constantinescu and the Human Front win the British election, and the systematic execution of Lilim by impalement through the umbilicus begins. Primavera and Ignatz decide to runaway together, and flee through the flooded London Underground tunnels to hide in the West End. The pair are captured by a group of doll-killer paramedics, but are rescued by a pair of Lilim. Primavera and Ignatz are taken to meet Titania - the last of the original infected Cartier dolls and Queen of the Lilim - at her hideout under a Whitechapel warehouse. ;A Fairy Queen While telling her story Primavera passes out, and Kito has her resident research and development technician Spalanzani examine her. The 'magic dust' virus consists of nanomachines that are transforming the Ylem at the heart of her being from a quantum mechanical state to a classical mechanical state, which will render her quantum 'magic' inert. Kito agrees to allow Spalanzani to remove the nanomachines on the condition that Ignatz continues his story... Primavera and Ignatz are led into The Seven Stars - Tatiana's underground palace, where they meet Tatiana and her human consort Peter Gunn. At Tatiana's prompting, Peter tells Primavera and Ignatz their story... ;The Lilim Peter's father (Dr. Toxicophilous) was a quantum engineer, a toy maker who built dolls for Cartier, though with the outbreak of doll plague his services are no longer in demand. Titania, his last and greatest creation, acts as a housemaid at the Gunn family home. Peter and Titania visit The Seven Stars that they are constructing as a private playground and Peter unlocks her matrix with his father's key, but infected with a sickness Titania stays there, and cocoons herself as she begins to transform. Peter's father tells him that the rumor that the doll plague was started by a rivals from the East was a lie, and that it is the result of his own dark childhood dreams subconsciously infecting the quantum structure of the dolls when he created them. ;Unreal City Jack Morgenstern and the Pikadon Twins enter Spalanzani's workshop: having bugged it Morgenstern has heard the whole story. Morgenstern has bought enough shares to depose Kito from her company and place the Pikadon Twins in her place. Morgenstern instructs his men to take Primavera but a green light explodes from her umbilicus and Morgenstern, his men, Ignatz, Kito and Spalanzani are sucked inside Primavera's quantum matrix. Inside the matrix they find themselves in a dream world that is geographically a collision of London and the Big Weird, complete with another copy of Primavera. Primavera is unable to wake herself up and return them to reality, so accompanied by Ignatz and Morgenstern she tries to find Dr Toxicophilous: according to Primavera Toxicophilous is present in all dolls and represents the programme that controls their files - he also has the key to her matrix that can wake her up. Morgenstern tries to convince Primavera that he is actually working with Titania, not against her. The dream city is filled with clones of Primavera, with the nanovirus represented by Jack the Ripper-style figures. Unable to find Dr Toxicophilous Primavera realises she needs to look deeper inside herself: she gazes into her own umbilicus and is sucked through, followed by Ignatz and Morgentren. ;Psychic Surgery Primavera, Ignatz and Morgenstern confront Dr Toxicophilous. Toxicophilous tells Primavera that Titania had betrayed her: thanks to his subconscious corruption of Titania's quantum consciousness he had created a living being with a death wish, and Titania has the ability to instil this death wish in Lilim at will. Titania had been negotiating with Morgenstern over using the Lilim as instruments of US foreign policy to infect and destabilise hostile foreign countries, then cauterize the infection by use of the death wish. Dr. Toxicophilous gives Ignatz the key to Primavera's matrix, he inserts it into her umbilical and the dreamers are returned to the reality of Spalanzani's workshop. Spalanzani is killed when he tries to stop Morgenstern shooting Primavera. Due to them waking up at different times Kito gets a head start on her enemies and traps the Pikadon Twins, while Morgenstern is shot and rendered unconscious. Kito re-hires Primavera and Ignatz to work for her. ;Desperadoes Kito, Primavera and Ignatz find themselves on the run from the Pikadon Twins and Jack Morgenstern. Kito says she can get help from a friend called Mosquito. Having been taken in by Titania Primavera and Ignatz spend time at The Seven Stars, chaperoned by a Lilim called Josephene . Ignatz asks for a view of England beyond that of the quarantined London and Josephene shows him via the visual circuits of a shop-window dummy in Manchester, revealing a nightmare world where the Human Front have replaced the dolls with re-animated human corpses, 'Mememoids' whose brains have been taken over by replicating information patterns transmitted via a comic strip called Cruel Britannia, and castrated policemen with guns as phallic replacements. Following the completion of her transformation and indoctrination Primavera is sent out of England to spread the doll plague through Europe. Together with Ignatz she is led through The Seven Stars to a service tunnel in the Channel Tunnel. Kito takes Primavera and Ignatz to meet Mosquito, an old employee who she had previously used to attempt to spread her virus to the Cartier dolls, to ask for money. Back on the road Ignatz and Primavera are attacked by the Pikadon Twins, and though they manage to kill them they lose Kito in the process. ;Dead Girls The Mekong River Ignatz and Primavera try to escape down the Mekong river, but Primavera collapses as she gives in to Titania's death wish. A hologram of Titania appears and explains to Ignatz that the only way the Lilim can survive is by keeping their numbers under control by culling themselves. Primavera dies. Adaptations Richard Calder and the Filipino artist Leonardo M. Giron have turned Dead Girls into a graphic novel. This was published in 2014. Act 1 - The Last of England was serialised in Murky Depths #9 to #12 and collected in a limited edition full-colour hardback (published January, 2011) by the imprint The House of Murky Depths. Act 2 began in Murky Depths #16 (Summer, 2011). There are no plans to make graphic novels of the rest of the Dead series, but an eight-comic series launched in March 2012 to replace the serialisation that was cut short with the demise of Murky Depths with Issue #18.

H. Ernst (1803) Johannes B√ºckler (c.1778 ‚Äì 21 November 1803) was a German outlaw who orchestrated one of the most famous crime sprees in German history. He has been nicknamed Schinderhannes and Schinnerhannes in German and John the Scorcher, John the Flayer and the Robber of the Rhine in English. He was born at Miehlen, the son of Johann and Anna Maria B√ºckler. He began an apprenticeship to a tanner but turned to petty theft. At 16 he was arrested for stealing some of the skins, but he escaped detention. He then turned to break-ins and armed robbery on both sides of the Rhine, which was the border between France and the Holy Roman Empire. The legend of Schinderhannes truly emerged from his escape from a prison tower in Simmern, a market town in the Hunsr√ºck region of the Rhineland. At the time, the west bank of the Rhine was under French occupation, and the peasantry was happy to celebrate anyone who was able to flout the law. At the end of 1798, B√ºckler had a criminal record that included thefts of at least 40 head of cattle and horses. He was arrested by French gendarmerie and brought before a judge, where he confessed some of his crimes. Imprisoned in a wooden tower in Simmern that most believed to be impenetrable, he used a kitchen knife, smuggled in by a sympathetic guard, and cut a hole in a small window to escape. The prison escape became widely reported, exciting the public and making Schinderhannes a folk hero. The legend of Schinderhannes grew with every new escapade. After things began to get too dangerous for him, Schinderhannes fled across the Rhine and enlisted in the Austrian Army under the assumed name of Jakob Schweikart. He was recognized, however, by a former associate, handed over to the French authorities and imprisoned in a tower of the medieval defensive wall of Mainz (the so-called \\"Holzturm\\"). After his mistress, Juliana Blasius, was threatened with being charged as an accomplice, Schinderhannes testified against his fellow gangsters. Nineteen of his associates were sentenced to death. Despite his cooperation, Schinderhannes was sentenced to death as well. On 21 November 1803 he was guillotined before the gates of Mainz. More than 40,000 spectators witnessed his execution. He remains Germany's most famous outlaw. His legend still attracts a great deal of tourism to the region wherein his gang operated.  Origin  House of Schinderhannes in Miehlen Johannes B√ºckler's oldest known ancestor was Sebastian Bickler, executioner and master tanner of Kirchberg and Koppenstein, who was engaged in the tanner's trade at the mill at Wallenbr√ºck, which had fallen into decay after the Thirty Years' War. According to his son, Hans- Adam, he came from an old family of executioners and tanners. Hans-Adam (also Johann Adam) Bickler (1649‚Äì1720) continued both trades at the Wallenbr√ºck after his certification on 13 November 1679. During the War of the Palatine Succession the French demanded a fee which he could not pay, so he was dismissed in 1693 and replaced by the executioner, Dillendorf, from Corray at Zell on the Moselle. In 1697, after the end of the war, Hans-Adam Bickler was able to return. In 1673, Niclas Bickler, great-grandfather of Johannes B√ºckler, was born on the Wallenbr√ºck as son of Hans-Adam Bickler and his wife Margaretha, daughter of the skinner Coller of Bernkastel. He also stayed on site for the time being, but left the family in 1703 and went to Hilscheid near Thalfang. After 1708, the Anterior County of Sponheim had been divided between Baden and Electoral Palatinate and the Wallenbr√ºck had become the border town of Baden, more and more criminals and others sought by the courts sought refuge there. After the death of his father and serious inheritance disputes between him and his stepmother Eva Marie, Niclas Bickler succeeded in obtaining the deed of inheritance. However, one and a half years later, on 16 February 1722, the Kirchberg upper office reversed the decision; Eva Bickler now received the deed. As a result of further ruinous inheritance disputes, the Wallenbr√ºck had to be auctioned on 31 August 1733. It went to the Naumburg executioner, Matthias Nagel, who passed it on to his son-in-law, Johann Leonard North, in 1738, who in turn let Johannes Bickler manage it. Otto Philipp Bickler, Niclas' son, became a executioner in Wartelstein, today's Schloss Wartenstein near Kirn. In this position he succeeded Mattias Nagel, a grandson of Matthias Nagel. Bickler went to Merzweiler in 1754. Later Johannes B√ºckler, Schinderhannes, learned the skinner's craft from Mattias Nagel. Nagel, who was also known as a wound healer, treated B√ºckler medically after attacks and outbreaks. Johannes B√ºckler's father, Johannes Bickler, was born in Merzweiler. He married Anna Maria Schmidt in Miehlen. B√ºckler's parents fled Miehlen in 1783 because of a forest crime and a laundry theft by his mother. In 1784, his father was recruited for six years by the Imperial Army. He served in Moravia, deserted in 1789 and returned first to his birthplace of Merzweiler.  Life  = Black Peter = One of Schinderhannes' accomplices was Peter Petri, nicknamed \\"Black Peter\\", who is described as a black-haired man who was as gentle as a lamb when sober, but became violent when drunk and no longer in control of himself. Polecat Jacob (Iltis-Jacob) and Reidenbach had already been his accomplices in numerous raids in the Hunsr√ºck. When Petri and Polecat were on their way home from a christening with their wife, Petri and Jacob's wife remained a little behind and crawled into the grass. The passing Jewish cattle dealer, Simon Seligmann, from Seibersbach discovered the lovers and betrayed them to the aforementioned Polecat. He came back and strangled his unfaithful wife. Petri, however, could not forgive the Jew who had caught him at his tryst and betrayed him to Polecat. A little later he was with Johannes B√ºckler in the Thiergarten forester's lodge at Argenthal and celebrated with him and friends where they had ordered Jewish bankers to make music. Meanwhile Seligmann passed the house with a cow and was seen by Petri. Petri asked B√ºckler to follow him. In pairs they attacked the Jew and stabbed him repeatedly to death before plundering his body. Whether Johannes B√ºckler also murdered Seligmann could not be proven.Nothing but a robber. In: Die Zeit. 13 November 2003. A juridical review of all the records has shown that an accusation of murder could not be upheld against him. = Placken-Klos = At first, the gang was mainly up to no good in the then cantons of Kirn, (Bad) Sobernheim, Herrstein, Rhaunen, Kirchberg, Simmern and Stromberg. Later, its field of activity shifted to areas beyond Nahe. In the canton of Kirn the robbers often stayed in at Hahnenbach and Schneppenbach. In Hahnenbach, Johannes B√ºckler had accommodated his lover, Elise Werner, with a \\"dirty old woman\\", Anne Marie Frey. Elise Sch√§fer from Faid lived in Schneppenbach with her 14-year-old daughter \\"Amie\\". This girl is described as intelligent, \\"not prim and fleshy to feel\\" and was courted by B√ºckler and Seibert along with some others. \\"Placken-Klos\\", who had given his Elise to Johannes B√ºckler, became jealous about it. One day Placken-Klos came into the house of Elise and Amie and demanded the surrender of Amie to his \\"constant company\\". Amie, who was in love with Johannes B√ºckler, was able to defend herself successfully against this request, but had to hand over her clothes to Placken-Klos, who was looking for a way out. A little later B√ºckler appeared with Seibert, Fink and other journeymen with Elise and Amie and learned what had happened. They decided to visit the robber, and finally found him at the Baldenauer Hof near Morscheid, where he was killed by Seibert and B√ºckler on 22 December 1797. The murder of Placken-Klos by Johannes B√ºckler could also not be proven beyond doubt. = Imprisonment = By the time of his arrest in Simmern in February 1799, B√ºckler had committed more than 40 cattle and horse thefts. Johannes B√ºckler returned to Wallenbr√ºck around 1800, where he tried to steal horses from the mill now run by Conrad Weyrich. Another longer residence of B√ºckler was the settlement near Dickenschied Scheidbach. The Schinderhannes Tower in Simmern At the end of February 1799, the Kirn gendarmerie were able to capture Johannes B√ºckler in Schneppenbach by surrounding the house of Elise and Amie and surprising him in his sleep. He was brought before the magistrate in Kirn, where he confessed to some of his crimes. With his companion, Johann M√ºller, he was taken to the prison tower in Simmern, where Elise was able to visit him twice. With the help of his friend, Philipp Arnold, who sat in the guard room, Johannes B√ºckler was able to flee in the night of 19/20 August 1799. The dungeon in the tower was in its round basement, which could only be reached from above through a hatch through which the prisoners were lowered and raised. The prisoners were also supplied through this hole with the most essential food. However, B√ºckler was not kept in this dungeon, but in a prison cell above it. B√ºckler cut through the door boards with a secretly hidden knife and glued them back together again with chewed bread as glue. When a good opportunity arose, he left the cell, broke through a kitchen window loosely barred with iron, and from there jumped from the first floor into the moat of the city wall, dislocating his leg or breaking his fibula. = Crime spree = After his escape from the tower at Simmern, B√ºckler turned mainly to robbery and extortion, because horse theft had become too burdensome and not profitable enough. He committed these acts with an average number of five accomplices. A large proportion of his criminal activity was directed against Jews, perhaps because attacks on Jews would result in negligible interference from the part rest of the population. Locations: * Around 1800 Johannes B√ºckler moved his \\"residence\\" to the semi-ruined castle of Schmidtburg in the Hahnenbach valley and used Schloss Kallenfels above Kirn, as an alternative base and observation post. The Hahnenbach valley between Schneppenbach and Bundenbach :The local population were aware of the presence of the robbers in the whole of Kallenfels, Hahnenbach, Sonnschied and Griebelschied, but nothing was revealed to the authorities. In Griebelschied a so-called 'robber ball' was celebrated in August, where the robbers enjoyed the company of the women of the village. Perhaps it was a result of this cockiness that the gang, which had long been a focus of police interest, was able to be located. Numerous robberies followed, mainly against Jews. The robbers became more audacious and moved beyond their home area into the Saar area. * In Wickenhof, after an armed street robbery (on 18 December 1799), Johannes B√ºckler got to know a woman called Julchen around Easter 1800. Julchen later became his wife and companion, and also took part in his raids. B√ºckler had already had eight lovers before Julchen, four of whom are known by name: Elise Werner, Buzliese- Amie, Katharina Pfeiffer and Margarete Blasius. * In Waldb√∂ckelheim Johannes B√ºckler attached a coach on 5 January 1800. * On 11 January 1800, Johannes B√ºckler committed a robbery in Otzweiler and then fled to the east bank of the Rhine. B√ºckler divided the booty from this and another robbery at Koppenstein Castle. * On the hill ridge of Winterhauch south of Idar-Oberstein, Johannes B√ºckler committed highway robbery on 12 March 1800. * On 16 March 1800, he robbed several Jewish merchants in Neubr√ºcke. * On 27 March 1800, B√ºckler committed an armed robbery in Steinhardt which resulted in a fatality. * On 24 August 1800 he extorted protection money from the industrialist, Johann Ferdinand Stumm (1764‚Äì1839), one of the founders of the Gebr√ºder Stumm family business. This was followed by the same offence against all the Hottenbach Jews. In addition, B√ºckler robbed Wolff Wiener in Hottenbach. * In November 1800 an attempt was made in Gr√§fenbacherh√ºtte to extort more protection money. * On 10 January 1801, B√ºckler attacked the post office in W√ºrges (at Bad Camberg in Taunus). The Dutch Gang was also involved in this raid. * On 28 January 1801, he committed a burglary in Merxheim (Near). * On 15 April 1801, Johannes B√ºckler attacked a house in Laufersweiler during the night. The booty was taken into the tunnels of Lemberg near Oberhausen an der Nahe and divided up. The Oberhausen Ferry House (Oberhausener F√§hrhaus) became an important base for B√ºckler. * On 25 May 1801, B√ºckler's gang got involved in a brawl with soldiers in Klein-Rohrheim (Hesse), in which Corporal Franz Kleb was shot. * * On 4 September 1801, the Jewish merchant, Mendel L√∂w, was robbed and murdered in S√∂tern. * On 15 September 1801, there was a robbery in Staudernheim, then another in Waldgrehweiler. For the first time there was resistance from the population. * On 15 November 1801, B√ºckler's band of robbers was forced to flee after a raid. * On 14 January 1802, they again extorted protection money, this time in Merxheim, and then again on 12 February in Neudorferhof near Lettweiler and on 20 March at Montforter Hof. This was B√ºckler's last documented crime. * On 31 May 1802, Johannes B√ºckler was arrested at Wolfenhausen in the Taunus. Among his companions were: * Martin Schmitt, a Hungarian deserter whom he bound to himself by assigning his lover Elise to him. Schmitt was soon arrested in the canton of Zell and sentenced to six years imprisonment. * Carl Benzel from Reichenbach near Baumholder, a violin player who was active at festivals, church consecrations and in taverns and who also financed his livelihood and love affairs with theft. Benzel, who had enjoyed a good education, distanced himself after the first atrocities of Johannes B√ºckler and hired himself out to the Mainzer Landsturm. After a few weeks, however, he deserted and visited B√ºckler again, who gave him a warm welcome. He remained with B√ºckler until his arrest, but was always plagued by remorse. After Benzel was also captured, he gave his lover Amie to Peter Zughetto. Benzel died on 24 February 1802 in Koblenz under the guillotine. * Christoph Bl√ºmling from Laudert. He was arrested for a theft committed by Johannes B√ºckler and died in prison in Cologne. * Peter Dallheimer from Sonnschied. He was executed in Trier under the guillotine. In the time leading up to his final imprisonment there were several murders which could possibly can be attributed to B√ºckler. But based on the file material known today this was not sufficient to describe Johannes B√ºckler as a murderer. In addition, there was a lack of gang cohernence, to the extent that his accomplices changed almost daily. Although B√ºckler sometimes went around with certain persons for several weeks, again and again he joined other henchmen (or they joined him); however, this cannot be describe as a gang in the legal sense, in which several people agreed to commit crimes for a certain period of time.Extensively examined in M. Scheibe: Die Strafjustiz in Mainz und Frankfurt am Main 1796‚Äì1803 (...). pp. 11 ff, 23 ff. All in all, however, it can be ascertained that, in particular the numerous tramps and vagrants tried to secure a subsistence living by thefts. Short-term associations were the rule. However, B√ºckler had acquired an increasingly important reputation in the course of 1800, so that many people with dubious reputations were happy to join him or even stayed on guard without being asked when he was e.g. in a restaurant. B√ºckler and Juliana Bl√§sius with their child As the new century began, the French police system gradually began to take effect. In 1800, Johannes B√ºckler also came under the lens of law enforcement agencies on a supra-regional level, according to a decree by the General Government Commissioner, Jean-Baptiste-Mo√Øse Jollivet, so that under the pseudonym of Jakob Ofenloch he began a travelling shopkeeper's trade in the lands on the bank of the Rhine. = Arrest and fate = On 31 May 1802, he was tracked down in the eastern Hinter Taunus between Wolfenhausen and Haintchen by the Electorate of Trier's manorial court councillor and official administrator of Limburg a.d. Lahn, Mr. Fuchs, at dawn with troops from Niederselters. When they were still a quarter of an hour away from Wolfenhausen, they saw a person walking out of a cornfield onto the road 300 paces away. The troops felt he was acting oddly and he was immediately arrested. At that time it was not known that the stranger was Schinderhannes. Rather, Johannes B√ºckler had been expelled from Wolfenhausen by a patrol two days earlier and had been picked up again by the same patrol and then arrested. He was led to Wolfenhausen, where the lieutenant and patrol for Wied-Runkel were based. From there he was taken to Runkel. With the statement that he, Jakob Schweikard, as he called himself, wanted to report for military service, he tried to secure his release. He was taken from Runkel to Limburg to Haus R√ºtsche 5, the seat of the recruitment office, under light surveillance. At that time it was still not known that this man was Johannes B√ºckler. The light guard had more to do with his wish of the army service, because many of the volunteers had made off with the hand money. Only in Limburg was he betrayed by a man named Zerfass from the long hedge, today Villmar-Langhecke, and after a short detention in the basement of the recruiting office, under heavy guard, he was transferred to the imperial city of Frankfurt am Main. At that time, B√ºckler's determination to lead a robber's life was wavering. He promised the imperial authorities to provide information about all his crimes as long as he was not extradited to the French authorities who had occupied the Electorate of Trier, west of the Rhine, since 1801. After several thorough interrogations, however, he was handed over to the authorities with Julchen and some accomplices on 16 June 1802 and they were taken to French-occupied Mainz. After being handed over, B√ºckler was imprisoned in the Wooden Tower of Mainz and subjected during the 16-month preliminary investigation by Johann Wilhelm Wernher to several dozen individual interrogations, during which 565 questions were asked. In addition, there were numerous identity parades. The court upheld B√ºckler's plea for a merciful sentence and was thus able to elicit an extensive confession from him. Without incriminating himself with violent offences, he named well over 100 persons who were connected with his crimes. With him, a further 19 accomplices were sentenced to death by a total of 68 defendants.  Trial  The trial began on 24 October 1803 and attracted a large crowd. Three defendants had already died in custody. The reading of the 72-page indictment in German and French took one and a half days. The trial was chaired by Georg Friedrich Rebmann, the president of the Mainz Criminal Court. The trial took place in the then academy hall of the former Electoral Palace in Mainz. 400 witnesses were questioned. The employment of professional judges, officers, interpreters and defence lawyers allows the conclusion to be drawn that, at least in rudimentary terms, there was a safeguarding of the rule of law and the public in today's sense. Between 1803 and 1811, Georg Friedrich von Rebmann was the presiding judge at the Mainz Special Court. After the conclusion of the proceedings there were 20 acquittals, 18 were given prison sentences in chains or were exiled, and 20 were sentenced to death. The accused were charged with various offences, including vagrancy and coercion, attempted burglary and theft, food theft and fraud, cattle theft, burglary, extortion, handling stolen goods, grievous bodily harm resulting in death, murder and robbery.  Execution  Contemporary woodcut of B√ºckler's execution B√ºckler was sentenced to death on the basis of the statutory provision which provided for the death penalty for armed burglaries. The verdict had already been reached before the start of the main trial, since the court had already invited friends and acquaintances to the execution on 21 November 1803 in October.Der Schinderhannes als Medienereignis Johann B√ºckler's father was sentenced to 22 years in chains, but died after a few weeks on 28 December 1803. Julchen Blasius served two years in prison. She gave birth to B√ºckler's son, Franz Wilhelm, before the trial on 1 October 1802. His direct descendants still live in the Taunus today. The sentencing of B√ºckler and 19 of his followers to death by guillotine was announced on 20 November 1803. Because of the large crowd (about 30,000 onlookers) the guillotine was not constructed, as was usual, near the Gau Gate (Gautor), but outside the walls directly in front of the New Gate (Neutor). On 21 November 1803, the condemned were driven in five open wagons to the public place of execution. B√ºckler was the first to be led to the scaffold. Seconds later the execution was completed. 24 minutes after the first execution, it was all over. After the severed heads had fallen, by means of a device into the lower, covered part of the scaffold and first examinations had been made, their bodies were taken to a nearby barracks built especially for this purpose. Professors of the √âcole Sup√©rieure in Mainz (formerly the university) and scientists of the Mainz Private Medical Association (Medizinische Privatgesellschaft zu Mainz) carried out inter alia investigations with electricity in order to test whether decapitated persons still showed sensations. Based on these investigations, the true location of B√ºckler's body can no longer be determined. Although today in the anatomical collection of the University of Heidelberg there is a skeleton with the inscription Schinderhannes, this skeleton is missing B√ºckler's known arm and leg fracture, it also has a different body size and has had a different skull since 1945. According to an evaluation of the contemporary medical reports, B√ºckler also had the last stage of tuberculosis in his chest. Popular culture In 1832, Leitch Ritchie wrote the novel Schinderhannes: the Robber of the Rhine based on the life of the outlaw. Guillaume Apollinaire dedicated a poem to him in his collection Alcools (1913). He has been known as the German Robin Hood and his story romanticised by a Carl Zuckmayer play Schinderhannes and several films including The Prince of Rogues (1928) in which he is played by Hans St√ºwe.Who was 'Schinderhannes'?, p.93, Mayl 2011, BBC History Magazine, Nick Rennison In Czechoslovakian TV-Series Slavn√© history zbojnick√© (1985), Schinderhannes is played by Czech actor Miroslav Vladyka.'Schinderhannes'. ƒåesk√° televize.

The Committee‚Äôs leadership has testified to Congress about North Korean human rights and China‚Äôs forced repatriation of North Korean refugees. In April 2012, HRNK held its first major conference on North Korean human rights to launch its publication, The Hidden Gulag, Second Edition on North Korean political prison camps. History Commission of inquiry on human rights in the DPRK, receive the first Human Rights Award given by HRNK. The image shows commissioners Sonja Biserko, Marzuki Darusman, and Michael Kirby being presented the award by the organization's Co-Chair Roberta Cohen and Executive Director Greg Scarlatoiu. =Establishment= HRNK was founded in 2001 by a group of foreign policy and human rights specialists to fill a gap in non- governmental expertise on North Korea. Well-established organizations such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch initially found it difficult to incorporate North Korea, about which information is frequently difficult to obtain, into their models of research and advocacy. HRNK, in contrast, was an explicitly non-partisan research organization. In 2003 HRNK released the first edition of The Hidden Gulag by David Hawk. This was the first comprehensive study of North Korea‚Äôs prison camp system. =Past Involvement= From its inception, HRNK promoted itself as a non-partisan holder of expertise on North Korea in the United States. Early members of the Board of Directors included individuals with varying political affiliations and policy prescriptions‚Äîincluding Chuck Downs, Nicholas Eberstadt (of the American Enterprise Institute, conservative think-tank), Carl Gershman (president of National Endowment for Democracy), Morton I. Abramowitz (former president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace think-tank), and Samantha Power (one of the Obama administration's proponents of the 2011 military intervention in Libya.Samantha Power Brings Activist Role Inside to Help Persuade Obama on Libya bloomberg.com, Indira A.R. Lakshmanan and Hans Nichols - Mar 25, 2011Samantha Power: The voice behind Obama's Libya action Margaret Talev, McClatchy Newspapers, Miami Herald, Friday, 03.25.11). Co-chairs of the Board of Directors included US Representative Stephen J. Solarz (cosponsor of the 1991 Gulf WarSteve Solarz (1940‚Äì2010) and the Making of Senator Schumer , Capital New York (Nov. 30, 2010)) and Ambassador James R. Lilley (CIA agent during 30 years in Asia, worked in Laos to undermine communist insurgency and he helped to insert a number of CIA agents into China. He was also a member of Ronald Reagan administration), for whom the North Korean Human Rights Act of 2001 is named. Solarz, a former New York Democratic congressman, was known as the \\"Marco Polo of Congress\\" for his long record of international travel and involvement in foreign affairs. Most notably, he was the first American politician to visit Kim Il-sung. Lilley was personally close to former President George HW Bush and served as Ambassador to the Republic of Korea and the People‚Äôs Republic of China. Both Solarz and Lilley garnered respect from both sides of the aisle and emphasized a spirit of bipartisan comity. =Testimony in the U.S. Congress= Executive Director Greg Scarlatoiu, giving testimony in April 2015, at the U.S. Congress' Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission, on the topic \\"North Korea‚Äôs Forced Labor Enterprise: A State- Sponsored Marketplace in Human Trafficking\\". In September 2011, HRNK executive director Greg Scarlatoiu testified at a hearing of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, and Human Rights, entitled \\"Human Rights in North Korea: Challenges and Opportunities\\". Scarlatoiu emphasized the flow of information into North Korea, recommending on behalf of HRNK that \\"the United States should continue to expand radio broadcasting into North Korea and encourage other efforts that provide information directly to the North Korean people in accordance with the North Korean Human Rights Act.\\" The Congressional-Executive Commission on China received testimony from HRNK chair Roberta Cohen and Scarlatoiu on March 5, 2012 at a hearing on \\"China‚Äôs Repatriation of North Korean Refugees.\\" HRNK presented six recommendations to the commission and encouraged China to fulfill international obligations to protect North Korean refugees. In June 2014, HRNK co-chair Andrew Natsios testified before the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights and International Organizations, in what was entitled \\"Human Rights Abuses and Crimes Against Humanity in North Korea\\". In addition to outlining the ongoing crimes against humanity exposed by the COI, Natsios claimed, \\"While the US administration proposed and discussed imposing sanctions and other forms of pressure on the North Korean regime on the UN Security Council level, they were measures taken in response to North Korea‚Äôs aggressions and nuclear weapons program, unrelated to human rights issues.\\" =Governance= HRNK's Board of Directors includes prominent individuals from the North Korea and human rights policy communities. Research work on human rights issues =International Abductions= HRNK released its publication, Taken: North Korea's Criminal Abduction of Citizens of Other Countries, to a crowd of 150 people in Washington, D.C. on May 5, 2011. Taken is a study that documents North Korean abductions, which total over 180,000 abductees, and exposes the breadth and scope of North Korea's actions. This report informed the international and D.C. communities about these crimes and helped build evidence for North Korea to be held accountable for its actions. =Prisons= HRNK, The International Coalition to Stop Crimes Against Humanity in North Korea, and Maureen and Mike Mansfield Foundation hosted the presentation of \\"Trapped in North Korea‚Äôs Gulag:The Story of Oh Kil-nam and His Family\\" on November 6, 2011. The event featured Dr. Oh Kil-nam and was delivered at the Mike and Maureen Mansfield Foundation. HRNK executive director spoke at the panel presentation. HRNK released its publication, Hidden Gulag Second Edition: Political Prison Camps, and held a conference at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. The report calls for the dismantlement of the vast North Korean political prisoner camp system in which 150,000 to 200,000 are incarcerated. The April 10, 2012 conference on North Korea‚Äôs gulag brought together former North Korean prisoners, human rights experts, representatives of governments, UN agencies, Korea specialists, the private sector, and NGOs to inform, collaborate, discuss, and make recommendations on North Korean human rights issues. HRNK presented \\"Human Rights in North Korea: Prison Camps in 2012\\" at the U.S.-Korea Institute at SAIS on December 13, 2012. Gordon Flake, co-vice chair of the board of directors at HRNK and executive director of the Maureen and Mike Mansfield Foundation, and HRNK board member Carl Gershman and president of National Endowment for Democracy presented information on North Korea during the panel discussion. HRNK published Hidden Gulag IV: Gender Repression and Prisoner Disappearances by veteran human rights investigator David Hawk on September 18, 2015. The report uses satellite imagery and defector interviews to reveal the addition of a women's section to a prison camp facility known as Kyo-hwa-so No. 12 and describe the plight of North Korean women repatriated from China. The report also addresses \\"double disappearances,\\" or North Koreans who vanished first into political prisons and again as such detention facilities were dismantled or relocated.  Satellite Imagery  Published by HRNK in 2003, The Hidden Gulag, First Edition includes satellite imagery of political prison camps provided by DigitalGlobe with camp locations and facilities identified by North Korean defectors. In The Hidden Gulag Second Edition: Political Prison Camps, HRNK was able to publish 41 higher resolution camp images in which defectors marked structures as small as guard towers and homes with the advent of Google Earth technology. HRNK and AllSource Analysis, Inc. have worked together to conduct detailed satellite imagery analysis of specific camps over time, and some of this work contributed to the United Nations‚Äô Report of the commission of inquiry on human rights in the Democratic People‚Äôs Republic of Korea. Most recently, HRNK and AllSource Analysis discovered the closure of the Camp 15 ‚ÄúRevolutionizing Zone‚Äù and issued this report: Imagery Analysis of Camp 15 ‚ÄúYod≈èk‚Äù Closure of the ‚ÄúRevolutionizing Zone.‚Äù =Songbun= HRNK released the first comprehensive study of North Korea‚Äôs discriminatory social classification system, Marked for Life: Songbun, North Korea's Social Classification System, to a group of 200 people at the American Enterprise Institute on June 6, 2012. As a starting point, this report recommended that North Korea allow the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the United Nations Special Rapporteur in North Korea full, free, and unimpeded access, so that they can study the impact of the songbun system on the human rights of North Koreans. Governments, NGOs and international organizations are urged to call attention to this deliberate state policy of discrimination and work to eliminate this practice that so flagrantly violates basic principles of human rights. This report informed the international and DC communities about this political system and helped further understanding of and policy responses to the North Korean regime. =Mass Surveillance and Coercion= HRNK launched its report, Coercion, Control, Surveillance, and Punishment: An Examination of North Korea‚Äôs Police State, at the Korea Economic Institute (KEI) on July 19, 2012, to a group of 100 people. Authored by North Korean leadership specialist Ken E. Gause, the publication reveals the labyrinth of pervasive security agencies and informants that help the Kim regime maintain surveillance and control over its people. This report informed the international and DC communities about the North Korean state security system and helped further understanding of and policy responses to the North Korean regime. = Executions = HRNK‚Äôs 2012 report Coercion, Control, Surveillance, and Punishment: An Examination of the North Korean Police State reveals that public executions are not uncommon in North Korea, nor is the death penalty limited to the ‚Äúmost serious crimes,‚Äù constituting a violation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Used to instill fear in the North Korean people, these public executions are usually conducted by firing squad but hangings occur occasionally as well. Published by HRNK in 2012, The Hidden Gulag Second Edition: Political Prison Camps describes public and secret executions in the kwan-li-so and kyo-hwa-so prisons. Former prisoners report being forced to throw rocks at and hit corpses following executions. Most executions were punishments for attempted escape, but ‚Äúcrimes‚Äù such as eating chestnuts off the ground without permission were also punished by death. One prisoner witnessed an estimated 50-60 executions per year, including group executions of up to 20 people. In April 2015, HRNK and AllSource Analysis, Inc. discovered what appeared to be a satellite image of an execution by ZPU-4 anti-aircraft machine guns at the Kanggon Military Training Center outside of Pyongyang. The report on this frightening finding, ‚ÄúUnusual Activity at the Kanggon Military Training Area in North Korea: Evidence of Execution by Anti- aircraft Machine Guns?,‚Äù garnered significant media attention, including coverage by The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal. The authors also note reports of the executions of two generals and an unknown number of artists by anti-aircraft machine gun in 2013 as part of Kim Jong-un‚Äôs ‚Äúfearpolitik‚Äù and purge of disloyal officials. Major conferences = \\"Hidden Gulag\\" Conference (2012) = At the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington D.C., HRNK hosted its first major conference on the \\"Hidden Gulag,\\" addressing North Korea‚Äôs network of political prison camps, on April 10, 2012. HRNK launched its publication, the second edition of The Hidden Gulag by former Amnesty International Executive Director and human rights specialist David Hawk, at the conference The conference attracted significant media attention, including an editorial in The Washington Post that touted the conference as \\"unprecedented.\\" Robert King, the U.S. Special Envoy for North Korean Human Rights Issues, addressed the conference. Glyn Davies, the U.S. Special Representative for North Korean Policy, was also in attendance. =\\"A Call for Action\\" Conference (2012)= HRNK organized a conference at the Simon Wiesenthal Center at the Museum of Tolerance on October 12, 2012 on \\"North Korea‚Äôs Political Prisoner Camp System and the Plight of North Korean Refugees: A Call for Action.\\" HRNK's Executive Director and members of the Board of Directors spoke at the conference and provided education on North Korea.

HRNK provided the speakers, coordinated for the event, invited the Korean American community in the Chicago area, and presented talks on North Korea's political prison camps system. This conference was delivered to 300 people, including Korean Americans and Holocaust survivors. The event, which was translated simultaneously on-site in Korean and English, was led by and featured HRNK Executive Director Greg Scarlatoiu, Resident Fellow Professor Hyun In-ae, and Board Co-Chair Roberta Cohen. They discussed the promotion of effective action and ways the Chicago and greater Midwest community can become involved in the North Korea-related advocacy and awareness. =\\"Human Rights in North Korea: An Address by Michael Kirby\\" Conference (2014)= The Brookings Institution and HRNK hosted an event in which Michael Kirby, chair of the U.N. Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in North Korea (COI), addressed the report's findings and recommendations. The year-long investigation, which included hearings and interviews with North Korean defectors, found that \\"in many instances, the violations found entailed crimes against humanity based on state policies.\\" Following Justice Kirby's address, Marcus Noland of the Peterson Institute for International Economics and an HRNK board member commented on the report. And Roberta Cohen, Co-chair of HRNK and Non-resident Senior Fellow, Brookings, was on a panel discussing the implications of the COI. The conference drew significant media attention, and it was aired on C-SPAN. = Hidden Gulag IV and Camp 15 Imagery Update Release (2015) = On September 18, 2015, HRNK launched its publications The Hidden Gulag IV: Gender Repression and Prison Disappearances and North Korea: Imagery Analysis of Camp 15 \\"Yodok\\" - Closure of the \\"Revolutionizing Zone\\" at the Newseum in Washington D.C.

Neither the German leader Adolf Hitler nor his High Command of the Armed Forces (Oberkommando der Wehrmacht, or OKW) believed it was possible to carry out a successful amphibious assault on Britain until the RAF had been neutralised. Secondary objectives were to destroy aircraft production and ground infrastructure, to attack areas of political significance, and to terrorise the British people into seeking an armistice or surrender. The British date the battle from 10 July to 31 October 1940, which represented the most intense period of daylight bombing. German historians usually place the beginning of the battle in mid-August 1940 and end it in May 1941, on the withdrawal of the German bomber units in preparation for Operation Barbarossa, the campaign against the Soviet Union. The Battle of Britain was the first major campaign to be fought entirely by air forces; the British in the defensive were mainly using fighter aircraft, the Germans used a mixture of bombers with fighter protection. It was the largest and most sustained bombing campaign attempted up until that date. The failure of Nazi Germany to destroy Britain's air defence or to break British morale is considered its first major setback.Bungay 2000, p. 388. Fighter aircraft =Main types: Hurricane, Spitfire and Bf 109= The most famous fighter aircraft used in the Battle of Britain were the British Hawker Hurricane and Supermarine Spitfire Mk I and the German Messerschmitt Bf 109 E variant (Emil) single-engined fighters. Although the Spitfire has attracted more attention, the Hurricanes were more numerous and were responsible for most of the German losses, especially in the early part of the battle. The turn-around time (re- arm and refuel) for the Spitfire was 26 minutes, while the Hurricane's was 9 minutes, which increased its effectiveness. Many of the Spitfires used in the battle were purchased privately. Money raised by towns, companies, clubs or individuals was used to buy Spitfires for ¬£5,000 each with the purchaser having naming rights. Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands donated ¬£215,000 to purchase 43 Spitfires. X4474, a late production Mk I of 19 Squadron flown by Sergeant Jennings in September 1940. The Spitfire and Bf 109E were well- matched in speed and agility, and both were somewhat faster than the Hurricane.Price 2002, p. 78. The slightly larger Hurricane was regarded as an easier aircraft to fly and was effective against Luftwaffe bombers.Bungay 2000, p. 74. The Royal Air Force's preferred tactic was to deploy the Hurricanes against formations of bombers and to use the Spitfires against the fighter escorts. The view from the \\"blown\\" clear cockpit hood of the Spitfire was considered fair, while upwards good; view to the rear was considered fair for a covered cockpit. The curved plexiglass windscreen however was very bad optically and caused considerable distortion, which made long-distance visual scanning difficult. Spitfire pilot Jeffrey Quill made recommendations for the installation of \\"optically true\\" glass into the side panels to solve the problem.Delve 2007, p. 24. The Hurricane had a higher seating position, which gave the pilot a better view over the nose than the Spitfire. The upper canopy panels of the Bf 109 through its E-3 subtype were curved, while the E-4 and later Emil subtypes were modified for better visibility with flat panels and the new design was often retrofitted to earlier 109s. Handling and general overview Each of the three main fighters had advantages and disadvantages in their control characteristics; much of the air combat during the battle occurred at about 20,000 feet or lower. Due to its sensitive elevators, if the stick was pulled back too far on the Spitfire in a tight turn: During tight turns the \\"twist\\" or washout designed into the wing by Reginald Mitchell meant that the wing root would stall before the wingtips, creating the shuddering and clattering referred to. This noise was a form of stall warning, reminding the pilot to ease up on the turn.Bungay 2000, p. 78. British testing in September 1940 revealed that some Bf 109 pilots succeeded in keeping on the tail of the Spitfire, despite the latter aircraft's superior turning performance, because a number of the Spitfire pilots failed to tighten up the turn sufficiently. The gentle stall and good control under \\"g\\" of the Bf 109 were of some importance, as they enabled the Luftwaffe' pilot to get the most out of the aircraft in a circling dog-fight by flying very near the stall. The Bf 109 used leading edge slats which automatically deployed prior to stalling, but also made it much more difficult to continue chasing either a Hurricane or Spitfire with a tight turn in aerial combat manoeuvres, from the slats intermittently opening in tight turns (on the wing to the \\"inside\\" of a turn) during dogfights. The Rolls-Royce Merlin engine of the British fighters had the drawback of being equipped with a float-type carburettor which cut out under negative \\"g\\" forces. The fuel injected Daimler-Benz DB 601 engine gave the 109 an advantage over the carburettor-equipped engine; when RAF fighter attempted to \\"bunt\\" and dive away from an opponent as the 109 could, their engines would temporarily cut out for the duration of the negative-g forces. This ability to perform negative-g manoeuvres without the engine cutting out gave a 109 pilot better ability to disengage at will.McKinstry 2007, p. 205. On the question of comparative turning circles in combat, Spitfires and Hurricanes benefited from their lower wing loading compared with the Bf 109: the Royal Aircraft Establishment estimated the Spitfire's turning circle ‚Äì without height loss ‚Äì as 212 m (700 ft) in radius (the Hurricane's would be slightly tighter) while the 109E's was estimated as 270 m (890 ft) radius at 3,657 m (12,000 ft).Green 1980, p. 70. Other sources variously list a turn radius of between 125 m (410 ft) and 170 m (558 ft)at ground level and 230 m (754 ft) at 6,000 m (19,690 ft) for the 109E.Baubeschreibung f√ºr das Flugzeugmuster Messerschmitt Me 109 mit DB 601, 1939. Reprint: Luftfahrt- Archiv Hafner.Radinger and Schick 1999. The Emil was smaller than either RAF fighter, and it was more difficult to land and take off than the Spitfire and Hurricane.Bungay 2000, p. 199. At high speeds controls tightened considerably, and the Bf 109E needed more strength to manoeuvre than either of its main opponents. Of all three fighters, the Bf 109E would possess the highest roll rate, with the aileron controls being brisk and responsive; the Spitfire had the highest aileron forces, but both the Spitfire and the Messerschmitt's rate of roll suffered at high speed. Overall the differences in performance between the Bf 109 and Spitfire were marginal and in combat they were surmounted by tactical considerations such as which side had seen the other first, which side had the advantage of altitude, numbers, pilot ability etc. with the main difference between the two aircraft being the Spitfire's tighter turning ability and the Bf 109's faster climb rate.Price 2002, p. 78. Armament Both RAF fighters were armed with eight .303 Browning machine guns in the wings, harmonised by the squadrons to allow the bullets to converge at a distance. The Brownings had a high rate of fire and even a short burst from the eight machine guns sent out a large number of bullets. Although efficient against many aircraft, the small calibre bullets were often unable to penetrate the armour plating which was being increasingly used in Luftwaffe aircraft to protect crew and vital areas. An incendiary round, called the \\"De Wilde\\" was available, and this could do more damage than the standard \\"ball\\" rounds.Bungay 2000, p. 176. During the battle at least one Hurricane was experimentally armed with a single Hispano 20 mm cannon in a pod under each wing although it proved to be too slow and sluggish on the controls to be effective.Price 1980, pp. 22, 41, 156. Several Spitfires, designated Spitfire Mk. IBs, were also modified to carry a Hispano cannon in each wing panel. 19 Squadron was equipped with this version in June 1940. On entering combat in August this first cannon armed Spitfire failed to create an impact, with the guns often jamming and unable to fire. When it did work, however, the Hispano was an effective weapon, with its shells easily able to penetrate the armour plating and self-sealing fuel tanks of Luftwaffe aircraft.Price 1996, pp. 20‚Äì21, 53. The Emil's main armament depended on the subtype. The E-1 was armed with four MG 17 7.92mm machine guns; two cowl guns above the engine with 1,000 rounds per gun, and two in the wings with 500 rounds per gun. The E-3, E-4 and E-7s retained the fuselage armament of the E-1 but replaced the MG 17 wing guns with two 20 mm cannons, one in each wing with 60 rpg; either MG FFs (E-3) or the more advanced MG FF/M (E-4 and E-7) that could fire the new German Mine shell ammunition. Although the explosive shells had greater destructive power than the bullets of the Brownings, these cannon's low muzzle velocity and the limited ammunition capacity of their drum magazines meant that the armament was not markedly superior to the RAF fighter's eight machine guns. Three or four hits from the cannons were usually enough to bring down an enemy fighter and, even if the fighter was able to return to base, it would often be written off.Price 1982, p. 76. For example, on 18 August a brand new Spitfire of 602 Squadron was hit by 20 mm shells which exploded in the structure of the rear fuselage. Although the crippled aircraft was successfully landed back at its airfield it was subsequently deemed to be unrepairable.Price 1980, pp. 132‚Äì133, photo section between pp. 150‚Äì151. The MG FF/M, used in the Bf 109E-4, was modified to fire the more destructive, high-capacity mine-shells propelling the lighter shells at greater velocities than the MG FF.Williams and Gustin 2003, p. 23.Williams and Gustin 2003, p. 313. The early shells of this type had contact fusing, detonating on contact with the skin of the airframe rather than penetrating, then exploding.Bungay 2000, p. 197. The more streamlined Bf 109 F-1, issued in small numbers starting in October, carried two cowl MG-17s and a single 20mm MG FF/M in the fuselage as an engine-mounted Motorkanone, firing through the propeller hub. Fuel tanks A drawback of the Hurricane was the presence of a fuel tank just behind the engine firewall, which could catch fire and within a few seconds severely burn the pilot before he managed to bail out. This was later partly solved by fitting a layer of \\"Linatex\\" fire-resistant material to the tank, and an armoured panel forward of the instrument panel. Another hazard was presented by the main wing root mounted fuel tanks of the Hurricane, which were vulnerable to bullets fired from behind.Bungay 2000 The main fuel tanks of the Spitfire, which were mounted in the fuselage forward of the cockpit, were better protected than that of the Hurricane; the lower tank was self-sealing and a panel of 3 mm thick aluminium, sufficient to deflect small calibre bullets, was wrapped externally over the top tanks. Internally they were coated with layers of \\"Linatex\\" and the cockpit bulkhead was fireproofed with a thick panel of asbestos.Price 1996, pp. 18‚Äì21. On all the German fighters and bombers, the fuel tanks were self-sealing, and although capable of sealing leaks from enemy rounds, this could not prevent possibly fatal damage being inflicted by the \\"De Wilde\\" incendiary round which was being used by the RAF. German fighter fuel capacity A standard 300 litre capacity drop tank of the German WW II Luftwaffe, as the E-7 subtype was equipped to use A much more serious issue for the Luftwaffe's single-engined fighter force during the Battle was the Bf 109E's limited fuel capacity as originally designed. The Bf 109E escorts had a limited fuel capacity resulting in only a 660 km (410 mile) maximum range solely on internal fuel, and when they arrived over a British target, had only 10 minutes of flying time before turning for home, leaving the bombers undefended by fighter escorts. Its eventual stablemate, the Focke- Wulf Fw 190A, was only flying in prototype form in the summer of 1940; the first 28 Fw 190A-0 service test examples were not delivered until November 1940. The Fw 190A-1 had a maximum range of 940 km (584 miles) on internal fuel, 40% greater than the Bf 109E. The Messerschmitt Bf 109E-7 corrected this deficiency by adding a ventral center-line ordnance rack to take either an SC 250 bomb for Jabo duties, or a standard 300 litre (66 Imp. gal/80 US gallon) capacity Luftwaffe drop tank to double the range to 1,325 km (820 mi). The ordnance rack was not retrofitted to earlier Bf 109Es until October 1940. Durability and armour The Spitfire, from about mid-1940, had 73 pounds (33 kg) of armoured steel plating in the form of head (of 6.5 mm thickness) and back protection on the seat bulkhead (4.5 mm), and covering the forward face of the glycol header tank. The Hurricane had a similar armour layout to the Spitfire, and was the toughest and most durable of the three. Serviceability rates of Hawker's fighter were always higher than the complex and advanced Spitfire. The Messerschmitt Bf 109 E-3 received extra armour in late 1939, and this was supplemented with a 10 mm thick armoured plate behind the pilot's head during and after the Battle of France. Behind the fuel tank, an 8 mm armoured plate was placed in the fuselage protecting the tank and the pilot from attacks from behind. Three-view drawing of the Bf 109E-3 with the early B-series style curved-top canopy. Propeller types By July 1940, more efficient de Havilland and Rotol constant speed propellers had begun replacing two-pitch propellers on front line RAF fighters. The new units allowed the Merlin to perform more smoothly at all altitudes and reduced the takeoff and landing runs. The majority of the front line RAF fighters were equipped with these propellers by mid-August. The Bf 109E also used a constant speed Vereinigte Deutsche Metallwerke (VDM) three-blade unit with automatic pitch control. 100 octane aviation fuel As early as 1938 Roy Fedden, who designed most of the Bristol Engine Company's most successful aero engines, pressed for the introduction of 100 octane aviation fuel from the US, and later that year the British aero engine manufacturers Bristol and Rolls- Royce demonstrated variants of their 'Mercury' and 'Merlin' engines rated for 100 octane fuel.Warner 2005, pp. 99, 112.Flight 1938, p. 528. A memorandum by the \\"Department of Defence Co-Ordination\\", 'Proposals for securing adequate supplies of 100 octane fuel to meet war requirements', 23 December 1938, noted that there was a need to increase supplies of 100 octane fuel and discussed ways in which this could be achieved.\\"Proposals for securing adequate supplies of 100 octane fuel to meet war requirements.\\" naa12.naa.gov.au. Retrieved: 2 January 2010. A meeting was held on 16 March 1939 to consider the question of when the 100 octane fuel should be introduced to general use for all RAF aircraft, and what squadrons, number and type, were to be supplied. The decision taken was that there would be an initial delivery to 16 fighter and two twin-engined bomber squadrons by September 1940. However, this was based on a pre-war assumption that US supplies would be denied to Britain in wartime, which would limit the numbers of front-line units able to use the fuel.Peyton-Smith 1971, p. 259. On the outbreak of war this problem disappeared; production of the new fuel in the US, and in other parts of the world, increased more quickly than expected with the adoption of new refining techniques.Payton-Smith 1971, pp. 259‚Äì260. As a result, 100 octane fuel was able to be issued to all front-line Fighter Command aircraft starting in the spring of 1940.Price 1996, p. 19. Although U-boats and surface raiders had begun to take a heavy toll of tankers, in the summer of 1940 there was a surplus of these ships because of the incorporation into the British merchant marine of tanker fleets from countries overrun by Germany.Payton-Smith 1971, pp. 128‚Äì130. The combination of CS propellers and 100 octane fuel put the British fighters on par with the Luftwaffe.Morgan and Shacklady 2000, pp. 55‚Äì56.Society of Automotive Engineers 1997, p. 11.Wood and Dempster 1990, p. 87.

Retrieved: 15 June 2009. With 100 octane fuel the supercharger of the Merlin III engine could be \\"boosted\\" to +12 lbs/sq.in., producing 1,310 hp (977 kW) at 3,000 rpm at 9,000 feet (2,743 m) with a time limit of five minutes.Harvey-Bailey 1995, p. 155. This increased power substantially improved the rate of climb, especially at low to medium altitudes, and increased the top speed by 25‚Äì34 mph up to 10,000 feet. During the Battle of France and over Dunkirk RAF Hurricanes and Spitfires were able to use the emergency boost.Beamont 1989, p. 30.Gray 1990, p. 27. \\"In the first half of 1940 the RAF transferred all Hurricane and Spitfire squadrons to 100 octane fuel.\\"Lloyd, p.139 In the opinion of a pre-war paper by the British Air Ministry, Germany, as a large producer of synthetic fuel, was thought to be in a favourable position to produce 100 octane fuel in large quantities.\\"Proposals for securing adequate supplies of 100 octane fuel to meet war requirements.\\" Annex 1, p. 8. Retrieved: 7 April 2012 The German supply of aviation fuels was largely based on the hydrogenation of coal, due to their limited supplies of natural crude oil. At the outbreak of the war, Germany already had seven destructive hydrogenation plants in operation, with a total installed capacity of 1,400,000 t/year of oil.Report on the Petroleum and Synthetic Oil Industry of Germany. London: The Ministry of Fuel and Power, 1947. p. 47. At the start of the war the Luftwaffe standardized on 87 octane aviation gasoline, called \\"B4\\", made from leaded hydro-petrol extracted from brown coal. In 1940 an improved fuel, designated \\"C2\\" was introduced having a higher aromatic content of 35‚Äì38% and giving performance equivalent to Allied 100 octane grade of that time.Archived Fischer-Tropsch.org pdf file (extract) pp.119‚Äì120. Retrieved:27 March 2019. C2 was used in small quantities by aircraft such as the Messerschmitt Bf 109E-4/N and E-7/N and the Messerschmitt Bf 110C when equipped with the DB 601N engine, that entered series production in October 1939.Griehl 1999, p. 8. The power was increased by 20% over that of the DB 601A, to 1,260 hp at 6,900 feet (2,100 m) at 1.35 atm boost pressure and 2,400 rpm.Mankau and Petrick 2001, p. 24. By July, nine Bf 110 and three Bf 109 fighter Staffeln (squadrons) were equipped with the new engines, By the end of October around 1,200 DB 601N engines had been delivered.Mankau and Petrick 2001, p. 28. and the number of aircraft equipped with the improved engine gradually increased through the second half of the year.Mankau and Petrick 2001, pp. 24‚Äì29. However, due to leaking valves there was relatively high wear on the 601N-engines, which had a life of about 40 hours.Starr 2005, pp. 43‚Äì47.van Ishoven 1977, p. 107. =Other fighter aircraft= In addition to the Hurricane, Spitfire, and the Bf 109, several other fighter aircraft ‚Äî mostly twin-engined heavy fighters ‚Äî took part in the Battle of Britain. Messerschmitt Bf 110 At the start of the battle, the twin-engine Messerschmitt Bf 110 long range \\"destroyer\\" (German: Zerst√∂rer) was expected to engage in air-to-air combat while escorting the Luftwaffe bomber fleet. Although the aircraft was well designed and the best of its class, being reasonably fast (Bf 110C-3 about 340 mph [547 km/h]) and possessing a respectable combat radius, the concept that the Bf 110 could defend bombers against a concerted attack by a force of fast single-seat, single-engined fighters was flawed. When pitted against the Hurricane and Spitfire the Bf 110s began to experience heavy losses through being only slightly more manoeuvrable than the bombers they were meant to escort and suffering from poor acceleration.Bungay 2000, pp. 52‚Äì53. A Bf 110D-1 with the \\"dachshund's belly\\" integral fuel tank A variant of the 110 was the Bf 110D-1, nicknamed \\"Dachshund-belly\\" (Dackelbauch) because of the fixed, wooden, 1,050 litre (277 U.S. gal) fuel tank fitted under the fuselage. I./ZG 76, based in Norway, was equipped with this version in order to provide air cover for convoys sailing along the Norwegian coast. On 15 August, in the belief that all of the RAF fighter units were concentrated far to the south, Luftflotte 5 launched its first and only bomber attack against North Eastern England. Seven out of the 21 I.ZG 76 aircraft being used as bomber escorts were destroyed, including that of the Gruppenkommandeur (\\"Group Commander\\").Weal 1999, p. 48. The casualty rates for all of the Zerst√∂rergeschwader wings using the Bf 110Cs were extremely high throughout the battle, and they were unable to fulfill the high aspirations of Hermann G√∂ring, who had referred to them as his \\"Ironsides\\" (Eisenseiten).\\"Weal 1999, pp. 42‚Äì51. The most successful role of the Bf 110 during the Battle was as a \\"fast bomber\\" (Schnellbomber), the same role that the Junkers Ju 88A had been designed for in the mid-1930s. One unit, Test Group 210\\" (Erprobungsgruppe 210) ‚Äî originally meant to service test the Bf 110's intended (but ill-fated) replacement, the Messerschmitt Me 210 ‚Äî proved it could carry a greater bomb load over a greater range than a Ju 87 and deliver it with similar accuracy, while its much higher maximum speed, especially at lower altitudes, meant it was far more capable of evading RAF fighters.Bungay 2000, pp. 257‚Äì258. The Bf 110 possessed a heavy armament of two 20 mm MG FF/M cannon and four 7.92 mm MG 17s concentrated in the forward fuselage, along with a single 7.92 mm MG 15 for rear defence in the rear cockpit. Boulton Paul Defiant 264 Squadron Defiants. (PS-V was shot down on 28 August 1940 over Kent by Bf 109s.) For the British, the most disappointing fighter was the Boulton-Paul Defiant. This aircraft was intended to be used as a \\"bomber destroyer\\" because it was thought: However, between the medium bomber types used by the Luftwaffe ‚Äî the Do 17Z, the He 111P & H, and the Ju 88A, none of these had a manned tail-gunner's position in the rear fuselage as part of their designs, as used during the Battle. By 1940, it was clear to both the RAF and the Luftwaffe that the deadliest opponents of bombers were single-engine, single-seat fighters with fixed, forward firing armament. Apart from the extra weight and drag imposed by the four-gun turret and second crew member, the Defiant lacked any directly forward-firing armament. Should the gunner need to escape from the turret in an emergency, the only way he could do this was to traverse the turret to one side and bail out through the escape hatch ‚Äî but if the aircraft's electric system was disabled, immobilizing the all-electric turret due to its power source being knocked out, there was no escape. After the strong intervention of Dowding, who realised the Defiant was designed to an unworkable concept, there were only two units equipped with this aircraft, 141 and 264 squadrons. On 19 July, after encountering Bf 109s of III./JG 51, 141 Sqn had four Defiants shot down, one written off and one damaged, with 10 crew members killed or missing.Ramsay 1989, pp. 326‚Äì327. Just over a month later, on 24 August 264 Sqn suffered the loss of four Defiants shot down and three badly damaged with seven crew members killed.Ramsay 1989, pp. 376‚Äì377. Both units were withdrawn from 11 Group, reequipped, and took no further part in daytime operations.Bungay 2000, pp. 84, 178, 269‚Äì273.Ansell 2005, pp. 712‚Äì714. However, the Defiant was found to be more effective as a night fighter. It equipped four squadrons and during the winter Blitz on London of 1940‚Äì41, Defiants shot down more enemy aircraft than any other type.Taylor 1969, p. 326. Italian fighter aircraft The Fiat CR.42 was a biplane fighter used by the Italian Air Corps (Corpo Aereo Italiano). They only made one mission during the battle itself when on 29 October they provided a bomber escort on a raid on Ramsgate. Following the end of the battle, the Italian force continued to carry out limited raids on England, and on 11 November 1940, four CR.42s acting as escorts were destroyed by RAF Hurricanes with no loss to the RAF. German Luftwaffe aircraft had difficulty flying in formation with the biplanes, which also proved to be poor match for the more modern British fighters, and the CR.42s were transferred back to the Mediterranean theatre. The Italians also fielded a small number of Fiat G.50 monoplane fighters. Similar to the Luftwaffe's Bf 109E, this fighter was restricted by its short range of barely , likely due to limited internal fuel, but unlike the German mainstay fighter, the lack of a radio unit in most participating aircraft also challenged its usability. It is not known for certain if an additional number of Macchi C.200 Saetta monoplane fighters escorting formations of Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 Sparviero medium bombers ever participated in the Battle. Other British fighters A Bristol Blenheim Mk. IF of No. 25 Squadron at Martlesham Heath, July 1940 The Bristol Blenheim was used by both Bomber and Fighter Commands. Some 200 Mk. I bombers were modified into Mk. IF long-range fighters with 600 (Auxiliary Air Force) Squadron based at Hendon, the first squadron to take delivery of these variants in September 1938. By 1939, at least seven squadrons were operating these twin-engined fighters and within a few months some 60 squadrons had transitioned to the type. The Mk. IF proved to be slower and less nimble than expected and by June 1940, daylight Blenheim losses were to cause concern for Fighter Command. It was then decided that the IF would be relegated mainly to night fighter duties where No. 23 Squadron RAF who had already operated the type under night time conditions had better success. In the German night bombing raid on London, 18 June 1940, Blenheim night fighters accounted for five German bombers thus proving they were better suited in the nocturnal role. In July, No. 600 Squadron, by then based at RAF Manston, had some of its IFs equipped with Airborne Interception (AI) Mk. III radar. With this radar equipment, a Blenheim from the Fighter Interception Unit (FIU) at RAF Ford achieved the first success on the night of 2/3 July 1940, accounting for a Dornier Do 17 bomber. More successes came and, before long, the Blenheim was to prove invaluable in the night fighter role. Gradually, with the introduction of the Bristol Beaufighter in 1940‚Äì41, its role was supplanted by its faster, better armed progeny.Rimell 1990, p. 23. The first Beaufighters entered service in early September 1940, at first delivered in standard day fighter camouflage schemes although the type was intended for a night fighting role. The first night operations took place in September and October 1940 and on the night of 19/20 November 1940, a Beaufighter IF, equipped with AI radar downed a Ju 88. The aircraft from 604 Squadron was flown by Flt Lt. John Cunningham, scoring the first of his 20 victories.Rimell 1990, p. 17. The only British biplane fighter in operational service was the Gloster Gladiator which equipped No. 247 Squadron RAF, stationed in RAF Robourgh, Devon. Although no combat sorties took place at the height of the aerial battles, No. 247 Gladiators intercepted a He 111 in late October 1940, without result. No. 239 Squadron RAF using Gladiators in an army cooperation role and No. 804 Squadron, Fleet Air Arm outfitted with Sea Gladiators were also operational during the Battle of Britain.Rimell 1990, p. 27. The British had a cannon- armed fighter coming into service, the twin-engined Westland Whirlwind, but problems with its engines and slow production meant it did not enter service until December 1940. Bomber aircraft The majority of the bomber aircraft involved in the Battle of Britain were German although the Italians fielded a small number. =German bomber aircraft= The Luftwaffe in 1940 primarily relied on three twin-engined medium bombers: the Dornier Do 17, the Heinkel He 111 and the Junkers Ju 88. Despite the Luftwaffe being in the possession of advanced gyroscopic bomb sights, the Lotfernrohr 7 for daylight bombing and electronic navigational aids like the Knickebein, X-Ger√§t and Y-Ger√§t for nocturnal bombing, there were some very fundamental limitations to the accuracy of bombing from level flight, and there was no guarantee that such attacks could achieve success on small or difficult targets such as radar stations.Bungay 2000, pp. 251‚Äì257\\" For precision attack emphasis was placed on the development of aircraft which could utilise the technique of dive bombing for which the Junkers Ju 87 Stuka was specifically designed. The Junkers Ju 88 was fitted with external dive brakes and a control system, similar to those of the Ju 87 and could carry out a dive bombing role, although it was primarily used as a level bomber. The light bomb loads carried by the Ju 87 had been used to great effect during the Battle of France. However, the Ju 87 was slow and possessed an inadequate degree of defensive weaponry, with only a single, 7.92mm calibre MG 15 machine gun at the rear of the cockpit for rearward defense. Furthermore, it could not be effectively protected by fighters, because of its low speed and the very low altitudes at which it ended its dive bomb attacks. The Stuka depended on air superiority, the very thing being contested over Britain. It was therefore withdrawn from attacks on Britain in August after prohibitive losses, leaving the Luftwaffe short of precision ground-attack aircraft. Another constraint was imposed by the light armament carried by the Luftwaffe bombers. At the start of the battle they were still armed with an average of three hand held MG 15 light machine guns, which were supplied by 75 round \\"saddle drum\\" magazines. When faced with concentrated attacks by modern fighters such as the Hurricane and Spitfire this proved totally inadequate. Although many of the Luftwaffe gunners were well trained and capable of hitting a fast moving fighter the damage done was seldom enough to stop the attack in time to prevent heavy damage being done to the bomber. The high rate of fire of the MG 15 meant that the small magazines emptied quickly; the time taken to reload often gave a fighter the time it needed to make a successful attack. Efforts had been made to increase the number of defensive weapons, but this also meant that because the weapons were hand-held either more crew members were needed in each aircraft, or the existing crew members could be overworked. It was a problem which was never to be fully resolved and the Luftwaffe bombers had to rely on the ability of their fighters to protect their formations. The bombers did enjoy some advantages. As more armour plate was added in vital areas, crew members became less vulnerable. Their fuel tanks were also well protected by layers of self- sealing rubber, although the incendiary and tracer ammunition which was carried by RAF fighters could sometimes ignite fuel vapour in empty tanks. A Heinkel He 111 over Britain, 1940 The He 111 was nearly 100 mph slower than the Spitfire and didn't present much of a challenge to catch, although the heavy armour for the crew stations, self-sealing fuel tanks and progressively uprated defensive armament meant that it was still a challenge to shoot down. It was the most numerous German bomber type during the Battle, and was capable of delivering 2000 kg of bombs to the target, carried in an internal bomb bay ‚Äì usually eight 250 kg bombs, stored vertically. Subsequent variants allowed further increase in the bomb load and the maximum size of bombs carried, with external bomb racks. The state-of-the art Lotfernrohr 7 gyroscoping bomb sight fitted to the Heinkel allowed for reasonable accuracy, for a level bomber. The main versions of the He 111 in use were the Jumo engined H-1, H-2 and H-3 and the DB 601 powered P-2 and P-4. Small numbers of the aircraft, called H-1x and H-3x, were equipped with Knickebein and X-Ger√§t and were used by Kampfgruppe 100 (KGr. 100) at night during the closing stages of the battle. Y-Ger√§t equipped H-5y of III. Gruppe Kampfgeschwader 26 began to take part in the Blitz of the winter of 1940‚Äì1941.Ramsay 1988, pp. 25‚Äì27. A flight of Dornier Do 17 bombers The Do 17Z was an older type of German bomber that was no longer in production by the start of the Battle. Still, many Kampfgeschwadern still operated the Dornier, known as \\"the flying pencil\\" due to its sleek fuselage. Its air-cooled radial BMW engines meant that many of these aircraft were able to survive fighter attack because there was no vulnerable cooling system to disable.Price 1980, pp. 7‚Äì8. The Dornier was also manoeuvrable, and as a result was popular in the Luftwaffe. The main problem with the Dornier was its limited 200 mile combat range, when fully loaded with bombs. Its bomb carrying capacity was also limited to 2,205 lbs.Goss 2005, p. 12. Older versions of the Do 17, mainly the E-1, were still used for weather reconnaissance duties. Of the four types of bomber used by the Luftwaffe the Ju 88 (the original Schnellbomber) was considered to be the most difficult to shoot down. As a bomber it was relatively manoeuvrable and, especially at low altitudes with no bomb load, it was fast enough to ensure that a Spitfire engaged in a tail- chase would be hard pressed to catch up. It could carry up to 3,000 kg of bombs. However, only small sized 50 and 70 kg bombs, up to a total weight of 1,400 kg, could be carried internally, while larger bombs had to be carried on external racks, causing considerable drag. The Ju 88 was also extremely versatile, being fitted with both the Lotfernrohr 7 gyroscopic bomb sight and Stuvi dive sight as well as retractable dive brakes. The front MG 15 machine gun could be locked with an ingenious retracting clamp just forward of the windscreen to lock it for forwards firing, and could be used for strafing runs. Thus the Ju 88, dubbed as the \\"Big Stuka\\", was equally at home when it came to level or dive bombing or low-level attacks. The versions of the Ju 88 used during the battle were the small-wingtipped A-1 and the A-5; the latter incorporated several improvements, including the A-4's increased 20.08 meter wingspan and uprated armament.Filley 1988, pp. 10‚Äì19. The Ju 88 C-1 heavy fighter version, with a sheet metal nose replacing the bombers' \\"beetle's-eye\\" faceted glazing, was also used in small numbers. In reality, the Ju 88, although operating in smaller numbers than the Do 17 and He 111, suffered the highest losses of the three German bomber types. Losses of Do 17 and He 111s amounted to 132 and 252 machines destroyed respectively, while 313 Ju 88s were lost.\\"Aircraft Strength and Losses.\\" tripod.com.

I./KG 40 was equipped with a small number of the four-engined Focke-Wulf Fw 200 converted airliners, which were used to attack shipping and to provide long-range reconnaissance around the British Isles and out into the Atlantic Ocean.Ramsay 1989, pp. 605, 655, 680, 693. =Italian bomber aircraft= The Corpo Aereo Italiano (CAI) was an expeditionary force of the Regia Aeronautica that participated in the very late stages of the Battle of Britain. A BR.20 bomber of the Corpo Aereo Italiano The bomber element consisted of some 70 Fiat BR.20 twin engined bombers of 13¬∞ Stormo and 43¬∞ Stormo. based in Belgium. The Italian BR.20 was a bomber capable of carrying 1600 kg (3,528 lb) of bombs. Supporting aircraft included five CANT Z.1007 used for reconnaissance duties and several Caproni Ca.133 transports. The Italian bomber force flew limited operations, undertaken towards the end of the battle. The CAI's bombers flew about 102 sorties, only one of which attained any notable success‚Äî severe damage being caused to a canning factory in Lowestoft by a raid on 29 November 1940, which killed three people.Harvey 2003, p. 607. The first mission on 25 October,Wood and Dempster 1969, p. 299. a night attack of 16 aircraft on Harwich led to three bombers being lost, with one crashing on takeoff and two becoming lost on their return. On 11 November a formation of 10 BR.20s escorted by Fiat CR.42 biplane fighters on a daylight raid on Harwich, was intercepted by RAF Hurricanes. Three bombers were downed and three CR.42s destroyed with four damaged, with no loss to the Hurricanes.Green and Swanborough 1982, p. 308. In early January 1941 all of the bombers were redeployed.

The novel opens shortly after the action of The First Man in Rome. Gaius Marius and Lucius Cornelius Sulla eat dinner together with their wives, and discuss the threat presented by Mithridates VI of Pontus and Tigranes II of Armenia. Plot summary Although these two powerful Eastern rulers would eventually declare war on Rome and slaughter thousands of Roman citizens, the plot of the novel centres on the Social War of 91 to 88 BC, a civil war which Rome fought against its mutinous Italian Allies after they were refused full Roman citizenship. (The lengthy section dealing with Marcus Livius Drusus' attempt to secure them the citizenship, which ends in his tragic assassination, is one of the main turning points in the entire series.) Marius and Sulla, still friends and professional colleagues, face the Italian threat together, and succeed in putting down the rebellion of the Italians. However, Marius suffers a serious stroke (his second), and is forced to withdraw from the war. During this struggle, Sulla, rallying his troops against certain destruction near Nola, is hailed as 'imperator' on the field of battle and presented with the highest honour a Roman general can receive: the corona graminea, the eponymous 'Grass Crown'. This was only awarded a very few times during the Republic, and only ever to a general or commander who broke the blockade around a beleaguered Roman army or otherwise saved an entire legion or army from annihilation. However, once Rome has settled this pressing domestic matter, and can begin to plot revenge against Mithridates and Tigranes, Marius and Sulla have their first serious falling out over the question of who should lead the legions East. Marius, now an aged and discredited statesman previously dubbed the 'Third Founder of Rome', is pining for further glory and believes only he has the talent necessary to defeat the allied Kings. Sulla feels as though his old mentor is unwilling to step aside and wants to destroy Sulla's chance of outshining him. The Senate cites Marius's age and poor health as a reason to back Sulla, who moreover is the sitting consul and therefore has the side of right. The seeds of serious discord are planted. The Roman comitia quickly becomes a source of political conflict between the two men, and leads to Sulla's first shocking march on Rome. It also leads Gaius Marius to pursue an unprecedented seventh consulship, which he wins and undertakes after suffering a series of strokes, and is depicted in this novel as going mad. Other narrative threads of note: the childhood of Julius Caesar and Cato the Younger, as well as the early military careers of Pompey and Cicero (who was appointed to Pompeius Strabo as a cadet) in the Social War: and the unjust trial and exile of Publius Rutilius Rufus, falsely accused of extortion, driven out of Rome, and welcomed by a street festival in his honour in the city he was accused of looting.

It is overseen by the elders of the Forest Hill Church of Christ in Germantown, a suburb of Memphis, in the U.S. state of Tennessee. The MSOP's Logo Forest Hill Church of Christ - home of the Memphis School of Preaching Keith McAlister, Harold Mangrum, Tony Callahan, and Greg Mangrum - the elders of the Forest Hill Church of Christ which oversee MSOP  Faculty  Since January 2013, MSOP has been under the direction of B.J. Clarke, who replaced Administrative Dean Bobby Liddell. Currently there are ten instructors, each having spent over a decade preaching for congregations and performing the work of a preacher, some even continuing in that work. The current instructors include B.J. Clarke, Billy Bland, Bobby Liddell, Daniel F. Cates, Gary Colley, Keith A. Mosher, Sr., Michael McDaniel, and T.J. Clarke.  History  The Memphis School of Preaching had its beginning in 1966 at the Getwell church in Memphis, Tennessee, being first known as \\"Getwell School of Preaching.\\" Roy J. Hearn, an experienced educator and Bible teacher at two Christian colleges, saw the need for such a school to train preachers for the churches of Christ. It was felt that a two-year, intensive program of study would be the most effective way to equip a man to become a Christian preacher. He was encouraged in this endeavor by others such as N.B. Hardeman. There have been over 1,000 men who have graduated in the annual graduation exercises. On the last Sunday in March, 1967, the first Memphis School of Preaching Lectureship took place and continued through Thursday of that week. This lectureship now continues to take place annually during that same week in March. In March, 1969, it was decided that the school move from Getwell to the Knight Arnold Church of Christ. Classes were held in the various classrooms of the church building, and the auditorium was used for a chapel. Makeshift offices were set up in other rooms for Hearn and other instructors. In 1972, a two-story building to the rear of the church auditorium was erected, which included classrooms, equipment, offices, and a library. In 1978, the church auditorium was \\"stretched\\" to seat twice as many, or 724 people. With the annual lectureships growing, as well as the Knight Arnold congregation, additional space was necessary to accommodate everyone. The auditorium was redecorated, with new carpets and pews installed. In 1982, Curtis A. Cates joined the school as a faculty member and eventual successor to Hearn as school director. Hearn had expressed a wish to the elders of Knight Arnold that he would just like to study, teach, and write, so he was relieved of his administrative duties while he continued to teach for a time. Curtis A. Cates had academic training and administrative experience in teaching in Christian colleges, as well as having a teaching doctorate. He was known to many of the early graduates who took extension courses under him while he was with Alabama Christian School of Religion (formerly Southern Christian University, now Amridge University). Through these contacts with Amridge and other Christian colleges and universities, many of the brethren within the church of Christ had developed a high regard for the caliber of the instruction MSOP had given them. As the new millennium approached, so too did the need to move the school to its present location. The school moved to the city of Germantown. This provided the school a backdrop that was more rural and less laden with crime, and which had plenty of room for growth. So the Knight Arnold Congregation decided to move its ministry and the MSOP to its present location in Germantown, changing the congregation's name to Forest Hill. At the beginning of 2007, the eldership at Forest Hill announced that Cates would be stepping down from the position of Director to become the Director Emeritus. As of March 27, 2007, Bobby Liddell, who graduated from MSOP in 1979, would become the third Director. It was also announced that Cates would continue to teach at the school but would, in passing on his position, have more time to travel and write. During 2012, Bobby Liddell expressed his desire to take up a more active role in teaching and in local preaching. Effective January 1, 2013, B.J. Clarke became the fourth and current Director of the school. He arrived in 2006 as an instructor and also served as Dean of Admissions during that time. Bobby Liddell remains as a faculty member teaching classes and serving as Administrative Dean.  Lectureship  One of the highlights of the year for the Forest Hill Church of Christ and the preaching school is the Memphis School of Preaching Lectureship. During a typical worship service, the Forest Hill auditorium is only filled on the lower section. During the lectureship week, however, both decks of the auditorium are filled to capacity (holding over 1,100 people). In the past, topical studies have been considered, such as \\"Sin and Salvation,\\" \\"The Apostle Paul,\\" \\"Lessons in Lyrics,\\" and \\"What is Man?\\" Bible books, for example, \\"Ecclesiastes and Song of Solomon,\\" \\"Genesis,\\" and \\"1 and 2 Timothy and Titus,\\" have also been examined. MSOP Lectureship book, and Monday night singing. Guy N. Woods, Wendell Winkler, Alan Highers, Franklin Camp, Rex A. Turner, Sr., Thomas B. Warren, Garland Elkins, and Robert R. Taylor, Jr., among others known throughout the churches of Christ, have preached at the MSOP Lectureship. Each lecture remains available in various forms of media, including tapes, CD's, books, and the internet. An open forum, in which the moderator, Garland Elkins, gave biblical answers to biblical questions, was also held each day of the lectureship until being replaced by another lecture in 2009.  Campus  The MSOP school building itself is connected to the Forest Hill Church of Christ building. It serves as the primary classrooms for the school. = N.B. Hardeman Library = Soon the need for a separate library was seen due to the numerous volumes and other materials and memorabilia accumulated for use by the school and its students. A financial contribution by Joanne Bradshaw, granddaughter of N.B. Hardeman, helped the school to build the N.B. Hardeman Library. The N.B. Hardeman Library The central area of the first floor features a glass display case, featuring priceless memorabilia and pictures of brother Hardeman and his family, as well as paintings of his grandchildren. The case also displays hand written sermon outlines by Hardeman, and pictures of his Tabernacle Sermons in Nashville. Also on the first floor are reference books, various Bible translations, audio and video tapes, and back issues of church periodicals, including some publications dating back to the 1800s, such as the Gospel Advocate. The second floor of the library houses a variety of books, including text books on Christian Evidences and Bible Geography, lectureship books on various Biblical subjects dating back 50+ years. Also on the second floor are work stations and computers that can be used as an electronic card catalog, or for the students to conduct research for papers and assignments. The library also contains numerous videos of lectureships and debates from around the nation. = Student Housing = The desire to build Student Housing on the MSOP campus began when the school moved to its current location on Forest Hill-Irene Road. The original plans for the current location actually included the Student Housing within them, but it took several years in order for the school to secure the land that was needed, to finalize those plans, and to receive approval for construction from the City of Germantown. In 2006, construction began on the four apartment buildings known as the Student Housing; the total cost of which would be $3,500,000. By 2009, the debt had been paid in full by various donations. Student Housing was opened to students of MSOP in July 2007. The Housing consists of four apartment buildings, each with eight apartments, standing on the campus of the Forest Hill Church of Christ. Each of the thirty-two apartments has three bedrooms, two bathrooms, a living room, a kitchen, a dining room, a laundry room, a storage room, and either a balcony or a patio. A playground was installed behind the Housing in 2009 for the children to enjoy. The playground was built with donations made to the school in memory of Liddell's sister who had died not long before.

Early life Greenwell was born in Windsor and was educated at Newington College (1897‚Äì1901).Newington College Register of Past Students 1863-1998 (Syd, 1999) pp78 Architectural career Greenwell studied architecture at Sydney Technical College because there was no university architecture course available in Sydney, but also attended architecture lectures in the Engineering Faculty at University of Sydney.

Before studying abroad, Greenwell had been articled to the firm of Kent & Budden, and in 1912 he joined them in partnership as Kent Budden & Greenwell. During this time, Greenwell designed a number of now heritage-listed houses for family and friends in Strathfield, New South Wales and Killara, New South Wales. His design for a substantial domestic dwelling in Woodside Avenue, Strathfield, is characteristic of his houses of this period. Another notable design showing his distinctive rough-cast stucco columns is 'Terhyn Worthle' which was featured in \\"Domestic architecture in Australia\\" edited by William Hardy Wilson (Sydney : Angus and Robertson, 1919). These homes had elements of the Federation Arts and Crafts and Federation Bungalow styles. After the departure of Harry Kent, the firm became known as Budden & Greenwell.

It is used to develop phones that use the OS, as well as applications that run on those phones. It is based on the Eclipse IDE platform enhanced with extra plug-ins to support Symbian OS development. The product is provided by the Symbian Foundation under an open source model. In April 2009, Nokia transferred Carbide.c++ and many other software developer tools to the Symbian Foundation. Members of the Symbian community now manage and contribute code to the Carbide.c++ product. Tool packages Carbide.c++ is provided by the Symbian Foundation in two different tool packages. * Application Development Toolkit (ADT) contains tools for application development, including the IDE, debugger, and analysis tools. * Product Development Toolkit (PDT) contains tools for contribution and product creation. Both the ADT and PDT are basic installers that include Carbide.c++, several Eclipse-based plug-ins and several stand-alone tools. ADT/PDT v1 contains Carbide.c++ v2.0.4 ADT/PDT v2 (Q4 2009) is targeted to contain Carbide.c++ v2.2 Technology Carbide.c++ is based on the latest versions of Eclipse IDE and Eclipse CDT extended with Symbian OS -specific features. Currently it supports the WINSCW x86 C++ compiler found in CodeWarrior for production of emulator binaries. For target binaries it supports GCC, and ARM RVCT compilers (sold separately). The WINSCW and GCC compilers are actually provided in the SDK and not explicitly included in the Carbide IDE. Carbide.c++ has branched very few parts of CDT - nearly all of it is contained within added plug-ins added on top of Eclipse. The few branches mostly relate to the different semantics of the CodeWarrior debugger engine, compared to GDB which is what Eclipse previously supported. Because Carbide.c++ is very similar to a standard Eclipse installation, it can still be used for other types of development such as Java or Perl (provided the correct plug-ins are installed using Eclipse's self-update mechanism). Similarly, it ought to be possible to produce a product with similar functionality to Carbide.c++ by moving the Carbide.c++ plug-ins into a standard Eclipse installation; this is not currently a facility offered by Nokia. Carbide.c++ supports the Symbian Build System v1 and v2 (aka Raptor). The former is a perl-based build system and the latter is built using Python and supports the next generation Symbian OS operating systems. The main advantage of supporting SBSv1 and v2 in Carbide is users can create command- line builds in parallel with IDE builds and not have to manage two different workspaces. The disadvantage of SBSv1 is dependency checking is automatic on every build and re-building large projects to take a while. Carbide.c++ built in some short cuts (starting with v1.3) to speed up rebuilds. Early versions of Carbide (v1.0, 1.1) supported a different build method which had many problems. History Carbide.c++ development tools family was created to replace CodeWarrior for Symbian OS as the primary development environment for Symbian OS. Adoption of the tool has been slow but CodeWarrior usage is diminishing since the older tool no longer supports the latest changes to Symbian OS and S60 platforms. Carbide was provided as three commercial products and one free product. Today the product is part of the Symbian Foundation offering and is completely free. * Express‚ÄîBasic tools for application development. Contains project management, code authoring, emulator & GCC-E builds, and emulator debugging. The Express edition was provided for free and did not support development directly on production phones. * Developer Edition‚ÄîTargeted at aftermarket software development. Contained Express features, a UI Designer (for rapid UI creation), and application-level on-device debugging for S60 and UIQ phones. * Professional‚ÄîTargeted at Symbian OS phone manufacturers, their partners, and application/middleware vendors working on demanding projects. Contained Developer features, system-level on- device debugging, and performance profiling tools. * OEM‚ÄîTargeted at early- access embedded development such as driver-development, base porting, and hardware-dependent application and middleware development. Contained Professional features, and stop-mode debugging using Lauterbach and Sophia in- circuit emulators. The products ranged in price from 300 to 8000 Euros depending on features set and licensing model. Carbide had a slow reception to the Symbian community. Developers are generally not fond of moving to new tools and early versions of Carbide had problems. There were several frequently cited complaints - for example, lack of Symbian-OS-style code indenting, lack of an easy \\"find in files\\" facility, speed of import of Symbian OS build files (MMPs), and difficulties using on-device debugging. In addition, the much-anticipated Managed Build System did not work properly - rather than offering a true incremental build, it frequently deleted everything and started again. Otherwise the reception was warm - the development environment is preferred to CodeWarrior, the IDE is based on Java so there are some speed and memory concerns, the IDE is often slow and has a pretty big memory foot print, all trademarks of the Java environment. Carbide.c++ has made steady progress in addressing issues brought up by the developer community. CodeWarrior usage has dropped off significantly due to improvements in Carbide and CodeWarrior's lack of support for the newer versions of Symbian OS. Using Carbide.c++ To do Symbian OS C++ development you need the Carbide.c++ IDE and a Symbian OS-based SDK. This SDK contains the emulator and also the libraries and header files required for Symbian OS development. Development kits are available at Forum Nokia and the Symbian Foundation web sites. Please note that these kits may have different names reflecting additional capabilities (Cust kits, Developer Kits, PDK, iSSK).

Pedersen is a right-handed batsman who bowls right-arm off break. He was born at Herning. His brother, Michael, has also played for and captained Denmark. Early career Pedersen played three matches for Denmark Under-19s, against Bangladesh Under-19s in 1994, while the following year he played against Ireland Under-19s and Scotland Under-19s. He made his debut for Denmark in the 1996 European Cricket Championship against Italy, in what was his only appearance of the tournament. He made his ICC Trophy debut for Denmark in the 1997 ICC Trophy in Malaysia against the United Arab Emirates, with him making a further four appearances during the tournament, scoring 40 runs in his five matches. He toured the British Isles with Denmark later in 1997, playing two matches against the Somerset Second XI and Scotland, while the following year he toured Namibia with the team, making five appearances. In 1998, Pedersen also played in the European Cricket Championship, making five appearances in the tournament. In March 1999, he toured Zimbabwe with Denmark, making appearances against provincial teams such as Mashonaland, Mashonaland Country Districts and Manicaland. He made his List A debut for Denmark later in 1999 against the Kent Cricket Board in English domestic crickets NatWest Trophy. In 2000, he appeared in the ICC Emerging Nations Tournament in Zimbabwe, where he made a further five List A appearances against Zimbabwe A, the Netherlands, Scotland, Ireland and Kenya. Pedersen scored 145 runs at an average of 29.00, with two half centuries and a high score of 57, He featured in the 2001 ICC Trophy in Canada, making eight appearances. Pedersen generally struggled with the bat during the tournament, scoring 129 runs at an average of 16.12, though he did record a century in his second match against Hong Kong, with a score of 103. In August of that year, he made a further List A appearance in the first round of 2002 Cheltenham & Gloucester Trophy (previously the NatWest Trophy) against Suffolk. The match was played in 2001 to avoid fixture congestion in the following season. The following season, he featured in the 2002 European Championship in Northern Ireland, making five appearances. He made a further List A appearance in the 1st round of the 2004 Cheltenham & Gloucester Trophy against Wales Minor Counties, played late in the 2003 season. He captained Denmark for the first time in the 2004 European Championship in the Netherlands, succeeding the previous captain Soren Vestergaard. The following season, he made a further List A appearance in the 2005 Cheltenham & Gloucester Trophy against Northamptonshire at Svanholm Park, Br√∏ndby. Pedersen again captained the team, with the Danes being dismissed for just 56 in what was a heavy defeat to their first-class opponents. Later in 2005, Pedersen played in his third and final ICC Trophy during the 2005 ICC Trophy in Ireland. In a change from previous tournaments, this ICC Trophy held List A status. He captained Denmark during the tournament, making seven appearances, with him scoring 139 runs in the tournament, including a high score of 68 against the United States. In total, he represented Denmark in twenty ICC Trophy matches, scoring 308 runs at an average of 17.11. Later career Pedersen was selected to captain Denmark in the 2006 European Championship Division One in Scotland, making four appearances. This was his last engagement as captain, with Frederik Klokker succeeding him in that role. In November 2007, he was selected in Denmark's squad for the World Cricket League Division Two in Namibia, where he made six List A appearances, helping them secure fourth place and with a place in the 2009 World Cup Qualifier. Pedersen scored 168 runs at an average of 28.00 in the tournament, with a high score of 63 against Uganda. He played for Denmark in the 2008 European Championship Division One, before being selected for Denmark's squad for the World Cup Qualifier in South Africa in 2009. Pedersen made seven List A appearances during the tournament, the last of which came against Oman. He scored 234 runs at an average of 33.42 during the tournament, with a single half century score of 58 coming against the United Arab Emirates. Denmark finished the tournament in twelfth and last place, therefore failing to qualify for the 2011 World Cup. This tournament also marked what are to date his final List A appearances for Denmark. Having played a total of 29 matches in that format for his country, Pedersen has, in the process, scored 720 runs at an average of 26.66, while also making five half centuries. He was later selected as part of Denmark's squad for the 2010 European Cricket Championship Division One in Jersey, making five appearances. Pedersen was selected as part of Denmark's squad for the 2011 ICC World Cricket League Division Three tournament in Hong Kong. He scored 150 runs in the tournament, at an average of 25.00 and with a high score of 59. Despite being Denmark's third highest run getter, they were relegated to 2012 World Cricket League Division Four. Pedersen wasn't selected in Denmark's squad for the 2012 World Twenty20 Qualifier, however, in August 2012, he was selected in Denmark's fourteen man squad for World Cricket League Division Four in Malaysia.

Hinduism generally fit between the earlier Vajrayana Buddhism and the subsequent transition to Islam. Archaeological remains survive from the 8th or 9th century CE portraying Hindu deities such as Shiva, Lakshmi and the sage Agastya.Xavier Romero-Frias, The Maldive Islanders, A Study of the Popular Culture of an Ancient Ocean Kingdom. Barcelona 1999, Maldivian folklore contains legends about the sage Vashishta, known locally as Oditan Kalƒìge, a mighty sorcerer. Oditan Kalƒìge's wife is the beautiful D≈çgi AihƒÅ who possesses a fiery temperament and is as powerful a sorceress as her husband. Her name is derived from the Sanskrit word Yogini. It is not known why the last Buddhist king embraced Islam. The importance of the Arabs as traders in the Indian Ocean by the 12th century may partly explain why this king acted. He adopted the Muslim title and name (in Arabic) of Sultan (discarding the old Divehi title of Maha radun or Ras Kilege) Muhammad al Adil, initiating a series of six Islamic dynasties consisting of 84 sultans and sultanas that lasted until 1932, when the sultanate became elective. According to Merinid traveller Ibn Batuta, the person responsible for this conversion was Muslim visitor Abu al Barakat from Morocco. However, a more reliable Maldivian tradition says that he was a Persian saint from Tabriz called Yusuf Shamsuddin. He is also referred to as Tabrizugefaanu. His venerated tomb stands on the grounds of the Friday Mosque, or Hukuru miski, in Mal√©. Built in 1656, this is the oldest mosque in the Maldives.History of the Maldives Don Hiyala and Alifulhu Among Maldivian folklore in which the spirit and sorcery theme are not essential, the most significant is perhaps \\"Don HiyalƒÅ and Alifulhu\\". This story about two good-looking lovers is a much changed, Maldivian version of the RƒÅmƒÅyana. Despite the apparent dissimilarities, the common sequential structureVladimir Propp, Morphology of the Folktale, Austin, Texas, 1984, linking the elements of the Maldivian story with the Indian epic (the heroic married couple, the wicked and powerful king, the kidnapping of the beautiful heroine, etc.) is evident. This is hardly unexpected, for all South and Southeast Asian countries have local RƒÅmayƒÅna variations and the Maldives is part of South Asian culture. Indians in Maldives and their status An estimated 9,000 Indian citizens reside in the Maldives, according to 2000 census figures. The Indian Diaspora is mainly composed of doctors, teachers, engineers, accountants, managers and other professionals. They have helped the country to develop its human resources. The group also includes skilled and unskilled personnel such as technicians, masons, tailors, plumbers and laborers. One Maldivian citizen is of Indian origin. Both historically and commercially, south coast Indians, particularly from Kerala, were in close and regular contact with the Maldives. These contacts did not metamorphose into a composite socio-cultural group, perhaps owing to the exclusive Islamic identity of the Maldives and its people. Officially no Maldivians are Hindus. The state religion is Sunni Islam and conversion is not allowed. Maldivian customs laws prohibit import of any idol for the purpose of worship. Hindus in the Maldives are predominantly of Tamil or Malayali origin. See also * History of the Maldives * Maldivian folklore * Music of the Maldives References *Asian Variations in Ramayana.

The song was published in 1913, with music by Maurice Abrahams and lyrics by Grant Clarke and Edgar Leslie. It was introduced in vaudeville by Adele Ritchie, was a hit for recording artists such as Al Jolson in 1913, Billy Murray in 1914, duo Debbie Reynolds and Carleton Carpenter in 1951 and was revived by Bobby Horton in the Ken Burns documentary film Horatio's Drive (2003). The title was essentially self- defining. The song poked fun at the trials and tribulations of the average young car owner of the 1910s, especially when he wanted to get down to some serious \\"sparking\\" with his female passenger. Lyrics =Verse 1= :Johnny O'Connor bought an automobile, :He took his sweetheart for a ride one Sunday. :Johnny was togged up in his best Sunday clothes, :She nestled close to his side. :Things were just dandy till he got down the road, :Then something happened to the old machin'ry. :That engine got his goat, :Off went his hat and coat, :Ev'rything needed repairs. =Chorus= :He'd have to get under, :Get out and get under :To fix up his little machine. :He was just dying to cuddle his queen, :But ev'ry minute :When he'd begin it, :He'd have to get under, :Get out and get under, :Then he'd get back at the wheel. :A dozen times they'd start to hug and kiss :And then the darned old engine it would miss, :And then he'd have to get under, :Get out and get under, :And fix up his automobile. =Verse 2= :Millionaire Wilson said to Johnny one day, :\\"Your little sweetheart don't appreciate you, :I have a daughter who is hungry for love, :She likes to ride, by the way\\". :Johnny had visions of a million in gold, :He took her riding in his little auto, :But ev'ry time that he went to say \\"Marry me\\", :'Twas the old story again. =Chorus= :He'd have to get under, :Get out and get under :To fix up his little machine. :He was just dying to cuddle his queen, :But ev'ry minute :When he'd begin it, :He'd have to get under, :Get out and get under, :Then he'd get back at the wheel. :A dozen times they'd start to hug and kiss :And then the darned old engine it would miss, :And then he'd have to get under, :Get out and get under, :And fix up his automobile. : :ALTERNATIVE CHORUS VERSES : :A dozen times of love he'd try to speak, :And then the radiator it would leak, :And then he'd have to get under, :Get out and get under, :And fix up his automobile. : :To kiss and squeeze he'd boldly get to work, :And then the brakes would slip there'd be a jerk, :And then he'd have to get under, :Get out and get under, :And fix up his automobile. : :He'd start to tell the tale with lots of swank, :And then he'd find no petrol in the tank :And then he'd have to get under, :Get out and get under, :And fix up his automobile. :And then he'd have to get under‚Äîget out and get under‚Äîand fix up his automobile.

For the Small Stone effect pedal, see Electro-Harmonix. Small Stone Records is an American record label based in Detroit, MI. It was founded in 1995 by Scott Hamilton and is a self-dubbed \\"heavy rock\\" label. The label has released a number of stoner rock compilation albums, as well as releases by Dozer, Five Horse Johnson, Los Natas, Halfway To Gone, Solace, and many others in the stoner rock, indie, blues-rock, and psychedelic genres. History Small Stone Records was founded in Detroit, Michigan by Scott Hamilton in 1995, who remains owner and operator. Hamilton claims he mostly started the label to put out records by friends and his favorite bands such as Big Chief, The Laughing Hyenas, Mule, and Slot. Hamilton started the label with a $5000 loan and named it after the Small Stone effects pedal made by Electro-Harmonix. The label's first release was a single by 36-D, which had members of Big Chief, Born Without a Face, and Slot. The label's first album release was a 1995 compilation titled Detroit Rust City, which sold 1,000 copies the first week, and featured Kid Rock and Big Chief. Shortly afterward the label released Morsel's sophomore EP. In 1997 the label released an album by Perplexa, a band which included a member from WIG, who later went on to become West Indian Girl. Five Horse Johnson also signed to the label that year. The label initially featured a number of different rock genres but soon began focusing on the blues rock, psychedelic rock and stoner rock genres, and what Hamilton dubs \\"heavy rock.\\" Besides albums by groups such as Acid King, Dozer, Greenleaf, and Los Natas, the label has released a number of stoner rock compilations. The first, Right in the Nuts: A Tribute to Aerosmith, featured covers of Aerosmith, and was released in 2000. In January 2002, the label released Sucking the 70s, a two disc collection of 1970s songs covered by stoner rock bands. In 2006, the label released the compilation Sucking the 70's - Back in the Saddle Again, which featured covers of various 1970s songs. According to Hamilton, early on the Small Stone bands relied on networking with other bands on the label to organize tours and musical projects. In 2006, Small Stone began issuing the lost recordings of the band Slot, whose founder and guitarist had recently died. Remaining members of the band Sue Lott (bass) and Eddie Alterman (drums) were then joined by Phil Durr of Five Horse Johnson and Scott Hamilton on guitar to play at SXSW in the spring of 2007. The new reformation soon garnered Five Horse Johnson drummer Eric Miller, and formed the band Luder. Their first album, Sonoluminescence, was released on Small Stone in November 2009. Reviews dubbed the style \\"grunge-gaze.\\" The label continues to put out approximately 10 to 12 new releases a year. Small Stone's newer bands, such as Lo-Pan, Backwoods Payback, and Freedom Hawk continue to maintain busy touring schedules. Small Stone records is sometimes referred to as the \\"new home\\" for Man's Ruin bands. Acts like Acid King, Los Natas, Dozer, Sons Of Otis, Tummler, and Men Of Porn were picked up by Small Stone after the demise of the Man's Ruin record label (Some of those earlier Man's Ruin records have since been reissued by Small Stone, most notably the albums by Dozer, Acid King, and Sons Of Otis). Beginning in February 2014, Small Stone Records entered into a distribution agreement with Alternative Distribution Alliance.

The bread used for pambazos is white and lacks a crispy crust. This particular bread is made of flour, and is softer than the similar bolillo (also used for sandwiches), which allows it to retain its shape while being soaked in sauce. Teleras are usually found in Mexican bakeries where they are sold just as any other white bread. It is unclear since when or why the pambazo is prepared and filled in a very specific way. While other similar dishes changed the fillings or toppings, the pambazo recipe remains almost the same. The bread is first filled with the potato and chorizo, then dipped in warm red guajillo pepper sauce, which gives the bread its famous orange-red sprinkled coloration. Once the bread has been soaked, it is passed on to fry in a bit of oil. The pambazo is to fry on the top and bottom of the bread. The pambazo is ready whenever the bread being fried becomes crispy on both sides. It is then garnished with shredded lettuce, salsa (sauce), crema (cream), and queso fresco (fresh cheese). In the Mexican State of Veracruz, the pambazo, the bread, after some proofing the buns are punched in a bed of wheat flour and then back to proofing and baked. Once the bread is ready the top remain dusted and is sliced to the filling of layered grided refried black beans with chorizo , shreaded lettuce, sliced chipotle peppers in adobo, ground or squared queso blanco or queso fresco and spread mayonaisse. From food stands to backpacks or school lunch boxes the sandwich is wrapped in napkins to gently avoid dusted fingers, nose and lips. In other regions is filled with ham or polish meat. At birthday parties, parties or social events, small sized pambazos are served instead of canap√©s. These are known as pambacitos, which literally means \\"little pambazo\\". History The pambazo bread got its name from the Ladino word pan basso (Spanish pan bajo) or low-class bread from Mexico's viceregal period. During that period, there were bakeries in Mexico dedicated solely to this type of bread named 'panbasserias' (pambacer√≠as). :\\"On this type of bread, inferior quality flour or flour from deteriorated wheat were mixed to produce the pan basso. Bakeries produced minimal quantities of pan basso, a maximum of 4% of all flour in Mexico City\\" :Virginia Garc√≠a Acosta, Las panader√≠as, sus due√±os y trabajadores. Ciudad de M√©xico. Siglo XVII. Varieties =State of Mexico= Pambazos of Tequixquiac In some villages from State of Mexico, the pambazos are made with Semitic Mediterranean cuisine influence by the use the acemite or bran for bread made in artisan bakeries about horns of Spanish colonial period, as the case of Malinalco, Tequixquiac and Amecameca. In Malinalco, state of Mexico makes other pambazos, a Spanish colonial meal are made flour more small to Mexico City pambazos, filled with sausage and potatoes, chicken meat with epazote, shredded lettuce, white cheese, cream and spicy salsa. In Tequixquiac, state of Mexico makes pambazos very different to Mexico City, are made flour with dark wheat rind or bran named acemite, filled with sausage and potatoes, turkey meat or lamb meat (barbacoa), shredded lettuce, white cheese, cream and spicy chili chipotle sauce, fried with butter. The name is registered in this place as pan bazo, an archaic Spanish word. =State of Puebla= Pambazos of Puebla City In Puebla City, pambazos are made with flour in the bread named cemita or acemite, filled with sausage and potatoes, avocado, papalo, white cheese, cream and with red spicy salsa on the pambazo. =State of Veracruz= Pambazo with \\"Polish meat\\" In Orizaba, Veracruz, an important place with Sephardic roots, is made a pambazo with Carne Polaca \\"Polish meat\\", is mixture with traditional pambazo or acemite, meat and lettuce, with spicy sauce.

Gays and lesbians are generally tolerated (if not accepted) in Filipino society. Despite recent events that have promoted the rights, general acceptance, and empowerment of the Filipino LGBT community, discrimination remains. Homosexuals in the Philippines are known as \\"bakla\\", though there exist other terms to describe them. Similarly, Filipino lesbians are generally known as Alfa. According to the 2002 Young Adult Fertility and Sexuality Survey, 11 percent of sexually active Filipinos between the ages of 15 and 24 have had sex with someone of the same sex. According to Filipino poet and critic Lilia Quindoza Santiago, Filipino culture may have a more flexible concept of gender; kasarian (Tagalog for \\"gender\\") is defined in less binary terms than the English word; kasarian means \\"kind, species, or genus\\".\\"Kasarian.\\" Tagalog-English Dictionary. 2nd. ed. 1986. History Gender crossing practices go back to the history of pre-colonial communities in the Philippines. The babaylans are typically female spiritual leaders, akin to priests or shamans, in native communities, whose position can also be taken by males who crossed genders, and were called asog, among many names. Effeminate people, together with the weak, were handled gently during raids. According to J. Neil C. Garcia, the feminized men were similar to women in almost all aspects, except for childbearing. Movements to promote the acceptance of the gays in Philippine society include, but are not limited to the establishment of the Home of the Golden Gays by Justo Justo, the 1980 Women‚Äôs Movement which focused on the lesbian struggle of Filipinas, the formation of The Lesbian Collective which was the first formal lesbian organization in the country, the organization of the first LGBT Pride March in Asia and the Pacific on 26 June 1994 by Pro-Gay Philippines and Metropolitan Community Church Manila. The 1994 Pride March was organized in connection to the 25th commemoration of Stonewall Uprising in New York in 1969. Notable organizers were Murphy Red and Rev. Fr. Richard Mickley, then an MCC clergy and now retired. There are however, other individuals and groups who believes that the first pride march in the Philippines was in 1996. Beyond this, there have been numerous efforts to spread awareness of the LGBT. The community has become generally accepted in society, and have continued to initiate efforts that move for the greater acceptance, protection, and empowerment of its members.

The deity's prowess on fertility covers not only human and divine fertility, but also the fertility of all other things such as wildlife, crops, trees, and plants. A prayer dedicated to Lakapati was recited by children when sowing seeds: \\"Lakapati, pakanin mo yaring alipin mo; huwag mong gutumin (Lakapati, feed this thy slave; let him not hunger)\\". Lakapati is also known as the protector of sown fields, sufficient field waters, and abundant fish catch;San Buenaventura, P. (1613).

According to the scholar and linguist Jean-Paul Potet (2017), nothing is said about Bathala's gender, but the Sanskrit-derived masculine term may suggest a god, but was used as an epicene one by the Tagalog people. Similarly, the Tagalog word hari (meaning \\"sovereign) is also mentioned as an epicene or genderless term by Potet, since the term is not exclusive to male-gendered sovereigns, but also to those who are of the female gender. In Suludnon mythology, there are accounts of female binukots (well- kept maidens) who had powers to transition into male warriors. The most famous of which are Nagmalitong Yawa and Matan-ayon. In one epic, after Buyong Humadapnon was captured by the magical binukot Sinangkating Bulawan, the also powerful female binukot, Nagmalitong Yawa, casted her magic and transitioned into a male warrior named Buyong Sumasakay. He afterwards successfully rescued the warrior Buyong Humadapnon. In a similar epic, the female binukot Matan- ayon, in search of her husband Labaw Donggon, sailed the stormy seas using the golden ship Hulinday together with her less powerful brother-in-law Paubari. Once when she was bathing after sailing far, Buyong Pahagunong spotted her and tried to make her his bride. The event was followed by a series of combat, where in one instance, Matan-ayon transitioned into the male warrior Buyong Makalimpong. After a series of battles, Labaw Donggon arrives and attacks Buyong Pahagunong, while Buyong Makalimpong once again transitioned into Matan-ayon. Matan-ayon then has a conversation with the supreme goddess Laonsina about why the men are fighting and agree to sit back and watch them if they truly are seeking death.Change Me into A Chieftain: Resistance and Persistence in Upland Panay Island, Philippines, D.

Nomenclature Itneg potters, the person on the right is wearing women's clothes. Bakla and bading are Tagalog words for a man who has feminine mannerisms, or dresses or identifies as a woman. Although the terms are not the equivalent of the English \\"gay\\", the bakla are the most culturally visible subset of gay men in the Philippines. They are often considered a third gender, embodying femininity (pagkababae) in a male body. Although bakla is sometimes used in a derogatory sense, bakla people have largely embraced it. In addition to this, lesbians in the Filipino community are called tibo or tibs, which are likewise often used as derogatory terms. However, lesbians too have recently embraced this terms, and have used these terms jokingly to refer to each other. But despite being used to refer to lesbians, the word tibo or tibs often refer to the more masculine lesbian, otherwise known as the 'Butch'. In the Philippines, the word \\"gay\\" is used to refer to any LGBT person. For Filipino gays the Tagalog phrase paglaladlad ng kapa (\\"unfurling the cape\\") or, more commonly, paglaladlad (\\"unfurling\\" or \\"unveiling\\") refers to the coming-out process. Some lesbians (butch and femme) use the words magic or shunggril to refer to themselves; paminta describes masculine gay men. Neutral slang terms for gay men include \\"billy boy\\", badette , \\"badaf\\" and bading. Although many of these terms are considered derogatory, they are sometimes used casually or jokingly by the Filipino gay and lesbian community. Rights Although legislation supporting same-sex marriage in the Philippines has been proposed several times in the Philippine legislature, none has been passed. The Philippine Commission on Elections (COMELEC) disqualified the Filipino LGBT political party Ladlad from fronting a candidate in the 2007 general election, concluding that the party did not have a nationwide membership. COMELEC again refused Ladlad's petition to contest the 2010 elections on the grounds of \\"immorality\\". However, on 8 April 2010, the Supreme Court of the Philippines overturned COMELEC's decision and allowed Ladlad to participate in the May 2010 elections. The Philippines has been ranked one of the most gay-friendly nations in the world and is the most gay-friendly in Asia. In a survey of 39 countries (only 17 of which had a majority accepting homosexuality), the Philippines were the 10th most gay- friendly. The survey, \\"The Global Divide on Homosexuality\\" conducted by the US-based Pew Research Center, showed that 73 percent of adult Filipinos agreed that \\"homosexuality should be accepted by society\\" (up from 64 percent in 2002). =LGBT Rights Bill (SOGIE Bill)= The House of Representatives approved on the LGBT Rights on 20 September 2017. The lawmakers had voted 198-0 in the approval of House Bill 4982, otherwise known as the Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression Equality (SOGIE) Bill. Those who violate this bill are required to pay a penalty of ‚Ç±100,000 to ‚Ç±500,000 and imprisonment for one to six years. This bill prohibits and penalizes any discriminatory acts against Lesbians, Gays, Bisexuals, and Transgender people. The SOGIE Bill penalizes the following acts: * Gender Profiling * Denying or revoking a professional or other similar kind of license, clearance, except marriage license, issued by the government * Denying access to public service, including military service including SOGIE as criteria for human resource action * Refusing admission or expelling a person from any educational or training institution * Denying a person access to public or private medical and other health services open to general public Language Swardspeak, or \\"gay lingo\\", is cant or argot derived from Taglish (Tagalog-English pidgin) and is used by the Filipino LGBT community. It uses elements of Tagalog, English, Spanish and Japanese, celebrities' names and trademarked brands, giving them new meanings in different contexts. Words derived from indigenous languages, including Cebuano, Hiligaynon, Waray, Bicolano and others, are also used by LGBT communities. A Swardspeak speaker could be identified as homosexual, making it easier for people in the LGBT community to recognize each other. This created a group of speakers, helping the community resist cultural assimilation and marginalization. Straight people have begun to use Swardspeak, however, particularly in gay-dominated industries such as fashion and film. Politics March 2018 rally at the People Power Monument by supporters of the SOGIE Equality Bill, a proposed legislation tackling LGBT rights in the country. While there are no laws pertaining to same-sex marriage or unions, Open Table MCC Church, a local church (Mandaluyong City, Philippines) of the Universal Fellowship of Metropolitan Community Churches (UFMCC), cites freedom of religion in sanctioning what it calls holy unions. These ceremonies are conducted solely for the purpose of celebrating love and are not legally recognized. The Filipino Ang Ladlad party, whose founders, leaders, and core constituency belong to the LGBT community, was recognized by the government and participated in party elections in 2013. Transnational networks such as LGBT non-government organizations allow connected brokers in the Philippines to widely adopt goals and strategies that are cross-culturally recognizable. Efforts to pass an anti-discrimination bill that prohibits using sexual orientation and gender identity as a basis for discrimination is an example. Goals and tactics used in the Philippines such as emphasis on \\"sexual orientation\\" and \\"gender identity\\" as a distinct part of the self, the idea of being \\"out\\", and pursuit of rights-based remedies are hallmarks of transnational LGBT politics. The diffusion of LGBT subjectivities affected by the shifts in the global system allow studies exploring links between LGBT advocacy and hegemonic geopolitics to increase. An example is through the non- relational diffusion though media, technology, and shifts in democracy and neoliberalism. According to Oscar Atadero, one of the organizers of the 1994 Pride in Manila, the decline of interest in a style of mobilization that is public and militant and the failure of mass movement in the Philippines can be attributed to \\"the sudden appearance of the Internet at the same time gays and lesbians were forming political movements\\". There are, however, notable movements as well. One mobilization was Ladlad‚Äôs \\"immoRALLY\\" in front of the COMELEC office in Manila, two weeks after the rejection of their petition for party-list accreditation in the 2010 elections. The protest rally was held after COMELEC rejected the petition based on moral grounds, claiming that the LGBT people are not immoral. The event brought together national organizations such as Babaylan, Task Force Pride, and the Akbayan party-list to protest the charge against the LGBTs. Geraldine Roman is the first transgender person to be elected to the Philippine congress. She has been a staunch advocate of an anti-discrimination bill. Entertainers Aiza Seguerra and Arnell Ignacio are the first LGBT-community members appointed as government officials; they were appointed by President Rodrigo Duterte chair of the National Youth Commission and vice-chair of the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation, respectively. In December 2019, Duterte appointed trans activist Dindi Tan as director of the Department of Agrarian Reform. The Communist Party of the Philippines, a Maxist-Leninist-Maoist political organization, states that it has recognized same-sex relationships within its membership since 1998.  Media  The Philippine media and show business scene‚Äîencompassing film, radio, and television‚Äîcomprises a vital part of LGBT culture in terms of representation. Prominent celebrities including Vice Ganda and Boy Abunda are all featured in major programs and are often tapped to endorse major products and services. In 2004, the Republic of the Philippines Movie and Television Review and Classification Board (MTRCB) had disseminated a memorandum calling homosexual relationships‚Äîparticularly lesbian relationships‚Äîan \\"abnormality of human nature\\", discouraging producers from broadcast any sort of portrayals that promoted these relationships. While there are still several LGBT personalities in show business as well as LGBT characters in films and television programs in the Philippines, notices such as this have limited particular LGBT portrayals in media. For the gay Filipino man, two main stereotypes have been revealed in studies to be dominantly presented in media. There is the feminine gay who often cross-dresses, demonstrates stereotypically feminine actions and speech and is attracted to stereotypically masculine men. The following films have portrayals of the feminine gay: * Markova: Comfort Gay * Aishite Imasu: 1941: Mahal Kita * Ang Pagdadalaga ni Maximo Oliveros * Petrang Kabayo In contrast to this is the masculine gay portrayal, where the men still appear stereotypically masculine but are attracted to the same sex. A cited example of this is the film In My Life. Lesbianism in Philippine media has also been studied with two common stereotypes emerging: the butch and the femme. The two are often seen in a butch-femme dichotomy, where in a lesbian couple one assumes the traditional roles of the masculine-male and the feminine-female, respectively. Femme-to- femme relationships, when depicted, have been shown more often as abused or ridiculed couples in a more heteronormative society. The following teleseries are recent portrayals of femme-to-femme lesbian relationships in the Philippines: * The Rich Man's Daughter (2015) * Baka Bukas (2016) Die Beautiful, a 2016 comedy-drama narrating the life (and death) of a transgender beauty queen, was entered into the 2016 Metro Manila Film Festival and won two awards at the Tokyo International Film Festival in 2016. LGBT representation outside of television and films have been made through existence of gay beauty pageants such as Miss Gay Philippines. It is in this competition that all manner of gays, men or women, as well as transgender and bisexuals are eligible to enter, granted that they first meet the qualifications/requirements of the pageant. However, the organization of these events have been met with controversy in certain cases. For example, in 2013, at the 9th Cinemalaya Philippine Independent Film Festival awarding, transgender woman Mimi Juareza was still considered under the \\"male\\" category as Best Actor and referred to with the pronoun \\"he\\". Events 2019 Metro Manila Pride. 2019 Metro Manila Pride. With the general tolerance of the country towards the LGBT community, its members have organized a number of events in the past years to empower the Filipino community in creating a safe space for the LGBT. Since the First Pride March in 1994, the LGBT community has continued to celebrate this event on the month of June. The more recent Pride Marches have become more visible to the public with its organizers' use of social media to promote the advocacy, and the event. More Recent Metro Manila Pride Marches 2015 - Fight For Love The 21st Metro Manila Pride March in 2015, entitled Fight For Love, was held on 25 July. The turnout of the event was an estimated number of 2,000 participants. 2016 - Let Love In The following Metro Manila Pride March was themed Let Love In. There was an uncertainty whether or not the event would take place due to the Orlando Nightclub Shooting, but the event still pushed through. The march began at Luneta Park on 25 June 2016. 2017 - #HereTogether Pride March in 2017 was entitled #HereTogether. On 24 June that year, members and supporters of the LGBT Community gathered at Plaza de los Alcaldes, Marikina to begin the 2017 Metro Manila Pride March. 2018 - #RiseUpTogether The 2018 Metro Manila Pride March, which took place on 30 June 2018 and began at Marikina Sports Center, was themed #RiseUpTogether. Compared to the previous year with about 7,700 participants, this year‚Äôs Pride March round up to 20,000 attendees. 2019 - #ResistTogether Held at the Marikina Sports Complex, the 2019 Pride was themed #ResistTogether, which fashioned the march as a celebration of the country's diversity and a protest against homophobia, biphobia, and transphobia. The pride also focused on the passage and support for the SOGIE Equality Bill in Congress. Attendance in the 2019 march peaked at 70,000 people, almost thrice the number from the 2018 march.https://www.rappler.com/move-ph/234256-in- photos-resist-together-metro-manila-pride-march-2019 Advocacy *Alpha Nu: Begun in 2014 and considered the Philippines' first openly gay fraternity, Alpha Nu is recognized by the University of the Philippines-Diliman and advocates non-violent initiations, gender sensitivity and psychological support.

He lived and worked in D√ºsseldorf, Germany; Cambridge, Massachusetts; and Groton, Massachusetts. Biography Otto Piene by Lothar Wolleh (c. 1960s) Otto Piene was born in 1928 in Bad Laasphe and was raised in L√ºbbecke. At the age of 16, he was drafted into World War II as an anti-aircraft gunner. As a German soldier, he became fascinated by the glowing lines of searchlights and artillery fire in the night. Post-war from 1949 to 1953, he studied painting and art education at the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich, and at the Kunstakademie D√ºsseldorf. He was a lecturer at the Fashion Institute in D√ºsseldorf. From 1952 to 1957, he studied philosophy at the University of Cologne. He was a Visiting Professor at the University of Pennsylvania beginning in 1964. From 1968 to 1971, he was the first Fellow appointed to the Center for Advanced Visual Studies (CAVS), founded by Gy√∂rgy Kepes at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The CAVS allowed artists to work using sophisticated techniques and scientific partnership, promoting a highly-collaborative environment. In 1972, Piene was appointed a Professor of Environmental Art at MIT. In 1974 he succeeded Kepes as director of the CAVS, a position he served until September 1, 1993. Piene remained closely associated with CAVS and MIT for the rest of his life, and maintained longtime homes in both Groton, Massachusetts and D√ºsseldorf, Germany. Piene collaborated with many artists, scientists, and engineers, including \\"Doc\\" Edgerton (pioneer of stroboscopy) and astrophysicist Walter Lewin at MIT. Many of his public installations required multiple collaborations because of their large physical scale and ambitious program. For example, his 1977 Centerbeam installation involved 22 artists and a group of scientists and engineers, some of whom were based internationally. On July 17, 2014, Piene died of a heart attack in a taxi on the way to ready for the opening of his Sky Art event at Neue Nationalgalerie in Berlin, Germany.German artist Otto Piene dies aged 86 BBC News, 18 July 2014. His survivors included his wife Elizabeth Goldring (a poet and artist who collaborated with him), as well as four children, a stepdaughter, and five grandchildren. Group Zero In 1957, Piene and Heinz Mack founded the group ZERO, consisting of artists who wanted to redefine art after World War II.Kristine Stiles & Peter Selz, Theories and Documents of Contemporary Art: A Sourcebook of Artists' Writings (Second Edition, Revised and Expanded by Kristine Stiles) University of California Press 2012, pp. 476-478 In 1961, G√ºnther Uecker joined the group. By the 1960s they were internationally known, especially in Japan, Americas, and throughout Europe. Members of the group included Piero Manzoni, Yves Klein, Jean Tinguely, and Lucio Fontana. Piene and Mack also published ZERO Magazine from 1957 to 1967. In 2008, Piene, Mack, Uecker, and Mattijs Visser created the international ZERO foundation. The foundation maintains the ZERO archives from the three D√ºsseldorfer-based artists, as well as documents and photos from other related artists. Works Otto Piene, foyer glass ceiling, 1970, University of Konstanz acrylic and scorch marks on linen, 1973, Honolulu Museum of Art In 1957, Piene developed the Grid Picture, a type of stencilled painting made from half-tone screens with regularly arranged points in single colors (yellow, silver, white, or gold), for example Pure Energy (1958, New York, MOMA). Piene's work then developed in a variety of forms. The Lichtballette (\\"light ballet\\", 1959) was a development of the Grid Pictures; light from moving lamps was projected through grids, thus extending and stimulating the viewer's perception of space. This series of works was inspired by L√°szl√≥ Moholy-Nagy's Light Space Modulator (1930, located at Harvard since 1956) and Fernand L√©ger's Ballet M√©canique (1924).Jonathan T.D. Neil, Otto Piene: Light Ballet and Fire Paintings, 1957-1967 Art Review, May 4, 2010. Accessed 31 January 2011. Also in 1959, the combination of these grids with sources of fire (candles, gas-burners) produced smoke-traces and fire paintings, in which the paint was scorched. Piene created these Rauchbilder (\\"smoke pictures\\") as a reference to elemental natural energies. In his \\"fire paintings\\", he lightly burned a layer of solvent on pigmented paper, developing organic forms from the remnants of the resulting soot deposits. Throughout the remainder of his career, he continued his practice of making \\"smoke pictures\\". Fire and smoke (their traces) are important elements in these pictures. Silver Fire (1973, Honolulu Museum of Art) is an example of a smoke picture. Piene also experimented with multimedia combinations. In 1963, together with G√ºnther Uecker and Heinz Mack, he became a spokesman of Neuen Idealismus (\\"the new idealism\\"). In 1967 Otto Piene premiered Proliferation of the Sun at Aldo Tambellini's Black Gate Theater, and in 1968 he collaborated with Aldo Tambellini on the Black Air at the Black Gate Theater. Piene is also noted for having explored new uses for broadcast television. In 1968, Aldo Tambellini and Otto Piene reformatted Black Air as Black Gate Cologne, which is cited as one of the first television programs to have been produced by experimental visual artists. 1967 marked the beginning of Piene's involvement with \\"Sky Art\\", a term he coined in 1969 for his use of landscape and cities themselves as the focal point of his work. For the closing of the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, Piene created the sky work Olympic Rainbow, made up of five different- colored floating helium-filled polyethylene tubes, each long. Between 1981 and 1986, Piene organized four Sky Art conferences in the US and Europe.Stephan von Wiese, Otto Piene MoMA - The Collection. Source: Oxford University Press. Accessed 31 January 2011. He experimented in industrial design in the 1970s with a 500-piece run of the upscale Suomi tableware by Timo Sarpaneva that Piene decorated for the German Rosenthal porcelain maker's Studio Linie. Working as the director of the CAVS at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Piene collaborated in the design of the kinetic sculpture performance Centerbeam first exhibited in Kassel, Germany in 1977. Later mounted on the National Mall in Washington DC, it featured laser-projected images on moving screens of steam, solar-tracked 3-D holograms, a water prism, and helium-buoyed sky sculptures. Otto Piene, Das Geleucht (Mining Lamp), steel, glass, LEDs, 30 m high, 1998-2007 (Halde Rheinpreu√üen, Moers, Germany) In 1978, Piene was commissioned by the Smithsonian Art Collectors Program to create a print to benefit the educational and cultural programs of the Smithsonian Associates. The print was to commemorate a Washington DC festival much like the 1977 exhibition in Kassel. Three lithographs resulted, all titled, Centerbeam, one of which hung in the exhibition, Graphic Eloquence, in the S. Dillon Ripley Center on the National Mall. In 1999 in the Ludwig Galerie Schloss Oberhausen, Piene debuted his proposal for a statue called Das Geleucht. This monument in the form of a mining lamp was to be built on the spoil tip Halde Rheinpreu√üen in Moers, lighting up at night. In 2007 after delays securing funding, the high monument illuminated the spoil tip nightly. In 2011 Piene exhibited new public artworks as part of the Festival of Art, Science, and Technology (FAST) which concluded a year of MIT150 celebrations of MIT's founding in 1861. Exhibitions Piene had his first solo exhibition at Galerie Schmela, D√ºsseldorf, in 1959. With Light Ballet, he debuted at Howard Wise Gallery, New York, in 1966. He represented Germany at the Venice Biennale in 1967 and 1971, and exhibited at documenta in Kassel, Germany, in 1959, 1964 and 1977.Otto Piene - Biography Axel Vervoordt Gallery. Accessed 31 January 2011. In 1985, he exhibited at the S√£o Paulo Biennial. Piene's solo exhibitions include retrospectives at the Kunstmuseum im Ehrenhof, D√ºsseldorf, in 1996 and at the Prague City Gallery Prague, in 2002, and a show at the Museum am Ostwall, Dortmund in 2008-2009.Otto Piene: Light Ballet and Fire Paintings, 1960-1967 Sperone Westwater Gallery, 19 March 2010.

In 2014, the Guggenheim Museum in New York held an exhibition featuring a survey of the work of the Zero Group, that included many works by Piene. In 2019 the largest solo show to date, Fire and Light: Otto Piene in Groton, 1983‚Äì2014, debuted at the Fitchburg Art Museum near the artist's former home in Groton, Massachusetts. Collections Licht und Bewegung, Cologne, Germany Piene's works are in more than 200 museum and public collections around the world, among them the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, the National Museum of Modern Art in Tokyo, the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam, the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris, the Harvard Art Museums, and the List Visual Arts Center at MIT. Recognition The University of Maryland, Baltimore County awarded Piene an honorary Doctor of Fine Arts in 1994. In 1996, he received the Sculpture Prize of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, New York. In 2003, he became the recipient of the Leonardo da Vinci World Award of Arts in recognition of his artistic and innovative accomplishments. After his death, he was praised by Germany‚Äôs minister of culture, Monika Gr√ºtters, who said that \\"many of his highly aesthetic works in public space were also a signal against the inhospitality of our cities\\".

He is best known for his research in Egypt including excavations in the Valley of the Kings where he investigated the long-neglected undecorated tombs in the royal cemetery. His work there resulted in the rediscovery of the lost and controversial tomb KV60, the re-opening of the long-buried KV21 with its two female and likely royal occupants, and tombs KV27, KV28, KV44, KV45 and KV48.

He is best known for having been one of poker's most prolific tournament reporters. Early life Andy Glazer grew up in Massapequa, New York. He graduated from Plainedge High School in 1973, and went on to attend the University of Michigan. His interest in sportswriting manifested itself early. At high school Glazer was the sports editor of the school newspaper; in college, he served as the Managing Sports Editor for the University of Michigan school newspaper, Michigan Daily, and as a sports commentator for the school radio station. After graduating from the University of Michigan in 1977, he was accepted at the Emory University School of Law. There he served as the editor in chief of the school newspaper until his graduation in 1980. Glazer practiced law for only two years. He reportedly gave up law after representing a drug dealer whom he knew to be guilty. He won the case by enforcing his client's constitutional right to a speedy trial; the district attorney was not prepared, and the case was dismissed. The case left Glazer feeling guilty and led to his retirement. Poker Glazer had often earned extra money during his education by taking trips to Las Vegas or Atlantic city to play blackjack and poker. After his aborted law career, he resumed this habit while he tried establishing himself as a writer. He soon found himself achieving greater success in poker than in writing. He later met Phil Helmuth at a spiritual place in Northern California called Esalen and they became close friends. His relationship with Hellmuth led to Glazer becoming the tournament reporter for the World Series of Poker. His tournament reports were widely liked for their regard to detail and emotion. Glazer went on to become a columnist for Card Player Magazine and the Detroit Free Press. He also wrote the books Casino Gambling the Smart Way: How to Have More Fun and Win More Money and Complete Idiot's Guide to Poker (The Complete Idiot's Guide). He also helped Phil Hellmuth write Play Poker like the Pros and was mentioned several times in Positively Fifth Street. Right before his death he started writing for finaltablepoker.com. Though better known in the poker community for his writing; Glazer did achieve some success playing in poker tournaments. In 2002 Andy finished 22nd in the World Series of Poker Main Event. In 2003 Andy Glazer finished 6th in the World Poker Tour (WPT) Invitational. In 2004 he won two preliminary tournaments at the Crown Australian Poker Championship. By the time of his death from complications from a blood clot, Detroit Free Press, July 7, 2004 Andy Glazer's total live tournament winnings exceeded $75,000.

Early life Omer Vrioni was a muslim Tosk Albanian from the village of Vrioni near Berat (hence his name), with a distinguished record in the battles in Egypt against Napoleon.Finlay, p. 89. When Ali Pasha revolted against the Sublime Porte, Omer was his treasurer. He initially commanded the army tasked with defending the eastern approaches to Ioannina, but entered into an agreement with Ismail Pasha, the then commander-in-chief of the Sultan's forces, disbanding his army in exchange for the pashalik of Berat.Finlay, pp. 95-96. After the death of Ali Pasha Omer was among the commanders who were sent by Hur≈üid Ahmed Pasha, the new commander-in-chief, to suppress the Greek Revolution which had broken out in March 1821. On April 24, 1821, he defeated the Greeks at the Battle of Alamana and had their commander, Athanasios Diakos, impaled. Vrioni's advance was temporarily halted by Odysseas Androutsos who, with a handful of men, inflicted heavy casualties upon him at the Battle of the inn of Gravia on May 8, 1821. Siege of Missolonghi In late 1822, he and Mehmed Reshid Pasha joined forces to besiege the town of Missolonghi. The town was completely surrounded on October 25, and might have fallen, had the locals left the city. However they resisted heroically and Vrioni resorted to negotiations in order to save his men, against the opinion of Mehmed Reshid and Yussuf Pasha. The besieged Greeks destroyed the morale of the Ottoman army and when they were reinforced by sea the novice Turkish captains and the two pashas scheduled their main assault for Christmas night, December 24, calculating that the Greeks would be caught by surprise. However, the attack failed. Six days later, the siege was lifted. Later career As a result of this failure, the antagonism between Omer Vrioni and Mehmed Reshid escalated, resulting in his recall by the Porte in 1824, when he was assigned a command in Macedonia. During the later Russo-Turkish War of 1828, he led a 20,000 strong army in an unsuccessful attempt to relieve the Siege of Varna. References Sources * Brewer, David. The Greek War of Independence.

It is structurally related to synthetic allylamine antifungals such as terbinafine. Medical uses Butenafine is indicated for the topical treatment of tinea (pityriasis) versicolor due to Malassezia furfur, as well as athlete's foot (Tinea pedis), ringworm (Tinea corporis) and jock itch (Tinea cruris) due to Epidermophyton floccosum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Trichophyton rubrum, and Trichophyton tonsurans. It also displays superior activity against Candida albicans than terbinafine and naftifine. Butenafine demonstrates low minimum inhibitory concentrations against Cryptococcus and Aspergillus. There is some evidence that it is effective against dermatophyte infections of the toenails, but needs to be applied daily for prolonged periods (at least one year). =Typical usage= For 1% cream: * for adults and children 12 years and older:  wash the affected skin with soap and water and dry completely before applying  apply once a day to affected skin for 2 weeks or as directed by a doctor  wash hands after each use * children under 12 years: ask a doctor =Available forms= Butenafine is typically available as a 1% topical cream. Pharmacology Like the allylamine antifungals, butenafine works by inhibiting the synthesis of ergosterol by inhibiting squalene epoxidase, an enzyme responsible for the creation of sterols needed in fungal cell membranes. Lacking ergosterol, the cell membranes increase in permeability, allowing their contents to leak out. Furthermore, inhibition of squalene epoxidase leads to a toxic buildup of squalene. This double action of butenafine (increased membrane permeability and toxic buildup of squalene) makes butenafine fungicidal rather than merely fungistatic. In addition to being an antifungal, butenafine is an anti inflammatory. Because fungal skin infections are often accompanied by significant inflammation, this is a desirable property. The fact that butenafine has intrinsic anti inflammatory properties is also desirable since it is not necessary to add cortical steroids (which decrease the ability to fight infection) to reduce inflammation. Chemistry Butenafine hydrochloride is an odorless white crystalline powder that is freely soluble in methanol, ethanol, and chloroform, and slightly soluble in water.

The Lords held that where a breach of duty has a material effect on the likelihood of injury then the subsequent injury will be said to have been caused by the breach. Facts James McGhee was employed to clean out brick kilns and developed dermatitis from the accumulation of coal dust on his skin. Because there were no shower facilities at his workplace, he would cycle home each day, increasing the risk he would contract dermatitis. Had his employer provided shower facilities, the coal dust could have been washed off before cycling, reducing the risk of contracting dermatitis. Due to the limits of scientific knowledge, it was impossible to rule out the possibility that he hadn't contracted dermatitis during the non-wrongful exposure to brick dust while working in the kiln. He sued his employer for negligence for breaching its duty to provide proper washing facilities. The issue before the House of Lords was whether the failure to provide the washing facilities had caused the rash. Decision The House of Lords held that the risk of harm had been materially increased by the prolonged exposure to the dust. Lord Reid stated: > \\"The medical evidence is to the effect that the fact that the man had to > cycle home caked with grime and sweat added materially to the risk\\" The material increase in risk was treated as equivalent to a material contribution to damage. The implication of the case was significant as it meant that a claimant need not demonstrate that the defendant's actions were the \\"but for\\" cause of the injury, but instead that the defendant's actions materially increased the risk of injury, and thus damage, to the claimant.

The lyrics were written by Grant Clarke and the music was composed by Lewis F. Muir and Maurice Abrahams. It was copyrighted and published in 1912 by F.A. Mills. Artists The song has been recorded by a diverse group of artists, including Bob Roberts (1912), the Tune Wranglers (1936), Pinky Tomlin (1939), Eddy Howard (1947), Jo Stafford (1949), and the Chipmunks (1959). It was also performed by Betty Hutton in the 1945 musical film Incendiary Blonde. Origin Its lyricist and composers, Clarke, Muir, and Abrahams also wrote \\"Second Hand Rose\\". \\"Ragtime Cowboy Joe\\" was composed in Brooklyn after an appearance at the home of Abrahams by his nephew, Joe Abrahams, wearing a cowboy outfit. Maurice Abrahams was so captivated by the appearance of his nephew dressed up as a cowboy that he was inspired to write \\"Ragtime Cowboy Joe\\". It became a number-one hit song for singer Bob Roberts, also the second best-selling record of 1912. Original lyrics As with many popular songs of the era, the verse is often omitted: the refrain's lyrics vary somewhat depending on the performer. (verse) : Out in Arizona : Where the bad men are, : And the only friend to guide you : Is an evening star, : The roughest and the toughest : Man by far : Is Ragtime Cowboy Joe. : He got his name from singin' : To the cows and sheep : They say that every night : He sings the herd to sleep : In a basso voice : So rich and deep, : A-croonin' soft and low. (refrain) : He always sings : Raggy music to the cattle : As he swings : Back and forward in the saddle : On a horse : That's a syncopated gaiter : There's-a such a funny meter : To the roar of his repeater. : How they run : When they hear his gun : Because the Western folks all know : He's a high-falutin', rootin', shootin', : Son of a gun from Arizona, : Ragtime Cowboy Joe. (verse) : Dressed up ev'ry Sunday : In his Sunday clothes : He beats it to the village : Where he always goes : And ev'ry single gal : In town is Joe's : 'Cause he's a ragtime bear. : When he starts a-spieling : On the dance hall floor : No one but a lunatic : Would start a war : Because the wise men know : His forty-four : Would make them dance for fair. Variations include: \\"Where the bad lands are\\", \\"How he sings\\", \\"Ragtime music\\", \\"That's syncopated gaited/And you ought to hear the meter\\", \\"scootin' shootin'\\" or \\"rootin' tootin'\\", \\"Son of a gun from old Wyoming\\", or additions of \\"(A pretty good horse)\\", \\"He's some cowboy\\", and/or \\"Talk about your cowboy\\". On radio \\"Ragtime Cowboy Joe\\" was the radio show theme song for New York City's long running, award-winning public radio show, Cowboy Joe's Radio Ranch (1976‚Äì1988), hosted by Paul Aaron, New York's Cowboy Joe. During one of his radio shows Paul Aaron had the elder Joe Abrahams (the original Cowboy Joe) as a special guest. Paul Aaron played many versions of his favorite song dating back to one sung by Bob Roberts from an RCA Victor 78 rpm record. He also played many \\"live\\" versions recorded during the University of Wyoming football and basketball games. A more recent rendition of the song appears on Dan Hicks and the Hot Licks' 2009 album \\"Tangled Tales\\". College fight songs =University of Wyoming song= \\"Ragtime Cowboy Joe\\" is also the fight song of the University of Wyoming. Traditionally, Cowboy fans stand and clap to the beat of the song as played by Wyoming's Western Thunder Marching Band. The version of the song appropriated by Wyoming was written by Francis Edwin Stroup (1909‚Äì2010) in 1961. He rewrote the chorus. Stroup had been an Assistant Professor of Health and Physical Education for Men at Wyoming until August 31, 1950. He also had composed the fight song for his alma mater, the University of North Texas in 1939, ten years after graduating. The song, \\"Fight, North Texas\\", has endured for years and the lyrics have changed minimally to reflect the name changes of the university. Stroup also composed school songs for Drake University and the University of Chicago. Stroup, while teaching at Northern Illinois University in 1961, also wrote the \\"Huskie Fight Song\\", which was adopted as the university's fight song in 1963. The lyrics Stroup wrote for the University of Wyoming follow: : (for the Cowboys) : C! O! W! B! O! Y! S! : COWBOYS! COWBOYS! COWBOYS! : (for the Cowgirls) : C! O! W! G! I! R! L! S! : COWGIRLS! COWGIRLS! COWGIRLS! =University of California, Davis= The Cal Aggie Marching Band-uh! at University of California, Davis also adapted the song with the following variation: : He's a high-falutin', rootin' tootin' : Son of a gun from California : He's some cowboy : Talk about your cowboy : Ragtime Cowboy Joe The Chipmunks \\"Ragtime Cowboy Joe\\" is the third and final single from the Chipmunks' debut album Let's All Sing with the Chipmunks. The song was released as a single in 1959. The Chipmunks' two prior singles, \\"The Chipmunk Song\\" and \\"Alvin's Harmonica\\", both reached the Top Ten; \\"Ragtime Cowboy Joe\\" peaked at No. 16 on the Billboard Pop Singles Chart. The song was also a success on the Billboard Black Singles, peaking at No. 29. Since the song was also credited to David Seville by Billboard, it became Seville's fourth consecutive Top 20 single. The single also reached No. 11 in the UK singles chart, the first and only Chipmunks song to chart in the UK until 1992's \\"Achy Breaky Heart\\". The B- or flip-side, also written by Bagdasarian, is titled \\"Flip Side\\".

This main complex jail is a \\"direct supervision facility [that] has become a national model for program-oriented prisoner rehabilitation.\\" The second, which acts as the main intake and release facility for the city, was praised by Pulitzer Prize-winning architecture critic Allan Temko as \\"a stunning victory for architectural freedom over bureaucratic stupidity.\\" The first jail established in San Francisco was demanded by the Alcalde, later first mayor John W. Geary and set up in a beached brig the Ephemia on the shore of Yerba Buena Cove. Later there was a jail on Broadway and jails within the two halls of justice on the east side of Portsmouth Square. The fourth floor of the post-earthquake Hall of Justice on Kearney Street served as a jail until 1961, when the present Hall of Justice at 850 Bryant Street opened.

Athanasios Diakos and his band, reinforced by the fighters of Dimitrios Panourgias and Yiannis Dyovouniotis, decided to halt the Ottoman advance into Roumeli by taking defensive positions near Thermopylae. The Greek force of 1,500 men was split into three sections - Dyovouniotis was to defend the bridge at Gorgopotamos, Panourgias the heights of Halkomata, and Diakos the bridge at Alamana.Bopis, Dimitris (2007). \\"ŒëŒ∏Œ±ŒΩŒ¨œÉŒπŒøœÇ ŒîŒπŒ¨Œ∫ŒøœÇ, Œø œÄœÅœéœÑŒøœÇ ŒºŒ¨œÅœÑœÖœÅŒ±œÇ œÑŒøœÖ Œ±Œ≥œéŒΩŒ±\\" [Athanasios Diakos, the first martyr of the struggle].

Setting out from their camp at Lianokladi, near Lamia, the Ottoman Turks soon divided their force. The main force attacked Diakos, the other attacked Dyovouniotis, whose force was quickly routed, and then Panourgias, whose men retreated when he was wounded. The majority of the Greek force having fled, the Ottomans concentrated their attack on Diakos's position at the Alamana bridge. Seeing that it was a matter of time before they were overrun by the enemy, Bousgos, who had been fighting alongside Diakos, pleaded with him to retreat to safety. Diakos chose to stay and fight with 48 men; they put up a desperate hand-to- hand struggle for a number of hours before being overwhelmed. Diakos, wounded in the battle, was captured after his sword broke.Bopis, Dimitris (2007). \\"ŒëŒ∏Œ±ŒΩŒ¨œÉŒπŒøœÇ ŒîŒπŒ¨Œ∫ŒøœÇ, Œø œÄœÅœéœÑŒøœÇ ŒºŒ¨œÅœÑœÖœÅŒ±œÇ œÑŒøœÖ Œ±Œ≥œéŒΩŒ±\\" [Athanasios Diakos, the first martyr of the struggle].

Diakos immediately refused and replied: > \\"I was born a Greek and I will die a Greek\\". Vrioni then ordered that Diakos be impaled.Brewer, D. The Greek War of Independence, p. 86. The Overlook Press, 2001. . The Ottomans tried to make Diakos carry the sharpened pole, but he threw it down with contempt. As he was led off to be impaled, it was said that onlookers heard him sing: > \\"Look at the time Charon chose to take me, now that branches are flowering, > now that the earth sends forth grass\\".Paparigopoulos, K, History of the > Greek Nation (Greek edition), vol. 6, p. 62 Diakos's song was in reference to the Greeks' uprising against the Ottoman Empire. One popular version mentions that Diakos was also roasted over a fire, however, this is questionable because of another local, oral tradition that has him being killed by a Greek rebel the next day out of mercy, as he was found to be in a near-death state from the impalement. Aftermath Even though the battle was ultimately a military defeat for the Greeks, Diakos's death provided the Greek national cause with a stirring myth of heroic martyrdom.

Early life and career Robie was born in Burlington, Vermont, the son of Jacob and Louisa (Dunham) Robie. He was educated at the local academy in Binghamton, New York, where he was awarded a scholarship prize and a warrant as an assistant engineer in the United States Navy in 1852. He was Third Assistant Engineer on the frigate USS Mississippi, flagship of Commodore Matthew Perry's historic expedition to Japan from 1852 to 1855, which opened up that nation to the world for the first time. In 1857, now Second Assistant Engineer, he was ordered to the frigate USS Susquehanna, which was involved in the first, albeit unsuccessful, attempt to lay a transatlantic telegraph cable across the Atlantic Ocean, from Newfoundland to Ireland. He was promoted to First Assistant Engineer in 1858, and was ordered to the USS Niagara, which made a round-trip voyage late that year to Monrovia, Liberia, transporting slaves liberated in August when a slave ship was captured off Cuba by another U.S. warship. Just prior to Robie's arrival on the ship, the Niagara had participated in the second attempt, this time successful, to lay the Transatlantic telegraph cable. His next assignment was as First Assistant Engineer aboard the steam sloop USS Lancaster. Lancaster, flagship of the Pacific Squadron, was cruising in the Marquesas Islands (French Polynesia) when the Civil War started, and did not find out about the outbreak of hostilities until it arrived in Hawaii, two months later. Civil War President Abraham Lincoln signed Edward Robie's commission as Chief Engineer in September 1861, and Robie went to sea again, this time on the steam sloop USS Mohican. The Mohican was involved in the capture of forts at Port Royal, South Carolina and Fernandina, Florida, and on blockading duty off Charleston, South Carolina. He subsequently served as Senior Engineer of the North Atlantic Squadron, superintended the construction of the iron-clad ram USS Dictator in 1862-3, served on the steam ship Ericsson in 1864, and USS Dictator in 1864 and 1865. That year, he also served on the Engineer Board of Examiners. Postwar career In 1866, Robie sailed to the Pacific aboard USS Ossipee, via the Strait of Magellan. On arriving in Panama, he was promoted to Fleet Engineer on board the flagship USS Pensacola. In 1869, he served on a commission headed by Rear Admiral Louis M. Goldsborough that condemned the design of USS Wampanoag, contained numerous design features unprecedented in American naval construction. Robie was stationed at the Boston Navy Yard in 1870 and 1871, then ordered to USS Wabash, which sailed the Mediterranean Sea. He improved a steam steering engine for that frigate, which was the first successful steam steerer used in the Navy. Robie later served for a time as Fleet Engineer on the North Atlantic and Gulf Squadrons, and from 1874 to 1877, was Chief Engineer of the Norfolk Navy Yard. Later duties included special inspection duty at Pitsburg, Ohio and the Cold Spring Foundry in New York, Fleet Engineer in the Pacific on the flagship USS Pensacola, Chief Engineer at Boston, then New York and finally Norfolk Navy yards. His last tour of duty was with the Navy Department in Washington, D.C., where he remained until forced to retire due to his age, on September 11, 1893. He had served nearly 17 years at sea and more than 21¬Ω years ashore. Robie retired with the rank of commodore, but an act of Congress in 1906 promoted him to rear admiral in appreciation for his services during the Civil War. Rear Admiral Robie was buried at Arlington National Cemetery on June 9, 1911.

C. Siva Ram Murthy and B. S. Manoj, Ad hoc Wireless Networks: Architectures and Protocols, Prentice Hall PTR, May 2004. The network is ad hoc because it does not rely on a pre-existing infrastructure, such as routers in wired networks or access points in managed (infrastructure) wireless networks. Instead, each node participates in routing by forwarding data for other nodes, so the determination of which nodes forward data is made dynamically on the basis of network connectivity and the routing algorithm in use. In the Windows operating system, ad hoc is a communication mode (setting) that allows computers to directly communicate with each other without a router. Wireless mobile ad hoc networks are self- configuring, dynamic networks in which nodes are free to move. Such wireless networks lack the complexities of infrastructure setup and administration, enabling devices to create and join networks \\"on the fly\\" ‚Äì anywhere, anytime.Chai Keong Toh. Ad Hoc Mobile Wireless Networks. United States: Prentice Hall Publishers, 2002. A true MANET by definition requires multicast routing, not just unicast or broadcast.https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/101/materials/slides-101-pim- manet-mfib-work-00 Each device in a MANET is free to move independently in any direction, and will therefore change its links to other devices frequently. Each must forward traffic unrelated to its own use, and therefore be a router. The primary challenge in building a MANET is equipping each device to continuously maintain the information required to properly route traffic. This becomes harder as the scale of the MANET increases due to 1) the desire to route packets to/through every other node, 2) the percentage of overhead traffic needed to maintain real-time routing status, 3) each node has its own goodput to route independent and unaware of others needs, and 4) all must share limited communication bandwidth, such as a slice of radio spectrum. Such networks may operate by themselves or may be connected to the larger Internet. They may contain one or multiple and different transceivers between nodes. This results in a highly dynamic, autonomous topology. MANETs usually have a routable networking environment on top of a Link Layer ad hoc network. MANETs consist of a peer-to-peer, self-forming, self-healing network. MANETs circa 2000‚Äì2015 typically communicate at radio frequencies (30 MHz ‚Äì 5 GHz).  History on packet radio  Stanford Research Institute's Packet Radio Van, site of the first three-way internetworked transmission. Initial, large- scale trials of the Near-term digital radio, February 1998. The earliest wireless data network was called PRNET, the packet radio network, and was sponsored by Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) in the early 1970s. Bolt, Beranek and Newman Inc. (BBN) and SRI International designed, built, and experimented with these earliest systems. Experimenters included Robert Kahn, Jerry Burchfiel, and Ray Tomlinson. Similar experiments took place in the amateur radio community with the x25 protocol. These early packet radio systems predated the Internet, and indeed were part of the motivation of the original Internet Protocol suite. Later DARPA experiments included the Survivable Radio Network (SURAN) project, which took place in the 1980s. A successor to these systems was fielded in the mid-1990s for the US Army, and later other nations, as the Near-term digital radio. Another third wave of academic and research activity started in the mid-1990s with the advent of inexpensive 802.11 radio cards for personal computers. Current wireless ad hoc networks are designed primarily for military utility.American Radio Relay League. \\"ARRL's VHF Digital Handbook\\", p 1-2, American Radio Relay League,2008 Problems with packet radios are: (1) bulky elements, (2) slow data rate, (3) unable to maintain links if mobility is high. The project did not proceed much further until the early 1990s when wireless ad hoc networks are born.  Early work on MANET  The growth of laptops and 802.11/Wi-Fi wireless networking have made MANETs a popular research topic since the mid-1990s. Many academic papers evaluate protocols and their abilities, assuming varying degrees of mobility within a bounded space, usually with all nodes within a few hops of each other. Different protocols are then evaluated based on measures such as the packet drop rate, the overhead introduced by the routing protocol, end-to- end packet delays, network throughput, ability to scale, etc. In the early 1990s, Charles Perkins from SUN Microsystems USA, and Chai Keong Toh from Cambridge University separately started to work on a different Internet, that of a wireless ad hoc network. Perkins was working on the dynamic addressing issues. Toh worked on a new routing protocol, which was known as ABR ‚Äì associativity-based routing.Chai Keong Toh Associativity-Based Routing for Ad Hoc Mobile Networks, Wireless Personal Communications Journal, 1997. Perkins eventually proposed DSDV ‚Äì Destination Sequence Distance Vector routing, which was based on distributed distance vector routing. Toh's proposal was an on- demand based routing, i.e. routes are discovered on-the-fly in real-time as and when needed. ABRChai Keong Toh IETF MANET DRAFT: Long-lived Ad Hoc Routing based on the Concept of Associativity was submitted to IETF as RFCs. ABR was implemented successfully into Linux OS on Lucent WaveLAN 802.11a enabled laptops and a practical ad hoc mobile network was therefore proven to be possible in 1999. Another routing protocol known as AODV was subsequently introduced and later proven and implemented in 2005.\\"AODV Implementation Design and Performance Evaluation\\" by Ian D. Chakeres In 2007, David Johnson and Dave Maltz proposed DSR ‚Äì Dynamic Source Routing.The Dynamic Source Routing Protocol (DSR) for Mobile Ad Hoc Networks for IPv4  Applications  The decentralized nature of wireless ad hoc networks makes them suitable for a variety of applications where central nodes can't be relied on and may improve the scalability of networks compared to wireless managed networks, though theoretical and practical limits to the overall capacity of such networks have been identified. Minimal configuration and quick deployment make ad hoc networks suitable for emergency situations like natural disasters or military conflicts. The presence of dynamic and adaptive routing protocols enables ad hoc networks to be formed quickly. Wireless ad hoc networks can be further classified by their applications: = Mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) = A mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is a continuously self-configuring, self- organizing, infrastructure-less network of mobile devices connected without wires. It is sometimes known as \\"on-the-fly\\" networks or \\"spontaneous networks\\".  Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs)  VANETs are used for communication between vehicles and roadside equipment. Intelligent vehicular ad hoc networks (InVANETs) are a kind of artificial intelligence that helps vehicles to behave in intelligent manners during vehicle-to-vehicle collisions, accidents. Vehicles are using radio waves to communicate with each other, creating communication networks instantly on-the-fly while vehicles move along roads.  Smartphone ad hoc networks (SPANs)  A SPAN leverages existing hardware (primarily Wi-Fi and Bluetooth) and software (protocols) in commercially available smartphones to create peer-to-peer networks without relying on cellular carrier networks, wireless access points, or traditional network infrastructure. SPANs differ from traditional hub and spoke networks, such as Wi-Fi Direct, in that they support multi-hop relays and there is no notion of a group leader so peers can join and leave at will without destroying the network. Most recently, Apple's iPhone with version 8.4 iOS and higher have been enabled with multi-peer ad hoc mesh networking capability, in iPhones, allowing millions of smart phones to create ad hoc networks without relying on cellular communications. It has been claimed that this is going to \\"change the world\\". iMANETs Internet-based mobile ad hoc networks (iMANETs) is a type of wireless ad hoc network that supports Internet protocols such as TCP/UDP and IP. The network uses a network-layer routing protocol to link mobile nodes and establish routes distributedly and automatically.  Wireless mesh networks  Mesh networks take their name from the topology of the resultant network. In a fully connected mesh, each node is connected to every other node, forming a \\"mesh\\". A partial mesh, by contrast, has a topology in which some nodes are not connected to others, although this term is seldom in use. Wireless ad hoc networks can take the form of a mesh networks or others. A wireless ad hoc network does not have fixed topology, and its connectivity among nodes is totally dependent on the behavior of the devices, their mobility patterns, distance with each other, etc. Hence, wireless mesh networks are a particular type of wireless ad hoc networks, with special emphasis on the resultant network topology. While some wireless mesh networks (particularly those within a home) have relatively infrequent mobility and thus infrequent link breaks, other more mobile mesh networks require frequent routing adjustments to account for lost links. Google Home, Google Wi-Fi, and Google OnHub all support Wi-Fi mesh (i.e., Wi- Fi ad hoc) networking. Apple's AirPort allows the formation of wireless mesh networks at home, connecting various Wi-Fi devices together and providing good wireless coverage and connectivity at home.  Army tactical MANETs  Military or tactical MANETs are used by military units with emphasis on data rate, real-time requirement, fast re-routing during mobility, data security, radio range, and integration with existing systems. Common radio waveforms include the US Army's JTRS SRW and Persistent System's WaveRelay. Ad hoc mobile communications come in well to fulfill this need, especially its infrastructureless nature, fast deployment and operation. Military MANETs are used by military units with emphasis on rapid deployment, infrastructureless, all-wireless networks (no fixed radio towers), robustness (link breaks are no problem), security, range, and instant operation. MANETs can be used in army \\"hopping\\" mines, in platoons where soldiers communicate in foreign terrains, giving them superiority in the battlefield. Tactical MANETs can be formed automatically during the mission and the network \\"disappears\\" when the mission is over or decommissioned. It is sometimes called \\"on-the-fly\\" wireless tactical network.  Air Force UAV Ad hoc networks  Flying ad hoc networks (FANETs) are composed of unmanned aerial vehicles, allowing great mobility and providing connectivity to remote areas. Unmanned aerial vehicle, is an aircraft with no pilot on board. UAVs can be remotely controlled (i.e., flown by a pilot at a ground control station) or can fly autonomously based on pre-programmed flight plans. Civilian usage of UAV include modeling 3D terrains, package delivery (Amazon), etc. UAVs have also been used by US Air Force for data collection and situation sensing, without risking the pilot in a foreign unfriendly environment. With wireless ad hoc network technology embedded into the UAVs, multiple UAVs can communicate with each other and work as a team, collaboratively to complete a task and mission. If a UAV is destroyed by an enemy, its data can be quickly offloaded wirelessly to other neighboring UAVs. The UAV ad hoc communication network is also sometimes referred to UAV instant sky network.  Navy ad hoc networks  Navy ships traditionally use satellite communications and other maritime radios to communicate with each other or with ground station back on land. However, such communications are restricted by delays and limited bandwidth. Wireless ad hoc networks enable ship-area-networks to be formed while at sea, enabling high speed wireless communications among ships, enhancing their sharing of imaging and multimedia data, and better co-ordination in battlefield operations. Some defense companies (such as Rockwell Collins and Rohde & Schwartz) have produced products that enhance ship-to-ship and ship-to-shore communications.  Wireless sensor networks  Sensors are useful devices that collect information related to a specific parameter, such as noise, temperature, humidity, pressure, etc. Sensors are increasingly connected via wireless to allow large scale collection of sensor data. With a large sample of sensor data, analytics processing can be used to make sense out of these data. The connectivity of wireless sensor networks rely on the principles behind wireless ad hoc networks, since sensors can now be deploy without any fixed radio towers, and they can now form networks on-the-fly. \\"Smart Dust\\" was one of the early projects done at U C Berkeley, where tiny radios were used to interconnect smart dust. More recently, mobile wireless sensor networks (MWSNs) have also become an area of academic interest.  Ad hoc home smart lighting  ZigBee is a low power form of wireless ad hoc networks that is now finding their way in home automation. Its low power consumption, robustness and extended range inherent in mesh networking can deliver several advantages for smart lighting in homes and in offices. The control includes adjusting dimmable lights, color lights, and color or scene. The networks allow a set or subset of lights to be controlled over a smart phone or via a computer. The home automation market is tipped to exceed $16 billion by 2019.  Ad hoc street light networks  Wireless ad hoc smart street light networks are beginning to evolve. The concept is to use wireless control of city street lights for better energy efficiency, as part of a smart city architectural feature., Telensa, UK Multiple street lights form a wireless ad hoc network. A single gateway device can control up to 500 street lights. Using the gateway device, one can turn individual lights ON, OFF or dim them, as well as find out which individual light is faulty and in need of maintenance.  Ad hoc network of robots  Robots are mechanical systems that drive automation and perform chores that would seem difficult for man. Efforts have been made to co-ordinate and control a group of robots to undertake collaborative work to complete a task. Centralized control is often based on a \\"star\\" approach, where robots take turns to talk to the controller station. However, with wireless ad hoc networks, robots can form a communication network on-the-fly, i.e., robots can now \\"talk\\" to each other and collaborate in a distributed fashion. With a network of robots, the robots can communicate among themselves, share local information, and distributively decide how to resolve a task in the most effective and efficient way.  Disaster rescue ad hoc network  Another civilian use of wireless ad hoc network is public safety. At times of disasters (floods, storms, earthquakes, fires, etc.), a quick and instant wireless communication network is necessary. Especially at times of earthquakes when radio towers had collapsed or were destroyed, wireless ad hoc networks can be formed independently. Firemen and rescue workers can use ad hoc networks to communicate and rescue those injured. Commercial radios with such capability are available on the market.  Hospital ad hoc network  Wireless ad hoc networks allow sensors, videos, instruments, and other devices to be deployed and interconnected wirelessly for clinic and hospital patient monitoring, doctor and nurses alert notification, and also making senses of such data quickly at fusion points, so that lives can be saved. Data monitoring and mining MANETS can be used for facilitating the collection of sensor data for data mining for a variety of applications such as air pollution monitoring and different types of architectures can be used for such applications. A key characteristic of such applications is that nearby sensor nodes monitoring an environmental feature typically register similar values. This kind of data redundancy due to the spatial correlation between sensor observations inspires the techniques for in-network data aggregation and mining. By measuring the spatial correlation between data sampled by different sensors, a wide class of specialized algorithms can be developed to develop more efficient spatial data mining algorithms as well as more efficient routing strategies. Also, researchers have developed performance models for MANET to apply queueing theory.  Challenges  Several books and works have revealed the technical and research challenges facing wireless ad hoc networks or MANETs. The advantages for users, the technical difficulties in implementation, and the side effect on radio spectrum pollution can be briefly summarized below: = Advantages for users = The obvious appeal of MANETs is that the network is decentralised and nodes/devices are mobile, that is to say there is no fixed infrastructure which provides the possibility for numerous applications in different areas such as environmental monitoring [1], [2], disaster relief [3]‚Äì[5] and military communications [3]. Since the early 2000s interest in MANETs has greatly increased which, in part, is due to the fact mobility can improve network capacity, shown by Grossglauser and Tse along with the introduction of new technologies. One main advantage to a decentralised network is that they are typically more robust than centralised networks due to the multi-hop fashion in which information is relayed. For example, in the cellular network setting, a drop in coverage occurs if a base station stops working, however the chance of a single point of failure in a MANET is reduced significantly since the data can take multiple paths. Since the MANET architecture evolves with time it has the potential to resolve issues such as isolation/disconnection from the network. Further advantages of MANETS over networks with a fixed topology include flexibility (an ad hoc network can be created anywhere with mobile devices), scalability (you can easily add more nodes to the network) and lower administration costs (no need to build an infrastructure first). In summary: *Highly performing network. *No expensive infrastructure must be installed *Quick distribution of information around sender *No single point of failure. *multi hop *scalability = Implementation difficulties = With a time evolving network it is clear we should expect variations in network performance due to no fixed architecture (no fixed connections). Furthermore, since network topology determines interference and thus connectivity, the mobility pattern of devices within the network will impact on network performance, possibly resulting in data having to be resent a lot of times (increased delay) and finally allocation of network resources such as power remains unclear. Finally, finding a model that accurately represents human mobility whilst remaining mathematically tractable remains an open problem due to the large range of factors that influence it. Some typical models used include the random walk, random waypoint and levy flight models. In summary: *All network entities may be mobile, so a very dynamic topology is needed. *Network functions must have a high degree of adaptability. *There are no central entities, so operations must be managed in a completely distributed manner. *Battery constraints = Side effects = *Use of unlicensed frequency spectrum, contributing to radio spectrum pollution.  Radios and Modulation  Wireless ad hoc networks can operate over different types of radios. All radios use modulation to move information over a certain bandwidth of radio frequencies. Given the need to move large amounts of information quickly over long distances, a MANET radio channel ideally has large bandwidth (e.g. amount of radio spectrum), lower frequencies, and higher power. Given the desire to communicate with many other nodes ideally simultaneously, many channels are needed. Given radio spectrum is shared and regulated, there is less bandwidth available at lower frequencies. Processing many radio channels requires many resources. Given the need for mobility, small size and lower power consumption are very important. Picking a MANET radio and modulation has many trade-offs; many start with the specific frequency and bandwidth they are allowed to use. Radios can be UHF (300 ‚Äì 3000 MHz), SHF (3 ‚Äì 30 GHz), and EHF (30 ‚Äì 300 GHz). Wi-Fi ad hoc uses the unlicensed ISM 2.4 GHz radios. They can also be used on 5.8 GHz radios. The higher the frequency, such as those of 300 GHz, absorption of the signal will be more predominant. Army tactical radios usually employ a variety of UHF and SHF radios, including those of VHF to provide a variety of communication modes. At the 800, 900, 1200, 1800 MHz range, cellular radios are predominant. Some cellular radios use ad hoc communications to extend cellular range to areas and devices not reachable by the cellular base station. Next generation Wi-Fi known as 802.11ax provides low delay, high capacity (up to 10Gbit/s) and low packet loss rate, offering 12 streams ‚Äì 8 streams at 5 GHz and 4 streams at 2.4 GHz. IEEE 802.11ax uses 8x8 MU-MIMO, OFDMA, and 80 MHz channels. Hence, 802.11ax has the ability to form high capacity Wi-Fi ad hoc networks. At 60 GHz, there is another form of Wi-Fi known as WiGi ‚Äì wireless gigabit. This has the ability to offer up to 7Gbit/s throughput. Currently, WiGi is targeted to work with 5G cellular networks. Circa 2020, the general consensus finds the 'best' modulation for moving information over higher frequency waves to be Orthogonal_frequency- division_multiplexing, as used in 4G LTE, 5G, and Wi-Fi.  Protocol stack  The challenges affecting MANETs span from various layers of the OSI protocol stack. The media access layer (MAC) has to be improved to resolve collisions and hidden terminal problems. The network layer routing protocol has to be improved to resolve dynamically changing network topologies and broken routes. The transport layer protocol has to be improved to handle lost or broken connections. The session layer protocol has to deal with discovery of servers and services. A major limitation with mobile nodes is that they have high mobility, causing links to be frequently broken and reestablished. Moreover, the bandwidth of a wireless channel is also limited, and nodes operate on limited battery power, which will eventually be exhausted. These factors make the design of a mobile ad hoc network challenging. The cross-layer design deviates from the traditional network design approach in which each layer of the stack would be made to operate independently. The modified transmission power will help that node to dynamically vary its propagation range at the physical layer. This is because the propagation distance is always directly proportional to transmission power. This information is passed from the physical layer to the network layer so that it can take optimal decisions in routing protocols. A major advantage of this protocol is that it allows access of information between physical layer and top layers (MAC and network layer). Some elements of the software stack were developed to allow code updates in situ, i.e., with the nodes embedded in their physical environment and without needing to bring the nodes back into the lab facility. Such software updating relied on epidemic mode of dissemination of information and had to be done both efficiently (few network transmissions) and fast.  Routing  Routing in wireless ad hoc networks or MANETs generally falls into three categories, namely: (a) proactive routing, (b) reacting routing, and (c) hybrid routing. = Proactive routing = This type of protocols maintains fresh lists of destinations and their routes by periodically distributing routing tables throughout the network. The main disadvantages of such algorithms are: *Respective amount of data for maintenance. *Slow reaction on restructuring and failures. Example: Optimized Link State Routing Protocol (OLSR)  Distance vector routing  As in a fix net nodes maintain routing tables. Distance-vector protocols are based on calculating the direction and distance to any link in a network. \\"Direction\\" usually means the next hop address and the exit interface. \\"Distance\\" is a measure of the cost to reach a certain node. The least cost route between any two nodes is the route with minimum distance. Each node maintains a vector (table) of minimum distance to every node. The cost of reaching a destination is calculated using various route metrics. RIP uses the hop count of the destination whereas IGRP takes into account other information such as node delay and available bandwidth. = Reactive routing = This type of protocol finds a route based on user and traffic demand by flooding the network with Route Request or Discovery packets. The main disadvantages of such algorithms are: *High latency time in route finding. *Excessive flooding can lead to network clogging.C. Perkins, E. Royer and S. Das: Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV) Routing, However, clustering can be used to limit flooding. The latency incurred during route discovery is not significant compared to periodic route update exchanges by all nodes in the network. Example: Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector Routing (AODV)  Flooding  Is a simple routing algorithm in which every incoming packet is sent through every outgoing link except the one it arrived on. Flooding is used in bridging and in systems such as Usenet and peer-to- peer file sharing and as part of some routing protocols, including OSPF, DVMRP, and those used in wireless ad hoc networks. = Hybrid routing = This type of protocol combines the advantages of proactive and reactive routing. The routing is initially established with some proactively prospected routes and then serves the demand from additionally activated nodes through reactive flooding. The choice of one or the other method requires predetermination for typical cases. The main disadvantages of such algorithms are: #Advantage depends on number of other nodes activated. #Reaction to traffic demand depends on gradient of traffic volume.Roger Wattenhofer. Algorithms for Ad Hoc Networks. Example: Zone Routing Protocol (ZRP) = Position-based routing = Position-based routing methods use information on the exact locations of the nodes. This information is obtained for example via a GPS receiver. Based on the exact location the best path between source and destination nodes can be determined. Example: \\"Location-Aided Routing in mobile ad hoc networks\\" (LAR)  Technical requirements for implementation  An ad hoc network is made up of multiple \\"nodes\\" connected by \\"links.\\" Links are influenced by the node's resources (e.g., transmitter power, computing power and memory) and behavioral properties (e.g., reliability), as well as link properties (e.g. length-of- link and signal loss, interference and noise). Since links can be connected or disconnected at any time, a functioning network must be able to cope with this dynamic restructuring, preferably in a way that is timely, efficient, reliable, robust, and scalable. The network must allow any two nodes to communicate by relaying the information via other nodes. A \\"path\\" is a series of links that connects two nodes. Various routing methods use one or two paths between any two nodes; flooding methods use all or most of the available paths.Wu S.L., Tseng Y.C., \\"Wireless Ad Hoc Networking, Auerbach Publications\\", 2007  Medium-access control  In most wireless ad hoc networks, the nodes compete for access to shared wireless medium, often resulting in collisions (interference). Collisions can be handled using centralized scheduling or distributed contention access protocols. Using cooperative wireless communications improves immunity to interference by having the destination node combine self-interference and other-node interference to improve decoding of the desired signals.  Software reprogramming  Large-scale ad hoc wireless networks may be deployed for long periods of time. During this time the requirements from the network or the environment in which the nodes are deployed may change. This can require modifying the application executing on the sensor nodes, or providing the application with a different set of parameters. It may be very difficult to manually reprogram the nodes because of the scale (possibly hundreds of nodes) and the embedded nature of the deployment, since the nodes may be located in places that are difficult to access physically. Therefore, the most relevant form of reprogramming is remote multihop reprogramming using the wireless medium which reprograms the nodes as they are embedded in their sensing environment. Specialized protocols have been developed for the embedded nodes which minimize the energy consumption of the process as well as reaching the entire network with high probability in as short a time as possible.  Simulation  One key problem in wireless ad hoc networks is foreseeing the variety of possible situations that can occur. As a result, modeling and simulation (M&S;) using extensive parameter sweeping and what-if analysis becomes an extremely important paradigm for use in ad hoc networks. One solution is the use of simulation tools like OPNET, NetSim or ns2. A comparative study of various simulators for VANETs reveal that factors such as constrained road topology, multi-path fading and roadside obstacles, traffic flow models, trip models, varying vehicular speed and mobility, traffic lights, traffic congestion, drivers' behavior, etc., have to be taken into consideration in the simulation process to reflect realistic conditions. = Emulation testbed = In 2009, the U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL) and Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) developed a Mobile Ad-Hoc Network emulation testbed, where algorithms and applications were subjected to representative wireless network conditions. The testbed was based on a version of the \\"MANE\\" (Mobile Ad hoc Network Emulator) software originally developed by NRL. ARL, NRL and Consulting & Engineering Next Generation Networks (CENGN) later expanded the original testbed to form eMANE, which provided a system capable of modeling network systems with complex, heterogeneous connectivity (i.e. multiple, different radio interfaces). = Mathematical models = The traditional model is the random geometric graph. Early work included simulating ad hoc mobile networks on sparse and densely connected topologies. Nodes are firstly scattered in a constrained physical space randomly. Each node then has a predefined fixed cell size (radio range). A node is said to be connected to another node if this neighbor is within its radio range. Nodes are then moved (migrated away) based on a random model, using random walk or brownian motion. Different mobility and number of nodes present yield different route length and hence different number of multi-hops. A randomly constructed geometric graph drawn inside a square These are graphs consisting of a set of nodes placed according to a point process in some usually bounded subset of the n-dimensional plane, mutually coupled according to a boolean probability mass function of their spatial separation (see e.g. unit disk graphs). The connections between nodes may have different weights to model the difference in channel attenuations. One can then study network observables (such as connectivity, centrality or the degree distribution ) from a graph- theoretic perspective. One can further study network protocols and algorithms to improve network throughput and fairness.  Security  Most wireless ad hoc networks do not implement any network access control, leaving these networks vulnerable to resource consumption attacks where a malicious node injects packets into the network with the goal of depleting the resources of the nodes relaying the packets. To thwart or prevent such attacks, it was necessary to employ authentication mechanisms that ensure that only authorized nodes can inject traffic into the network. Even with authentication, these networks are vulnerable to packet dropping or delaying attacks, whereby an intermediate node drops the packet or delays it, rather than promptly sending it to the next hop. In a multicast and dynamic environment, establishing temporary 1:1 secure 'sessions' using PKI with every other node is not feasible (like is done with HTTPS, most VPNs, etc. at the transport layer). Instead, a common solution is to use pre-shared keys for symmetric, authenticated encryption at the link layer, for example MACsec using AES-256-GCM. With this method, every properly formatted packet received is authenticated then passed along for decryption or dropped. It also means the key(s) in each node must be changed more often and simultaneously (e.g. to avoid reusing an IV). = Trust management = Trust establishment and management in MANETs face challenges due to resource constraints and the complex interdependency of networks. Managing trust in a MANET needs to consider the interactions between the composite cognitive, social, information and communication networks, and take into account the resource constraints (e.g., computing power, energy, bandwidth, time), and dynamics (e.g., topology changes, node mobility, node failure, propagation channel conditions). Researchers of trust management in MANET suggested that such complex interactions require a composite trust metric that captures aspects of communications and social networks, and corresponding trust measurement, trust distribution, and trust management schemes. Continuous monitoring of every node within a MANET is necessary for trust and reliability but difficult because it by definition is dis-continuous, 2) it requires input from the node itself and 3) from its 'nearby' peers.

It was concluded on 10 June 1935, two years prior to the outbreak of general hostilities in the Second Sino-Japanese War.  Background  Since 1931, Japan had been provoking numerous incidents and violating Chinese sovereignty. The Tanggu Truce established a demilitarized zone between Japanese-occupied territories and North China in 1933, but conflict continued unabated via proxy armies in Inner Mongolia. However, with the appointment of K≈çki Hirota as Foreign Minister of Japan, the Japanese civilian government attempted to improve Sino-Japanese relations, and on 22 January 1935, Japan announced a policy of nonaggression against China. In response, Wang Jingwei of the Chinese government announced a suspension of the Chinese boycott of Japanese goods, and the two countries agreed to upgrade relations to the ambassadorial level. However, the improved relations between Japan and China were counter to the aims of the Japanese Kwantung Army for further territorial expansion. On 29 May 1935, General Takashi Sakai, Chief of Staff of the Japanese China Garrison Army based in Tianjin, acting on the pretext that two pro-Japanese heads of a local news service had been assassinated, raised a formal protest to Kuomintang General He Yingqin, Acting Chairman of the Peiping National Military Council. The Japanese Army demanded: * [1] That Hebei Provincial Chairman General Yu Xuezhong be dismissed from his posts. * [2] That the Kuomintang cease all political activities in Hebei, including the cities of Tianjin and Beijing (Peiping). On 30 May, Japanese armored forces paraded in front of the Chinese government offices in a show of force, and on 4 June, Sakai repeated his demands and threatened drastic action if the demands were not agreed to in full. However, on 5 June, additional demands were added: * [3] That Tianjin Mayor Chang Ting-ngo and Chief of Police Lee Chun-hsiang be replaced, and that Commander of the 3rd Military Police Regiment Chiang Hsiao-hsien, and Director of the Political Training Department Ts'eng Kwang-ching also be relieved. * [4] That the all Kuomintang military forces withdraw from Hebei. * [5] That all anti-Japanese organizations, especially the Blue Shirts Society be disbanded throughout China. * [6] That the assassins of the heads of the pro-Japanese news services be apprehended and dealt with, and that compensation be paid to the families of the victims. On 7 June, forward units of the Kwantung Army moved to the front lines at the Great Wall. A verbal ultimatum was issued on 9 June, with a deadline for compliance set of 12 June. Not prepared at the time to go to war with Japan when his forces were still tied down in a campaign to exterminate the Chinese Communist Party, Chiang Kai-shek agreed to comply. The agreement was between General Yoshijir≈ç Umezu, Commander in chief of the Kwantung Army for Japan and He Yingqin for China. Aftermath The agreement gave Japan virtual control over the province of Hebei, under the aegis of the East Hebei Autonomous Council. Although the Agreement was reached in secret, its details were soon leaked to the press, causing an upsurge in indignation and anti-Japanese sentiment in China. The truce lasted until 7 July 1937, with the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War.

It was officially opened to traffic on 11 November 1895 and named in honour of the NSW Governor Sir Henry Robert Brand, 2nd Viscount Hampden. The bridge carried the Olympic Highway, formerly the Olympic Way, between 1963 until the bridge's closure to highway traffic in October 1995, replaced by the Wiradjuri Bridge. The Hampden Bridge was subsequently converted to local traffic use, then pedestrian use only, and finally demolished in 2014. Former structure The Hampden Bridge was long with each of the three truss spans long. Hampden Bridge was the first large overhead-braced truss bridge designed by Percy Allan. The bridge was originally designed to be a steel-built bridge; however, the tenders were too expensive so timber was used as an alternative. The Hampden Bridge replaced the earlier bridge operated by the Wagga Wagga Bridge Company, a toll bridge over the Murrumbidgee River that operated between 1862 and 1895. The Roads and Traffic Authority handed over the Hampden Bridge to the Wagga Wagga City Council after the bridge was closed to traffic in October 1995. The local historic landmark remained open to pedestrians as a route between the suburb of North Wagga and the city centre until its closure in 2006. In 2012, Wagga Wagga City Council voted to demolish the bridge, as the maintenance costs associated with its preservation were too high. The issue of whether to keep the bridge or to demolish it divided the local community. On 20 August 2014, the bridge was demolished using an induced collapse method with the use of explosives. Design of the Hampden Bridge History The Hampden Bridge opened on 11 November 1895. In October 1995, just short of its 100th birthday, the Hampden Bridge was closed to traffic when the nearby Wiradjuri Bridge opened, on a similar alignment. On 16 August 2006 the Hampden Bridge was closed to pedestrians indefinitely after the Wagga Wagga City Council found that the bridge deck had dropped after one of the trusses failed. A safety report by the Roads and Traffic Authority stated that the bridge could fall down any day due to it being in a state of disrepair. Wagga Wagga City Council looked into ways to prop up the failed section with other options of possibly demolishing the bridge. On 25 August 2006 Wagga Wagga City Council reports that it could cost for emergency stabilisation with other costs such as A$10,000 or more for a structural assessment and A$25,000 to prepare for tenders for the repairs to make the Hampden Bridge safe. Several days later at the monthly meeting of the Wagga Wagga City Council it was decided to commence emergency stabilisation work, a structural soundness assessment, heritage assessment and costs into demolition of the bridge. Cr Peter Dale argued that demolition was the only option since keeping the Hampden Bridge would cost the Wagga Wagga City Council hundreds of thousands of dollars to maintain after an engineer looked at the bridge and estimated that the cost for repairs would be A$100,000. One month later the Wagga Wagga City Council approved A$30,000 from cash reserves for repairs or for demolition of the bridge. A report by Harry Trueman from the Institute of Engineers Australia stated that the Hampden Bridge is one of the biggest and most important timber bridges in the state since it was originally built to take produce from the Riverina to Sydney; however he is not confident that the Hampden Bridge could be saved due to the amount of money needed to restore it to a good condition, which would cost the Council millions of dollars and involve high ongoing maintenance costs. By November 2007, Councillors attend a number of workshops on estimated costs of rehabilitation and demolition. The cost of rehabilitation was estimated to be 1.5 million and demolition 1.6 million. On 27 February 2008, the Wagga Wagga City Council approved A$300,000 to make the bridge structurally safe. During August 2008 a metal truss (used railway tracks to put it in place) is placed on the failed section of the Hampden Bridge, to raise the deck for repair. In March 2012 the Wagga Wagga City Council voted to dismantle the Hampden Bridge. A tender was awarded to Queensland-based company, Southern Cross Demolition, in February 2013 for the complete demolition of the bridge. In April 2014 the Council received planning approval for the demolition of the bridge except for the bridge's pylons, and demolition of the bridge commenced in June 2014. By 20 August 2014 the controlled demolition of the bridge skeleton, using the induced collapse method, was completed.

The term itself is a play on the popular corporate phrase \\"cradle to grave\\", implying that the C2C model is sustainable and considerate of life and future generations‚Äîfrom the birth, or \\"cradle\\", of one generation to the next generation, versus from birth to death, or \\"grave\\", within the same generation. C2C suggests that industry must protect and enrich ecosystems and nature's biological metabolism while also maintaining a safe, productive technical metabolism for the high-quality use and circulation of organic and technical nutrients. It is a holistic, economic, industrial and social framework that seeks to create systems that are not only efficient but also essentially waste free.Lovins, L. Hunter (2008). Rethinking production in State of the World 2008, pp. 38‚Äì40. Building off the whole systems approach of John T. Lyle's regenerative design, the model in its broadest sense is not limited to industrial design and manufacturing; it can be applied to many aspects of human civilization such as urban environments, buildings, economics and social systems. The term \\"Cradle to Cradle\\" is a registered trademark of McDonough Braungart Design Chemistry (MBDC) consultants. The Cradle to Cradle Certified Products Program began as a proprietary system; however, in 2012 MBDC turned the certification over to an independent non-profit called the Cradle to Cradle Products Innovation Institute. Independence, openness, and transparency are the Institute's first objectives for the certification protocols. The phrase \\"cradle to cradle\\" itself was coined by Walter R. Stahel in the 1970s. The current model is based on a system of \\"lifecycle development\\" initiated by Michael Braungart and colleagues at the Environmental Protection Encouragement Agency (EPEA) in the 1990s and explored through the publication A Technical Framework for Life-Cycle Assessment. In 2002, Braungart and William McDonough published a book called Cradle to Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things, a manifesto for cradle-to-cradle design that gives specific details of how to achieve the model. The model has been implemented by a number of companies, organizations and governments around the world, predominantly in the European Union, China and the United States. Cradle-to-cradle design has also been the subject of many documentary films such as Waste = Food. Introduction Biological and technical cycles In the cradle-to-cradle model, all materials used in industrial or commercial processes‚Äîsuch as metals, fibers, dyes‚Äîfall into one of two categories: \\"technical\\" or \\"biological\\" nutrients. # Technical nutrients are strictly limited to non-toxic, non-harmful synthetic materials that have no negative effects on the natural environment; they can be used in continuous cycles as the same product without losing their integrity or quality. In this manner these materials can be used over and over again instead of being \\"downcycled\\" into lesser products, ultimately becoming waste. # Biological nutrients are organic materials that, once used, can be disposed of in any natural environment and decompose into the soil, providing food for small life forms without affecting the natural environment. This is dependent on the ecology of the region; for example, organic material from one country or landmass may be harmful to the ecology of another country or landmass. The two types of materials each follow their own cycle in the regenerative economy envisioned by Keunen and Huizing. =Structure= Initially defined by McDonough and Braungart, the Cradle to Cradle Products Innovation Institute's five certification criteria are: *Material health, which involves identifying the chemical composition of the materials that make up the product. Particularly hazardous materials (e.g. heavy metals, pigments, halogen compounds etc.) have to be reported whatever the concentration, and other materials reported where they exceed 100 ppm. For wood, the forest source is required. The risk for each material is assessed against criteria and eventually ranked on a scale with green being materials of low risk, yellow being those with moderate risk but are acceptable to continue to use, red for materials that have high risk and need to be phased out, and grey for materials with incomplete data. The method uses the term 'risk' in the sense of hazard (as opposed to consequence and likelihood). *Material reutilization, which is about recovery and recycling at the end of product life. *Assessment of energy required for production, which for the highest level of certification needs to be based on at least 50% renewable energy for all parts and subassemblies. *Water, particularly usage and discharge quality. *Social responsibility, which assesses fair labor practices. The certification is available at several levels: basic, silver, gold, platinum, with more stringent requirements at each. Prior to 2012, MBDC controlled the certification protocol. =Health= Currently, many human beings come into contact or consume, directly or indirectly, many harmful materials and chemicals daily. In addition, countless other forms of plant and animal life are also exposed. C2C seeks to remove dangerous technical nutrients (synthetic materials such as mutagenic materials, heavy metals and other dangerous chemicals) from current life cycles. If the materials we come into contact with and are exposed to on a daily basis are not toxic and do not have long term health effects, then the health of the overall system can be better maintained. For example, a fabric factory can eliminate all harmful technical nutrients by carefully reconsidering what chemicals they use in their dyes to achieve the colours they need and attempt to do so with fewer base chemicals. =Economics= The C2C model shows high potential for reducing the financial cost of industrial systems. For example, in the redesign of the Ford River Rouge Complex, the planting of Sedum (stonecrop) vegetation on assembly plant roofs retains and cleanses rain water. It also moderates the internal temperature of the building in order to save energy. The roof is part of an $18 million rainwater treatment system designed to clean of rainwater annually. This saved Ford $30 million that would otherwise have been spent on mechanical treatment facilities. Following C2C design principles, product manufacture can be designed to cost less for the producer and consumer. Theoretically, they can eliminate the need for waste disposal such as landfills. =Definitions= *Cradle to cradle is a play on the phrase \\"cradle to grave\\", implying that the C2C model is sustainable and considerate of life and future generations. *Technical nutrients are basically inorganic or synthetic materials manufactured by humans‚Äîsuch as plastics and metals‚Äîthat can be used many times over without any loss in quality, staying in a continuous cycle. *Biological nutrients and materials are organic materials that can decompose into the natural environment, soil, water, etc. without affecting it in a negative way, providing food for bacteria and microbiological life. *Materials are usually referred to as the building blocks of other materials, such as the dyes used in colouring fibers or rubbers used in the sole of a shoe. *Downcycling is the reuse of materials into lesser products. For example, a plastic computer case could be downcycled into a plastic cup, which then becomes a park bench, etc.; this eventually leads to plastic waste. In conventional understanding, this is no different from recycling that produces a supply of the same product or material. *Waste = Food is a basic concept of organic waste materials becoming food for bugs, insects and other small forms of life who can feed on it, decompose it and return it to the natural environment which we then indirectly use for food ourselves. =Existing synthetic materials= The question of how to deal with the countless existing technical nutrients (synthetic materials) that cannot be recycled or reintroduced to the natural environment is dealt with in C2C design. The materials that can be reused and retain their quality can be used within the technical nutrient cycles while other materials are far more difficult to deal with, such as plastics in the Pacific Ocean. Hypothetical examples One potential example is a shoe that is designed and mass-produced using the C2C model. The sole might be made of \\"biological nutrients\\" while the upper parts might be made of \\"technical nutrients\\". The shoe is mass-produced at a manufacturing plant that utilizes its waste material by putting it back into the cycle, potentially by using off-cuts from the rubber soles to make more soles instead of merely disposing of them; this is dependent on the technical materials not losing their quality as they are reused. Once the shoes have been manufactured, they are distributed to retail outlets where the customer buys the shoe at a reduced price because the customer is only paying for the use of the materials in the shoe for the period of time that they will be wearing them. When they outgrow the shoe or it is damaged, they return it to the manufacturer. When the manufacturer separates the sole from the upper parts (separating the technical and biological nutrients), the biological nutrients are returned to the natural environment while the technical nutrients can be used to create the sole of another shoe. Another example of C2C design is a disposable cup, bottle, or wrapper made entirely out of biological materials. When the user is finished with the item, it can be disposed of and returned to the natural environment; the cost of disposal of waste such as landfill and recycling is greatly reduced. The user could also potentially return the item for a refund so it can be used again. Finished products * Cradle-to-cradle shoe concepts have been made through the Nike Considered project. * Rohner Textile AG Climatex- textile * Biofoam, a cradle-to-cradle alternative to expanded polystyrene * Sewage sludge treatment plants are facilities that may create fertiliser from sewage sludge. This approach is green retrofit for the current (inefficient) system of organic waste disposal; as composting toilets are a better approach in the long run. * Aquion Energy large scale batteries * Ecovative Design packaging and insulation made from waste by binding it together with mycelium Implementation The C2C model can be applied to almost any system in modern society: urban environments, buildings, manufacturing, social systems. 5 steps are outlined in Cradle to Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things: #Get \\"free of\\" known culprits #Follow informed personal preferences #Create \\"passive positive\\" lists‚Äîlists of materials used categorised according to their safety level ##The X list‚Äîsubstances that must be phased out, such as teratogenic, mutagenic, carcinogenic. ##The gray list‚Äîproblematic substances that are not so urgently in need of phasing out ##The P list‚Äîthe \\"positive\\" list, substances actively defined as safe for use #Activate the positive list #Reinvent‚Äîthe redesign of the former system Products that adhere to all steps may be eligible to receive C2C certification. Other certifications such as Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) and Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM) can be used to qualify for certification, and vice versa in the case of BREEAM. C2C principles were first applied to systems in the early 1990s by Braungart's Hamburger Umweltinstitut (HUI) and The Environmental Institute in Brazil for biomass nutrient recycling of effluent to produce agricultural products and clean water as a byproduct. In 2005, IE Business School in Madrid launched the Center for Eco-Intelligent Innovation in collaboration with William McDonough to study the implementation of cradle-to-cradle design approaches in pioneering businesses. The academic research of companies lead to the elaboration of the Biosphere Rules, a set of five principles derived from nature that guide the implementation of circular models in production. In 2007, MBDC and the EPEA formed a strategic partnership with global materials consultancy Material ConneXion to help promote and disseminate C2C design principles by providing greater global access to C2C material information, certification and product development. As of January 2008, Material ConneXion's Materials Libraries in New York, Milan, Cologne, Bangkok and Daegu, Korea started to feature C2C assessed and certified materials and, in collaboration with MBDC and EPEA, the company now offers C2C Certification, and C2C product development. While the C2C model has influenced the construction or redevelopment of smaller sites, several large organizations and governments have also implemented the C2C model and its ideas and concepts: =Major implementations= * The Lyle Center for Regenerative Studies incorporates holistic & cyclic systems throughout the center. Regenerative design is arguably the foundation for the trademarked C2C. * The Government of China contributed to the construction of the city of Huangbaiyu based on C2C principles, utilising the rooftops for agriculture. This project is largely criticized as a failure to meet the desires & constraints of the local people.Article from The Age, August 2006 * The Ford River Rouge Complex redevelopment, cleaning of rainwater annually. * The Netherlands Institute of Ecology (NIOO-KNAW) planned to make its laboratory and office complex completely cradle-to-cradle compliant. * Several private houses and communal buildings in the Netherlands * Fashion Positive, an initiative to assist the fashion world in implementing the cradle-to-cradle model in five areas: material health, material reuse, renewable energy, water stewardship and social fairness. Coordination with other models The cradle-to-cradle model can be viewed as a framework that considers systems as a whole or holistically. It can be applied to many aspects of human society, and is related to life-cycle assessment. See for instance the LCA-based model of the eco-costs, which has been designed to cope with analyses of recycle systems.J.G. Vogtl√§nder, Ch. F. Hendriks, J.C. Brezet; Allocation in recycle systems: an integrated model for the analyses of environmental impact and economic value, Int. J. of LCA, Vol. 6 (6) , pp 344‚Äì355, The cradle-to-cradle model in some implementations is closely linked with the car-free movement, such as in the case of large-scale building projects or the construction or redevelopment of urban environments. It is closely linked with passive solar design in the building industry and with permaculture in agriculture within or near urban environments. An earthship is a perfect example where different re- use models are used, including cradle-to-cradle design and permaculture. Constraints A major constraint in the optimal recycling of materials is that at civic amenity sites, products are not disassembled by hand and have each individual part sorted into a bin, but instead have the entire product sorted into a certain bin. This makes the extraction of rare earth elements and other materials uneconomical (at recycling sites, products typically get crushed after which the materials are extracted by means of magnets, chemicals, special sorting methods, ...) and thus optimal recycling of, for example metals is impossible (an optimal recycling method for metals would require to sort all similar alloys together rather than mixing plain iron with alloys). Obviously, disassembling products is not feasible at currently designed civic amenity sites, and a better method would be to send back the broken products to the manufacturer, so that the manufacturer can disassemble the product. These disassembled product can then be used for making new products or at least to have the components sent separately to recycling sites (for proper recycling, by the exact type of material). At present though, few laws are put in place in any country to oblige manufacturers to take back their products for disassembly, nor are there even such obligations for manufacturers of cradle-to-cradle products. One process where this is happening is in the EU with the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive. Also, the European Training Network for the Design and Recycling of Rare-Earth Permanent Magnet Motors and Generators in Hybrid and Full Electric Vehicles (ETN-Demeter) makes designs of electric motors of which the magnets can be easily removed for recycling the rare earth metals.  Criticism and response Criticism has been advanced on the fact that McDonough and Braungart previously kept C2C consultancy and certification in their inner circle. Critics argued that this lack of competition prevented the model from fulfilling its potential. Many critics pleaded for a public-private partnership overseeing the C2C concept, thus enabling competition and growth of practical applications and services. McDonough and Braungart responded to this criticism by giving control of the certification protocol to a non- profit, independent Institute called the Cradle to Cradle Products Innovation Institute. McDonough said the new institute \\"will enable our protocol to become a public certification program and global standard\\". The new Institute announced the creation of a Certification Standards Board in June 2012. The new board, under the auspices of the Institute, will oversee the certification moving forward. Experts in the field of environment protection have questioned the practicability of the concept. Friedrich Schmidt-Bleek, head of the German Wuppertal Institute called his assertion, that the \\"old\\" environmental movement had hindered innovation with its pessimist approach \\"pseudo- psychological humbug\\". Schmidt-Bleek said of the Cradle-to-Cradle seat cushions Braungart developed for the Airbus 380: In 2009 Schmidt-Bleek stated that it is out of the question that the concept can be realized on a bigger scale. Some claim that C2C certification may not be entirely sufficient in all eco-design approaches. Quantitative methodologies (LCAs) and more adapted tools (regarding the product type which is considered) could be used in tandem. The C2C concept ignores the use phase of a product. According to variants of life-cycle assessment (see: ) the entire life cycle of a product or service has to be evaluated, not only the material itself. For many goods e.g. in transport, the use phase has the most influence on the environmental footprint. For example, the more lightweight a car or a plane the less fuel it consumes and consequently the less impact it has. Braungart fully ignores the use phase. It is safe to say that every production step or resource- transformation step needs a certain amount of energy. The C2C concept foresees its own certification of its analysis and therefore is in contradiction to international publishing standards (ISO 14040 and ISO 14044) for life-cycle assessment whereas an independent external review is needed in order to obtain comparative and resilient results.

Jorgensen (April 12, 1934 ‚Äì October 10, 1990) was an American football official in the National Football League (NFL) for 22 years, through the 1989 season, the last 19 years as a referee. Jorgensen's officiating career was highlighted by being selected to referee Super Bowl XXIV in January 1990. He was an alternate official for Super Bowl VIII in 1974 and Super Bowl XV in 1981. Early years Born and raised in Neenah, Wisconsin, southwest of Green Bay, Jorgensen was a three-sport athlete at Neenah High School, where he starred in football and tennis. His primary sport was basketball, played under longtime head coach Ole Jorgensen (1904‚Äì1988), his father. His mother Edith also worked at the school, as a physical education teacher. In Jorgensen's senior year in 1952, Neenah advanced to the state semifinals in basketball. and he was selected for the all-state team. A shooting guard, Jorgensen played college basketball in the Big Ten Conference at the University of Wisconsin in Madison under hall of fame head coach Bud Foster. He was captain of the Badgers his senior year in 1956, graduated and served two years in the U.S. Navy, and married Adlon Dohme in 1959. NFL official After five seasons officiating high school and small college football, Jorgensen began his NFL career in 1968 as a line judge. He was promoted to referee three years later in 1971 when his crew chief from 1970, George Rennix, retired. In the NFL, Jorgensen was assigned to 12 post-season games, including four conference championship games and Super Bowl XXIV. On the field, Jorgensen wore uniform number 60 for the majority of his career (he wore number 6 from 1979‚Äì81, when officials were numbered separately by position). Known for his poise as a referee in the 1970s and 1980s, one incident summarized his presence and is often replayed in highlights. While approaching a fourth quarter scuffle during a nationally televised Monday night game in November 1983, Jorgensen was inadvertently struck in the mouth by a reserve offensive lineman's flying elbow. The blow caused a cut which required a stitch, but the unflappable Jorgensen calmly proceeded, called a penalty and ejected the player. Bank president Off the field, Jorgensen served as President of Marine Bank of Champaign-Urbana, Illinois. Active in the community as a civic leader, he was also president of the local chapter of the United Way, the chamber of commerce, and his country club. Death Super Bowl XXIV in January 1990 was Jorgensen's final game as a game official; that May, he was diagnosed with a rare blood disorder. He died five months later at age 56 on October 10 in Urbana, Illinois. For the remainder of the 1990 season, NFL officials wore a black armband on their left sleeve with the white number 60 to honor Jorgensen. He and his wife Adlon had three daughters. Jorgensen was buried at Bailey Memorial Cemetery in Tolono.

It was recorded by Bob Weston and released on Touch and Go Records in 1997. Reception Tom Schulte of Allmusic called it \\"a fascinating record that takes great liberties with rock- n-roll\\", noting its combination of \\"fuzzed-out blasts ala Blue Cheer with quasi-psychedelic twanging and droning.\\" He ends his review by \\"predicting\\" as \\"a safe bet\\" that the band \\"will be looked on as one of the better bands of the 90s\\". The A.V.

The review ends by writing that \\"Polvo's genius shows through by achieving the difficult harmony between the structured and the chaotic.\\" Pearson Greer of Opus called the band polarizing, writing that there's \\"tons of odd time signatures, skronky guitar and bass tones, synth squiggles, solos, and other esoterica that‚Äôs straight from prog rock\\" on the album.

These conquests were started by Shivaji in 1659 from the victory at the Battle of Pratapgad against Bijapur. The expansion of the empire was limited and interrupted by the Mughal conquests of south India by Emperor Aurangzeb. Marathas were forced to defend their territories against the overwhelmingly strong Mughal army in the 27 years long Deccan wars. They were able to defend their territories and gain an upper hand over Mughals in the sustained conflict. Afterwards, the Marathas conclusively defeated and overtook major territories of the Mughal Empire in the Indian subcontinent and its vassals. It ended with the eventual fall of the Maratha Empire after the Anglo-Maratha Wars. Background After a lifetime of warfare with Adilshah of Bijapur and Mughal emperor Aurangzeb, Shivaji founded an independent Maratha kingdom in 1674 with Raigad as its capital. Shivaji died in 1680. After Shivaji, Sambhaji took up throne. He built strong army as well as navy. Mughal emperor Aurangzeb shifted his capital from Delhi to Aurangabad to defeat Sambhaji. The Mughals invaded, fighting an War of 27 years from 1681 to 1707 in which the Marathas under Tarabai were victorious. Sambhaji was captured during this war and killed by Mughals. Shahu, a grandson of Shivaji, ruled as emperor until 1749. During his reign, Shahu appointed the first Peshwa as head of the government, under certain conditions. After the death of Shahu, the Peshwas became the de facto leaders of the Empire from 1749 to 1761, while Shivaji's successors continued as nominal rulers from their base in Satara. Covering a major part of the subcontinent, the Maratha Empire kept the British forces at bay during the 18th century, until internal relations between the Peshwas and their sardars (army commanders) deteriorated, provoking its gradual downfall. The Maratha Empire was at its height in the 18th century under Shahu and the Peshwa Baji Rao I. Losses at the Third Battle of Panipat in 1761 suspended further expansion of the empire in the North-west and reduced the power of the Peshwas. In 1761, after severe losses in the Panipat war, the Peshwas slowly started losing the control of the kingdom. Many military chiefs of the Maratha Empire like Shinde, Holkar, Gaikwad, PantPratinidhi, Bhosale of Nagpur, Dev (Gade) of Wardha, Pandit of Bhor, Patwardhan, and Newalkar started to work towards their ambition of becoming kings in their respective regions. However, under Madhavrao Peshwa, Maratha authority in North India was restored, 10 years after the battle of Panipat. After the death of Madhavrao, the empire gave way to a loose Confederacy, with political power resting in a 'pentarchy' of five mostly Maratha dynasties: the Peshwas of Pune; the Sindhias (originally \\"Shindes\\") of Malwa and Gwalior; the Holkars of Indore; the Bhonsles of Nagpur; and the Gaekwads of Baroda. A rivalry between the Sindhia and Holkar dominated the confederation's affairs into the early 19th century, as did the clashes with the British and the British East India Company in the three Anglo-Maratha Wars. In the Third Anglo-Maratha War, the last Peshwa, Baji Rao II, was defeated by the British in 1818 and the empire ceased to exist. Battles under Shivaji = Battle of Umberkhind = Battle of Umberkhind ( Marathi: ‡§â‡§Ç‡§¨‡§∞‡§ñ‡§ø‡§Ç‡§°‡•Ä‡§ö‡•Ä ‡§≤‡§¢‡§æ‡§à ) took place on 3 February 1661 in the mountain range of Sahyadri near the city of Pen, Maharashtra, India. The battle was fought between the Maratha under Chhatrapati Shivaji and General Kartalab Khan of the Mughal Empire. The Marathas decisively defeated the Mughal forces. This battle was a great example of guerrilla warfare. = Battle of Salher = The Battle of Salher which was a battle fought between the Maratha Empire and the Mughal Empire in February 1672 CE. The battle was fought near the fort of Salher in the Nashik district. The result was a decisive victory for the Maratha Empire. This battle is considered particularly significant as it is the first battle in which the Mughal Empire lost on an open field. Mughal empire started to decline after this battle and the battle of Dindori fought one year earlier. =Battle of Vikramgad= Battle of Vikramgad was a land battle that took place in the year 1672 near Vikramgad, Palghar district, Maharashtra between the Maratha Empire and the Mughal Empire. The Marathas were led by prince Sambhaji and Moropant and the Mughals were led by Khijr Khan. The Marathas won a decisive victory and it consolidated their territorial gains in Kolwan. =Battle of Kalyan= The Battle of Kalyan occurred between the Mughal Empire and Maratha Empire between 1682 and 1683. General Bahadur Khan of the Mughal Empire defeated the Maratha army and took over Kalyan fort. The Marathas attempted a counter offensive, but failed and they were repulsed and their army was destroyed by Mughal forces. =Battle of Bhupalgarh= The Battle of Bhupalgarh occurred between the Mughal and Maratha empires in 1679. The battle resulted in the defeat of the Marathas and capture, loot and razing of the fort of Bhupalgarh under Firangoji Narsala by the Mughal forces led by Diler Khan. =Battle of Sangamner= The Battle of Sangamner was fought between the Mughal Empire and Maratha Empire in 1679. This was the last battle in which the Maratha King Shivaji fought. The Mughals had ambushed Shivaji when he was returning from a sack on Jalna. The Marathas engaged in battle with the Mughals for three days until Maratha General, Sidhoji Nimbalkar was killed alongside 2,000 Maratha soldiers. The Maratha force was largely decimated defending their king, however Shivaji managed to retreat with 500 men. Battles after Shivaji =War of 27 Years = War of 27 years was a series of battles fought between Marathas and Mughals from 1681 to 1707 in the Indian subcontinent. It was a series of battles. The war started in 1680 with the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb‚Äôs invasion of the Maratha enclave in Bijapur established by Shivaji.Medieval India The war can be broken down into three distinct phases : *Marathas under Sambhaji (1681‚Äì1689). *Marathas under Rajaram (1689‚Äì1699). *Marathas under Tarabai (1699‚Äì1707). It was a long snakes and ladders war game involving a quarter of a century and innumerable long and short battles. The war ended with the ultimate defeat and death of Aurangzeb in 1707. It also paved the way for the Maratha expansion in the North.Northan expansion upto Peshawar  Battles under Sambhaji  Shivaji was succeeded by his son Sambhaji after his death in April 1680. His son Sambhaji was also a genius military commander like him. Sambhaji fought many victorious battles in his short life. Sambhaji managed to defend the Maratha Empire against the overwhelmingly strong Mughal Empire. Sambhaji fought many battles in his reign against his enemies such as Mughal Empire, Siddis of Janjira, Portuguese of Goa and North Konkan, Chikkadevaraya of Mysore. =Siege of Ramsej= Siege of Ramsej (1682-1688) was a sustained military conflict between Maratha Empire led by Sambhaji and Mughal Empire led by Aurangzeb for the control of Ramsej fort in Nashik district of Maharashtra. The 600 Marathas under Killedar Suryaji Jedhe were able defend the fort against the overwhelmingly strong Mughal army for six years. After 5 years Suryaji Jedhe was transferred to another fort according to the rotation policy of the Maratha Administration. Mughals bribed the new Killedar and captured the fort in 1688. The heroic defence of Ramsej by a handful of Marathas became a symbol of Maratha resistance against Aurangzeb.  Battles after 1707  =Battle of Palkhed= Battle of Palkhed was a land battle that took place on 28 February 1728 at the village of Palkhed, near the city of Nashik, Maharashtra, India between the Maratha Peshwa, Baji Rao I and the Nizam-ul-Mulk of Hyderabad. The Marathas defeated the Nizam. The battle is considered an example of brilliant execution of military strategy.The Concise History of Warfare, Field Marshal Bernard Law Montgomery, p.132 Engraving of a Maratha Soldier by James Forbes 1813. =Battle of Mandsaur= The Battle of Mandsaur took place in Mandsaur, modern day Madhya Pradesh between Marathas, commanded by Malharrao Holkar, and Jai Singh of Amber, in which Jai Singh was defeated in February, 1733. Malhar Rao Holkar then conquered Bundelkhand and Bundi.P. K. Sethi, S. K. Bhatt, R. Holkar., A study of Holkar state coinage, page 32 =Battle of Delhi= In November of 1736, the Maratha Peshwa Baji Rao I advanced on Old Delhi to attack the Mughal capital. Mughal emperor Muhammad Shah sent Saadat Ali Khan I with a 150,000-strong army to stop the Maratha advance on Delhi. But Baji Rao's subordinate chiefs Malhar Rao Holkar and Pilaji Jadhav crossed the river Yamuna and looted Ganga-Yamuna Doab. Saadat Khan then retired to Mathura, thinking the Marathas had retreated towards Pune. But Baji Rao's army advanced to Delhi and encamped near Talkatora. Muhammad Shah sent Mir Hasan Khan Koka with an army to intercept Baji Rao. The Mughals were devastated by the fierce Maratha attack, and lost half of their army, which compelled them to ask for all regional rulers to help against the army of the Marathas. After the battle, when the news of Saadat Ali Khan's approaching large Mughal army reached Baji Rao, he retreated to Pune. =Battle of Bhopal= The Battle was fought between the Maratha Empire and Mughal forces led by Nizam of Hyderabad near Bhopal in India in December 1737. The Marathas poisoned the water and the replenishment supplies of the besieged Mughal forces. Chimaji was sent with an army of 10,000 men to stop any reinforcements while Bajirao blockaded the city instead of directly attacking the Nizam. The Nizam was forced to sue for peace after he was denied reinforcements from Delhi.Advance Study in the History of Modern India (Volume-1: 1707-1803) Pg.26 The battle resulted in decisive Maratha victory mainly through the swift tactics of Maratha Peshwa Baji Rao. =Battle of Vasai= The Battle of Vasai was fought between the Marathas and the Portuguese rulers of Vasai, a village lying near Bombay in the present-day state of Maharashtra, India. The Marathas were led by Chimaji Appa, a brother of Peshwa Baji Rao I. Maratha victory in this war was a major achievement of Baji Rao I reign. Maratha invasions of Bengal =First Battle of Katwa= The Battle of Katwa occurred between the Nawab of Bengal and Maratha Empire in 1742. The Maratha's initially attacked and captured Katwa and Hooghly, in Bengal. The Nawab of Bengal Ali Vardi Khan responded with a direct attack at the Maratha camp at Katwa in the nightfall, so much that the entire Maratha army evacuated out of Bengal on September 17, 1742 believing a much larger force had charged them. =Second Battle of Katwa= The Second Battle of Katwa occurred between the Nawab of Bengal and Maratha Empire in 1745. After the initial evacuation of the Maratha's at the First Battle of Katwa, the Maratha General, Raghuji Bhonsle attempted, once again, to conquer Katwa. Bhonsle, with 20,000 horsemen attacked Murshidabad then moved onwards to Katwa, where Nawab of Bengal Ali Vardi Khan fought Raghuji and his men, with Marathas moving in towards Medinipur in Bengal. =Battle of Burdwan= The Battle of Burdwan occurred between the Nawab of Bengal and Maratha empires in 1747. After the dismissal of Mir Jafar by Ali Vardi Khan, an army was amassed to defend against the invading Maratha forces of Janoji Bhonsle at Orissa. Ali Vardi Khan managed to heavily repulse and defeat the Maratha's in this battle. =Battle of Delhi, 1757= After a victorious Battle of Narela on 16 January 1757 Maratha Army led by Antaji Mankeshwar and an advance column of Ahmad Shah Abdali's army, the Battle of Delhi was a battle fought on 11 August 1757 between Maratha Empire under the command of Sadashivbhau rao and Rohilla Afghans under Najib-ud-Daula. The battle was waged by the Marathas for the control of Delhi, the former Mughal capital which was now under the control of Rohilla chief Najib-ud-Daula, as a consequence of fourth invasion of Ahmad Shah Abdali.  Maratha conquest of Northwest India  Malharrao Holkar, Raghunathrao, Shamsher Bahadur, Gangadhar Tatya, Sakharambapu, Naroshankar and Maujiram Bania attacked Delhi on 11 August 1757 and defeated Najib Khan and Ahmed Khan became the Mir Bakshi in his place. In March, 1758, they conquered Sarhind. On 20 April 1758, Malharrao Holkar and Raghunathrao attacked and conquered Lahore. Tukojirao Holkar conquered Attock and Peshawar. In Lahore, as in Delhi, the Marathas were now major players. The Maratha Empire had reached its peak, the empire's territories covered almost half of South Asia. This was followed by the third battle of Panipat. Losses at the Third Battle of Panipat in 1761 suspended further expansion of the empire in the North-west of India and reduced the power of the Peshwas. =Third Battle of Panipat= Maratha Light Horseman The Third Battle of Panipat took place on 14 January 1761 at Panipat (Haryana State, India), about 60 miles (95.5 km) north of Delhi. The battle pitted the French-supplied artillery of the Marathas against the heavy cavalry of the Afghans led by Ahmad Shah Durrani, an ethnic Pashtun, also known as Ahmad Shah Abdali. The battle is considered one of the largest battles fought in the 18th century. The famished, burdened and outnumbered Marathas were defeated with heavy casualties. There were near 100,000 soldiers dead adding both sides and the battle resulted in retreat of Maratha army and civilians from Punjab to Delhi. Maratha Resurrection =Restoration of Maratha suzerainty in the North= Under Madhavrao Peshwa, Maratha authority in North India (including Delhi) was restored ten years after the battle of Panipat. The Rohillas were defeated and were forced to pay a heavy war indemnity. Delhi was captured by Mahadji Scindia in late 1770 and restored Mughal emperor Shah Alam II to the throne of Delhi in 1772. =Battle of Alegaon= The Battle of Alegaon was fought between Nizam Ali Khan of Hyderabad and Raghunathrao of the Maratha Empire against Peshwa Madhavrao of the Maratha Empire. Raghunathrao had established an alliance with Nizam Ali Khan of Hyderabad. When conflict arose between Raghunathrao and Madhavrao I, a joint campaign between Nizam Ali Khan and Raghunathrao resulted in Madhavrao I being heavily defeated. Peshwa Madhavrao surrendered on November 12, 1762. Nizam Ali Khan got all of his previously lost territories that were lost at the Battle of Udgir. Peshwa Madhavrao submitted to his uncle, Raghunathrao. =Battle of Rakshasbhuvan= The Battle of Rakshasbhuvan was fought on 10 August 1763. While the Marathas were fighting amongst themselves during a civil war, the Nizam decided to attack. The Nizam however failed. The Nizam gave up territory he gained during the Battle of Alegaon in an attempt to sue for peace. =Capture of Delhi, 1771= The forces of Mahadji Shinde captured Delhi in 1771 and the Mughal Emperor Shah Alam II was restored to the throne. Marathas capture Delhi by defeating Afghans under Najib khan. With this battle they regained their lost supremacy in North India after the Third Battle of Panipat and conquered much of the lost territories which they lost after the Third Battle of Panipat. =Marathas in Rohilkhand= After taking control of Delhi, Marathas sent a large army in 1772 to \\"punish\\" Afghan Rohillas for Panipat. Maratha army devastated Rohilkhand by looting and plundering and also took the members of royal family as captives. Maratha general Mahadaji was ‚Äúvery much pleased with the revenge taken by his men‚Äù for PanipatThe Great Maratha Mahadaji Scindia p.9 Conflict with the Kingdom of Mysore =Battle of Rutehalli Fort= In 1764, following the attack by Hyder Ali on Nawabs of Savanur, who were a tributary to the Marathas, Maratha army led by Peshwa Madhav Rao met the forces of Hyder Ali at Rutehalli Fort.

Tipu strategically lured the Marathas out of their position on a height near Savanur and unleashed a barrage of heavy fire on them. This devastated the Maratha army, making them retreat and Tipu Sultan conquered Savanur soon after. =Siege of Bahadur Benda= The Siege of Bahadur Benda happened between the forces of Tipu Sultan of Mysore and the Maratha forces of Haripant. Tipu Sultan defeated the Maratha forces. Following this battle, a peace agreement was signed between the [Empire of Mysore] and the Maratha Empire, which allowed for Tipu Sultan to focus his resources into combating the British Empire. =Battle of Gajendragad= The Battle of Gajendragad was fought in June 1786, during the Maratha-Mysore War. An army of the Maratha Empire led by Tukoji Rao Holkar, defeated the army of Tipu Sultan and captured the town and fortress at Gajendragad. Mysore was obligated to pay 4.8 million rupees as a war cost to the Marathas, and an annual tribute of 1.2 million rupees. The treaty of Gajendragad signed after the battle ended the Maratha- Mysore conflict. First Anglo Maratha War (1775 - 1783) = Battle of Wadgaon = The East India Company's force from Bombay consisted of about 3,900 men (about 600 Europeans, the rest Asian) accompanied by many thousands of servants and specialist workers. They were joined on the way by Raghunath's forces, adding several thousand more soldiers, and more artillery. The Maratha army included forces contributed by all the partners in the federation, tens of thousands in all, commanded by Tukojirao Holkar and General Mahadji Shinde (also known as Mahadji Sindia). Mahadji slowed down the British march and sent forces west to cut off its supply lines. When they found out about this, the British halted at Talegaon, a few hours' brisk march from Pune, but days away for the thousands of support staff with their ox-drawn carts. Now the Maratha cavalry harassed the enemy from all sides. The Marathas also utilized a scorched earth policy, burning farmland and poisoning wells. The British began to withdraw from Talegaon in the middle of the night, but the Marathas attacked, forcing them to halt in the village of Wadgaon (now called Vadgaon or Vadgaon Maval), where the British force was surrounded on 12 January 1779. By the end of the next day, the British were ready to discuss surrender terms, and on 16 January signed the Treaty of Wadgaon that forced the Bombay government to relinquish all territories acquired by the Bombay office of the East India Company since 1773.Beveridge, Henry A Comprehensive History of India, London, Blackie (1862), via Google Books, accessed 2008-01-27 =Battle of Patan= The Battle of Patan was fought on June 20, 1790 between the Maratha Empire and the Rajputs of Jaipur and their Mughal allies. Many Rajput kingdoms like those of Jaipur and Malwa were threatened by the Marathas. In early 1790, hoping to completely rid the Rajputana off Maratha interference, Rajput nobility allied with Mughal general Ismail Beg. Marathas crushed the allied Rajput-Mughal army. The European armed and trained battalion of De Boigne defeated the Jaipur army at battle of Patan. Marathas managed to conquer Ajmer and Malwa from Rajputs. Marathas recovered over 105 pieces of artillery from the enemy, along with 21 elephants, 1300 camels and 300 horses. Rajputs lost over 5 battalions and 3000 Rathore horsemen. =Battle of Merta, 1790= The forces of Mahadji Shinde under de Boigne routed the Marwar army. =Capture of Ajmer, 1790= The forces of Mahadji Shinde captured Ajmer. =Capture of Shimoga= The Capture of Shimoga, a town and fortress held by forces of the Kingdom of Mysore, occurred on 3 January 1792 after a preliminary battle with the attacking forces of the British East India Company and the Marathas not far from the town on 29 December had scattered much of its defending army. The defenders surrendered after the fort's walls were breached. The battle was part of a campaign during the Third Anglo-Mysore War by Maratha leader Purseram Bhow to recover Maratha territories taken by Hyder Ali in an earlier conflict between Mysore and the Marathas. By the end of the siege Reza Sahib a leading Mysore commander was among the captured. =Battle of Kharda= The Battle of Kharda took place in February 1795 between the Nizam of Hyderabad, Asaf Jah II and Peshwa Madhavrao II, in which Nizam was badly defeated. Governor General John Shore followed the policy of non- intervention despite that Nizam was under his protection. So this led to the loss of trust with British and rout of the Hyderabad army. This was the last battle fought together by all Maratha warlords. =Battle of Malpura= Daulat Rao Sindhia defeated Sawai Pratap Singh of Jaipur. But pyrrhic maratha victory. Second Anglo Maratha War (1803 - 1805) =Battle of Delhi, 1803= The Battle of Delhi took place on 11 September 1803 during the Second Anglo-Maratha War, between British troops under General Lake, and Marathas of Scindia's army under French General Louis Bourquin. The battle was fought at Patparganj, right across Yamuna River from Humayun's Tomb, also giving the battle its local name. The Marathas occupied a strong position with the Jumna in their rear, and Lake, feigning a retreat, drew them from their lines, and then turning upon them drove them with the bayonet into the river, inflicting more losses upon them. The city of Delhi surrendered three days later. A monument was later erected at the site in Patparganj, marked out by a surrounding ditch, commemorating Cornet Sanguine and British soldiers who fell during the battle. =Battle of Bharatpur= Yashwantrao Holkar defeated the British army, led by Colonel Fawcett, at Kunch, in Bundelkhand. On 8 June 1804, the Governor General, in a letter to Lord Lake, wrote that the defeat caused a great insult to the British prestige in India. On 8 July 1804, Yashwantrao Holkar defeated the army of Colonel Manson and Leukan at Mukundare and Kota. Bapuji Scindia surrendered before Holkar. From June till September 1804, he defeated the British at different battles. On 8 October 1804, Holkar attacked Delhi to free Mughal Emperor Shah Alam II, who was imprisoned by the British. He attacked the army of Colonel Actorloni and Berne. The battle lasted for a week, but Yashwantrao Holkar could not succeed as Lord Lake came to help Colonel Actorloni. On 16 November 1804, Yashwantrao Holkar reached Deeg by defeating the army of Major Frazer. After the death of Major Frazer, Manson took the charge of the British army. In Farrukhabad, Lord Lake was a mute spectator, watching Holkar proceeding towards Deeg; he didn't attack Holkar. Lord Lake attacked Deeg on 13 December 1804 (see- Battle of Bharatpur); the army of Holkar and Jat resisted successfully and reached the Bharatpur Durg. Lord Lake attacked Bharatpur on 3 January 1805, along with General Manson, Colonel Marey, Colonel Don, Colonel Berne, Major General Jones, General Smith, Colonel Jetland, Setan, and others. However, Holkar had to leave Bharatpur as the Jat King Ranjit Singh of Bharatpur defeated the British army on 17 April 1805. Covering a large part of the subcontinent, the Maratha Empire kept the British forces at bay during the 18th century, until dissension between the Peshwas and their sardars (army commanders) saw a gradual downfall of the empire with the eventual defeat in the third Anglo- Maratha war the First Anglo-Maratha War ended in a stalemate with both sides signing the treaty of Salbai. This led to a period of relative peace between the two powers till the decisive second Anglo-Maratha war took place. Third Anglo-Maratha War The Third Anglo-Maratha War (1817‚Äì1818) was the final and decisive conflict between the British East India Company and the Maratha Empire in India. The war left the Company in control of most of India. It began with an invasion of Maratha territory by 110,400 British East India Company troops, the largest such British controlled force amassed in India. The troops were led by the Governor General Hastings and he was supported by a force under General Thomas Hislop. It resulted in the formal end of the Maratha empire and the firm establishment of the British East India Company in almost the entire Indian subcontinent.

In December 2009, the district administration reported that 493 pupils or 14.6% of the district's pupils received Special Education services, with 48.3% of the identified students having a specific learning disability. Special education services in the Commonwealth are provided to students from ages three years to 21 years old. In the 2010-2011 school year, the total student enrollment was more than 1.78 million students with approximately 275,000 students eligible for special education services. Among these students 18,959 were identified with mental retardation and 21,245 students with autism.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Testimony Hearing on Special Education Senate Republican Policy Committee, January 2013 The largest group of students are identified as Specific Learning Disabilities 126,026 students (46.9 percent) and Speech or Language Impairments with 43,542 students (16.2 percent). In order to comply with state and federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act rules and regulations, the school district engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress. To identify students who may be eligible for special education services, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Special Education administration. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the district seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the Cocalico District or contact the district's Special Education Department. The IDEA 2004 requires each school entity to publish a notice to parents, in newspapers or other media, including the student handbook and website regarding the availability of screening and intervention services and how to access them. In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for Special Education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. The Special Education funding structure is through the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) funds and state appropriations. IDEA funds are appropriated to the state on an annual basis and distributed through intermediate units (IUs) to school districts, while state funds are distributed directly to the districts. Total funds that are received by school districts are calculated through a formula. The Pennsylvania Department of Education oversees four appropriations used to fund students with special needs: Special Education; Approved Private Schools; Pennsylvania Chartered Schools for the Deaf and Blind; and Early Intervention. The Pennsylvania Special Education funding system assumes that 16% of the district's students receive special education services. It also assumes that each student's needs accrue the same level of costs.Browne, Patrick., Senate Education Committee Hearing on Special Education Funding & Accountability testimony, November 1, 2011 Over identification of students, in order to increase state funding, has been an issue in the Commonwealth. Some districts have more than 20% of its students receiving special education services while others have 10% supported through special education.Kintisch, Baruch., Public Hearing: Special Education Funding & Accountability Testimony, Education Law Center, November 11, 2011 The state requires each public school district and charter school to have a three-year special education plan to meet the unique needs of its special education students.Amy Morton, Executive Deputy Secretary, Public Hearing: Special Education Funding & Accountability Testimony, Pennsylvania Department of Education, November 11, 2011 In 2012, the Obama Administration's US Department of Education issued a directive requiring schools include students with disabilities in extracurricular activities, including sports.US Department of Education, U.S. Department of Education Clarifies Schools' Obligation to Provide Equal Opportunity to Students with Disabilities to Participate in Extracurricular Athletics, January 25, 2013 Cocalico School District received a $1,597,519 supplement for special education services in 2010. For the 2011‚Äì12, 2012‚Äì13 and 2013-14 school years, all Pennsylvania public school districts received the same level of funding for special education that they received in 2010-11. This level funding is provided regardless of changes in the number of pupils who need special education services and regardless of the level of services the respective students required. For the 2014-2015 school year, Cocalico School District will receive an increase to $1,637,390 from the Commonwealth for special education funding.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Special Education funding report by LEA, July 2014 Additionally, the state provides supplemental funding for extraordinarily impacted students. The district must apply for this added funding. =Gifted education= Cocalico District Administration reported that 43 or 1.29% of its students were gifted in 2009. The highest percentage of gifted students reported among all 500 school districts and 100 public charter schools in Pennsylvania was North Allegheny School District with 15.5% of its students identified as gifted. By law, the district must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student's building principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility. Budget Pennsylvania public school districts budget and expend funds according to procedures mandated by the General Assembly and the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE). An annual operating budget is prepared by school district administrative officials. A uniform form is furnished by the PDE and submitted to the board of school directors for approval prior to the beginning of each fiscal year on July 1. Under Pennsylvania's Taxpayer Relief Act, Act 1 of the Special Session of 2006, all school districts of the first class A, second class, third class and fourth class must adopt a preliminary budget proposal. The proposal must include estimated revenues and expenditures and the proposed tax rates. This proposed budget must be considered by the Board no later than 90 days prior to the date of the election immediately preceding the fiscal year. The preliminary budget proposal must also be printed and made available for public inspection at least 20 days prior to its adoption. The board of school directors may hold a public hearing on the budget, but are not required to do so. The board must give at least 10 days‚Äô public notice of its intent to adopt the final budget according to Act 1 of 2006.Pennsylvania General Assembly, Taxpayer Relief Act, Act 1 of the Special Session of 2006, June 27, 2006 In 2013, the average teacher salary in Cocalico School District was $62,771 a year, while the cost of the benefits teachers received was $23,013 per employee, for a total annual average teacher compensation of $85,785.

(Some teachers benefits utilize a 2.50% benefit factor.) After 40 years of service, a teacher can retire with 100% of the average salary of their final 3 years of employment. According to a study conducted at the American Enterprise Institute, in 2011, public school teachers‚Äô total compensation is roughly 50 percent higher than they would likely receive in the private sector. The study found that the most generous benefits that teachers receive are not accounted for in many studies of compensation including: pension, retiree health benefits and job security. In 2009, Cocalico School District reported employing 275 teachers and administrators with a median salary of $58,249 and a top salary of $128,850. The teacher's work day is 7.5 hours, with 188 days (181 student days) in the contract year. Teachers get a daily planning period and a 30-minute duty-free lunch. Additionally, the teachers receive a defined benefit pension, health insurance, life insurance, paid bereavement days off, professional development reimbursement, 3 paid personal days, 10 paid sick days, and other benefits. Upon retirement teachers also receive a bonus that is calculated based on years of service with bonuses exceeding $7000 each in 2009. ;Administration costs: Cocalico School District administrative costs per pupil in 2008 was $682.73 per pupil.

The undesignated funds are not committed to any planned project. Designated funds and any other funds, such as capital reserves, are allocated to specific projects. School districts are required by state law to keep 5 percent of their annual spending in the undesignated reserve funds to preserve bond ratings. According to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, from 2003 to 2010, as a whole, Pennsylvania school districts amassed nearly $3 billion in reserved funds.Murphy, Jan., Pennsylvania's public schools boost reserves, CentreDaily Times, September 22, 2010 In 2005, the total reserve funds held by Pennsylvania public school districts was $1.9 billion.

Tuition Students who live in the Cocalico School District's attendance area may choose to attend one of Pennsylvania's 157 public charter schools. A student living in a neighboring public school district or a foreign exchange student may seek admission to Cocalico School District. For these cases, the Pennsylvania Department of Education sets an annual tuition rate for each school district. It is the amount the public school district pays to a charter school for each resident student that attends the charter and it is the amount a nonresident student's parents must pay to attend the district's schools. The 2012 tuition rates are Elementary School - $8,728.80, High School - $10,988.27. Cocalico School District is funded by a combination of: a local earned income tax 0.5%, a property tax, a real estate transfer tax 0.5%, coupled with substantial funding from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and a small amount, generally 10% of its budget from the federal government. Grants can provide an opportunity to supplement school funding without raising local taxes. Interest earnings on accounts also provide nontax income to the district. In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, pension income and Social Security income are exempted from state personal income tax and local earned income tax, regardless of the level of the individual's personal wealth. The average Pennsylvania public school teacher pension in 2011 exceeds $60,000 a year plus they receive federal Social Security benefits: both are free of Pennsylvania state income tax and local income tax which funds local public schools. =State basic education funding= According to a report from Representative Todd Stephens office, Cocalico School District receives 27.8% of its annual revenue from the state.

The district used the funding to provide Full Day kindergarten, teacher coaches to improve their instruction in reading and math and teacher training.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Accountability Block Grant report Grantee list 2010, October 2010 In 2009, 100% of the kindergarteners in Area School District attended full-day kindergarten.Pennsylvania Partnership for Children, Full-Day Kindergarten Enrollment, 2011 Ready to Learn grant Beginning in the 2014-2015 budget, the State funded a new Ready to Learn Grant for public schools. A total of $100 million is allocated through a formula to districts based on the number of students, level of poverty of community as calculated by its market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) and the number of English language learners. Ready to Learn Block Grant funds may be used by the districts for: school safety; Ready by 3 early childhood intervention programs; individualized learning programs; and science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) programs. Cocalico School District will receive $227,314 in Ready to Learn Grant dollars in addition to State Basic Education funding, Special Education funding, Accountability Block Grant funding, PreK Counts funding, reimbursement for Social Security payments for employees and other state grants which the district must apply to receive. PreK Counts grant Cocalico School District receives state funding to provide taxpayer-funded preschool at the elementary schools. For the 2013-14 school year, Cocalico SD received a Pre K Counts grant of $117,300.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Pennsylvania 2013-14 Pre-K Counts Grantees 2013-13, August 2013 For the 2011 school year, School District was a high priority for funding due to the 48% poverty level of children in the district's attendance area.Pennsylvania Department of Education Early Childhood Advisor, Poverty Level by School District, 2007 Enrollment for Pennsylvania Pre-K Counts is targeted to children living in families earning up to 300 percent of the federal poverty level. In 2013, the state's PreK Counts program received $87,284,000. In 2010, the PreK Counts program received $83.6 million statewide in Governor Corbett's education budget. In 2007-08 the state funded Pre-K Counts at $75 million. School District received funding in 2007-08. For 2009-10, the district received $118,500 to provide preschool to 30 children. The district received $118,500 enrolling 31 students in preschool for 2011-2012 In addition to PreK Counts, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania also supplements the federal Head Start preschool program with an additional funding on an annual basis. The program is available to low income children residing within the district through private providers. In 2013, Pennsylvania contributed $39,178,000 to Head Start. In 2010, Head Start received $37.6 million in Pennsylvania state education dollars. Since 2003, Pennsylvania has more than doubled the number of preschoolers in publicly funded pre- kindergarten through a multipronged system including: school-based pre- kindergarten, Pennsylvania Pre-K Counts through private providers, Early Intervention, Head Start and Head Start Supplemental, and the school district's use of Accountability Block Grants. Over 100,000 Pennsylvania preschoolers participate in state taxpayer funded pre-kindergarten programs. In 2013, the federal government spends $8 billion for preschool programs nationwide. In 2013, Pennsylvania was awarded a $51.7 million federal grant to fund early learning programs. The funding will be used to create 50 Early Childhood Education Community Innovation Zones in areas where the lowest- performing public schools, including charter schools, exist. The federal dollars will not be used to provide seats for children in preschools. Instead the money will be used to build bureaucracy and added training for teachers/providers. Classrooms for the Future grant The Classroom for the Future state program provided districts with hundreds of thousands of extra state funding to buy laptop computers for each core curriculum high school class (English, Science, History, Math) and paid for teacher training to optimize the computers use. The program was funded from 2006 to 2009. The School District did not apply to participate in 2006-07 or in 2007-08. The district received $174,072 in 2008-2009. Among the public school districts in Lancaster County the highest award was given to Lancaster School District which received $1,193,377. The highest funding statewide was awarded to Philadelphia City School District in Philadelphia County - $9,409,073. The grant program was discontinued by Governor Edward Rendell as part of the 2009-2010 state budget. =Other grants= Cocalico School District did not participate in: Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection's Environmental Education annual grants; PA Science Its Elementary grants (discontinued effective with 2009-10 budget by Governor Rendell);Pennsylvania Department of Education, Science: It‚Äôs Elementary Grantees Students in 143 Schools Benefit from Intensive Science Curriculum, July 22, 2008 Education Assistance Grants; 2012 Striving Readers Comprehensive Literacy grant; 2013 Safe Schools and Resource Officer grants; 2012 and 2013 Pennsylvania Hybrid Learning Grants nor the federal 21st Century Learning grants. =Federal Stimulus grant= Cocalico School District received an extra $1,638,269 in American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) - Federal Stimulus money to be used in specific programs like special education and meeting the academic needs of low-income students. The funding was limited to the 2009-2010 and 2010-2011 school years. Due to the temporary nature of the funding, schools were repeatedly advised by the Pennsylvania Department of Education, the Pennsylvania Senate Education Committee, the Governor and the Pennsylvania School Board Association, to use the funds for one-time expenditures like acquiring equipment, making repairs to buildings, training teachers to provide more effective instruction or purchasing books and software. Race to the Top grant Cocalico School District officials did not apply for the federal Race to the Top grant which would have provided over one million dollars, in additional federal funding, to improve student academic achievement.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Race To The Top Webinar powerpoint for districts December 2009, December 9, 2009 Participation required the administration, the school board and the local teachers' union to sign an agreement to prioritize improving student academic success. In Pennsylvania, 120 public school districts and 56 charter schools agreed to participate. Pennsylvania was not approved for the grant. The failure of districts to agree to participate was cited as one reason that Pennsylvania was not approved.Race to the Top Fund, U.S. Department of Education, March 29, 2010. =Real estate taxes= Property tax rates in 2014-2015 were set by the Cocalico School Board at 22.3200 mills for Lancaster County residents and 12.8500 mills for residents in Berks County. A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's assessed value. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. Property taxes, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, apply only to real estate - land and buildings. The property tax is not levied on cars, business inventory, or other personal property. Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including: places of worship, places of burial, private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions and all government property (local, state and federal). Additionally, service related, disabled US military veterans may seek an exemption from paying property taxes. Pennsylvania school district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75-85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections, which are around 15% of revenues for school districts. When a Pennsylvania public school district includes municipalities in two counties, each of which has different rates of property tax assessment, a state board equalizes the tax rates between the counties. In 2010, miscalculations by the State Tax Equalization Board (STEB) were widespread in the Commonwealth and adversely impacted funding for many school districts, including those that did not cross county borders. *2013-14 - 21.7600 mills for Lancaster County residents. *2012-13 - 21.3200 mills for Lancaster County residents and 19.1100 mills for residents in Berks County. *2011-12 - 20.8900 mills for Lancaster County residents and 21.3800 mills for residents in Berks County. *2010-11 - 20.5500 mills for Lancaster County residents and 21.8000 mills for residents in Berks County. *2009-10 - 19.8400 mills for Lancaster County residents and 22.2100 mills for residents in Berks County.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Financial Elements Reports, 2010 *2008-09 - 18.9100 mills for Lancaster County residents and 21.2100 mills for residents in Berks County.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Financial Elements Reports 2008-09 Real Estate Mills, 2009 *2007-08 - 17.9300 mills for Lancaster County residents and 17.9300 mills for residents in Berks County.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2008 *2006-07 - 17.0000 mills for Lancaster County residents and 17.0000 mills for residents in Berks County.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2006 *2005-06 - 16.4200 mills for Lancaster County residents Pennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2005 The average yearly property tax paid by Lancaster County residents amounts to about 401% of their yearly income. lancaster County ranked 231st out of the 3143 United States counties for property taxes as a percentage of median income.Tax-rates.org., The 2013 Tax Resource County Property Taxes 2012, 2012 According to a report prepared by the Pennsylvania Department of Education, the total real estate taxes collected by all school districts in Pennsylvania rose from $6,474,133,936 in 1999-00 to $10,438,463,356 in 2008-09 and to $11,153,412,490 in 2011.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Pennsylvania School Finances - Summaries of Annual Financial Report Data 2010-11, 2011 Property taxes in Pennsylvania are relatively high on a national scale.

Founded in 1857, the settlement was initially known as Deer Creek until it was renamed after its only postmaster, Sylvester Stull. As of 2018, only a handful of structures remain in the area. Since the 1970s, the town has become infamous due to an apocryphal legend that claims the nearby Stull Cemetery is possessed by demonic forces. This legend has become a facet of American popular culture and has been referenced in numerous forms of media. This legend has also led to controversies with current residents of Stull. Geography Stull is located at (38.9711124, -95.4560872), at the corner of North 1600 Road () and East 250 Road () in Douglas County, which is 7 miles west from the outskirts of Lawrence and 10 miles east of the Topeka city limit. History =Founding= Stull first appeared on territorial maps in 1857.Stull Bicentennial Committee (1976). During this time, the settlement was called Deer Creek.Thomas (2017), p. 116. It is unclear where this name came from, although Martha Parker and Betty Laird speculate that it could either be a translation of an indigenous location name or that it could have arisen after a deer was seen by a body of water.Parker & Laird (1976), p. 93. The first European settlers in the area spoke German as their native language. Some had come from Pennsylvania Dutch Country, whereas others had recently fled the German Confederation \\"for more freedom and to escape military duty.\\" =19th century= During the late 1850s, the handful of families living in Deer Creek organized a church that met in the homes of its members until 1867, when a stone structure called the \\"Evangelical Emmanuel and Deer Creek Mission\\" was built; this church later became known simply as \\"Evangelical Emmanuel Church\\".Lecompton Historical Society (1990). Until 1908, the sermons at the small chapel were preached in German.Parker & Laird (1976), pp. 934. In 1867, a cemetery was chartered for the town next to the church. In 1922, those living in Stull raised $20,000 to construct a new, wooden-framed church across the road. The following year, the church changed its official name from \\"Deer Creek Church\\" to \\"Stull Evangelical Church\\". The old stone Evangelical Emmanuel Church was abandoned by the community in 1922, and over the course of the 20th century, the church slowly fell into a greater and greater state of decrepitude, finally being demolished in 2002. Due to a growing congregation from Stull and Lecompton, a larger church was eventually needed, so in 1919, the community voted to build a new church. In 1922 a new church was built and eventually got the name ‚ÄúUnited Methodist Zion Church‚Äù in 1968. This new church holds services and meetings that continue today under the name Stull United Methodist Church. In the late 1890s, a telephone switchboard was added to the house of a Stull resident named J. E. Louk, and soon thereafter, on April 27, 1899, a post office was established in the back of the very same building. The town's first and only postmaster was Sylvester Stull, from whom the town derived its name.Fitzgerald (2009), p. 103. According to Parker and Laird, the United States post office simply selected the name based on the name of the postmaster.Parker & Laird (1976), p. 98. The name stuck even after the post office was discontinued in 1903. Stull residents opened two schools prior to Kansas being admitted to the Union. The first school only lasted for about five years, the other school named ‚ÄúDeer Creek‚Äù experienced increasing enrollments and started being used for church services by the Lutheran congregation and the United Brethren on Sundays. Along with church services, the school held debates, voting for general elections, and competitions in baseball, horseshoes, sewing, and cooking. The school continued until 1962 when it closed; students thereafter went to Lecompton to continue their education. Farming brought the community new hope and continues to be the common livelihood of the remaining residents. Construction on the Clinton Reservoir led to changes in road routes and farming locations. While this did mean the loss of farms to eminent domain and county purchase, it helped Stull and its surrounding communities become more progressive. =20th century= In 1912, only 31 people lived in the Stull area, and at its maximum size the settlement comprised about fifty individuals.Blackmar (1912), p. 782. Christ Kraft, an inhabitant of the settlement during the 20th century, recalls that life in the small town was \\"quiet and easy, sometimes even boring.\\" Before automobiles were popular in the area, trips to Lecompton, Lawrence, and Topeka, took two, three, and four hours, respectively. In early 20th century, organized baseball became popular in the area, and members of Stull played in a league with members from other Clinton Lake communities, like Clinton and Lone Star. Eventually, a baseball diamond was constructed in Stull. During this time, hunting rabbits was also a popular activity,Parker & Laird (1976), p. 102. and it was not uncommon for the Stull community to bring hauls of about 300 freshly-killed rabbits to butchers in Topeka. During the early 20th century, a number of businesses were established in the area, but most were short-lived; the exception to this general trend was the Louk & Kraft grocery store, which was established in the early 1900s and lasted until 1955. The Roaring Twenties brought preliminary discussion about constructing an interurban railroad line between Kansas City and Emporia that would have run through Stull.Chambers and Tompkins (1977), p. 42. Anticipating that their city was about to grow, the residents of Stull began discussing the idea of establishing a \\"Farmers State Bank\\" in the area; the Lecompton-based banker J. W. Kreider even secured an official bank charter. However, neither the railway or the bank were ever built, possibly due to the advent of the Great Depression.Parker & Laird (1976), p. 101. During the 20th century, the settlement suffered two major tragedies. The first occurred when Oliver Bahnmaier, a young boy wandered into a field that his father was burning and died. Oliver‚Äôs tragic death led to the rumor that if one stepped on Oliver‚Äôs tombstone, they would go to Hell. The second occurred when a man was found hanging from a tree after going missing.Parker & Laird (1976), pp. 1023. Legend of Stull Cemetery The Stull Cemetery has gained an ominous reputation due to urban legends involving Satan, the occult, and a purported \\"gateway to Hell\\". The rumors about the cemetery were popularized by a November 1974 issue of The University Daily Kansan (the student newspaper of the University of Kansas), which claimed that the Devil appeared in Stull twice a year: once on Halloween, and once on the spring equinox.Smarsh (2010), p. 117.Heitz (1997), pp. 10207. People soon said that the cemetery was the location of one of the seven gates to Hell and that the nearby Evangelical Emmanuel Church ruin was \\"possessed\\" by the Devil. Others claimed (erroneously) that the legend was engendered by the killing of Stull‚Äôs mayor back in the 1850s (of note, Stull was never organized as a town, so never had a mayor). It is also said that during a trip to Colorado in the 1990s, the Pope redirected the flight path of his private plane to avoid flying over the unholy ground of Stull (although there is no evidence that this happened). Most academics, historians, and local residents are in agreement that the legend has no basis in historical fact and was created and spread by students.Thomas (2017), pp. 11624. In the years that followed the publication of the University Daily Kansan article, the legend persuaded thrill seekers to visit the cemetery, and they would claim that weird and creepy events such as noises and memory lapses happened to them leading to further speculation that the town was haunted by witches and the devil. It became a popular activity for young folks (especially high school and college students from Lawrence or Topeka) to journey to the cemetery on Halloween or the equinox to \\"see the Devil\\". Many would jump fences or otherwise sneak their way onto the property. Over the decades, as the number of people making excursions to the cemetery grew, the graveyard started to deteriorate; this was exacerbated by vandals. To combat this, the county's sheriff office patrols the area around the cemetery, especially on Halloween, and will arrest people for trespassing. Those caught inside the cemetery after it is closed could face a maximum fine of $1,000 and up to six months in jail. = In popular culture = Despite its dubious origins, the legend of Stull Cemetery has been referenced numerous times in popular culture. The band Urge Overkill released the Stull EP in 1992, which features the church and a tombstone from the cemetery on the cover.Kugelberg (1992), p. 16. It has been argued that the British band The Cure canceled their show in Kansas because of Stull‚Äôs cemetery, although this too is false. Films whose plot is based on the legends include Turbulence 3: Heavy Metal (2001), Nothing Left to Fear (2013), and the unreleased film Sin- Jin Smyth. The cemetery is also the site of the final confrontation between Lucifer and Michael in \\"Swan Song\\", the season five finale of the television series Supernatural and the History Channel documentary.Engstrom (2014), p. 95. In-universe, Sam and Dean Winchester (the series' protagonists) are from Lawrence; in a 2006 interview, Eric Kripke (the creator of Supernatural) revealed that he decided to have the two brothers be from Lawrence because of its closeness to Stull. In an interview with Complex Magazine, pop star Ariana Grande talked about her unsuccessful attempt to visit Stull and stated that she was attacked by demons.

It is an Ad Hoc Routing Protocol which is reactive or on-demand, meaning that it establishes routes as needed. The advantage of this approach is obvious if only a few routes are needed, since the routing overhead is less compared to the proactive approach of establishing routes whether or not they are needed. The disadvantage of on- demand establishment of routes is that connections take more time if the route needs to be established. MOR lessens the disadvantages of on-demand routing in wireless sensor networks by having the likely targets of communication perform an initial broadcast. This allows all recipients to have a route to these nodes. The main characteristic distinguishing MOR from other ad hoc routing protocols is that it maintains multiple routes to each destination, when available, whereas most other such protocols only keep a single route. There are many advantages to having multiple routes when possible, including * increased reliability * potentially better load balancing * more even energy consumption (a consequence of better load balancing) Each node in MOR remembers all next-hop nodes that are closer to a given destination for which a route exists. It then sends successive packets to each such node in round- robin fashion. If a next-hop node fails to acknowledge a given packet, the retransmission is attempted to another node, again if possible. This allows automatic and graceful recovery from occasional localized congestion as well as longer-term reasons for node unavailability.
