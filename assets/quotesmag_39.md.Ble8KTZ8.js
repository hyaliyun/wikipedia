He was signed by the Chicago Bears after going undrafted in the 2012 NFL Draft. He played at college at Louisiana Tech and Texas Southern. College career After graduating from Texas High School, Anderson attended Louisiana Tech University before transferring to Texas Southern, where he played for three years, playing in 34 games. He recorded 154 catches for 2010 yards and 13 touchdowns. Anderson also served as return specialist, returning 16 kickoffs for 289 yards.

Professional career Anderson was not drafted in the 2012 NFL Draft, and was later called by the Chicago Bears. After rookie minicamp, Anderson was officially signed by the team. In the third preseason game against the New York Giants, Anderson broke free to score the game- winning touchdown. On August 31, Anderson was among the final cuts, though he was later signed to the practice squad the following day. On October 30, Anderson was released from the practice squad, and replaced by Raymond Radway. Anderson was later brought back on November 6. He was later activated to the active roster after Robbie Gould was placed on injured reserve.

Constructed in the early twentieth century, it has endured closure and a series of modifications to survive to the present day, and it has been declared a historic site. Used only occasionally for many years, it is one of the most important buildings in a large historic district on the city's west side. History By the 1890s, the Monon Railroad was serving Bloomington and operating maintenance shops on the city's southern side.Monon , Bloomington Historic Preservation Commission, n.d. Accessed 2011-10-25. In 1902, desiring service from a second railroad, Bloomington and Perry Townships offered a large cash bonus to whichever company would add a second rail line in the city. Four years later, Illinois Central Railroad took up the offer, and upon finishing its route into the city, it decided to erect a station dedicated to freight traffic. Note: This includes and Accompanying photographs. Designed by the railroad's staff architects, it is a simple building without unneeded elements; its architecture was determined by the features that the railroad needed to operate a train station. From its earliest years, the depot played an important part in the development of Bloomington's heavy industries: many limestone mills and the large Showers Brothers furniture factory were located in its immediate vicinity.Indiana Historic Sites and Structures Inventory. City of Bloomington Interim Report. Bloomington: City of Bloomington, 2004-04, 19-20. At the time of construction, the depot was a simple rectangle, long and wide. It was greatly expanded in 1922 by the addition of a second story to much of the building. The northernmost portion of the building was removed in 1959, because falling freight traffic no longer required such a large building. After closing in 1963, the depot became a bar and grill restaurant; the restaurant later closed, leaving the building vacant, although another restaurant, Macri's at the Depot, opened inside by 2012.Contact Us , Macri's at the Depot, 2012. Accessed 2012-12-17. The building is currently used as office space by a private company. https://cfcproperties.com/commercial/bloomington/the-depot/ Commercial Building - The Depot], Commercial Building - The Depot,2020. Accessed 2020-06-12. Architecture The depot is a rectangular wooden building that rests on a foundation of concrete. Because the building's primary purpose was the transfer of goods between wagons and railroad cars, the ground floor is elevated above the street by about . When the depot was constructed, it measured from east to west, and from north to south, although the 1959 modification reduced the building to only long. Its exterior displays simple clapboarding, and the building is covered with a shallow-pitched gable roof of asphalt shingles. On both the street side and the rail side of the building (east and west respectively), the roof extends approximately past the edge of the building, in order to shelter the loading and unloading zones. This portion of the roof is one of the more distinctive sections of the depot from an architectural point of view: the rafters and braces were left uncovered at the overhangs. Large doors provide access to the large freight-handling rooms of the interior, which are lit by a combination of windows and skylights. The southern end of the station includes office space and a waiting room for businessmen. The roofline was altered by the expansion: a hip roof was created over the new second story, but the original first-story overhang for the loading zones was preserved. As a freight depot rather than a passenger station, the depot was built exclusively with efficiency in mind. No unnecessary decorations can be found on the structure, and it was built according to a generic design by the railroad's staff architects rather than being a unique production by local craftsmen or architects. Consequently, the station lacks a distinctive architectural style. Aside from the expansion in 1922 and the reduction in 1959, no substantial modifications have been made to the original design. Preservation In 1983, the building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the \\"Illinois Central Railroad Freight Depot\\", qualifying because of its place in local history. Its significance depended on the role it played for the city's furniture and limestone industries. Much of Bloomington's near west side was designated a historic district and listed on the National Register in 1997. Known as the Bloomington West Side Historic District, it encompasses approximately four hundred historic buildings,Brubaker, Cynthia, and Nancy Hiestand.

The depot was deemed one of the leading components of the district, due largely to its place as the sole railroad-related building within the district: the Illinois Central built multiple train stations, engine houses, and turntables near the district's eastern edge, but only the freight depot remained by 1987.

The church was decorated in gold and scarlet cloth, two thrones were placed before the altar, and the Swiss Guard and court officials were finely attired. Benjamin Ursinus represented the Calvinist clergy while Bernhard von Sanden represented the Lutherans. Approximately 4,000 guests were in attendance for the anointing.Gause II, pp. 4-5 From 1705 to 1710 Joachim Ludwig Schulthei√ü von Unfriedt decorated the church with galleries, a royal box, and high altar.

He moved to Seattle in 1985. He has said he was first influenced to dye his hair by the wild styles he saw around Pike Place Market, but soon went well beyond the street fashion of the time to develop his unique look.

The former was a botanical garden planned by Johann Georg Scheffner in 1796 and opened west of the church in 1809. The Botanischer Garten was separated from the Volksgarten to the west by the street Steindammer Wallstra√üe. Located within the Volksgarten were the K√∂nigsberg Observatory and the 1877 Kriegerdenkmal, a war memorial honoring soldiers killed during the Franco-Prussian War.Albinus, p. 97 Friedrich Bessel, Theodor Gottlieb von Hippel the Elder, and Franz Ernst Neumann were buried in Neurossgarten's Ehrenfriedhof cemetery.

Some cabinets stand alone while others are built in to a wall or are attached to it like a medicine cabinet. Cabinets are typically made of wood (solid or with veneers or artificial surfaces), coated steel (common for medicine cabinets), or synthetic materials. Commercial grade cabinets, which differ in the materials used, are called casework, casegoods, or case furniture. Cabinets usually have one or more doors on the front, which are mounted with door hardware, and occasionally a lock. Cabinets may have one or more doors, drawers, and/or shelves. Short cabinets often have a finished surface on top that can be used for display, or as a working surface, such as the countertops found in kitchens. A cabinet intended to be used in a bedroom and with several drawers typically placed one above another in one or more columns intended for clothing and small articles is called a chest of drawers. A small bedside cabinet is more frequently called a nightstand or night table. A tall cabinet intended for clothing storage including hanging of clothes is called a wardrobe or an armoire, or (in some countries) a closet if built-in.  History  Commode by Andr√©-Charles Boulle at Vaux-le-Vicomte Before the advent of industrial design, cabinet makers were responsible for the conception and the production of any piece of furniture. In the last half of the 18th century, cabinet makers, such as Thomas Sheraton, Thomas Chippendale, Shaver and Wormley Bros. Cabinet Constructors, and George Hepplewhite, also published books of furniture forms. These books were compendiums of their designs and those of other cabinet makers. The most famous cabinetmaker before the advent of industrial design is probably Andr√©-Charles Boulle (11 November 1642 ‚Äì 29 February 1732) and his legacy is known as \\"Boulle Work\\" and the √âcole Boulle, a college of fine arts and crafts and applied arts in Paris, today bears testimony to his Art. Tortoise-shell cabinet of Polish king John III Sobieski, looted by the Germans from the Wilan√≥w Palace during World War II With the industrial revolution and the application of steam power to cabinet making tools, mass production techniques were gradually applied to nearly all aspects of cabinet making, and the traditional cabinet shop ceased to be the main source of furniture, domestic or commercial. In parallel to this evolution there came a growing demand by the rising middle class in most industrialised countries for finely made furniture. This eventually resulted in a growth in the total number of traditional cabinet makers. Before 1650, fine furniture was a rarity in Western Europe and North America. Generally, people did not need it and for the most part could not afford it. They made do with simple but serviceable pieces. The arts and craft movement which started in the United Kingdom in the middle of the 19th century spurred a market for traditional cabinet making, and other craft goods. It rapidly spread to the United States and to all the countries in the British Empire. This movement exemplified the reaction to the eclectic historicism of the Victorian era and to the 'soulless' machine-made production which was starting to become widespread. During this time, cabinetry was said to be one of the most noble and admirable skills by nearly one fourth of the population of the United Kingdom, and 31% of those who believed this strived for their children to learn the art of cabinetry. After World War II woodworking became a popular hobby among the middle classes. The more serious and skilled amateurs in this field now turn out pieces of furniture which rival the work of professional cabinet makers. Together, their work now represents but a small percentage of furniture production in any industrial country, but their numbers are vastly greater than those of their counterparts in the 18th century and before.  Schools of design  Crafted by Hughes Sambin (1570-1600), double cabinet features the combination of architectural elements and relief carving that is characteristic of French furniture of the period.  Scandinavian  This style of design is typified by clean horizontal and vertical lines. Compared to other designs there is a distinct absence of ornamentation. While Scandinavian design is easy to identify, it is much more about the materials than the design.  French Provincial  This style of design is ornate. French Provincial objects are often stained or painted, leaving the wood concealed. Corners and bevels are often decorated with gold leaf or given some other kind of gilding. Flat surfaces often have artwork such as landscapes painted directly on them. The wood used in French provincial varied, but was often originally beech.  Early American Colonial  This design emphasises both form and materials. Early American chairs and tables are often constructed with turned spindles and chair backs often constructed using steaming to bend the wood. Wood choices tend to be deciduous hardwoods with a particular emphasis on the wood of edible or fruit-bearing trees such as cherry or walnut.  Rustic  The rustic style of design sometimes called \\"log furniture\\" or \\"log cabin\\" is the least finished. Design is very utilitarian yet seeks to feature not only the materials used but in, as much as possible, how they existed in their natural state. For example, a table top may have what is considered a \\"live edge\\" that allows you to see the original contours of the tree that it came from. It also often uses whole logs or branches including the bark of the tree. Rustic furniture is often made from pine, cedar, fir and spruce. Also see Adirondack Architecture.  Mission Style  Mission Design is characterized by straight, thick horizontal and vertical lines and flat panels. The most common material used in Mission furniture is oak. For early mission cabinetmakers, the material of choice was white oak, which they often darkened through a process known as \\"fuming\\". Hardware is often visible on the outside of the pieces and made of black iron. It is a style that became popular in the early 20th century; popularized by designers in the Arts and Crafts and Art Nouveaux movements.  Oriental  Also known as Asian Design, this style of furniture is characterized by its use of materials such as bamboo and rattan. Red is a frequent color choice along with landscape art and Chinese or other Asian language characters on the pieces.  Shaker  Shaker furniture design is focused on function and symmetry. Because it is so influenced by an egalitarian religious community and tradition it is rooted in the needs of the community versus the creative expression of the designer. Like Early American and Colonial design, Shaker craftsmen often chose fruit woods for their designs. Pieces reflect a very efficient use of materials.  Types of cabinetry  The fundamental focus of the cabinet maker is the production of cabinetry. Although the cabinet maker may also be required to produce items that would not be recognized as cabinets, the same skills and techniques apply. A cabinet may be built-in or free-standing. A built-in cabinet is usually custom made for a particular situation and it is fixed into position, on a floor, against a wall, or framed in an opening. For example, modern kitchens are examples of built-in cabinetry. Free-standing cabinets are more commonly available as off-the-shelf items and can be moved from place to place if required. Cabinets may be wall hung or suspended from the ceiling. Cabinet doors may be hinged or sliding and may have mirrors on the inner or outer surface. Cabinets may have a face frame or may be of frameless construction (also known as European or euro-style). Face frame cabinets have a supporting frame attached to the front of the cabinet box. This face frame is usually in width. Mounted on the cabinet frame is the cabinet door. In contrast, frameless cabinet have no such supporting front face frame, the cabinet doors attach directly to the sides of the cabinet box. The box's side, bottom and top panels are usually thick, with the door overlaying all but of the box edge. Modern cabinetry is often frameless and is typically constructed from man-made sheet materials, such as plywood, chipboard or medium-density fibreboard (MDF). The visible surfaces of these materials are usually clad in a timber veneer, plastic laminate, or other material. They may also be painted.  Cabinet components   Bases  Cabinets which rest on the floor are supported by some base. This base could be a fully enclosed base (i.e. a plinth), a scrolled based, bracket feet or it could be a set of legs.  Adjustable feet  A type of adjustable leg has been adopted from the European cabinet system which offers several advantages. First off, in making base cabinets for kitchens, the cabinet sides would be cut to 34¬Ω inches, yielding four cabinet side blanks per 4 foot by 8 foot sheet. Using the adjustable feet, the side blanks are cut to 30 inches, thus yielding six cabinet side per sheet. These feet can be secured to the bottom of the cabinet by having the leg base screwed onto the cabinet bottom. They can also be attached by means of a hole drilled through the cabinet bottom at specific locations. The legs are then attached to the cabinet bottom by a slotted, hollow machine screw. The height of the cabinet can be adjusted from inside the cabinet, simply by inserting a screwdriver into the slot and turning to raise or lower the cabinet. The holes in the cabinet are capped by plastic inserts, making the appearance more acceptable for residential cabinets. Using these feet, the cabinets need not be shimmed or scribed to the floor for leveling. The toe kick board is attached to the cabinet by means of a clip, which is either screwed onto the back side of the kick board, or a barbed plastic clip is inserted into a saw kerf, also made on the back side of the kick board. This toe kick board can be made to fit each base cabinet, or made to fit a run of cabinets. Kitchen cabinets, or any cabinet generally at which a person may stand, usually have a fully enclosed base in which the front edge has been set back 75 mm or so to provide room for toes, known as the kick space. A scrolled base is similar to the fully enclosed base but it has areas of the base material removed, often with a decorative pattern, leaving feet on which the cabinet stands. Bracket feet are separate feet, usually attached in each corner and occasionally for larger pieces in the middle of the cabinet.  Compartments  A cabinet usually has at least one compartment. Compartments may be open, as in open shelving; they may be enclosed by one or more doors; or they may contain one or more drawers. Some cabinets contain secret compartments, access to which is generally not obvious. Modern cabinets employ many more complicated means (relative to a simple shelf) of making browsing lower cabinets more efficient and comfortable. One example is the lazy susan, a shelf which rotates around a central axis, allowing items stored at the back of the cabinet to be brought to the front by rotating the shelf. These are usually used in corner cabinets, which are larger and deeper and have a greater \\"dead space\\" at the back than other cabinets.  Cabinet insert hardware  An alternative to the lazy susan, particularly in base cabinets, is the blind corner cabinet pull out unit. These pull out and turn, making the attached shelving unit slide into the open area of the cabinet door, thus making the shelves accessible to the user. These units make usable what was once dead space. Other insert hardware includes such items as mixer shelves that pull out of a base cabinet and spring into a locked position at counter height. This hardware aids in lifting these somewhat heavy mixers and assists with positioning the unit for use. More and more components are being designed to enable specialized hardware to be used in standard cabinet carcasses.  Tops  Most cabinets incorporate a top of some sort. In many cases, the top is merely to enclose the compartments within and serves no other purpose‚Äîas in a wall hung cupboard for example. In other cabinets, the top also serves as a work surface‚Äîa kitchen countertop for example.

Its territory is now part of Kaliningrad, Russia. History Laak's name was of Old Prussian origin and referred to an open field,Seraphim, p. 264 marshland,Gause I, p. 4 or a brooklet called Lack/Lacke which ran south of the later road named Laak.Karl, p. 160 Laak consisted of flat meadow land before becoming a medieval Freiheit suburb of Altstadt.Frischbier, p. 1 Because of the wetness of the land, development of Laak was first concentrated to the north along the hill Rollberg before continuing to the west and south. Laak was bounded by Neurossgarten to the north, Altstadt to the east, Lastadie to the south, and the early 17th century Baroque city walls to the west. Beyond the walls were Kosse and Mittelhufen. Laak was closely affiliated with the Lastadie warehouse quarter and Lizent toll district. By the Rath√§usliche Reglement of 13 June 1724, King Frederick William I of Prussia merged Altstadt and Laak into the united city of K√∂nigsberg.Gause II, p. 65 Laak was heavily damaged by the 1944 Bombing of K√∂nigsberg and 1945 Battle of K√∂nigsberg. Locations Laak was divided into Unterlaak (Lower Laak) to the east and Oberlaak (Upper Laak) to the west. Unterlaak ran from the western end of Altstadt's Altst√§dtische Langgasse until Lizentgrabenstra√üe, while Oberlaak continued from Lizentgrabenstra√üe to Deutschordensring at the western city walls. Unterlaak contained a medieval ropewalk along Reifschl√§gergasse. The city's fire department moved to Unterlaak in 1866. Also found in eastern Laak was the mercantile Markthalle.M√ºhlpfordt, p. 87 The Laakspeicherstra√üen were three roads connecting Unterlaak to Lastadie. Institutions in Oberlaak included the city employment office (Arbeitsamt), an anatomical institute (the Anatomie) of the University of K√∂nigsberg headed by Karl Friedrich Burdach in 1836, and a forensic institute (Gerichtsmedizinisches Institut) headed by Georg Puppe in 1903.Albinus, p. 324 The foundry Union Giesserei K√∂nigsberg was located between Oberlaak and Neuro√ügarten's Botanischer Garten.

Its territory is now part of Kaliningrad, Russia. Etymology The name Lastadie is derived from the Medieval Latin Lastagium, referring specifically to sailing ballast and generally to loading docks.M√ºhlpfordt, p. 88 In Old High German it became ladastat and in Middle Low German Lastadie.Frischbier II, p. 11 In the Low Prussian dialect of K√∂nigsberg it was pronounced Lastaadje.Albinus, p. 197 While medieval docks were also built by Kneiphof (in Vordere Vorstadt) and L√∂benicht (in neighboring Anger), the usage of \\"Lastadie\\" in K√∂nigsberg referred almost exclusively to those of Altstadt built south of Laak. History Lastadie warehouses The oldest docks of K√∂nigsberg were located on an island then known as Vogtswerder within the Pregel River. The 1286 charter of Altstadt allowed the town to build these initial docks (later known as the Kai, meaning quay) on the western coast of the island, connected to Altstadt by the Gr√ºne Br√ºcke (Green Bridge).Reinicke, pp 102-103 With the establishment of Kneiphof on the island Vogtswerder as a rival town in 1327, however, Altstadt was forced to move its dock operation. Documented in 1339,B√∂tticher, p. 247 the new Lastadie docks were built to the southwest outside of Altstadt's original walls. This new warehouse district was eventually bounded by the roads Neuer Graben and Reifschl√§gerstra√üe to the west and north, respectively, and the Pregel to the east and south.Antoni, p. 318 In 1804 Ludwig von Baczko described Lastadie as being bounded by Altstadt, Laak, the Pregel, the 17th century city walls, and Holl√§nder Baum.Baczko, p. 163 Medieval Lastadie was burned down by troops from Elbing (ElblƒÖg) and Frauenburg (Frombork) led by Johann Schalski (Jan Szalski) in 1464 during the Thirteen Years' War.Armstedt, p. 100 Altstadt's slaughterhouse was documented in Lastadie in 1613, but was probably built earlier. By the Rath√§usliche Reglement of 13 June 1724, King Frederick William I of Prussia merged Altstadt and Lastadie into the united city of K√∂nigsberg.Gause II, p. 65 The great fire of 11 November 1764 caused by a sailmaker in Lastadie was carried to eastern K√∂nigsberg by wind and heavily damaged L√∂benicht and Sackheim.Gause II, p. 168 Damaged by a fire in 1839,M√ºhlpfordt, p. 52 Lastadie's importance declined with the construction of K√∂nigsberg's modern docks near Contienen after World War I. Lastadie was destroyed during the 1944 bombing of K√∂nigsberg in World War II. Buildings Workers along Lastadienstra√üe Lastadie was often referred to as K√∂nigsberg's Speicherviertel (warehouse quarter) or Hafenviertel (harbor quarter), because of its numerous multi-storied FachwerkGuttzeit, p. 12 warehouses built from the 16th-18th centuries. These decorated buildings had expressive names,M√ºhlpfordt, p. 135 such as Sonne, Adler, Glaube, L√∂we, B√§r, Taube, Merkur, and Pelikan.Armstedt, p. 248 The warehouses Hengst and Bulle dated to 1589. Altstadt's stock exchange, the B√∂rse, was located in Lastadie along the Hundegatt branch of the Pregel. It ceased its function as a stock exchange in 1724 during the unification of K√∂nigsberg and was later dismantled. A Mennonite church was located on Altst√§dtischer Tr√§nkgasse since 1 January 1770. Bordering the warehouses was the mercantile district Lizent, where tolls charged on goods arriving from the Pregel were collected at the Lizenthaus.Albinus, p. 202 Much of K√∂nigsberg's Dutch, English, Swedish, and Danish population settled in Lizent.Armstedt, p. 247 Pillauer Bahnhof with Neurossgarten Church in the background The Holl√§nder Baum was a barricade of chained tree branches located at the exit of the Pregel from the city, near Krausenecksche Wallstra√üe and the medieval city walls. Used to enforce tolls on ships arriving from the west, the Holl√§nder Baum was first documented in 1459Gause I, p. 44 and probably rebuilt by 1570.B√∂tticher, p. 173 It was named after the large number of ships from medieval Holland which traded in the city.Frischbier I, p. 58 The Litauer Baum by Sackheim in eastern K√∂nigsberg was a similar barricade. West of Lizent and south of Laak were the 15th century Klapperwiese or Klappholzwiese,M√ºhlpfordt, p. 73 meadows used for the storage of clapholt or clapboard staves.K√∂nigsberg's other Klapperwiese were in Vordere Vorstadt. The meadows, later known as the Lizentwiese, were gradually developed. Located on the thoroughfare Holl√§nderbaumstra√üe (formerly Holzwiesenstra√üe) was a Hauptzollamt office (formerly Lizenthaus), which administered ship and rail tolls. To the west was the Heeresverpflegung-Hauptamt, the food supply office of the army. The Lizentbahnhof, also known as the Pillauer Bahnhof, was a train station constructed in 1865 in the former meadow land, located along Lizentgrabenstra√üe north of the bridge Eisenbahnbr√ºcke (built 1863-65). This was replaced in 1929 by the opening of Bahnhof Holl√§nderbaum north of the bridge Reichsbahnbr√ºcke (built 1913). Notes References  Reicke, Rudolf (ed).

Ed. and L. Ed. 2d in case citations) is an unofficial reporter of Supreme Court of the United States opinions. The Lawyers' Edition was established by the Lawyers Cooperative Publishing Company of Rochester, New York in 1882, and features coverage of Supreme Court decisions going back to 1790. The first Lawyers' Edition series corresponds to the official United States Reports from volume 1 to volume 351, whereas the second series contains cases starting from the official reporter volume 352. The Lawyers' Edition differs from the official reporter in that the editors write headnotes and case summaries, as well as provide annotations to some cases, and decisions are published far in advance of the official reporter. As such, it is similar to West's unofficial Supreme Court Reporter (S. Ct.). Lawyers' Edition case reports differ from Supreme Court Reporter case reports in three respects. First, coverage in Supreme Court Reporter does not begin until Johnson v. Waters, 108 U.S. 4 (1882), while Lawyers' Edition covers opinions back to the first volume of United States Reports. Second, while both reporters contain headnotes written by the reporters' editors, the Lawyers' Edition headnotes are not keyed to the West American Digest System's topic and key number system. Third, Lawyers' Edition historically included analytical articles, referred to as \\"annotations\\", similar to those contained in American Law Reports. LexisNexis, by way of Reed Elsevier, acquired the rights to the Lawyers' Edition, along with a number of other law publications and related assets, from The Thomson Corporation in January 1997.

Lomse was located on the western end of Lomse Island in the Pregel River; the large island is now known as October Island (). The Neuer Pregel, the northern branch of the river, separated Lomse from Kneiphof to the west, Altstadt to the northwest, and L√∂benicht to the north. Lomse's territory is now part of Kaliningrad's Moskovsky District and Lomse is now known as Oktyabrsky Island, in honor of the October Revolution. History Lomse's name was of Old Prussian origin and referred to marshland. Only the western end of the island was heavily developed, with the remainder consisting mostly of meadows. The land was granted to Altstadt in 1286 and was initially used as a lumberyard and then as a warehouse quarter. Kneiphof feared that Altstadt's control of Lomse would lead to a trade war; in 1434 Grand Master Paul von Rusdorf negotiated a compromise in which only sties and barns would be built at a prescribed distance from the river.Gause I, p. 54 By the Rath√§usliche Reglement of 13 June 1724, King Frederick William I of Prussia merged Altstadt and Lomse into the united city of K√∂nigsberg.Gause II, p. 65 Locations Prominent roads in northern Lomse were the western Vorderlomse and eastern Hinterlomse. The latter was also known as Seilerbahn because of the rope produced there (see also Reeperbahn).Karl, p. 64 Lomse was connected to Altstadt and L√∂benicht by the northern Holzbr√ºcke (Wood Bridge), constructed by the burghers of Altstadt in 1404.M√ºhlpfordt, p. 92 This bridge connected with Lindenstra√üe, which was originally the Ochsenmarkt (oxen market) and then a grain market. In 1838 53 linden trees were planted there; locals called it the Lindenmarkt (linden market).Albinus, p. 201 Much of K√∂nigsberg's Polish population was settled along Lindenstra√üe and the neighboring shores of the Pregel.Armstedt, p. 247 Approval of the southern Hohe Br√ºcke (High Bridge) to connect Lomse with Haberberg over the southern Alter Pregel was granted in 1377, but it was not until 1500-20 that the bridge, then known as the Newe Br√ºcke, was actually built. Burghers from insular Kneiphof began to settle in Lomse after the completion of the Honigbr√ºcke (Honey Bridge) connected the two islands in 1542. King Frederick II financed a mulberry plantation (Plantage) in Lomse in 1742, but the plants froze during the harsh winter of 1771.Albinus, p. 244 The Protestant Kreuzkirche was built along the Plantage from 1930-33. The liberal Neue Synagoge (new synagogue), built along Lindenstra√üe from 1894-96, was burned down during the Night of Broken Glass in 1938. The Kypkeanum on Hinterlomse was a dormitory established in 1778 by the philologist Georg David Kypke for students of the University of K√∂nigsberg.Albinus, p. 191 To the south Lindenstra√üe became the Weidendamm, which was named after its decorative willow trees. Weidendamm was first developed by Altstadt during the 1455 siege of Kneiphof, part of the Thirteen Years' War, and was used as a warehouse quarter. It connected to Vorstadt by the Kaiserbr√ºcke (Emperor Bridge) and to Haberberg by the Hohe Br√ºcke (High Bridge). Working class Weidendamm had one of the highest birth rates in the city at the start of the 20th century.Gause II, p. 760 Of the Seven Bridges of K√∂nigsberg made famous by the mathematical problem solved by Leonhard Euler, three connected to Lomse.

He has been described as \\"a renowned author from Chicago\\" and \\"one of the foremost authorities on Elvis Presley,\\" authoring, self-publishing, and producing over 55 titles about Presley for the past 32 years. Tunzi has also compiled a massive photo archive, from which he licenses photographs of Presley. Adam Victor referred to Tunzi in his 2008 publication, The Elvis Encyclopedia as \\"one of the world's most prolific Elvis authors, with more than twenty books to his name, specializing in photo books about specific events and tours through his own publishing operation, J.A.T. Productions.\\"The Elvis Encyclopedia, Overlook Duckworth, October 2, 2008, (United States) (United Kingdom), Adam Victor, Page 541 Victor went on to write in The Elvis Encyclopedia that \\"many of Tunzi's books feature exclusive interviews and recordings and that he has also published a number of DVD titles, including the Elvis Presley Hot Shots and Cool Clips series.\\" AMICI Journal wrote of Tunzi, \\"deciding to focus purely on his writing and publishing, building a huge archive of photos, every book Tunzi has released has included a plethora of rare photographs. With their beautiful layouts, and accurate information, Tunzi quickly built a reputation as a top writer and archivist.\\" Tunzi is listed under American Authors on NobelAuthors.com .http://nobelauthors.com/american-authors/ Additionally, Tunzi has been interviewed by several television and radio programs as well as for several newspaper articles and websites throughout his career.http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1991-07-21/news/9103210465_1_natural- gas-explosions-natural-gas-al-russell Between 1972 and 1977, Tunzi routinely was a guest commentator on Roy Leonard's radio program on WGN, often offering opinions on Elvis Presley's latest record releases and Elvis' personal concert appearances, films and television specials he had recently witnessed, among other subjects. Tunzi also regularly appeared as a guest on Jay Gordon's radio program Elvis Only. Tunzi has been a guest on Sirius Satellite Radio's Elvis Radio (Channel 19), having been interviewed while in Memphis as well as via the telephone. Many of Tunzi's books are featured in libraries both in the United States and throughout the world.http://worldcat.org/identities/lccn-n91020629/  Early career  Tunzi worked at several radio stations in the Chicago area between 1972 and 1982 as an account executive in charge of selling radio advertisements.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubNKpGkhUs4 Tunzi's early work in radio meant that he was constantly attending learning seminars which gave him the equivalent of a college degree. He also owned Records For A Song, a Chicago area record shop in the late seventies.AMICI Journal, AMICI Journal Publications, Spring 2005, Mike Eder, Page 2, A Look At Joseph A. Tunzi In 1982, he formed his own publishing company, which up until 1987 strictly dealt with direct mail advertising. By 1985, Tunzi had stopped working for radio stations and began focusing his efforts towards becoming an entrepreneur in direct mail advertising.  First Book  By 1988 his company, JAT Publishing (name derived from his initials), diverted its efforts towards self-publishing books that eventually evolved to primarily featuring rare photographs of Elvis Presley throughout his life and career. His first self-published book, though, The First Elvis Video Price And Reference Guide, was a parody of the various price guides that were coming into the collectibles market at the time. As Mike Eder noted in his article, A Look At Joseph A. Tunzi in AMICI Journal (National Italian American Celebrity Magazine), \\"Feeling many of the values to be arbitrary, and also amused by the huge amount of publications, Joseph decided to do a parody price guide on Elvis Presley's videos.\\" As Eder further elaborated, \\"Tunzi deliberately used subtle humor to test out his theory that these guides were being given too much relevance in collectors' circles.\\" Steven Opdyke wrote in 1999 that \\"Tunzi had another claim to fame. In 1988, he compiled the first Elvis Presley video guide. It contained listings of movie prints, promotional tapes and foreign releases as part of its lengthy presentations. It also had pricing information, which was especially useful for obtaining items with limited distribution.\\"  Photo Journals  Beginning with Elvis, Encore Performance (Chicago 1972) and continuing to this day, Tunzi has written and self-published numerous photo journals on Presley. As Opdyke elaborated in his book, The Printed Elvis: The Complete Guide To Books About The King, \\"one can only say that Joseph Tunzi (like Elvis biographer Bill E. Burk) has done a ton of work on Elvis. Each book (all from a nineties perspective) has been limited to a specific time period in Elvis' career, concentrating on the music and performances. Taken together, they formed one of the most in-depth chronicles of the King's career from the late sixties forward.\\" Tunzi was also a forerunner in using newspaper photography from many award-winning photographers in his publications. Some of these photographers included Jack Lenahan of the Chicago Sun-Times newspaper, Bob Fila of the Chicago Tribune, Dean T. Musser of the Fort Wayne, Indiana's The Journal Gazette, Hank de Lespinasse, whose photos have appeared in publications such as Newsweek, Time (magazine), Fortune (magazine) and Sports Illustrated, Ken Ross of the Memphis Press-Scimitar and George Wilson of the Oklahoma Journal. Tunzi has also had a number of individuals that are mostly well-known in the Elvis fandom who knew or worked with Elvis Presley in some capacity write introductions for his books. These individuals include former RCA executive and producer Joan Deary and Bruce E. Banke, former director of publicity / public relations for what was formerly the International Hotel and Las Vegas Hilton but today is known as Westgate Las Vegas. Others include pianist Glen Hardin, keyboardist and producer David Briggs (American musician), guitarist James Burton, drummers Ron Tutt and Hal Blaine, costume designer Bill Belew (foreword only), bassist Duke Bardwell, television producer and director Steve Binder, backup vocalist Ray Walker (singer) of The Jordanaires, television producer and director Marty Pasetta, broadcaster Frank Page (broadcaster) (foreword only), radio personality Jerry G. Bishop, guitarist Scotty Moore and recording sound engineers Bill Porter (sound engineer) and Al Pachucki. In 2003, Tunzi's JAT Publishing published Russ Howe and Tom Salva's book of photographs of Elvis Presley performing at Nassau Coliseum on June 22‚Äì23, 1973.The Central New Jersey Home News Tribune (New Brunswick, New Jersey), Down With The King - Sounding Off By Chris Jordan, Chris Jordan, August 15, 2003, Pulse Page 4 Beginning with his twentieth year, 2008, Tunzi began publishing all of his latest books in hardback format, though he has recently reverted to publishing some titles in softcover format. That same year, he also published television producer Steve Binder's memoir, '68 At 40: Retrospective, of producing the Singer Presents Elvis television special. This television special is commonly referred to as the '68 Comeback Special. Later, '68 At 40: Retrospective was reprinted in soft-cover format as well.  Elvis Sessions: The Recorded Music of Elvis Aron Presley 1953-1977  In 1993, Tunzi self-published the first edition in a series of books titled Elvis Sessions: The Recorded Music of Elvis Aron Presley 1953-1977 based on Elvis Presley's recording sessions / live recordings. Two further volumes followed in 1996 and 2004. These books have documented the musicians and backup vocalists who performed with Presley as well as some unreleased recordings. Booklist wrote of Tunzi's first Elvis Sessions book, \\"Elvis Sessions encompasses the King's musical career from his first commercial sides for Sun Records in 1954 through his final concert recordings in June, 1977, two months before his death. This terrain is traversed in Reconsider Baby: The Definitive Elvis Sessionography (rev. ed. 1986) but Tunzi also includes material that surfaced recently.\\" American Libraries wrote of Tunzi's first edition of Elvis Sessions, \\"The genuine musical genius of Elvis Presley, has, to a large degree, been obscured by the tragic excesses of his last years and the seemingly inexhaustible supply of tabloid drivel about him. Elvis Sessions: The Recorded Music of Elvis Aron Presley 1953-1977 eschews such nonsense and sticks with the facts about Elvis's recording career, resulting in a solid bit of American pop music history.\\" American Libraries, American Library Association, September, 1993, Unknown Author, Page 718, The Source One of the unreleased recordings by Presley that Tunzi documented in Elvis Sessions II: The Recorded Music of Elvis Aron Presley 1953-1977 was an acetate recording he personally owned of A Little Less Conversation originally thought to have been made in June 1968 during the production of the \\"Singer Presents...ELVIS\\" NBC television special.Elvis Sessions II: The Recorded Music of Elvis Aron Presley 1953-1977, JAT Publishing, 1996, , Joseph A. Tunzi, Introduction by Al Pachucki, Pages 139 and 399 However, it has since been determined that this acetate recording was actually an alternate take made in March, 1968 during the soundtrack recording sessions for the 1968 Metro- Goldwyn-Mayer motion picture, Live a Little, Love a Little. A backing track of A Little Less Conversation from the Live a Little, Love a Little recording sessions was submitted for the 1968 \\"Singer Presents Elvis\\" television special but ultimately was not used, which lead to some of the confusion regarding the date of the acetate recording. In the mid-nineties, Tunzi sold to Bertelsmann Music Group (now owned by Sony Music) the unreleased recording that first appeared on the 1998 double album Memories: The '68 Comeback Special and was later used in the 2001 Warner Brothers motion picture Ocean's Eleven (2001 film) and ultimately remixed by DJ Junkie XL. This remix became a worldwide number one hit, part of a marketing campaign for Nike, Inc.'s \\"Secret Tournament\\" Scorpion KO during the 2002 World Cup and a bonus track on the chart-topping compilation ELV1S 30 #1 Hits. Opdyke also wrote of Tunzi's first two volumes, \\"Tunzi's 1993 \\"sessions\\" book first came out through mail order only. Recently it appeared in a revised edition (412 pages) that quickly became even more useful than the first. There were many great photos along with endless appendices covering gold and platinum records, concert lists, and even a limited bootleg section.\\"The Printed Elvis: The Complete Guide To Books About The King, Greenwood Press, 1999, , Steven Opdyke, Pages 160-161 In November, 2016 Jeremy Roberts wrote an article detailing Elvis' connection to guitarist and entertainer Glen Campbell and the fact that Campbell has been erroneously cited for several years as having played guitar on the recording sessions that produced the title song, \\"Viva Las Vegas (song)\\" of Presley's 1964 film. However, the article points out that after contacting Tunzi, it is clear that Campbell played on Elvis' cover recording of Ray Charles' What'd I Say which was also featured in the film.https://medium.com/@jeremylr/setting- the-record-straight-on-elvis-presley-and-glen-campbells-recording- summit-c1bf3d03ddb3#.eqoin77tw Tunzi has also written and published Elvis No. 1 - The Complete Chart History Of Elvis Presley, which details Elvis Presley's chart numbers on the various charts in both Billboard (magazine) and Cashbox (magazine). A fourth volume of Elvis Sessions is currently being worked on. Television, Compact Disc and DVD releases In 1997, Tunzi was part of an Elvis Presley twentieth anniversary Blockbuster Video television commercial which featured photographs from his own photo agency. In one of the rare occasions, Tunzi was physically credited for photo usage in the television commercial. This commercial promoted an exclusive Elvis Presley compact disc being sold at Blockbuster Video. Over the years, his company, JAT Publishing, has expanded to produce several compact disc and DVD titles. He has also written and published three projects featuring the Beatles. These projects included a book titled Beatles '65 which featured the only four known candid color paparazzi photographs taken of Elvis Presley and the members of the Beatles on August 27, 1965. Ken Sharp wrote a column piece titled Rock Report in Friday Morning Quarterback of Tunzi's Beatles '65 that \\"the 96-page book draws together exciting and dramatic photographs of the Beatles in concert and at press conferences. Photographs of fans at shows, experiencing the complete electrical shock of \\"Beatlemania\\" is also included.\\"Friday Morning QB, Rock Report, Terry Marshall, Ken Sharp, August, 2002 Included with this project was Elvis Sings Beatles Songs, the first officially sanctioned compact disc release to feature all of Elvis Presley's cover recordings of songs written and originally recorded by the Beatles. Derek Page wrote a review of Tunzi's Beatles '65 in Beatlefan magazine in which he ended his review by saying that Beatles '65 was \\"all in all, a marvelous look at The Beatles in their touring prime.\\"Beatlefan magazine, The Goody Press, Executive Editor Al Sussman, Derek Page, Issue #137 (Vol. 23, No. 5), July / August, 2002, The second project Tunzi did on the Beatles was Beatles '64: Goin' To Kansas City which was simply a smaller photo booklet accompanying a CD featuring the audio of a previously unreleased Beatles press conference on September 17, 1964. The third project featuring the Beatles was the book titled 1964: The Year That...Changed America & Me. This book featured black & white photographs of The Beatles arrival in the United States of America on February 7, 1964, black and white and color photographs of the Beatles rehearsing and performing during their first three appearances on The Ed Sullivan Show, black and white and color photographs of the group meeting boxer Cassius Clay, later known as Muhammad Ali, while he was in Miami, Florida training for his February 25, 1964 bout with Sonny Liston, and lastly black and white photographs of the band at a press conference as well as during a concert that took place in Dallas, Texas on September 18, 1964. In 1999, Eclipse Music Group released the first Elvis shaped compact disc, titled Elvis Presley Limited Edition Shaped CD. Tunzi provided the liner notes for this release.https://www.allmusic.com/album/release/elvis-shaped-cd-box- mr0002640563/credits Tunzi produced a DVD starring Elvis Presley and Frank Sinatra in 2000, titled Welcome Home Elvis and in 2001 started a series of DVD videos titled Hot Shots & Cool Clips, which is presently at eight volumes. The Welcome Home Elvis release was one of the first independent Elvis Presley video releases on the DVD format. The Hot Shots & Cool Clips series has featured newsreel, press conference, concert and candid footage of Elvis Presley throughout his career. The website elvisondvdcd.de stated when discussing the third volume in the Hot Shots & Cool Clips series that \\"Joe Tunzi today is one of a very select group of people who go through obscure archives, searching high and low for undiscovered, rare footage. What he turns up with simply is breathtaking each and every time. On this volume he has collected some of the most rarest footage ever.\\"http://elvisondvdcd.de/elvis- presley-hot-shots-and-cool-clips1--7.html Tunzi also produced a DVD titled Young Man of The Nation on Elvis Presley being bestowed as one of the Ten Outstanding Young Men In America in 1970 by the United States Junior Chamber of Congress (Jaycees). The name of the award was later changed to the Ten Outstanding Young Americans. In 2001, Tunzi released a compact disc titled Elvis, America The Beautiful, as part of a book package featuring a book of the same name. This set was also sold through Time-Life. Although the set was conceived prior to the September 11 attacks in the United States, the sales of this book / CD combination spiked in the aftermath of that tragic event as several thousand sets were sold. In 2007, Tunzi collaborated with Sony / BMG on the budget CD title Country's Golden Hits, a ten track title featuring musical selections from the likes of Mac Davis, Sonny James, Kris Kristofferson, Johnny Cash, The Oak Ridge Boys, Floyd Cramer, Tammy Wynette, Waylon Jennings, Dolly Parton and Charlie Rich.https://www.amazon.com/Countrys-Golden-Hits-Various/dp/B000P1KROI Initially Tunzi sold this compact disc through his own website but later on it was sold through other outlets including Tuesday Morning. Most of the songs featured on this compact disc were songs that Elvis Presley had considered recording at some point. Research In August, 2002, Tunzi was one of the first to properly document and correct the erroneous photo credits attributed to the cover of Elvis Presley's first self-titled RCA Records vinyl album.Tampa Tribune, Steven M. Weaver, August 16, 2002, Greg Williams, Bay Life Section Pages 1, 6 Forever Elvis In Tampa https://www.nme.com/photos/50-iconic-indie-album-covers-the-fascinating- stories-behind-the-sleeves/376825#27 The album, Elvis Presley (album) only originally credited the photographs used to photographer William Popsie Randolph. However, this credit line actually only applied to the photographs used on the back cover. The series of four photos found on the back cover were taken in New York at RCA on December 1, 1955. The front cover, an iconic picture of Elvis Presley performing in concert at the Fort Homer W. Hesterly Armory in Tampa, Florida on July 31, 1955 was actually photographed by William V. \\"Red\\" Robertson of Robertson & Fresch. Tunzi was quoted in the Tampa Tribune newspaper as saying, \\"Forget about Popsie. Popsie did not take that photo.\\"Tampa Tribune, Steven M. Weaver, August 16, 2002, Greg Wiliams, Bay Life Section Pages 1, 6  Photograph Archives and Licensing  Photographs from Tunzi's archives have appeared in numerous compact disc and vinyl reissues of Presley's music beginning with the 1994 compact disc reissues of Elvis (1973 album) and Raised on Rock.

The school is located on the Mahidol Salaya campus twenty-five kilometers west of Bangkok, Thailand. The MUIDS curriculum is a synthesis of the Content Standards for California Public Schools and the Thailand Ministry of Education Content Standards for Basic Education. MUIDS graduates study at Thai, Thai international, and international universities. MUIDS is certified by W.A.S.C. (Western Association of Schools and Colleges) as well as the Thai Ministry of Education.  History  In 2008, Mahidol University conducted a study to determine the possibility of creating an international demonstration school as a feeder school for the university. In 2010, the university assembled a board of directors who lead the creation of MUIDS. The school officially opened in the fall of 2013Thai Government Announces Creation of MUIDS and graduated its first senior class in the summer of 2016.  Curriculum  The core curriculum (math, science, English, social studies, etc.) at MUIDS is supported by coursework in required electives (technology, physical education, fine arts) and career-based electives (business, medicine, etc.). Advanced Placement (AP) courses are also available for students. The Thai Ministry of Education mandates that all students take Thai Language and Civics courses. Native and non-native speakers take separate classes. Some faculties in Thai universities require significantly more math and science credits than international universities. MUIDS counselors help students navigate this complex process. The school combines the Thai Ministry of Education and American Common Core Standards. Students are required to earn twenty community service hours per year as well as one hundred learner development hours through clubs and activities. They may choose from several electives such as Intro to Software Engineering, Zoology, and even Entrepreneurship.  School year  The MUIDS school year begins in August and ends in June. It consists of one hundred and eighty school days stretched across four quarters. The school observes Thai and Buddhist holidays as well as certain Western holidays. The academic program is organized on a period schedule. Classes are year-long; each period meets anywhere from one to five times a week. MUIDS students earn a minimum of 81 credits over a three-year period. They must earn at least 27 credits every school year. At the end of the school year students and teachers participate in ‚ÄúWeek Without Walls,‚Äù spending a week of school outside of the classroom learning in a non- conventional environment. This one-week trip always takes place outside the city of Bangkok.  Extracurricular activities  The student activities program is designed to complement and enrich the academic program as well as provide avenues for further development. More than thirty after school activities and clubs are available for students. Among them are Model United Nations, Junior Achievement, and Yearbook. MUIDS sports teams compete with other schools throughout Thailand. Thai students can also join ROTC.  Faculty  67 faculty members work at MUIDS. Roughly one third are Thai nationals, one third are Americans, and around ten percent are British. Remaining teachers come from Bangladesh, India, the Netherlands, the Philippines, and Canada. Over a third hold master's degrees.  Student body  664 students currently attend MUIDS of which the majority are Thai. Just over 80% of them live in the greater Bangkok area, while the remaining Thai students come from other Thai provinces. Non-Thai students are Japanese, Kuwaitis, Taiwanese, Chinese, Bahraini, Vietnamese, and Korean.

It connects the provincial capital Haikou on the island's north coast with Sanya, the major city on Hainan's south coast. The rail line is 363.8 km long; its terminals are Haikou railway station and Sanya railway station. Cargo trains enter this railway from Zhanjiang, Guangdong at the South Port of the Guangdong‚ÄìHainan Railway. The Hainan western ring railway has a long history, some of its sections dating to World War II. It has achieved its present form upon the completion of a major expansion and upgrade project in 2005. After that, the Hainan western ring railway (including a few minor side branches) remained the island's only railway until the opening of the Hainan eastern ring high-speed railway in 2010, which connects to the western ring at its both end points. As of 2019, the Hainan western ring railway is primarily used for freight, and has only very limited passenger service. The new Hainan Western Ring High- Speed Railway, primarily for passenger service, has been constructed along a fairly similar, but slightly shorter (344 km) route. History The Hainan western ring railway has a complicated history. The first railways on Hainan, which were later incorporated in the Hainan western ring railway, were constructed during the Japanese occupation of the island during WWII. One of these lines connected the iron ore mine at Shilu with the Basuo Harbor on the island's west coast. The 53-km line was built in 1940-1942 to the Japanese gauge, using the labor of some 50,000 Chinese workers. It was opened in the spring of 1942, but largely destroyed by a typhoon the same summer. Rebuilt in a more capital way, it reopened in May 1943. Another line constructed during the Japanese occupation ran along the island's southwestern coast, from Basuo to the Anyou port facilities () in Sanya, via Huangliu and Lingtou (). This line was opened in March 1943. After the Communists took over Hainan in April 1950, the narrow-gauge railways weren't used anymore, as they had been damaged beyond repair. The Shilu-Basuo line was rehabilitated in 1956-57, and converted to China's standard gauge in 1971. Two sections of the former Anyou- Basuo line were rebuilt as well: the 108-km-long Anyou-Huangliu section was rebuilt, on standard gauge, in 1958-59, the 18-km Huangliu-Lingtou section was restored in 1960. Together these two sections formed the Anyou-Lingtou line, opened on January 1, 1961. However, in 1965 the Huangliu-Lingtou section was closed again, because its main customer, the Jianfengling forestry enterprise (), stopped shipping timber by rail. In 1984-85, the Huangliu-Lingtou section, as well as the long-abandoned Lingtou-Basuo section, were restored, thus creating the standard-gauge Hainan western ring railway from Shilu (Changjiang county seat) to Anyou (in Sanya). In 2004, the railway from Haikou to Chahe Station (on the Basuo-Shilu line, near Shilu) was completed, making the short Chahe-Shilu section into a secondary dead-end branch. This finally gave the Hainan western ring railway its modern configuration, from Haikou to Sanya. In the same year (2004), the Guangdong-Hainan Rail Ferry started operating, integrating the Hainan western ring railway into China's national railway network. The ferry's Hainan terminal is adjacent to Haikou railway station (which in fact is located quite a ways west of Haikou city proper). In 2006-2007 the railway way thoroughly upgraded. In many places it was rerouted in order to reduce the maximum incline to 1% increase the minimum curve radius to 800‚Äì1600 m. This also straightened the railway, reducing its total length by 27 km. Now it is capable of running freight trains up to 10,000 tons in weight, and support (passenger) trains' speeds up to 120‚Äì160 km/h (depending on the section). Provisions were made to make it possible to electrify the railway in the future. In 2007, the reopened railway started receiving passenger trains from China's mainland; after crossing from Guangdong to Haikou on the ferry, they would continue along the entire length of the Hainan western ring to Sanya. As of 2012, however, most of the trains from the mainland terminate in Haikou, where the passengers can transfer to the new Hainan eastern ring high-speed railway. Now only one passenger train (Z201/Z202 from Beijing West) continues along the western ring to Sanya, with a stop in Dongfang (Basuo). ‰∏â‰∫öÂàóËΩ¶Êó∂ÂàªË°® (Sanya schedule) Notes External links Category:Railway lines in China Category:Railway lines opened in 2004 Category:Standard gauge railways in China Category:Transport in Hainan Category:3 ft 6 in gauge railways in China ","title":"Hainan western ring railway"},{"id":"37963297","text":"Tulsiberia More, 2012 Kulgachia is a small town Panchayet of Howrah district in the state West Bengal, India.

The episode, written by Jessica Sharzer and directed by Michael Lehmann, originally aired on January 2, 2013. The episode is named for the 1964 song \\"The Name Game\\" which is performed by the cast in the episode. The cast version of \\"The Name Game\\" was available for purchase through iTunes. This episode is rated TV-MA (LSV). In the episode, Dr. Arden (James Cromwell) puts an end to his experiments; Kit (Evan Peters) and Lana (Sarah Paulson) continue to pressure the killer Dr. Thredson (Zachary Quinto), who reveals several secrets to Kit; now a patient and known by her common name, Judy Martin, Sister Jude (Jessica Lange) gets subjected to the asylum's inhumane treatments; and Monsignor Howard (Joseph Fiennes) takes the fight to the possessed Sister Mary Eunice (Lily Rabe). Plot Dr. Arden revives Kit. Arden, who has placed Grace in his laboratory, lies to Kit that the aliens did not visit. Pepper was also taken by the aliens and has been assigned to protect Grace, and has been made more intelligent by them. After Monsignor Timothy Howard is injured from being crucified has been told by Shachath that he must help her force the Devil out of Sister Mary Eunice, but he must keep his thoughts of doing so hidden from the nun. During a room check, Judy acts rebellious to Mary Eunice and is taken to Arden for electroconvulsive therapy. Arden allows Mary Eunice to work the controls; she sets them past his requested amount and turns on the machine, seriously inhibiting Jude's mental capacity. While Mary Eunice changes Timothy's bandages, he attempts to perform an exorcism. Mary Eunice then rapes him. Timothy says to Jude she was correct about Mary Eunice being possessed. She tells him to kill Mary Eunice, who later admits of knowing his plan to cast out the Devil. He is able to draw out the human part of Mary Eunice, who wishes she could die. He throws her from the top of the stairs. Shachath comes to claim both Sister Mary Eunice and the Devil. Dr. Thredson finds Pepper monitoring Grace, who is almost ready to deliver the baby. Thredson later takes Kit to an office, where Grace is holding her newborn baby. Grace confirms that the baby is Kit's. Thredson goes to where Kit hid the recording of Thredson's confession, but cannot find it. Lana tells him only she knows where the tape is now, threatening to turn it over to the police should anything happen to Kit or anyone else. Judy asks Mother Superior Claudia to get Lana out of the asylum. Timothy performs last rites on Mary Eunice, with Arden attending. Arden requests she is cremated. Alone, Arden later prepares the furnace for the cremation. He climbs on top of Mary Eunice's body as she enters the furnace, and starts the conveyor to immolate himself. Production \\"The Name Game\\" was written by co-executive producer Jessica Sharzer and directed by Bored to Death veteran Michael Lehmann. In a January 2013 interview with Entertainment Weekly, series creator Ryan Murphy spoke about the titular dance scene and the allusion to his other series Glee, \\"I never thought about Glee when we were doing it. The fun of it, I think, is that you're in Sister Jude's shock therapy-induced fantasy. The idea was to really do a musical number that was something very '60s crossed with Jacob's Ladder because it was in her head and it was sort of the beginning of her descent.\\" Murphy also commented on the final scene and Dr. Arden immolating himself, \\"Our version of that character was his whole life was someone who really thought he was not capable of love and to do all the inhuman acts that he did, he had hardened himself. I think when he felt that part of his heart open up and to have it close again was devastating. I also think the image of a Nazi doctor going into an oven is sort of a brilliant metaphor of him literally paying. Obviously, he's a terrible character but I thought his end was very justified and somewhat poetic.\\" Lily Rabe commented on expecting the death of her character Sister Mary Eunice, \\"It's sort of part of being on this show is you know sort of toward the end of this season there's a high likelihood that's gonna happen. Then I did know when that was going to happen as things moved along. It wasn't toward later I knew when and how because it wasn't all known early on.\\" She also spoke about doing her own stunts for the death scene, \\"I did them all! I worked with this incredible stunt double on a couple of things and she was able to work on this job. I had never done wires before. She did some incredible stuff too but I was able to do the whole thing. I was able to do the throw and the fall...I love that stuff. So it's scary to me in the way I love to be scared. I have a little bit of a thrill- seeker in me.\\" About her work on the series, Rabe said, \\"That twisted art sense of humor is right up my alley. I think both seasons of the show have had a lot of laughs ‚Äì I know it might not be that way with everybody. I did have a lot of fun with that. Being so cruel to people, it's similarly painful to Nora [from the first season] where I was suffering from so much heartbreak and loss and pain. It's a different kind of pain where you are literally the Devil. You just sort of lose your soul and detach. But that's also really fun so there's no complaining about going through that kind of pain because it's what gets me out of the bed in the morning, to play parts like that. I even got to sing and dance! I couldn't believe my luck! I felt very very lucky and in love with the part and I got to do so many different things.\\" Reception \\"The Name Game\\" was watched by 2.21 million viewers and received an adult 18-49 rating of 1.2, down slightly from the previously aired episode. Rotten Tomatoes reports a 100% approval rating, based on 17 reviews. The critical consensus reads, \\"The action-filled \\"The Name Game\\" raises questions, offers closure to a couple of wicked characters, and climaxes with a shocking scene.\\" Matt Fowler of IGN thought \\"The Name Game\\" was \\"jarringly good\\", adding that the episode \\"despite its dalliance with a Glee-inspired dance-macabre number, gave us some big game-changing deaths. It heaped a ton of woe onto Jude and Timothy, giving them both powerful ways to atone for their past misdeeds.\\" Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club called the episode \\"a strong return for the show...one of the show's less crazy outings.\\" She called the titular musical sequence \\"one of the most deliriously wonderful things I've seen in a long, long time.\\" References External links * * \\"The Name Game\\" at TV Guide.com Category:2013 American television episodes Name Game, The ","title":"The Name Game (American Horror Story)"},{"id":"37963346","text":"Yellowjacket is the name of several fictional characters appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.

Setting Hogup Cave is located on the southwestern flank of Hogup Mountain in the Great Salt Lake Desert. The Great Salt Lake itself lies ten miles east of the cave.Aikens 1970, p. 1 Hogup Mountain consists of three biotic zones determined by soil, altitude, and moisture. The lowest zone, known as the pickleweed-salt grass community, is a narrow band where sheep herders have excavated several wells, revealing the presence of groundwater. The presence of a deep spring suggests that this zone may have been used as a water source for the cave occupants. The dominant coverage of the entire Hogup Mountain is the sagebrush-shadscale belt which is the next zone. The top zone, the juniper zone, occurs only at the mountain's highest elevations. The highest point of Hogup Mountain is at 6847 ft. Introduction C. Melvin Aikens, professor emeritus at the University of Oregon,C. Melvin Aikens led the excavations in Hogup Cave during two field seasons: June 26 - August 15, 1967, and June 15 - August 20, 1968. According to Aikens, the main purposes of the excavations were to provide data for the study of changing patterns of cultural ecology over time, and to contribute to the solution of several problems of cultural history in the Great Salt Lake region.Aikens 1970, p. 187 Over 8,000 years of accumulated deposits from repeated human occupation were found, dating from 6400 B.C. to A.D. 1850. An archaeological monograph was published in 1970 by Aikens entitled Hogup Cave, containing a detailed analysis of nearly 10,000 artifacts recovered during the two excavations. Numerous bones, wood, hide, cordage, fibers, textile items, chipped stones, clay, pottery, coprolites, hair, feathers, and fur were analyzed. Stratigraphy Trench excavations of the east and west walls of the cave revealed 16 major sequential stratigraphic layers. Aikens noted that the stratigraphy revealed the modifications done by the purposeful movements of the cave occupants.Aikens 1970, p. 14 He also provided detailed descriptions of the individual strata.Aikens 1970, p. 23-25 Stratum 1 Continuous over all squares excavated and laying directly on bedrock, it ranged between 1 and 3 inches thick vertically. It had a composition of light yellow crumbly dust with rotted vegetal matter. A powdered charcoal lens of about 6 to 8 inches in diameter was found on the surface of the layer near the north end of the excavation. Stratum 2 Only found in a small area against the east wall and in a low spot along the western boundary of excavation, it ranged between 4 and 6 inches thick. Composed of dark brown crumbly earth arising from decomposed vegetal matter, there were no cultural features found in this stratum. Stratum 3 Continuous over all squares and ranging between 6 and 10 inches, it had a gross composition of a thoroughly burned bed of white ash containing charcoal lenses. However, the east wall and western boundary of the excavation layer were not entirely burned. There were no cultural features found in this stratum. Stratum 4 Extended over all squares, ranging from 9 to 18 inches in thickness, and composed of pickleweed chaff, twigs, shredded bark, and antelope hair. A small bowl-shaped pit 8 inches deep and 17 inches in diameter was found near the eastern edge of the excavation, filled with ash and charcoal, suggesting it was used as a fire pit. Stratum 5 Extended over all squares excavated and ranging between 8 and 14 inches thick. It was composed of pickleweed chaff, twigs, shredded bark, dust, and antelope hair. A large amount of human fecal matter, a charcoal-ash lens, and a 6 to 8 inch thick bed of woody twigs were found. Professor Aikens concluded that this was a special use area. Stratum 6 Extended over all squares excavated and ranged between 6 and 13 inches thick. It had a composition of pickleweed chaff, grass, twigs, and dust. The center of the excavation contained abundant guano where bats still congregate. There were no cultural features found in this stratum. Stratum 7 Found only over the front of the cave and ranging between 12 and 18 inches thick, it was composed of pickleweed chaff, grass, and dust. Abundant guano was found under the cleft in the cave ceiling and two small circular charcoal lenses were found near the center of the excavation. Stratum 8 Extended over all squares excavated, ranging between 9 and 36 inches thick, it had a composition of pickleweed chaff, grass, twigs, and dust. Concentrated guano was found near the center of the excavation. A solidified burned area of charcoal and ash and two ash-charcoal lenses were also found. Stratum 9 Extended over all squares excavated and ranged between 6 and 18 inches thick. It had a gross composition of pickleweed chaff, grass, twigs, bat guano, and dust. Guano was the dominant layer near the center of the excavation and small rock spalls were found toward the east wall. Stratum 10 Extended over all squares excavated and ranging between 9 and 10 inches thick, and having a composition of pickleweed chaff, twigs, roof spalls, and antelope hair. A 6 to 8 inch thick deep ash zone (the result of a fire smoldering out of control) and an ash-charcoal lens were found. Stratum 11 Continuous outside the cave portal and truncated by Stratum 12 inside the cave mouth. Composed of pickleweed chaff, grass, dust, twigs, and antelope hair, a small ash-charcoal lens was found inside the cave portal. Aikens pointed out that although this stratum was not continuous over most of the excavation, it was important because it led to the realization that there was a partial gap in the stratigraphic record. Stratum 12 Continuous over most squares excavated and ranging between 6 and 12 inches thick, it was composed of Scirpus, bark, and antelope hair. A small ash- charcoal lens and an unlined pit of approximately 18 inches were found. Stratum 13 Continuous over the outer chamber of the cave and ranging between 9 and 12 inches thick. It had a composition of pickleweed chaff, and there were no cultural features found in this stratum. Stratum 14 Extended over all squares excavated in the outer room and ranging between 8 and 14 inches thick, this stratum was composed of pickleweed chaff, grass, dust, ash, and antelope hair. Bat guano was also found under the cleft in the cave ceiling. Four ash-charcoal areas were found and black stains remained from incomplete combustion. Two of the burned areas were large, with the largest separated into light grey, dark grey, black, and reddish bands. Aikens inferred that the burned area was a result of accidental in situ burning of the cave fill. Stratum 15 Continuous over all squares excavated in the outer room and ranging between 2 and 7 inches thick. It had a composition of pickleweed chaff, dust, and guano, with no cultural features found. Stratum 16 Continuous over all squares excavated in the outer room and ranging between 3 and 12 inches thick. It had a composition of pickleweed chaff, grass, bark, twigs, Scirpus, antelope hair, and bat guano, and three small charcoal lenses were found. Cultural features Professor Aikens categorized four kinds of cultural features.Aikens 1970, p. 25-26 The first were the hearths found in most levels. In some areas, there was considerable ash and charred material as a result of the in situ burning of deposits, and demonstrating that the burned areas had no distinct margins. The second type was an unlined bowl-shaped pit found in Stratum 4. This pit contained occupational detritus and no evidence of fire. The third was the thin bed of Scirpus, grasses, or twigs. Aikens suggested that this bed might have been used for sleeping or sitting, or that it was the detritus of some particular kind of activity. The fourth type of cultural feature was the modification of the cave fill and the extensive aboriginal movement, which Aikens concluded were performed to level or enlarge the living space in the cave. Professor Aikens also pointed out that cultural constructions were rare in Hogup Cave compared with the total number of deposits found, giving the impression that the occupants had made only the most rudimentary and casual modifications to the cave. Artifacts Pottery Professor Aikens categorized the pottery sherds found in the cave into 6 types: Great Salt Lake Grey, Knolls Grey, Snake Valley Grey, Snake Valley Corrugated, Promontory ware, and Shoshoni ware.Aikens 1970, p. 31-32 The first pottery appeared in Stratum 12, increasing in later strata, and continued to Stratum 16. Aikens explained that the frequency distribution of the pottery suggested concurrent use of the cave by makers of both types of pottery. Clay Figurine fragments were represented by six unfired clay fragments. Three were conical in form and resembled the handle termini, or lower portions, of typical Utah Fremont figurines. The fourth fragment had two ‚Äúears‚Äù at the broad end, the fifth fragment was cylindrical, and the sixth fragment was L-shaped. Also found was a flattened oval shape of unfired clay containing a mixture of crushed white stones and fragments of vegetal fiber. Two flattened lumps of unfired clay with impressions of coiled basketry were found as well.Aikens 1970, p. 32 Chipped stone Professor Aikens categorized a total of 325 complete or nearly complete projectile points that were well known in the Great Basin.Aikens 1970, p. 33-56 He added that only the artifacts recovered from the 1967 excavation were included in his tabulation and discussion as the materials from the 1968 excavation were not yet analyzed when the paper was published. There were 325 projectile points recovered from the cave, classified into 29 types. Besides looking at the features of the projectile points themselves, they were also compared with the collection of 489 complete projectile points from the nearby Danger Cave. After the comparison, Prof. Aikens grouped the collection into four major series: 1) Pinto or Little Lake; 2) lanceolate; 3) Elko; 4) and small projectile points. The groups signified that there was close cultural relationships between the types in the series, therefore they could be seen as four cultural/technological traditions. There were 70 thin and bifacially worked blades, which had no cutting edges nor notches and stems. Choppers were heavier, cruder, and bifacially flaked with cutting edges.Aikens 1970, p. 57-58, 60. 82 coarsely flaked unifaces and bifaces were found, discarded or aborted roughouts or blanks.Aikens 1970, p. 60. 147 scrapers which had one or more flaked chipped edges that created blunt working edges.Aikens 1970, p. 62-63. Only two presented special preparation for hafting. 2 spokeshaves and 21 drills were also found.Aikens 1970, p. 63, 65. The drills looked more like artifacts than the spokeshaves, which seemed to be nondescript notches pieces of stone. The drills were found uniformly in all deposits. Ground stone Professor Aikens described a total of 922 items in this major category, which was broken down further into groups depending on the use of the artifacts. \\"Shaft smoothers\\" were shaped stones which could be distinguished by abraded grooves occurring on one or more surfaces.Aikens 1970, p. 67, 69. 2 complete specimens were analyzed, both made of a pumice material, one was rectangular while the other was subrectangular with rounded edges. On the broadest edge of the second stone, there was a main groove that ran the full length of the edge. 5 specimens classified as \\"grooved stone\\" were found, one complete specimen and four fragments. The complete stone had an irregular shape of a pumice material with three shallow grooves.Aikens 1970, p. 69. 8 nearly complete specimens and 262 fragments were classified as \\"milling stones\\".Aikens 1970, p. 69-70. These specimens were further divided into two categories: block and slab milling stones. One of the two nearly complete block milling stones, made of a quartzite material, was oval in shape with a circular depression, while the other block milling stone had no depression and had a rectangular shape. The six nearly complete slab milling stones were made of mainly mica schist, schist, conglomerate, gneiss, and sandstone. Traces of red and black pigments could be found on the sides and center of two nearly complete sab milling stones respectively. 14 complete specimens and 35 fragments were classified as \\"manos\\",Aikens 1970, p. 70-71. being further divided into 7 subclasses according to their shape, utilization, or grinding on one or more sides. They were made of sandstone, quartzite, vesicular basalt, mica schist, gabbro, granite, slate, schist, and rhyolite porphyry. Subclass 6 consisted of one long, cylindrical mano with three grinding surfaces, one of which was longitudinally and laterally convex, giving it a rocker shape. The other two surfaces were flattened, showing that they had been used for battering. 2 specimens were classification as \\"pestles\\".Aikens 1970, p. 71 Made of gabbro and gneiss, they were long and tapered from broad battered ends to narrow rounded ends. One of the specimens was square and the other loaf-shaped. The loaf-shaped specimen had a surface flattened by grinding and this indicated that it was also used as a mano. Yellow pigment was found on the flat surface. There were 6 \\"pounding/abrading stones\\" found, made of sandstone, gabbro, and conglomerate, all having flat abraded surfaces and battered edges and ends. Traces of red pigment were found on the surface of one of the specimens. 46 thin \\"tabular stones\\" were classified, which were further divided into 5 categories according to the kind and degree of modification of the stones: bifacially worked edges, unifacially worked edges, ground on two surfaces, ground on one surface, and unworked fragments. They were made of schist, shale, and limestone.Aikens 1970, p. 72. There were 30 specimens classified as \\"incised stones\\", where designs had been incised on their surfaces. They were grouped according to their design elements and layout.Aikens 1970, p. 79-84. Most of the stones were either tabular stones or pebbles with markings or designs made by incising or engraving with a sharp instrument. Worked bone, antler, horn and shell There were a total of 269 items in this category, broken down into four sub-categories: awls, pendants, whistles, and sheep horn wrenches. The awls were classified according to the degree of point taper and how the bone fragment was modified. They were made from antelope, sheep, or deer bones.Aikens 1970, p. 85. The pendants were made from canine teeth of wapiti. They were perforated by drilling at the root end. Since there were no wapiti bones found in the cave, this suggested that the animals were killed elsewhere.Aikens 1970, p. 88. A broken bone tube which had a broad, deep notch near the broken end suggested that the specimen might have been used as a whistle.Aikens 1970, p. 90. 2 mountain sheep horns, perforated by a large hole, showed signs of wear on one edge of the hole, indicating the horns were used as shaft wrenches or straighteners.Aikens 1970, p. 91. Hide artifacts There were a total of 719 items in this classification. 23 moccasins were recovered from Hogup Cave, in three categories: Hock moccasins, Fremont moccasins, and Hogup moccasins.Aikens 1970, p. 97-109. The 3 hock moccasins recovered were made from bison hide by removing the hock of an animal through girdling the leg at two points and removing the hide in the form of a skin tube. The tubes were specially cut so that the natural L-shaped angle of the hide served as the heel of the moccasin. 16 Fremont moccasins were made of either deer or antelope skin. According to Aikens, the Fremont moccasins were first described by Morss,Morss 1931, p. 64-65. with the single difference between the moccasins recovered from Hogup Cave and Morss' being no seam at the heel joining the two upper pieces. The moccasins found in the cave had two flaps formed by the heel ends of the uppers that could have been folded over one another at the back of the heel and ankle and held in place by securing the ankle with a long string. 4 moccasins were classified as Hogup moccasins due to their distinct pattern. They were made from a single piece of hide that is folded over the foot and sewn together across the toe. A separate outer sole was added to the basic piece and an ankle wrap was sewn around the upper part to give the moccasin a bootlike appearance. Also recovered from the caves were 2 fur robes, both of which were rectangular in shape, one of which still had fur on the hide while the other had about 40% of the fur retained.Aikens 1970, p. 109. Feathers There were three types of feathers recovered from the caves. 10 feathers had been worked by cutting the barbs and cropped very close to the rachis. The function of these feathers was unknown.Aikens 1970, p. 118 3 flight feathers were worked by wrapping them with thin strips of sinew. One of the specimens had one side of the barbs uncut and the other side cut off evenly. The function of these feathers was also unknown. Finally, a total of 245 unworked feathers were recovered. The good condition of the feathers allowed straightforward visual comparison with known specimens from the Royal Ontario Museum collections. Donald Baldwin described that the grey-crowned rosy finch was the smallest bird and the most heavily represented of any species.Appendix VI, Bladwin, 267-269 Worked plant fibers 46 pads were made of shredded sagebrush and another 3 were made of grass stems,Aikens 1970, p. 119. the fibers were stuck together and matted tightly, suggesting that they might have been impregnated with blood, further suggesting they might have been used as menstrual pads. However, it could not be established that blood was the adhesive agent, so the identification of menstrual pads remains conjectural. Textiles 160 pieces of basketry and specimens were recovered from the 1967-68 excavations.Aikens 1970, p. 133-146 The collections were one of the largest and best preserved from a well-dated Great Basin site. Twined and coiled basketry were identified with subclasses based on the several diagnostic criteria. 8 subclasses were allocated to twined basketry and 7 subclasses were assigned to coiled basketry. When dealing exclusively with Hogup materials, Dr. Adovasio concluded that coiling was earlier than twining in Hogup Cave and more popular. The textile production and use at Hogup Cave were more common and there was a greater variety in technique and form below Stratum 10. Subclass 13 (one-rod and bundle foundation, noninterlocking stitch) gained its popularity through time due to its adaptability.Aikens 1970, p. 151. Artifacts of wood 491 pieces of worked wood and reed were recovered. Most of the finished artifacts were related to the hunt, while the digging sticks represented the gathering aspect of the economy.Aikens 1970, p. 153 A small variety of gaming pieces could infer leisure time or perhaps a nonsecular side of the culture. Fragments of atlatl darts and throwing boards represented the use of atlatl. There was no firm evidence for feathering of mainshafts of the darts,Aikens 1970, p. 154 which consisted of a shallow cup in the proximal end to engage the pointed spur on the distal end. The mainshaft specimens collected were too fragmentary to estimate the length. the throwing boards were also too fragmentary to establish a good estimate of their size or form. The arrows collected were represented by a compound type with a reed mainshaft and a wooden foreshaft.Aikens 1970, p. 160. Dalley concluded that the compound arrow was the most common type found in the cave. A striking change from using atlatl to bow and arrow could be seen when comparing the strata. From strata 1 through 8 there were only atlatl and dart items, whereas strata 12 to 16 contained only bow and arrow items. Strata 9 and 10 contained a mixture of both weapons and there were no occurrences of either type in strata 11.Aikens 1970, p. 168 However, Dalley identified two weaknesses in the interpretation. First, a stratum rather than an artifact was dated and secondly, the inferences were based on few and fragmentary artifacts which some of them had a lack of distinctive characteristics. Summary Four distinct cultural patterns that succeed one another at the cave were identified, named Units I through IV. They were categorized by distinctive artifact types and frequencies, as well as distinctive patterns of plant and animal species distribution. Unit I (6400‚Äì1250 B.C.) The materials from Strata 1 through 8 defined Unit I.Aikens 1970, p. 188-190. Unit I resembled the Desert culture where a way of life was based on seed gathering, primarily pickleweed, and small and large game hunting, mostly pronghorn, deer, and bison. Studies conducted by Fry and Kelso suggested that the tiny seed of the pickleweed was the dominant vegetal food.Appendix III, Fry, p. 247-250Appendix IV, Kelso, p. 251-262 Milling stones were used for seed processing; projectile points, darts, and spears were used for hunting. There were remains of a domestic dog found in Unit I. Haag has suggested that they were a source of food, but not major one as the dog bones were broken and scattered with other food bones.Appendix VIII, Haag, p. 273-274 There were also evidence of intensive occupation of the cave during this period through the abundance and variety of artifacts. Unit II (1250 B.C.‚ÄìA.D. 400) The materials from Strata 9 through 11 defined Unit II. Prof. There was a dramatic cultural shift from Unit I to Unit II, shown from a striking decline in number and variety of artifacts, which might suggest a new pattern of resource use and infrequent visits to the cave.Aikens 1970, p. 190-192 There was also a marked decline in the use of milling stones and manos, which Harper and Alder suggested might be due to the recession of the lake that reduced the suitability for growth of pickleweed.Appendix I, Harper and Alder, p. 215-240 The importance of bison and pronghorn became more emphasized than in Unit I but evidence showed a loss of interest in deer, rabbits, and the total disappearance of waterfowl.Appendix V, Parmalee, p. 263-266. New hunting equipment such as bow and arrow were used as seen from fragments of arrows. Basketry fragments were also found but in low frequency. Aikens suggested that the primary function of basketry was related to collecting and processing of plant seeds and this low usage coincided with the reduced intake of pickleweed. Unit III (A.D. 400‚Äì1350) Strata 12 through 14 were used to define Unit III. Milling stones and manos continued to be low in use during this period.Aikens 1970, p. 192-194. Coprolite analysis suggested a decline in pickleweed seed, and plant macrofossils analysis showed similar results and also indicated that sagebrush became an important source of food. In Cutler's study, shelled maize was found but there were no cobs or husks, suggesting that maize was brought to the site from elsewhere.Appendix VII, Cutler, p. 271-272. In this Unit, Bison overtook pronghorn as the main large game hunting. Numerous small, chipped stone arrowpoints and fragments of arrows were found but no fragments of atlatl were identified. The usage of basketry was similar to Unit II, and the first pottery from the site was identified in Unit III. They were identified as ollas and jars and five of them were referable to the Fremont culture and one of them was Shoshoni ware. Red-painted bone splinters and Fremont style moccasins became common for the first time during this era. Unit IV (A.D. 1350‚Äì1850) The materials recovered from Strata 15 and 16 were used to define Unit IV. There was a marked decline in artifacts and an almost complete disappearance of distinctive objects such as those found in Unit III, which could suggest a radical change of cultural ecology in Utah.Aikens 1970, p. 194-195 The number of milling stones and manos continued to be small and sagebrush and grasses continued to be the main sources of vegetal food. The most important activity remained hunting, and bison and pronghorn were still the most hunted animals. Hide artifacts such as thongs and fragments of rabbit fur robes were found and pottery sherds continued to be seen but few were Fremont, causing Aikens to observe that they were most likely out of context in Unit IV. Conclusion Professor Aikens emphasized in his book that Hogup Cave was only one of the settlements that were occupied during the course of a seasonal round, with the whereabouts of the sometime occupants during the rest of their economic cycle being unknown. Aikens pointed out that his study defined only a part of the total cultural system. Therefore, he proposed that to understand fully the changing systems of cultural ecology, those sites which had other activities had to be found and excavated.

After completing her education in Chittagong and Dhaka, she attended Bethune College in Kolkata. She graduated in philosophy with distinction and became a school teacher. Pritilata joined a revolutionary group headed by Surya Sen. She is known for leading fifteen revolutionaries in the 1932 armed attack on the Pahartali European Club, during which one person was killed and eleven injured. The revolutionaries torched the club and were later caught by the British police. To avoid arrest, Pritilata consumed cyanide and died.  Early life  Matriculation examination certificate of Pritilata Pritilata was born in a middle-class Vaidya (Baidya) family on 5 May 1911 in Dhalghat village in Patiya upazila of Chittagong (now in Bangladesh). Waddedar was a title conferred to an ancestor of the family who originally had the surname Dasgupta. Her father Jagabandhu Waddedar was a clerk in the Chittagong Municipality. Her mother Pratibhamayi Devi was a housewife. The couple had six children‚Äì Madhusduan, Pritilata, Kanaklata, Shantilata, Ashalata and Santosh. Pritilata was nicknamed Rani. Jagabandhu tried to arrange best possible education for their children. He got Pritilata admitted in Dr. Khastagir Government Girls' School of Chittagong. Pritilata was a meritorious student. A teacher in the school, whom students affectionately used called Usha Di, used stories of Rani Lakshmibai to inspire nationalism in her students. Kalpana Datta, a classmate of Pritilata, writes in the biography Chittagong Armoury Raiders‚Äì \\"We had no clear idea in our school days about our future. Then the Rani of Jhansi fired our imagination with her example. Sometimes we used to think of ourselves as fearless...\\". Arts and literature were Pritilata's favourite subjects. She passed out of Dr. Khastagir Government Girls' School in 1928 and in 1929, got admitted to the Eden College, Dhaka. In the Intermediate examinations, she stood first among all students who appeared in that year's examination from the Dhaka Board. As a student in Eden College, she participated in various social activities. She joined the group Sree Sangha, headed by Leela Nag, under the banner Deepali Sangha (Dipali Sangha).  In Calcutta  To pursue higher education, Pritilata went to Calcutta (now Kolkata) and got admitted to the Bethune College. Two years later, she graduated in Philosophy from the college with a distinction. However, her degree was withheld by British authorities at Calcutta University. In 2012, she (and Bina Das) were conferred their certificates of merit posthumously.  As a school teacher  After completing her education in Calcutta, Pritilata returned to Chittagong. In Chittagong, she took up the job of headmistress at a local English medium secondary school called Nandankanan Aparnacharan School.  Revolutionary activities   Joining Surya Sen's revolutionary group  Pritilata decided to join the Indian independence movement. Surya Sen had heard about her and wanted her to join their revolutionary group. On 13 June 1932, Pritilata met Surya Sen and Nirmal Sen in their Dhalghat camp. A contemporary revolutionary, Binod Bihari Chowdhury, objected that they did not allow women to join their group. However, Pritalata was allowed to join the group because the revolutionaries reasoned that women transporting weapons would not attract as much suspicion as men.  Inspiration from Ramkrishna Biswas  Surya Sen and his revolutionary group decided to kill Mr. Craig, Inspector General of Chittagong. Ramakrishna Biswas and Kalipada Chakravarty were assigned for this task. But they mistakenly killed SP of Chandpur and Tarini Mukherjee instead of Craig. Ramakrishna Biswas and Kalipada Chakravarty were arrested on 2 December 1931. After the trial Biswas was ordered to be hanged till death and Chakravarty to be exiled to Cellular Jail. The family and friends lacked the amount of money required to travel to Chittagong to Alipore Jail of Calcutta. Since at that time Pritilata was staying in Kolkata, she was asked to go to Alipore Jail and meet Ramkrishna Biswas.  Activities in Surya Sen's group  Along with the revolutionary group of Surya Sen, Pritilata took part in many raids like attacks on the Telephone & Telegraph offices and the capture of the reserve police line. In the Jalalabad battle, she took the responsibility to supply explosives to the revolutionaries.  Pahartali European Club attack (1932)  The Pahartali European Club (shown here in 2010) was torched by the group of revolutionaries In 1932, Surya Sen planned to attack the Pahartali European Club which had a signboard that read \\"Dogs and Indians not allowed\\". Surya Sen decided to appoint a woman leader for this mission. Kalpana Datta was arrested seven days before the event. Because of this, Pritilata was assigned the leadership of the attack. Pritilata went to Kotowali Sea Side for arms training and made the plan of their attack there. They decided to attack the club on 24 September 1932. The members of the group were given potassium cyanide and were told to swallow it if they were caught. On the day of the attack, Pritilata dressed herself as a Punjabi male. Her associates Kalishankar Dey, Bireshwar Roy, Prafulla Das, Shanti Chakraborty wore dhoti and shirt. Mahendra Chowdhury, Sushil Dey and Panna Sen wore lungi and shirt. They reached the club at around 10:45 PM and launched their attack. There were around 40 people inside the club then. The revolutionaries divided themselves into three separate groups for the attack. In the club, a few police officers who had revolvers started shooting. Pritilata incurred a single bullet wound. According to the police report, in this attack, one woman with a surname of Sullivan died and four men and seven women were injured.  Death  In this place Pritilata committed suicide. Now there is a plaque in her memory An injured Pritilata was trapped by the British police. She swallowed cyanide to avoid getting arrested. The next day, the police found her body and identified her. On searching her dead body, the police found a few leaflets, photograph of Ramkrishna Biswas, bullets, whistle and the draft of their plan of attack. During the post-mortem it was found that the bullet injury was not very serious and that cyanide poisoning was the cause of her death. The chief secretary of Bengal sent a report to British authorities in London. In the report it was written‚Äì  Influence  A bust of Waddedar at Pritilata Waddedar primary school, Chittagong Bangladeshi writer Selina Hossain calls Pritilata an ideal for every woman. A trust named Birkannya Pritilata Trust (Brave lady Pritilata Trust) has been founded in her memory. Pritilata's birthday is celebrated by the trust in different places of Bangladesh and India every year. The trust considers her to be \\"a beacon of light for women\\". The last end of Sahid Abdus Sabur Road to Mukunda Ram Hat of Boalkhali upazila in Chittagong has been named as Pritilata Waddedar Road. In 2012, a bronze sculpture of Pritilata Waddedar was erected in front of the Pahartali Railway School, adjacent to the historical European Club. Waddedar's great-grand-niece is British journalist and activist, Ash Sarkar.

This system consisted of a 16-foot, dish-shaped antenna mounted on a movable platform and capable of bouncing a 10,000 watt microwave signal off a particular spot on the moon and down either to the receiving station at the National Security Agency, Fort Meade, Maryland, or to one of the other Navy SIGINT ships. TRSSCOMM had the advantage of being able to transmit large quantities of intelligence information very rapidly without giving away the ship's location to hostile direction-finding equipment or interfering with incoming signals. Its major disadvantage is that it could only work if the moon was visible and the shipboard hydraulic stabilization system worked properly. This system was replaced by creation of a network of artificial military satellites.

He is a four- time Olympian, and a six-time medalist at the European Championships. De√°k- B√°rdos had also won a total of five silver medals at the World Championships, losing out to numerous top-level wrestlers including Alexander Karelin, Rulon Gardner, Khasan Baroyev, and Mija√≠n L√≥pez, all of whom were Olympic champions in the same division. Wrestling career Born in Miskolc De√°k-B√°rdos emerged as one of Hungary's most prominent wrestlers in its sporting history. He first competed at the 1993 European Youth Wrestling Championships in G√∂tzis, Austria, where he finished in fourth place, for the 110 kg division. In 1997, De√°k-B√°rdos achieved his earliest success in wrestling, when he won the silver medal against three-time Olympic champion Alexander Karelin at the World Championships in Wroc≈Çaw, Poland. After Karelin's retirement in 2000, De√°k- B√°rdos continued to build success in wrestling by capturing four medals for the super heavyweight division (120‚Äì130 kg) at the European Championships, including his first ever gold from Moscow. He managed to repeat his silver medal streak at the World Championships, when he lost the final match to United States' Rulon Gardner (2001) and Dremiel Byers (2002), and to Russia's Khasan Baroyev (2003), who succeeded Karelin to become an Olympic champion in 2004. Between 2005 and 2007, De√°k-B√°rdos, however, suffered numerous setbacks in his sporting career. He lost for the fourth time to Cuba's Mija√≠n L√≥pez at the 2005 World Wrestling Championships, coincidentally in his home city, and placed farther from the medal podium at the European Championships. In 2008, De√°k-B√°rdos recaptured his success in super heavyweight wrestling, after winning the silver medal for his team at the World Wrestling Cup in Szombathely. He also added two bronze medals at the European Championships in Vilnius and in Dortmund. Olympic games In addition to his numerous achievements at both the World and European championships, De√°k-B√°rdos became the first Hungarian wrestler to compete in four consecutive Olympic games since Imre Poly√°k did so in 1964. He made his official debut at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, where he competed in the men's 130 kg class. He placed second in the preliminary pool against Bulgarian wrestler and 1996 Olympic bronze medalist Sergei Mureiko and Russia's Alexander Karelin, who previously defeated him at the World Championships three years before, finishing overall in eleventh position. After Karelin's retirement from his fourth Olympics, De√°k-B√°rdos' medal chances became more open by qualifying for the 120 kg class at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. Once again, he repeated his position in the preliminary pool this time, against Finland's four-time Olympian Juha Ahokas and Iran's Sajjad Barzi, who eventually lost to defending Olympic champion Rulon Gardner in the bronze medal bout. At the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, De√°k-B√°rdos reached the second preliminary round of the 120 kg class, by easily defeating Canadian wrestler Ari Taub, with a score of 6‚Äì2. He lost to France's Yannick Szczepaniak, who was able to score one technical point each in the second par terre during the first and final period of the match. De√°k-B√°rdos qualified again for the super heavyweight division at his fourth Olympics in London, after placing fifth from the 2011 World Wrestling Championships in Istanbul, Turkey. He first defeated China's Liu Deli in the qualifying round, before losing out his next match to Sweden's Johan Eur√©n, who eventually won the bronze medal in this event.

This organization was initially created to ensure the rights of patients from leper colonies due to their isolation, and today it is one of the most successful Brazilian social movements, with representation in the National Health Council. The group has used several methods to disseminate information about leprosy including, but not limited to, handing out pamphlets, hosting seminars, and organizing puppet shows for children. Morhan also creates its own publications as a means of mobilization and news regarding leprosy. Furthermore, Morhan has worked with anthropologists to provide explanatory models and lay explanations of leprosy within the Brazilian context. Morhan's work has been exemplary in creating partnerships between social groups and the government and received an award from the United Nation‚Äôs Millennium Development Goals. The current National Coordinator is Artur Custodio Moreira de Souza. Mission Morhan's primary mission is to make people in society understand that leprosy is a curable diseases and to eliminate discrimination and stigma surrounding leprosy. Vision Morhan's vision is to continue to be an informational resource about leprosy, to support those afflicted with leprosy in Brazil, and to be a reference on treatment and human rights. Objectives Morhan has statutory objectives, which include but are not limited to: * Work towards the elimination of leprosy * Assist in healing, rehabilitation and social reintegration of persons who contracted leprosy * Advocate for people affected by leprosy to not suffer restrictions in their social life (job, family, church, school ...) * Contribute to conquer the leprosy stigma and help patients exercise full citizenship * Ensure housing, care, and support to people with leprosy in the time of compulsory isolation (30‚Äì60 days) History Morhan was established on June 6, 1981, by eight people in S√£o Paulo, Brazil, whom had met through extensive research on leprosy or having lived in centers for people afflicted with leprosy. Morhan first emerged as an organization for the physically handicapped in general, although a specific group for those disabled by Hansen‚Äôs disease or leprosy was set up soon afterwards. Support was mobilized mainly among former patients, or those still living in leper colony hospitals. Morhan shattered the stigmatized image of a movement in search of charity by adopting an approach to defend the rights of citizens. Morhan‚Äôs participation in Hansen‚Äôs disease control policymaking was made official nationwide in 1986, influencing the make-up of state technical commissions and municipal health councils. Founders Francisco Augusto Vieira Nunes, or as he was affectionately named Bacurau, was one of the primary leaders in establishing Morhan in 1981. Bacurau contracted leprosy at the age of 5 in the 1940s and he was sent to live in a leper colony for most of his adolescence. Bacurau was Morhan's first National Coordinator. Thomas Frist, a North American social scientist who, at the end of the 1970s and the start of the 1980s, set up a project involving patients from the communities surrounding the old leper colony hospitals was also one of the founders of Morhan. Another founder Cristiano Torres, who spent time in prevention centers and leper colony hospitals since his childhood was a leading figure in the process to resocialize patients from the Marituba Colony in Bel√©m, Par√°. He is the regional coordinator in his state and has been a member of the Morhan board. Celebrity involvement Celebrity involvement in Morhan‚Äôs mission, vision, and objectives has been an integral part of disseminating awareness of leprosy in Brazil. In 1988, Pel√©, the retired soccer player, lent his name to the cause, although he is no longer involved. In 1999, Morhan began working on leprosy education with Rosinha Garotinho, who was married to Rio de Janeiro's governor at the time. In 2002, Ney Matogrosso, a Brazilian singer, guest-starred on one of the most popular novelas (soap opera miniseries) in Brazilian history, The Clone, and the novela writer Gloria Perez incorporated a segment on leprosy into the script. Matogrosso‚Äôs support was not only to strengthen Morhan's brand, but also to step up political pressure to prioritize public campaigns on the disease in Brazil. Novela actress Solange Couto, who also starred in The Clone, subsequently became involved with Morhan as well. Although there has been celebrity involvement, Morhan has yet to find a celebrity who has been afflicted with leprosy to do advocacy work. Locations The movement‚Äôs regional centers include practically all of Brazil‚Äôs states and most of the leading municipalities. Currently, Morhan is present in nearly 100 communities distributed in 24 of the 27 states of the federation, and has about 3,500 volunteers. Morhan is structured with a National Coordinator and State Coordinators. Present in all Brazilian states are multiple cores and sub- cores, all assembled with volunteers. A few cores have international support Savior (Italy), the four cores of Cear√° (England), and Teresina (Netherlands). The rest of the cores, try to get local donations and do fundraisers. Morhan's national entity has an agreement with the state government of Rio de Janeiro, the Novartis Foundation and is negotiating with the Ministry of Health to ensure funding. The national headquarters are located at Rua do Matoso N¬∫ 6, sala 204 - Pra√ßa da Bandeira - Rio de Janeiro, RJ 20270-130, Brasil. Publications One of Morhan‚Äôs primary pursuits is to remain in open dialogue with society about issues surrounding leprosy and its stigma. One of the ways the non-profit converses with society is through publications, which can be found on Morhan‚Äôs website. The Morhan newspaper, which has been published bi-monthly since 1982, hosts information, support, and reception of complains. Special release publications bring together the results of the National Workshop on Comprehensive Leprosy Care. The special release publications highlights how Morhan, through volunteers, the board and its National Technical Assistance, present a set of demands and proposals to the Ministry of Health, the National Health Council, and the Secretaries of State for Health. Furthermore, Morhan has been concerned with statistics disseminated by major public health institutions. Today, Morhan disseminates this information as an instrument to empower society with statistics and facts about leprosy. Morhan‚Äôs publications are an important factor in the process of combating all forms of prejudice and the arduous task of leprosy as a public health problem. Services and partnerships There are several services and partnerships Morhan provides for its patients: * Morhan is responsible for the infrastructure of Telehansen, which is a free calling service for people with leprosy. The hotline settles doubts about the disease, directs people to the places of treatment around Brazil, and receives complaints of lack of drugs, prejudice, lack of care, and abuse. * Morhan volunteers and members are responsible for manufacturing shoes for people with leprosy with the support of an Italian non-governmental organization. * Morhan hosts panfletagem, educational and informational events in which volunteers distribute pamphlets about leprosy and about Morhan and its services. * Morhan has recruited and trained women who are members of different religions to identify early leprosy symptoms and encourage people to seek biomedical treatment. * Morhan works alongside the Brazilian Association of People with Thalidomide Syndrome to guarantee and expand social rights for people affected with thalidomide syndrome. Also, they are notified about the emergence of second-generation cases of leprosy and thalidomide syndrome. In 1988, Morhan strengthened the fight against the use of thalidomide, for the treatment of reactions of leprosy. However, now the use of thalidomide is extremely controlled by the Ministry of Health. * Morhan in partnership with Novartis, has a vehicle (carreta de saude) that travels the country taking control of some essential services for leprosy patients. * Cassandra White, author of ‚ÄúAn Uncertain Cure: Living with Leprosy in Brazil‚Äù, worked with Morhan as an English- speaking liaison, translating documents, working on a World Health Organization grant proposal, and negotiating with a British cargo ship donating braces and crutches for people with leprosy. * Morhan volunteers have made house visits to patients who have abandoned treatment. * Morhan works in tandem with the Brazilian government to try to get legislation so that patients may go to different health posts in different cities to be treated at any stage during their treatment without having to go through the diagnostic exams again or start treatment from the beginning. * Morhan places posters about leprosy in public buses in Rio de Janeiro in order to raise awareness and reduce stigma. Problems * Morhan has no power to ensure the social integration of young people into the labor market. Members of the movement say that discrimination still exists, though less visible than before. * In March 2012, Morhan headquarters, located in downtown Rio de Janeiro, was hit by an accidental fire. All entities were consumed by fire, but no one was injured . Morhan and its volunteers have still maintained commitments to the community despite setbacks.

The reservoir that it impounds is known as Basava Sagar, and has a total storage capacity of 37.965 tmcft (1.075 km¬≥), with 30.5 tmcft (0.85 km¬≥) live storage. The full reservoir level is 492.25 m MSL and the minimum draw down level is 481.6 m MSL. It was a single purpose project meant only for irrigation, but downstream electrical generation and drinking water considerations enter into its management. The dam is 29 meters high and over long, and has 30 gates for water release. 22 Spillway Gates are present in the Dam It took Rs. 50.48 crore to complete. Gates There are thirty spillway gates built into the dam. Each of these spillway gates are of the Ogee type. It is a common and basic design which transfers excess water from behind the dam down a smooth incline into the river below. These are usually designed following an ogee curve. Most often, they are lined on the bottom and sides with concrete to protect the dam and topography. The dam falls under the Parliamentary Constituency of Vijayapura, and it is classified as being an earthen/ gravity and masonry build type. When it was completed in 1982 it provided water to irrigate 4.21 lakh hectares in Jewargi taluka in Gulbarga district, Shahapur and Shorapur talukas in Yadgir district, Sindagi and Indi talukas in Bijapur district, and Lingsugur and Devadurga talukas in Raichur district. Incidents In 1992, two of the irrigation gates partially failed. In 2005, there was a collapse of one of the gates in the dam and up to a lakh cusecs of water was being released before emergency actions were effective. The gate broke open on the morning of 6 October and most of the water flow was stopped by the afternoon of the 9th. Basava Sagar reservoir dropped several metres as a result. In April 2011, farmers fearing loss of their crops staged a protest at Narayanpur dam, and forced the staff to release water after officials had shut down releases due to low rainfall and inflows. This type of protests in earlier years, such as the one in April 2005 where large numbers of police prevented the farmer's from releasing the water. As of August 2013, the project has an estimated capacity of 31.47 TMC.

This especially affected the right of feuding.  Scope  Landfrieden agreements formed the political basis for pursuing claims without resorting to the private use of violence. They also often regulated the jurisdiction and thus allowed the settlement of disputes through judgements based on a common set of rules. Offences or violations of the public peace were liable to severe punishment. For example, objects or buildings (such as churches, homes, mills, agricultural implements, bridges, and especially imperial roads) and people (priests, pilgrims, merchants, women, even farmers, hunters and fishermen in carrying out their work) could be placed under protection. The Landfrieden created a type of martial law, as well as special courts, the Landfriedensgerichte.  Development  In the High Middle Ages from the 11th century onwards, the Landfrieden movement strove to extend the so-called Peace and Truce of God (Gottesfrieden). The first imperial Landfriede was established by Emperor Henry IV in 1103 for a term of four years and was known as the First Imperial Peace of Mainz (Erster Mainzer Reichslandfriede). It followed the Mainz Peace and Truce of God (Mainzer Gottesfrieden) which he had already proclaimed in 1085. In 1152 Frederick Barbarossa proclaimed the Great Imperial Peace (Gro√üer Reichslandfrieden), which extended to the whole Empire. This was an act of constitution and brought into effect a time-limited alliance of ruling princes. It was established in 1186 that a feud had to be announced in feud letter issued three days in advance. Originating from the law schools in Bologna and Pavia, the concepts of medieval Roman law (Corpus Iuris Civilis) started to dominate the legal profession under Barbarossa's rule. The most important Imperial Peace of Mainz (Mainzer Reichslandfrieden), announced by Emperor Frederick II at the Imperial Diet of 1235, was more like a legal decree and had less of the character of an alliance. Already in 1231, Frederick had issued the Constitutions of Melfi, a book of codified law and inquisitorial system applying to his Kingdom of Sicily. The Mainz Landfriede, now applicable for an indefinite period of time, was a constitutional act and became one of the basic laws that applied to the whole Empire. For the first time this document was bilingually drafted, i.e. written in both Latin and Middle High German. Subsequently, numerous regional and local Landfrieden alliances, such as city federations arose during the 13th and 14th centuries. The 1235 Peace of Mainz was superseded by the Perpetual Public Peace (Ewiger Landfriede) passed by Maximilian I in 1495, which definitely outlawed any feuds and constituted a permanent Landfriede for the Holy Roman Empire, including the establishment of the Reichskammergericht (Imperial Chamber Court).  Modern forms  Up to today a breach of the Landfrieden (Landfriedensbruch) by involvement in violent riots is a criminal offence according to German criminal law (¬ß 125 StGB) and the Austrian (¬ß 274 StGB) and Swiss (Art. 260 CH-StGB) equivalents. The preservation of the Landfrieden in the sense of public law and order ‚Äì i.e. the ban on jungle law (Faustrecht) and frontier justice (Selbstjustiz) ‚Äì by giving the state authorities a monopoly on violence, is the basis of all modern legal codes.

Sources Because the Oromo did not keep a written record of the migrations, this article must refer to Ethiopian, Portuguese, and Arabic sources for the reasons behind the migrations. In particular, a 16th-century ethnic Gamo monk named Bahrey is the foremost source on the migrations. Written in Ge'ez, his book was called the History of the Galla (Ge'ez: ·ãú·äì·àÅ ·ç° ·àà·åã·àã zƒìnahu legalla), \\"Galla\\" being an older name for \\"Oromo\\" that is now considered a pejorative. This book was written in 1593 and details the expansions from 1522 to his age. In addition to his book, further information can be gleaned from other contemporaries such as the Ethiopian monk Abba Paulos, Shihab ed-Din's Futuh al-Habasha \\"Conquest of Abyssinia\\", Jo√£o Bermudes, Francisco de Almeida, Jer√≥nimo Lobo, and various royal chronicles (e.g. those of Gelawdewos, Sarsa Dengel, and Susenyos I, though that of Sarsa Dengel may have been written by Bahrey). Early migrations The early migrations were characterized by sporadic raids by the Oromo on the frontiers of the Ethiopian kingdom. After capturing cattle and other booty, the raiding parties would quickly return to their homelands. Actual settlement of new territories would not begin until the lubaship of Mesl√©. Luba (Ge'ez ·àâ·â£ l≈´bƒÅ) is an \\"appointed\\" head of one of the five groups of the Oromo clans. M√©lbah (1522‚Äì1530) and Mudena (1530‚Äì1538) According to Bahrey, the earliest Oromo migrations occurred under the Oromo luba Melbah, during the time of Emperor Lebna Dengel. He states that they invaded the neighboring Bale in the Southeast just before the invasions of Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi of Adal (also known as Ahmed Gurey) in the north. These early incursions (Oromo: razzia) were limited, however, as the encroaching groups returned to their homeland near the Shebelle River after each raid. Raids continued under Mudena past the Wabi Shebelle, but these groups also returned home shortly. Kilol√© (1538‚Äì1546) After the death of Ahmed Gure, Kilol√© resumed his predecessor's raids, piercing further into Ethiopian territory. Aided by the weakening of both the Ethiopian Kingdom and Adal, he was able to raid as far as the province of Dawaro, north of Bali. Again, however, after each raid, the parties returned to their villages. Bahrey's dating might, however, be off, however, as Shihab ad-din, who wrote a decade before Ahmed Gragn's death, notes a locality named Werre Qallu, an Oromo name, in the province of Dewaro. Francisco de Almeida, however, agreed with Bahrey's dating, affirming that the Galla first began migrating around the time of Ahmed Gragn's invasion (1527). Bifol√© (1546‚Äì1554) During the time of luba Bifol√©, the Oromo migration achieved its first major success. While all previous movements had been minor raids on neighboring provinces, under Bifol√© new raids were undertaken that began to weaken Ethiopian control. All of Dewaro was pillaged and Fetegar to its north was attacked for the first time. Furthermore, according to Bahrey, the inhabitants of the pillaged areas were enslaved, becoming gebrs (Ge'ez ·åà·â•·à≠ gabr; Amh. gebr, Tgn. gebri), a term referring more precisely to \\"tax-paying serfs\\", similar to the serfs in Ethiopia during feudal times. Emperor Gelawdewos, however, campaigned in the south as a result of these attacks. According to his chronicle, the Emperor defeated the Oromo incursions and made subject to his rule those he captured, preventing further attacks for some time, with further incursions reduced to skirmishes. The initial attacks were significant, however, on a much larger and more devastating scale to the Ethiopian dynasty. Despite his reprisals, Gelawdewos was troubled and was forced to settle refugees in a town of Wej, north of Lake Zway, around 1550-1. Settlement Mesl√© (1554‚Äì1562) Mesl√©'s time represent a fundamental change in the migrations of the Oromo. Not only were newly taken territories permanently settled by Oromo for the first time, but mules and horses began to be ridden by the first time. The adoption of horseback-riding from the north greatly increased the Oromo fighting power, putting them on par with Ethiopian troops, who were largely unequipped with firearms. In the new phase of migration adopted under Mesl√©, the Oromo defeated Gelawdewos's troops in Jan Amora, allowing them to pillage a number of towns. Instead of returning to their homelands, however, they stayed in the new territories. Gelawdewos campaigned against the Oromo as a result, defeating them at 'Asa Zeneb (yet unidentified), but he was nevertheless unable to drive them from the frontier provinces and continued to build the new town in Wej for new refugees. Oromo migration was not restricted to Ethiopian territories, however, as activities against Adal were also pursued. The forces of Nur ibn Mujahid (r. 1551/2‚Äì1567/8), the Amir of Harar, for instance, were soundly defeated by the Oromo. According to Bahrey, there had been \\"no such slaughter since the Galla first invaded.\\" Harmufa (1562‚Äì1570) and Robal√© (1570‚Äì1578) During the luba of Harmufa rule, the Oromo advanced even deeper into Ethiopian territory. With the use of horses, they were able to attack the province Amhara, and Angot. Further advances were made under Robal√©, during whose time Shewa was pillaged and Gojjam attacked. For the first time, Oromo advances were devastating core Ethiopian provinces, whereas there earlier incursions were simply against frontier provinces. Despite the deeper attacks, the core provinces remained under Ethiopian control, and Emperor Sarsa Dengel carried out punitive expedition in return. One such reprisal in 1573 involved the engagement of Oromo near Lake Zway in a frontier province, whom he defeated, and taking their cattle and distributing it among his subjects who are described in his chronicle as \\"becoming rich\\" as a result. Adal period (1562‚Äì1579) At the same time, Barentu Oromo groups attacked Adal Sultanate, which was weakened by its wars with the Abyssinians and Portuguese Empire leading to no potential resistance. Only a few small groups of Muslims were able to flee to Zeila and survive within the fortified city. The greater part of the Muslim population of Adal mainly the northern Somalis and Hararis was assimilated by the Oromos.http://www.worldhistory.biz/sundries/32403-oromo- migration-and-expansion-sixteenth-and-seventeenth-centuries.html The city Dire Dawa was originally called Dir Dhabe and used to be part of Adal Sultanate during the medieval times and was exclusively settled by Dir which is a major Somali tribe and after the weakening of Adal Sultanate, the Oromos took advantage and were able to penetrate through the city and settle into these areas and also assimilate some of the local Gurgura clan. The Hawiye and Dir clans used to be the predominant inhabitants of Hararghe Highlands in the medieval times until the weakening of Adal Sultanate the opportunist Oromos took advantage of the crippling state and decided to invade and occupy the Haraghe Highlands and assimilate the local native Somali clan population which were Jarso, Akisho, Gurgura, Nole, Metta, Oborra and Bursuk who were all sub- clans of Dir a major Somali tribe and were later confederated into Oromo tribe, the Afran Qallo clan. However, some Somalis, namely the Karanle were still strong and were able to successfully resist the Oromo expansion in their territories and hold them off at Babille, Dire Dawa and Mieso. Reprisals under Sarsa Dengel Forced to fight the Ottomans in the north of his Empire, Sarsa Dengel turned to curb the spread of Oromo in the south in the 1570s. The first mention of his actions is in his short Royal chronicle, which states that he fought a force of Borana Oromo at Lake Zway under a luba named Ambissa. Learning that, after the 1572 rains, the Oromo had taken Wej, the Emperor gathered his forces from throughout Ethiopia to form an army at Gind Beret. From there, Sarsa Dengel headed south, where he found that the Oromo had also taken Maya. Despite the size of his army, he was able to defeat the Oromo in the area, pushing them back to Fetegar, and capture a large number of cattle. Sarsa Dengel again learned in 1574 of Oromo incursions in Shewa, and the pillaging of cattle in lowland Z√©ma. The Emperor sent Azzaj Halibo with 50 cavalry to the area, who forced the Oromo to flee sent the heads of 80 to the Emperor as trophies. Sarsa Dengel was again forced to head north with his army to confront the Ottoman-backed Bahr negus Yeshaq, but later returned to Wej in 1577-8 to fend off Oromo advances in the area. As a result of the battle in the Mojjo Valley (just east of modern Addis Ababa) against the Borana Oromo, corpses were strewn all over the surrounding countryside. The Emperor then fended off an attack in Dembiya by the Abati Oromo at a place called Weyne Deg'a and as a result of the battle, according to Bahrey, less than ten Oromo survived. Birmaj√© (1578‚Äì1586) Despite Sarsa Dengel's military campaigns, the Oromo migration continued to spread northward during this time. It was under luba Birmaj√© that the Oromo first began to use body-length ox-hide shields. These shields allowed the Oromo to resist arrows and therefore successfully defeat the Mayas. During this time period, the Oromo often came into conflict with Daharagot, one of Sarsa Dengel's commanders, who was often successful. Nevertheless, during this time, the Oromo pillaged Ar'ine in Wej, killing Ethiopian couriers in the process. Further advances were made around Lake Tana, Dembiya, and (old) Damot, which was surrounded and some of whose inhabitants were enslaved. Mul'eta (1586‚Äì1594) Under luba Mul'eta a large raid (Oromo: dulaguto) was made on Gojjam south of Lake Tana. With the Ottoman situation in the north largely under control, Sarsa Dengel again took the initiative against the Oromo in the south, where he forced the Daw√© (or Jaw√©) Oromo in Wej to flight. Bahrey praised Sarsa Dengel's campaign, stating that he \\"did not act according to the custom of the kings his ancestors, who, when making war were in the habit of sending their troops ahead, remaining themselves in the rear with the pick of their cavalry and infantry, praising those who went forward bravely and punishing those who lagged behind.\\" Despite Bahrey's praise, Sarsa Dengel was forced to use coercion to draw troops, announced decree that anyone who failed to heed his call to arms would have his house pillaged and property confiscated. 17th century Ya'qob He was a candidate to the throne of the Ethiopian dynasty which was occupied formerly by Minas and Sersa Dengil. He used to fight for the throne against Susenyos. Ajuran Empire In the mid-17th century, the Oromo Nation began expanding from its homeland around Lake Abaya in southern Ethiopia towards the southern Somali coast at the time when the Ajuran Empire was at the height of its power.Cerulli, Somalia 1: 65‚Äì67 The Garen rulers conducted several military expeditions known as the Gaal Madow wars against the Oromo warriors, converting those that were captured to Islam. The Ajuran military supremacy forced the Oromo conquerors to reverse their migrations towards the Christian Solomonids and the Muslim Adalites, devastating the two warring empires in the process. 18th century In around 1710 the Macha Oromo conquered the Gonga kingdom of Ennarea in the Gibe region.

He also speaks and hosts workshops on video game music, chiptunes, and composing. Biography Becker, born in America in 1979, claims to have had a typical childhood where he was obsessed with video games and Saturday-morning cartoons. While he was enrolled in a piano class at an early age, he did not keep interest due to attention span issues. However, his interest in computers, programming, and music led him to the demoscene. He soon began composing music with a music tracker for games written by his grade school friends, as well as various remixes and covers. In 2010, Becker received extensive media coverage for his NES parody of CeeLo Green's single, \\"Fuck You\\". A month later, the soundtrack to the video game Super Meat Boy featured his song \\"Boss Burger N' Chips\\", a remix of the first and second level boss themes. In mid-2011, Becker announced that he had gone full-time with his music and was working on multiple game soundtracks. Later that year, he released soundtracks to Super Smash Land and Shuttle Scuttle, handing out copies of the latter to MAGFest X attendees at a secret show shortly thereafter.Inverse Phase - Shuttle Scuttle OST released In June 2012, he released Pretty Eight Machine, a tribute album of industrial rock band Nine Inch Nails' 1989 debut album Pretty Hate Machine.

Their research, education, and action programs address the issues that are endangering polar bears. The organization also studies polar bears and monitors their activity data which helped lead to the animals being listed as a threatened species. While Churchill, Canada, serves as an important hub for PBI scientists and educators, the organization's work on behalf of polar bears spans the Arctic including Svalbard, Russia and Alaska. PBI's Chief Scientist is Steven Amstrup, winner of the 2012 Indianapolis Prize. Description Churchill, Manitoba is known throughout the world as the place where hundreds of polar bears gather each fall to wait for the sea ice to return to Hudson Bay. The town is also a hub for Polar Bears International and several of PBI's programs including Tundra Connections webcasts ‚Äì free, live webcasts provided by polar bear and climate scientists and geared towards students, families and professionals, Polar Bear Cams with Explore.org, and Climate Alliance training take place. Polar bears are marine mammals, adapted to life on frozen or partly-frozen ocean. They hunt seals from the surface of the sea ice, and also rely on the ice to travel. Sea ice is as important to the Arctic as the soil is to the forest ‚Äì it supports the entire Arctic food chain. Arctic sea ice is melting at a rate of 12.8% per decade. The 13 lowest Arctic sea extents on record have all occurred in the last 13 years. In partnership with Google, polar bear habitats in Churchill were added to Google Maps in February 2014. PBI has worked with the Association of Zoos and Aquariums to create education programs regarding polar bear conservation. In November 2019, PBI unveiled the Polar Bears International House, a new center in Churchill. Research Denned polar bears are invisible under the snow; therefore winter-time petroleum exploration and development activities in northern Alaska have potential to disturb maternal polar bears and their cubs. Previous research determined forward looking infrared (FLIR) imagery could detect many polar bear maternal dens under the snow, but also identified limitations of FLIR imagery.

In 2012 he came out as gay, and launched a campaign to tackle homophobia in Australian rules football. He stood for the Australian Greens as a candidate in the House of Representatives seat of Higgins at the 2016 Federal election and 2019 Federal election. In 2017 he was named the Young Australian of the Year for Victoria. Background and early life Ball attended high school at Yarra Valley Grammar and completed a Bachelor of Arts at the University of Melbourne in 2010. He played for the Yarra Glen Football Club in the Yarra Valley Mountain District Football League until taking time off in 2015 due to injury. Ball credits his rural upbringing for fostering an interest in protecting the environment, and a high school exchange to Kansas for awakening an interest in critical thinking, philosophy and secularism. Activism  AFL anti-homophobia campaign  Ball started a petition on change.org on 9 September 2012 that called on the Australian Football League (AFL) to play \\"No To Homophobia\\" television commercials on the big screen of the 2012 AFL Grand Final and also commit to a Pride Round. The petition received over 29,000 signatures and gained national and international media coverage. The AFL agreed to screen the No to Homophobia TVCs during the preliminary finals that year. Ball was invited to lead the 18th Pride March Victoria alongside his teammates from the Yarra Glen Football Club. They were also joined by AFL footballers Brock McLean and Daniel Jackson, marking the first time AFL players had been formally involved in the event. In 2013, Ball partnered with the AFL Players Association to launch a social media campaign tackling homophobic language in sport, featuring some of the AFL's biggest names, including Jobe Watson, Scott Pendlebury and Andrew Swallow.  Pride Cup / Pride Game  On 3 May 2014, Ball's team Yarra Glen hosted the inaugural Pride Cup, which saw the 50 metre lines at each end of the oval painted in rainbow colours. The AFL supported the event by hosting a pre-match function, and General Manager of Football Operations Mark Evans announced that the AFL would support a national Pride Cup, and that it was up to clubs to show interest. As part of the 2015 Pride Cup, an education program was developed to help players and coaches challenge homophobia in sport. The organisers behind the 2015 Cup were awarded a VicHealth Award for building health through sport on 1 December 2015. In August 2015 St Kilda Football Club CEO Matt Finnis announced that the club would lobby the AFL for a Pride Game for the 2016 fixture, inspired by Yarra Glen's Pride Cup. It was confirmed in October 2015 that the first AFL Pride Game will be contested between St Kilda and Sydney in round 21 of the 2016 season.  Mental health and LGBTI inclusion  In 2013, Ball became an ambassador for beyondblue, the Australian national mental health initiative. In this role he has spoken to schools, sporting clubs and workplaces across the country. From 2014 to 2015, Ball was an ambassador for Safe Schools Coalition Australia, an organisation which aims to make schools safer and more inclusive for LGBTI students. Ball worked as a Government Liaison and Project Officer for the Young and Well Cooperative Research Centre from 2014 to 2015, a non-profit organisation that explores the role of technology in improving the mental health of young people. Secularism Ball was an organiser and spokesperson for the 2010 and 2012 Global Atheist Conventions held in Melbourne, Victoria. He presented at the 2012 convention with a talk titled A Fresh Generation of Freethinkers is Among Us. He was also the co-founder and President of the Freethought Student Alliance, a coalition of Australian atheist, secular, humanist and skeptic campus groups. Awards Ball was included in The Age Top 100 most influential Melburnians of 2012 and was amongst The Advocate's Top 25 Most Notable Comings Out of 2012. He was named LGBTI Sports Person of the Year at the second annual GLOBE Community Awards in 2015. The awards recognise outstanding contributions and achievements in the LGBTI community in Victoria. He was also a finalist for LGBTI Person of the Year at the same event. Pop culture and news website Junkee included Ball in \\"The Disruptors\\", their list of thirty people \\"changing the game for young Australia\\". Other disruptors included Waleed Aly, Adam Goodes and Marita Cheng. Ball was also featured in Executive Style magazine's list of \\"The 10 men who mattered in Australia in 2015\\". In May 2016 the University of Melbourne presented Ball with the Arts Alumni Rising Star Award recognising his \\"outstanding level of personal achievement and community involvement\\". Further, the Council of Australian Humanist Societies honoured Jason's advocacy within mental health and LGBTI equality by naming him the Young Australian Humanist of the Year for 2016. In 2017 he was named the Young Australian of the Year for Victoria, and received the Out Role Model Award in the inaugural Pride In Sport Awards. Political candidacy On 10 August 2015, Ball announced that he was standing as the Greens candidate for the House of Representatives seat of Higgins at the 2016 Federal election, against Kelly O'Dwyer. He stated he wanted his campaign to focus on climate change, asylum seeker policy, science and mental health. The 2016 result in Higgins saw an 8.5% increase in the Greens vote, with a two party preferred outcome of 58% Liberal compared to 42% Greens. On 4 May 2018, Ball announced that he would re-contest the seat of Higgins at the 2019 Federal election. On 20 January 2019, Kelly O'Dwyer announced she would quit politics and not re- contest the seat of Higgins at the next election. O'Dwyer was replaced by paediatrician Katie Allen on 24 February 2019. On 22 March 2019 the Labor Party replaced their Higgins candidate with high-profile barrister Fiona McLeod, following reports of polling that showed the Liberals could lose Higgins. The 2019 result in Higgins saw an 8.5% increase in Labor's vote and a 3.7% drop in the Liberal vote. The Greens vote decreased slightly by 1.7%. The two party preferred outcome was 54% Liberal compared to 46% Labor, with Katie Allen being elected as the new member for Higgins.

De Winter (known as the \\"poison star-apple\\" or \\"Bostolbos\\") is a Southern African tree belonging to the ebony family of Ebenaceae and closely related to the Persimmon (Diospyros kaki). Description The genus Diospyros includes some 700 species, many of which are ornamental and many which bear edible and often cultivated fruit. This species grows into a medium-sized tree of up to 15 m tall. It is multi-stemmed and forms a dense canopy. The bark is greyish-brown, and smooth to slightly wrinkled, occasionally armed with robust, wooden spikes which are the remains of the bases of former branches. The young growth is covered in yellowish hairs with a velvety texture. The simple leaves are alternate, and oblong to oval with bluntly pointed or rounded tips, glossy, dark green above and pale green below. The leaf edges are often tightly rolled under. The creamy-white flowers are bell-shaped and pendulous, occurring between November and March, are pentamerous with petals and sepals strongly reflexed. The male and female flowers are borne on separate plants. Fruits are up to 25 mm in diameter, depressed‚Äìglobose or pumpkin-shaped, with a dense covering of velvety hairs, and the strongly accrescent calyx persisting. The clear, jelly-like pulp holds from 3 to 8 shiny brown, slender, 10 mm long seeds, each with a single prominent dark spot. Some authors describe it as being poisonous, which is puzzling as generally ripe fruits from this genus are quite tasty and edible, though green fruits are rich in tannins. Distribution and habitat This species is common in coastal scrub, on coastal sandy flats, and along the edges of forests. It is found along a wide coastal belt from Montagu and the Overberg region in the Western Cape, eastward and northwards through the Eastern Cape and along the KwaZulu/Natal coast, in Swaziland, along the Lebombo Mountains and the Soutpansberg, and further north to Mozambique. It prefers moist regions with a high rainfall.

It works around the digital rights management built into online- store-published e-books by limiting access to a purchased e-book file to the borrower, resulting in loss of access to the file by the purchaser for the duration of the borrowing period. As of 2014, over 90% of U.S. public libraries offer ebook lending.American Library Association: 90% of Libraries in U.S. Now Lend Ebooks. Retrieved 11 February 2015. Many of those libraries use Rakuten OverDrive, which provides ebook access to about 43,000 libraries and schools in 76 countries. Overdrive is the only elending service that works with the Amazon Kindle, but that functionality is limited to U.S. library readers only. E-book lending is different from physical book lending. Libraries have always been able to acquire and lend physical books without requiring any special permission from publishers. However, acquiring and lending ebooks involves the making of copies and transmissions, which means copyright laws need to be complied with. As a result, publishers get to decide the terms on which libraries can access books for elending. Since 2011, HarperCollins has allowed libraries to lend out its ebooks just 26 times before the licence expires and the book is deleted from its collection. In 2018, Penguin Random House announced that all of its books would be available only on two year licences, after which they would also be deleted from collections. Hachette Book Group makes some of its books available for library elending in the United States and Canada, but refuses to do so within Commonwealth countries such as the UK, Australia and New Zealand.. Amazon Publishing is the world's fifth-largest supplier of ebooks, but as of late 2019, also refuses to license them to public libraries (in any country). E-book lending has become an increasing practice in the early 2010s for public libraries as well as independent e-book lending communities; the latter is increasingly viable, especially for books which are not available in the Amazon Kindle's Kindle Format, Mobipocket or Barnes & Noble Nook formats. Websites such as Lendle.me and bookLending.com have emerged to facilitate lending and borrowing of books between strangers. In a survey of interlibrary loan librarians it was found that 92% of libraries held ebooks in their collections and that 27% of those libraries had negotiated interlibrary loan rights for some of their ebooks. This survey found significant barriers to conducting interlibrary loan for ebooks.Linda Frederiksen, Joel Cummings, Lara Cummings and Diane Carroll. \\"Ebooks and Interlibrary Loan.\\" Journal of Interlibrary Loan, Document Delivery and Electronic Reserves. 21(31), 2011. 117-131. http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1072303X.2011.585102# Demand-driven acquisition (DDA) has been around for a few years in public libraries, which allows vendors to streamline the acquisition process by offering to match a library's selection profile to the vendor's e-book titles. The library's catalog is then populated with records for all the e-books that match the profile. The decision to purchase the title is left to the patrons, although the library can set purchasing conditions such as a maximum price and purchasing caps so that the dedicated funds are spent according to the library's budget.Becker, B. W. The e-Book Apocalypse: A Survivor's Guide. Behavioral & Social Sciences Librarian v. 30 no. 3 (July 2011) p. 181‚Äì4 The 2012 meeting of the Association of American University Presses included a panel on DDA of books produced by university presses based on a preliminary report by Joseph Esposito, a digital publishing consultant who has studied the implications of PDA with a grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.Steve Kolowich, \\"Affection for PDA,\\" Inside Higher Ed June 20, 2012 http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2012/06/20/research-foresees-demand-driven- book-acquisition-replacing-librarians-discretion#ixzz1ycQKnfeo Some publishers have feared that making books available for loan may deter people from buying the books. However, ebook lending has the potential to increase the discoverability of books, encouraging readers to try out new authors and genres, resulting in increased purchases. The Panorama Project has also reported positive results when OverDrive highlights books as part of its 'Big Library Read' community reading campaigns. When first-time author Jennifer McGaha's 'Flat Broke With Two Goats' was selected for the April 2018 'Big Library Read', it was featured by over 14,700 US public libraries and saw its sales grow by 818% for ebooks and 201% (for print). In December 2010, Amazon introduced the ability for Kindle users to lend ebooks to friends for a 14-day period. However, not all books support lending. Alternative lending models Amazon operates a Kindle Owners' Lending Library that enables paid Amazon Prime users to borrow from a collection of over 600,000 ebooks without any due date, with books being delivered to Kindle and Kindle Fire devices, but not to the free Kindle reading apps for other platforms. The same book can be borrowed by a number of users at the same time, and users may keep a book for as long as they want. Alternatively, the books that are available in the public domain can be downloaded in different formats from many sites like archive.org.

The film explores the life of Koko, who was cast as Red Dog in the original film.  Biography  Koko was born in Victoria, Australia in 2005 to breeders Carol and Len Hobday and initially trained as a show dog. He won Best Exhibiting Group, Working Dogs in January 2006. It was quite unusual for a dog so young to win in that group. Koko came to prominence in 2011 for his work in Red Dog, which was based on a true story about a dog in a mining town and the relationships that he develops. He won the Golden Collar Award for Best Dog in a Foreign Film in Los Angeles for his portrayal. A painting of Koko with producer Nelson Woss by artist Adam Cullen was a finalist in the 2012 Archibald Prize. In 2012, Koko was retired after he was diagnosed with congestive heart disease. However, he still continued to make appearances for the RSPCA and Dogs' Refuge Home WA http://www.dogshome.org.au/ in return for donations.  Death  Koko died from heart failure on December 18 2012, in Perth, Western Australia. He was 7 years old. The prequel, Red Dog: True Blue was dedicated to his memory.

The episode serves as the tenth episode of the sixth season and the show's 121st episode overall. Written by Stephanie Savage, and directed by Mark Piznarski, the series finale originally aired on The CW in the United States on December 17, 2012. Gossip Girl follows the lives of a group of young adults coming from a wealthy background. In this final episode, the death of Bart Bass rushes Chuck Bass (Ed Westwick) to marry Blair Waldorf (Leighton Meester) and the identity of Gossip Girl is revealed. A five-year flash forward takes place and shows the wedding of Dan Humphrey (Penn Badgley) to Serena van der Woodsen (Blake Lively). \\"New York, I Love You XOXO\\" received favorable reviews from television critics. Upon its initial airing, the finale was viewed in the United States by 1.55 million people and garnered a 0.8/2 Nielsen rating/share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, registering as the season's most-watched episode. Plot The series finale picked up where the previous episode left off, where Chuck Bass (Ed Westwick) and Bart argue on the roof ending with Bart falling off the building. Chuck and Blair Waldorf (Leighton Meester) leave the scene and hide from the police as Chuck is considered \\"a person of interest\\" in the case. Jack Bass (Desmond Harrington), Chuck's uncle, comes to help him and suggests the two get married since spousal privilege prevents a wife from unwillingly testifying against her husband. Chuck thus proposes to Blair who tearfully accepts. Serena van der Woodsen (Blake Lively) discovers the alternate chapter about her that Dan Humphrey (Penn Badgley) wrote and put in her bag before she left for Los Angeles. She reads the chapter and decides to stay in New York to confront Dan. William van der Woodsen (William Baldwin) shows up to support Lily Bass (Kelly Rutherford) and tells Ivy Dickens (Kaylee DeFer) that he used her to get back to Lily. With the death of Bart Bass, Nate Archibald (Chace Crawford) who is running the newspaper The Spectator, is no longer indebted to him (Bart paid his debts to control him) and he decides to find out for good who Gossip Girl is. Jack and Georgina Sparks (Michelle Trachtenberg) deal with the arrangements of Chuck and Blair's wedding. Before the ceremony, Serena and Blair have a conversation over why she is still talking to Dan after he published a negative chapter about her a few weeks ago. Overhearing their conversation, Dan leaves and gives to Nate his final chapter, which is about Gossip Girl. Blair and Chuck are married by Cyrus (Wallace Shawn) and right after, the police arrive to question them. At the same time, everyone's phones ring: Dan's chapter has been published in The Spectator, in which he reveals that he is Gossip Girl. Various characters react over the Gossip Girl reveal, including Vanessa (Jessica Szohr), Juliet (Katie Cassidy), Agnes (Willa Holland) and Lola (Ella Rae Peck), as well as Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Rachel Bilson, preparing to audition for a role in the adaptation of Dan's book, is told of Gossip Girl's identity by Kristen Bell, who shares a conspiratorial wink with the audience. Dan finally explains why he created Gossip Girl and says Jenny (Taylor Momsen) knew it all along. 5 Years Later: It's the day of Dan and Serena's wedding. Chuck and Blair are now parents of a son named Henry. Nate, now a successful businessman with The Spectator flourishing, is likely to run for Mayor of New York. Ivy has written an autobiography about her career as a con artist in the Upper East Side, which was adapted into a film starring both Lola and Olivia Burke (Hilary Duff). Blair and Jenny have become business partners in the fashion world and together they have created a clothing line called \\"J for Waldorf\\". Lily and William are back together while Rufus (Matthew Settle) is in a relationship with Lisa Loeb. Jack Bass and Georgina have also become a couple. The final scene shows the new generation of high school kids on the Upper East Side, mirroring the elite and the exclusion. The show ends as a new Gossip Girl is teased as \\"there will always be someone on the outside wanting to get in.\\" Production The episode was written by Stephanie Savage, while Mark Piznarski directed it. On October 31, 2012, TVLine revealed the title of the finale would be \\"New York, I Love You XOXO\\". Filming of the episode took place in October 2012 in New York. Some scenes were filmed at the Metropolitan Museum of Art while Blair and Chuck's wedding scene was filmed near the Bethesda Terrace. Featured music included Great Northern's cover of \\"Bonnie & Clyde\\", Rihanna's Pon De Replay, Imagine Dragons's \\"It's Time\\", Release the Sunbird's cover of Talking Heads' \\"Road to Nowhere\\", The Mynabirds' \\"Body of Work\\", Florence and the Machine's \\"You've Got the Love\\", and The Pretty Reckless' \\"Kill Me\\" as closing song. On October 5, 2012, executive producers Stephanie Savage and Sara Goodman told the reveal of who was behind Gossip Girl would happen in the sixth and final season. Savage said they didn't plan at first to reveal the identity of Gossip Girl but that they changed their minds because of the fifth season's storyline. On November 14, 2012, TVLine announced there would be a flashforward in the finale. Savage later told there would also be a flashback. Costume designer Eric Daman dressed Blair (Meester) with a headband and Chuck (Westwick) with a scarf (in the flashback) as a tribute to previous seasons. Blair wore an Elie Saab dress for her wedding, while Serena (Lively) wore a Missoni dress. Serena's wedding dress was designed by Georges Chakra. Jenny (Momsen) and Blair both wore Zuhair Murad dresses to Serena and Dan's wedding while Georgina's dress was designed by Robert Rodriguez. Kristen Bell, narrator of the series, appears onscreen in this finale for the first time. Casting Several former cast members returned for the finale. Desmond Harrington reprised his role as Chuck's uncle, Jack Bass. News of Connor Paolo and Taylor Momsen's returns surfaced on October 16, 2012 when Kelly Rutherford posted on Instagram a picture of them on set. Katie Cassidy, Ella Rae Peck, Jessica Szohr, and Willa Holland also returned for small appearances. Long-time narrator Kristen Bell appeared in the episode as herself reading her lines alongside Rachel Bilson. On Bell's cameo Savage told: \\"It was really funny and very, very special to be shooting with her. She's an intimate part of our family but yet we never get to see her. To be able to make her a part of our storytelling just felt like the perfect way to crown her work with us over the years.\\" She added: \\"If you‚Äôre going to have those two ladies together in a scene then we wanted to have fun and play to their strengths. So Josh Schwartz and I came up with the whole idea... To be able to have Kristen onscreen for the finale was great. And to have Rachel do it with her was just the icing on the cake.\\" The episode also included cameo-appearances by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Lisa Loeb. Loeb, who had previously appeared in the show during the first season, ended up as Rufus' final partner. The writers made this choice so that he would not be alone but with someone from \\"his world\\", another musician. Reception \\"New York, I Love You XOXO\\" was first broadcast on December 17, 2012 in the United States on The CW. The episode in the United States was watched by 1.55 million people and scored a 0.8/2 Nielsen rating/share in the adults among the 18‚Äì49 demographic, making it the most watched episode since April 25, 2011. Sandra Gonzalez of Entertainment Weekly gave a positive review of the final installment, summarizing it as \\"a perfect balance of nostalgia, mythology, wit, trickery, and closure\\". Despite calling the choice of Dan being Gossip Girl \\"edgy, daring and probably dripping in inconsistency,\\" she was satisfied that \\"it didn‚Äôt turn out to be an unknown person or peripheral character. The writers chose Gossip Girl straight from the heart of the gang ‚Äî and that decision deserves some respect.\\" She also appreciated the flashbacks describing them as \\"charming\\" as well as Chuck and Blair's wedding, which she called \\"gorgeous\\", and enjoyed the guest-star appearances. Writing for Newsday, Verne Gay thought the reveal of who was behind Gossip Girl was not surprising but was \\"a nice sort of perverse poetic justice.\\" The Hollywood Reporter Philiana Ng wrote the episode \\"reminded viewers of what Gossip Girl ultimately is and should be remembered as: a soapy, cheeky guilty pleasure.\\" Rating it 4.8/5, Courtney Morrison of TV Fanatic described the finale as \\"epic\\". She liked Desmond Harrington's return and picked the five-year flash forward as a highlight of the episode. Even if she was surprised that Dan turned out to be Gossip Girl, she found that it \\"made sense\\". However The A.V. Club gave the episode a grade F, citing that it was \\"excruciatingly boring\\". They also criticised the revelation that Dan was Gossip Girl \\"so he not only, um, used Gossip Girl as a platform for spreading rumors, denigrating his friends, revealing his sister‚Äôs sex life in public and embarrassing ways, and, oh yes, nearly getting himself expelled (that is some ninja double-crossing skill)‚Äîhe was using it to try to impress a girl that was literally the subject of his stalker-takedown-campaign for at least two years, if not for the run of the entire show.\\" References External links * * \\"New York, I Love You XOXO\\" at TV.com * \\"New York, I Love You XOXO\\" at The CW.com Category:2012 American television episodes Category:American television series finales Category:Gossip Girl (season 6) episodes Category:Michael Bloomberg Category:Television episodes about weddings ","title":"New York, I Love You XOXO"},{"id":"37964380","text":" ","title":"Calcaratus"},{"id":"37964384","text":"Prak Sovannara former manager of the Cambodia national football team.

The gunman, then 17-year-old Anatcha Boonkwan (a.k.a. \\"Nung\\") fatally shot two of his fellow students, and injured four others, using a semi-automatic pistol. This was apparently due to him having argued with classmate Sicharat Kumsuk, who was his actual target. Victims The two killed were: * Kraisorn Kanchanadul, 17 * Wanida Klaewbang, 17 The four injured were: * Wanida Kaewpan * Srijaras Khumsuk * Wuthidej Promthong * Yodrak Paenthao * Kanokwan Mokthong All the injured victims were then 17 at the time of the incident. Shooting Anatcha Boonkwan, the perpetrator, was a student at the Pak Phanang school. A day prior to the shooting, Boonkwan had a tiff with his classmate, Sicharat Kumsuk. According to Kumsuk, it was a \\"trading of insults\\". On June 6, 2003, while students gathered on the school field to listen to a speech, Boonkwan attempted to shoot Kumsuk using a 9mm semi-automatic pistol which he had stolen from his father. His father, realising that his weapon had been stolen, then rushed to school. He arrived before the younger Boonkwan opened fire. Upon learning of his father's arrival, Anatcha Boonkwan took out the pistol and fired seven shots, but only one hit Kumsuk. The others struck his other classmates. The total death toll was 2, while 4 others were injured. Boonkwan was subsequently arrested by local police. Reaction In response to the shooting, then prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra said that the incident was a \\"deplorable emulation of an example set in western countries\\". He added that he would \\"work with the Education Ministry to prevent more school shootings\\". Friends of Kraisorn Kanchanadul, one of the two who were fatally shot, expressed their desire to \\"seek revenge\\" on Boonkwan.

He wrote for a working- class readership (e.g. Guy and Gal, 1924) and for children (e.g. Where Children Come From, 1926). After 1933, as a refugee from Nazi Germany, he lived predominantly in Norway and Sweden. Life Max Hodann was born in Neisse, Upper Silesia, the son of a military doctor.

It was the third in a series of four Filipino horror films produced by Romero and Kane W. Lynn known as the \\"Blood Island\\" series, which also included Terror Is a Man, Brides of Blood and Beast of Blood. Beverly Miller was associate producer on this film, and later went on to co-produce several other Filipino horror films. This film dared to go a step further than Brides of Blood in the nudity and gore department. The plot involves a man traveling to an island where a mad scientist named Dr. Lorca is creating human/ plant mutants with chlorophyll blood out of the local natives. The film was later syndicated to television as Tomb of the Living Dead. It was also briefly known in certain states as The Mad Doctor of Crimson Island. Plot A woman running naked through the jungle on Blood Island is killed by a green- skinned beast that resembles a man. At the same time, a ship arrives at the island carrying American pathologist Bill Foster, who is investigating a strange chlorophyll disease among the islanders; Sheila Willard, who has come to Blood Island seeking to reunite with her father; and Carlos Lopez (Ronaldo Valdez), who wants to get his mother, Mrs. Lopez, to move off the island. The captain of the ship claims that the island is cursed and tells a story of a man they picked up on a raft who bled green blood before he escaped into the sea. Sheila discovers that her father is a hopeless alcoholic. Mrs. Lopez does not want to leave the island, even though her husband, Don Ramon Lopez, died there recently under mysterious circumstances. The suspicious Dr. Lorca will not reveal any details about Don Ramon's death to anyone. When Foster and Lopez exhume the grave of Don Ramon, it is empty. Rumors abound about a green- skinned monster with chlorophyll blood that has been killing the local natives. One night, a native with green sores on his body tries to break into the government house, but runs off into the jungle when he is confronted. Sheila is attacked in the jungle by the chlorophyll monster, but manages to escape when an unfortunate native who comes to her rescue is gruesomely mutilated by the creature. Sheila and Dr. Foster fall in love during their stay on the island. It is revealed that Dr. Lorca has been experimenting on the natives, including the unfortunate Don Ramon, who had sought Dr. Lorca's serum as a treatment for his cancer, but was turned into a monster instead. They learn that Don Ramon is actually the green-blooded beast that has been killing people on the island. Don Ramon kills his wife, and almost kills his son Carlos, but at the last moment a glimmer of humanity returns to the creature and realizing what a monster he has become, he attacks Dr. Lorca in his hidden lab instead. A fire breaks out in Lorca's lab, resulting in a huge explosion, killing Dr. Lorca, his assistant and the monster. Sheila, her father, Dr. Foster and Carlos all return to the ship, glad to finally leave Blood Island. But as the ship leaves port, a grisly hand appears from underneath a boat tarp, dripping green blood.

Murphy as Captain *Eddie Garcia as the monster Production Prior to production on The Mad Doctor of Blood Island, Ashley had starred in Brides of Blood. The film was popular enough in the United States to get American distributors to ask him to appear in a follow-up film. Ashley agreed, which led to his moving to the Philippines and co-producing several other films there in partnership with Romero, Beverly Miller and Roger Corman. Mad Doctor was produced by Romero and Kane W. Lynn along with Miller and Irwin Pizor, on a budget of either $125,000 or $100,000.Tom Weaver, \\"Interview with John Ashley\\", Interviews with B Science Fiction and Horror Movie Makers: Writers, Producers, Directors, Actors, Moguls and Makeup, McFarland 1988 p. 42 The score was composed by Tito Arevalo. Promotion A prologue to the film invited theatergoers to partake in a bizarre initiation, and each patron was given a free packet of colored liquid labelled \\"green blood\\". At a certain point, the audience was told to \\"recite the oath of green blood\\" as they tore open the little packets and drank the colored liquid inside. By doing this, the viewer could safely watch \\"the unnatural green- blooded ones without fear of contamination\\". The prologue was shot at Clark Air Base in Manila using American teenagers. Sam Sherman came up with the idea of distributing the liquid gel-packs to the theatergoers, and said years later in an interview that he drank one of the packets, which contained an aqua- colored gel, and it made him sick to his stomach. Nevertheless, Miller (an associate producer of the film) said he actually witnessed dozens of teenagers drinking the stuff in the theaters that he managed in Kansas City. In another gimmick, the camera zoomed in and out rapidly each time the monster killed or stalked someone, a technique that some theatergoers complained made them dizzy and was actually designed to cover up the shoddy make-up effects. Release The film was released in the U.S. in 1969 on a double feature with the 1967 European film The Blood Demon. In 1969, a practice arose in some states (Rhode Island in particular) wherein the local newspapers began omitting the word \\"blood\\" from the titles of films they were advertising. In certain areas, Mad Doctor was advertised as The Mad Doctor of Crimson Island and The Blood Demon became The Crimson Demon, etc. This practice did not last very long, and by the time the sequel Beast of Blood was released, Hemisphere was again able to use the word \\"blood\\" again in their titles. Image Entertainment released Mad Doctor on DVD in 2002, featuring a commentary track by Sherman and an interview with Romero.Sherman, Sam (2002). \\"Mad Doctor of Blood Island\\" (audio commentary track). Image Entertainment. ID146211DVD. Reception Mad Doctor of Blood Island received mostly negative reviews from critics. Dennis Schwartz from Ozus' World Movie Reviews awarded the film a C grade, calling it \\"dreary\\" and stating that the film \\"is as bad as it sounds\\". On his website Fantastic Movie Musings and Ramblings, Dave Sindelar called it \\" intermittently fun but intermittently disappointing as well\\". Paul Gaita from Allmovie liked the film. While noting the film's poor camerawork, Gaita stated that the film \\"has a loopy charm that will be best appreciated by fans of low-budget horror\\". TV Guide gave the film 1 out of 5 stars, criticizing the film's dialogue and overuse of zoom shots. The film proved to be popular commercially, and was followed by the last film in the series, Beast of Blood (1970), which saw the return of the chlorophyll creature. Romero later said of Mad Doctor: \\"We thought it was one of the worst things we ever did... I can't account for it [the film's impact]\\".

Parma is usually taken to mean the Highest, the utmost or the most excellent, but actually means - \\"beyond\\". And ƒÄnanda, which means, happiness and bliss and most often used to refer to joy though it does not exactly mean these because the original meaning implies permanence rather than just a momentary surge of delight or happiness; it also suggests a deep-seated spiritual emotion that is solidly entrenched. The Upanishadic Seers have used the word, ƒÄnanda, to denote Brahman, the limitless, formless, infinite, indestructible, sole eternal Supreme Being or Sole Reality, to mean, Brahmanmayah, i.e. full of Brahman. Jivanmukti Joy, Happiness or Bliss, which is one of the four moral ends towards which human beings always direct all their efforts, is derived via decidedly good thoughts and good deeds that depend on the state and on the control of the mind, which means, depending on the evenness of one‚Äôs own temper or in other words, through the practice of equanimity in the performance of every act without becoming instrumental in making those actions bear fruit ; the state of supreme bliss is reached through evenness of the mind with reference to all aspects of one‚Äôs life. The Bhagvad Gita, by using five verbs viz. ‡§ï‡§∞‡•ã‡§∑‡§ø Karoshi (ordinary activities carried on for earning a livelihood, social duties etc.;), ‡§Ö‡§∂‡•ç‡§®‡§æ‡§∏‡§ø Ashnaasi (activities intended to keep the body and soul together by intake of food etc.;), ‡§ú‡•Å‡§π‡•ã‡§∑‡§ø Juhoshi (activities connected with worship, meditation etc.;), ‡§¶‡§¶‡§æ‡§∏‡§ø Dadaasi (activities connected with charity etc.;) and ‡§§‡§™‡§∏‡•ç‡§Ø‡§∏‡§ø Tapasyasi (activities which bring about self-restraint, all forms of austere penance etc.;), does enumerate those actions with which the ordinary man identifies himself with, attaches to and craves for their fruits, the practice of equanimity includes shunning of this wrong identification, attachment and craving. A person experiences delight which follows from the contact of the senses with their objects of enjoyments, and there is also enjoyment derived through practice of adoration, meditation, etc.; whereby end of sorrow is reached. But even this is not the state of supreme or true happiness. Both, the Physical good and the Spiritual good, result in bliss; whereas the former by itself is an aspect of bliss, the latter constitutes the acme of bliss. According to the Vedanta school of Hindu philosophy, ƒÄnanda is that state of sublime delight when the Jiva, the individual empirical self, becomes free from all sins, all doubts, all desires, all actions, all pains, all sufferings and also all physical and mental ordinary pleasures, having become established in Brahman, the eternal Universal Self and the subtle essence underlying all existence, it becomes Jivanmukta, it becomes liberated. Experience with self-realisation The sage of the Rig veda of the Sukta 10.109 reminds us that since \\"speech\\" in its undifferentiated state serves no purpose in the performance of the yagnas meant to invoke the gods who were amongst the first- born, this dosha of speech is required to be removed by making it differentiated i.e. recognisable and understandable, existence has come to being through part differentiation of the Undifferentiated in order to experience both, the differentiated and the undifferentiated. Parashara does not imply rebirth of the liberated souls for in his Mantra R.V.1.72.2 he uses the word, amritaah, to mean the uncreated eternal state, and the phrase, pade parame, to refer to the most exalted state of perfect unity with the Undifferentiated Universal Consciousness from which point of journey there is no return ‚Äì Anaavrttiah shabadaata (Brahma Sutra 4.4.22). Even though Vakya Vritti Sl.53. explains that Kaivalya is the final destination of evolution reaching which destination one gains the state of Absolute Oneness with the Divine, and by knowing one‚Äôs own true essence enjoys endless immeasurable bliss called Padamapada Yama tells Naciketa that whereas Mind is Buddhi, above the Buddhi is the Mahat Atman, above the Mahat Atman is the Avyakta and above that is the Purusha, but above the Purusha there is nothing else (Katha Upanishad I.3.10-11) and Krishna tells Arjuna that even though all embodied beings emanate from the Unmanifest only to ultimately merge into that very Unmanifest - But far beyond even this Unmanifest there is yet another external Unmanifest Existence, that Supreme Divine Being who does not perish even when all things perish. Bhagavad Gita VIII. There is nothing else whatsoever because \\" the constituents that spring from ignorance can have no remnant after their resorption through knowledge.\\" ‚Äì Adi Shankara And, even otherwise the Jiva is certainly a false appearance for it is merely a reflection of the supreme Self (Brahma Sutra II.iii.50) which reflection is removed through Self-realisation alone. To know that the Self already stands realised is not at all difficult for one becomes aware of Self-realisation at once with the dawn of the knowledge of the highest. But knowing this much and that too without experiencing the spiritual progress and the ecstasy in knowing it, is like not knowing the Self, it is like not knowing what purity actually means. In that state of realisation all finite ideas cease, the man of realisation simply exists as the Self who is the Eternal Bliss, and as the eternal subject distinct from all other objects. Hence, there is the experience of Paramananda to be gained as being distinct from ƒÄnanda. Self-realisation Ramachandra Dattatrya Ranade states that the bliss of Self-realisation is experienced only when the Self is made to stand in its native purity and grandeur and it is implied that the Self is the sole object of desire, but he warns that the word Self or Atman should not be interpreted in an egoistic sense. While enjoying the bliss of Self-realisation one sees his own form in a flood of supreme light arising from within himself. The unique awareness of Sameness, which is actually the awareness of Oneness, is the knowledge of Reality, which is Bliss, and the sole source of bliss. The bliss of Self-realisation is Paramananda. It is the experience gained by reaching out to the more sublime regions that lie beyond Avyakta, the Undifferentiated, to those regions where duality cannot and does not exist. As the knower of knowledge of the Vedas (man of knowledge) has no desire for all those coveted pleasures, the bliss of all creatures is his (Panchadasi XIV-34). Neither in Rajasika nor in Tamasika Vrittis the experience of Sukha (absolute bliss) is seen but in Sattvika Vrittis experience of \\"Absolute happiness\\" is seen to a greater or a lesser degree (Panchadasi XV-13). Whatever is experienced it is Brahman alone because it is a reflection of Brahman, when the Vritti is directed inward or is withdrawn, the reflection of Paramananda is unobstructed (Panchadasi XV-19). Adi Shankara in his commentary on Brahma Sutra III.iii.41 explains that the fact that Vamadeva while realizing this (Self) as That (Brahman) knew \\" I was Manu, and the sun \\" shows the result of knowledge, consisting in becoming identified with all, occurs simultaneously with the rise of complete illumination, hence liberation comes inevitably to a man of knowledge. And then, the stage - \\"avibhaagen drshtatvaata\\" (Brahma Sutra IV.iv.4) is reached, in liberation the soul exists in a state of inseparableness from the supreme Self, and the liberated soul \\"established in Infinity on Its own majesty delights in his own Self and disports in his own Self\\" (Chandogya Upanishad VII.xxv.2), \\"in that state which the knowers of Brahman call the highest the five senses of knowledge come to rest together with the mind weaned away from its functions of thinking etc;, and the intellect characterised by determination too does not function\\" (Katha Upanishad II.iii.10). Rishi Bandhvaduya Gopayanah (Rig Veda10.60.8) reminds that the mind is kept bound to the Jivatman not for the destruction of Prana and its associated aspects but for their protection, for on them depends life. But it is also true that the apparent universe having its roots in the mind does not persist after the mind is annihilated. The mind is annihilated when it is brought to concentrate on the Self with the view to transcend the whole objective universe in search of the identity of the Jiva and Brahman leading to Self-realisation and the consequent parallel enjoyment of eternal bliss, Parmananda .

Brides of Blood (DVD liner notes). Image Entertainment. ID146011DVD. It was the first movie that Ashley made in the Philippines, beginning a long association between Ashley and that country. Brides of Blood was the second in a series of four horror films produced by Romero and Kane W. Lynn known as the \\"Blood Island\\" series, which also included Terror Is a Man, The Mad Doctor of Blood Island and Beast of Blood. Brides of Blood was later released to television syndication in some areas as Island of Living Horror. Plot Three Americans arrive on a tropical island: Dr. Paul Henderson, a scientist investigating radiation from atomic bomb tests; his beautiful but sexually frustrated wife, Carla; and Jim Farrell, a young Peace Corps representative. The captain tells his passengers that the island is cursed and is known as \\"Blood Island\\". The trio comes upon a funeral procession being conducted by the local natives. The two bodies headed for burial have been completely dismembered. The Americans are greeted by Arcadio, the tribe's elder, and his granddaughter Alma. Alma acts as Jim's interpreter for the natives, but remains secretive about what has everyone on edge. The villagers choose two of the village maidens to participate in a ritual. The Americans are invited by Goro to visit the home of his master, Esteban Powers, a handsome young man who invites them to stay with him. Jim declines, but Carla insists that she and Paul stay. Esteban suffers from migraines, and reveals that the natives were all moved to the island after the atomic bomb tests; while they seem unaffected by the fallout, the flora and fauna of the island seem to have been altered. The group is startled to discover that the youthful-looking Esteban is actually 50 years old. On their way back to the village, a banana tree grabs Carla with its branches, but Jim and Paul rescue her. A butterfly transforms into a fanged monster and bites Paul on the hand. In the village, two women are shackled to an altar and stripped of their clothes. Inside a hut with Arcadio and Alma, the Americans hear a strange sound emanating from the jungle, but they are warned not to leave the hut. Outside, a deformed humanoid beast emerges from the jungle and dismembers the two naked women. The next morning, Alma tells Jim that the beast only wants women; the mutilations are its means of sexual satisfaction. She tells him that if they do not continue to sacrifice girls to the creature, it will go berserk and destroy them all. Paul realizes the animals on the island have the ability to change from their normal state into monstrous forms. The villagers select two more sacrifices by lottery; this time, Alma is chosen. Jim attempts to intervene, but Arcadio and the tribesmen tie him up. At Esteban's house, Carla desires sex, but can't get her husband interested. She sneaks down the hall to Esteban's bedroom, where she finds him writhing on his bed. When she tries to get into bed with him, his servant Goro appears and forces her to leave the room. While the villagers await the arrival of the beast, Jim escapes and rescues Alma by firing a flare gun at the creature before it can dismember her. The villagers are furious that Jim intervened, and chase Jim and Alma into the jungle. The duo flee through the monstrous vegetation and return to Esteban's house. Esteban tells them that he and his wife were exposed to radiation during the atomic bomb tests. While he only suffers with migraines, it caused his wife to suffer fatal seizures. That night, Carla sees Esteban stagger out of the house, and she follows him into the jungle, unaware that he is the beast of the island, a transformation he undergoes after each migraine. After an encounter with some monstrous trees and carnivorous plants, Carla is violently dismembered by the monster. Paul, Jim and Alma search for Carla. Goro chases them with a machete and kills Paul. Jim and Alma find some carnivorous trees devouring what is left of Carla's body. They return to the village, pursued by the monster. Jim convinces the villagers to fight the monster instead of appeasing it. They corner the creature in a grass hut and set it afire. The villagers watch as Esteban, back in human form, stumbles out of the hut and dies. The village celebrates their freedom by holding a love ritual. As the natives pair off and go into the jungle for some wild lovemaking, Alma becomes enraptured by the music as well, and selects Jim as her mate, and the two slip off into the jungle together.

It was shot in Premier Productions Studio in Manila and on location. with a budget of $75,000. The shoot was originally to run four weeks, but because the money kept running out, it ended up taking 11 weeks to complete. Ashley did not mind, however, since he got along well with Romero and the crew. If he was not paid, he would just stop working until his check came through.Tom Weaver, \\"Interview with John Ashley\\", Interviews with B Science Fiction and Horror Movie Makers: Writers, Producers, Directors, Actors, Moguls and Makeup, McFarland 1988 p. 40-41 Ashley said he was keen to accept the offer to make the movie because his marriage to Deborah Walley had just broken up and he wanted to get out of the United States.Weaver, p. 40 The film was known during filming as Orgy of Blood.https://archive.org/details/motionpictureexh75jaye/page/n419 Release The pressbook for Brides stated that all female theater patrons would be given the opportunity to \\"become a Bride of Blood and receive a free engagement ring set!\\". Each customer received a set of two cheap plastic rings. Sam Sherman came up with the wedding ring gimmick and tried to persuade Romero to add a phony printed marriage license to the package, but Lynn vetoed the idea, noting that the phony licenses could lead Hemisphere into unwanted legal situations involving minors, such as unwanted pregnancies.Sherman, Sam (2002). Brides of Blood (audio commentary track). Image Entertainment. ID146011DVD. Reception The movie was well received, doing particularly well in U.S. drive-ins. Ashley later said \\"the film did some business; they had some kind of gimmick with plastic wedding rings and things like that\\".Weaver p42 Its success led to two more \\"Blood Island\\" films, The Mad Doctor of Blood Island and Beast of Blood. Ashley actually moved to the Philippines in 1968, where he lived for the next few years, co-producing several horror films there in partnership with Romero and Roger Corman. The Los Angeles Times called it \\"stupid and shoddy in every aspect, but so ludicrous it's sometimes fun\\", and said that Hills \\"emerges vital and sexy\\". The Monthly Film Bulletin called it \\"not unworthy but formulistic\\". Diabolique magazine said Ashley was \\"solid and professional rather than outstanding, but he brings a believability that is vital in a movie with such an outlandish plot.\\" Hills later said that she had signed to shoot Queen of the Jungle in the Philippines with Ed Wood Jr. in July 1966, but the film was never made.

The site features fan art of Marvel character Hawkeye (Clint Barton) in various poses held by female characters that the artists believe to be impossible or sexually provocative. The site's intent is phrased as \\"to draw attention to how deformed, hypersexualized, and unrealistically dressed women are drawn in comics\\". The site further states that these poses are seen as normal and go unnoticed by many readers when performed by female superheroes. Origins A series of commentators had discussed the absurdity of the \\"Strong Female Superhero Pose\\" in 2011‚Äì2012, with some photographic gender-swapped recreations produced. The Hawkeye initiative page lists four blog posts on its 'Origins' page, including the suggestion of the specific formula by comic artist Noelle Stevenson in late 2012. The first such gender-swapped image was drawn by the comic artist Blue. The reason behind choosing Hawkeye in particular (though in the case of poses that involve more than one female character, Captain America and other well- known Avengers are also used) is due to the fact that Blue's first example involved swapping Black Widow and Hawkeye around on the cover of the eponymous comic. Stevenson and Blue then asked other artists to do the same. The Hawkeye Initiative website followed soon after, created and maintained by Skjaldmeyja.Internet pseudonym On December 5, 2018, the website's domain name expired and the site was taken down.  Critical reception In December 2012, The Daily Dot called Stevenson one of the \\"top 10 most influential fans of 2012\\" for her work in the Hawkeye Initiative. Reception Reception towards the website has been mixed. A few readers have criticized the site while others such as Gail Simone have openly supported the site as \\"the best thing in the history of historical anything ever in the universe or elsewhere\\". The A.V. Club commented that although the choice of Hawkeye was arbitrary, \\"making him the face of a feminist comic-book project fits with the character Matt Fraction has established in this series\\". The site's detractors have commented that some of the images are counterproductive to the site's intent. People have voiced that the images \\"miss the mark\\" by being played more for laughs or by being drawn sexy \\"for kicks, which may make it even harder for people to understand that it goes deeper than humor\\".

Upon leaving Blood Island, the ship carrying Dr. Bill Foster (John Ashley), Sheila Willard, her father and Carlos Lopez explodes and sinks after mutated \\"chlorophyll creature\\" Don Ramon Lopez (the titular \\"Beast\\") is found secreted on board and goes on a rampage, destroying the ship.

When Foster and Russell arrive on the island, they find the natives in a state of fear, believing that the old Lopez mansion is cursed.

The \\"green men\\" return and after a fight, Myra is captured and taken to the evil Dr. Lorca (Eddie Garcia), who is still alive, but horribly scarred from his seeming demise in the earlier film. Dr. Foster and Laida (Liza Belmonte) search the mountains and find Dr. Lorca's hidden lab. Laida goes back to the village for help and Lorca shows Foster his latest experiments. He has removed Don Ramon's head and has attached it to machines, while the decapitated body remains strapped to a table. Lorca knows the head can speak, but it refuses to say anything. The captain, Laida and Ramu lead an attack on Lorca's headquarters and fight with his men. Laida finds her father, who shows signs of the chlorophyll poisoning, and rescues him. Foster shoots Razak.

It marked Walter Brennan's final film role as he died over six months before the film's release. Plot In 1865, the American Civil War has just ended as the action in this work begins, following five Union soldiers - Pa Mondier, his two sons, and Smoky - as they return to their homes in the Ozarks of northern Arkansas, matter-of-factly planning a resumption of their pre-War existences. However, many residents from the village of Winslow and its surrounding region are averse to offering a helping hand to Yankees, Arkansas having been a member of the Confederacy. Mort Fagan leads some ex-Confederate soldiers in an attack against the former Unionists, resulting in Pa Mondier being mortally wounded, triggering a feud. Some Winslow citizens are working to close the nation's divisiveness and it is to them that the returning veterans must look for support.

The General Store and most of the town was not modified for the film. The script was by Eric Allen, a journalist and Western author. The film was made by two stuntmen turned producers, Billy and White Hughes. They were from Arkansas and White Hughes had doubled for John Ashley a number of times. Ashley says the brothers \\"went back to Arkansas and promoted a bunch of turkey ranchers to put up some money, I think about $400,000. They did this on the basis of them being able to deliver Walter Brennan.\\" Ashley says Brennan agreed to make the film if his son Andy would direct. John Ashley knew the Hugheses and agreed to be in it because he wanted to work with Brennan. \\" I'd do it for nothing, but if I committed to it and it turned out that they didn't have him I'd walk out,\\" said Ashley. He says they got a gaffer, Mario Tosi, to work on the film by giving him the opportunity to be cinematographer. Ashley made it shortly after Beast of the Yellow Night. According to Ashley filming was difficult and Andy Brennan \\"had some personal problems. And it was not going well\\". The Hughes brothers replaced him with Joe Kane. Walter Brennan stayed on the film even though he was ill with emphysema at the time. Ashley says the filmmakers ran out of money after filming was completed; Whitey Hughes eventually raised the money to complete it. \\"I was so impressed with Walter, said Ashley. \\"He hung in there. He got to know these ranchers, and they would hang out at this trailer. He had done this movie for his son, but he wouldn't walk off the movie. ... Any moment that I had, that I wasn't in front of the camera, I would go sit in his trailer and ask him questions about the old days, he was a great story teller. That's the whole reason I did the movie. I would have paid them to hang out with this guy.\\" Ashley later said he was not happy being billed over Brennan.

That territory was unnamed until 2012, though most of it was unofficially known as Edith Ronne Land in 1947‚Äì68Ronne Ice Shelf. USGS Geographic Names Information System and includes areas claimed by the United Kingdom, Chile and Argentina. Map of Queen Elizabeth Land (shaded)  History  The glacier flowing from the Pensacola Mountains onto the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf On the occasion of a visit by Queen Elizabeth II to the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office in London on 18 December 2012, it was announced there that a area of the British Antarctic Territory had been named Queen Elizabeth Land after The Queen. The Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, William Hague, said that the naming was \\"a fitting tribute at the end of Her Majesty's Diamond Jubilee year\\". Queen Elizabeth Land is nearly twice the size of the United Kingdom and is essentially a triangular segment of Antarctica, with one vertex at the South Pole. It is bounded on the North side by the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf, to the North East by Coats Land, on the East by Queen Maud Land and extending on the West side to a line between the South Pole and Rutford Ice Stream, east of Constellation Inlet.Queen Elizabeth Land, Foreign & Commonwealth Office. Retrieved 19 December 2012 The Pensacola Mountains, discovered in January 1956, run for some along a north-east to south-west line along the centre of the territory. The area's name will be included on all British maps. Queen Elizabeth Land is the second region of Antarctica to be named in honour of Queen Elizabeth II. The first is Princess Elizabeth Land, located across the continent in the Australian Antarctic Territory, which was named in 1931 in honour of then- Princess Elizabeth during the reign of her grandfather George V as King of Australia.  Reaction  Argentina, whose Argentine Antarctica claim overlaps with the British Antarctic Territory, criticised the naming calling it a \\"systematic attack\\" and described it as \\"provocation\\" after recent tensions over Argentina's claim to the sovereignty of the Falkland Islands, a British Overseas Territory. The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement regarding the naming, where they reminded that Russia was one of the original parties to the Antarctic Treaty signed in 1959 and calling for the full, unconditional and responsible compliance by all State parties with its provisions (which included the UK). According to the Russians, \\"no acts or activities taking place while the present Treaty is in force shall constitute a basis for asserting, supporting or denying a claim to territorial in Antarctica and do not create any rights of sovereignty in Antarctica\\".

Included in his achievements was the creation of a ‚Ç¨750mln Equity and Loans Emerging Market Investment Fund financing entrepreneurs with little access to finance. Very much committed to a sustainable economy, Jan Vos worked consistently towards a safer national and international environment. He oversaw an ‚Ç¨11bln investment in renewable energy, and with his party in government, succeeded in phasing out Dutch coal plants by 2030, thus realizing significant real change. The Netherlands is now building the largest offshore wind park in the world, made possible by legislation passed during his tenure. Furthermore, Dutch Parliament voted in favor of his progressive motions to only allow sales of zero-emission cars in the Netherlands in 2030. This is now government policy. Following several earthquakes with increasing intensity and frequency in the northernmost parts of the Netherlands (Groningen), Vos introduced a number of motions and amendments to decrease gas-drilling operations, thereby making the Groningen field area significantly safer for residents. As a result of his legislation, several avenues have now been provided to compensate for damages suffered by the communities. Vos has also taken legislative measures to ensure that new gas drilling in the national park ‚ÄòWaddenzee‚Äô is banned. Well acquainted with the media early in his career, he has frequently appeared on most Dutch news programs, hosted a TV documentary on the United Nations, and has made appearances as a radio talk show panel member engaged in weekly discussions on current events and politics.

Her artistic style is both neoclassical and postmodern. Her art mainly focuses on the human figure, and is often psychological in nature with narratives expressed across multiple layers. Career  Sculpture  \\"The common thread in her work is its emotional strength, gestural qualities, layered textures, and the centrality of the human figure or the experience of being human.\\" She often explores making invisible concepts visible: people in the act of thinking, narratives wherein something is hidden or revealed, and daily cycles of life against longer cycles of geologic or celestial time. \\"She is fascinated by the power of the human figure as it reaches monumental size, when it crosses the boundary and projects energy into an individual‚Äôs psychological space, when the art becomes participatory.\\" By infusing the making of the art into the art, she captures a specific ‚Äòmoment in time‚Äô that contrasts deep rhythms and underlying forces. Her desire, conceptually parallel to different tempos of time outlined by historian Fernand Braudel, is to capture these human moments within the larger context of universal humanity.  Environmental Sculpture  \\"Solstice Ellipse\\" from Memory Diaries Art Installation, 2013 Borcherding‚Äôs site-specific environmental sculpture pushes the space relationship between object and observer even further so that the observer walks into and on the art. ‚ÄúWhen I came down here I had lots of sketches and ideas,‚Äù says Borcherding, an art professor at Sam Houston State University in Huntsville, Texas. \\"But then you quickly realize you can impose or you can take what‚Äôs here and run with it. So right now I‚Äôm chasing the project, rather than imposing.‚Äù With waders on, Borcherding creates many of her tall sculptures in the water. ‚ÄúThey can stand on their own like a piece of art in the water, like it‚Äôs matted and framed,‚Äù she says. The marrying of natural elements with man-made organization also fascinates the artist. ‚ÄúAs you change the edge to man-made and then let it go back to nature, it creates these natural punctuation marks or pauses. It‚Äôs interesting to see how far you have to go to create contrast.‚Äù \\"You have the idea in your head but you can‚Äôt work on a grand scale, you just have to start. You start by placing objects ‚Ä¶ it is almost as if you are sketching out. And then you have to use the space as a catalyst. What makes an environmental art piece successful since it is on a grand scale and you as the viewer walk on to the piece, you are surrounded by the piece, you walk over the piece and you participate with it, so it becomes this full body experience that you have, which is different than you have if you would view just front on a sculpture or in the round in a gallery.\\"  Ceramics  Her ceramic work focuses on the creation of assemblages incorporating either the human form or a personification of an object. She makes use of visual symbols which she extracts and extends from the direct observation of an environment including important cultural, architectural or technological representations. Projecting the object into the observers‚Äô psychological space compels observers to ‚Äúdive in‚Äù with their own humanity as an emotive participant in order to unfold the inner narrative of the art. Through this re-living of an inner world of an important period and place a universal moment from the past becomes alive.  Print work  Male Portrait with Sun, 2009 Borcherding's print work is described as ‚Äúdirect, strongly graphic, sinewy and somewhat raw and rough images with a strong clear component of feeling in the content or depiction‚Äù. Biographical Borcherding's long studio career in visual arts is complemented with a commitment to art education which she fulfills through printmaking, ceramic and life drawing workshops. She is currently developing a drawing and anatomy curriculum for online education under the moniker ‚ÄúArt Team‚Äù. She is also an art professor at Sam Houston State University, where she has been employed since 1993. During the academic year she lives on a working horse and cattle ranch in Texas. Summers are enjoyed in and around Madison, Wisconsin.

The following year, Kangni reached her breakthrough season by breaking both a national record and a personal best of 52.50 seconds at the 2003 IAAF World Championships in Saint-Denis, France. Kangni followed her father's footsteps by competing for the women's 400 metres at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens.

He spent his early childhood in China and went to school in London, Wiltshire and Worcestershire. He completed professional training for a Teachers‚Äô Certificate in 1946/7 and then took up a teaching post in Reading. It was at this time that he took up serious birdwatching and joined the British Ornithologists‚Äô Union, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and, a year later, the British Trust for Ornithology. During a period of National Service from 1948-50 Simmons was posted to the Suez Canal Zone, Egypt where his observations of birds provided material for later published work. From 1947 onwards he published many notes and papers on birds. He became particularly interested in the taxonomic implications of certain simple behaviour patterns and in bird taxonomy generally and was listed in the 1961 Directory of Zoological Taxonomists. He was also a committee member, joint recorder and Chairman of the Reading Ornithological Club. In February 1962 he moved to Ascension Island, as the island School Master, with his wife Marion as his assistant. Although he had intended to spend his spare time on the island writing, he ended spending most of it observing and studying the brown booby Sula leucogaster. Upon their return to England in 1964 both Ken and Marion decided to give up teaching and Ken succeeded in obtaining a Leverhulme Fellowship enabling him to register, in 1965, as a postgraduate student at the Department of Psychology, University of Bristol. In 1967 he was awarded an MSc for his Ascension Island booby studies and in 1970 a PhD for work on the great crested grebe. Simmons' work was widely cited in ornithological circles.Seabird Group Journal While in Bristol he was a founding committee member of the Bristol Ornithological Club. Following his PhD he moved to Leicester to work with Uli Weidmann at the Department of Psychology, University of Leicester on duck courtship. He was also asked to join the Editorial Board of The Birds of the Western Palearctic. He started work on the Social Pattern and Behaviour section in late 1971, in 1973 he became editor, reducing the hours worked at the University of Leicester, then in 1975 SRC funding allowed him to work full-time on The Birds of the Western Palearctic. He was responsible for the Voice section, the Family Summaries and general trouble shooting. He also spent time writing papers and books and biographical study of Edmund Selous.

Located between Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, Perry's Camp was one of the first tourist courts in the area that has since become a tourist mecca. Perry's Camp preceded the founding of the adjacent Great Smoky Mountains National Park by six years. The site originally included a restaurant with living quarters upstairs and eleven cabins, including one log and stone house already on the site from the 1850s. The site has been owned and operated by the Mack Marshall family since 1952. Three of the remaining four cabins are still rented to tourists April through October. Location Perry's Camp was originally located on both sides of the West Fork of the Little Pigeon River about halfway between Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge where Flat Branch joins the river. The structures closest to the river were demolished when US-441 was widened in the late 1950s. The remaining structures of Perry's Camp are now all located on the west side of the river near the base of Flat Branch road where it joins southbound US-441 adjacent to the middle bridge which spans the northbound and southbound lanes. History Disabled moonshine still used by Charlie Perry to attract tourists In c. 1928, Charlie Perry began developing Perry's Camp as a tourist resort, continuing to expand the site over the next twenty years. Perry was very innovative and visionary, and included many interesting artifacts in his development. A dam across the river diverted water through a powerhouse which generated electricity for the resort. A swinging bridge provided the only access to cabins on the east side of the river. Employee of Charlie Perry. A disabled moonshine still hung outside the restaurant for advertisement. A water wheel turned a fan in the dining room. A hollowed-out log covered with glass and filled with water and fish served as a bar in the restaurant. A garage dug into the side of a hill housed Perry's car. Many rock walls were constructed, including a two-level terraced rock wall and rock walls for containing a section of Flat Branch. A portion of the two-level terraced rock wall built by Charlie Perry In 1949, Charlie Perry and his common-law wife Josie Law were brutally murdered and robbed in the restaurant of Perry's Camp as documented in the book \\"The Perry's Camp Murders\\" by R.S. Allen with Steve O. Watson, published in August, 2009. In 1950, following the settlement of the estate, Sevierville businessman Cliff Davis purchased the property and operated it for a couple of years, converting the restaurant into a gift shop. In 1952, the property was purchased by Mack and Agnes Marshall who reopened the restaurant and continued to rent the cabins. Prompted by the ever-increasing tourist traffic to the national park, US 441 was improved and widened in the late 1950s, taking with it the restaurant building, the dam, the swinging bridge, and the six cabins nearest the river. Ceiling fan formerly in dining room of the house at Perry's Camp At that time, the wormy chestnut wood from the restaurant walls was salvaged and used for the ceiling in the log house, the ceiling fan was placed on the porch of the log house, and the water wheel was moved from behind the restaurant up the hill to its current location. The water wheel was restored c. 1955 using red-painted plywood sides and aluminum buckets, and it was restored again in October 2012 with more historically accurate white oak sides and buckets. Perry's camp was one of the first tourist sites in East Tennessee and one of very few which has retained much of its construction originality in the four cabins and log house which still exist. As a result, Perry's Camp was entered on the National Register of Historic Places on October 30, 1992. The listing includes the terracing, rock walls, four cabins, and log house. The site is now named Flat Branch Cottages, and three of the four cabins are still rented to tourists April through October. The site has been owned and operated by the Mack Marshall family since 1952. Flat Branch Cottages  References   External links  * -- website for the 2009 R.S. Allen and Steve O.

He was arrested several times by the British police. In 1933, he died in a prison located in Ranchi, India. As a student, Sengupta travelled to England, where he studied law at Downing College, Cambridge. During his stay there, he met and married Edith Ellen Gray, later known as Nellie Sengupta. After returning to India, he started a legal practice. He also joined in Indian politics, becoming a member of the Indian National Congress and participating in the Non-Cooperation Movement. Eventually, he gave up his legal practice in favour of his political commitment.  Early life  Nellie and Jatindra Mohan Sengupta on a 1985 stamp of India Jatindra Mohan Sengupta was born on 22 February 1885 to a prominent land-owning (Zamindar) family of Barama, in Chittagong district of British India (now in Chittagong, Bangladesh). His father, Jatra Mohan Sengupta, was an advocate and a member of the Bengal Legislative Council. Sengupta became a student of the Presidency College in Calcutta. After completing his university studies, he went to England in 1904 to acquire a bachelor's degree in Law. While in England, he met his future wife, Edith Ellen Gray, who is now better known as Nellie Sengupta.  Career  After being awarded his degree in law, Sengupta was called to the Bar in England then returned with his wife to India, where he began practicing law as a barrister. In 1911, he represented Chittagong in the Bengal Provincial Conference at Faridpur. This was the beginning of his political career. Later, he joined the Indian National Congress. He also organised the employees of the Burmah Oil Company to form a union. In 1921, Sengupta became the Chairman of the Bengal Reception Committees of the Indian National Congress. That same year, during a strike at the Burmah Oil Company, he was also serving as the secretary of the employees' union. He abandoned his legal practise due to his commitment to political work, particularly related to the Non-Cooperation Movement led by Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi. In 1923, he was selected as a member of the Bengal Legislative Council. In 1925, after the death of Chitta Ranjan Das, Sengupta was elected president of the Bengal Swaraj Party. He also became president of the Bengal Provincial Congress Committee. He was mayor of Calcutta from 10 April 1929 to 29 April 1930. In March 1930, at a public meeting in Rangoon, he was arrested on charges of provoking people against the Government and opposing the India‚ÄìBurma separation. In 1931, Sengupta went to England to attend the Round Table Conference, supporting the position of the Indian National Congress. He submitted pictures of police atrocities committed by the British to control the Chittagong rebellion, which shook the British Government.  Death  Sengupta was repeatedly arrested due to his political activities. In January 1932, he was arrested and detained in Poona and then in Darjeeling. Later, he was transferred to prison in Ranchi. There, his health started to decline and he died on 23 July 1933.  Influence  Because of his popularity and contribution to the Indian freedom movement, Jatindra Mohan Sengupta is affectionately remembered by people of Bengal with the honorific Deshpriya or Deshapriya, meaning \\"beloved of the country\\". In many criminal cases he defended the nationalist revolutionaries in the court and saved them from the gallows. He pled for Surya Sen, Ananta Singh, Ambika Chakrabarty in the Pahartali trial and also saved a young revolutionary, Premananda Dutta, who had been accused in the case relating to the murder of Inspector Prafulla Chakraborty. In 1985, a postal stamp was issued by the Indian Government in memory of Sengupta and his wife, Nellie.

First modernization Many of the details of the modernizations made before the fascist invasion during the Second Italo‚ÄìEthiopian War are written in Haile Selassie I's autobiography, My Life and Ethiopia's Progress Vol. I (written 1938), particularly in Chapter 12, \\"About the improvement, by ordinance and proclamation, of internal administration, and about the efforts to allow foreign civilization to enter Ethiopia\\". Among the efforts of his program as he listed them in the chapter: * Establishment of electrical grids in major cities beginning in 1916 * Curbing of hereditary feudal rule of nobility in remote provinces, and substitution of merit-based appointees, from 1917 * Establishment of a military college and the Ethiopia Scout Association movement from 1918 * Establishment of Cabinet Ministries from 1920, based on European models * Revision of judicial system; appointment of special courts for cases involving foreigners in 1920; ending outdated punishments mandated in the 500-year-old Fetha Nagast law code, such as amputation of hands for conviction of thefs by Imperial Proclamation in 1921; establishment of a modern Criminal Code in 1930. As a result, in Haile Selassie's words, \\"Justice now took a road that had honour.\\" * Establishment of printing presses from 1921 * Maximum legal interest rate set at 9% in 1921; usurers had charged up to 30%. * Widespread introduction of cars, motorcycles, trucks and bicycles from 1922 * Establishment of modern hospitals in major cities from 1922 * Establishment of foreign language schools in major cities from 1924 * Establishment of a properly maintained system of roads linking cities from about 1925 * Introduction of a national anthem (the Marche Tafari) in 1927 * Establishment of the National Bank of Ethiopia in 1927 * Introduction of airplanes in 1927 * Establishment of Ethiopian embassies and consulates in foreign countries from 1928 * Appointment of five native Ethiopian Orthodox Bishops in 1928. Previously native Ethiopians were never allowed to become bishops by the governing Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, but in discussions, the Emperor won this concession by stressing that \\"believers in Christ are not such by innate distinctness, but by virtue of conduct.\\" * Abolition of the lebasha, a backwards superstition where travelling charlatans would claim the ability to find a thief by administering potent drugs to a small boy, and then charging whomever the boy attacked, with theft. \\"Consequently, there was great rejoicing in every province, as We had protected the people from the iniquities that came upon them in this matter.\\" * Establishment of the 1931 Constitution of Ethiopia, Ethiopia's first modern Constitution * Establishment of telephone and wireless services throughout Ethiopia from 1931 * Establishment of a modern prison facility in 1932 Modernization was temporarily interrupted in 1935 following the invasion of Ethiopia by fascist Italy, eventually culminating in the Second World War. As the Emperor himself noted in his Introduction to Volume I, \\"We were particularly convinced, by the policies directed against Us, that the enemy's heart was stricken with envy at Our setting up a constitution to strengthen and to consolidate Ethiopia's unity, at Our opening schools for boys and girls, at Our building hospitals in which Our people's health was to be safeguarded, as well as at all sorts of other initiatives of Ours by which Ethiopia's independence would be affirmed, not only in terms of history but in actual fact.\\" Abolition of slavery Slavery as practiced in what is modern Ethiopia and Eritrea was essentially domestic. Slaves thus served in the houses of their masters or mistresses and were not employed to any significant extent for productive purpose. Among the Amhara and Tigray slaves were normally regarded as second-class members of their owners' family. and were fed, clothed and protected. They generally roamed around freely and conducted business as free people. They had complete freedom of religion and culture. The first attempt to abolish slavery in Ethiopia was made by Emperor Tewodros II (r. 1855‚Äì1868), but the slave trade was not abolished completely until 1923 with Ethiopia's accession to the League of Nations.Kituo cha katiba >> Haile Selassie Profile The Anti-Slavery Society estimated there were 2 million slaves in the early 1930s out of an estimated population of between 8 and 16 million. He described in the whole of Chapter 14 his efforts to eradicate slavery, which he noted was a persistent custom in Ethiopia arising from intertribal wars, where the captured slaves could hardly be distinguished in appearance from their owners and sometimes even married them. The slave trade had already been banned unsuccessfully by his predecessors Tewodros II, Yohannes IV and Menelik II. Beginning in 1924, Haile Selassie I began doing everything possible to liberate all remaining slaves in Ethiopia, enrolling many of them in education programs. Despite all this, Haile Selassie asserted that Benito Mussolini's propaganda agents (Haile Selassie singled out the Italian consul at Harar in particular) were constantly broadcasting to the world many false reports that slavery was still being promoted in Ethiopia, in an attempt to influence world opinion against Ethiopia, have Ethiopia indicted in the League of Nations, and create a casus belli for the invasion, genocide, and attempted recolonization of Ethiopia with Italians. :\\"Again, when in 1923 (= 1931) a delegation, sent by the British Anti-Slavery Society, came to Addis Ababa, We informed them orally and in writing, after a great deal of discussion, that We shall see to it that within fifteen or, at most, twenty years from now all slaves would go free and that slavery would be totally eliminated from Ethiopia. But in any country a few offenders must always be expected, and if some men are found transgressing the proclamation that has been promulgated, all the foreign envoys know that We have punished them even with the death penalty. Therefore, Our conscience does not rebuke Us, for We have done unceasingly everything possible as regards the liberation of the slaves.\\" The institution of slavery was again abolished by order of the Italian occupying forces. On 26 August 1942, during the Second Modernization, Haile Selassie issued a proclamation completely outlawing all slavery. Second modernization Following the Second World War, Haile Selassie opened Ethiopia's first university. The University College of Addis Ababa was founded in 1950. In 1962, it was renamed Haile Selassie I University but is currently known as Addis Ababa University. In 1955, the 1931 Constitution of Ethiopia was replaced with the 1955 Constitution of Ethiopia, extending the power of Parliament. Haile Selassie improved diplomatic ties with the United States, as well as Ethiopia's relationship with the rest of Africa. He initiated the Organization of African Unity in 1963.

Hieronymus painted art galleries and Kunstkammer, genre scenes of elegant balls and dances, history paintings, monkey scenes (the so-called singeries), allegorical paintings and still lifes. He also copied some of the scenes of witches and witchcraft, including portrayals of witches' sabbats, invented by his brother Frans II.Thomas Christensen, 1616: The World in Motion, Counterpoint Press, 2012, p. 234 Festive Company As the paintings of various members of the Francken family were so similar in style and they rarely signed their work, it has been difficult for a long time to identify the works by Hieronymus II. In particular the works of Hieronymus II and Frans II have been difficult to distinguish as they had a similar training and worked in close proximity and as a result their figure style and subject matter is very similar. Various works of Hieronymus II were in the past attributed to his brother. On the basis of the few signed works by his hand historians have been able to reconstruct Hieronymus' oeuvre and re-attribute to him a number of works.Ursula H√§rting. \\"Francken: (4) Hieronymus Francken II\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 19 Feb. 2015 Typical characteristics of Hieronymus' work are the use of broad brush strokes and earth colours, such as brick-red and variations of brown tones. The scale of his figures is occasionally awkward. Elegant balls Hieronymus as well as his brother Frans the Younger created many paintings depicting elegant balls. They typically represent anonymous events where couples or larger groups of elegant persons are dancing on music in an interior. It is possible that the brothers developed this subject under the influence of their uncle Hieronymus Francken I under whom they may have studied briefly during a presumed residence in Paris. Hieronymus I had developed this genre of elegant balls while working for the French court in Fontainebleau and Paris. The execution of these works by both brothers is similar in style. The architecture in these paintings was occasionally the work of another painter such as Paul Vredeman de Vries in the case of the work Elegant company in the Kunsthistorisches Museum.Hieronymus Francken (II) and Paul Vredeman de Vries, Gesellschaftsszene at the Kunsthistorisches Museum Still lifes Rich and the Poor at Table Some of the most original work of Hieronymus II was in the area of still lifes. He specialized in monochrome banquet still lifes typically of simple food and pottery. Gradually an oeuvre is being ascribed to him on the basis of his sole signed still life referred to as Still life with pottery, herring and pancakes, a print of an owl on the wall or Rich and the Poor at Table in the collection of the Royal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp dated 1604. Another still life in the Royal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp referred to as the Poor Man's Meal has been attributed to Hieronymus II. A very similar work was sold at Christie's on 17 May 2004 in Amsterdam as lot 72. There exists a third similar work in a private collection.Hieronymus Francken (II), Stilleven met aardewerk, haring en pannekoeken; rechts een doorkijk naar een paar in een landschap met galg en molen, 1599?, Private collection, at the Netherlands Institute for Art History It is believed that this composition Poor Man's Meal is a pendant to a composition representing a Rich Man's Meal of which there is only one copy preserved in a private collection.S. Segal, A prosperous past. The sumptuous still life in the Netherlands 1600-1700, Den Haag 1988, p. 227 Gallery paintings Frans Francken the Younger and Jan Brueghel the Elder were the first artists to create paintings of art and curiosity collections in the 1620s.Susan Merriam, Seventeenth-Century Flemish Garland Paintings. Still Life, Vision and the Devotional Image, Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2012 Gallery paintings depict large rooms in which many paintings and other precious items are displayed in elegant surroundings. The earliest works in this genre depicted art objects together with other items such as scientific instruments or peculiar natural specimens. Some gallery paintings include portraits of the owners or collectors of the art objects or artists at work.Alexander Marr, 'The Flemish 'Pictures of Collections' Genre: An Overview', Intellectual History Review, 20: 1, (2010), p. 5 ‚Äî 25 The genre became immediately quite popular and was followed by other artists such as Jan Brueghel the Younger, Cornelis de Baellieur, Hans Jordaens, David Teniers the Younger, Gillis van Tilborch and Hieronymus Janssens. A Collector's Cabinet, Sotheby's Hieronymus II created a number of gallery paintings. Only one of these, the composition referred to as The Cabinet of an Art Lover or The Art Gallery of Jan Snellinck (Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium) is signed and dated 1621. This painting has been the basis for the attribution to Hieronymus of a number of gallery paintings formerly attributed to other artists such as his brother Frans II and Adriaen van Stalbemt. The best known of these pictures is The Archdukes Albert and Isabella Visiting a Collector's Cabinet, which is now generally regarded as a collaboration between Jan Brueghel the Elder and Hieronymus Francken II even though some see the hand of van Stalbemt here too.Hieronymus Francken (II), A Collector's Cabinet at Sotheby's It is part of the collection of The Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, Maryland. Other cabinet paintings that were formerly attributed to van Stalbemt have also been re- attributed to Hieronymus. This includes the composition The Sciences and Arts and the reduced replica of the lower right hand corner called The Geographer and the Naturalist (both in the Prado). A Collector's Cabinet, which is similar to the paintings in the Prado, was sold at Sotheby's on 9 July 2014 as lot 57. What the three compositions The Archdukes Albert and Isabella Visiting a Collector's Cabinet, The Sciences and Arts and A Collector's Cabinet have in common is that they give prominence among the artworks included in the gallery painting to compositions that are allegories of iconoclasm and the victory of painting (art) over ignorance. These are references to the iconoclasm of the Beeldenstorm that had raged in the Low Countries in the 16th century and the victory over the iconoclasts during the reign of the Archdukes Albert and Isabella who jointly ruled the Spanish Netherlands in the beginning of the 17th century.Adriaen van Stalbent, Las Ciencias y las Artes at the PradoJames Simpson, Under the Hammer: Iconoclasm in the Anglo-American Tradition, Oxford University Press, 2010 Hieronymus' gallery paintings represent the early phase of the genre of collector's cabinets. During this early 'encyclopaedic' phase, the genre reflected the culture of curiosity of that time, when art works, scientific instruments, naturalia and artificialia were equally the object of study and admiration. As a result, the cabinets depicted in these compositions are populated by persons who appear to be as interested in discussing scientific instruments as in admiring paintings. Later the genre concentrated more on galleries solely containing works of art. Even though one of Hieronymus' gallery paintings was earlier believed to represent the real art gallery of the Flemish artist and collector Jan Snellinck it is now believed that all his galleries are in fact imaginary. The identity of the painters who painted the figures in Hieronymus' gallery pictures is not known. Singeries Bathroom with monkeys and cats Hieronymus' brother Frans the Younger had contributed to the development of the genre of the 'monkey scene', also called 'singerie' (a word, which in French means a 'comical grimace, behaviour or trick').'Singerie' in Larousse online Comical scenes with monkeys appearing in human attire and a human environment are a pictorial genre that was initiated in Flemish painting in the 16th century and was subsequently further developed in the 17th century. The Flemish engraver Pieter van der Borcht introduced the singerie as an independent theme around 1575 in a series of prints, which are strongly embedded in the artistic tradition of Pieter Bruegel the Elder. These prints were widely disseminated and the theme was then picked up by other Flemish artists. The first one to do so was Frans Francken the Younger who played an important role in the development of the genre. David Teniers the Younger became the principal practitioner of the genre and developed it further with his younger brother Abraham Teniers. Later in the 17th century Nicolaes van Verendael started to paint these 'monkey scenes' as well.Bert Schepers, Monkey Madness in Seventeenth-Century Antwerp, in: The Rubenianum Quarterly, 2012 2, p. 5 Like his brother, Hieronymus II is known to have created singeries such as the Bathroom with monkeys and cats (Staatliches Museum Schwerin).

This terminology is used as distinct from a traditional Picture Archiving and Communications Systems (PACS), although there is debate about where the boundary between a VNA and a PACS lies along the continuum of their common features. Definition The simplest definition is \\"a medical device that stores medical images in a standard format with a standard interface, such that they can be accessed in a vendor-neutral manner by other systems\\". So-called \\"vendor neutrality\\" is implied by the standard format and interface, and the neutrality is with respect to vendor-specific devices that produce or consume those images (e.g., for display, distribution or analysis, with or without specific workflows, such as for radiology reporting, i.e., a PACS). The exact definition and feature set is contentious though, and evolves as different vendors of VNAs attempt to distinguish themselves from their competitors and avoid being excluded, and customers express desires ranging from pragmatic to fantastic. There is general agreement on the following key features: * Storage of DICOM images and related composite objects (presentation states, key objects, structured reports) * DICOM network standard interface for storage, query and retrieval * Administrative updates and corrections (patient ID changes and study merges) * Scalability Each of the following features remain contentious, in the sense that some customers and vendors claim that some or all are fundamental to the concept, but others disagree: * Storage of objects not directly related to images (such as human-generated requests and reports) * Storage of non-DICOM content (such as HL7 CDA documents) * Non-DICOM access protocols (such as IHE Cross-Enterprise Document Sharing (XDS and XDS-I) * Cross-domain identity and code resolution (patient ID, accession #, procedure codes) * Dynamic DICOM tag morphing * Information lifecycle management * Exclusion of workflow management database content * Independence from choice of database engine * Audit trail of access History Evolution Traditionally, the need to store medical images has been most common in the radiology and nuclear medicine departments, and has been implemented in the form of sub-specialty and departmental (PACS), which have combined the functions of image management and image archiving into a single solution. Whilst such systems all have standard interfaces (DICOM and IHE) for ingestion and distribution of images over the network and on physical media (like CD), typically the workflow and optimal performance for display are achieved using proprietary software and protocols. Further, the persistent storage \\"inside\\" a proprietary PACS may not be in a standard form, the PACS may not update the stored files with the latest study and demographic updates and annotations stored in the database, and it may extend, abuse or depend on specific standard and non-standard (private) DICOM attributes in the stored files. Over time, in many implementations, the underlying storage infrastructure has been \\"factored\\" out of the traditional (PACS) at the hardware and file system (DAS, NAS, SAN) level, and are supplied instead by non-domain-specific computer data storage vendors. As more medical specialties incorporate images in their practice, the need to extend image storage and distribution capability to other departments, enterprise wide. Increasingly there is a desire to inter- operate at a higher application level, separating departmental-specific workflows, display and analysis solutions from image storage infrastructure, using standard protocols that are image and metadata aware, without sacrificing display performance. A complicating factor is that the (PACS) offerings are in a constant state of flux with respect to features and quality of service, and traditionally users will abandon one vendor and replace their product with another's every 3‚Äì5 years. This triggers the need to \\"migrate\\" the images and associated information to the new architecture without data loss, a non-trivial task despite the use of standard formats for image encoding. The concept of a VNA theoretically allows for greater stability (re- usability and less frequent migration) at the archive level, despite rapid evolution and change at the higher application-level (display and workflow). Of course, migrating from one vendor's VNA to another isn't trivial either, just hopefully less frequent. An alternative term for a VNA is a \\"PACS Neutral Archive\\", which perhaps better conveys the original intent, but this term is rarely used, and for better or for worse, VNA has become the buzzword of choice amongst customers and salesmen. Literature As noted above, the archive of images is naturally mostly static‚Äîthat is, most of the content of an archive is unchanged, with only a (relatively) small number of studies added each day, with few changes and corrections required. From the early days of PACS, it was expected that standard interoperability boundaries would need to be defined. The ACR-NEMA, and later DICOM, standards arose to address not only the need for a standard file format but also protocols for storage of images from acquisition modalities to archives, and to query and retrieve images from the archive. Even the first ACR-NEMA standard from 1985 defined FIND and GET transactions. I.e., the separation of workstations and workflow management from archives was envisaged from the beginning. The first DICOM demonstrations at RSNA beginning in 1992 made use of a so-called \\"central test node\\", which arguably was one of the first DICOM-based vendor neutral archives, though that label was not in use at the time. Homegrown PACS or mini-PACS typically described the archive and workstation as separate entities. Many, but not all, monolithic commercial PACS continued to make use of proprietary protocols between their integrated workstations and archives, but the need to support separate third-party workstations for specialized work, such as 3D processing and radiotherapy planning, was always recognized, and implemented using the DICOM protocol. In 1998, Erickson and Hangiandreou discussed the advantages of once again separating the archive functionality from the conventional monolithic PACS and making use of pre-fetching to populate the \\"interpretation storage device\\". They also describe query and retrieval from multiple archives (in a manner that would now be called a federated query) to provide inter-enterprise image sharing. The article noted some of the practical challenges at the time, such as the relative inefficiency of doing DICOM queries against such multiple archives and separating out those responses relevant for pre-fetching, as well as challenges of patient identifiers. Nevertheless, the ability to have images in a separate system from the workstation was felt to be an important capability. Ultimately, Erickson and colleagues developed this into a startup company, TeraMedica in 2000, which was purchased by Fuji Medical Systems in 2015. In one of many blog entries on the subject, Michael Gray makes a reference to an early description of the concept of separating the front-end clinical applications from the back-end storage function, in an article by Nadim Daher, a Medical Imaging Market Analyst at Frost & Sullivan. A long running Aunt Minnie PACS Forum thread digressed to discuss the issue of neutral archives amongst a broader audience after a response from Michael Gray. A white paper from 2009 by Wayne DeJarnette is an early attempt to establish a definition based on a required feature set, and his company has also provided a more recent interpretation. Michael Gray offers his essential ingredients of a VNA in his 2009 blog entry, making reference to Acuo's checklist of attributes, the most recent form of which can be found in Shannon Werb's white paper on attributes of a \\"true\\" VNA. Herman Oosterwijk provides a more recent description on behalf of Teramedica, in his white paper, in which he offers a more detailed definition: \\"A Vendor Neutral Archive (VNA) is a medical device that provides scalable image and information and life cycle management so that images and related information can be queried, stored, and retrieved in a manner that is defined by open standards at multiple department, enterprise, and regional level while maintaining patient privacy and security. Characteristic for a VNA is that it provides a patient-centric approach that transcends upgrades and changes of the different viewing, acquisition, and workflow management components as they should be interchangeable without having to migrate, convert, or change the data formats or interface of the VNA.\\" The relationship of VNA to storage of medical images in the cloud is also nebulous, though offers high potential for buzzword compliance, and Michael Gray provides some clarity in his paper commissioned by EMC. Various alternative deployment models and frameworks have been described, which address matters of cost, value and barriers to entry. Since the term \\"VNA\\" has been so abused as a marketing term, it has already achieved mythical status. Features Administrative updates and corrections A passive archive will simply store what it receives, and potentially overwrite the same thing when it is received again with changes but the same (unique) identifiers. This is insufficient in a production operation, where mistakes are made, and it is necessary to correct patient demographics, or correct mistakes (wrong patient or request or side was selected during an exam and incorrect information present in the image headers). Standards exist that cover some use cases, such as IHE Patient Information Reconciliation (PIR) and Imaging Object Change Management (IOCM). Cross-domain identity and code resolution For an archive to span departments, institutions, regions or even national boundaries, the question of identification of entities and concepts must be addressed. In general, within a domain such as an individual institution, patient identifiers and identifiers of request, studies and reports (e.g., by accession numbers) are assigned uniquely within that domain, but not outside. Most internal systems (and most PACS) do not manage the existence of multiple identity domains, and if identifiers are used across domains then collisions and ambiguity occur. Thus each identifier needs to either be qualified by its \\"assigning authority\\" when used (the approach taken by the DICOM-based IHE Multiple Image Manager Archive (MIMA) profile) or coerced into a single \\"canonical\\" identifier that spans the scope of the larger domain that includes all integrated cross-enterprise systems (the approach taken by IHE Cross Enterprise Document Sharing. When importing outside images into the local archive, this matter also has to be addressed, usually by mapping the outside identifier into an internal identifier and re-encoding the information (coercion) in the DICOM \\"header\\" or other meta-data (such as by the manner specified in Import Reconciliation Workflow). Whether support for this is an essential feature for a VNA depends on what environment it is intended to be deployed in (within one enterprise or across enterprises), but robust support provides insurance against future deployment configuration changes (such as enterprise mergers). Likewise, local code sets used for such things as procedure codes (for \\"orderables\\", as opposed to billing codes), are not well standardized, and where these are useful in images to drive workflow and display (such as hanging protocols), an ability to map these too is a useful feature. Dynamic tag morphing One purpose of a VNA is to store information and serve it to multiple systems that may have different requirements for its use and expectations for very specific characteristics of the DICOM attributes and values stored in them, both standard and private. The concept of \\"dynamic tag morphing\\" is touted as a solution to the problem of two different systems expecting different values in the same attribute. \\"Tag morphing\\" refers to changing the values in one or more attributes (usually DICOM data elements in this context). This may be done \\"statically\\", in which case only one mapping is performed, or \\"dynamically\\", in which case multiple mappings, each specific to a particular recipient, is performed. In its degenerate form, the ability to map any tag and value to any other is inherently dangerous and undermines the value of attempting to standardize attributes in the first place, and the efforts by modality and PACS vendors to use them \\"properly\\". That said, there is variation in the installed base and even new products in how some fields are used, particularly for highly specific and advanced forms of imaging, and corresponding variation in what advanced display and analysis applications expect in their input. Accordingly this is a popular feature, despite its dangers. Some will argue strongly that it is an essential feature to be classed as a VNA. This feature is reminiscent of what is common in the HL7 version 2 world, a so-called Interface Engine, which is designed to map pretty much anything to anything else, depending on the source and target. A typical use case is to change the values in Series Description supplied by acquisition modalities, in order to allow two different PACS sharing the same data to use different hanging protocol rules based in Series Description. Arguably, this could be achieved in a more standard way if modalities populated other attributes in more detail, acquisition protocols and codes for them were better standardized and hanging protocol engines were more flexible, but given the limitations of the state of the art, this technique remains useful. Dynamic tag morphing is distinct from the specific attribute changes related to Cross-domain Identity and Code Resolution (what DICOM in PS 3.4 refers to as \\"coercion\\"), for which there are standards defined for what to change, when and how, and which often involve additional actors such as a Master Patient Index, though some proponents lump these together and some products implement them using the same mechanism. Michael Gray was an early proponent of tag morphing and regards it an essential VNA feature. A description of tag morphing use-cases can be found in Wayne Dejarnette's 2010 white paper. Information lifecycle management Disk is cheap, though power and air-conditioning are not, but regardless, storage has a finite cost, particularly when one is paying as one goes rather than using a locally hosted capitalized infra-structure. Accordingly, when medico-legal retention periods expire, or the clinical utility expires (such as on a patient's death), many users would like to be able to purge their storage. The rules for this are complex, and vary between jurisdictions as well as according to local policy. Given the conflicting demands of financiers, risk managers, litigators, researchers and educators, coming to agreement on such a policy may be difficult. Regardless, a potentially useful VNA feature is support for locally customizable rule-based purging (culling) criteria, whether it be by implementing the rules directly, or responding to IHE Imaging Object Change Management (IOCM) requests from a separate rules engine. Non-DICOM content VNAs should have no difficulty storing DICOM content such images and associated information such as presentation states and so-called \\"evidence documents\\", such as DICOM Structured Reports containing such things as measurements recorded by the modality, or post-processing results such as from CAD. In a clinical setting, however, other document and bulk object types may be available that it would be desirable to store. Most PACS take the approach of converting these to DICOM, in some cases using objects intended to \\"encapsulate\\" another type of object. The classic example is a scanned document stored as a PDF file and encapsulated in a DICOM PDF object along with sufficient metadata to identify it and manage it, as if it were an image. VNAs should support these type of encapsulated DICOM objects and the DICOM \\"header\\" provides a means to obtain the metadata for indexing to support query and retrieval. Michael Gray elaborates in detail on this topic in his white paper on the subject. For other object types, or when there is no DICOM encapsulation object available, or when there is no need to interface with DICOM systems, as long as there is a standard means of providing the necessary metadata for indexing, such as by using HL7 version 2 messages or XDS registry services, then in theory a VNA could store anything. Specific types of non-DICOM content, such as an HL7 CDA document instance containing, for example, a radiology report, could be stored either as a XDS, or first encapsulated in a DICOM Encapsulated CDA object and stored using DICOM services, or its content and header could be transcoded into a DICOM Structured Report instance. A fully featured VNA might have the ability to transcode any single instance into another form depending on what the requesting system needed (\\"object morphing\\", if you will). A description of Wayne Dejarnette's approach to non-DICOM object storage in his product is described in his 2009 white paper. Interface standardization Image file format on long term storage media There is general agreement that the use of the DICOM file format is required for images, and that where images are compressed for archival or transport, standard, not proprietary, compression schemes (transfer syntaxes) need to be used. Indeed, a distinguishing feature of most VNAs as opposed to many traditional PACS is the avoidance of proprietary internal formats ostensibly used in the past for \\"performance\\" reasons, whilst still obtaining good performance across the interfaces. Implementations may vary in the range of supported compression schemes, whether or not reversible (lossless) compression is mandatory for medico-legal archival purposes. Implementations also vary in the range of modality-specific image types that they support; though many archives will support all DICOM image information objects in principle, some extreme cases, like whole slide pathology images and long videos may not be supported. A general feature of VNAs is to attempt to preserve all attributes as originally supplied, including private (proprietary) attributes whether from the acquisition modality or added by other intervening applications (such as QC workstations or PACS). DICOM describes many different \\"Information Object Definitions\\" and \\"SOP Classes\\" for storage of images with specific metadata related to particular modalities and applications, and the list of these grows as technology evolves. Since the DICOM format is inherently extensible, and all new objects build upon a common encoding and pattern, a VNAs should be able to store any DICOM image object, regardless of whether the SOP Class is recognized or new. This may be achieved through the use of field-modifiable configuration to add new SOP Classes, or by analysis of the contents of the objects \\"header\\", or by the simple of approach of accepting, storing and regurgitating anything transferred via a DICOM C-STORE operation. Image transfer protocols =Conventional DICOM= Support of the basic DICOM C-STORE, C-FIND, C-MOVE and preferably C-GET are fundamental and not debated. The basic uncompressed transfer syntaxes including implicit and explicit VR little-endian, and the less common big-endian transfer syntax are typically supported. The range of compressed transfer syntaxes usually includes lossless JPEG and reversible and irreversible JPEG 2000, occasionally JPEG-LS, and usually lossy JPEG for images that were supplied that way (especially true color photographs. Support for motion compression (other than multi-frame JPEG) is less common, but perhaps more common in VNAs than in PACSs, especially for storage and regurgitation without viewing. =WADO= Most would agree that an important VNA interface is the original version of Web Access to DICOM Persistent Objects (WADO), which allows single images to be retrieved with an HTTP URL in either DICOM file format or pre-rendered into a consumer format like JPEG. =XDS-I.b= The SOAP Web Service based transactions of the IHE Cross Enterprise Document Sharing for Imaging are also generally considered a prerequisite for a claim to be a VNA. Image-related objects =Presentation states= The grayscale or color rendering transformation applied to images for display should be stored as a DICOM Presentation State object. These objects support grayscale and true color images, as well as the application of a pseudo-color lookup table to grayscale images. Presentation states can also record any zooming and panning (displayed area selection) applied. IHE uses these in the Consistent Presentation of Images (CPI) profile Since many modern PACS can also store image annotations using DICOM Presentation State objects, a VNA needs to support these, including not just storage and regurgitation, but also selection and display in any viewer supplied as a VNA component. =Annotations, regions of interest and measurements= The preferred format for storage of annotations, regions of interest, and measurements is the DICOM Structured Report (SR) object, which allows structure, coded and semantic information to be persisted, rather than just presentation. IHE refers to these as Evidence Documents (ED). DICOM SR objects may also be produced in the context of the IHE specifies these in the Simple Image and Numeric Report (SINR) profile. Since many Acquisition Modalities, mammography CAD systems and quantitative image analysis workstations produce SR objects, a VNA should be capable of storing and regurgitating these. Ideally, any viewer component should be capable of a generic (if not ideal) rendering of the content of any SR, including display of coordinates on referenced images. For specific domains, such as Radiotherapy, an older format, the DICOM RT Structure Set, which can encode 3D patient relative coordinate isocontours (only) is used, and some non-RT workstations produce these as well instead of SRs. A VNA needs to support these too. =Key images and object selection= A common concept in a PACS is for the user (such as a modality operator or interpreting radiologist) to flag some images (or other objects) as being \\"key\\", i.e., of particular interest for some reason. Though obsolete PACS may only record this as a flag in an internal database, modern PACS use the DICOM Key Object Selection object (a specialized form of SR) to export this information. This usage is described in the IHE Key Image Note (KIN) profile. A VNA needs to support storage and regurgitation of KOS objects, as well as selection and display of these in any viewer. =Radiation dose reports= Since many medical imaging techniques deliver non-trivial amounts of ionizing radiation to the patient, the dose exposure needs to be tracked, and in some jurisdictions this must be recorded by law. DICOM defines a specialized form of Structured Report, the Radiation Dose Structured Report (RDSR) to encode this. IHE uses these in the Radiation Exposure Management (REM) profile. A VNA must support storage and regurgitation these, and ideally, would be able to extract critical information for display in any viewer. =Procedure reports= In radiology and nuclear medicine applications, the practice of dictating and transcribing (or using speech recognition) is well entrenched and the output of these is typically unstructured or minimally structured prose, encoded as plain text and distributed by fax or HL7 version 2 messages or some equally primitive mechanism. The persistent form of these \\"documents\\" is not well-standardized, but many customers expect a VNA to be able to accept them in whatever local format is preferred. The same principles apply as for the storage of any non-DICOM content, including the use of HL7 version 2 messages or XDS to provide metadata in lieu of a structured \\"header\\", such as in the case of reports rendered as PDF, when they have not been encapsulated in DICOM or CDA objects. Now that HL7 has promised to relax its previously closed IP policy, including offering CDA free for use, it is possible that CDA will become the preferred form of encoding, but VNAs will still need to accept (and possibly transcode) reports in a plethora of form from the installed base. DICOM defines templates for the encoding of human-generated reports as DICOM Structured Report (SR) objects, and IHE specifies these in the Simple Image and Numeric Report (SINR) profile. =Radiotherapy objects= In addition to DICOM RT Structure Sets, for a VNA to be usable in an enterprise that performs Radiotherapy, the entire family of DICOM RT objects for beam, ion and brachytherapy need to be stored and regurgitated. =Raw data objects= DICOM defines a Raw Data object that is essentially a conventional DICOM composite instance header with patient, study, series and instance information, but no payload. It was intended for the storage of the raw data that is not easily represented as an image or image-like object, such as the raw views obtained from the detectors of a CT scanner, or the k-space data from an MRI scanner, but can be used to encode anything. A VNA should be able to store and regurgitate these, even though it may be unaware of their contents and only the originating device may be able to interpret them. =Audio, waveform and spectroscopy objects= Though there are many consumer formats for encoding audio in widespread use, these lack the header or metadata necessary to identify the patient and encounter. A VNA that wants to support these needs to have a means of providing such information, such as submission using XDS. DICOM does define a Basic Audio object, and though it does not support the plethora of audio codecs available in the consumer world, some PACS do produce them, so a VNA should support these. Time-based waveforms (such as ECGs) may be stored as DICOM or in a multitude of other formats, and the same principles apply as for audio; i.e., if the format is a medically oriented one, use the header meta-data for indexing during ingestion, if not, use XDS to register it. A DICOM MR Spectroscopy object is defined, and since some modalities produce it, a VNA should be able to store and regurgitate instances of it. =Private objects= DICOM allows for the concept of Private SOP Classes, which use the DICOM encoding and transfer mechanisms but whose content is opaque. Vendors use these to good effect when necessary to encode information that has not been standardized, and also abuse them for convenience in lieu of using a standard encoding. Regardless, since their content may be important to the clinical workflow, a VNA should be configurable to accept, store and regurgitate these.

The station's transmitter was located on 70th Street, next to Black Hawk College, near the Poplar Grove section of Moline, Illinois. WBQD was owned by Four Seasons Broadcasting (a partnership between Malibu Broadcasting in Cleveland, Ohio and Venture Technologies Group, LLC in Los Angeles, California) but operated through a local marketing agreement and a Technical Services Agreement by The New York Times Company, and later by Local TV LLC, both previous owners of ABC affiliate WQAD-TV, with studios for WBQD being co-located with WQAD-TV on Park 16th Street in the Prospect Park section of Moline. Upon going silent in December 2011, WBQD-LP was the second-to-last television station in the Quad Cities market to broadcast an analog signal, having been surpassed only by 3ABN translator station K16EL (now K20KF-D) which flash cut to digital operations in September 2012. History Northwest Television, the original owner of Galesburg licensed WMWC-TV, had applied for a license to broadcast on channel 53 and had planned to sign on September 1, 2001 as the UPN affiliate for the Quad Cities television market, with operations for the proposed station to be handled by Second Generation of Iowa, owner of KFXA in Cedar Rapids. However, the application for the new station was challenged by Grant Broadcasting System II, then-owner of KLJB-TV and KGWB-TV. In May 2002 after receiving permission to begin broadcasting on UHF channel 26, this station began transmitter tests and on June 1, signed on as WBQD-LP with the UPN network affiliation that was originally to have gone to WMWC. In November 2004, it was announced that WBQD would enter into a joint sales agreement with WQAD. On September 5, 2006, WBQD became a MyNetworkTV affiliate. It adopted the nickname \\"My TV 16\\" in reference to its channel number on Mediacom. WBQD's over-the-air signal did not reach the entire market due to its low-power status, but most viewers watched the station via its simulcast on WQAD's third digital subchannel, which covers the entire market. The station had a construction permit for a low-power digital transmitter on VHF channel 7 with the calls WBQD-LD. However on June 30, 2009, Four Seasons Broadcasting filed for digital displacement relief and requested to move its digital channel assignment to UHF channel 14 instead.http://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/cgi- bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/cdbsmenu.hts?context=25&appn;=101319809&formid;=346&fac;_num=167296 After an engineering study, it was determined that even as a low-power digital station, WBQD would cause and/or receive more than acceptable interference to and from KWWL in Waterloo, Iowa and KHQA-TV in Hannibal, Missouri, both of which are full power digital television stations that broadcast on channel 7 and had \\"flash-cut\\" to their former analog channels after the digital transition.http://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/getattachment_exh.cgi?exhibit_id=767551&formid;=346&q;_num=5100 While transmitting an analog signal, Four Seasons Broadcasting initially operated WBQD outright from 2002 to 2004. However, they had WBQD operated through a local marketing agreement (LMA) by The New York Times Company from 2004 to 2007 and by Local TV LLC from 2007 to 2011. This made it a sister outlet to WQAD and the two outlets shared studios. However, some internal operations of WBQD (such as the maintenance of program logs) were actually based at the shared facilities of co-owned MyNetworkTV affiliate WAOE as well as ABC/CW affiliate WHOI and NBC affiliate WEEK-TV in East Peoria, Illinois. During the overnight hours, WBQD aired paid programming from Corner Store TV. On December 9, 2011, WBQD-LP notified the FCC that they went silent after losing their tower lease on the Black Hawk College campus in Moline. This occurred more than a year after Black Hawk College sold public broadcasting station WQPT-TV to Western Illinois University-Quad Cities though there is no indication of any connection to this. However, on June 6, 2013, the FCC cancelled the license of WBQD-LP, after being off the air for over a year.FCC letter to Four Seasons Peoria, LLC, June 6, 2013. After WBQD went silent in December 2011, WQAD, which had for years been simulcasting WBQD's programming and MyNetworkTV affiliation in 480i 4:3 standard definition on digital subchannel 8.3 (WQAD-DT3), began operating the signal outright on channel 8.3,Broadcasting News-June 2013Iowa Media News 2013 rebranding it as \\"My TV 8.3\\" in reference to the station's virtual channel location. WQAD-DT3 later tweaked its branding to \\"My TV 8-3.\\" As WQAD is continuing to broadcast its programming on their own subchannel and cable providers used 8.3 as their signal source for the station for years, the low-powered license for WBQD-LP was practically all but redundant. On October 9, 2012, the cable channel assignment for WQAD-DT3 on Mediacom moved from channel 16 to channel 3. WMWC- TV was eventually granted its construction permit on July 20, 2007, and it finally signed on in August 2012 as a religious station affiliated with TBN. As of December 2012, WMWC is now owned and operated by the TBN network. On July 1, 2013, Local TV LLC announced that all of their stations, including WQAD, would be acquired by the Tribune Company. On April 22, 2014, WQAD-DT3 began broadcasting in high definition, utilizing MyNetworkTV's standard 720p format.

One of the earliest references in print to dastangoi is a 19th-century text containing 46 volumes of the adventures of Amir Hamza titled Dastan e Amir Hamza. The art form reached its zenith in the Indian sub-continent in the 19th century and is said to have died with the demise of Mir Baqar Ali in 1928. Dastangoi was revived by historian, author and director Mahmood Farooqui in 2005. At the centre of dastangoi is the dastango, or storyteller, whose voice is his main artistic tool in orally recreating the dastan or the story. Notable 19th-century dastangos included Amba Prasad Rasa, Mir Ahmad Ali Rampuri, Muhammad Amir Khan, Syed Husain Jah, and Ghulam Raza.

Dastan means a tale; the suffix -goi makes the word mean \\"to tell a tale\\". History Indian urban anthropologist Ghaus Ansari ascribed the origin of dastangoi to Pre- Islamic Arabia, and detailed how the eastward spread of Islam carried dastangoi to Iran and then to Delhi in India. From Delhi, dastangoi made its way to Lucknow in the 18th century, aided by the Indian Rebellion of 1857, during which several artists, writers and dastangos moved from Delhi to Lucknow. In Lucknow, dastangoi was popular across all classes, and was regularly performed at diverse locations including chowks (city squares), private households, and afeem khana (public opium houses). \\"It became so popular among opium addicts that they made listening to stories an important element of their gatherings,\\" wrote Ansari. \\"The prolonged intoxication and prolonged stories narrated by professional story-tellers was mostly combined. Each afeem khana had its own story-teller to entertain the clients; whereas, among the rich, every household used to appoint a dastango as a member of its staff.\\" According to Abdul Halim Sharar, the noted author and historian of nineteenth century Lucknow, the Art of dastangoi, was divided under the following headings:\\"War\\", \\"Pleasure, \\"Beauty\\", \\"Love\\" and \\"Deception\\". [6] by Mahmood Farooqui in 2005. Since then, he has performed thousands of shows across the world. The early dastango's told tales of magic, war and adventure, and borrowed freely from other stories such as the Arabian Nights, storytellers such as Rumi, and storytelling traditions such as the Panchatantra. From the 14th century, Persian dastangois started focusing on the life and adventures of Amir Hamza, the paternal uncle of the prophet Muhammad. The Indian stream of dastangoi added storytelling elements such as aiyyari (trickery) to these tales.

Ladies and Gentleman was released in India on 12 April 2013 as a festival release during the time of Vishu. Plot Chandrabose (Mohanlal) whose wife's (Meera Jasmine) death has led him to become an alcoholic. Chandrabose likes to keep a low profile and lives a rather carefree life. When he comes to Kochi, he saves a young IT professional (Krish. J. Sathaar) out of committing suicide and joins in the firm passing out positive philosophy which takes the firm from a struggling start-up to the top, and makes an impression on Anu (Mamta Mohandas), Jyothi (Padmapriya) and Chinnu (Mithra Kurian).

But he was busy with other films. Siddique was collaborating with Mohanlal after two decades since Vietnam Colony (1992), which he co-directed with Lal. Krish. J. Sathaar, son of actors Sathaar and Jayabharathi, makes his debut in films playing the role of Sarath. Siddique had seen Krish's photo a while ago and it was his face that came to his mind while he was searching for that character. About the film Siqqique says, \\"Ladies and Gentleman is essentially about the generation gap. Often, the older generation is set in their ways while the new generation is eager to believe that they are always right. Young achievers of today are mostly self-made and have a different attitude towards life\\". There were four heroines in the film‚ÄîMeera Jasmine, Mamta Mohandas, Mithra Kurian, and Padmapriya Janakiraman. While Meera plays the CEO of a company, Mamta and Mithra plays two software professionals, and Padmapriya is a flight attendant. \\"Lalettan's[Mohanlal] character Chandrabose is a workaholic who lives abroad, giving more preference to making money in life than anything else. Meera's character is the one who changes his life and makes him understand that it is not money but relationships, values and happiness in life that really matter. Then he tries to pass on that message to a group of youngsters from the IT field who are business-minded and chase happiness in a materialistic life\\", says the director. Filming Principal photography began with a pooja function held on 17 December 2012. While most of the portions were shot in Kerala, song, dance and few other sequences used in the flashback scenes was shot in Dubai. A bungalow at Kakkanad, Kochi was also a filming location. Ladies and Gentleman is the first film to capture the Dubai Miracle Garden, where the song and dance sequence of Mohanlal and Meera was shot. The film was also shot inside the IMAX theater Meydan. Filming in Dubai was done with support from the Dubai Film and TV Commission. Mini Sharma, the CEO of 7Media was the line producer in Dubai. The filming was wrapped on 19 March 2013 after a six days shoot there. With a crew of about 20 men, filming took place across several areas in Dubai, including the Dubai Miracle Garden, Dubai Media City, Marina Walk, Dubai Creek and Jumeirah Beach Residence. Some scenes were shot in a car showroom in Al Ain, Abu Dhabi. Release Ladies and Gentleman was awarded with the \\"U\\" (Universal) certificate by the Central Board of Film Certification in India. Distributed by Maxlab Cinemas and Entertainments, the film was released on 12 April 2013 in the country, during the festival of Vishu. It was released in 100 theatres across Kerala. PJ Entertainments distributed the film in Europe. The satellite rights were purchased by Asianet Communications Ltd. Pre-release revenue The film did a good pre-release business. Antony Perumbavoor and Roy C. J. invested close to 10 crores and received a profit of 1.5 crore before the theatrical release. The film brought in 11.5 crores in satellite, remake, and overseas rights due to the market value of Mohanlal and Siddique. It was the first time a Malayalam film was generating an amount over 11 crores before its release.  Home media  The home media rights of Ladies and Gentleman were purchased by Central Home Entertainment, and the DVDs were released on 9 October 2013. Reception Critical response Sify.com called it \\"average\\" and said, \\"Siddique, who has created some of the finest comedies in Malayalam history, seems to have lost his way with this one. Satheesh Kurup's visuals are fine, but Ratheesh Vegha's music doesn't impress much\\". Smitha of One India praised Mohanlal's acting but criticized the script saying \\"It is a light-hearted film with many comic situations. The script is half-baked. Moreover, the climax is a complete let down. Though the film starts off well, the second half falters and you are unable to make much sense of what director intended to do\\". Manu of NowRunning.com rated 2.1/5 and said that \\"The screenplay is half-baked in the first half. It gets a little bit interesting in the second part, though it goes on downhill very soon\\", and gave positive remarks to the cinematography, songs, and film score. The reviewer of Indiaglitz.com criticized the script, film score and songs but praised the cinematography, rating it 5/10. Rajeevan of MetroMatinee.com praised the lead performance, cinematography, film score and editing but criticized the songs and script saying \\"There is not much strength in the story but Mohanlal‚Äôs presence and the way the story is presented makes some difference. Mohanlal, in the lead role as a sluggish inebriated hero with a hidden intent, makes the movie watchable\\" Aswin J. Kumar of The Times of India rated the film 2.5/5 and stated \\"Ladies and Gentleman engage only in sparse moments; courtesy Shajon, who digs up some laughter from a parched narrative. It's not the celebration of virtues that mars the purpose, but a palpable lack of earnestness with which Siddique moulds his plot developed by ill-shaped characters.\\" Box office After a good opening, the film did not maintain the reception in the following weeks at the box office. Even then, Ladies and Gentleman completed 6,500 shows in Kerala theaters in five weeks. However, the film's theatrical run was affected when unlicensed copies of the film were illegally uploaded on the Internet in May 2013. Despite that, the film managed to ran for more than 50 days in theaters. Soundtrack The soundtrack was composed by Ratheesh Vegha, with lyrics penned by Rafeeq Ahmed and Salavoodheen Kecheri. The album consists of seven songs. The album was launched on 1 April 2013 at IMA Hall in Kochi. The event was attended by Mohanlal, Siddique, Ratheesh Vegha, Krish. J. Sathaar, Meera Jasmine, Mamta Mohandas, East Coast Vijayan and members of the technical crew and cast.

Its membership is mainly Latin and North American, European, and Pacific Rim-based. History In 1935 a group of practitioners in the new medical field of child psychiatry started work to establish and expand mutual contacts in spite of the social and political turmoil surrounding World War II. Two years later, they formed the \\"International Committee for Child Psychiatry\\". Georges Heuyer, the then head of the \\"Clinique annexe de neuropsychiatrie infantile\\" at the Salp√™tri√®re in Paris, organized and chaired the first congress there, calling it the \\"Premier Congr√®s international de psychiatrie infantile, Paris, 24 juillet au 1er ao√ªt 1937\\" [\\"First international conference on child psychiatry\\"]. The second international congress took place in London in 1948. During this meeting the international committee was renamed the \\"International Association for Child Psychiatry\\" (IACP) with about 30 national societies as members. All countries were to have access to IACP, however a credentials committee was set up to verify the qualifications of each applicant. The name was changed again during the Lisbon congress of 1958, this time to the \\"International Association for Child Psychiatry and Allied Professions\\" (IACP&AP;). At the 9th Congress (Melbourne, Australia, 1978) adolescents were incorporated in the official name: \\"The International Association for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Allied Professions\\" (IACAPAP). In 1954 they incorporated as a tax-exempt organization in Massachusetts. Today, the IACAPAP is registered in Geneva, Switzerland, as a non-government organization (NGO) structured as a corporation and empowered as a juridical entity according to the Swiss Civil Code and the Constitution.IACAPAP web site During the 1960s Acta Paedopsychiatrica served as the IACAPAP's official scientific journal. The on- line journal, Adolescent Psychiatry and Mental Health is the official scientific journal of IACAPAP. Donald J. Cohen became a vice-president of the IACAPAP in 1986, and was president from 1992‚Äì98. Its membership is global, but mainly North/Latin American, Asia-Pacific and Europe based, uniting many national organizations of child and adolescent psychiatry. Japan joined the organization in 1962. Until 1996, Tokyo hosted meetings of the regional Asian Society for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Allied Profession. A world congress convenes every four years. At the 13th such congress in Dublin, Ireland, in 1982, Sherman F. Feinstein was the Adolescent Psychiatry Program Chairman. The 16th World Congress was held in Berlin in August 1994. The Secretary General as of 2000 was Ian M.

The game revolves around a colour-matching concept, with a mechanic similar to that of Snake, taking place within a diffuse world of microorganisms. Developed by skip Ltd., the game is the fifth WiiWare installment in the Art Style series. It was initially released in Europe on May 28, 2010, under the alternative title Penta Tentacles, and followed in North America on June 21, 2010. It was eventually also released in Japan on October 18, 2011, preserving the launch title of the PAL release. Gameplay Set within a primordial ooze, the player controls a microscopic tentacled organism, known as a rotozoan. The objective of the game is to extend the rotozoan's tentacles by using them to absorb other organisms in the primordial ooze, known as goobugs. To absorb a goobug, the player has to move through the environment and rotate the rotozoan, in order to direct its tentacles to touch it. As goobugs are properly matched, the tentacles will extend by one segment for each bug absorbed. However, the tentacle must match the color of the goobug that it makes contact with. If the colours are a match, the tentacle will extend by one segment; but if the colours are a mismatch, the tentacle will break off at the point where the goobug touched it, also resulting in loss of a life. Some of the goobugs in the liquid are easy to absorb, as they simply float about aimlessly, while others may be combative and pursue the rotozoan. If the rotozoan makes too many mismatches with the goobugs it will run out of lives, and the game ends. To aid the rotozoan on its quest, the game spawns certain items during the progression of a stage. If the rotozoan has lost one or more lives, Heart items may occasionally float by. On every stage, there also spawns one Cyclone item, that can be activated at the player's discretion when absorbed. To activate the Cyclone, the player must press and hold either spin button, in order to build up Cyclone energy. If the rotozoan is damaged during the charging process, the Cyclone energy will discharge, and the player will have to repeat the process. Once the Cyclone energy is fully charged, the rotozoan can unleash the Cyclone. During a Cyclone, the rotozoan becomes invincible, while spinning automatically with all its tentacles spread out. It can then effortlessly absorb any goobug within the ooze for a limited time, allowing its tentacles to extend accordingly when the Cyclone has completed. In order to control the rotozoan and navigate within the ooze, the player is given a default option to use the Wii Remote controller, holding it in a horizontal position. The direction pad is used to move the rotozoan in any direction, while pressing the 1 and 2 buttons will respectively spin the rotozoan anticlockwise and clockwise. Alternatively, the Wii Classic Controller can be used instead of the Wii Remote. The Classic Controller offers the player greater precision, as the controller's left and right analogue sticks are supported for both movement and rotation. The player can, however, also use the Classic Controller's direction pad for movement, while the a and b buttons serve as alternative rotation buttons. The L and R shoulder buttons can also be used for rotation, ultimately allowing the player to choose any desired combination of buttons. Stages At the beginning of the game, Stages is the only game mode available for play. In this mode, the player is given a goal to extend each tentacle by a given length, in order to complete the stage and unlock the next. In the first level of stages, the rotozoan has only two tentacles. Once the player has completed the first three stages, a new level is unlocked. The next level then allows the player to proceed to a new set of stages, where the rotozoan has three tentacles. Eventually, as the third and fourth levels are subsequently unlocked, the player can proceed with new stages as a rotozoan with four and five tentacles, respectively. The rotozoan's initial pair of tentacles will always be red and yellow, while the third will be blue, the fourth white, and the fifth a green tentacle. As additional tentacles are introduced, bugs with matching colours also appear in each respective stage, thus increasing the difficulty of the colour-matching process, as the player advances to higher levels. While there is no concept of a scoring system in this mode, the game records the time spent completing a stage, allowing the player to compete against their previous best time records. Endless Once the player has completed the five initial stages of the first level, Endless Mode will be unlocked and appear on the title screen. Alternatively, Endless Mode can also be unlocked when the player completes any stage with the No Damage and No Cyclone achievements simultaneously, which rewards the All Completed achievement. In Endless Mode, there are no limits to how far the player can extend the rotozoan's tentacles, meaning the difficulty will increase as the tentacles become longer and more difficult to handle. However, Endless Mode also introduces the addition of Constriction items, as an aid to the player. When tentacles extend to certain lengths, Constriction items will spawn into the ooze, which can then be absorbed by the longer tentacles to contract them into clusters. Initially, Endless Mode only features the two- tentacled rotozoan. However, as new levels are unlocked in Stages Mode, rotozoans with additional tentacles also become available in Endless Mode. The gameplay in Endless Mode differs slightly from Stages Mode, as goobugs as introduced progressively in waves. While some waves may manifest as goobugs spawning at random positions within the ooze, other waves appear in a more structured manner, like chains of goobugs slowly approaching the rotozoan, or rows of goobugs aggressively running across the screen from both sides. The wave meter, indicated by a series of white dots in the upper right corner of the screen, indicates how many goobugs are needed to be absorbed, before the next wave emerges. The scoring system is another important aspect of Endless Mode, that allows the player to play for a high score. The points earned are determined by the length of each tentacle, so for every goobug that is matched, the player will earn a number of points reflecting the number of cells that the tentacle was extended to. For instance, if the yellow tentacle has four cells, the next yellow goobug absorbed will reward 5 points. If the player is also able to make matches rapidly, a multiplier bonus can be achieved for each match. This bonus will then increase for each successive match, until it peaks at √ó5. When the game is over, the highest score achieved is displayed on the title screen, when Endless Mode is selected. Snake Snake Mode plays out the same way as Endless Mode, with the exception that the rotozoan has only one tentacle, whereas the other half of the organism is translucent. The translucent side can then be used to destroy goobugs upon impact, giving the player an advantage. In Snake Mode, too, the player plays for points under the same directions as in Endless Mode, where the highest score achieved is recorded and displayed on the title screen. Uniquely to Snake Mode, however, the goobugs that are in contrast to the colour of the rotozoan's tentacle appear in various colours that are not present in any other mode, including deep blue, magenta and orange. Another unique feature about Snake Mode is the option to unlock and switch between themes. Once the player has managed to unlock the final stages for each level in Stages Mode, completing these with the All Completed achievement unlocks new themes in Snake Mode. The themes feature a background from Stages Mode, and also have a preset colour for the rotozoan's tentacle. This way, the player is rewarded for completing the most difficult sixth and seventh stages of each level in Stages Mode. Development Announced at a Nintendo press summit on February 24, 2010, Rotozoa was developed by skip Ltd, under the executive production of Satoru Iwata. The game sports a dark and fluid visual theme, with its graphic design credited to Yohei Kikuchi, while Kazuomi Suzuki's credit for sound design also spans an extensive soundtrack of ethnic beats and chants, fused with atmospheric electronic sounds. According to producer Kensuke Tanabe, the primary focus in the development of an Art Style game is the fusion between \\"visuals and sounds from an artistic viewpoint, using video games as a method\\". The soundtrack features a unique song for every stage and mode in the game, adding up to more than 35 tracks. As the player makes progress extending the rotozoan's tentacles, the music will begin to evolve, adding more elements to the sound. In an interview with Nintendo of Europe, Suzuki explained the concept as an idea of making \\"exclusive experiences that only can be made in video games\\", also noting that it has been an integral part of the Art Style project itself since its beginning. This feature can be noticed particularly when a significant amount of progress is lost by the breaching of a tentacle, as the additional elements in the music will simultaneously fade. Similarly, when the player rotates the rotozoan, an additional drum loop will layer with the music for as long as either spin button is held, sporting a unique drum pattern for every stage and mode. Reception Rotozoa received generally favorable reviews upon release, garnering a score of 68/100 on the review aggregation website Metacritic and 67.43% on GameRankings. Nintendo Life editor Sean Aaron stated that the game \\"is a real treat for the senses: it's visually beautiful and controls well with an outstanding soundtrack that engages and immerses the player into the simple, but compelling gameplay\\", giving the game a rating of 9/10. Craig Harris of IGN was also pleased with the game, noting \\"[it's] definitely one of the higher tier games in the Art Style series: easy to understand, with a fantastic art style [and] several unlockables that change up the gameplay\\".

Matti Vihakas, Petri T√§htinen, Vladimir Ossipov and Juha-Pekka Salminen, Journal of Chemical Ecology, May 2012, Volume 38, Issue 5, pages 538-546, Life cycle The European pine sawfly typically hatches from early April to late May. The larvae feed on existing pine needles. When they mature, they spin into cocoons. In the fall, they leave their cocoons as wasp-like creatures and mate. September and October are when the female lays eggs in pine trees for the next generation. Their favorite trees are Scots pine, red pine, Jack pine, and Japanese pines. Pest The European pine sawfly is considered a pest as it eats a lot of needles. While this can stunt the growth of the tree, it rarely is enough to kill the tree. For controlling it, one can use natural parasites, remove the eggs from the tree, or spray pesticides. Any standard pesticide sprayed on them during their larval stage will kill them. Spraying is usually done very early, often when they're first spotted.

Definition  The BM principle states that the optimum of a traffic network with N network bottlenecks is reached when dynamic traffic optimization and/or control are performed in the network in such a way that the probability for spontaneous occurrence of traffic breakdown in at least one of the network bottlenecks during a given observation time reaches the minimum possible value. The BM principle is equivalent to the maximization of the probability that traffic breakdown occurs at none of the network bottlenecks.  Empirical ground  The empirical ground for Kerner‚Äôs BM principle is the set of fundamental empirical features of traffic breakdown at a highway bottleneck found in measured traffic data: # Traffic breakdown at a highway bottleneck is a local phase transition from free flow (F) to congested traffic whose downstream front is usually fixed at the bottleneck location. Within this front, vehicles accelerate from congested traffic to free flow downstream of the bottleneck. # At the same bottleneck, traffic breakdown can be either spontaneous (Figure 1(a)) or induced (Figure 1 (b)). # The probability of traffic breakdown is an increasing flow rate function. # There is a well-known hysteresis phenomenon associated with traffic breakdown: When the breakdown has occurred at some flow rates with resulting congested pattern formation upstream of the bottleneck, then a return transition to free flow at the bottleneck is usually observed at considerably smaller flow rates (Figure 2). A spontaneous traffic breakdown occurs, where there are free flows both upstream and downstream of the bottleneck before the breakdown has occurred (Fig. 1(a)). In contrast, an induced traffic breakdown is caused by a propagation of a congested pattern that has earlier emerged for example at another downstream bottleneck (Figure 1 (b)). Figure 1: Fundamental empirical features of traffic breakdown (F ‚Üí S transition) at a highway bottleneck: (a, b) Averaged measured speed in space and time in the cases of spontaneous (a) and induced (b) traffic breakdowns. Figure 2: Fundamental empirical features of traffic breakdown at a highway bottleneck: Hysteresis phenomenon cause by traffic breakdown (F ‚Üí S transition) and return transition from congested to free flow (S ‚Üí F transition). The set 1‚Äì4 of the fundamental empirical features of traffic breakdown at a highway bottleneck has first been explained in Kerner‚Äôs three-phase theory (Figure 3). In Kerner‚Äôs theory there are three phases: Free flow (F), synchronized flow (S), wide moving jam (J). Synchronized flow and wide moving jam are associated with congested traffic. The synchronized flow phase is defined as congested traffic whose downstream front is fixed at the bottleneck. Therefore, in accordance with empirical feature 1 traffic breakdown is a phase transition from free flow to synchronized flow (called F ‚Üí S transition). The main feature of an F ‚Üí S transition is as follows (Figure 3 (c, d)): There is a broad range of flow rates on a link of the traffic network between the minimum and maximum capacities of free flow. Within this range of flow rates traffic breakdown occurs with some probability, which depends on the flow rate (Figure 3 (c)). Figure 3: Explanations of the fundamental empirical features of traffic breakdown at a highway bottleneck with Kerner‚Äôs three-phase theory: (a, b) Simulations of spontaneous (a) and induced (b) traffic breakdowns at a highway bottleneck. (c) Simulated flow-rate dependence of probability of traffic breakdown at a highway bottleneck. (d) Qualitative Z-characteristic for highway traffic in the speed‚Äîflow-rate plane (arrow is related to an F ‚Üí S transition); bottleneck states labeled by circles F and S are related to free flow and synchronized flow.  Mathematical formulation  Assuming that at different bottlenecks traffic breakdown occurs independently, the probability for spontaneous occurrence of traffic breakdown in at least one of the network bottlenecks during a given observation time can be written as: : P_\\\\mathrm{net}=1-\\\\prod^N_{k=1}(1-P^{(B,k)}) In accordance with the BM principle, the network optimum is reached at : \\\\min_{q_1,q_2,\\\\ldots,q_M}\\\\\\\\{P_\\\\mathrm{net}( q_1,q_2,\\\\ldots,q_M)\\\\\\\\} Here, M is the number of network links for which flow rates can be adjusted; q_{m} is the link inflow rate for a link with index m; m=1,2,\\\\ldots,M, where M>1; k is the bottleneck index, k=1,2,\\\\ldots,N, N>1; P^{(B,k)} is the probability that during the observation time interval traffic breakdown occurs at bottleneck with index k.  Simulations  Results of simulations of the BM principle for a simple network consisting of only two routes are shown in Figure 4(a). Although the probability of traffic breakdown is an increasing flow rate function for each of the bottlenecks (Figure 3(c)), the probability of traffic breakdown in the network P_\\\\mathrm{net} has a minimum as a function of the link inflow rates q_1 and q_2 (Figure 4(b, c)). Figure 4: Simulations of the BM principle for simple network model shown in (a). (b, c) probability of traffic breakdown in the network P_\\\\mathrm{net} found with the BM principle. In (a), alternative routes 1 and 2 have lengths L_1 and L_2, where L_2>L_1; routes 1 and 2 are roads with on-ramp bottlenecks whose on-ramp inflow rates q_{on1} and q_{on2} are given constants. Network optimization is performed through the assignment of a network inflow with the rate q_O between network links m=1 and m=2.  Alternative routes in a network  Before the BM principle is applied to a large traffic network, for each of the origin- destination (O‚ÄìD) pairs of the network a set of alternative routes (paths) should be found. The alternative routes can be calculated based on the following assumptions: (i) there is free flow in the whole network and (ii) the maximum difference between travel times for alternative routes does not exceed a given value that can be chosen differently for different O‚ÄìD pairs.  How to apply the BM principle if traffic breakdown has already occurred at a network bottleneck  Network optimization with measured features of traffic breakdown can consist of the stages: (i) A spatial limitation of congestion growth with the subsequent congestion dissolution at the bottleneck, if the dissolution of congestion due to traffic management in a neighborhood of the bottleneck is possible. (ii) The minimization of traffic breakdown probability with the BM principle in the remaining network, i.e., the network part that is not influenced by congestion.  The BM principle and classical Wardrop‚Äôs UE and SO principles  The BM principle is an alternative to well-known principles for vehicular network optimization and control based on the minimization of travel costs (travel time, fuel consumption, etc.) or the maximization of traffic throughput (like the maximization of band width of green wave in a city).Wardrop J.G.

Meyers. Springer, Berlin, pp. 9470‚Äî9500. In particular, the most prominent classical principles for the minimization of travel costs in a traffic network are Wardrop‚Äôs user equilibrium (UE) and system optimum (SO) principles that are widely used in a theory of dynamic traffic assignment in the network. Wardrop's SO and UE principles have been explained in Secs. 7.1 and 7.2 of wikipedia article traffic flow. However, when the flow rate on a link of a network is between the maximum and minimum capacities, there may be at least two different states of a bottleneck on the link denoted by circles F and S shown in Figure 3 (d). The state F is related to free flow and state S to synchronized flow. Therefore, hypothetically assuming that each of the link flow rates for each of the N network bottlenecks is between the associated minimum and maximum bottleneck capacities, we find that there may be 2^N different bottleneck states in the network at the same distribution of the flow rates in the network. If we apply an optimization algorithm associated with the minimization of travel cost in the network random transitions between these bottleneck states F and S may occur at different network bottlenecks during network optimization and/or control. Rather than some travel costs, in the BM principle the objective function that should be minimized is the probability of traffic breakdown in the network P_\\\\mathrm{net}. Thus the objective function in the BM principle that should be minimized depends neither on travel time nor other travel cost. The BM principle demands the minimization of the probability of traffic breakdown, i.e., the probability of the occurrence of congestion in the network. Under great traffic demand, the application of the BM principle should result in relatively small travel cost associated with free flow in a network.

(2001). Wechsler Test of Adult Reading: WTAR. San Antonio. The Psychological Corporation  Test Design  Developed for use with English-speaking patients aged 16 to 89 years, WTAR is a ‚Äúhold‚Äù test, a type of neuropsychological test that relies on abilities thought to be unaffected by cognitive decline associated with neurological damage. In the design of WTAR, the demographic prediction tables were co-normed with the widely used Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) and Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS). This gives it an advantage for comparative analyses on predicted and actual general intellectual and memory function over similar reading tests such as the National Adult Reading Test (NART), which do not share normative data sets with the other widely used Wechsler assessments.Spreen, O., & Strauss, E. (2006). A compendium of neuropsychological tests: Administration, norms, and commentary. Oxford University Press, USA. Using vocabulary level as a correlate to IQ, the test relies on reading recognition‚Äôs resistance to the cognitive impacts of brain damage to estimate premorbid function. The patient is presented with irregularly spelled words and prompted to pronounce each; the irregular grapheme-to-phoneme translations (such as the ‚Äúgh‚Äù in the word tough) in the prompts make it difficult pronounce without having previously learned the word. Since the patient cannot apply standard pronunciation rules to complete the task, the examiner can assess their vocabulary by their ability to pronounce the irregularly spelled words, and by extension, estimate their premorbid IQ. WTAR was published in 2001 by Pearson.  Instructions for administration and scoring  The WTAR is composed of 50 irregularly spelled words and takes approximately 10 minutes to complete. The examiner begins by presenting the first word card and prompting the patient for a single pronunciation of the word. This procedure continues through all 50 word cards and is discontinued if the patient provides 12 consecutive incorrect pronunciations. Lists of acceptable pronunciations and tape recordings are provided by the publisher to account for words with multiple pronunciation variants. Each correct pronunciation is given a score of 1, with 50 as the maximum raw score. The raw score is then standardized by age and compared to the scores predicted for the patient‚Äôs demographic classification.  Validity  In standardized samples, WTAR scores were shown to correlate highly with measures of verbal IQ (r = .75), verbal comprehension (r = .74), and full scale IQ (r = .73). Patients recovering from traumatic brain injury (on average measuring in severely impaired ranged on the Glasgow Coma Scale) showed high stability in WTAR scores during their recovery period while performing highly similar to demographic estimates, suggesting the test is a reliable estimate of premorbid intelligence in individuals with TBI.Green, R. E., Melo, B., Christensen, B., Ngo, L. A., Monette, G., & Bradbury, C. (2008). Measuring premorbid IQ in traumatic brain injury: An examination of the validity of the Wechsler Test of Adult Reading (WTAR). Journal of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology, 30(2), 163-172. Presented in an inpatient neuropsychologic battery for TBI, WTAR scores have been shown to be significant predictors of 1-year outcome, suggesting score stability over time and predictive validity.Hanks, R.A., Millis, S.R., Ricker, J.H., Giacino, J.T., Nakese-Richardson, R., Frol, A.B., Novack, T.A., Kalmar, K., Sherer, M., Gordon, W. (2008). The predictive validity of a brief inpatient neuropsychologic battery for person with traumatic brain injury. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, 89, 950-957. WTAR performance also appears to remain stable in patients exerting suboptimal effort.Whitney, K. A., Shepart, P.H., Mariner, J., Mossbarger, B., Herman, S. (2010). Validity of the Wechsler Test of Adult Reading (WTAR): Effort Considered in a Clinical Sample of U.S. Military Veterans. Applied Neuropsychology: Adult, 17(3), 196-204. Evaluation of WTAR scores across the degree of sustained TBI (mild, moderate, severe) suggests that the assessment may underestimate premorbid IQ in patients with more severe damage.Mathias, J.L., Bowden, S.C., Bigler, E.D., Rosenfeld, J.V. (2007). Is performance on the Wechsler test of adult reading affected by traumatic brain injury? British Journal of Clinical Psychology, 46(4), 457-466. In patients with Alzheimer's disease, WTAR scores declined as the degree of cognitive impairment increased in more affected individuals.McFarlane, J, Welch, J, Rodgers, J. (2006). Severity of Alzheimer's disease and effect on premorbid measures of intelligence. British Journal of Clinical Psychology, 45(4) 453-63. Individuals with preexisting learning disorders were found to perform poorly relative to those without learning disorders. Reading-disabled individuals scored lower on WTAR than on WAIS test measures; WTAR is not recommended for use with such individuals.

With an apparent magnitude of around +6.8 cannot be seen with the naked eye except under very favourable conditions, but it's easy to see with binoculars or amateur telescopes.  Physical characteristics  V905 Sco in comparison to other LBVs and cool hypergiants V905 Sco has a peculiar variable spectral type with emission lines and P Cygni profiles. At visual maximum it is similar to an A9 star and at minimum close to B8. The distance has been estimated at 2.5 kiloparsecs (8,200 light years) based on the assumption of an absolute magnitude of -8.9.

It is a bowed string instrument with either five or six strings and a fretted neck. The pardessus first appeared in the early 18th century, and was commonly played by women, particularly in French- speaking countries. Description The pardessus de viole is the smallest of the viol family. Its size is similar to the violin's, and its range is correspondingly similar. The strings are made of gut (like on any bowed string instrument until the 1970s) and the top string was tuned to g, a fourth higher than the top string of the treble viol. Like the treble viol, the pardessus de viole was almost never used to play accompaniment chords, but was always a melody instrument. When played, it is played upright on the lap with a bow. Unlike the treble viol and other viol instruments, the pardessus usually has only five strings. The five string pardessus is tuned in fifths and fourths (g, d', a', d, g), while six stringed pardessus are tuned like other viols in fourths with a third (g, c', e', a', d, g or g, c', f', a', d, g). Like on the treble viol, players disagreed on whether the pardessus should be fingered with diatonic fingering (like on a violin) or chromatic fingering (like other viols, violoncelli and bass violins). History The pardessus de viole was invented around the year 1700. Violins had begun emerging in Italy, and the pardessus was developed to allow people accustomed to viols to play violin music. With a sound more reminiscent of the viol to audiences unaccustomed to the sound of the violin, musicologist Annette Otterstedt has characterized the pardessus as a hybrid between viols and violins. The pardessus was often played by women, as the method of holding the pardessus in one's lap was considered more lady-like than holding a violin on the shoulder. The pardessus was most popular in French-speaking countries, but by 1770 it was starting to disappear from the landscape as viols generally were being eclipsed by the louder stringed instruments of the violin family.

He was particularly known for the discovery of the fossil deposit in the Olduvai Gorge, which in the following years delivered many findings of hominins.  Life  The son of the merchant William Kattwinkel (died 1877) and Henriette Kattwinkel, born Bancklotz (1833‚Äì1898) studied science in Bonn and Strasbourg, from 1894, medicine in Bonn, K√∂nigsberg and Erlangen.Glowatzki G: Kattwinkel. In: New German Biography Oxford University Press, Berlin 1977. Seiten 331‚Äì332. He received his Ph.D. in 1892 and obtained an MD in 1894 in Munich. In 1895 he married in Schwelm Martha (born 1872), daughter of the factory owner Julius Schmidt. After his military service Kattwinkel was a volunteer assistant to Hugo von Ziemssen and a guest student from 1900 to 1905 at H√¥pital Salp√™tri√®re and the Bic√™tre in Paris. In 1902 he qualified as a professor in Munich, and in 1909 was appointed Associate Professor of Neurology and gained a passing knowledge of paleontology, especially in the German Society for Anthropology, Ethnology and Prehistory from Karl Alfred von Zittel and Johannes Ranke. From 1910-1911 Kattwinkel, with his wife, undertook a privately funded research trip to German East Africa to investigate sleeping sicknessMaier G: African Dinosaurs Unearthed: The Tendaguru Expeditions'. 'Indiana University Press 2003 In 1911 he discovered on the southeastern edge of today's Serengeti National Park a rich fossil-finding site that he named Olduvai Gorge after the Maasai word Oldupai for the sisal Sansevieria ehrenbergii and Sansevieria suffruticosa of the area. His research was subsequently supported by a further expedition of the Geological Institute of Munich and Berlin led by Ernst Freiherr Stromer von Reichenbach (Munich), August Rothpletz (1853-1918, Munich) and Wilhelm von Branca (Berlin). In 1913, under the direction of geologist Hans Reck, the expedition found the first fossils of hominins. This was followed by a further expedition in 1914 funded by Kattwinkel himself. By the outbreak of World War I, the previously described expedition of WB Sattler and G. Schulze were interned. Kattwinkel withdrew his funding and never visited the Olduvai Gorge again. Kattwinkel launched and ran a military hospital until 1918. In the 1920s, he took up work as a doctor at \\"Wiggers Sanatorium\\" in Partenkirchen.

Stable value funds are often made available in these plans under a name that intends to describe the nature of the fund (such as capital preservation fund, fixed-interest fund, capital accumulation fund, principal protection fund, guaranteed fund, preservation fund, or income fund among others). They offer principal preservation, predictable returns, and a rate higher than similar options without proportionately increasing risk. The funds are structured in various ways, but in general they are composed of high quality, diversified fixed income portfolios that are protected against interest rate volatility by contracts from banks and insurance companies. For example, a stable value fund may hold highly rated government or corporate debt, asset- backed securities, residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities, and cash equivalents.Lemke and Lins, ERISA for Money Managers, ¬ß2:135 (Thomson West, 2013 ed.). Stable value funds are designed to preserve principal while providing steady, positive returns, and are considered one of the lowest risk investment options offered in 401(k) plans. Stable value funds have recently been returning an annualized average of 2.72% as of October 2014, higher than the 0.08% offered by money-market funds, and are offered in 165,000 retirement plans.  Explanation  The investment objective of stable value funds is to provide capital preservation and predictable, steady returns. During the 2008 financial crisis, stable value funds were one of the few 401(k) investments that produced a positive return; stable value fund returns generally ranged between 3 and 5 percent for 2008. Stable value funds generally invest in high credit rating bonds, typically AAA and AA, and then ‚Äúwrap‚Äù them with contracts issued by banks and insurance companies that help smooth out the returns of the underlying portfolio of bonds. The wrap protects the fund in times of market volatility by smoothing out the losses and gains of the underlying investments over the duration of the fund. Another popular stable value structure is the general account product which provides a fixed rate of return for a stated period backed by the full faith and credit of the insurance company and transfers investment risks to the insurer as well. Stable value funds have a level of risk and stability similar to that of money market funds but generate higher returns. Stable value funds are offered in approximately half of all 401(k) plans and some 529 tuition savings plans. Individuals have invested $770 billion in stable value funds through 165,000 defined contribution plans, which include 457, 403(b) and 401(k) plans as of June 2015.  History  Stable value funds have been around since the inception of US defined contribution plans in the 1970s. Initially they consisted of guaranteed investment contracts, or GICs, which were backed solely by the issuer‚Äôs claims-paying ability. GICs are issued by insurance companies and guarantee principal invested plus a periodically-reset interest rate for a specific duration. The primary concern plan sponsors had in regards to GICs was the lack of flexibility and ownership of assets, which was partly remedied with the creation of separate account GICs. Separate account GICs hold the assets of the plan in a separate account that cannot be used to settle claims against the insurer‚Äôs general account. Then in mid-1988 a broader array of stable value funds began to be offered, including the now common synthetic GIC. A synthetic GIC is a contract for a separately managed portfolio of fixed securities that is owned by the plan, often referred to as a wrap because it wraps the portfolio and protects it against rate fluctuations. In 2007, the Department of Labor excluded stable-value funds from their list of qualified default investment alternatives (QDIAs), but allowed retirement plans using stable-value funds a \\"grandfather\\" their choice. Today, the most commonly used type of contract in stable value funds is the synthetic GIC and from 1999 through 2014 stable value funds averaged a total return of 4.35% with a standard deviation of 1.23%. For money-market funds, the average total return was 1.93% with a standard deviation of 2.08%; and for intermediate-term bonds, 4.82% and 3.15%.  Types of stable value funds  Stable value funds are structured in one of three ways: as a separately managed account, which is a stable value fund managed for one specific 401(k) plan; as a commingled fund, which pools together assets from many 401(k) plans and offers the benefits of diversification and economies of scale for smaller plans; or as a guaranteed insurance company account, which issues a group annuity contract directly to the plan. Regardless of how stable value funds are structured, they are a diversified portfolio of fixed income securities that are insulated from interest rate movements by contracts from banks and insurance companies. How this contract protection is delivered depends on the type of stable value fund investment purchased and is provided through one or more of the following investment instruments:  Guaranteed Investment Contract (GIC)/General Account Contract  A group annuity contract with an insurance company that provides principal preservation and a specified rate of return over a set period of time, regardless of the performance of the underlying invested assets. The invested assets are owned by the insurance company and held within the insurer‚Äôs general account.  Separate Account Contract  A contract with an insurance company that provides principal preservation and a specified rate of return over a set period of time on an account that holds a combination of fixed income securities. Separate accounts may provide either a fixed, indexed, or periodic rate of return based on the performance of the underlying assets. The assets are owned by the insurance company and are set aside in a separate account solely for the benefit of the specific contract holder or retirement plan.  Synthetic GIC  A contract with a bank or insurance company (commonly referred to as a wrap) that guarantees a rate of return for a portfolio of assets held in an external trust. The rate of return is reset periodically and is based on the actual performance of the underlying assets. The assets are owned by the participating plan or plans. The typical stable value fund will diversify contract protection by investing in more than one instrument type and/or with more than one insurance company or bank. Stable value portfolio managers also limit risk by holding a mix of maturities, such as intermediate-term bonds and short-term bonds generally with credit ratings of AAA or AA.  Risks  Stable value funds are considered one of the lowest risk investments offered in 401(k) plans; however, like any investment, they do have some risks, which include:  Interest Rate Lag  In rapidly changing rate environments the returns on stable value funds may change more slowly than those of the marketplace, including similar investments such as money market funds. However, stable value funds still tend to outperform investments such as money market funds over time.  Liquidity Risk  To prevent yield chasing, stable value funds generally contain ‚Äúequity wash rules‚Äù limiting transfers to competing investments such as a money market fund or short-term bond fund. Generally a participant must first place money in a stock or equity fund for at least 90 days, but cash withdrawals have no waiting periods.  Contract Issuer/Guarantor Risk  Contract issuers can become less financially stable. This risk is most pronounced in funds with non-synthetic GICs because a single guarantor is backing the fund with the full faith and credit of the company. Most stable value funds mitigate this risk by purchasing contracts from multiple issuers, and stable value contract providers are generally strong financial institutions.  Investor Cash Flows Affect Returns  An influx of money to a stable value fund during a period of low interest rates can result in more investments at the current rate, which may dilute returns for investors. However, the alternative is also true. Large outflows of money into a stable value fund when interest rates are high can alternatively increase returns. Most stable value funds include a cash buffer to pay out withdrawals and minimize cash flow effects so the stable value fund crediting rates remain stable and consistently positive.  Employer Initiated Events  Certain employer initiated events can limit the liability of contract issuers, potentially leaving investors with losses. Events such as major layoffs, mergers, and bankruptcy will typically invalidate the portfolio‚Äôs contracts since they increase the possibility that an issuer would have to pay out on contracts for these management initiated events. Losses in such cases are rare, since most companies generally have enough time to negotiate continued coverage for the stable value fund. Many stable value funds have survived bankruptcies without any losses, for example in the case of Enron in 2001.  Regulations  Stable value funds have multiple layers of government oversight. The vast majority of funds are regulated by the Department of Labor's Employee Benefits Security Administration and must comply with the federal pension law, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). Stable value funds in defined contribution plans for state and local governments (457 plans) are regulated by the states, which have adopted requirements similar to ERISA. In addition to the Department of Labor, stable value investment structures provided and/or managed by banks are regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of Currency and/or the Federal Reserve. Stable value funds offered by insurance companies are regulated by the various state insurance departments, and commingled investment funds are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Investment Company Act. All stable value funds must comply with accounting regulations by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) (for corporate defined contribution plans) or the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) (for state and local defined contribution plans) to qualify for contract value accounting and reporting. Generally, FASB and GASB require that a stable value fund must meet all of the following criteria: *The contract is effected directly between the fund and issuer and prohibits the sale or assignment of the contract or its proceeds to another party without the consent of the issuer; *The repayment of principal and interest credited to participants in the fund is a financial obligation of the issuer of the contract. Prospective interest-crediting rate adjustments are permitted as long as they are not less than zero, and the contract issuer must be a financially sound institution; *The terms of the contract require all permitted participant-initiated transactions with the fund to occur at contract value; *An event that limits the ability of the fund to transact at contract value with the issuer and limits the ability of the fund to transact at contract value with participants in the fund must not be probable of occurring; *The fund itself must allow participants reasonable access to their funds.  Role in a Portfolio  Stable value funds are a low risk option for retirement plans and provide stability for investors seeking to minimize volatility, which is important for an investor nearing retirement or in retirement who would want to preserve principal and minimize risk. Because of their low risk and stable, consistent returns they also can help diversify 401(k) asset allocation for all investors.  Comparable Investments   Money Market Funds A money market fund (also known as money market mutual fund) is an open-ended mutual fund that invests in short-term debt securities such as US Treasury bills and commercial paper. Money market funds are widely (though not necessarily accurately) regarded as being as safe as bank deposits yet providing a higher yield. Regulated in the US under the Investment Company Act of 1940, money market funds are important providers of liquidity to financial intermediaries. Stable value funds have outperformed money market funds in every 12-month period since 1985 with similar volatility and risk and slightly less liquidity.  Bond Funds A bond fund is a fund that invests in bonds or other debt securities. Bond funds can be contrasted with stock funds and money funds. Bond funds typically pay periodic dividends that include interest payments on the fund's underlying securities plus periodically realized capital appreciation. Bond funds typically pay higher dividends than CDs and money market accounts. Most bond funds pay out dividends more frequently than individual bonds. Stable value funds offer returns similar to those of intermediate bond funds but with less volatility and risk, and are often recommended as a replacement for bonds in diversified portfolios.

First flown on 20 June 1908, it made a series of successful flights including a 12-hour flight over Switzerland. It was destroyed when it caught fire after landing to carry out engine repairs during a projected 24-hour endurance trial.Robinson 1973 p.34 This disaster proved fortunate for Zeppelin: donations by the German public raised 6.5 million marks, so guaranteeing the future of his development of airships. Background The successful flights of LZ 3 in 1906 had produced a change in the official attitude to Count Zeppelin's work, and a grant of 500,000 marks had been voted by the Reichstag. However, a condition of purchase by the government was the completion of a 24-hour trial flight. This was beyond the capabilities of LZ 3, so work was started on a larger airship with greater fuel capacity.Robinson 1973, p. 33. Design and development Zeppelin airship, model 4 Construction of LZ 4 was started in November 1907. The design closely followed that of LZ 3, but with increased diameter and length and having 17 gasbags. A central crew cabin was added in the middle of the keel, from which a ladder ran up through the envelope to an observation platform on top of the hull, intended for making star-sightings for navigational purposes. Initially, small rectangular rudders were fitted at either end of the hull: these proved inadequate to control the airship and were removed and replaced by single rudders mounted between the tips of the biplane horizontal stabilisers at the stern. Later each of these was replaced by a pair of rudders, and large fixed fins bearing a large oval rudder fitted at the stern.Robinson 1973, p. 35. Operational history LZ 4 was first flown on 20 June 1908, when a flight lasting 18 minutes revealed the inadequacy of its steering arrangements. After modifications further trials were made on 23 and 29 June, and on 1 July a spectacular 12 hour cross-country flight was made during which it was flown over Switzerland to Z√ºrich and then back to Lake Constance, covering 386 km (240 mi) and reaching an altitude of 795 m (2,600 ft).Robinson 1973 p. 36. On 13 July 1908, the airship was reinflated with fresh hydrogen to ensure maximum lift for the planned 24-hour endurance trial, which was to be a return flight to Mainz. Shortly after setting off the next morning a fan broke on the forward engine and it had to turn back. The following day it was damaged while being manoeuvered out of its hangar: repairs were not completed until the end of the month. The trial flight finally started on 4 August, when LZ 4 lifted off at 06:22 in the morning, carrying 12 people and sufficient fuel for 31 hours of flight. The flight to Z√ºrich had excited considerable public interest, and large crowds gathered along the route to witness the flight, which took it over Konstanz, Schaffhausen, Basel and Strasbourg. Shortly after passing Strasbourg the forward engine had to be stopped since the fuel tank in the engine gondola had been exhausted, and needed to be refilled. At this point the airship was flying light due to the heat of the sun having caused the hydrogen to expand, and was being held at a low altitude by dynamic downforce generated by flying in a nose-down attitude: with the loss of the power of one engine, it rose to an altitude of , venting gas from the relief valves as it did so. At 1:58 p.m the aft engine had to be stopped for refuelling: this time the airship rose to , with a further loss of hydrogen. Two further engine stoppages caused further loss of gas: by now LZ 4 was only being kept in the air by dynamic lift generated by flying with a nose-up attitude, the resultant drag reducing its speed to , and at 5:24 pm a landing was made on the Rhine near Oppenheim, short of Mainz. All superfluous items and five crew members were unloaded, and the flight was resumed at 10:20. Mainz was reached half an hour later, and the ship turned to begin its return journey. Further engine problems followed: a crank bearing in the forward engine melted at 1:27 am, reducing airspeed to about and it was decided to land to have the engine repaired by engineers from the Daimler works at Untert√ºrkheim. Accordingly, LZ 4 was set down at 7:51 am at EchterdingenFritzsche pp 9-58Zeising, J.

The airship was tethered and engineers removed the forward engine to make repairs, but during the afternoon LZ 4 was torn from its moorings by a gust of wind. The soldiers present as a ground handling party could not hold it down, but it was brought to earth by a crew member who had remained on board. Unfortunately, the ship came into contact with some trees while landing, which presumably damaged some of the gasbags, since it immediately caught fire.Robinson 1973 p. 39 The cause of ignition was later ascribed to a static charge being produced when the rubberised cotton of the gasbags was torn.Robinson 1973 p. 66. The disaster took place in front of an estimated 40 to 50 thousand spectators and produced an extraordinary wave of nationalistic support for Zeppelin's work. Unsolicited donations from the public poured in: enough had been received within 24 hours to rebuild the airship, and the eventual total was over 6 million marks were donated, at last providing Zeppelin with a sound financial base for his experiments.Robinson 1973 p. 41.

Plot Percy Peiris (Wasantha Kotuwella) and his new wife, Princy (Indira Jonklas), are on their honeymoon in the wet zone at an isolated guesthouse. There, Percy starts having violent hallucinations in the form of flashbacks every time he tries to become intimate with Princy. After their short lived and physically devoid honeymoon, Percy and Princy return to Percy's family home where he lives with his half-paralyzed mother. On the way home, Princy asks to stop at a church. Percy obliges then leaves her there and drives off. This is where she meets Father Martin (Winston Serasinghe), who makes sure she gets home safely. The next morning Father Martin comes to the Peries' house to see Princy. He explains that Percy's odd behavior is either a mental disorder or a bad spirit has entered him. He suggests that Princy gets the old house for bad spirits. The violent emotional attacks escalate‚ÄîPercy refuses to go to work, and when he finds that Princy has sent their servant, Michael, to watch over him, this sends him into a rage. With no options, Princy turns to Father Michael, who asks that Percy see another priest who specializes in exorcisms. The apparently successful exorcism encourages Princy to attempt consummating their marriage. The attempt fails, which drives Princy to her mother. Princy asks her mother what she should do about this hurtful and bizarre behavior, and her mother tells her that she can't leave him. Percy realizes that Princy is gone, which triggers violence against his servant Michael. Soon after, Percy goes to the office and ends up setting papers on fire after his secretary makes some well-intentioned jokes about married life. Driving at night, Percy picks up a hitchhiker. The conversation leads to wives and girlfriends, sparking the most violent act‚ÄîPercy throws the hitchhiker to the backseat, and as the man escapes the car, Percy crashes, breaking his glasses and injuring his eye. The police find Percy and get him to a hospital. They are able to save his eye. Princy visits him, and the doctor (Simon Navagattegama) tells her that Percy needs to undergo a psychological evaluation before he is released to explain how the accident happened. It is revealed that as a child, Percy walked in on his parents having sex and his father (Gamini Haththotuwegama) beat him severely for it, scarring his psyche and ruining his ability to be intimate with his wife. Percy and Princy leave the hospital, but he stealthily escapes her watch. She goes home hoping he will show up. Percy ends up at a hotel, drinking with a shady man. He gives him some information and the man shows up at the Peiris' house. He asks to speak to Percy, who obviously is not there, in order to scope out the scene. When Princy asks what he wants, he starts speaking in tongues, putting Princy on edge. It is this final act that allows Princy to decide to leave. As she says goodbye to Mrs. Peiris, Percy comes home. Percy kills Michael, and starts looking for Princy. He follows images from his hallucinations‚Äîa seductive Princy and his younger self‚Äîuntil he comes across his wife hanging from the ceiling. He breaks down.

John, 437 U.S. 634 (1978), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that lands designated as a reservation in Mississippi are \\"Indian country\\" as defined by statute, although the reservation was established nearly a century after Indian removal and related treaties. The court ruled that, under the Major Crimes Act, the State has no jurisdiction to try a Native American for crimes covered by that act that occurred on reservation land.United States v. John, .  Background   History  Original Choctaw territory in Mississippi The Choctaw lived in Mississippi and other areas of the Southeast since well before the Revolutionary War, and were recognized by their treaty with the United States in 1786. When Mississippi became a state in 1817, the Choctaw still held three-quarters of the land in the state. There was pressure from European Americans on the federal government and state to open these lands for white settlement. Federal policy at that time was to encourage the removal of the Choctaw and other Native Americans to Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River, in what became present-day Oklahoma. In 1820 and again in 1830, the tribe signed two treaties ceding almost all of their land in Mississippi to the United States. By 1835, most of the tribe had been removed to the Indian Territory, but many members stayed in Mississippi.Rowland L. Young, Supreme Court Report (1978). In the 1890s the federal government became aware that not all the Choctaw had left. By 1916, the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) began to set aside funds to provide for some of the needs of the tribe. In the 1930s, the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration encouraged the revival of Native American tribes with the passage of the Indian Reorganization Act. In 1939 Congress authorized funds to provide a reservation for what was to become the federally recognized Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians.Young, supra at 1425. In 1944, the Secretary of the Interior set aside as an Indian reservation.Young, supra at 1425.  Major Crimes Act  Crow Dog Because Native American tribes were considered sovereign, crimes committed by Indians against Indians were not subject to federal or state jurisdiction, but were handled by tribal law. In 1881, a Brul√© Sioux named Crow Dog shot an killed another Indian, Spotted Tail, on the Great Sioux Reservation in South Dakota. Crow Dog was tried in federal court for murder, found guilty, and was sentenced to hang. He petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus to the Supreme Court. In Ex Parte Crow Dog, the Supreme Court found that the federal government did not have jurisdiction to try the case. Crow Dog was ordered released, having made restitution under tribal law to Spotted Tail's family, as was considered acceptable within the tribe. In response to Ex Parte Crow Dog, Congress passed the Major Crimes Act in 1885.Major Crimes Act of 1835, Mar. 3, 1885, (codified as amended as et seq. The Act provided that the federal government had exclusive jurisdiction over certain Indian on Indian crimes when the crimes were committed in \\"Indian country.\\" et seq.; Allison M. Dussias, Heeding the Demands of Justice: Justice Blackmun's Indian Law Opinions (1995). In 1886, the Act was upheld by the Supreme Court in United States v. Kagama.  Procedural history  In October 1975, Smith John and his son, Harry Smith John were indicted for assault with intent to commit the murder of Artis Jenkins.Young, supra at 1425; Dussias, supra at 88. All of the parties were Choctaw, and the assault occurred on the reservation. Both John and his son were tried in the Federal District Court and convicted of simple assault.Dussias, supra at 88. John was sentenced to 90 days in jail and a $300 fine.Young, supra at 1425. Subsequent to that trial, John and his son were indicted by a state grand jury in Leake County, Mississippi for aggravated assault, based on the same facts.Young, supra at Dussias, supra at 88. John objected to state jurisdiction, which was denied. He was convicted and sentenced to two years in the state prison.Young, supra at 1425. John appealed both convictions. In May 1997, the Mississippi Supreme Court determined that the Indian title to the land was extinguished under the removal treaties. Under the treaties, the Mississippi Constitution, and Mississippi statutes, the Choctaw who remained in the state after removal became citizens of the United States and Mississippi, and thus subject to state law. Because of this, the state ruled that the reservation land in Mississippi is not sovereign \\"Indian country.\\" Following this ruling, the Fifth Circuit Court came to the same conclusion. It reversed the federal conviction on the grounds that the district court lacked jurisdiction.Young, supra at 1425. The United States appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which granted certiorari to hear the cases.  U.S. Supreme Court   Arguments  = United States = The United States was represented by H. Bartow Farr III. The United States argued that the reservation land, where the crime was committed, was undisputably land purchased by the federal government in 1939 and held in trust from 1944 as an Indian reservation for the Mississippi Choctaw tribe. By the plain text of the statute, this gives the U.S. District Court jurisdiction, since the lands were \\"within the limits of [an] Indian reservation.\\" Even if, for the sake of argument, the United States had relinquished jurisdiction following the Indian Removal Act, Congress has plenary power under the U.S. Constitution's Indian Commerce Clause to alter treaty terms and reassert jurisdiction. Finally, Congress has the right to assert jurisdiction over federal land under the Property Clause of the Constitution.Pet'r's Br., available at 1978 WL 207092 (U.S.) (Appellate Brief). = State of Mississippi = The State of Mississippi was represented by Carl F. Andre. Mississippi argued that the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek ended the federal oversight of Choctaw Indians who remained in the state after 1833. The state claimed that \\"Mississippi Choctaw citizens did not become a tribe, did not live on a reservation in Indian country, and did not become wards of the federal government as a result of the Indian Reorganization Act (1934) and a proclamation of the Department of Interior (1944).\\" Since they are not tribal members, the provisions of the Major Crimes Act do not apply, and the state has jurisdiction.Br. of Miss., available at 1978 WL 223443 (U.S.) (Appellate Brief). = Smith John = John was represented by Richard B. Collins. John argued that Mississippi could not rely on the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek, as the entire treaty, with the exception of the land cessation, had been breached by the government in other actions. The superseding treaty of 1855 rendered the 1830 treaty irrelevant.Br. of John, available at 1978 WL 223444 (U.S.) (Appellate Brief). = Amicus curiae = Amicus curiae briefs were filed in support of John and the United States by the Association on American Indian Affairs and the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians. No briefs were filed in support of Mississippi.  Opinion of the Court  Justice Harry Blackmun, author of the unanimous opinion Justice Harry Blackmun delivered the opinion of a unanimous court. Blackmun noted that the definition of Indian country in the statute included three separate types of land, and reservation land was applicable to this case.John, 437 U.S. at 648. The test for determining if land was reservation land was if the land in question ‚Äúhad been validly set apart for the use of the Indians as such, under the superintendence of the Government.‚ÄùJohn, 437 U.S. at 649 (internal citations omitted); Leonhard, supra at 681. Blackmun observed that Congress declared that the lands were held in trust for the Mississippi Choctaw in 1939, and that this was further clarified in 1944 when the land was declared to be their reservation.John 437 U.S. at 649-50; Young, supra at 1425; Leonhard, supra at 681; Dussias, supra at 88. He said that the reliance of both Mississippi and the Fifth Circuit that the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek ended the status of the Mississippi Choctaw as Indians was misplaced, as the Indian Commerce Clause still granted Congress the authority to deal with them.John, 437 U.S. at 650; Warren Stapleton, Indian Country, Federal Justice: Is the Exercise of Federal Jurisdiction Under the Major Crimes Act Constitutional? (1997). Since the land in question is an Indian reservation, ¬ß 1153 applies. The federal government has exclusive jurisdiction over the crime in question, and the State of Mississippi is without jurisdiction.Dussias, supra at 88. The ruling reversed and remanded the decision of the Fifth Circuit, and reversed the decision of the Mississippi Supreme Court.John 437 U.S. at 654; Young, supra at 1425.  Subsequent developments  Nearly a decade later the Mississippi Choctaw tribe litigated an Indian adoption case, Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians v. Holyfield, under the recently passed Indian Child Welfare Act.Solangel Maldonado, Race, Culture, and Adoption: Lessons from Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians v. Holyfield (2008). That act gave tribal courts exclusive jurisdiction on adoptions in which the child's parents lived on a reservation. The Mississippi Supreme Court had denied the tribal court's jurisdiction and found for the Holyfields, non-Choctaw who had adopted a child removed from the family. The tribe took it to the U.S. Supreme Court and won; this ruling gave federally recognized Native American tribes more control over the future of their children whose parents lived on reservations.Maldonado, supra at 12-14. The John decision has also influenced decisions on other civil issues in the late 20th century, such as taxation. In two Supreme Court cases from Oklahoma dealing with state taxation of Indians, the Court referred to its decision in John to declare that trust land was classified as being in \\"Indian country\\", where the state had no authority to tax Indians.Judith V. Royster, Decontextualizing Federal Indian Law: The Supreme Court's 1997-98 Term (1999).

He submitted his resignation on 10 August 2020 in wake of the 2020 Beirut explosion and has since served as Caretaker Prime Minister until a successor forms a new government. He was appointed by Lebanese President Michel Aoun on 19 December 2019 to succeed Saad Hariri, amidst the 2019‚Äì20 Lebanese protests that had caused Hariri's resignation. Prior to his premiership, he served as the Minister of Education from June 2011 to February 2014 under President Michel Suleiman. Early life and education Diab was born in Beirut on 6 January 1959. He has a bachelor of science degree in communications engineering, which he received from Leeds Metropolitan University in 1981. Then he obtained a master's degree in systems engineering from the University of Surrey in 1982, and a PhD in computer engineering from the University of Bath in 1985. Academic career Diab was a career academic, joining the American University of Beirut as an electrical engineering professor in 1985. He has published over 150 articles and papers in scientific journals and scientific conferences. He called himself an advocate for educational reform in Lebanon and authored books on the topic. He also served as vice president for regional external programs at the AUB from October 2006 to June 2011. On 13 June 2011, Diab was appointed minister of education and higher education as part of Najib Mikati's cabinet, replacing Hasan Mneimneh. He was succeeded by Elias Abu Saab as education minister. Diab's term ended on 15 February 2014. Political career Diab was designated as the next Prime Minister of Lebanon succeeding Saad Hariri on 19 December 2019, amidst the 2019‚Äì20 Lebanese protests that had caused Hariri's resignation. Diab's candidacy won the support of 69 members out of 128 of the Lebanese parliament; his support came from parties that co-form the March 8 Alliance, namely the Hezbollah-allied parliamentary blocs, but did not receive the backing of parties from his own Sunni community. Diab is an independent, not vocally supporting any political group, and had a low public profile at the time of his appointment. Lebanon's new government was formed on 21 January 2020 after Diab and Speaker Nabih Berri met with President Michel Aoun. Diab then announced the new twenty-member cabinet made up of technocrats saying they would work on new election law, seeking an independent judiciary and the return of looted public funds. During the first session of the new cabinet, Diab announced that his first official visits would be to countries \\"in the Arab region, especially the Gulf\\". He said nothing about abiding by the reforms promised by Hariri and chose to maintain the Ministry of Information, which Hariri had promised to abolish. On 3 February, Diab signed the 2020 state budget, reducing spending by $700 million and on 6 February the cabinet approved a financial rescue plan to present to the parliament. On 7 March 2020, Diab announced Lebanon would default on a sovereign debt for the first time in its history. On 10 August 2020, Diab resigned in the aftermath of the Beirut explosion due to mounting political pressure and anger at the Lebanese government for their failure to prevent the disaster, exacerbated by existing political tensions and upheavals within the country. He requested President Aoun to call for early parliamentary elections. He will continue to remain in office until a new government is formed. Personal life Diab is married to Nuwar Mawlawi and has three children. He is a Sunni Muslim.

Its territory is now part of the Moskovsky District of Kaliningrad, Russia. History The name Nasser Garten name means \\"wet garden\\" in German, referring to the watered area it was located in south of the river Pregel. The K√∂nigsberg district Ponarth had a similar etymology. Nasser Garten originally belonged to the village of Haberberg and was documented by Caspar Hennenberger in 1595.Karl, p.111 In 1626 it was divided by the construction of K√∂nigsberg's Baroque city walls.Albinus, p. 221 The eastern section within the walls (Alter Nasser Garten) became known as Alter Garten (old garden), while the western unwalled section (Neuer Nasser Garten) was referred to as simply Nasser Garten.Boetticher, p. 392 In 1648 Caspar Stein referred to the village as In den Sandgraben. The Brandenburg Gate was the portal between the walled city and Nasser Garten. At the village's western edge was the Nasseng√§rter Gate, where Akzise taxes (octroi) were collected until the 19th century. Nasser Garteb was inhabited by peasants operating small vegetable farms and living in mostly single level neoclassical houses.M√ºhlpfordt, p. 103 The main roads in the village were Berliner Stra√üe, which contained the cemetery of Haberberg Church, and the eponymous road Nasser Garten. The village came under the administration of Kneiphof in 1743. The Prussian general Ernst von R√ºchel was criticized for ordering K√∂nigsberg's garrison to burn parts of Nasser Garten as French troops approached the city during the War of the Fourth Coalition.M√ºhlpfordt, p. 85 A skirmish between French and Prussian troops was fought near the Freudenkrug inn and the Nasseng√§rter Gate on 14 June 1807; the inn was subsequently honored.M√ºhlpfordt, p. 83 By the end of the 19th century, the Nasseng√§rter Gate was decorated with two brick columns; its hip roofed guardhouse was one of the oldest in K√∂nigsberg.Boetticher, p. 393 The majority of the Fu√ü- Artillerie-Regiment Nr 1 (von Linger) was barracked along Karlstra√üe, with the remainder based near the Friedland Gate. Nasser Garten was separated from the Pregel meadows by a levee known alternately as the Poetensteig, Nasseng√§rter Damm, and Poeten-Damm.Jung, p. 36 It is disputed whether the levee was named after the poet Simon Dach. The area north of the levee would often flood in springtime and have to be drained by post mills propelled by horses; Johann Karl Friedrich Rosenkranz described the process in his K√∂nigsberg Skizzen.Gause, p. 393 The levee had to be rebuilt after a flood on 12 February 1894.Zweck, p. 71 By the 20th century Nasser Garten was bordered by Contienen to the west, the industrial harbors on the Pregel to the north, Haberberg to the east, the central train station to the southeast, and the Vorst√§dtische Wiesen meadowland to the south. Beyond the meadows was Ponarth. Nasser Garten lost much of its farmland during the construction of K√∂nigsberg's modern harbors in the 1920s.Gause III, p. 50 Notes References  *Karl, G. (1924).

The composition is in the key of Db and is noticeable for its chromatic descending chord sequences. The original score was adapted by Miles Davis in 1950, who created an arrangement that kept Shearing's chord changes and main theme, but replaced the composition's bridge and ending with new melodic material. This arrangement is documented on a February 1950 broadcast recording in New York City featuring Stan Getz, J.J. Johnson, and Art Blakey. Davis recorded this same arrangement in October 1951 for his first LP, The New Sounds (Prestige Records, 1951). Davis also did a complete rewrite of 'Conception' (creating an entire new main theme) for his Birth of the Cool nonet, giving the composition the title 'Deception'. 'Deception' retains the rewritten bridge melody from Davis' 'Conception' arrangement, as well as Shearing's original chord progression. Davis's nonet recorded 'Deception' in March 1950. Shearing's original composition was later recorded Bud Powell and Kurt Rosenwinkel. Miles Davis' 'Conception' arrangement was frequently played and recorded by Chet Baker. Authorship Bud Powell biographer Peter Pullman has written that bassist Al McKibbon, clarinetist Buddy DeFranco, composer and saxophonist Gil Melle, and pianist Claude Williamson, all of whom were professional modern jazz musicians in New York City in the early 1950s, have stated in interviews that pianist Bud Powell composed some or all of 'Conception', and that Shearing heard and adapted Powell's work. John Coltrane biographer and jazz pianist Lewis Porter disagrees, and has argued that 'Conception' is likely the work of Shearing. Porter notes that Shearing's later commercial success and turn from bebop to \\"middle of the road\\" instrumental music could have influenced the memories and opinions of the musicians that Pullman cites for evidence. Porter also notes that Shearing moved to New York City in 1947 and immediately immersed himself in the bebop community, writing a handful of bebop pieces prior to 'Conception' that are stylistically similar. These pieces include 'Delayed Action', 'Bop's Your Uncle', and 'Trixie', and their authorship has not been challenged. While Miles Davis immediately adopted 'Conception' into his repertoire upon its initial publication, no record exists of Powell playing the composition or any of its motifs until 1953. Unlike Davis, Powell played the original published bridge melody of the composition on his live 1953 live recording and his 1955 studio recording for Norgran Records, though this neither proves nor disproves Shearing's authorship.

Until 1947, it was known by its German language name Ponarth as first a suburb of and then a quarter of K√∂nigsberg, Germany, located southwest of the city center. History Ponarth was known in the Middle Ages as Penarth and was located in a forest known as the Penarthsches Wald.Karl, p. 88 The name was of Old Prussian origin (pa nartas or po nariatas) and referred to the wetlands of the Pregel River basin, similar to Nasser Garten to the north. First mentioned under the jurisdiction of the Schulze Conrad in 1328, it was documented as a German village with Kulm law in 1385 as part of the state of the Teutonic Order.M√ºhlpfordt, p. 112 In 1467 it was granted to Mathes Scheunemann, a licentiate employed by the Teutonic Knights. In 1482 Ponarth passed to Kunz Pfersfelder, a mercenary captain from Karschau.Gause II, p. 398 Ponarth had to be rebuilt after being burned down by Polish troops during the 1520 Horsemen's War.Albinus, p. 246 In 1599 it passed to Albrecht von Kittlitz, who exchanged it with Duke George Frederick. In 1609 Duke John Sigismund granted Ponarth to the K√∂nigsberg town of L√∂benicht. In 1679 Ponarth's houses were dismantled during the approach of Swedish troops (see Great Sleigh Drive). For the price of a D√ºttchen, a type of Silbergroschen, K√∂nigsberg citizens could take a D√ºttchenpost carriage from the city gates to surrounding suburbs.Frischbier, p. 161 Ponarth and the Karschau heathland became popular sites for excursions ca. 1790, with citizens drinking coffee amongst its linden trees. The French corps of Marshal Davout stayed in the village in 1812. The farming village Ponarth grew rapidly into a working class suburb through late 19th century industrialization;Reicke, pp. 46, 64 a Hauptwerkstatt of the Prussian Eastern Railway was built in eastern Ponarth. Johann Philipp Schifferdecker moved his small Bavarian-style brewery from L√∂benicht's Tuchmacherstra√üe to Ponarth in 1849; it became an Aktiengesellschaft in 1869. The Aktien-Gesellschaft Brauerei Ponarth grew into one of the largest breweries in northern Germany. Nearby Sch√∂nbusch, which also had its own brewery, was added to Ponarth on 14 October 1893. Ponarth also contained an artillery depot affiliated with the shooting range in nearby Karschau.Gause II, p. 650 By 1902 Ponarth was connected by roads to Nasser Garten and central K√∂nigsberg to the north, Speichersdorf to the east, Karschau to the south, and Sch√∂nbusch.Zweck, p. 82 Other nearby quarters were Prappeln to the southwest, Spandienen to the west, and Aweiden to the southeast. Previously part of the rural district of K√∂nigsberg (Landkreis K√∂nigsberg i. Pr.), Ponarth was merged into the urban district of K√∂nigsberg (Stadtkreis K√∂nigsberg i. Pr) in 1905. Ponarth's wooded park contained a bar known as M√ºllers Garten, known after 1900 as S√ºdpark. The landscape was improved through development of the ponds Hubertusteich and Schwanenteich, and the park Friedrichsruh. Two large housing developments were built in 1912. Churches in the quarter included the Ponarth Church for Lutherans, St. Joseph's Church for Catholics, and the Baptistenkirche for Baptists. The athletics club MTV Ponarth played its home games in Ponarth. K√∂nigsberg was transferred to Soviet control in 1945 after World War II. K√∂nigsberg was subsequently renamed to Kaliningrad and Ponarth to Dimitrovo.

It offers 75 guest rooms on six floors of a Romanesque revival building. Opening in 1997, The Mercer is the sister hotel to Hollywood's Chateau Marmont. __NOTOC__  History  Built in 1890 for John Jacob Astor II, the six-story, 84,000 square foot brick building has been cited by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission as an example of the Romanesque Revival period. Architect William Schickel, known for his extensive work on behalf of the Archdiocese of New York, designed the building as offices for the vast Astor family holdings, resulting in a fa√ßade considerably more ornate than its industrial neighbors. Prior to its conversion, the building served as artists' lofts and studios, for which the hotel has now become known.  Design  The overall aesthetic allows The Mercer to be \\"the first hotel to offer an authentic taste of loft living\\", an urban signature that is completely original to New York. Parisian designer Christian Liaigre ensured all furnishings were kept original and exclusive to the hotel. Liaigre created a modernist interior with an emphasis on harmonized proportions and subtle color palettes.  The Mercer Kitchen  In 1998, The Mercer Kitchen opened as a 170-seat restaurant located over two levels of The Mercer hotel. Chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten was recruited by Andr√© Balazs as the head of restaurant and food service for the property. The Mercer Kitchen, adjacent to the hotel lobby, has a 40-seat street-level caf√©. The lower level features a 160-seat main dining room that lies beneath the streets of SoHo.

He was editor of Science News Letter, the publication of Science Service, an organization established by the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the National Academy of Science, and the National Research Council in 1920. His longstanding interest in attracting young people to science was noted by, among others, President Lyndon B. Johnson; President Johnson said in 1966 that Watson had \\"awakened the minds and directed the energies of millions of young Americans toward the achievements in research and technology which are increasingly vital to human progress.\\" He founded, in his capacity as Director of Science Service, the Science Clubs of America, reaching at one point roughly a million school-age children across the United States; he also was one of the originators of the Westinghouse Science Talent Search and the International Science Fair. Nobel Laureate Glenn T. Seaborg, chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, who eulogized Watson in 1967, noted that \\"Watson Davis has done more for the popularization of science and the understanding of science by the general public than any other one individual.\\" In August 1937, Watson chaired the American delegation to the World Congress of Universal Documentation, held in Paris, France. At that event, Watson touted microfilm as a powerful means of information interchange: \\"[Microfilm] will supplement other forms of publication and make accessible material of all sorts that can not now be printed because of economic factors. It will make available out-of-print and rare books. It is adapted to the publication of photographs and other illustrations.... In this way the document is perpetually 'in print' but no extensive, space-consuming stocks need be stored, only the document itself and the microfilm negative from which positives are made for distribution.‚Äù He also proposed at this conference that newspapers be archived on microfilm, as opposed to being stored as physical copies.

Clark for the duo's 2012 album The Mighty Death Pop! A music video was filmed in June 2012, directed by the Deka Brothers. The album's concept \\"teaches us to respect the life we‚Äôve been given and do our best to avoid an early death.\\" The song was named after the professional wrestler, who died in a murder- suicide after killing his wife and son. A remix of the song appeared on the remix album Mike E. Clark's Extra Pop Emporium, and featured rappers Ice Cube and Scarface. Music and lyrics Professional wrestler Chris Benoit, whose double murder and suicide inspired the song. Inspiration for the song came from wrestler Chris Benoit, who murdered his wife and son before committing suicide. Insane Clown Posse broadly alluded to the murders in the song's lyrics, but the focus of the song is not the murders themselves, but of suddenly losing one's sanity, and eclipsing in violence. The song pertains to the album's overall concept, which \\"teaches us to respect the life we've been given and do our best to avoid an early death.\\" The song was remixed by Kuma for the remix album Mike E. Clark's Extra Pop Emporium. The remix featured additional verses by Ice Cube and Scarface. Music video The music video for \\"Chris Benoit\\" was filmed in June 2012, 5 years after the Chris Benoit murders took place. It was the first music video from The Mighty Death Pop! Violent J allowed French directors the Deka Brothers to exercise creative control over the video, with ICP's only input being a request for \\"minimal wrestling scenes\\" and \\"plenty of slow-motion, blur and artsy abstraction\\". Also in the video there were a few stock picture flashes of Chris Benoit himself. Violent J wanted the video to look like those made by Nirvana and was impressed with the Deka Brothers' work on Skrillex's First of the Year (Equinox). The music video aired on July 26‚Äì27, 2012 during a live episode of Violent J's \\"The Witching Hours\\" on Psychopathic Radio. The music video was later released on the Psychopathic Records YouTube channel. Reception The Houston Press criticized the song, suggesting that it glorified the wrestler's murders.http://blogs.houstonpress.com/rocks/2012/08/insane_clown_posse_benoit.php Spin said that the song uses the wrestler's psyche \\"to stare into the void\\". Graveside Entertainment cited \\"Chris Benoit\\" as a standout of the Mighty Death Pop!, calling it one of Insane Clown Posse's darkest songs, writing \\"ICP wisely took a more subtle approach focusing on the mind state someone like Benoit may have had during and after the act and it works extremely well.\\" References External links * Official website Category:2012 singles Category:Insane Clown Posse songs Category:Horrorcore songs Category:Songs about death Category:Cultural depictions of American men Category:2012 songs Category:Cultural depictions of professional wrestlers ","title":"Chris Benoit (song)"},{"id":"37966541","text":"2003 edition of Writers' & Artists' Yearbook Writers' & Artists' Yearbook is an annual directory for writers, designers, illustrators and photographers.

It is the first FDA-approved drug for the treatment of pseudobulbar affect (PBA). Clinical studies In a 12-week randomized, double-blind trial, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis patients with significant PBA were given either Nuedexta 20/10 mg or placebo. In 326 randomized patients, the PBA-episode daily rate was 46.9% (p < 0.0001) lower for Nuedexta than for placebo. The three deaths in each of the two drug treatment arms and the single death in the placebo arm of the study were believed to be due to the natural course of the disease. Nuedexta was approved in February 2011 and is marketed in the United States by Avanir Pharmaceuticals. Those seemingly unrelated drugs became associated so that low-dose quinidine inhibits dextromethorphan's breakdown. The latter has shown marginal efficacy in pseudobulbar syndrome due to rapid first-pass metabolism that reduces its bioavailability.

For the 2015 season, Joppie headed back to the Double-A Portland Sea Dogs for his tenth and final year with the Boston Red Sox organization. As a batting coach during his Boston tenure, Joppie has been credited for the development of players such as Josh Reddick (2008‚Äì2009), Ryan Kalish (2009‚Äì2010), Daniel Nava (2009), Ryan Lavarnway (2010‚Äì2011), Anthony Rizzo (2010), Will Middlebrooks (2011), Xander Bogaerts (2012-2013), Jackie Bradley Jr. (2012-2014) and Mookie Betts (2014).

He is Partner, Head of Merchant Banking at Alvarium Investments. His appointment followed the merger in March 2019 of Lepe Partners, the merchant bank he co-founded in 2011, with Alvarium which works across North America, Europe and Asia Pacific, supervising $15bn+ of assets. With Brent Hoberman, Goodwin also co-founded Founders Forum, a network of digital entrepreneurs, corporate CEOs and senior investors. Goodwin is Treasurer of the Centre for Policy Studies and a member of the Advisory Board on Planning and Development at the Victoria and Albert Museum. He is a former head of the investment pillar of the British Fashion Council. He has advised on more than 100 media deals, together worth over $20 billion. They include Chris Evans' purchase of Virgin Radio, the sale of Friends Reunited to ITV, the sale of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire and the merger of property websites Findaproperty.com, Primelocation.com and Zoopla. Recent M&A; advisory projects include News Corps' ¬£220m purchase of Wireless Group plc. He was awarded an OBE in 2018 for services to the economy.  Early career  After graduating from the University of Nottingham, Goodwin worked briefly at Coopers and Lybrand, where for one assignment he was asked to compile two reports. One report was to be on a \\"fascinating\\" proposed deal in the media sector, the other involved research into car component manufacturers; at that moment Goodwin realised he would \\"...prefer castration\\" to car parts: ‚ÄúEvery deal I‚Äôve worked on has been in and around the media sector since then,‚Äù he told The Telegraph in 2012. Goodwin then spent a year at private equity group Apax Partners, before leaving to join a News Corporation/Liberty Media-backed buyout of Talk Radio in 1997. He was appointed managing director of Talk Radio, which went on to become the foundation for The Wireless Group PLC, for which Goodwin was Group managing director under Kelvin Mackenzie. In 2000 Goodwin and Julian Culhane co-founded LongAcre Partners, a corporate finance boutique. LongAcre worked with Elisabeth Murdoch, helping to build her TV production business Shine via a series of acquisitions. LongAcre was also involved in the ¬£175m sale of Friends Reunited to ITV. LongAcre's investors included the law firm Olswang and private equity house Corsair. In 2007 LongAcre was sold to US investment bank Jefferies. Goodwin remained at Jeffries as Head of Global Technology, Media and Telecommunications until 2010.  Lepe Partners  In 2011 Goodwin and Culhane co-founded Lepe Partners, a merchant bank focused on the media internet and technology sectors. The company was named after a hamlet and beach in Hampshire where Goodwin spends his weekends. In addition to its advisory work, Lepe operated a venture growth fund which provided capital and strategic support to late stage venture growth opportunities in industry verticals. The fund was structured as a pledge fund based on annual commitments. Its portfolio included: Pharmacy2U, Boat International Media, CreativeLive, Masabi, and Festicket. The fund exited its investment in Wahanda (now Treatwell) in 2015, following a sale of the business to Recruit Holding. Lepe also advised on investment deals for News Corp, Ministry of Sound and TalkTalk. In 2019 Lepe Partners merged with Alvarium.  Founders Forum  In 2006 Goodwin and Hoberman created Founders Forum, a network for digital entrepreneurs, corporate CEOs and senior investors. The Forum has 1500 members and has become known as a Europe-based equivalent of Sun Valley, the Allen & Co retreat for media executives in the US. Speakers and attendees at previous Forum meetings include Sir Richard Branson, Arianna Huffington, Eric Schmidt, Reid Hoffman, Sean Parker, Niklas Zennstrom, Mikitani Hiroshi, Ben Horowitz, Natalie Massenet, Charles Dunstone, Tony Fadell, Natalie Vodianova, Jessica Alba, Peter Gabriel, Ashton Kutcher, Jeffrey Katzenberg, Daniel Ek and Ari Emanuel. Events are currently held in London, Paris, Madrid, Istanbul, Los Angeles, New York City, Rio de Janeiro, Mumbai, New Delhi, Qingdao and Singapore. In 2013 the Financial Times announced a media partnership with the Forum, presenting two awards at that year's London event. Also in 2013, Founders Forum and the British Government's UK Trade & Investment arm created the Technology Innovators' Forum (TIF-IN), which connects new UK businesses with influential heads of content, media and finance companies worldwide. In 2009 Goodwin, Hoberman and other partners co-founded PROfounders Capital, an early stage fund backed by entrepreneurs for digital entrepreneurs. One of its first investments was UK-based TweetDeck, the online application sold two years later to Twitter for $40m. Founders Forum has launched a number of initiatives under the Founders aegis, including the executive search arm Founders Keepers and the strategic consultancy Founders Intelligence.  Philanthropy   Founders Pledge  In June 2015 Goodwin co-launched Founders Pledge, a UK- and US-registered charity to enable tech entrepreneurs to commit to donating at least 2% of their personal proceeds to philanthropic causes upon exit.[1] Founders Pledge's declared mission is to \\"...strip down the barriers to charitable giving, making it easy for technology entrepreneurs to give back to society.\\" The Pledge's service is paid for by sponsors, partners, and private donors, and is offered free to entrepreneurs. Founders Pledge also offers post-exit support, including charity sourcing, due diligence and impact reporting. At launch, ¬£18.5m was pledged by leaders of 50 UK technology companies, including Alex Depledge of Hassle.com, Jos√© Neves of Farfetch, Ben Medlock from SwiftKey and James Alexander of Zopa. Founder's Pledge has facilitated the giving of $15.5 million to charities of donors' choices and has secured a further $180 million in legally binding pledges. In March 2016 Founders Pledge launched Founders of the Future, a philanthropic initiative that uses artificial intelligence and recommendations to uncover entrepreneurial talent in the 15‚Äì35 age group who are not currently founders. Founders Pledge has also entered partnerships with US seed accelerators MassChallenge and Y Combinator, to obtain pledges from their funded companies.  Founders Forum Foundation  Goodwin joined with Hoberman and lastminute.com co-founder Martha Lane Fox to develop the Founders Forum Foundation. The Foundation facilitates internships and scholarships to school- leavers from across the UK, to break down the barriers that Goodwin believes result in the majority of media and tech company leaders coming from privileged backgrounds. Goodwin also believes entrepreneurship can address the problems faced by young people, especially \\"NEETs\\" (\\"not in employment, education or training\\"). Goodwin is disparaging of large tech firms for not doing enough to engage with the UK communities in which they operate, and for failing to paying enough tax: ‚ÄúWe should be leaning on them harder to put more back into the country,‚Äù he told The Telegraph newspaper. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not talking about complicated tax structures ‚Äì we need to [encourage them] to put more back into the cities they're a part of. We're sometimes so afraid of our own shadow that they'll go somewhere else, but where are they going to go? If you want a [European] headquarters, London is the best place to be.\\"  Founders Forum for Good  In 2012 Founders Forum announced the launch of Founders Forum For Good. Led by Martha Lane-Fox and with Board members including Goodwin, Jimmy Wales and Mike Lynch, Founders Forum for Good's mission is to bring together digital entrepreneurs with the leaders of social and environmental organisations to tackle social issues and inequalities. In June 2013 the following year the Forum partnered with Nominet Trust to launch Social Tech, Social Change, a ¬£1m fund providing early-stage finance for social entrepreneurs.  Personal life  Goodwin is married to Flora Hesketh, the daughter of Alexander Fermor-Hesketh, 3rd Baron Hesketh, the former Conservative Party treasurer. Goodwin's hobbies include sailing. In 2012 he campaigned the J/109 Harlequin, becoming the overall winner at Cowes Week 2012 for both the White Group, J/109 group, and Cowes Week overall.

The Kenya Ceramic Jiko: A manual for stovemakers. Intermediate Technology Publications, 1991 It was from the re-designing of these two stoves that the Kenya Ceramic Jiko was created. Through the collaboration of both local and international organizations, the Kenya Ceramic Jiko evolved and took shape. Organizations such as CARE, UNICEF, The Bellerive Foundation, as well as the United States and German aid agencies all played a role in the development and promotion of the KCJ.Kammen, Daniel. ‚ÄúResearch, Development and Commercialisation of the Kenya Ceramic Jiko and other Improved Biomass Stoves in Africa.‚Äù Horizon Solutions Site. Accessed on 26 November 2012. Retrieved from The Kenya Energy and Environment Organization (KENGO) has played an active role in increasing awareness, and promoting the use of the Kenya Ceramic Jiko since 1982. Engineering To produce the Kenya Ceramic Jiko, two main materials are needed: clay to make the ceramic, and metal. The moulding of the stove is made from mild sheet metal, which can be attained from scrap metal such as that found in bitumen drums. For the sheet metal, the minimum required thickness is 0.5 mm, and the maximum is 0.8 mm. All joints in the metal frame are held together using either riveting or folding. For the pot-rest, a steel round bar between 7‚Äì8 mm in thickness should be used, while an 0.8 mm thick sheet metal should be used to create the pot-feet. The metal used to create the base of the stove can be even thinner, about 0.25 mm thick, as the ceramic inner lining protects it from direct contact with heat. The ceramic part of the stove is made with clay, which is shaped and then fired. The qualities for the ideal type of clay for use are: ability to maintain good strength when fired at 900 ¬∞C; ability to remain slightly porous when temperatures reach 1150 ¬∞C; the clay should not warp or change shape when fired at 1250 ¬∞C. When the clay is fired up, it should turn to a light pink to white colour, and, to reduce the likelihood of cracking, it should shrink less than 8% after being fired. Clay which meets all the above standards is generally referred to as a \\"fireclay\\". To produce the Kenya Ceramic Jiko, two types of skilled labour are needed, a metalworker, and a clay worker. Other than a hammer, all other tools needed to manufacture the Kenya Ceramic Jiko can be found from scraps or hand made. Health Open indoor combustion of wood, coal, charcoal, peat (virtually any plant matter) can lead to health problems. At the temperature of a normal fire, these materials \\"burn dirty,\\" wasting much of their potential fuel in the form of smoke. This incomplete combustion means that toxic gases (i.e., smoke, containing chemicals such as carbon monoxide, nitrous oxide, sulfur oxides) and particulate matter are blown up into the room's atmosphere. Sandhu, Sharanpal. ‚ÄúThe Kenya Ceramic Jiko.‚Äù Horizon Solutions Site for Kids. Accessed on 26 November 2012. Retrieved from * These gases and particles are clearly linked to increased risk of cancer and serious acute or chronic respiratory problems. The simplest way for people relying on open fires to reduce this risk may be to thoroughly dry (or dehydrate) fuel before burning it. The less water in the fuel, the hotter the fire, the cleaner the combustion, the cleaner the indoor air quality. Drying tinder is especially helpful, since wet tinder ‚Äì with no help from the heat of an established fire ‚Äì produces particularly harmful smoke. Environment In Kenya about 70% of energy consumed is from wood fuel, with 80% of the population dependent upon it.Walubergo, Dominic. ‚ÄúImproved Stove Programmes in Kenya.‚Äù World Environmental Liberty. Accessed on 26 November 2012. Retrieved from . Rural stove users typically burn wood directly, while the urban population tends to burn charcoal as fuel. The Kenyan Ministry of Energy and Regional Development estimated that, in 1986, the annual demand for wood as a fuel was 18.7 million tonnes, and growing at a rate of 3.6% per year. Cutting down trees for fuel has led to environmental degradation, including loss of forests, loss of biodiversity, destruction of habitats, and an increase in soil erosion. Reserves of wood were being exhausted by 40% more than the rate of replacement. Benefits When used properly, the Kenya Ceramic Jiko has the ability to reduce fuel consumption by 20‚Äì50%,Kammen, Daniel. Case Study 1.

He was going to make a vampire film starring an ex-girlfriend, Catherine Deneuve, but postponed it to make Night Games. Vadim said he was \\"looking for a new Vivien Leigh, about 27 years old\\" to star in the film. Part of the funding came from the Philippines and some of the movie was shot there. Other funding came from Raymond Chow of Golden Harvest. Pickett was a relative unknown when Vadim cast her for Night Games, best known for appearing for three years on Guiding Light. \\"I went away from the experience transformed\\", said Pickett. \\"Vadim has the power to make an actor feel so good about himself, and when that happens you grow. It's part of his magic.\\" Pickett later recalled: > Vadim had to fight to get me into the picture. Chow had wanted someone with > long hair and a big bosom ‚Äì another Bardot, presumably.

The territory is now part of the Tsentralny District of Kaliningrad, Russia. History Hufen's name was derived from the system of measurement Hufe, approximately 30 morgen. Under the control of Altstadt by 1286,Gause, p. 69 it was known as Huben by 1300.Albinus, p. 134 It originally extended north and west from Steindamm Gate. By 1710 Altstadt had foresters tending to the Kaporner Heath northwest of K√∂nigsberg, living along the Alte Pillauer Landstra√üe on the road to Pillau. Rich K√∂nigsbergers began to visit the countryside in summertime. By the end of the 18th century Hufen consisted of the estate Ratshof and the villages Vorderhufen (\\"near Hufen\\") in the north, Mittelhufen (\\"middle Hufen\\") in the northwest, and Hinterhufen (\\"further Hufen\\"), later known as Amalienau.Gause II, p. 404 Hardershof developed north of Mittelhufen in the early 19th century. In 1786 Theodor Gottlieb von Hippel the Elder established the Bohlenweg, a road allowing easier access to the estate Pojenter Hof (later the Luisenwahl Park). The Bohlenweg-Verein was an association of villa owners founded at the beginning of the 19th century. The theologian Ehregott Andreas Christoph Wasianski (July 3, 1755 - April 17, 1831), a friend and biographer of the great German philosopher Immanuel Kant, lived in what would become the Villa Hufenterrasse. In 1812 the Laufenhof manor was converted into the Villa Conradshof. Seven villas burned down in 1826. Hufen was connected to Lawsken in 1829 by the construction of a chaussee. Hufen increasingly developed into residential suburbs for K√∂nigsberg's high society and financiers; notable buildings included Etablissement Conradshof, Park Villa Nova, Villa Hufenpark, Hufenterrasse, Villa Bella, the Konditorei Amende, Birkenh√§uschen, Fortuna, Flora, Drachenfels, and Julchenthal. Amalienau was incorporated into the city of K√∂nigsberg (Stadtkreis K√∂nigsberg i. Pr) piecemeal on 3 June 1898 and 1 April 1905. Vorderhufen and Mittelhufen were also merged into the city on the latter date. The main thoroughfare through Hufen was Hufen-Allee, which became Kniprodestra√üe in Steindamm and Neurossgarten at its eastern extremity and extended west to K√∂nigsberg's outer suburbs, such as Metgethen and Moditten. Hufen's streets were the first in K√∂nigsberg to be uniformly named, often honoring noted personalities from the city's history.Gause II, p. 643 The Zahn√§rztliches Institut, a dental institute, opened on Alte Pillauer Landstra√üe in 1921 under the direction of Paul Adloff.Albinus, p. 324 While most of K√∂nigsberg was heavily damaged by the 1944 Bombing of K√∂nigsberg and the 1945 Battle of K√∂nigsberg, the quarters of Hufen were relatively unscathed by World War II and have been maintained in modern Kaliningrad.

The goal is to colonize newly-discovered planets, controlling the resources found there, and defend the colony against other rival factions. Reception According to Interplay, global sales of M.A.X. surpassed 150,000 copies by June 1998. M.A.X. was met with overwhelmingly positive reviews. Writing for Computer Gaming World, Patrick C. Miller called it \\"an uncommonly high quality game with excellent gameplay; challenging artificial intelligence; and considerable depth, variety, and replay value.\\" Next Generation similarly described it as \\"a sophisticated, challenging, and enjoyable strategy game with a great deal of replayability\\", while Kevin Mical of GameSpot deemed it superior to the critically acclaimed Command & Conquer. Critics widely praised the game's large number of gameplay modes and options to play with, huge variety of military units, and sound effects. Most were also pleased with the choice of real-time or turn-based play, though Miller added that he found the single-player campaign frustratingly difficult in real-time mode, since the AI can make decisions and perform actions faster than humanly possible. A more common subject of criticism was the instruction manual, which some reviewers stated is disorganized and omits key gameplay concepts. However, reviews generally commented that the training missions are well-designed and do a great deal to overcome the difficulty of learning the game. M.A.X. was a runner-up for Computer Game Entertainments 1996 \\"Best Strategy Game\\" prize, which ultimately went to Civilization II. The editors called M.A.X. \\"a fantastic science fiction exploration and conquest game that demonstrated anew how completely satisfying a turn-based strategy game could be in a decided shift towards real-time strategy gaming.\\" It was also nominated as Computer Games Strategy Pluss 1996 real-time strategy game of the year, although it lost to Command & Conquer: Red Alert. Legacy A sequel, Mechanized Assault & Exploration 2, was released in 1998. M.A.X. was re- released into digital distribution after years of non-availability on gog.com in September 2008.

It is a form of Dumpling in Superior Soup (), a dumpling with gelatinous broth inside. As with shark fin soup, the shark fin content is often replaced with an imitation. History Dumpling in Superior Soup () originated from Ming dynasty in Yangzhou. In that time, pigskin was a preferred ingredient of brewis. As pigskin is composed of collagen which is a main component of connective tissue, brewis would be solidified after it was dissolved, forming a gel-like structure. It would then be integrated into bread for consumption. According to the Qing dynasty cookbook Suiyuan shidan this is the ancestral form of dumpling in superior soup.È°õ‰∏çÊ£±Âç≥ËÇâÈ§É‰πüÔºåÁ≥äÈù¢Êé®ÈñãÔºåË£πËÇâÁÇ∫È§°Ëí∏‰πã„ÄÇÂÖ∂Ë®éÂ•ΩËôïÂÖ®Âú®‰ΩúÈ§°ÂæóÊ≥ïÔºå‰∏çÈÅéËÇâÂ´©ÂéªÁ≠ã‰ΩúÊñôËÄåÂ∑≤„ÄÇÈ§òÂà∞Âª£Êù±ÔºåÂêÉÂÆòÈéÆÂè∞È°õ‰∏çÊ£±ÔºåÁîö‰Ω≥Ôºå‰∏≠Áî®ËÇâÁöÆÁÖ®ËÜèÁÇ∫È§°ÔºåÊïÖË¶∫ËªüÁæé„ÄÇ, \\"what Dumpling in Soup is and how it is produced\\" - . The use of shark fin as an ingredient of dumplings appeared in the 1980s, when the economy of Hong Kong was growing rapidly. Part of the Chinese restaurants would like to produce something luxury so as to emphasize the class difference or attract consumers. As time went on, actual shark fin was sometimes replaced by thin bean noodle. Ingredients and preparation The standard ingredients include shark fin, meirou, shrimp, crab sticks, shiitake and straw mushrooms. The dish is prepared with red agar for texture, and seasoned with salt, MSG, sugar, meal-cake, and ground white pepper. With mass production commonly seen today, there can be a great variance from the traditional cooking method, quality, and ingredient composition. Reduction in filling quantity, cheaper raw materials, and substitution of ingredients is not uncommon. Chicken shreds can be replaced by ham shreds, prawn replaced by dried shrimp, mushroom varieties swapped, and the amount of shark's fin reduced. Evolution Over time, Hong Kong chefs have updated the classic recipe to appeal to customers. Some of these developments include: * Green Shark's Fin & Prawn Dumpling (Áø°Áø†È≠öÁøÖÁÅåÊπØÈ§É) in which the fin is mixed with vegetable juice during cooking for colour and flavour. * Shark's Fin & Prawn Dumpling with Bamboo Pith (Á´πÁ¨ôÈ≠öÁøÖÁÅåÊπØÈ§É) * Shark's Fin & Prawn Dumpling with crab-meat (ËüπËÇâÈ≠öÁøÖÁÅåÊπØÈ§É) * Vegetarian Shark's Fin & Prawn Dumpling (Á¥†ÁøÖÁÅåÊπØÈ§É) - Nowadays, Hong Kongers are more environmental friendly. Therefore, some of the restaurants use ‚Äôfake shark‚Äôs fin‚Äô to replace the shark's fin to avoid killing sharks in order to protect this species. The ‚Äôfake shark‚Äôs fin‚Äô is mainly made of Gelatin or Konjac, some of them may be made of the bean vermicelli. Since it does not include any animal's ingredients, it is also suitable for vegetarian. Other than that, it is cheaper than shark's fin; the production cost can be lower. Therefore, this shark's fin & prawn dumpling is one of example of adaptability. Restaurants In the past, shark's fin and prawn dumpling has traditionally been a luxury dim sum, with only a select number of dim sum establishments offering the dish. These restaurants used expensive materials to make the filling like plenty of shark's fin, chicken shreds, Shiitake mushrooms, prawn, pork, etc. The cooking method, time-consuming in nature, requires the soup to be filled into the dumpling then steamed in a bamboo steamer. As there is only one formal cooking method, fewer chiefs know how to make the dish in accordance with the traditional approach. Today, societal changes have affected the nature and availability of the dish. A growing number of people are wealthy enough to afford luxury cuisine, and growing competition in the catering industry has led to a proliferation in the types of dim sum available in Hong Kong. There are currently several variations of shark's fin & prawn dumpling, such as vegetarian options, to meet differences in customer preferences. Availability and popularity has also increased. Some stores sell take-out dim sum, and supermarkets commonly stock frozen versions of shark's fin and prawn dumpling.

Notable projects include the Bangladesh Solar Initiative, which provided solar power to over 2 million rural homes which were previously without electricity and lighting. Additionally, Iyer worked to increase electrification for thousands of rural poor in Senegal, Ethiopia, and Tanzania, and also implemented several biomass energy projects =Criticism= Despite the Bank's efforts to increase electrification, Iyer drew criticism from environmental policy advocates in 2014 for asserting that fossil fuels are a viable option to increase electrification for Africa's poor. In response, Iyer maintained that renewable options were cost prohibitive for many regions in Africa that had no access to energy, and that in order for these cost barriers to be removed, the economic growth that results from initial electrification must first be realized.

Its territory is now part of the Tsentralny District of Kaliningrad, Russia. History Amalienau originally contained the village Hinterhufen (further Hufen) in the western part of the Hufen region northwest of medieval K√∂nigsberg. By the middle of the 16th century it was largely deforested. As a result of the Prussian administrative reorganization following the Napoleonic Wars, the region was included within the rural district of K√∂nigsberg (Landkreis K√∂nigsberg i. Pr.), part of Regierungsbezirk K√∂nigsberg in East Prussia, on 1 February 1818. From 1810-20 the K√∂nigsberg commerce councilor Gustav Schnell purchased the various estates around Hinterhufen and united them into a single estate named after his wife, Amalie Schnell (n√©e Gramatzki).Albinus, p. 128 In 1858 Amalienau was raised to the status of an estate district (Gutsbezirk) by its owner, Anton Douglas (1817-83).Gause II, p. 404 Douglas was married to Charlotte Warschauer and was a brother-in-law of Eduard Simson. On 3 June 1898 parts of Amalienau were transferred from the rural district of K√∂nigsberg (Landkreis K√∂nigsberg i. Pr.) into the urban district of K√∂nigsberg (Stadtkreis K√∂nigsberg i. Pr). The remainder of Amalienau was finally incorporated into the city of K√∂nigsberg on 1 April 1905. Neighboring quarters were Ratshof to the west and Mittelhufen to the north and east. In 1898 Friedrich Heitmann and Joseph Kretschmann, architects and construction officials, founded the K√∂nigsberger Immobilien- und Baugesellschaft (K√∂nigsberg Real Estate and Building Company). In 1901 they began to develop Amalienau into a villa suburb (Villenvorort or Villenkolonie) for the upper class. North of Amalienau was the estate Klein Amalienau. Public squares in Amalienau and along the border with Mittelhufen included Skagerrakplatz, Friedrich-Wilhelm-Platz, Luisenplatz, and Ziethenplatz. Churches in the quarter included the Protestant K√∂nigin-Luise-Ged√§chtniskirche (1899) and the Roman Catholic St. Adalbert's (1902). The Zwillingsteich, consisting of two linked ponds, was created in 1909. An airship hangar was constructed in Amalienau in 1913. An old hammer forge was converted into a cafe and Gasthaus. The football club SV Prussia-Samland K√∂nigsberg played at Sportplatz Prussia- Samland on Steffeckstra√üe on the western outskirts of the quarter. While most of K√∂nigsberg was heavily damaged by the 1944 Bombing of K√∂nigsberg and the 1945 Battle of K√∂nigsberg, Amalienau emerged relatively unscathed from World War II, except for some damage to the two churches. Soviet officials often used Amalienau's villas after the war, with many of the buildings maintained in modern Kaliningrad.

Career In 1950, together with David Cairns, Gray established the Chelsea Opera Group. This was an organisation that produced concert performances of operas rather than staged productions because they were less expensive for the audiences. For their first performance they persuaded Colin Davis, at the time a 22-year-old clarinetist, to conduct a concert performance of Mozart‚Äôs Don Giovanni in the Holywell Music Room, Oxford. Gray played in the orchestra, and Cairns sang the role of Leporello. In 1957 the London Philharmonic Orchestra invited Gray to leave his career at the Bank of England to assist with managing its finances. Two years later Gray joined the Philharmonia Orchestra as an administrator. In 1964 he moved to Liverpool to become the manager of the Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra, a post he held until his retirement in 1987. During this time, the orchestra had five principal conductors, Sir Charles Groves (until 1977), Walter Weller (1977‚Äì80), David Atherton (1980‚Äì83), Marek Janowski (1983‚Äì87), and Libor Pe≈°ek (1987‚Äì97). Together with Sir Charles, Gray organised an annual conductors' seminar, in which young potential conductors worked with the orchestra for a fortnight. In 1972 Gray noticed the potential of Simon Rattle when, at the age of 17, he conducted the Merseyside Youth Orchestra in a performance of The Rite of Spring. Gray appointed Rattle as an associate conductor of the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra in 1977. When Gray retired in 1987, a concert was organised in which each of the five principal conductors, and Simon Rattle, took part. Following his retirement, Gray remained active, helping to the rescue the Bluecoat Society of Arts, who were based in the Bluecoat Chambers in Liverpool, from closure. Personal life Stephen Gray was born in Guildford, Surrey, England, and was the son of an Anglican clergyman. He was educated at Rugby School, where he took an active part in the school orchestra. After leaving school he worked at Bletchley Park, but he never disclosed what he did there. He studied classics at Trinity College, Oxford, then joined the Bank of England as a trainee. Gray married Frances, a member of the chorus of the Chelsea Opera Group, in 1953. Together they had a son and a daughter. Gray was appointed OBE in 1987.

It was known as the Oberteich while part of K√∂nigsberg, Germany, until 1945. The pond is elevated 22 metres above the Pregel River and encompasses 41.1 hectares. Freshwater life living in the Upper Pond include perch, roach, carp, tench, pike, and eels.Albinus, p. 228 Located near the water is the Kaliningrad Amber Museum. History The Upper Pond, then known as the Oberteich, was created in 1270 by the Teutonic Knights as a fishing pond north of medieval K√∂nigsberg. The levee separating it from the southern Schlossteich or Lower Pond eventually became the street Wrangelstra√üe. Part of the rural district of K√∂nigsberg (Landkreis K√∂nigsberg i. Pr.) since 1818, the Oberteich was incorporated into the city limits on 1 April 1882. Quarters of K√∂nigsberg in the vicinity of the pond included Hinterro√ügarten to the southeast, Hintertragheim to the southwest, Tragheimsdorf to the west, and Maraunenhof to the north. East of the Oberteich were gardens and the K√∂nigsberg horse racing track. Along its shores were public baths (Prussia Badeanstalt, KSC- Badeanstalt, Hansa-Badeanstalt), a military bath, and an angling club. The pond was transferred from Germany to the Soviet Union following World War II in 1945. The German consulate is located along the northern shore of the modern Upper Pond.

The Ludwig Tower in Bad Kissingen is located on the Staffelsberg, a hill in the German spa town of Bad Kissingen. The tower is to commemorate the House of Wittelsbach and, thus, named after Bavarian king Ludwig I of Bavaria. The tower belongs to the heritage registers of Bad Kissingen and has an entry in the List of Heritage Registers in Bavaria.  History  It was the then Lord Mayor of Bad Kissingen, Carl F√ºrst, who came up with the idea of building the Ludwig Tower. After a construction period of two years, the tower's unveiling took place on 29 August 1883 under Theobald von Fuchs, F√ºrst's successor as the Lord Mayor of Bad Kissingen. In 1912, a heightening of the tower was planned but never carried into effect. The tower became very popular as a look-out from the very beginning. However, it has meanwhile lost this status due to the many trees which have grown around the tower. Today, a training centre of the Diocese Union of the Pathfinders of St Georg from W√ºrzburg is to be found next to the tower. The Ludwig Tower has been in a ruinous state for several years and had to be closed for the public in 2008. In March 2012, the Town Council of Bad Kissingen announced that there is no possibility to finance a general reconstruction, which would cost ‚Ç¨120,000. It is also out of question to demolish the tower as, on the one hand, there is also no possibility to cover the demolition costs of ‚Ç¨40,000 and, on the other hand, the Ludwig Tower is landmarked.‚ÄûAuch T√ºrme leben gef√§hrlich‚Äú ‚Äì Article in the newspaper ‚ÄûSaale- Zeitung‚Äú, 20 March 2012  Architecture  The tower's ground area has a quadrate shape.

The Disease Control Priorities Project is a joint enterprise of a number of groups, including the University of Washington Department of Global Health, the World Bank, the Fogarty International Center (National Institutes of Health), World Health Organization, Population Reference Bureau, Gates Foundation, and the International Decision Support Initiative. Notable editors involved in the project include Dean Jamison, Alan Lopez, Colin Mathers, Christopher J.L. Murray, George Alleyne, Prabhat Jha, and Anne Mills. Publications DCP1 The first edition of Disease Control Priorities in Developing Countries, commonly referred to as DCP1, was published in 1993. DCP1 is cited in the 1993 World Development Report. DCP1 is organized into five parts: * Introduction * The Unfinished Agenda, I ¬∑ Infectious Disease * The Unfinished Agenda, II ¬∑ Reproductive Health and Malnutrition * Emerging Problems * Conclusion Each part has chapters within it; there are 29 chapters in all. The report spans more than 700 pages and has as contributors 79 authors in addition to the four editors.

Across Italy, it is one of the primary olives cultivars found in olive groves. It is believed to have originated in Tuscany, and it is now grown all over the world. Due to its delicate flavor, the olive oil it produces is commonly blended with Frantoio, Coratina, Moraiolo and Pendolino in order to create more flavor.  About the tree  The Leccino tree grows well in cooler climates, but is not as tolerant to heat as Spanish olive cultivars. The tree grows quickly and has a dense canopy. It tends to be highly productive in the right conditions and has a tendency to grow more like a tree than a bush, which is different from most olive trees. Average oil yield is 18-21% of the fruit. It is not self-pollinating and requires the presence of another cultivar, commonly Pendolino, in order to fruit. Synonyms Allorino (Leccino Pendulo), Allorino (Leccino Piangente), Grappuda, Prevoce Leccino, Colombina, Leccino LD (Leccino compact), Leccino LD (Leccino dwarf), Leccino 04, Leccino 13, Canneto Leccino (Leccino CLONE ISTEA 30), Leccino Collececco 22, Leccino di Belmonte, Leccino Ecotipo 2, Leccino Moricone, Leccino Pesciatino, Leccio, Lechino, Lucca, Toscano, and Verolana.  History  While it is unclear when the cultivar first appeared, written references can be found near the end of the Middle Ages, and the Leccino is generally one of the older cultivars from Italy. Leccino has made its appearance in other countries over the past 50 years with the growing popularity of olive oil. It's commonly grown in California, Chile and Australia among other olive oil growing regions.

He obtained his doctorate at the University of Madrid by researching the pathology of brain tumours. In 1913, he was funded to study research histology in France and Germany but the outbreak of war between them forced him to return to Spain. He worked with the histologist Santiago Ram√≥n y Cajal and briefly with Wilder Penfield. Ram√≥n y Cajal discovered neurons, Penfield helped explain oligodendroglia, whilst Rio Hortega discovered microglia, which are the cells that protect the brain from infection. He managed to identify microglia between 1919 and 1921 by staining the cells with silver carbonate. His method of staining also led to the discovery of oligodendroglia in 1921, which both he and Penfield are now credited with. However it was Rio Hortega who named the cells. His discoveries in 1920 created issues with Ram√≥n y Cajal, who led the lab, as he had earlier won the Nobel Prize.

In pre-Christian times the feast usually fell on the autumn equinox, in modern times it is usually celebrated on one of the Sundays following the end of the harvest season, which fall on different days in different regions of Europe. The feast was initially associated with the pagan Slavic cult of plants, trees and agriculture. In 16th century in Central and Eastern Europe it gained a Christian character and started to be organised by the landed gentry and more affluent peasants as a means to thank the reapers and their families for their work, both during the harvest and during the past year. While there are many regional varieties and traditions, most have some aspects in common. Often the peasants or farmers celebrating do≈ºynki gather in the fields outside their village, form a procession and bring back a sheaf or the last batch of cereal reaped from nearby fields. The women would then turn it into a wreath and offer it to the guest of honour (usually the organiser of the celebration: a local noble, the richest farmer in the village or ‚Äì in modern times ‚Äì the vogt or other representative of the authorities).  Names  In Poland, where the tradition survived to modern times, the feast and accompanying rituals are known under a variety of names depending on the region. The prevalent term is do≈ºynki, but wy≈ºynki, obrzynki, wieniec, wie≈Ñcowe, ≈ºniwniok or okrƒô≈ºne are also used in some areas. Similarly, in Belarus there are a variety of names in use, including the Feast of the Most Clean One (), Aspazha (), Haspazha (), Great Spazha (), Zelnya (), Talaka () and Dazhynki (). In Belarusian culture it is often associated and intermixed with the feasts of the Assumption of Mary (often dubbed the feast of the Mother of God of the Herbs in both Polish and Belarusian), hence the names of Green Feast () and Dormition () are also used.  History  As with many other Slavic feasts and rites, the origins of Slavic harvest festivals are unclear, in large part due to lack of historical documents from pre-Christian times. It is certain however, that North Slavs (both West and East Slavs) formed mostly agricultural cultures and worshipped deities associated with working the land and passage of seasons. For instance every year at the end of the harvest the West Slavic tribe of Rani would gather around the temple in Arkona. Among the offerings to the god Svetovid was a large, human-sized pancake made of newly threshed grain from that years' harvest. If the pancake was large enough for the priest to hide behind it, the Slavs believed next year's harvest would be equally rich. Apparently a wreath made of the last straws left on the field at the end of the harvest was also believed to possess magical powers.  Common features  Alfred Wierusz- Kowalski. Do≈ºynki. Poland, 1910 The wreath is a central feature of most celebrations associated with do≈ºynki, as it symbolises a rich harvest, the prospect of wealth and the power of new life vested in the grain gathered during the Summer. The latter probably explains why in many regions the grain from the wreath is used as the first batch of grain threshed and set aside for next year's sowing (for instance this practice is common in the Holy Cross Mountains of Central Poland). Originally the wreath was in fact a decorated sheaf of grain, decorated with field flowers, ribbons and braided straws. In fact such wreaths were still being made in Poland in the 1930s. However, with time other forms of wreath became more popular, including the now-typical round wreath, but crown-shaped, oval or rectangular wreaths are also popular in various regions. The sheaf or the wreath is usually brought back into the village by a ceremonial procession. It is often blessed, either by a Christian priest, or in an extra-religious way. For instance in Masovia the wreath is usually brought to the church for the Catholic priest to bless it with holy water. In other regions however it is the priest (Catholic, Orthodox or Greek Catholic) who is brought to the site where the final celebrations take place.  Time frame  Originally the pre-Christian rite was performed on the autumn equinox (23 September). With time the rite became more closely associated with the actual end of fieldwork in the particular region. However, the time between the end of harvest and the festivities varies from area to area. For instance, in the vicinity of Kielce in central Poland and Krak√≥w in southern Poland the wreath was traditionally blessed already on the Feast of the Assumption of Mary (15 August); it was then stored for a night or two in the house of the elder and the manor, before being threshed and the grain immediately sowed in the fields. In Poland In Poland, where the tradition has survived since pre-Christian times, it is known as the largest agricultural holiday and a time for celebrating the hard work of peasantry throughout the whole year. It has been observed after the harvest since the time of the feudal systems of the Middle Ages. While many regional variants of this festival have existed throughout the history of the Polish nation, there were three elements that could be found everywhere: ritual cutting of the last ears of crops, making a wreath and marching with it to the chata cottage house or the dw√≥r manor house, and finally a feast and entertainment with traditional dances. After 1945, do≈ºynki in the Polish People's Republic took on a more political character and were used for propaganda efforts to highlight the strength of the workers' and peasants' alliance, but folk customs remained an integral part of these celebrations; in the 1990s, following the collapse of the Eastern Bloc, authorities restored the more religious meaning of the festival that was present in Interwar Poland while upholding the usual folk traditions. In present-day Poland, a nationwide \\"Presidential Harvest Festival\\" (Do≈ºynki Prezydenckie) has been intermittently observed since its creation in 1927 by president Ignacy Mo≈õcicki in Spa≈Ça. Modern celebrations of do≈ºynki can have a religious or secular character, but they always involve observing traditional customs associated with the end of the harvest season. In the case of a harvest festival of a religious nature, thanks for the crops are usually given to the Christian God and the Mother of God. However, in some parts of Poland it is ethnic Slavic gods who are revered during do≈ºynki; these celebrations are cultivated mostly by neo-pagan religious minorities, referring to the Slavic Native Faith beliefs attributed to the Early Slavs. In Russia It is the ethnolinguistic phenomenon in the history the day of the and the completion of the harvest ritual, falling in many places August 15 (28), in other places celebrated in September. By mid- August harvest grain ends, hence the name of the holiday. Includes the rituals associated with last (dozhinochnym) sheaf, the ritual of \\"curling beard\\" and a celebratory meal. Almost lost in Russia at the Soviet period. In the post- Soviet period this folk tradition in some countries has been recreated as an official holiday.

It was known as Luisenwahl while part of K√∂nigsberg, Germany, until 1945. History Louise with her sons Frederick William and William in Luisenwahl Park. Painting by Carl Steffeck, 1886. Luisenwahl was located in the Mittelhufen and Amalienau quarters of northwestern K√∂nigsberg. The estate Pojenter was located north of the Alter Pillauer Landstra√üe at the end of the 18th century. Aside from the manor house and an avenue of linden trees, the estate also contained forges and homes for day laborers. Schmand and Berliner Weisse were produced at the Milchh√§uschen building, which was dismantled in 1914.Albinus, p. 207 In 1786 Theodor Gottlieb von Hippel the Elder acquired Pojenter, as well as land extending from the Chausseehaus on the Landstra√üe to a footpath which later became Hufen-Allee. A decade later the land was purchased by the school official Gotthilf Christoph Wilhelm Busolt, who renamed the park Louisenwahl to honor his wife, Louise (n√©e Gramatzki). King Frederick William III of Prussia and his wife Louise chose the manor as their summer residence while staying in K√∂nigsberg in 1808-09. In 1829 the manor, since renamed the Luisenhaus, was separated from the rest of the park by construction of a road through Hufen to Lawsken. William I, who had visited the park as a child and again in 1861 during his coronation as King of Prussia, purchased the land in 1872. The Luisendenkmal, a memorial to Queen Louise, was dedicated in 1874 at the highest point of the park; the scenic spot had been favorited by the queen. The K√∂nigin-Luise- Ged√§chtniskirche, now the Kaliningrad Puppet Theatre, was dedicated in the northwestern corner of the park in 1901, the 200th anniversary of the Kingdom of Prussia. Emperor William II granted the park to the city of K√∂nigsberg in 1914. A stele by Walter Rosenberg honoring Franz Schubert was unveiled at a small amphitheatre in the park in 1928. The harsh winter of 1929/30 froze the fruit orchard on the hills of Luisenwahl; children subsequently used it for tobogganing. The park was transferred from Germany to the Soviet Union following World War II in 1945. The Soviet administration expanded it with land from nearby cemeteries and renamed it after Mikhail Kalinin. Now known as Kaliningrad Central Park, it contains monuments of Baron Munchausen and Vladimir Vysotsky, as well some pre-war German architecture. The park administration is located in the building of the former Rominten Hunting Lodge, which was moved from the Rominter Heath to the park.

Haun departing from his family before his execution Christopher Alexander \\"Alex\\" Haun (September 14, 1821 - December 11, 1861) was a potter from Greene County, Tennessee, regarded as one of the most notable and skilled of the antebellum period. During the American Civil War, he was executed by the Confederate States of America for participation in the East Tennessee bridge- burning conspiracy. Haun was one of many examples in 19th century Tennessee of what were later referred to as family potters, rural potters who ran businesses, often part-time as a supplement to farming and with the aid of their families, supplying practical vessels for local use. Stephen T. Rogers of the Tennessee Historical Commission writes that Haun \\"produced some of the most beautiful and finely crafted lead-glazed earthenware in Tennessee\\". Haun and a number of potters lived in a part of Greene County referred to as Pottertown, using local clay found near Lick Creek. Pottertown was a staunchly Unionist enclave in a Confederate State. Union supporter Reverend William Blount Carter launched a plan, with the approval of President Abraham Lincoln, to destroy Tennessee bridges in order to disrupt the Confederate railroad system. Haun and other local potters were recruited to destroy the bridge over Lick Creek. On November 8, 1861, after being sworn into Company F of the 2nd Regiment Tennessee Volunteer Infantry, they proceeded to the bridge and destroyed it. There they captured Confederate sentries and released them after they swore an oath to the union. The Confederate soldiers, however, informed the authorities and Haun and four others were captured. Haun and three of the others were hanged at the Knoxville, Tennessee jail on December 11. Before he died, he wrote to his wife regarding the disposition of his pottery business and concluded: > I have the promise that my body will be sent home to you. O live for heaven, > Oh my bosom friend and children, Live for heaven I pray. My time is almost > out, dear friend, farewell to this world ‚Äî farewell to earth and earthly > troubles.

This phenomenon covers all possible definitions of what feminist movements may entail, as there have been multiple waves of feminist movements and there is no central authority to control what the term \\"feminism\\" claims to be. While one may hold a different opinion from another on the definition of \\"feminism\\", all those who believe in these movements and ideologies share the same goal of dismantling the current patriarchal social structure, where men hold primary power and higher social privileges above all others. Networked feminism is not spearheaded by one singular women's group. Rather, it is the manifestation of feminists' ability to leverage the internet to make traditionally unrepresented voices and viewpoints heard. Networked feminism occurs when social network sites such as Facebook, Twitter and Tumblr are used as a catalyst in the promotion of feminist equality and in response to sexism. Users of these social media websites promote the advancement of feminism using tools such as viral Facebook groups and hashtags. These tools are used to push gender equality and call attention to those promoting anything otherwise. Online feminist work is becoming a new engine of contemporary feminism. With the possibility of connecting and communicating all around the world through the Internet, no other form of activism in history has brought together and empowered so many people to take action on a singular issue. Background The mass convergence of feminists occurred as a result of a spike in the advancement of Internet usage and social media websites. Networked feminism is a part of the contemporary feminist community whose interests revolve around cyberspace, the Internet, and technology. This feminist community makes up the movement known as cyberfeminism. The beginnings of \\"online feminism were primarily in the form of online journals, websites, and blogs, developed in response to the need for a public platform where young women could voice their opinions about the state of the world around them\\". Women and men began creating spaces for themselves to voice out their opinions to create a public awareness of gender and race inequalities. As technology evolved, communication through the internet became more accessible. Nowadays, anyone who has access to the Internet has the capability to voice out their opinions across the globe. Web-based tools and platforms evolved to support the need of communication through the internet like YouTube, which allows for vlogging, or \\"video blogging\\". Social media blogging platforms like Twitter, Tumblr, and Instagram also allow for easier and more immediate sharing capabilities. Facebook is another, considered one of the largest social media platforms of communication, allowing many to use their 'profiles' and opinion dedicated 'groups' to voice their opinions around the world. The creation of these websites have allowed for feminists to take part in social media and other virtual coalitions that combat sexism, making way for networked feminism on a large scale. These coalitions have resulted in increased vocabulary and awareness about gender in the United States' national media dialogue. According to a Score Media Metrix study in 2008, community-based women's websites were one of the fastest growing websites that year. Indeed, \\"the strongest flavor of networked activism today is deeply feminist. There is a tenacious, super-wired coalition of active feminists prepared at a moment‚Äôs notice to blow the lid off sexist attacks or regressive health policy.\\" Feminist blogs have thus provided a much needed service in keeping feminist issues at the forefront of the national and international discussion. Social media has seemingly helped render the present day as an opportune moment for women's activism and women's involvement in national politics. As famous feminist, writer and activist bell hooks notes, \\"Collaborating with diverse thinkers to work toward a greater understanding of the dynamics of race, gender, and class is essential for those of us who want to move beyond one dimensional ways of thinking, being, and living‚Äù. Social media The use of hashtags has become an extremely important factor in the advancement of networked feminism and most all social media activist groups. The use of hashtags provides a means of grouping such messages, since one can search for the hashtag and get the set of messages that contain it. First appearing on the social media platform, Twitter, \\"the platform provides a search function where users can search keywords [or] hashtags.\\" Since the creation of Twitter, the hashtag has spread onto other forms of social media like Facebook, YouTube, Tumblr, and Instagram. Feminist Internet users who participate in the virtual mass convergence of networked feminism use hashtags to form organized Internet groups that share the same hyperlink hashtag. In the case of feminist movements, groups are used to advance an idea or coalition against sexism and the dismantling of the patriarchal system. This activism using tools found on the Internet, particularly the tool of the hashtag, is now called hashtag activism. Social media mega website, Facebook, allows users to interact through friend requests, networks, and groups. A group on Facebook is created to represent anything from a common interest that people share all the way to a coalition that people associate themselves with. In the case of networked feminism, Facebook groups have played an important role in discussing issues and creating bonds against or for a certain topic that revolves around sexism or, on the other hand, the advancement of feminism. Individuals have used these groups, along with other forms of social media and interconnectedness, such as email lists, blogs, YouTube videos, reddit threads, to create forums where feminists can virtually congregate. These forums created an open gateway for the mass virtual convergence that is networked feminism. Examples Through the lightning fast connectivity that is now available through the Internet, communicating ideas like feminist movements has brought about large opportunities to face larger public figures and corporations that hold or have held discriminatory acts against minority groups. More prominent feminist bloggers Vanessa Valenti and Courtney E. Martin have said in their 2012 report Online Revolution that, \\"Contrary to media depictions of online activity as largely narcissistic and/or 'slactivism,' young women across the country‚Äîand all over the world, in fact‚Äîare discovering new ways to leverage the Internet to make fundamental progress in the unfinished revolution of feminism.\\" Body Peace Treaty with Seventeen magazine Fourteen-year-old Julia Bluhm from Waterville, Maine started a protest on Change.org with the petition name \\"Seventeen Magazine: Give Girls Images of Real Girls\\". This protest requested that Seventeen magazine would print one unaltered photo spread per month. Activists, many of whom were teenage girls, demanded that Seventeen magazine stop using Photoshopped and altered images of women and girls, arguing that these images can lead to unrealistic body ideals and subjected many girls to developing extreme dieting, eating disorders, depression and low self-esteem. The online petition created by Bluhm gathered over 80,000 signatures, bolstered by postings on Twitter and Facebook garnered intense media coverage. Protesters as well gathered outside of Seventeen magazine's New York Offices by holding a mock photo shoot to honor what real girls look like. In May 2012, Bluhm, her mother and a group of other teen girls delivered the petition and its 80,000 plus signatures to the Seventeen magazine headquarters in New York City. After the presentation, editor in chief Ann Shoket made the announcement in her editor's letter in the August issue of 2012 that Seventeen magazine had vowed to \\"celebrate every kind of beauty\\" and feature \\"real girls and models who are healthy. Shoket's editor's letter was presented as a \\"Body Peace Treaty\\", promising to \\"never change girl's body or faces shapes\\" when retouching images. This Seventeen magazine protest reached a far greater number of people through the internet, undoubtedly raising the unconsciousness of thousands, most of whom never set foot in New York. Rush Limbaugh's social media defeat Sandra Fluke, a then 30-year-old law student at Georgetown University spoke in front of the House Democratic Steering and Policy Committee regarding the new Administration rules on Conscience Clause exceptions in health care. In her speech, Fluke discussed the reasons that her educational institution, a Catholic university, should offer contraceptives without any co-pay. She then went on to say that 40% of Georgetown Law School's female population suffered financial hardship as a result of birth control not being covered by the student health insurance plan. In response to Flukes' testimony, Limbaugh made some controversial remarks regarding Fluke. On February 29, 2012, Limbaugh was recorded on his talk show calling Sandra Fluke a \\"slut\\" and a \\"prostitute\\" as a result of her speech.Howard, , \\"Forbes\\", 2012 Immediately after Limbaugh's comments went public on his radio show, Limbaugh was criticized by feminists on social media. Internet users created Facebook groups and Twitter hashtags that demanded action be taken against Limbaugh and that he be reprimanded. These Facebook groups and Twitter hashtags directly targeted the barter ads that aired commercials during Limbaugh's radio show. As a result of the massive virtual feminist coalition against Limbaugh, Premiere Networks, the radio group that syndicates the Rush Limbaugh Radio Show, pulled all of its barter ads from the group's affiliated stations from March 12, 2012, through March 23, 2012. Even further, the Internet network created against Limbaugh was so great that it sparked President Obama to express his opinion on Limbaugh's comments, deeming them to be \\"inappropriate\\". After the loss of many of his advertisers, along with the desolation of his reputation via social media, Limbaugh issued an apology to Fluke, stating that he \\"chose the wrong words\\" and he \\"did not mean a personal attack on Ms. Fluke\\". The actions taken against Limbaugh by his advertisers were a direct result of the feminist network that created a coalition against his sexist actions. Mitt Romney and \\"binders full of women\\" On October 16, 2012, Mitt Romney and President Obama participated in the 2nd Presidential debate at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York. An audience member asked the candidates a question regarding inequalities in the workplace. Romney responded by stating, \\"well, gosh, can't we‚Äîcan't we find some‚Äîsome women that are also qualified?' And‚Äîand so we‚Äîwe took a concerted effort to go out and find women who had backgrounds that could be qualified to become members of our cabinet. I went to a number of women's groups and said: 'Can you help us find folks,' and they brought us whole binders full of women.\\" Romney's comment went viral it sparked outrage from feminists in the United States. For instance, a Twitter account was created solely for the purpose of poking fun at Romney and his comments‚Äî\\"@Romneys_Binder\\" and eventually reached up to 13,000 followers. A Facebook group was created with the title \\"Binders Full of Women\\" where Facebook users were able to mock Romney's comments or express their anger and disdain with them. Lastly, the Twitter hashtag \\"#bindersfullofwomen\\" became a trending topic on Twitter and the phrase also was the third-fastest rising search on Google during the televised debate. Furthermore, Internet memes were also created expressing the apparent sexism in Romney's comment. Susan G. Komen and Planned Parenthood In February 2012, the public was notified that breast cancer activist organization Susan G. Komen for the Cure had decided to cut funding to Planned Parenthood. As a result of the organization's decision to cut funding, a networked response was sparked that focused on the war on women's health. In this case, female Internet users, even those who did not identify themselves as feminists, expressed their outrage, again using social media as their main catalyst. Media outlets described this backlash as one of the most organized feminist Internet coalitions in history and called it extra-organizational with their extremely savvy use of social media. Individual women used a variety of Internet channels to connect with other women and create their own protests. Many angry protesters stated that they were cut their funding to the breast cancer organization and donate straight to Planned Parenthood instead. As a result of the overwhelming virtual mass convergence of feminists that came together because of the organization's choice to cut funding to Planned Parenthood, Susan G. Komen reversed their decision and began refunding the non-profit organization. This demonstrated how powerful and hyper-organized networked feminist organizations can be. #NotOkay Movement The #NotOkay movement recently became popularized after Donald Trump's vulgar comment during the presidential debate that took place on October 8, 2016. These comments alluded to a tape from his past that described sexual assaults that he had personally committed and how he treated women. This sparked a chain of tweets featuring the tag #NotOkay, after Canadian Writer, Kelly Oxford prompted many to tweet their own experiences. Oxford's tweet, resulted in millions of responses and became one of the top trending tags within hours. She started off by writing a discrete version of her first experience dealing with sexual assault. Within a day, Oxford tweeted, \\"women have tweeted me sexual assault stories for 14 hours straight. Minimum 50 per minute. Harrowing. Do not ignore. #notokay\\". Among all these accounts a trend transpired, noting that people who held power committed most of these written assaults. Individuals most commonly associated with leadership positions such as pastors, camp counselors, doctors, supervisors, and teachers were allegedly the most common suspects of these sexual harassment cases. Additionally, most of these incidents involved groping, child abuse, and violent rapes at extremely young ages such as seven or eight years old. On another note, this movement was not created as recently as it has been perceived. Originally, the #NotOkay movement was established around November 25, 2014 in Canada. It made its debut alongside the annual Rose Campaign, which was hosted by YWCA Canada. Although the notokay.ca website was put into place, the movement was mainly ignited through social media, specifically using Twitter as its prime platform. Currently located on the notokay.ca page are various tools that individuals can use to bring about awareness for sexual assault such as profile pictures and descriptive and simple banners that can be used on social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter. Towards the bottom of the homepage are also short clips of popular videos, describing examples of sexual assault and harassment.  #MeToo movement  Originally created in 2006, the Me Too movement began to spread virally in October 2017 as a hashtag on social media in an attempt to demonstrate the widespread prevalence of sexual assault and harassment, especially in the workplace. The initial viral breakout began in response to widespread exposure of accusations of predatory behavior by film magnate Harvey Weinstein, but quickly involved others in Hollywood, the music industry, science, academia, and politics, and soon spread to many countries around the world. Networked antifeminism Antifeminism includes beliefs such as hostility towards women's rights,Clatterbaugh, Kenneth (2004), \\"Antifeminism\\", in the belief that the disadvantages suffered by women in society are incorrect or are myths, or that feminism as a movements seeks to harm or oppress men.Clatterbaugh, Kenneth (2007), \\"Anti-feminism\\", in The meaning of antifeminism has varied across time and cultures and continues to vary through different opinions found under this ideology, just as much as the multitude of feminist ideologies. In the 19th century, antifeminism mainly focused on the opposition of the suffrage movement, which battled for the right for women to vote. As well, in the 20th century antifeminists argued whether higher education or entry into the work force was right for women. Both of these views, while seen in the past, are still seen in the present. The rejection of the feminist ideologies sometimes is due to the often misinterpreted ideologies of feminisms. Views from more radical feminists and stereotyped views of feminism, most antifeminists view those who hold feminist ideologies are those who are against men and may group all men into the category of rapists, monsters, and enemies. This view has become so prolific that many women and men now refuse to identify as such due to the negative stigma attached to the word, even if they are feminists or believe in equality across all groups of minorities.Nadeau, Robert L. (1996), \\"The American gender war: sex, gender, and the s/he brain\\", in Nowadays, 21st century antifeminists can be seen focusing on the rejection of all feminist ideologies, with some subscribing to the ideology of humanism rather than feminism. According to the 2002 Amsterdam Declaration of the World Humanist Congress, humanism, \\"affirms the worth, dignity, and autonomy of the individual\\" against religious and political dogmas. However, humanism's foundations were first created in the Age of Enlightenment of the 18th century, A cultural and intellectual movement of the Renaissance that emphasized human potential to attain excellence and promoted direct study of the literature, art, and civilization of classical Greece and Rome. Judith Butler explains that humanism \\"supposes that there is one single idea of what it is to be human\\". Therefore, humanism turns away from difference and diversity and does not create opportunities for all social groups to be considered equal. The first wave of feminism is thought to mainly belong to the suffragettes who were women and men political activists who fought for the right for women to vote who were active mainly in the 19th century.Shukla, Bhasker A. (2006), \\"Feminist movement - an introduction\\", in Antifeminists commonly believe that this movement that was started by the suffragettes was only necessary in the 1920s, and now most antifeminists believe that this movement is no longer needed today and is a thing of the past. Most antifeminists also believe that the wage gap between men and women is a made- up myth to support a no longer necessary and outdated movement and is only now current as a movement oppositional to the male sex. With the continual growth of misconceptions behind the goals of feminist movements, the connectivity of the Internet and social media platforms are commonly used as debate grounds over the truths or falsities behind this often misinterpreted ideology. There is currently a plethora of websites that discuss the topic of antifeminism, using the hashtag of the famous social media campaign Women Against Feminism. On social media platforms like YouTube and Tumblr, numerous male and female users explain in their videos why they are against feminism. Women and men also post pictures of themselves, or selfies, holding messages like \\"I don't need feminism because...\\" Their arguments of why they may not need feminism can range. Some messages may read \\"I don't need feminism because I love my boyfriend and we both respect each other\\"; \\"I don't need feminism because I want to promise my man to love him, honor him and obey him\\"; or \\"I don't need feminism because I have the same equal rights as men\\". Feminist debates and internal issues While the Internet and social media platforms are used to branch out and communicate ideas to others around the globe, the Internet is a place of no secrecy and anyone who has access to the Internet can view and comment on someone's posted opinions and beliefs. While there is a current heated debate on the definitions that pertain to the feminist movements, most debates found on articles, blog sites, and social media accounts can be seen from other feminists, attacking others when not all information of the movement is available or acknowledged in posts online. Much toxicity and discourse can be seen coming from the sometimes \\"slashing righteousness of more radical feminists\\". Many bloggers and tweeters fear of publishing statuses and articles that address feminism as it is an ideological land mine that can trigger anyone that can glance at their work from their desktops at home to possibly lash out. Katherine Cross, a Puerto Rican transgender woman has written that she \\"fears being cast suddenly as one of the 'bad guys' for being insufficiently radical, too nuanced or too forgiving, or for simply writing whose offensive dimensions would be unknown to me at the time of publication\\". While it is important to point out misogyny and other forms of discrimination in the realm of the Internet, facing and educating those who may not understand that some of their actions are offensive, it is also important to give others respect and acknowledge others education or lack of. While the internet is a great place for communication, \\"Online harassment and threats are a daily experience for online activists, and young women and girls are increasingly bombarded with vitriolic and harmful messaging on the very same forums we use for activism\\". Criticism Rebecca Sive of The Sive Group, Inc in Chicago indicated in a May 2012 article on Reproductive Health Reality Check's website that she believes \\"new networked feminism is just like the old networked feminism\\", because both its method and measures of success are the same. Sive states that \\"in order to achieve institutional change, women have always talked, networked, and connected to get organized\\", but the medium is just different with new networked feminism. Sive seemingly implies that widespread feminist movements occur when women collectively decide institutional change is necessary, and then use the most appropriate and effective mediums to achieve this change. Thus, mediums do not inspire change, they just help facilitate it. Additionally, although social media has helped raise awareness about feminism and women's issues, \\"there's still the concern of creating an echo chamber\\", says Nona Willis-Aronowitz, author of Girl Drive: Criss-crossing America, Redefining Feminism. Arnowitz states that there is incredible diversity among women and men about what exactly feminism means, making it harder to classify what does and does not constitute new networked feminism. Digital divide Networked feminism's impact is somewhat limited because not everyone has access to the internet. According to Samhita Mukhopadhyay, the executive editor of Feministing, a popular feminist blog, \\"we tend to forget the women who aren't online ‚Äì there is a digital divide ‚Äì and I think that part of the feminist movement should be focused on reaching out to people face-to-face doing community work, doing international work. A lot of people are online but not everybody, not by a long shot.\\" See also * Internet activism, slacktivism * FemTechNet References Category:Feminist movements and ideologies ","title":"Networked feminism"},{"id":"37968299","text":"Mazraeh Now (, also Romanized as Mazra‚Äòeh Now and Mazra‚Äòeh-ye Now; also known as MarzƒÅno) is a village in Mazraeh Now Rural District, in the Central District of Ashtian County, Markazi Province, Iran.

Screenwriter Sally Wainwright loosely adapted the story of her mother's second marriage. The series stars Derek Jacobi and Anne Reid as Alan and Celia. The series has been praised for its depiction of the older generation, strong acting, and believable dialogue. A critic for The Daily Telegraph summarised the series as \\"a triumph against TV's ageism\\", and it has been endorsed by an executive member of the charity Age UK. Ahead of the American premiere, Los Angeles Times critic Mary McNamara described it as \\"the best new show of the fall\\". Last Tango in Halifax accrued four nominations for the 2013 British Academy Television Awards and won the British Academy Television Award for Best Drama Series. Overview Celia Dawson and Alan Buttershaw are both widowed and in their seventies. They were attracted to each other in the 1950s, but never expressed their feelings, and Celia moved away with her parents. In the present day, they are reunited after being persuaded to join Facebook by their respective grandchildren. Alan has loved Celia since he was 16 years old, whilst Celia is described as a woman who is \\"unfulfilled\\" and was unhappily married to a man she grew to hate. After their reunion, Alan and Celia discover that they still feel as passionately for each other as they did when they were teenagers. Their story is described as a \\"testament of the uplifting power of love at any age\\". Alan and Celia's romance is depicted alongside the troubles of their own grown-up daughters, and the series' official description says that its portrayal of family is \\"as dark as it is comic\\". Alan's daughter Gillian and Celia's daughter Caroline are complete opposites: widowed Gillian runs a farm and works part-time in a supermarket, whilst Oxford-educated Caroline is the principal of an exclusive independent school. Their parents' engagement affects both daughters' lives. Gillian wonders how she and her son will cope without her father around to help, whilst Caroline, struggling with depression and her feelings for a female colleague, feels that her mother's unconventional romance gives her \\"permission to finally admit to being who she really is\\". Production Concept and writing The series is based on lead writer Sally Wainwright's personal experiences. She described it as \\"the most personal thing I've ever written\\". Her mother, Dorothy, lost contact with a childhood friend, Alec Walker, when she was 15, but they reconnected on the social networking website Friends Reunited 60 years later and within six months were married. When she told the story to her colleague Nicola Shindler, Shindler suggested she turn her experience into a television series. Shindler became the series' executive producer. Through Caroline, the series explores various LGBT themes. A source of contention for Celia is her daughter entering into a same sex relationship and later coming out to her. Anne Reid spoke positively of the storyline, stating that she believes a lot of people of her own generation are homophobic. She felt that her own character \\"might show them [and] might change them\\" just as Celia must become more accepting to avoid losing Alan. Jacobi concurred: Alan has \\"a streak of tolerance in him ... that perhaps Celia doesn't\\". In series three, the division between Celia and Caroline widens after Celia refuses to attend Caroline's wedding to another woman. Wainwright felt that killing off Caroline's partner Kate would be the most effective way to propel the drama onwards and to develop the emotional lives of the remaining characters going forward. She was conflicted over this decision, having grown attached to the character of Kate, and actress Nina Sosanya, and wrote two versions of the fourth episode; the unaired one would have seen Kate survive. Characters and casting Derek Jacobi is renowned for his theatre work. Discussing the casting of Derek Jacobi and Anne Reid, Wainwright stated: \\"we went for the best and we got them\\". The Guardian felt that one of the series' successes was the unlikely casting of a \\"theatrical knight\\" (Jacobi) and a \\"TV Stalwart\\" (Reid). Jacobi was surprised to be offered the role of Alan; as his reputation centred on parts that were either \\"posh\\", \\"classical\\" or \\"costume\\". He enjoyed having the chance to play someone who is \\"an ordinary fellow\\". He also felt the series provided a chance to depict a \\"love story between two older characters that isn't patronising or stereotyped in any way\\". Reid and Jacobi also influenced the creative process ‚Äî after Reid discovered Jacobi could jive, they implored Wainright to include a dance scene in an episode. Jacobi also inspired a scene in which two of Alan's friends (played by Roy Barraclough and Paul Copley) vie to be his best man. A teenage version of Alan is portrayed in flashback by Nico Mirallegro. Reid was Wainwright's personal choice for the role of Celia. Reid hoped that Last Tango in Halifax would \\"give hope to older people\\". Reid identified herself with Celia's personality ‚Äì believing herself to be quite reckless and outgoing ‚Äì though stated that unlike her character she has no desire to enter another relationship. Reid described filming the series as \\"one of the best times in my career\\" and stated that she was proud of the work put in. Amelia Young plays a teenage Celia during a flashback sequence in episode six. Caroline, whose lesbian relationship forms a prominent subplot. Lancashire discerned that the series was \\"very special\\" within reading two pages of the script. Other factors that persuaded her to commit to the series included the casting of Reid and Jacobi, and the series' juxtaposition of a heart-warming story with elements of humour. In terms of her character, Lancashire identified with Caroline being \\"a working woman trying to keep everything under control\\". She stated the series' ensemble cast was \\"the closest I‚Äôve come to being in a theatre company on television\\" due to how well the actors worked together. The cast had all assumed that Last Tango in Halifax would only run for one series. Filming of the second series clashed with filming of the second series of the BBC One period drama The Paradise, which also starred Sarah Lancashire. This necessitated her having to leave her role in The Paradise halfway through the second series in order to reprise her role as Caroline in Last Tango in Halifax. In an interview in 2013 Lancashire stated that the decision to return to Last Tango in Halifax was the easiest she had made in her working life stating \\"as an actor you can wait an entire career to be involved in a project like this.\\" The role resulted in her receiving the most fan mail of her career. Lancashire was surprised and humbled by the responses from women stating that Caroline's same sex relationship had personally inspired them. She stated that in her approach to the character she did not focus on Caroline's sexuality, but the \\"humanity of her\\". Due to the underrepresentation of gay characters on television, Lancashire felt it particularly important that Caroline's experience would not be portrayed inaccurately. In 2014 Wainwright recalled being \\"blown away\\" by Lancashire's performances in the rushes for the series, which partly inspired her to script the series Happy Valley in which Lancashire plays the lead role. Nicola Walker completes the main cast as Gillian. She admired the character's honesty, bravery and lack of self-pity, and identified strongly with her tendency to speak before thinking things through and her deep love for her father. In 2014 The Daily Telegraph described the role as a \\"game-changer\\" in the trajectory of Walker's career. Though ultimately successful in winning the role Walker initially believed that she would not get the part due to a lack of confidence in her northern accent, and the presence of northern actresses in the audition. Her approach to the character saw her delve into Gillian's psychology, with Walker particularly interested in the contradiction between Gillian's sexual confidence and her use of sex as a form of self-punishment. She felt the series showed a very adult approach to storytelling, stating that she had \\"never come across a character like Gillian before\\" and praising the variety of strong female roles. The Independent noted the significance of the series having three female leads over the age of 40, stating that this, alongside Caroline's lesbian storyline and Gillian's attitude towards sex made the series \\"quietly subversive\\" when compared against primetime television as a whole. In addition to its main characters, Last Tango in Halifax features a regular supporting cast. Nina Sosanya plays Caroline's romantic partner Kate, whom she decides to marry over the course of the series. Gerard Gilbert of The Independent describes the relationship between the couple as \\"one of the most normalised lesbian relationships ever shown on the small screen.\\" Nina Sosanya noted that she enjoyed filming with Sarah Lancashire and that the pair would \\"giggle a lot like completely juvenile idiots\\" whilst filming their love scenes. Other characters introduced in the first series include Caroline's husband John (Tony Gardner) and his lover Judith (Ronni Ancona), Gillian's brother-in-law, Robbie (Dean Andrews), and Paul (Sacha Dhawan), a youth with whom Gillian has a sexual relationship. Josh Bolt plays Gillian's son Raff, whilst Edward Ashley and Louis Greatorex play Caroline's teenage sons William and Lawrence. The second series expanded the families of Alan and Celia. Timothy West appears as Alan's brother Ted whilst Gemma Jones plays Celia's sister Muriel. The third series later introduces Rupert Graves as Gary, who is revealed to be Alan's illegitimate son, and Michelle Hurst as Kate's mother Ginika. Filming The first series was filmed in Yorkshire and in Altrincham between January and April 2012. Altrincham was used to represent scenes set in Harrogate, such as those set at Caroline's house. The second series began filming in July 2013. Filming took place at Holdsworth House in Halifax in August 2013 and also at Hoghton Tower, a fortified manor house in Lancashire, in August 2013. This resulted in the Tower's being closed to the public between 19 and 28 August. In September the University of York supplied ten students from the Department of Theatre, Film and Television to work as extras on the series. Filming for the third series began in Yorkshire and at Peover Hall, near Knutsford, Cheshire in July 2014. In November 2017, explaining why the series had no starting date for filming its next series, a BBC spokesperson said ‚ÄúSally [Wainwright] is presently engaged with another BBC project, but has every intention of revisiting Last Tango when she is able to.‚Äù Wainwright's new period drama series, Gentleman Jack, was scheduled to air on BBC One in 2018, and she was also working on a third series of Happy Valley. Episodes Broadcast audiences Consolidated viewing figures The series premi√®red to overnight ratings of 6.160 million viewers, 25.6% of the available audience, as the highest rated show at 9 pm on 20 November. The first series' finale, airing 19 December 2012, also won its time-slot, achieving an overnight series high of 6.290 million viewers, 26.6% of the available audience. Consolidated figures released by the Broadcasters' Audience Research Board (BARB) revealed that the series premi√®re achieved a consolidated rating of 7.304 million viewers, whilst the finale had 7.480 million. The overall series average in terms of viewing figures was 7.316 million viewers. The Independent reported that the early consolidated ratings received by the programme made it the highest rated new mid-week television drama of 2012. In September 2013, the series began airing on the American broadcast television network PBS. Critical reception Rotten Tomatoes critic ratings are 94% for Series 1 and 100% for Series 2 and 3.https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/last_tango_in_halifax The series has attracted mostly positive reviews, largely focused on the depiction of its two septuagenarian lead characters. Jane Shilling of The Daily Telegraph labelled the series \\"a triumph against TV's ageism\\" in an examination of the portrayal of elderly people in the media. Shilling singled out Jacobi and Reid's performances, stating that they provide a \\"mixture of gravity and levity\\" that \\"brings a transcendent quality to their characters' resolute ordinariness\\". Lucy Harmer, an executive member of the charity Age UK, also praised the series for portraying two \\"normal, healthy and sane\\" older characters, citing the depiction of Internet use by the elderly as something ordinary. She compared the treatment of older characters in the series to Hilary Boyd's novel Thursdays in the Park and the film The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel (2012). The Huffington Posts Caroline Frost thought the series was reminiscent of the dialogue and sensibility of the playwright Alan Bennett. She wrote the story was poignant and praised a central theme underlining \\"how many people make do with their day-to-day business and responsibilities, while still holding on to their private dreams\\". Andrew Anthony of The Guardian had his \\"low expectations ... squarely confounded\\", giving particular praise to the dialogue and the central performances. Jane Simon of the Daily Mirror felt that Last Tango in Halifax experienced a mid-series dip, though she praised what she felt was a triumphant finale. She also praised Wainwright's script and the lead quartet of Jacobi, Reid, Lancashire, and Walker for creating \\"characters you can believe in even when they're behaving appallingly\\". The series was reviewed favourably by the American website AfterEllen, which reports on the depiction of gay and bisexual women in the media. Correspondent Jill Guccini stated that she \\"started off watching this series thinking it was a cute little show about some oldies falling in love\\", but at the end of the series believed it was \\"some of the finest television I've seen, anywhere, ever\\". Critical reception in the United States was also largely positive following PBS' acquisition of the show. Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times labelled the series as \\"the best new show of the fall\\", describing it as \\"a rapturous mix of absurdly fairy-tale-romance and frantic modern complications, set in the picturesque drear of Yorkshire and brought to life by masterfully shaded performances.\\" She opined that Reid and Jacobi \\"are capable of doing more with a startled look or careful smile ... than most actors can do in seven pages of dialogue\\". Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe acknowledged that the US public might not find the series appealing based on its title and premise alone, stating that PBS' description of the programme made it sound \\"as saccharine and hackneyed as a Geritol commercial\\". Upon viewing the series, however, he praised the added dimensions of the series and wrote that it was \\"so much more interesting\\" than the central premise suggested. He also felt that Walker and Lancashire played an important part, \\"both add[ing] a necessary amount of bitter to the sweet\\". Mike Hale of The New York Times was more cynical about the series, describing it as a \\"warm comforter of a series\\" and \\"treacle\\". However, he felt that series also distinguished itself from this category of media by its \\"relatively dry style and careful modulation of tone and volume\\" in addition to \\"a crackerjack cast\\". However, while reception of the series itself in the United States has been generally favourable, PBS has come under some criticism for its choice to broadcast edited versions of several episodes (often involving several minutes of deletions) for reasons of both length and content. Accolades The first series of Last Tango in Halifax was nominated for four awards at the 2013 British Academy Television Awards, which took place on 12 May 2013. Actors Derek Jacobi, Anne Reid, and Sarah Lancashire earned respective nominations in the Best Actor, Best Actress, and Best Supporting Actress categories. The series itself was nominated for the British Academy Television Award for Best Drama Series, and ultimately won. Additionally, Wainwright was named best Drama Writer at the 2013 British Academy Television Craft Awards for her writing of the series. The series was nominated for Best Drama Series at the 2013 Broadcasting Press Guild Awards whilst Sally Wainwright was nominated for the writer's award for her contribution to both Last Tango in Halifax and Scott & Bailey. In 2014, Sarah Lancashire and Nicola Walker were both nominated for a British Academy Television Award in the category for \\"Best Supporting Actress\\" for their roles in Last Tango in Halifax. Lancashire won the award for her role as Caroline. Possible adaptations In October 2013, it was reported in news outlets that American actress, screenwriter, and producer Diane Keaton had acquired the rights to remake Last Tango in Halifax for American audiences on the subscription cable channel HBO. Sally Wainwright mentioned this development at a Broadcasting Press Guild event and stated that though she did not expect to be closely involved in the remake, she would have an associate producer role. However, the following day Red Production Company released a statement stating that a remake would likely be delayed since the original series was still airing on American channel PBS. In April 2014, it was reported that the series would be remade for French television by BBC Worldwide France and the production company NEWEN.

Siebert. The Neo-Romanesque building was designed by the architects Friedrich Heitmann and Franz Krah to serve the residential suburbs of Amalienau, Mittelhufen, and Vorderhufen. Constructed in Amalienau between 1899 and 1901 and dedicated on 9 September 1901, the church was heavily damaged during World War II. K√∂nigsberg became the Soviet city of Kaliningrad after the war, and the Soviet authorities planned to demolish the ruins in the 1960s. However, the architect Yuri Vaganov convinced officials that the building could be converted into a puppet theatre. Renovations were completed in 1976. While the exterior of the building has largely retained its pre-war appearance, the interior has been redesigned to fit the needs of a theatre.

Academic career Brown began his teaching career at Princeton in 1965. In 1971, he received the Arthur Kingsley Porter Prize of the College Art Association of America and was promoted to associate professor. Two years later, he became the director of the Institute of Fine Arts (IFA), New York University's graduate program in art history. He was appointed professor in 1977. At the IFA, Brown promoted the study of Spanish art, a relatively neglected field in the American academy. During the last decade, he has expanded his interests to viceregal Latin American art, particularly the painting of New Spain.Brown, Jonathan (2014). In the Shadow of Vel√°zquez: A Life in Art History (New Haven: Yale University Press). Curating Brown has curated and co-curated several pioneering exhibitions throughout his career. While a faculty member at Princeton, he organized \\"Jusepe de Ribera: Prints and Drawings\\" at the university's museum, which featured several Spanish drawings from its collection. He has continued to organize shows focusing on Spanish drawings, including 1976's Murillo & His Drawings, also held at the Princeton University Art Museum, and \\"The Spanish Manner: Drawings from Ribera to Goya,\\" held at The Frick Collection in 2010. Brown has had a long association with The Frick Collection, co-curating several shows at the institution, including \\"Goya's Last Works\\" of 2006. In his review of the exhibition, Andrew Schulz commented that: \\"Brown and [his co-curator Susan Grace] Galassi did a marvelous job of assembling works from public and private collections in North America and Spain that covered the full range of [Goya‚Äôs] late production: portraits in oil, ivory miniatures, black crayon drawings, and lithographs.\\" Schulz concludes: \\"Their landmark exhibition and catalogue will provide the point of departure as we continue to gain insights into the last works of this singular artist.\\"Schulz, Andrew (2006). \\"Jonathan Brown and Susan Grace Galassi Goya's Last Works (Review).\\" caa.reviews (November 14, 2006).

Jackson, eds., 2011. Glossary of Geology (5th ed.). Alexandria, Virginia, American Geological Institute. 800 pp. Although somewhat related to a pothole in origin, a plunge pool (or plunge basin or waterfall lake) is the deep depression in a stream bed at the base of a waterfall. it is created by the erosional forces of turbulence generated by water falling on rocks at a waterfall's base where the water impacts.Marshak, Stephen, 2009. Essentials of Geology, W. W. Norton & Company, 3rd ed. Potholes are also sometimes referred to as swirlholes. This word was created to avoid confusion with an English term for a vertical or steeply inclined karstic shaft in limestone. However, given widespread usage of this term for a type of fluvial sculpted bedrock landform, pothole is preferred in usage to swirlhole.Richardson, K. and Carling, P., 2005. A typology of sculpted forms in open bedrock channels. Special Paper 392. Boulder, Colorado: Geological Society of America. 108 pp. Canajoharie The term pothole is also used to refer to other types of depressions and basins that differ in origin.

In another case, the term pothole is used to refer to a shallow depression, generally less than in area that occurs between dunes or on subdued morainic relief on a prairie, as in Minnesota and the Dakotas, and often contains an intermittent pond or marsh that serves as a nesting place for waterfowl. Origin The consensus of geomorphologists and sedimentologists is that fluvial potholes are created by the grinding action of either a stone or stones or coarse sediment (sand, gravel, pebbles, boulders), whirled around and kept in motion by eddies within and force of the stream current in a given spot. Being a spectacular feature of bedrock river channels, they have been and still are studied extensively and considered as a key factor in bedrock channel development and morphology and important factor in the incision of bedrock channels.Das, B.C., 2018.

Music career Born in Harlem, New York as Russell Linwood Thomas, Abdul Al-Khabyyr lived most of his life in Montreal, Quebec. He became a naturalized Canadian in 1965 and converted to Islam in 1971. In his teens he studied clarinet and saxophone in New York City with Cecil Scott and others. In 1954 he traveled to Montreal with trombonist Snub Mosley to play in various nightclubs. While there he met his future wife and decided to stay, working with Al Cowans (19541955) and then leading his own band (19551957). In Ottawa from 1957 to 1970, he was a member at various times of the Canadian Jazz Quartet (with Richard Wyands on piano, Wyatt Ruther on bass, and Doug Johnston on drums), the Ottawa Saxophone Quartet and also studio/dance bands led by Champ Champagne, Buster Monroe and others. He led his own orchestra at the Gatineau Country Club from 1959 to 1965, except for a short break in 1963 as he recovered from a bout with Polio. He also appeared regularly on CBC programming as a guest or backing musician. Trio 3 consisting of Sayyd Abdul Al-Khabyyr, Pauline Vaillancourt and left From 1970 to 1980 he returned to Montreal as a teacher in the Jazz Music department of the Universit√© de Montr√©al.

Personal life Married in 1955 (jazz great Charlie Biddle served as best man), Abdul Al-Khabyyr and his wife had five children. Although all play musical instruments masterfully, two of his children, drummer Nasyr and trombonist Muhammad, followed in his footsteps and both became professional musicians and music teachers. Also notable, Abdul Al-Khabyyr is the father-in- law of Grammy Award-winning jazz musician Kenny Garrett. In 1971, after reading the biography of Malcolm X, Abdul Al-Khabyyr and his family converted to Islam and he went on to become an Imam. Through their common faith Abdul Al-Khabyyr developed a friendship with boxing great Muhammad Ali, who would stay in his town of Mount Royal home when visiting the area. In the late 1990s he moved back to Montreal and, after suffering strokes in 2001 and 2004, no longer performed.

Defensive gun use (DGU) is the use or presentation of a firearm for self-defense, defense of others or in some cases, protecting property. The frequency of incidents involving DGU, and their effectiveness in providing safety and reducing crime is a controversial issue in gun politics and criminology, chiefly in the United States.Harry L. Wilson, Guns, Gun Control, And Elections: The Politics And Policy of Firearms, , Rowman & Littlefield, 2007. Different authors and studies employ different criteria for what constitutes a defensive gun use which leads to controversy in comparing statistical results. Perceptions of defensive gun use are recurring themes in discussions over gun rights, gun control, armed police, open and concealed carry of firearms. Estimates of frequency Estimates over the number of defensive gun uses vary wildly, depending on the study's definition of a defensive gun use, survey design, country, population, criteria, time-period studied, and other factors. Low-end estimates are in the range of 55,000 to 80,000 incidents per year, while high end estimates reach 4.7 million per year. Discussion over the number and nature of DGU and the implications to gun control policy came to a head in the late 1990s.Otis Dudley Duncan, \\"Gun Use Surveys: In Numbers We Trust?\\", Criminologist, v25 n1, Jan/Feb 2000. Estimates of DGU from the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) are consistently lower than those from other studies. A 2000 study suggested that this may be because the NCVS measures different activities than the other surveys do. The National Self-Defense Survey and the NCVS, vary in their methods, time-frames covered, and questions asked.Committee on Law and Justice, Firearms and Violence: A Critical Review (2004) , page 103. DGU questions were asked of all the NSDS sample. Due to screening questions in the NCVS survey, only a minority of the NCVS sample were asked a DGU question.Philip J. Cook and Jens Ludwig, \\"Guns in America: National Survey on Private Ownership and Use of Firearms\\", NIJ Research in Brief, May 1997. Lower-end estimates include that by David Hemenway, a professor of Health Policy at the Harvard School of Public Health, which estimated approximately 55,000‚Äì80,000 such uses each year.David Hemenway, Chance, Vol 10, No. 3, 1997.Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology (Northwestern) 87 (1997): 1430. Another survey including DGU questions was the National Survey on Private Ownership and Use of Firearms, NSPOF, conducted in 1994 by the Chiltons polling firm for the Police Foundation on a research grant from the National Institute of Justice. in 1997 NSPOF projected 4.7 million DGU per year by 1.5 million individuals after weighting to eliminate false positives. Another estimate has estimated approximately 1 million DGU incidents in the United States. Kleck and Gertz, and Cook and Ludwig A commonly cited 1995 study by Kleck and Gertz estimated that between 2.1 and 2.5 million DGUs occur in the United States each year.J.N. Schulman, Guns, Crimes and Self-defense, Orange County Reg., Sept. 19, 1993, at 3. After Kleck and Gertz accounted for telescoping, their estimate was reduced to 2.1 million DGU per year. Kleck and Gertz conducted this survey in 1992, and Kleck began publicizing the 2.5 million DGU per year estimate in 1993. By 1997, the 2.5 million per year number from Kleck & Gertz' study had been cited as fact by news articles, editorial writers, and the Congressional Research Service. Besides the NSDS and NCVS surveys, ten national and three state surveys summarized by Kleck and Gertz gave 764 thousand to 3.6 million DGU per year. In the report \\"Guns in America: National Survey on Private Ownership and Use of Firearms\\" by Philip J. Cook and Jens Ludwig, projected 4.7 million DGU which Cook and Ludwig explained by pointing out all of the NSPOF sample were asked the DGU question. Cook and Ludwig also compared the U.S. crime rate to the number of DGU reported by Kleck and similar studies and said that their estimate of DGU is improbably high. Both Kleck and Gertz' and Lott's research are highly controversial within the academic community. Hemenway has asserted that Kleck and Gertz' methodology suffers from several biases leading them to overestimate the number of DGU, including telescoping, the social desirability bias, and the possibility that \\"some gun advocates will lie to help bias estimates upwards.\\" Hemenway contends the Kleck and Gertz study is unreliable and no conclusions can be drawn from it. He argues that there are too many \\"false positives\\" in the surveys, and finds the NCVS figures more reliable, yielding estimates of around 100,000 defensive gun uses per year. Applying different adjustments, other social scientists suggest that between 250,000 and 370,000 incidents per year. In 1996, Cook and Ludwig reported that based on their analysis of the National Survey of Private Ownership of Firearms, which \\"incorporated a sequence of DGU questions very similar to that used by Kleck and Gertz,\\" they estimated that 4.7 million defensive gun uses occur in the United States per year. However, they questioned whether this estimate was credible because the same survey suggests that approximately 132,000 perpetrators were either wounded or killed at the hands of armed civilians in 1994. They note that this number is about the same as the number of people hospitalized for gunshot injuries that year, but that \\"almost all of those are there as a result of criminal assault, suicide attempt, or accident.\\" Kleck asserts errors in his critics' statements that his survey's estimates of defensive gun uses linked with specific crime types, or that involved a wounding of the offender, are implausibly large compared to estimates of the total numbers of such crimes. The total number of nonfatal gunshot woundings, whether medically treated or not, is unknown, and no meaningful estimates can be derived from his survey regarding defensive gun uses linked with specific crime types, or that involved wounding the offender, because the sample sizes are too small. The fact that some crime-specific estimates derived from the Kleck survey are implausibly large is at least partly a reflection of the small samples on which they are based - no more than 196 cases. Kleck states that his estimate of total defensive gun uses was based on nearly 5,000 cases. Thus, he argues, the implausible character of some estimates of small subsets of defensive gun uses is not a valid criticism of whether estimates of the total number of defensive gun uses are implausible or too high.Kleck, G. and D. Kates (2001), Armed: New Perspectives on Gun Control, Chapter 6. N.Y.: Prometheus Marvin Wolfgang, who was acknowledged in 1994 by the British Journal of Criminology as ‚Ä≥the most influential criminologist in the English- speaking world‚Ä≥, commented on Kleck's research concerning defensive gun use: \\"I am as strong a gun-control advocate as can be found among the criminologists in this country. [...] The Kleck and Gertz study impresses me for the caution the authors exercise and the elaborate nuances they examine methodologically. I do not like their conclusions that having a gun can be useful, but I cannot fault their methodology. They have tried earnestly to meet all objections in advance and have done exceedingly well.\\"Marvin E. Wolfgang, A Tribute to a View I Have Opposed, 86 J. Crim. L. & Criminology 188 (1995-1996) http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6854&context;=jclc A 1998 study by Philip Cook and Jens Ludwig replicated the Kleck and Gertz survey, but also concluded that the results of these surveys were far too high. A similar conclusion was reached by a 2018 RAND Corporation report, which stated that the Kleck-Gertz estimate of 2.5 million DGUs per year, and other similar estimates, \\"are not plausible given other information that is more trustworthy, such as the total number of U.S. residents who are injured or killed by guns each year.\\" The same report also stated that \\"At the other extreme, the NCVS estimate of 116,000 DGU incidents per year almost certainly underestimates the true number,\\" concluding that \\"... there is still considerable uncertainty about the prevalence of DGU\\". National Crime Victimization Survey A 1994 study examined NCVS data and concluded that between 1987 and 1990, there were approximately 258,460 incidents in which firearms were used defensively in the United States, for an annual average of 64,615. The same study said that \\"Firearm self-defense is rare compared with gun crimes.\\" An article published by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, drawing its DGU from the NCVS, said: \\"In 1992 offenders armed with handguns committed a record 931,000 violent crimes ... On average in 1987-92 about 83,000 crime victims per year used a firearm to defend themselves or their property. Three- fourths of the victims who used a firearm for defense did so during a violent crime; a fourth, during a theft, household burglary, or motor vehicle theft.\\" A 2013 study, also released by the BJS, found that less than 1% of nonfatal violent crime victims during the 2007-2011 period reported using a gun to defend themselves. The same study reported that \\"The percentage of nonfatal violent victimizations involving firearm use in self defense remained stable at under 2% from 1993 to 2011.\\", reporting 235,700 instances of defensive use of a firearm between 2007-2011 Cook and Ludwig said of the NCVS, NSPOF, and Kleck surveys: \\"The key explanation for the difference between the 108,000 NCVS estimate for the annual number of defensive gun uses and the several million from the surveys discussed earlier is that NCVS avoids the false- positive problem by limiting defensive gun use questions to persons who first reported that they were crime victims. Most NCVS respondents never have a chance to answer the defensive gun use question, falsely or otherwise.\\" Clayton Cramer and David Barnett say that such a structure could cause the NCVS to under-count defensive gun uses, because someone who has successfully defended themselves with a gun may not consider themselves a \\"victim of a crime.\\" In the NCVS, if one says that they have not been a victim of a crime, the survey assumes that there was no attempted crime and does not go on to ask if they have used a gun in self-defense.Clayton Cramer and David Barnett, \\"Tough Targets: When Criminals Face Resistance From Citizens\\" CATO Institute, 2012, p.8 According to Jens Ludwig, estimates of the frequency of DGU from the NCVS appear to be too low, but those from phone surveys (like that conducted by Kleck and Gertz) appear to be too high. Lott research John Lott, an economist and guns rights advocate, argues in both More Guns, Less Crime and The Bias Against Guns that media coverage of defensive gun use is rare, noting that in general, only shootings ending in fatalities are discussed in news stories. In More Guns, Less Crime, Lott writes that \\"[s]ince in many defensive cases a handgun is simply brandished, and no one is harmed, many defensive uses are never even reported to the police\\". Attempting to quantify this phenomenon, in the first edition of the book, published in May 1998, Lott wrote that \\"national surveys\\" suggested that \\"98 percent of the time that people use guns defensively, they merely have to brandish a weapon to break off an attack.\\" The higher the rate of defensive gun uses that do not end in the attacker being killed or wounded, the easier it is to explain why defensive gun uses are not covered by the media without reference to media bias. Lott cited the figure frequently in the media, including publications like the Wall Street Journal and the Los Angeles Times. In 2002, he repeated the survey, and reported that brandishing a weapon was sufficient to stop an attack 95% of the time. Other researchers criticized his methodology, saying that his sample size of 1,015 respondents was too small for the study to be accurate and that the majority of similar studies suggest a value between 70 and 80 percent brandishment-only. Lott explained the lower brandishment-only rates found by others was at least in part due to the different questions that were asked.Discussion of different surveys on defensive gun use. Most surveys used a recall period of \\"Ever\\" while some (Hart, Mauser, and Tarrance) used the previous five years. The Field Institute survey used periods of previous year, previous two years and ever. The NSPOF survey used a one-year recall period. Lott also used a one-year recall period and asked respondents about personal experiences only, due to questionable respondent recall of events past one year and respondent knowledge of DGU experiences of other household members. Hemenway research In 2000, Hemenway published a survey which found that \\"Guns are used to threaten and intimidate far more often than they are used in self defense\\"; also that year, he published another survey which found that \\"criminal gun use is far more common than self-defense gun use.\\" Both of these surveys argued that many defensive gun uses may not be in the best interests of society. Also in 2000, Hemenway and his colleagues conducted a small survey that found that guns in the home were used more often to intimidate family members (13 respondents) than in self-defense (2 respondents). The same study stated that its results suggested that most self- defense gun uses did not occur in the home, and that non-gun weapons are used more often to thwart crime than guns are. A later survey by Hemenway et al. that included 5,800 California adolescents found that about 0.3% of these adolescents reported having used a gun in self-defense, whereas, in the same study, 4% of those adolescents reported that someone had threatened them with a gun. In a 2015 study co-authored with Sara Solnick, Hemenway analyzed data from the NCVS from 2007 to 2011 and identified only 127 instances of DGU. Other A study published in 2013 by the Violence Policy Center, using five years of nationwide statistics (2007-2011) compiled by the Federal Bureau of Investigation found that defensive gun uses occur an average of 67,740 times per year.http://www.vpc.org/studies/justifiable.pdf, retrieved 10/29/2014 A 2004 study surveyed the records of a Phoenix, Arizona newspaper, as well as police and court records, and found a total of 3 instances of defensive gun use over a 3.5 month period. In contrast, Kleck and Gertz's study would predict that the police should have noticed more than 98 DGU killings or woundings and 236 DGU firings at adversaries during this time. A 1995 study led by Arthur Kellermann, which examined 198 home invasion crimes in Atlanta, Georgia, found that in only 3 of these cases did victims use guns for self-protection. Of these three, none were injured, but one lost property. The authors concluded that \\"Although firearms are often kept in the home for protection, they are rarely used for this purpose.\\" A follow-up study in 1998 by Arthur Kellermann analyzed 626 shootings in three cities. The study found that \\"For every time a gun in the home was used in a self-defense or legally justifiable shooting, there were four unintentional shootings, seven criminal assaults or homicides, and 11 attempted or completed suicides.\\" The Gun Violence Archive, which uses a methodology of counting incidents reported and verified by law enforcement or media, reports substantially lower numbers of defensive gun use in the US than studies based on polls. 1,980 and 2,043 incidents were reported and verified in 2016 and 2017, respectively. An interactive visualization of recent defensive gun use instances starting in 2019 is being tracked by The Heritage Foundation's Defensive Gun Uses in the U.S. Data points include date, location (city/state), context (eg home invasion, domestic violence, etc), whether the gun owner held a concealed carry permit, whether multiple assailants were present, whether shots were fired, type of firearm used for defense, and miscellaneous details. Benefits The same data indicating that DGU against criminals is uncommon also indicates that it is often effective. A 2002 study looking at instances of DGU where convicted offenders were the defenders found that DGUs \\"are not likely to provide similar social benefits, implying that prevalence estimates may not simultaneously estimate social benefits.\\" Another study published the same year found that DGU is an effective deterrent against injury for some groups of people, but not others; notable groups for whom DGU did not provide benefits in this study included women, people living in rural areas, and those living in low-income homes. A 2009 study reported that gun owners were more likely to be shot in an assault than were non-gun owners, and concluded that the chances of DGU being successful for residents of urban areas may be low. Another 2009 study of NCVS data found that DGU was \\"most often effective at helping the victim\\" in the contexts in which it occurred, with an average of 92% of victims reporting that their DGU had been beneficial for them. A 2013 National Research Council report found that studies looking at the effectiveness of different self-protective strategies had consistently found that victims who used guns defensively had lower injury rates than did victims who used other strategies. A 2015 study by Solnick and Hemenway which analyzed NCVS data reported \\"little evidence that [DGU] is uniquely beneficial in reducing the likelihood of injury or property loss.\\" Predictors of defensive gun use Individuals who use guns defensively tend not to have extremely punitive attitudes toward criminals, but people with punitive attitudes may be somewhat more likely to own guns, and, thus, to use them defensively. A 2009 study found no support for the \\"Southern culture of honor\\" hypothesis, in that no significant relationship was seen between living in the Southern United States and defensive gun use.

It was established to aid in the recovery of East Prussia after its separation from Weimar Germany following World War I. History Lord Mayor Hans Lohmeyer came up with the idea for a trade fair in K√∂nigsberg to inspire optimism and improve the economy; similar post-war fairs were held in Breslau (Wroc≈Çaw), Frankfurt, and Pozna≈Ñ.Gause, p. 46 The first Ostmesse, opened by President Friedrich Ebert on 26 September 1920, was held in the K√∂nigsberg Zoo and encompassed 50,000 m2.Albinus, p. 233 The following year the Ostmesse moved to a new site designed by Hanns Hopp along Wallring and Hansaring, just north of Steindamm and Tragheim. This permanent site initially encompassed 60,000 m2 and was financed with 7.5 million Mark from the German government and 2.5 million from the Free State of Prussia. Seven halls covering 23,000 m2 were subsequently constructed.Gause, p. 47 The Handelshof was built nearby from 1922-23, but was infrequently used and instead became the new city hall. Beginning in 1925 technical demonstrations were held in the Haus der Technik. By the end of the 1920s the Ostmesse encompassed 80,000 m2. Plans to expand westward in the vicinity of the Nordbahnhof station were halted by the outbreak of World War II. The early fairs were provincial and largely agricultural in nature, but well received by East Prussians. A popular description of the fair was \\"Des ganzen Ostens Presse meist die K√∂nigsberger Messe preist\\" (the entire eastern press praised the K√∂nigsberg fair). The Spring 1922 fair included 1,650 firms, while the Fall 1923 fair featured 2,500 exhibitors. Besides the featured goods and technical exhibitions, later fairs included construction, cattle, fishing, hunting, and other special shows.Gause, p. 48 The tenth fair was opened on 17 February 1925 by Chancellor Hans Luther. Foreign participation increased as the fair grew and included Estonia, Finland, Hungary, Latvia, Poland, Sweden, Turkey, and especially the Soviet Union. K√∂nigsberg's Ostmesse and the Leipzig Trade Fair were recognized as the only official German trade fairs. The first Fair was held in September 1920 after which they were held in February and August,Statistisches Jahrbuch der Stadt K√∂nigsberg Pr. 1930 p.87 until 1928, when for economic reasons they began to be held annually instead, usually in late August. The Ostmesse had 1,873 firms and 65,000 visitors in 1930, 120,000 visitors in 1933, and 204,000 visitors in 1937. The fair was directed by Dr. Erich Wiegand until 1930, when he was succeeded by Consul Hans Jonas. The final fair was held in October 1941 during World War II.

Copies of the Reigning Icon of the Mother of God can now be found all over the world.\\"Yazykova (2010), page 49. Origins The icon was originally venerated in the Ascension Convent, in the Chertolye neighborhood near the Moscow Kremlin.

Reappearance At the end of the \\"February Revolution\\" of 1917 (February in the Old Russian Calendar), on 2 March (Julian Calendar)/ 15 March (Gregorian Calendar) 1917, Tsar Nicholas II of Russia abdicated the throne after riots in Petrograd spiraled out of control. That same day, Evdokia Adrianova, a peasant woman in the village of Pererva in Moscow Province, dreamed that the Blessed Virgin appeared and spoke to her.Irina Yazykova (2010), Hidden and Triumphant: The Underground Struggle to Save Russian Iconography, Paraclete Press. Page 47. She was instructed to travel to the village of Kolomenskoye, where she would find an old icon which, \\"will change color from black to red.\\"Yazykova (2010), pages 47-48. Upon her arrival, the parish priest took Evdokia at her word and together they searched until they found, in an old storage room, an icon covered with candle soot. But as they took the icon outdoors, the sunlight revealed that the Mother of God was wearing the scarlet robes of a monarch. She also wore the Imperial crown and held a sceptre and globus cruciger ‚Äî the symbols of regal authority. Interpretation According to Irina Yazykova, \\"Since all this took place on the same day as the Emperor's abdication from the throne, the appearance of the icon was immediately thought to be connected with that event. What is more, the priest was given to understand that the Crown that had fallen from the head of the Tsar had been taken up by the Theotokos, the Mother of God: henceforth, She would be the reigning Tsarina of the Russian State. Thus the icon was named the 'Reigning' icon and became widely revered among the Russian people\\"Yazykova (2010), page 48. Russian monarchists believe the reappearance of the icon was an indication that the Virgin Mary was displeased with Russia for dethroning Tsar Nicholas II during the February Revolution.

Steen was appointed by Governor Rick Perry on November 27, 2012 after Esperanza Andrade resigned four days earlier from the position that she had held for more than four years. Steen is Texas' 108th Secretary of State and one of six officials to have formed the Executive Department of state government. After just over a year in the position, Steen resigned and was succeeded on January 7, 2014, by another Perry appointee, Nandita Berry, an Indian native and naturalized American citizen from Houston. Background Steen is one of five children born to John Steen, Sr. (1922-2003), a native of Yoakum in southeast Texas, who owned insurance companies and also held ranching interests in surrounding counties. His mother was the former Nell Donnell, who predeceased her husband. The senior Steen was the last chairman of the San Antonio Good Government League and was active in the 1976 United States Bicentennial and in the National Conference of Christians and Jews. For twenty years, the senior Steen was an elected member of the Alamo Community College District. He served two terms on the San Antonio City Council and was an unsuccessful candidate for mayor in 1981 to succeed Lila Cockrell, but Henry Cisneros was instead elected to the first of four two-year terms in the position. Steen is married to the former Ida Louise Clement, a past member of the Texas State Preservation Board in Austin, the panel which oversees the management of the State Capitol, the governor's mansion, and the Bob Bullock Texas State History Museum. She is a former regent of the Texas A&M; University System. Mrs. Steen is a descendant of Richard King, the steamboat captain who in 1853 established the King Ranch, still owned by her family. Her father, James H. Clement, was the president and chief executive of King Ranch. Her paternal grandfather, Martin W. Clement, was the president and chairman of the Pennsylvania Railroad. Her maternal grandfather, John A. Larkin, was a founder and the vice chairman of the Celanese Corporation of America, now based in Dallas. The Steens have three children, John Steen, III, James Higbie Clement \\"Jamey\\" Steen, and Ida \\"Illa\\" Louise Larkin Steen Gaunt, who is married to William Hartley Gaunt of Houston, who has roots in Indiana and Kansas. The Gaunts were wed at the King Ranch in 2012.

Its name means \\"Abraham‚Äôs garden\\"; the reference to the common ancestor of both Jewish and Islamic traditions intending to imply a unifying theme. The band was called a pioneer in the realm of world music.  History  The band was born of jam sessions organized during several months by the qanun player and music promoter Avshalom Farjun, in collaboration with the violin and oud player Taiseer Elias. These sessions brought together musicians with various musical backgrounds such as Arab music, Turkish music, jazz, flamenco, western classical music, and blues. Eight musicians finally stayed to form Bustan Abraham. They made their debut at the Israeli International Arts Festival. The band was collaborative: each member brought his own ideas and composed part of the repertoire, and although it was composed mainly of Israeli Jewish musicians, two of its members were Palestinians. Thank to this mix, it was perceived as a symbol of bringing the two groups together. The members nevertheless always insisted on the fact that their approach was foremost a musical one. Their aim was to drag from different traditions to create an entirely new music. In the years which followed the signing of the Oslo agreements, the group played in numerous concerts and festivals in Europe, Asia and United States. It also recorded with musicians of different backgrounds, like Ross Daly, Hariprasad Chaurasia, Keyvan Chemirani and Zakir Hussain. Their albums generally sold about 25 0000 copies each. Three of Bustan Abraham‚Äôs members, (Taiseer Elias, Zohar Fresco and Nassim Dakwar also performed in trio with a more specifically Arabo-Turkish repertoire, under the name of Zyriab Trio. Taiseer Elias and Miguel Herstein performed in duo under the name White Bird. After Benjamin Netanyahu became Prime Minister, in 1996, and even more after the beginning of the Second Intifada, in 2000, invitations abroad became scarcer. The band finally disbanded in 2003, as different viewpoints had emerged on the musical direction to take and as several of its musicians were increasingly busy with other projects. Some of its members kept on playing together on an occasional basis and four of them formed a new band at the end of 2011, Bustan Quartet. They performed in festivals in the United States and in Israel.

He was the inspiration for the character Omar Little on the HBO series The Wire. Early life Andrews grew up in a housing project in West Baltimore, Maryland. He was physically abused by his mother. At the age of 9, he witnessed a man being beaten to death over 15 cents ().  Life of crime  Andrews became a stickup artist who robbed drug dealers, but his code of ethics included never involving women nor children. He was known to police for armed robbery and drug dealing in the 1970s and early 1980s in Baltimore. In 1986, local drug kingpin Warren Boardley convinced Andrews (who needed to support his heroin addiction) and Reggie Gross to take on the contract killing of Zachary Roach and Rodney \\"Touche\\" Young. Filled with guilt, Andrews surrendered himself to Ed Burns, a homicide detective with the Baltimore Police Department. Working with Burns, he agreed to wear a covert listening device, which he used to implicate Boardley and Gross in the killings. In 1987, Andrews was sentenced to life in prison for the two murders. He was denied parole on his first attempts, but continued to study, ended his addiction to heroin, and helped other inmates by running an anti-gang workshop. While Andrews was in prison, Detective Burns introduced him to Fran Boyd, who was the inspiration for the character of the same name in The Corner: A Year in the Life of an Inner-City Neighborhood, a 1997 book by Burns and David Simon. Andrews and Boyd's first conversation came in January 1993, when Boyd was still using drugs. Andrews encouraged Boyd to get clean.  The Wire  By 1998, Burns and Simon, as well as the lead prosecutor who obtained Andrews' conviction, began to lobby for Andrews' release from prison. While Andrews was in prison, Simon sent him copies of the newspaper, and Andrews gave Simon information about crimes taking place in Baltimore. Simon named Andrews a consultant on The Wire, an HBO show about crime in Baltimore which ran from 2002‚Äì2008. Simon used Andrews as one of the inspirations for the character Omar Little, a stickup artist who never targeted innocent bystanders. Andrews was released from prison in 2005. He performed youth outreach after his release from prison. His foundation, Why Murder?, attempted to steer children away from a life of crime. He portrayed Donnie on The Wire, an associate of Omar and his advisor Butchie.  Personal life  Andrews and Fran Boyd married on August 11, 2007. Wedding guests included Simon and The Wire cast members Dominic West, Sonja Sohn, and Andre Royo.

Gordon Roberts Hospital, Shillong. Hughes trained as a surgeon in London prior to his time in India. He is called the \\"Schweitzer of Assam,\\" comparing his missionary work to that of the Nobel Peace Prize winner Albert Schweitzer. During his 40 years in India, Hughes expanded the Welsh Mission Hospital and developed a travelling dispensary to aid those in the surrounding providences. Hughes is best known for attempting to eradicate malaria from the area, introducing a vagus nerve resection process to alleviate pain from peptic ulcers and a rickets treatment in the infant population, recognising a protein calorie deficiency disorder called kwashiorkor in the Indian population, founding the area's first blood bank, performing the first lower segment Caesarean section without antibiotics to India, and expanding educational training for medical and nursing organisations. Early life Robert Arthur Hughes was born on 3 December 1910 to Reverend Howell Harris Hughes and Annie Myfanwy Hughes in Oswestry, a town in Shropshire, England. Shropshire is along the border of Wales, the country of origin for Hughes' parents. Robert Hughes and his brother, John Harris Hughes, were twins, though Robert was older and had better health during their youth. Rev. Howell Harris Hughes, named after Howell Harris, was the Minister at Oswald Road Presbyterian in addition to being a pacifist and involved in the Fellowship of Reconciliation in Wales. Annie Hughes was educated at the University of Wales in Bangor and became headmistress at a school in Rhosllannerchrugog until her marriage to Hughes. During World War I, Howell Harris was Minister of the Tabernacle Chapel in Bangor, Gwynedd, and Arthur and Harris attended Christchurch School in Waterloo and then the Waterloo and Seaforth Grammar School during this time. When the boys were fifteen, the family moved to Llandudno, where they attended the John Bright School. Robert Hughes excelled in both academics and athletics. Harris Hughes was sickly during his youth and attended the University of Wales in Bangor and became an ordained Minister after attending the United Theological College in Aberystwth. He was eventually elected Moderator of the Presbyterian Church of Wales in 1975. Education In 1928, Robert Hughes entered Liverpool University to study medicine. During his time in the Faculty of Medicine, Hughes joined the Student Christian Movement and the Student Volunteer Movement Union. He was awarded the gold medal in surgery and two other academic distinctions when he graduated in 1933. After graduating in Medicine, Hughes as a House Surgeon worked at Royal Southern Hospital under the instruction of Mr. O. Herbert Williams, a distinguished surgeon. When he finished his time as House Surgeon, Hughes joined the medical firm of the same hospital under Dr. Norman Capon and worked as House Physician. Hughes then decided to pursue a career in surgical medicine and was appointed the John Rankin Fellow in Human Anatomy, as anatomical knowledge was a requirement for the first FRCS examination. After passing his first examination in 1935, Hughes spent a short amount of time as Junior Registrar at Stanley Hospital until he became Surgical Registrar and Assistant Surgical Pathologist at David Lewis Northern Hospital. In 1936, Hughes received his diploma MRCS, LRCP. After an unsuccessful first attempt, Hughes passed the final FRCS examination in 1937, becoming a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of England. In August 1937, Hughes applied to become a missionary for the Presbyterian Church of Wales. At the time, the Foreign Missions Committee of the church had two doctors applying but three hospitals in need of aid. Once the Foreign Mission Committee accepted Hughes in 1937, he was sent to the London School of Tropical Medicine to receive his diploma in Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, or DTM&H.; Hughes was assigned to join Dr. Roberts in Shillong upon the completion of his Tropical Medicine course. Marriage to Nancy Hughes While working at the David Lewis Northern Hospital, Hughes met Ann \\"Nancy\\" Beatrice Wright, who was working as a nurse. Nancy was born on 27 September 1908, to William and Mary Elizabeth Wright, and was the middle of three children. She grew up in Claughton, Birkenhead and attended nursing school in Liverpool. She worked at the Isolation Hospital in Bidston for three years to begin her training, and then took a job at Northern Hospital. Although she would return to Northern, she was accepted a position at Oxford Street Maternity Hospital to complete a course in midwifery training. Upon returning the Northern, she met Hughes, who was working there as a surgical tutor. The two were married on 7 January 1939, and left for India three weeks later. Although Nancy was a trained nurse, the policy of the Mission Society prohibited her from working in the hospital. While Robert Hughes was away during World War II, Nancy Hughes resumed her duties as a nurse, tending to injured Allied soldiers at Dr. H. Gordon Roberts Hospital. Medical mission in India On 28 January 1939, the Hughes' left Liverpool for India aboard the City of Marseilles and in February they arrived at the Welsh Mission Hospital in Shillong, which was founded by Dr. Hugh Gordon Roberts in 1922 to serve the Khasi people. Hughes was given charge of the general wards while Dr. Roberts took care of administrative matters until 1942. Upon that time, Hughes was appointed Senior Medical Officer. During daily life at the hospital, Hughes cared for patients suffering from road accidents, animal mauling, diphtheria, malaria, typhoid, dysentery, leprosy, and tuberculosis. When World War II reached Assam, Hughes was inducted into the British army in 1942 to serve as a liaison on the health of the Kohima and Dimapur Road workers between health officials and the British army. Hughes was forced to return to Shillong as fighting intensified and the local hospitals were the main recipients of soldiers from the Burma Road. From his return until 1945, Hughes was the consulting surgeon at two local military hospitals as well as Senior Medical Officer at the Welsh Mission Hospital. During this time he treated 2,851 patients, many of whom were British officers and soldiers. After the War, Hughes turned his attention back to the Welsh Mission Hospital. Hughes constructed and installed the first central heating system in northeastern India to heat the hospital, and also created a steam dryer and cooking range. Due to the lack of a missionary colleague, Hughes began medical education programs for local men and women. In 1947, Hughes began a travelling dispensary to make weekly visits to marketplaces around Shillong to distribute medical care and health education, which he would do for 20 years. He used this time to survey the health of the villages, and turned his attention towards maternal and infant health. Hughes developed midwifery training for local women and a maternity unit in the Mission Hospital to improve health. He also became involved in advocacy, joining different social, medical, nursing, and welfare organisations with the goal of improving local health. Hughes worked at the Welsh Mission Hospital until 1969, when he and Nancy returned to Wales. Religious involvement in the Welsh Presbyterian Church While in India in 1944, Hughes was elected an elder in the Shillong branch of the Presbyterian Church, with his main responsibility being religious education. When he began his travelling dispensary in 1947, Hughes intended to deliver medical care as well as evangelical sermons. In 1971, Hughes was elected an elder by the Presbyterian Church in Liverpool, and was elected Moderator of the Presbyterian Church of Wales in 1992. In 1991, the Hughes returned to Shillong to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the arrival of Welsh Presbyterian missionary involvement in northeastern India. Legacy Hughes is known for performing several operations for the first time in India, such as the lower segment Caesarean section without antibiotics and vagus nerve resection process to alleviate pain from peptic ulcers. He also introduced ether to northeastern Indian hospitals as a form of general anaesthesia, recognised and began treating rickets in the Khasi infant population, and developed India-specific treatments for kwashiorkor, a protein calorie deficiency disorder. Under Hughes' direction, the Welsh Mission Hospital in 1942 employed more nurses and staff than the rest of the hospitals in Assam combined, as well as performed more surgeries. Hughes began the first blood bank in Shillong to meet the medical needs of his patients. As a result of these achievements, Hughes is known by many as the \\"Schweitzer of Assam.\\" Hughes died Saturday, 1 June 1996, at the Cardiothoracic Hospital in Liverpool.
