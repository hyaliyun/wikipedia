He was known for killing three Syrian truck drivers in Iraq in the summer of 2013. He and three others were killed in a United States-led coalition airstrike in May 2016, according to the US Department of Defense.  Biography  Fahdawi was born in 1986. In 2006, while studying computer science at the University of Anbar, he was arrested by US forces on charges of belonging to Al-Qaeda in Iraq. Following his arrest, Fahdawi was detained by US forces at the Camp Bucca detention facility in southern Iraq until 2009, when he was sentenced to death and moved to Tikrit Central Prison in Saladin Governorate. Fahdawi was one of 110 detainees who escaped the prison in 2012, following a riot and an attack by forces from the Islamic State of Iraq. He had learnt from the senior ISIS leaders he had been imprisoned with, and he became a field commander in Anbar province after his release. Iraqi officials blamed him for a long list of terror-related offences and put a $50,000 bounty on him.

Developed by Prof. Ken Goldberg and the CITRIS Data and Democracy Initiative at UC Berkeley with California Lt. Governor Gavin Newsom, version 1.0 was released in January 2014. On the CRC site, participants are encouraged to grade California on a scale from A+ to F on six timely topics and to propose their own suggestions of issues that merit attention at the state level. The CRC is a form of E-democracy, structuring and streamlining communication from the California residents to their elected officials.  History  The CRC builds on aspects of two earlier programs: Opinion Space and the World Bank's Citizen Report Card. Opinion Space, developed at UC Berkeley between 2009 and 2011, is a social media technology developed to assist communities in exchanging ideas and opinions concerning current issues and policies. From 2010-2014, the US State Department used a version of Opinion Space to solicit suggestions on foreign policy from participants around the world. The CRC augments the Opinion Space platform, and applies its techniques of deliberative polling, collaborative filtering and multidimensional visualization. The CRC moves Opinion Space to a mobile-optimized platform and builds on the original system by adding a citizen report card. Friday, 13 January 2017 The World Bank first developed “citizen report cards” in Bangalore, India in 1993. These report cards work to stimulate public feedback on government actions and prompt individuals to express their opinions and ideas. The report cards allow for participants to assess the ideas of others and bring popular suggestions to the attention of elected leaders. The goals of the CRC are quite similar to those of the Citizen Report Cards. Gavin Newsom’s first book, Citizenville: How to Take the Town Square Digital and Reinvent Government, published in 2013, argues for the value of projects like the CRC. Citizenville contrasts the powerful and innovative role of technology in the lives of everyday citizens and the comparatively traditional policies of the government. Newsom emphasizes the potential for technological growth and expansion in the California government. Today's technology offers a plethora of ways to connect the public directly to the government. Citizenville stresses that modern technology should be utilized to foster and enhance political participation. Newsom played an active role in development of the CRC and worked closely with the team at UC Berkeley. Newsom commented: “The California Report Card is a new way for me to keep an ear to the ground. This new app/website makes it easy for Californians to assign grades suggest pressing issues that merit our attention. In the first months, participants conveyed that they approve of our rollout of Obamacare but are very concerned about the future of California schools and universities. There was also statewide support for increased attention to Disaster Preparedness, so this has become one of my top priorities.\\" The CRC is an application of the greater “CAFE” platform, an acronym for the Collective Assessment and Feedback Engine, and began development in earnest with the support of Newsom. Professor of engineering and Faculty Director of the Data and Democracy Initiative Ken Goldberg leads the CAFE team at UC Berkeley. Separate applications of the same platform in areas such as disaster preparedness, measurement of online learning, and humanitarian interventions are in development.  Features  Participants are first directed to grade the six current topics. The median grade is revealed as users enter their grades. Participants then submit their zip codes and enter an online “café”. The page design draws on the metaphor of the café in which users can discuss their suggestions and opinions over a cup of coffee. Participants click on the mugs and read the ideas of other users, grading the importance and relevance of each suggestion. After evaluating two other suggestions, participants are prompted to enter their own textual submissions. Each mug represents a participant. The mugs are placed on the table using principal component analysis (PCA). The sampling algorithm used to place mugs favors suggestions that have fewer votes, ensuring that each idea is sufficiently graded. The CRC system tracks the standard error of the grades for each mug, and places each suggestion strategically in an effort to equalize the standard error overall.  Version 1.0  The CRC’s first version was released on January 28, 2014. Version 1.0 included six issues for participants to grade within the following categories: Healthcare, Education, Marriage Equality, Immigrant Rights, and Marijuana Decriminalization. As of June 2014, over 8,000 people from every county in California have assigned approximately 25,000 grades. The data collected from version 1.0 of the CRC has been organized and posted on the official website. The next version will be released fall of 2014 and the CRC team plans to implement a Spanish version of the platform as well.  Version 2.0  Officially released on 23 September, National Voter Registration Day, Version 2.0 of the California Report Card is designed to engage the 30% of Californians who speak Spanish at home. All content is now available in English and Spanish, with rapid translation of new input and a streamlined new graphic design.

Health World’s mission is to promote health and safety education by providing children with the information they need to build healthy lives. Health World was founded by a group of community residents led by Peter Rusin, CEO of JFK Medical Center at the time. The rising number of health-related issues confronting children and adolescents concerned this group of community leaders. They chose to focus and build health curriculums dedicated specifically to the needs of children pre-K through 8th grade. In 1995 Health World opened the $12 million, 85,000 square foot children’s museum ‘JFK Health World’ in Chicago, Illinois. Health World has since taught over 4,000,000 kids about making healthy choices. The museum would teach kids about making correct health choices, as well as give safety information and lectures to kids, such as teaching the Heimlich maneuver. In 2006 Health World expanded its regional education efforts when it closed the museum and transitioned to outreach education. In 2013 Health World made its preK-8th grade programs and education resources available nationwide via an online eLearning platform. Currently Health World programs are being utilized by educators in all 50 states.

Based on the geometry of the slab, and the relative movement of the tectonic plates, the slip vector is likely to have been oblique down-dip towards the ESE. The fault plane appears to be oblique, striking NW-SE and cutting steeply into the subducting slab.

It operated from 1976 until its sale in 1984. The bank was founded by a group of area businesswomen, which included Virginia Mullan, Laura Liswood, Cappy Fogel, Betty Lessner, Veryl Mortenson, Lee Agajanian, Dianne Freestone (Modisett) Kully, Helene Beck and Julann Griffin. Griffin is the former wife of producer/entertainer Merv Griffin, and she was instrumental in convincing celebrities to buy stock in the bank and open accounts. Florence Henderson was the bank's first customer, and eventually Jane Fonda, Loretta Swit, Phyllis Diller, Farrah Fawcett and Anne Bancroft all had accounts there. The bank's mission was expressly feminist. The bank's board of directors believed that many women did not have enough experience with personal finance or the same access to credit as men. The bank therefore focused on helping women manage their money, especially after divorce. Ironically, when the Board first searched for a CEO they were unable to find a qualified woman. Therefore, Rowan Henry, a man, was hired. By late 1976, more than $1.5 million in stock had been sold to about 1300 shareholders, 63% of whom were women. Asked in the Occidental College Alumni magazine what it means to be a bank for women, Board member Dianne Modisett answered, \\"It means that we eliminate discrimination on the basis of sex. An individual must still qualify for credit or a loan, but if she doesn't, we want to assist her in becoming qualified… It doesn't make any difference to us whether the woman is single, married, divorced or widowed.\\" The First Women's Bank struggled to broaden its appeal beyond a small, politically-engaged customer base. In 1984, it was sold for $2.7 million and reorganized as the Guaranty Bank of California, now GBC International Bank.

The whiskey was originally distilled by Tennessee Distilling Company, a corporation founded in 2009 in Franklin, Tennessee, by former Tennessee state representative Mike Williams. The brand was sold to North Coast Spirits, a California business group, in 2014, but distillation and other operations remained in Nashville.  History  After President Washington stopped the Whiskey Rebellion in Pennsylvania in 1794, two whiskey makers from Virginia and North Carolina – William Collier and James McKeel – feared similar events could happen in their own states, so they moved to Tennessee, where they used their knowledge of Scottish and Irish whiskey making to make their own sour mash whiskey. Centuries later, Collier and McKeel's whiskey history began again when Mike Williams, who is a descendant of the original whiskey makers, helped pass new legislation that revised Tennessee state laws related to distilling in 2009. Prior to the passing of the bill, alcohol could only be distilled in three Tennessee counties: Coffee, Moore and Lincoln (origin of the Lincoln County Process used to make Tennessee whiskey). Williams opened the first Collier and McKeel distillery in the old Marathon Auto Works building (next to Corsair Artisan Distillery), located near the state capitol building in Nashville in 2009. The first distilled whiskeys – aged in 5-gallon and 15-gallon barrels – were available for sale in 2011. The original product line consisted of Tennessee whiskey, a cinnamon whiskey, a vodka, and a white dog unaged whiskey – also known as moonshine. In 2012, Collier and McKeel moved its distillery operations to the Speakeasy Spirits (now Pennington Distilling Co.) complex in West Nashville. Speakeasy used Collier and McKeel Tennessee whiskey in combination with other flavors to create Whisper Creek Tennessee Sipping Cream at a milder 40 proof. Nashville chef Deb Paquette helped create the recipe. In May 2013, Collier and McKeel signed an agreement with The Vintner Group to expand distribution to parts of the East Coast. The deal made the distillery's whiskey available to liquor stores and restaurants in Maryland, Delaware, Florida and Washington D.C. and designated Rhode Island, New York, Connecticut, New Jersey and Massachusetts in the Northeast and Indiana and Illinois in the Midwest as distribution targets. Mike Williams called the deal a \\"major move\\" for the company. In May 2014, he announced the sale of Collier and McKeel to North Coast Spirits.  Whiskey  Collier and McKeel Tennessee Whiskey uses a 70/15/15 corn, barley and rye mash with ingredients obtained from local farms. That includes using limestone-filtered water from Big Richland Creek on Collier Farm (which belongs to the Williams family) in Humphreys County. The whiskey is filtered using the Lincoln County Process – a requirement for all Tennessee whiskeys (except Prichard's) – but Collier and McKeel alters the method slightly by pumping the whiskey slowly through the charcoal instead of using gravity to drip the liquid through the charcoal. The company originally used small casks for aging but added traditional 53-gallon barrel sizes for aging in 2013. According to master distiller Mike Williams, \\"Nothing can take the place of time, but the 15-gallon barrels allowed us to age the whiskey a little more quickly to start.\\" After 2013, the company focused on larger barrels with only limited production of smaller barrel whiskeys. The brand also started using a new label that featured \\"Pappy,\\" the distillery's 560-gallon copper still, Big Richland Creek and a rustic barn. Each bottle included a real thumbprint added by Mike Williams. Collier and McKeel's unaged white dog whiskey received a silver medal from the American Distilling Institute in 2012 in the Artisan American Spirits category. Wine Enthusiast gave the Collier and McKeel Tennessee Whiskey a score of 92 and rated it Best of Year in 2016.

More information on the history of AEV can be found on the American Expedition Vehicles page here on wiki. The AEV Brute is a pickup truck that is modified from the Jeep Wrangler SUV platform. It was offered for both the Wrangler TJ and JK models. American parts and vehicles producer AEV first developed a single cab versions, on a stretched Wrangler TJ chassis, which was made available mostly in kit-form, although completely modified Wrangler Brute pickups could also be ordered from AEV, from about 2007 to 2011.American Expedition Vehicles – AEV Brute TJ Wrangler Pickup Conversion (archived 02-2007)American Expedition Vehicles – AEV Brute TJ Wrangler Jeep Pickup Truck Conversion (archived 12-2011) In 2011 AEV developed a significantly larger double cab pickup, based on a stretched JK Wrangler Unlimited chassis, which was available for four years, from 2013 to 2017.https://news.classiccars.com/driven-2015-aev-jeep-brute/  Build Process  The build process for an AEV TJ based Brute was built in stages or all at once with a kit. The kit included items such as a mid-frame section, a cab closeout, a single cab hardtop, a bed and tailgate, and body mounts. The conversion process started with a 1997 - 2006 Jeep wrangler which then had the interior parts removed to allow access to the floor of the vehicle. Continuing with drilling out spot welds and cutting sections of the floor and sides of the tub the body can be removed. With the body removed the frame extension would need to be welded in by cutting a section of frame and making sure everything is straight. The front section of the tub can be placed back onto the extended frame once the cab closeout is installed. The bed can be installed and adjusted before final alignment. Paint and body work is one of the last stages that will take place. The interior can also be installed to complete the conversion.  Options and Packages  = 1997 - 2006 AEV Brute Options (TJ Wrangler Based)[edit] = An option to the AEV TJ based Brute was a Highline kit. This kit raised the fenders approximately 3 inches to allow the vehicle to have a smaller lift while still having large tires. As Four Wheeler Magazine would write \\"A newer and nicer way to go would be to opt for the AEV highline kit which actually provides you with factory-quality stamped- steel highline fenders that bolt in place of your stock units.\\" AEV offered the Brute with a range of engine choices including either the factory 4.0L I6 or a 5.7L HEMI V8. = 2013 - 2017 AEV Brute Packages (JK Wrangler Based)[edit] = The factory could out fit a Double Cab (DC) Brute with the factory 3.6L Pentastar V6, a 5.7L HEMI V8, or a 6.4L 392 HEMI V8. Some packages that were available were listed below. * DC 250 * DC 350 * Filson Edition = Custom Built AEV Brutes = Custom Jeeps are not hard to find, this makes the TJ Brute and the JK Brute suitable bases for modifications as well.

He commonly signed his paintings \\"H. H. Calvert\\". Biography  Herbert Hepburn Calvert was born on 30 December 1870 in London. He was the first son of journalist Thomas Calvert and his wife Grace (née Hepburn). In 1887 the family emigrated to Sydney, Australia where in 1904 H. H. Calvert married Mary Elsie O’Brien. Calvert was known for his watercolours depicting Australian bird life. He was active from at least 1910 until his death in 1923 and is represented in the collections of the Mitchell Library, State Library of New South Wales and the Art Gallery of New South Wales. The work of Calvert's younger son, Harold Hepburn Calvert (1906-1963), is often incorrectly attributed to his father. This misidentification is exacerbated by both men having similar names and painting careers which overlapped in the early 1920s. In terms of subject matter, style and medium, Harold's art mirrored that of Herbert, however, the son usually signed his paintings as H. Hep. Calvert or H. Hepburn Calvert which helps differentiate his output. Calvert died in Adelaide on 16 February 1923 and was subsequently buried at the Field of Mars Cemetery in the Sydney suburb of Ryde. He was survived by his wife and sons Herbert and Harold.

At the time of its failure it was the largest finance company in New Zealand. The Hanover Group also had interests in property and was responsible for developing Matarangi Beach Estates and golf course, and acquired completed lots at the Jacks Point property sub-division in Queenstown. The Group also had property and finance interests in Australia. History Mark Hotchin and business partner Eric Watson bought Elders Finance in 1999. Elders, and a number of other finance companies, were brought together to create Hanover Group. With $650 million in assets, this was New Zealand's third largest finance company at the time. In 2007, Forbes listed Hotchin and Watson as the 33rd and 34th richest people in New Zealand and Australia. Hotchin's interests ranged outside the traditional finance company model. In 2003 Hotchin through the Hanover Group bought a 10% stake in Tower, a large fund management and insurance business. Hanover wanted a better deal for investors and forced Tower and owners GPG to review the capital raising and underwrite deal they had agreed. In 2007 Hanover Group made an after tax profit of $105m. Controversially Hanover Finance paid NZ$45.5 million in dividends to Hotchin and Watson in the year ending 30 June 2008. Much of these dividends were then reinvested back into the company to reduce related party transactions, which at the time were around 14% of the loan book. =Start of decline 2008= As a result of the continuing worsening global financial crisis in July 2008 Hanover Finance and United Finance froze repayments of NZ$554 million owed to 36,500 investors. After a vote over 85% of investors agreed to a debt repayment plan for the return of their capital over a 5-year time scale, predicated on the recovery of the New Zealand property market. Hotchin and Watson pledged a property, benefits and cash package worth up to $96m to investors as part of the deal. By November 2009 accountancy firm PwC estimated that the package had fallen in value to between $36 million and $56 million, due to a fall in property prices. Over the first year of the debt repayment plan, six cents in the dollar was repaid to investors, however the property market had continued to worsen and it appeared the company was heading for receivership. In 2009 Hanover was approached by Allied Farmers to buy the assets of Hanover Finance and United Finance, effectively held in limbo by the repayment plan. In December 2009 Hanover Group debenture holders, note holders and bond holders were given another opportunity to vote for receivership or for the new plan with Allied. 75% voted in favour of swapping their debentures, notes and bonds for shares in Allied Farmers Limited. This transaction resulted in Allied Farmers assuming the net asset position of the Hanover Group finance companies. =Failure= Allied Farmers put their finance company Allied Nationwide into receivership on 20 August 2010 and as at March 2011 shares in were worth only a fraction of what they were traded for. =Aftermath= In late December 2011, the Financial Markets Authority (FMA) announced that it proposed to file civil proceedings against the directors and promoters of Hanover Finance Limited and other companies relating to statements made in the December 2007 prospectuses and subsequent advertisements. As a result of the FMA's announcement former Hanover Finance's chairman Greg Muir issued a media statement saying that \\"the FMA investigators were given a substantial amount of evidence demonstrating that the directors conducted themselves responsibly, with appropriate rigour, and made judgments they believed were in the best interests of the company and its investors on the information available to them at the time.\\" In December 2012, the remaining property assets of Hanover and United Finance (with a book value of $13.5 million) were transferred from Allied Farmers to Crown Asset Management, the entity set up to hold assets from failed finance companies backed by the Government's deposit guarantee.

Born in Newfoundland Canada, he moved to maui when his father was stationed Hawaii. He still lives on Maui where he personally takes care of the research and development of his boards at his workshop on Nehe Place, in Haiku. At the young age of 15 years he shaped The shaper in the world of Surfing is the one who designs and manufactures surfboards. his first surfboard, showing a talent that led him to develop many innovative projects from surfing, to windsurfing, to tow-surfing, to kitesurfing, then on to stand up paddle boards. In the early 80’s Mike Waltze brought Jimmy Lewis into the limelight as the “shaper” of the moment, winning the \\"Aloha Classic\\" with one of Jimmy’s custom windsurf boards. In 1982 the French windsurfer Pascal Maka broke the speed sailing record on a windsurf board, reaching 27.8 knots,http://www.internationalwindsurfing.com/userfiles/documents/ISWC_The_History_of_Speed_Outright_Record.pdf using a board created by Jimmy Lewis specifically for the event. In 1986, Pascal Maka was the first windsurfer to break the speed sailing record from Timothy Colman's Crossbow II, which had held the record for six years. He reached a speed of 38.86 knotshttp://ifca.internationalwindsurfing.com/page0165v01.htm using a Jimmy Lewis board and a sail manufactured by Gaastra. The same day three other athletes broke the record before him: Eric Beale (36.73 knots), Jimmy Lewis (36.31 knots) and Fred Haywood (36.13). During the 1990s he began his collaboration with Bic and Sailboards Maui, developing models of commercial success. He also worked with Windsurfing International designing plugs for production boards, including the Windsurfer 99, among others. Then, around 1995, with Lou Wainman, a famous pioneer of kite surfing, he developed the first bidirectional board completely innovating the sport. In 2005 his interest in stand up paddle (SUP) began to grow, and he quickly became one of the protagonists of this new discipline shaping the first prototypes for Laird Hamilton. The Jimmy Lewis Cruise Control 11'0.7 is still in production and is the most sold stand up paddle board in the world. The Jimmy Lewis board is entirely hand-built in the Kinetic factory in Vietnam, using a sandwich- structured composite. Jimmy Lewis claims that the manufacturing is done almost exactly the same way as he builds boards on Maui using the same materials and techniques and, above all, with the same meticulous care and attention to detail. The kiter Niccolò Porcella, the SUP racer Paul Marconi, and his son (not an ASP Pro) Marlon Lewis are among his athletes using his boards.

The film received a standing ovation at its premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival and has gone on to have sold out screenings at major festival across the world including the BFI London Film Festival & Busan International Film Festival. The documentary chronicles the rise of the AAP, which was an independent political faction that gained traction through campaigns against the corruption in Indian politics and was headed by political leader Arvind Kejriwal. It captures the day-to-day functioning of the AAP between December 2012 and December 2013, concluding with the Delhi elections. The film released in India on 17 November 2017. The film was earlier known as \\"Proposition for a Revolution\\". Crowdfunding The movie was first conceived by Khushboo Ranka and Vinay Shukla as a way to continue the theme of documenting uprisings and protests happening around the world. Several documentaries had released about the Occupy Wallstreet movement in the United States, the Arab Spring protests in the Middle East and Northern Africa, and the protests of sovereignty and political corruption in The Ukraine, however there had not been a major documentary done about the Jan Lokpal protest movement in India. The makers of \\"An Insignificant Man\\" posted a 'plea' on their film site, making a case for the importance of their documentary, stating, \\"When we began shooting, nobody knew what lay in the future. Least of all, us. Today, we feel, we have a film that is a critical document, observing not just the evolution of a political party, but the gradual shift that we are beginning to witness in our political discourse. In the last year, we have been helped by friends who moved cities and jobs to work on this film and by colleagues who brought in their own resources. We managed to win the prestigious IDFA Bertha Grant for documentaries. We now come to you. Your support will enable us to make a better quality film in lesser time. It will also ensure that nothing can stop this film from reaching you. Please be a part of this conversation, and help us take it further. We have a host of exciting incentives too, do check them out on our page. We finished shooting a few months ago and now we need your help to take our film through post-production.\\" The film's site explains, \\"What is unique in the Indian story is that some of the protesters decided to form a political party and fight state-wide elections in New Delhi. This is the story of the Aam Aadmi Party or the Common Man’s Party. \\"An Insignificant Man\\" aims to chronicle the journey of the party from its formation in December 2012 to the Delhi state elections in December 2013.\\" The crowdfunding campaign received unprecedented support. While the filmmakers had an initial goal of $20,000, they went on to receive a staggering $120,000, nearly 600% over their target. This was the largest crowdfunding campaign of its kind in India, hosted by the filmmakers on their own platform. Production The production of the film is being done through crowdfunding. This form of production has become increasingly popular in Indian cinema due to the rise of a major independent film movement in the country. When asked in an interview with The Hindu, a major newspaper in India, on why the team chose crowdfunding, director Vinay Shukla said \\"Our film is a documentary set in contemporary politics and investors didn't find it an interesting proposition. Those interested in investing wanted to know if we were supporting AAP or against it,\\" Not wanting to compromise the neutral stand of their film, the team opted for crowd funding. The film has won support from the Sundance Institute, IDFA & Asian Network of Documentary Fund. The film was selected for and won awards at the Hot Docs Forum Toronto, NFDC Film Bazaar WIP Lab & DocEdge Kolkata.  Censorship in India  The film was initially denied a theatrical release in India by the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC). The filmmakers were directed by the board to get a No-Objection Certificate (NOC) from Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Arvind Kejriwal, former Delhi CM Sheila Dikshit. Further, the board had also asked them to remove references to the two biggest political parties in India, Congress and BJP from the documentary. Responding to the CBFC directive, Ranka said, \\"We are definitely not going to ask for NOCs from the PM or the CM. It would set a wrong precedent, apart from doing something unethical. It is not in the purview of the CBFC to protect the feelings of politicians. It is bizarre that one has to take their permission to critique or document their political activities.\\" In response, the filmmakers also launched a censorship awareness campaign which was supported by International Documentary Association(IDA) and European Documentary Network (EDN). The filmmakers later appealed to Film Certification Appellate Tribunal. The tribunal agreed with the filmmakers’ point of view that an NOC would defeat the purpose of a documentary and passed a landmark verdict in favour of the filmmakers. \\"There is considerable merit in the submission of the Appellant that requiring NOC from public personalities would cull the documentary cinema, rather render the making of a documentary on political scenario nigh impossible\\", the tribunal stated. \\"In these circumstances, requiring a filmmaker to obtain an NOC from the affected parties or characters in the film to whom references are made, is tantamount to the CBFC abdicating its statutory functions. This is neither desirable nor permissible at law.\\" About muting the names of political parties, the FCAT said, \\"Public interest is best served in upholding the Right to Freedom of Expression rather than protecting an undeserved reputation.\\" The film finally was cleared by the tribunal with a U/A certificate without any cuts. Release The film was released in theatres in India on 17 November 2017. Originally released in a limited number of theatres, the film was expanded to a nation wide release owing to great critical reception and box office collections in the first week. From there, it ran for 8 successive weeks in theatres, making it one of the most successful documentaries in India ever. The film has been acquired by Vice for a global television and digital release. Reception Business Standard wrote that the documentary \\"reminds one of Jehane Noujaim’s Oscar- nominated documentary The Square which took a compelling look at the protests at Cairo’s Tahrir Square.\\" Screen Daily commented that \\"Combining exceptional access and deft editing, this documentary about the rise of India’s newest parliamentary party, the Common Man’s Party (AAP), and the divisive, charismatic man at its heart, makes for unexpectedly riveting viewing.\\" Huffington Post listed the film among 12 Must-See Documentaries About Current World Politics. NDTV carried out promotional debates regarding the film.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZhrh1kyoRI In spite of tough competition from big commercial releases,http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/box-office- collection/an-insignificant-man-box-office-predictions-arvind-kejriwal- documentary-film-4939695/ the film went on to have a good theatrical run and has been loved by audiences. Reza Noorani writing for The Times of India praises the flawless editing, stating \\"Editing by Abhinav Tyagi and Manan Bhatt is clearly the strongest part of the entire documentary. The way they have maintained a coherent narrative makes you feel as if you’re watching a taut thriller; they keep you glued till the very last moment.\\" and gave the film 4/5 rating and film enjoys a user rating of 4.2/5. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a fresh 89% approval rating and the audience polled for IMDB gave the film 8.6/10 ratings. = Awards and selections= TIFF 2016, IDFA 2016, BFI London Film Festival 2016, CPH:DOX 2016,FIFDH 2017, AFI Docs 2017 and Sheffield Doc/Fest 2017.

When James was 17, a piano sonata that he composed was played at Carnegie Hall by his teacher, Leonard Shure.Town Topics (4 June 2014). \\"Obituary:James K.

He also taught for four years at the US Navy School of Music while on active duty. He joined the faculty of Princeton University in 1957. At Princeton, he became a pioneer in electronic music, working from the very early days of punch cards. Music from that time includes Lyric Variations for Violin and Computer, Quartets in Pairs, and Quartersines. Later, he did a great deal of free-wheeling improvisation, then late in life came back to composing for piano (the GAP series) and MIDI (a garland of Midi, My Prayer for Bella). Though Randall's music was mostly heard within the small world of academic music, it occasionally reached a wider audience, for instance on the radio show \\"Schickele Mix\\":Schickele, Peter: \\"Schickele Mix\\", episode #37, The Big Chill-Out.

It originates in the valleys of the cantons of the Grisons or Graubünden in the eastern part of the country, and of Ticino or Tessin in the south. It is possibly related to the grey type of the Passeirer Gebirgsziege from the Autonomous Province of Bolzano in north-eastern Italy. History Documentation of the Capra Grigia in the valleys of the Ticino and the Grisons goes back more than 100 years. Three regional types were distinguished: the Bleni-Valmaggia or Lavizzarer, the Liviner or Misoxer, and the Riveria. The breed was not recognised in the reorganisation of Swiss goat breeds in 1938, and infection with caprine arthritis encephalitis in the mid- twentieth century contributed to its near-total disappearance. The Swiss association ProSpecieRara launched a conservation and recovery project for the Capra Grigia in 1997, recorded all surviving members in a herd-book, and started a controlled breeding programme. Breed standards were formulated in 2005, and in 2006 the Capra Grigia was officially recognised as a Swiss breed. In 2007 the total number registered was 190, and the conservation status was listed by the FAO as \\"critical-maintained\\". In 2008, five apparently similar goats were discovered in the Valchiavenna in Italy, which increased the gene pool. In 2011 a breed association, Capra Grigia Schweiz, was formed. At the end of 2011 a population of 475–490 was reported to DAD-IS.  Characteristics  The Capra Grigia is sure-footed and agile, with hard hooves well-suited to the high mountain terrain of the southern Alps. The horns are strong, and grow upwards and outwards. The coat colour is similar to that of the Austrian : it varies from a mottled dark grey to a pale silver-white; the legs are dark grey or black, and there is a dark dorsal stripe.

She is believed to be the first woman to be licensed as a printer in the Thirteen Colonies. Nuthead was born in Anne Arundel County, Maryland. Her husband, William Nuthead, established the second colonial printing business in Jamestown, Virginia, in 1682. They moved to St. Mary's City, Maryland, in 1686 and established a press that primarily printed government forms. Following her husband's death in 1695, Nuthead appeared before the Prerogative Court and requested that she be appointed administrator of his estate. John Coode was one of the sureties in her bond. She inherited the press and took over the business. Within a year, the government moved to Annapolis, and Nuthead moved her press there as well. Nuthead petitioned the Maryland General Assembly on May 5, 1696, to grant her a license to print blank forms for the province's public offices as well as writs, bonds, bills, and warrants of attorney. The petition was read to the delegates eight days later. She was required to pay a security of £100 and was granted a license that allowed her to run the press. Nuthead was the first woman to run a printing press outside of Massachusetts and the first woman to be licensed as a printer in the colonies. Only five blank forms attributed to Nuthead's Annapolis press are extant. Many sources indicate that Nuthead was illiterate. She was apparently unable to sign her name, having been compelled to make her mark instead on a government document. Nuthead had two children by her first husband, William and Susannah. She remarried, to Manus Devoran (d. December 1700). Sometime after his death, she married Sebastian Oley of Annarund (d. 1707). She had her third child, Sebastian, with him.

He is credited with mortally wounding Croatian Ustaše leader Ante Pavelić. Biography Jovović was born in Kosić near Danilovgrad in today's Montenegro. During World War II he fought for the Yugoslav Army in the Fatherland, and was a member of the Bjelopavlić Chetnik brigade. At the time when World War II started, he was serving in Strumica, near the Yugoslav border with Greece. For his part in the April War he was honoured with a medal. When the war was over, he came back to his birthplace, Kosić in Bjelopavlići. As of July 1941 he took part in antifascist war against Italy. With Kosić's Partisan unit he participated in the battle of Pljevlja, and later commanded that unit. He later fought for the Chetniks, under the command of Bajo Stanišić. As of September 1944, he was part of the delegation led by Dušan Vlahović and Jakov Jovović, that was sent from Kotor across the Adriatic Sea to Taranto to negotiate with the British. There they were informed about Allied change of support in favor of Partisans as a result of the Tehran Conference and stayed in Italy throughout the remainder of the war. Jovović spent his time in Italy in several immigration camps. He was surrounded by the people tied to the intelligence service operations. On one such occasion, he met Randolph Churchill, of whom he reportedly did not hold a very high opinion. Tihomir-Tiho Burzanović, Knjiga o Blagoju Jovoviću - Dva metka za Pavelića. Attempted assassination of Ante Pavelić At that time, he found out that the Catholic Church had been hiding Ante Pavelić inside the Vatican under a false name. Jovović conceived the idea of finding and executing Pavelić due to the persecution and genocide of Serbs under his rule. Jovović was known as the founder of the Serbian Orthodox community “Saint Sava”, and one of the founders of the Organisation of Fighters “Draža Mihailović” as well as the member of the Board of the “Njegoš” association. While living in Argentina and running a successful hotel enterprise that he owned, he received tips about Pavelić's whereabouts in Argentina. Jakov Jovović began the assassination plans, but Blagoje himself agreed to carry them out. In this, they were joined by Milo Krivokapić. The assassination was scheduled to take place on April 9, 1957, on the eve of the Independent State of Croatia's anniversary celebration, but they decided to delay the attack by a day. On April 10, at 9 PM local time, 16 years after the founding of the Independent State of Croatia, Pavelić suspected someone was following him as he walked down a street, so he turned back and fired several shots towards Jovović, who started running after Pavelić and fired five shots, two of which hit Pavelić who then, according to Jovović, staggered, bent and begged for mercy. The assassination attempt is described in detail by Jovović in the following excerpt from the book “Two Bullets for Pavelić” („Два метка за Павелића”): Pavelić never fully recovered from the sustained injuries. He was also suffering from diabetes and he finally died on 28 December 1959 in Madrid, Spain. Later years In 1999, Jovović visited Yugoslavia for the first time fifty-five years after he had left and he visited Ostrog, where he met Metropolitan Amfilohije. There, he publicly confessed that he was the person responsible for the attempted assassination of Ante Pavelić. Death Jovović died on 2 June 1999 in Rosario, Argentina, just several months after visiting his birthplace. Legacy In 2020 it was decided that Blagoje Jovović will have a street, in Belgrade, named after him.https://www.danas.rs/beograd/blagoje-jovovic-dobija-ulicu-u-beogradu-a- djuza-stojiljkovic-spomen-plocu/ References Category:1922 births Category:1999 deaths Category:People from Danilovgrad Category:Serbs of Montenegro Category:Yugoslav assassins Category:Yugoslav emigrants to Argentina Category:Date of birth unknown ","title":"Blagoje Jovović"},{"id":"43129280","title":"Early Riser"},{"id":"43129326","title":"Nicolas Gob"},{"id":"43129335","text":"The Marching Virginians are one of two collegiate marching bands at Virginia Tech (the other being the Highty Tighties, the regimental band of the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets). Because the Marching Virginians draw from the general student body, they are considerably larger than the Highty Tighties and have about 330 members. Despite offering no scholarships to band members, The Marching Virginians consist of students from every college and virtually every major within the university, as well as several graduate students. History Known as \\"The Spirit of Tech\\" and established in 1974, the band performs at Virginia Tech football games, fundraisers, and charity events. The Marching Virginians also hold their own yearly charity event, Hokies for the Hungry, during which canned food is collected by band members prior to a Virginia Tech home football game to benefit the Montgomery County Christmas Store. The Marching Virginians are the creators of Virginia Tech's 'Stick It In' cheer, though the MVs were banned from performing this cheer by the Virginia Tech Athletics Department in Fall 2007. However, on October 19, 2019, the Marching Virginians performed 'Stick it In' during their home game against University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the first time the chant had been performed in Lane Stadium since the ban. Large venue performances The Marching Virginians have performed at the Orange Bowl, Peach Bowl, Independence Bowl, Sugar Bowl, Gator Bowl, Diamond Walnut San Francisco Bowl, and the 2004 BCA Classic, among many other venues. They were also recently featured on the Blacksburg edition of Extreme Makeover: Home Edition, as well as a 2007 ESPN Magazine article written by executive editor Steve Wulf. Current info The Marching Virginians are currently under the leadership of director Polly Middleton and assistant director Chad Reep. A majority of the music is arranged by Dr. James Sochinski, and the halftime performances are narrated by Mike Sparrer, \\"The Voice of the Marching Virginians.\\" The Marching Virginians are assisted by the Eta Beta Chapter of Kappa Kappa Psi and the Zeta Omicron Chapter of Tau Beta Sigma.  Traditions  The Marching Virginians perform at Lane Stadium before the Hokies' 2007 opener against the East Carolina Pirates The Marching Virginians, since their establishment in 1974, have developed a multitude of traditions and rituals: * For every home game, the Marching Virginians have a pre-game rehearsal (and are sometimes provided breakfast or lunch) before marching to Lane Stadium. Prior to the 2009 season, a small pep-parade from the south-end of the Cassell Coliseum parking lot, down Spring Road, to the south-west tunnel into Lane Stadium at Worsham Field took place. Due to the construction on McComas Hall during 2009, the band marched straight from their practice space at Johnson Track and Field across Spring Road to the tunnel at Worsham Field. The band continued its parade tradition midway through the 2010 season after the renovations completed. As of 2015, due to the construction of the Marching Virginians Center, the Marching Virginians have taken up a new tradition of marching down Chicken Hill lot toward Lane Stadium, cheering with the tailgaters as they march. *Previously, two \\"Renegade\\" Pep Bands roamed the parking lots surrounding the stadium playing for fans before either meeting back up with the rest of the band before a pre-game performance or playing \\"call-and- answer\\" style with the main band (east stands) and the other renegade band (other corner of west stands)) * Each section independently develops its own cheers, calls, dances, and chants, sometimes involving inter-sectional cooperation (such as the clarinet/saxophone sections' combined \\"STROKE-OH!\\" chant). These chants often begin with a section leader or rank captain calling a command, usually ending in something along the lines of \\"TWEET-TWEET-HO\\" to simulate a whistle command. * The MVs were the original creators of the \\"Stick It In\\" cheer, which became one of the most popular cheers of Virginia Tech football before its discontinuance in 2007 by the VT athletic department. The cheer was played multiple times during the 6 overtime game against UNC in 2019, but it is unclear if it will return permanently * Entering Lane Stadium, each band member falls out of rank, touches his/her hand to the Hokie Stone at the entrance to the field, and falls back into their position in the parade block. * Far less formal than the Highty-Tighties, the Marching Virginians are allowed to wear their Marching Virginians baseball cap given to them at the beginning of the season (or their MVs ski cap for colder weather). Other forms of personal flair which do not interfere with or deface their uniforms, such as sunglasses, keychains, or temporary facial tattoos, are frequent among band members. Drum major prepares to conduct The Marching Virginians prior to the 2010 ACC Championship Game. * In the stands, sections will often choreograph their own dances and horn movements to different songs and drum breaks, giving the sections more individual freedom with their stand music. * In every fieldshow, the MVs usually perform one to three songs followed by \\"Tech Triumph\\" as they march off the field. * Until the 2017 season, the tuba section led Lane Stadium in the MVs' signature rendition of the Hokie Pokie between the 3rd and 4th quarters of each home football game.http://www.hokiesports.com/football/recaps/20170823aab.html Music The MVs play the following pieces in the stands on a regular basis, as well as many other favorites. *Tech Triumph *VPI Victory March *Carry Me Back to Old Virginny \\"Carry Me Back\\" (Prior to 2020) *Oh Shenandoah \\"Shenandoah\\" (Replaced \\"Carry Me Back\\" in 2020) *Scatman (Ski Ba Bop Ba Dop Bop) \\"Scatman\\" *Carry On Wayward Son *Radar Love *Rock This Town *Jungle Boogie *Theme From Superman And of course: The Hokey Pokey, known as \\"Hokie Pokie\\" in Blacksburg.

He is a composer and MC in the group Hocus Pocus, member of beatmaker collective of DJs C2C, one half of the Hip Hop/Electronic duo AllttA and quadruple world champion DMC Team. He published his first EP, Motifs, in 2014, followed by Motifs II in 2015. During his career, he also produced for artists and groups such as Diam's, Disiz, Kohndo, Slum Village, Fabe, Scred Connexion, Nakk, Sully Sefil, and is involved in projects such as Just Us vol.1 or Original Bombattak.  Biography  Richard, originally a graphic designer, graduated from the Graduate School of Fine Arts in Nantes Métropole. He began his musical career in his bedroom at his parents' house in Rezé. In 1995, Richard and Cambia released their first mixtape, Première Formule. Recorded in a makeshift studio, the first self-produced cassette was sold in the courtyard of their school. In 1997, they associated with DJ Greem, a high school friend of Richard's, to form the group Hocus Pocus, and released their first album as a trio, Seconde Formule, in 1998. Hocus Pocus mixes elements specific to hip- hop (scratches, samples, rap) to an instrumental sound influenced by jazz, soul and funk. Alongside Hocus Pocus, they created in collaboration with DJ Atom and DJ Pfel, a group called C2C (Coups2Cross). C2C was the world champion DMC team four years in a row from 2003 to 2006. They found the collaboration of two MCs and a DJ did not work on stage and went their separate ways; Richard continued his production as 20syl and DJ Greem invested specifically in C2C. In 2001, Richard worked again with DJ Greem and Cambia on stage as Hocus Pocus. The same year, they created the label On & On and released the maxi Sick, which sold around 4000 copies. Three years later, they released the album 73 Touches (in reference to the number of piano keys). Largely influenced by jazz, they refer to Miles Davis and Billie Holiday. Mathieu Lelièvre on keyboard, Hervé Godard on bass and David Le Deunff on guitar complement the trio. The same album was reissued in 2006 with a new version of Sick and six new titles. 20syl performing with DJ Greem in 2008 The album Place 54, released in October 2007, increased their willingness to create acoustic hip-hop. For this album, they signed with the label Motown France to promote and distribute it. The album was well received and attracted interest from mainstream TV and radio. In 2008, Hocus Pocus was nominated for a Victoires de la Musique award in the category \\"Urban Music Album of the Year\\". Richard published his first solo EP, Motifs, on the 9 June 2014; the site sourdoreille.net considers this EP as \\"a real gem\\" whilst wordplaymagazine.com praises Richard's style as \\"frankly remarkable\\". His second EP, Motifs II, was published on 11 May 2015. Regarding the cover of Motifs II Richard explains: \\"For the first volume, I played on the contrast between the zebra and the checkerboard. For this one, I wanted another animal. I like animals with a solemn air, which release an aesthetic force. When I came across this owl, I found him mysterious and chic.

A historic free-standing bell tower still stands at the site, now at the intersection of Main and 4th Cross Streets. History Watercolour of Kayman's Gate by J. L. K. van Dort (1888) The second Colombo Fort was constructed by the Portuguese in 1554 as a fortification of their trading post at Colombo, and captured by the Dutch in 1656. Under the Portuguese, the fort's principal entrance at the eastern rampart was Poorta Reinha (\\"Queen's Gate\\"), a large tunnel guarded by drawbridge and moat. \\"Kayman's Gate\\" comes from the Dutch word Kaaiman, crocodile. During that period, Mugger crocodiles were found in large numbers in the Beira Lake, and would congregate in the moat to eat rubbish thrown out by the city dwellers within the fort. The south-north canal linking Beira Lake to the sea via the moat was later named St. John’s River, and then, after being filled in during the British occupation, St John Street. Konings Straat (literally \\"King's Street\\"; originally the Portuguese Roa Directo, and now Main Street), linked the old city of Pettah with the fort, and terminated at Kayman’s Gate. By 1870, the fort and its structures were almost completely demolished. Until the late 19th century, colonial rulers used the site of Kayman's Gate for public hangings. The Kayman's Gate bell purportedly dates back to the 16th Century, where it originally hung in a Portuguese Church dedicated to Saint Francis in the Royal City of Kotte. Although Kotte was abandoned in 1565, the Dutch later reoccupied it and found a bell amidst the ruins of the church. This bell was relocated to a newly-constructed bell tower at Kayman’s Gate, where it was used as a curfew bell ‘to mark the closing of the Castle’s gates and lights out’. Following the demolition of the fort's walls, the bell was used to summon the worshippers to prayer and praise at the Wolvendaal Church, with the bell tower becoming part of the church's property. Kayman's Gate is referenced in the song Paru Palamen, written by Sunil Edirisinghe.

Wound healing is an innate mechanism of action that works reliably most of the time. A key feature of wound healing is stepwise repair of lost extracellular matrix (ECM) that forms the largest component of the dermal skin layer. But in some cases, certain disorders or physiological insult disturbs the wound healing process. Diabetes mellitus is one such metabolic disorder that impedes the normal steps of the wound healing process. Many studies show a prolonged inflammatory phase in diabetic wounds, which causes a delay in the formation of mature granulation tissue and a parallel reduction in wound tensile strength. Treatment of diabetic foot ulcers should include: blood sugar control, removal of dead tissue from the wound, wound dressings, and removing pressure from the wound through techniques such as total contact casting. Surgery in some cases may improve outcomes. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy may also help but is expensive. It occurs in 15% of people with diabetes, and precedes 84% of all diabetes- related lower-leg amputations.  Risk factors  Risk factors implicated in the development of diabetic foot ulcers are infection, older age, diabetic neuropathy, peripheral vascular disease, cigarette smoking, poor glycemic control, previous foot ulcerations or amputations, and ischemia of small and large blood vessels. Prior history of foot disease, foot deformities that produce abnormally high forces of pressure, callus at pressure areas renal failure, oedema, impaired ability to look after personal care (e.g. visual impairment) are further risk factors for diabetic foot ulcer. People with diabetes often develop diabetic neuropathy due to several metabolic and neurovascular factors. Peripheral neuropathy causes loss of pain or feeling in the toes, feet, legs and arms due to distal nerve damage and low blood flow. Blisters and sores appear on numb areas of the feet and legs such as metatarso-phalangeal joints, heel region and as a result pressure or injury goes unnoticed and eventually become portal of entry for bacteria and infection.  Pathophysiology  = Extracellular matrix = Extra cellular matrix (or \\"ECM\\") is the external structural framework that cells attach to in multicellular organisms. The dermis lies below the epidermis, and these two layers are collectively known as the skin. Dermal skin is primarily a combination of fibroblasts growing in this matrix. The specific species of ECM of connective tissues often differ chemically, but collagen generally forms the bulk of the structure. Through the interaction of cell with its extracellular matrix (transmitted through the anchoring molecules classed as integrins) there forms a continuous association between cell interior, cell membrane and extracellular matrix components that help drive various cellular events in a regulated fashion. Wound healing is a localized event involving the reaction of cells to the damage sustained. The cells break down damaged ECM and replace it, generally increasing in number to react to the harm. The process is activated, though perhaps not exclusively, by cells responding to fragments of damaged ECM, and the repairs are made by reassembling the matrix by cells growing on and through it. Because of this extracellular matrix is often considered as a 'conductor of the wound healing symphony'. In the Inflammatory phase, neutrophils and macrophages recruit and activate fibroblasts which in subsequent granulation phase migrate into the wound, laying down new collagen of the subtypes I and III. In the initial events of wound healing, collagen III predominates in the granulation tissue which later on in remodeling phase gets replaced by collagen I giving additional tensile strength to the healing tissue. It is evident from the known collagen assembly that the tensile strength is basically due to fibrillar arrangement of collagen molecules, which self-assemble into microfibrils in a longitudinal as well as lateral manner producing extra strength and stability to the collagen assembly. Metabolically altered collagen is known to be highly inflexible and prone to break down, particularly over pressure areas. Fibronectin is the major glycoprotein secreted by fibroblasts during initial synthesis of extracellular matrix proteins. It serves important functions, being a chemo- attractant for macrophages, fibroblasts and endothelial cells. Basement membrane that separates epidermis from the dermal layer and endothelial basement membrane mainly contain collagen IV that forms a sheet and binds to other extra cellular matrix molecules like laminin and proteoglycans. In addition to collagen IV, epidermal and endothelial basement membrane also contain laminin, perlecan and nidogen. Hyaluronic acid, a pure glycosaminoglycan component is found in high amounts in damaged or growing tissues. It stimulates cytokine production by macrophages and thus promotes angiogenesis. In normal skin chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan is mainly found in the basement membrane but in healing wounds they are up regulated throughout the granulation tissue especially during second week of wound repair, when they provide a temporary matrix with highly hydrative capacity. Binding of growth factors is clearly an important role of perlecan in wound healing and angiogenesis. Poor wound healing in diabetes mellitus may be related to perlecan expression. High levels of glucose can decrease perlecan expression in some cells probably through transcriptional and post- transcriptional modification. Wound healing phases especially, granulation, re-epithelization and remodelling exhibit controlled turnover of extracellular matrix components. =Altered metabolism= Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder and hence the defects observed in diabetic wound healing are thought to be the result of altered protein and lipid metabolism and thereby abnormal granulation tissue formation. Increased glucose levels in the body end up in uncontrolled covalent bonding of aldose sugars to a protein or lipid without any normal glycosylation enzymes. These stable products then accumulate over the surface of cell membranes, structural proteins and circulating proteins. These products are called advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) or Amadori products. Formation of AGEs occurs on extracellular matrix proteins with slow turnover rate. AGEs alter the properties of matrix proteins such as collagen, vitronectin, and laminin through AGE-AGE intermolecular covalent bonds or cross-linking. AGE cross-linking on type I collagen and elastin results in increased stiffness. AGEs are also known to increase synthesis of type III collagen that forms the granulation tissue. AGEs on laminin result in reduced binding to type IV collagen in the basement membrane, reduced polymer elongation and reduced binding of heparan sulfate proteoglycan. ;Impaired NO synthesis :Nitric oxide is known as an important stimulator of cell proliferation, maturation and differentiation. Thus, nitric oxide increases fibroblast proliferation and thereby collagen production in wound healing. Also, L-arginine and nitric oxide are required for proper cross linking of collagen fibers, via proline, to minimize scarring and maximize the tensile strength of healed tissue. Endothelial cell specific nitric oxide synthase (EcNOS) is activated by the pulsatile flow of blood through vessels. Nitric oxide produced by EcNOS, maintains the diameter of blood vessels and proper blood flow to tissues. In addition to this, nitric oxide also regulates angiogenesis, which plays a major role in wound healing. Thus, diabetic patients exhibit reduced ability to generate nitric oxide from L-arginine. Reasons that have been postulated in the literature include accumulation of nitric oxide synthase inhibitor due to high glucose associated kidney dysfunction and reduced production of nitric oxide synthase due to ketoacidosis observed in diabetic patients and pH dependent nature of nitric oxide synthase. ;Structural and functional changes in fibroblasts :Diabetic ulcer fibroblasts show various morphological differences compared to fibroblasts from age matched controls. Diabetic ulcer fibroblasts are usually large and widely spread in the culture flask compared to the spindle shaped morphology of the fibroblasts in age-matched controls. They often show dilated endoplasmic reticulum, numerous vesicular bodies and lack of microtubular structure in transmission electron microscopy study. Therefore, interpretation of these observations would be that in spite of high protein production and protein turnover in diabetic ulcer fibroblasts, vesicles containing secretory proteins could not travel along the microtubules to release the products outside. Fibroblasts from diabetic ulcer exhibit proliferative impairment that probably contributes to a decreased production of extracellular matrix proteins and delayed wound contraction and impaired wound healing. ;Increased matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) activity :In order for a wound to heal, extracellular matrix not only needs to be laid down but also must be able to undergo degradation and remodeling to form a mature tissue with appropriate tensile strength. Proteases, namely matrix metalloproteinases are known to degrade almost all the extracellular matrix components. They are known to be involved in fibroblast and keratinocyte migration, tissue re-organization, inflammation and remodeling of the wounded tissue. Due to persistently high concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines in diabetic ulcers, MMP activity is known to increase by 30 fold when compared to acute wound healing. MMP-2 and MMP-9 show sustained overexpression in chronic non-healing diabetic ulcers. Balance in the MMP activity is usually achieved by tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP). Rather than absolute concentrations of either two, it is the ratio of MMP and TIMP that maintains the proteolytic balance and this ratio is found to be disturbed in diabetic ulcer. In spite of these findings, the exact mechanism responsible for increased MMP activity in diabetes is not known yet. One possible line of thought considers Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) as an active player. Most MMP genes have TGF-β inhibitory element in their promoter regions and thus TGF–β regulates the expression of both MMP and their inhibitor TIMP. In addition to the importance of cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, all phases of wound healing are controlled by a wide variety of different growth factors and cytokines. To mention precisely, growth factors promote switching of early inflammatory phase to the granulation tissue formation. Decrease in growth factors responsible for tissue repair such as TGF-β is documented in diabetic wounds. Thus, reduced levels of TGFβ in diabetes cases lower down the effect of inhibitory regulatory effect on MMP genes and thus cause MMPs to over express. =Biomechanics= Complications in the diabetic foot and foot-ankle complex are wider and more destructive than expected, and may compromise structure and function of several systems: vascular, nervous, somatosensory, musculoskeletal. Thus, a deeper comprehension of the alteration of gait and foot biomechanics in the diabetic foot is of great interest, and may play a role in the design and onset of preventive as well as therapeutic actions. Briefly, the effect of diabetes on the main structures of the foot-ankle complex can be summarised as: * effects on skin: skin – and the soft tissues immediately underneath the skin – undergo greater compression and shear loading than usual, thus explaining the onset of tissue damage so deeply correlated to traumatic ulceration processes. Besides this, skin of the diabetic foot suffers from loss of autonomic nervous control and consequently reduced hydration, making it less elastic and thus more vulnerable to the action of increased mechanical stress; * effects on tendons and ligaments: protein glycosylation and the resulting collagen abnormalities lead to greater transversal section – i.e. thickening – of tendons and ligaments and a greater coefficient of elasticity. Particularly impacted by this process are Plantar Fascia and Achilles Tendon. Both causes lead to an increased stiffness of those structures; * effects on cartilage: similar to what happens to tendons and ligaments, cartilage changes its composition mainly due to the modification of collagen fibers. This increases its stiffness and decreases the range of motion of all joints in the foot and ankle. * effects on muscles: Diabetes mellitus causes severe damage to nerve conduction, thus causing a worsening in the management of the related muscle fibers. As a consequence, both intrinsic and extrinsic muscles of the foot-ankle complex are damaged in structure (reduction of muscle volume) and function (reduction of muscle strength); * effects on peripheral sensory system: impaired nerve conduction has a dramatic effect on the peripheral sensory system, since it leads to loss of protective sensation under the sole of the foot. This exposes the diabetic foot to thermal or mechanical trauma, and to the late detection of infection processes or tissue breakdown; * effects on foot morphology (deformities): due to most of the above alterations, a significant imbalance of peripheral musculature and soft tissue occur in the foot which seriously alters its morphology and determines the onset of foot deformities. Most common deformities of the diabetic foot are represented by a high longitudinal arch (rigid cavus foot), hammer toes and hallux valgus. A completely different morphologic degeneration is represented by neuropathic arthropathy, whose analysis is not part of this discussion.  Diagnosis  Assessment of diabetic foot ulcer includes identifying risk factors such as diabetic peripheral neuropathy, noting that 50 percent of people are asymptomatic, and ruling out other causes of peripheral neuropathy such as alcohol abuse and spinal injury. The location of the ulcer, its size, shape, depth and whether the tissue is granulating or sloughy needs to be considered. Further considerations include whether there is malodour, condition of the border of the wound and palpable bone and sinus formation should be investigated. Signs of infection require to be considered such as development of grey or yellow tissue, purulent discharge, unpleasant smell, sinus, undermined edges and exposure of bone or tendon. Identification of diabetic foot in medical databases, such as commercial claims and prescription data, is complicated by the lack of a specific ICD-9 code for diabetic foot and variation in coding practices. The following codes indicate ulcer of the lower limb or foot: * 707.1 Ulcer of lower limbs, except pressure ulcer * 707.14 Ulcer of heel and midfoot * 707.15 Ulcer of other part of foot * 707.19 Ulcer of other part of lower limb One or more codes, in combination with a current or prior diagnosis of diabetes may be sufficient to conclude diabetic foot: * 250.0 Diabetes Mellitus * 250.8 Diabetes with other specified manifestations =Classification = Diabetic foot ulcer is a complication of diabetes. Diabetic foot ulcers are classified as either neuropathic, neuroischaemic or ischaemic. Doctors also use the Wagner Grades to describe the severity of an ulcer. The purpose of the Wagner Grades is to allow specialists to better monitor and treat diabetic foot ulcers. This grading system classifies Diabetic foot ulcers using numbers, from 0 to 5. Wagner Grades 0 through 5 are as follows: * 0. No diabetic foot ulcer is present, but there is a high risk of developing one. * 1. A surface ulcer involves full skin thickness, but does not yet involve the underlying tissues. * 2. A deep ulcer penetrates past the surface, down to the ligaments and muscle. There is no abscess or bone involved yet. * 3. A deep ulcer occurs with inflammation of subcutaneous connective tissue or an abscess. This can include infections in the muscle, tendon, joint, and/or bone. * 4. The tissue around the area of the ulcer (limited to the toes and forefoot) has begun to decay. This is condition is called gangrene. * 5. Gangrene has spread from the localized area of the ulcer to become extensive. This involves the whole foot. Prevention Steps to prevent diabetic foot ulcers include frequent review by a foot specialist and multidisciplinary team, good foot hygiene, diabetic socks and shoes, as well as avoiding injury. Foot-care education combined with increased surveillance can reduce the incidence of serious foot lesions. There is no high quality researches that evaluate complex intervention of combining two or more preventive strategies in preventing diabetic foot ulcer. =Footwear= The evidence for special footwear to prevent foot ulcers is poor. Clinical Evidence reviewed the topic and concluded \\"Individuals with significant foot deformities should be considered for referral and assessment for customised shoes that can accommodate the altered foot anatomy. In the absence of significant deformities, high quality well fitting non-prescription footwear seems to be a reasonable option\\". National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence concluded that for people at \\"high risk of foot ulcers (neuropathy or absent pulses plus deformity or skin changes or previous ulcer\\" that \\"specialist footwear and insoles\\" should be provided. People with loss of feeling in their feet should inspect their feet on a daily basis, to ensure that there are no wounds starting to develop. They should not walk around barefoot, but use proper footwear at all times.  Treatment  Foot ulcers in diabetes require multidisciplinary assessment, usually by diabetes nurse specialist, a tissue viability nurse, podiatrists, diabetes specialists and surgeons. An aim to improve glycaemic control, if poor, forms part of the management, to slow disease progression. Individuals who have sausage shaped toes, a positive 'probe to bone' test, evidence suggesting osteomyelitis, suspected charcot neuroarthropathy, or those whose ulcers do not improve within 4 weeks of standard care and where there is evidence that exudate is of synovial membrane in origin. When osteomyelitis is suspected to be involved in the foot ulcer, but not evidenced on an x-ray, an MRI scan should be obtained. With regards to infected foot ulcers, the presence of microorganisms is not in itself enough to determine whether an infection is present. Signs such as inflammation and purulence are the best indicators of an active infection. The most common organism causing infection is staphylococcus. The treatment consists of debridement, appropriate bandages, managing peripheral arterial disease and appropriate use of antibiotics (against pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus, streptococcus and anaerobe strains), and arterial revascularisation. =Antibiotics= The length of antibiotic courses depend on the severity of the infection and whether bone infection is involved but can range from 1 week to 6 weeks or more. Current recommendations are that antibiotics are only used when there is evidence of infection and continued until there is evidence that the infection has cleared, instead of evidence of ulcer healing. Choice of antibiotic depends on common local bacterial strains known to infect ulcers. Microbiological swabs are believed to be of limited value in identifying causative strain. Microbiological investigation is of value in cases of osteomyelitis. Most ulcer infections involve multiple microorganisms. There is limited safety and efficacy data of topical antibiotics in treating diabetic foot ulcers. =Wound dressings= There are many types of dressings used to treat diabetic foot ulcers such as absorptive fillers, hydrogel dressings, and hydrocolloids. There is no good evidence that one type of dressing is better than another for diabetic foot ulcers. In selecting dressings for chronic non healing wounds it is recommended that the cost of the product be taken into account. Hydrogel dressings may have shown a slight advantage over standard dressings, but the quality of the research is of concern. Dressings and creams containing silver have not been properly studied nor have alginate dressings. Biologically active bandages that combine hydrogel and hydrocolloid traits are available, however more research needs to be conducted as to the efficacy of this option over others. =Total contact casting= Total contact casting (TCC) is a specially designed cast designed to take weight of the foot (off-loading) in patients with DFUs. Reducing pressure on the wound by taking weight of the foot has proven to be very effective in DFU treatment. DFUs are a major factor leading to lower leg amputations among the diabetic population in the US with 85% of amputations in diabetics being preceded by a DFU. Furthermore, the 5 year post-amputation mortality rate among diabetics is estimated at around 45% for those suffering from neuropathic DFUs. TCC has been used for off-loading DFUs in the US since the mid-1960s and is regarded by many practitioners as the “reference standard” for off-loading the bottom surface (sole) of the foot. TCC helps patients to maintain their quality of life. By encasing the patient’s complete foot — including the toes and lower leg — in a specialist cast to redistribute weight and pressure from the foot to the lower leg during everyday movements, patients can remain mobile. The manner in which TCC redistributes pressure protects the wound, letting damaged tissue regenerate and heal. TCC also keeps the ankle from rotating during walking, which helps prevent shearing and twisting forces that can further damage the wound. Effective off loading is a key treatment modality for DFUs, particularly those where there is damage to the nerves in the feet (peripheral neuropathy). Along with infection management and vascular assessment, TCC is vital aspect to effectively managing DFUs. TCC is the most effective and reliable method for off-loading DFUs. A 2013 meta-analysis by the Cochrane Collaboration compared the effectiveness of non-removable pressure relieving interventions, such as casts, with therapeutic shoes, dressings, removable pressure relieving orthotic devices, and surgical interventions. Non-removable pressure relieving interventions, including non-removable casts with an Achilles tendon lengthening component, were found to be more effective at healing foot ulcers related to diabetes that therapeutic shoes and other pressure relieving approaches. =Hyperbaric oxygen= In 2015, a Cochrane review concluded that for people with diabetic foot ulcers, hyperbaric oxygen therapy reduced the risk of amputation and may improve the healing at 6 weeks. However, there was no benefit at one year and the quality of the reviewed trials was inadequate to draw strong conclusions. =Negative pressure wound therapy= This treatment uses vacuum to remove excess fluid and cellular waste that usually prolong the inflammatory phase of wound healing. Despite a straightforward mechanism of action, results of negative pressure wound therapy studies have been inconsistent. Research needs to be carried out to optimize the parameters of pressure intensity, treatment intervals and exact timing to start negative pressure therapy in the course of chronic wound healing. There is low- certainty evidence that negative pressure wound therapy would improve wound healing in diabetic foot ulcers. = Other treatments = Ozone therapy – there is only limited and poor-quality information available regarding the effectiveness of ozone therapy for treating foot ulcers in people with diabetes. Growth factors - there is some low-quality evidence that growth factors may increase the likelihood that diabetic foot ulcers will heal completely. Continuous diffusion of oxygen (CDO) - CDO delivers continuous oxygen to an occluded, moist wound site at much lower flow rates of 3–12 mL/h for 24 h 7 days a week for up to several weeks or months, depending on the wound status. Phototherapy - there is very weak evidence to suggest that people with foot ulcers due to diabetes may have improved healing. There is no evidence to suggest that phototherapy improves the quality of life for people with foot ulcers caused by diabetes. Sucrose-octasulfate impregnated dressing is recommended by the International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot Ulcer (IWGDF) for the treatment of non-infected, neuro-ischaemic diabetic foot ulcers that do not show an improvement with a standard of care regimen Autologous combined leucocyte, platelet and fibrin as an adjunctive treatment, in addition to best standard of care is also recommended by IWGDF However, there is only low quality evidence that such treatment is effective in treating diabetic foot ulcer. There is limited evidence that granulocyte colony-stimulating factor may not hasten the resolution of diabetic foot ulcer infection. However, it may reduce the need for surgical interventions such as amputations and hospitalizations. It is unknown that whether intensive or conventional blood glucose control is better for diabetic foot ulcer healing. A 2020 Cochrane systematic review evaluated the effects of nutritional supplements or special diets on healing foot ulcers in people with diabetes. The review authors concluded that it's uncertain whether or not nutritional interventions have an effect on foot ulcer healing and that more research is needed to answer this question. Skin grafting and tissue replacements can help to improve the healing of diabetic foot ulcer. Epidemiology Approximately 15 percent of people with diabetes experience foot ulcers, and approximately 84 percent of lower limb amputations have a history of ulceration with only approximately half of amputees surviving for more than 2 years. 56 percent of individuals with foot ulcers who do not have an amputations survive for 5 years. Foot ulcers and amputations significantly reduce the quality of life. Approximately 8.8 percent of hospital admissions of diabetic patients are for foot related problems, and such hospital admissions are about 13 days longer than for diabetics without foot related admissions. Approximately 35 to 40 percent of ulcers recur within 3 years and up to 70 percent recur within 5 years. Diabetic foot disease is the leading cause of non-traumatic lower limb amputations. Research Stem cell therapy may represent a treatment for promoting healing of diabetic foot ulcers. Diabetic foot ulcers develop their own, distinctive microbiota. Investigations into characterizing and identifying the phyla, genera and species of nonpathogenic bacteria or other microorganisms populating these ulcers may help identify one group of microbiota that promotes healing. The recent advances in epigenetic modifications, with special focus on aberrant macrophage polarisation is giving increasing evidences that epigenetic modifications might play a vital role in changing the treatment of diabetic foot ulcer in the near future.

History Florent was located at 69 Gansevoort Street, one of the few remaining cobblestone streets in New York City. In 1985 Florent Morellet took over the R&L; Restaurant, which had opened in 1943, and renamed it Florent. The following January, a reporter for New York magazine referred to it as \\"New York's hottest downtown eating spot\\". Florent was a hub of gay New York. Morellet was diagnosed HIV-positive in 1987 and used to post his T-cell count on the restaurant's wall menu along with the daily specials. It attracted a highly eclectic clientele. It was also known for its Bastille Day celebrations, which started in 1989, the year of the French bicentennial. Other major annual celebrations were Halloween, New Year’s Eve, and Oscar Night. Morellet campaigned for the preservation of the neighborhood and became known as \\"Unofficial Mayor of the Meatpacking District\\"; he preferred \\"Unofficial Queen\\". The graphic design for the restaurant was designed by Tibor Kalman and Douglas Riccardi from M&Co;, in exchange for free meals; examples are now in the MoMA design collection. Florent Morellet, the eponymous owner of the restaurant, is the youngest son of French conceptual artist, Francois Morellet. Erica De Mane, the food journalist and cookbook writer, began her cooking career at Florent in 1985. Florent closed on June 29, 2008, after the landlord raised the rent considerably. In the last weeks, Morellet held five parties themed after the stages of grief. Films In May 2011, Magic Lantern released Florent: Queen of the Meat Market, a documentary history of the restaurant directed by David Sigal. , Alan Cumming is planning to co-produce with Sigal and star in a Showtime biography of Morellet focusing on Florent.

Born in Córdoba, Argentina, Bergoglio studied at the Taller de Pintura de María Finochietti in Argentina from 1983 to 1986, and received her Titulación Superior (higher qualifications) in urban architecture from the National University of Córdoba in 1996. Her first exhibitions were in the late 1980s. In 1997, she moved to Spain, where she attended the Taller de Pintura Emma Gans in Madrid, and the Taller del Prado academy in Madrid, later becoming a teacher at that institution, until 2007. Her paintings tend to portray large metropolises such as New York City, Miami, Porto, London, and Madrid, and she usually works with acrylic and oil painting techniques. In June, 2014, her works were displayed in an exhibit at the Conrad Hotel in the Brickell neighborhood of Miami. In 2017, she was one of twenty artists with works featured in a charitable exhibit and auction at the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum, and in 2018, her works were shown at the Doorway Gallery in Dublin, Ireland. Her showing in Dublin, including paintings of the city that she had prepared for the occasion, coincided with a visit to Ireland by Pope Francis, though the gallery exhibition was planned a year before the Pope's visit was announced. In 2019, Bergoglio was the subject of a documentary short, Escribir con el pincel (Write with the brush) screened at the Academy of Cinematographic Arts and Sciences of Spain. In 2020, she was one of eleven artists to be included in an exhibition titled \\"Once de 10\\" at Espacio 36 in Zamora, Spain. As of 2020, Bergoglio resides in Spain. In her personal life, she has described herself as spiritual but not religious, and has stated, \\"I'm not afraid to say I see the church as outdated, and that's why I believe life has put my uncle to renew this certain system of thought that was getting stagnated\\". In one interview, she indicated that she has only met Pope Francis once, where she \\"gifted him with a painting of the city of Assisi in Italy\\", and that she had not sought to meet him again out of \\"respect [for] his job as a spiritual messenger\\", and due to her own busy schedule. In addition to painting and teaching, she has written pieces for several magazines, and published several books, Vivir Renaciendo (Live Reborn)., The 20 Freedoms of Being, Entrar en lo Extraordinario en tiempos del corona (Enter the extraordinary in crown times), and y Que la ciudad sea contigo (May the city be with you).

Lott (July 15, 1920 – August 12, 1993), best known as Jack Lott, was a big game hunter, writer, historian, and inventor of the .458 Lott, a renowned .458 caliber belted hunting cartridge. He was a biographer of Frederick Russell Burnham and a frequent contributor on gun topics. Early life Born in Maryland, Jack Lott was named after his uncle, Pessou Jacques Lott. He was of Scottish, English and German descent and several of his ancestors served as Confederate States Army officers in the American Civil War. In his early youth, his family moved to California and he graduated Beverly Hills High School and Los Angeles City College. He developed an early interest in military history, big game, and guns, and learned to make his own gun barrels on a lathe.  Gunsmith and writer  Lott was a trained machinist and a tool-and-die man who worked for Pachmayr in the 1960s. He used this training to specialize in very high-grade firearms, particularly Mauser rifles and English double rifles. He was also an expert at stockmaking, combining English and American styles into his bolt-action rifles stocks. He was knowledgeable in all aspects of firearms lore, and he applied this knowledge in his writing. In addition to writing several biographies of Frederick Russell Burnham, in his personal collection he owned several of Burnham's guns. Lott was a 35-year veteran of African hunts, specializing in Cape buffalo, and he hunted in Sumatra and Thailand on occasion. His expertise in hunting and gunsmithing combined to make him one of primary authorities on rifles and loads for dangerous game. While he is best known for the .458 Lott cartridge, he also helped Tom Siatos in the invention of the .460 G&A; and several other heavy-caliber rifle cartridges for big game hunting. According to his colleague Craig Boddington, a fellow writer on gun topics: \\"Legend has it that he worked for the CIA. We never knew that for sure, but I know he was with the anti-castro movement and he spent a lot of time in Rhodesia during the long bush war. With Jack one never knew where fact, legend and myth intertwined – but I actually saw his Congo Cross awarded to him by Moise Tshombe for his courage in that long forgotten insurgency.\\" = The .458 Lott Cartridge = Lott had an adverse encounter in Mozambique in 1959 with an African Cape buffalo in which he sustained injuries. He had been hunting with the then new .458 Winchester Magnum. This experience convinced him that a more powerful cartridge than the .458 Winchester Magnum was required when hunting dangerous game. After the encounter he began a search for a big bore cartridge which would suit his needs perfectly. Not finding a cartridge that would fit his needs, he designed a cartridge which he felt would meet his requirements in a dangerous game cartridge. Jack Lott's original drawings of the cartridge were done on a napkin at a diner. The first cases for the new rifle cartridge were fireformed from .375 H&H; Magnum brass into a chamber by using .458 caliber (11.6 mm) bullets which had their bases re-sized so as to fit in the mouth of the .375 H&H; Magnum. This method of fireforming left the newly formed cases slightly shorter than the parent cases. The resulting cartridge is named the .458 Lott in his honor. A similar method was used by David Miller and Curt Crum to create cases for their early custom .458 Lott rifles. The creation of the cases began with the casting of a bullet with a shank and which weighed around 260 gr. This bullet was seated on a .375 H&H; Magnum case containing of Hercules 2400 powder with some polyester material used as a wadding to hold the powder charge against the primer. This set-up was then fire-formed in rifle with a .458 Lott chamber. The fire-formed cases were then run through a .458 Winchester Magnum full length re-sizing die with a set off of . Once this was accomplished cases were trimmed to tumbled clean. This method of fire-forming of brass led to severe gas cutting into the neck area of the .458 Lott fire-forming rifle after only 200 rounds. In 1989 A-Square became the first company to offer the .458 Lott as a commercial cartridge. Illness and suicide In 1992, Lott suffered failure in both kidneys due in part to his alcoholism and diabetes. He began to lose his sight and needed dialysis twice a week. He used a .455 Webley revolver to take his own life with a shot to his head.

Today most tribal members live in Mackinac, Emmet, Cheboygan, and Presque Isle counties. The tribe is headquartered in St. Ignace, Mackinac County. History The Mackinac Bands of Chippewa and Ottawa Indians are descendants of Anishinaabe people who migrated from somewhere in the Northeast to the Great Lakes area (now known as Michigan) sometime around 1200 CE. Later some of the bands became centered in territories to the south and west of the lakes. The Odawa, Ojibwa, and Potawatomi people were closely related and affiliated as the Council of Three Fires. The Mackinac Bands of these three peoples is one of the oldest and largest historical groups in Michigan. It occupied territory around Mackinac and traded with French colonists at their post set up at St. Ignace, in what later became Michigan, United States. The Mackinac Bands occupied territory around Mackinac Bay. They later also traded with British and United States traders, after the border was changed and as a result of wars among those powers. The Mackinac Bands of Odawa, Ojibwa and Potawatomi comprises Units 11 through 17 of the former Northern Michigan Ottawa Association, a confederation formed in 1948 to politically address the needs of the Anishinaabe peoples in Michigan. Since that time several bands have gained federal recognition, sometimes through legislation. The Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians was federally recognized in 1972. In 1979 its Tribal Council passed a resolution to accept the Mackinac Bands as members, and nearly doubled its enrollment as a result. The people who are members of the Mackinac Bands of Chippewa and Ottawa Indians withdrew to pursue federal recognition independently. The Mackinac Bands have interests and issues in common outside the Sault tribe, and they have been petitioning for federal recognition since 1998. The Mackinac Bands claims status as a successor apparent to the signatory tribe of the Treaty of Washington (1836) and Treaty of Washington (1855) with the United States of America. Most tribal members live in Emmet, Cheboygan, Presque Isle, and Mackinac counties. As of 2012 the Mackinac Bands of Chippewa and Ottawa Indians has been recognized as a State Historic Tribe by the state of Michigan.

He was killed in an attack by Boko Haram terrorists on May 30, 2014. He was born in 1942, the son of the second Emir of Gwoza, Idrisa Timta. He attended Muslim Elementary School, Gwoza, until 1948 and Senior Primary School in Bama, Nigeria, from 1952 to 1960. He then attended Provincial Secondary School (present-day Government College Maiduguri) from 1960 until 1964. He taught for a short time and then enrolled at Ahmadu Bello University in Zaria, where he studied sharia law. Timta began his career as an inspector of area courts for the former North-Eastern State judicial system. He was promoted to Principal Inspector of Area Courts, a position he held until he became emir in 1981. He was appointed the 3rd Emir of Gwoza, a local government area in present-day Borno State, in October 1981. Timta was elevated to second class emir status in 1987. In January 2014, Governor of Borno State Kashim Shettima further elevated Timta to first class traditional ruler status. On April 13, 2014, Timta condemned the Boko Haram terrorist organization, which is active in the Gwoza area and the rest of Borno State. He decried the group's insurgency, violence and the negative socio-economic impact that it had inflicted on Gwoza. In the speech, Timta said, \\"our people have witnessed increased attacks with mass killings by the insurgents in the last four months. The attacks have crippled both social and economic lives in the entire area...It is sad to say that my people have been blocked from going to the market by the insurgents, who kill at will. Timta appealed to the Nigerian government to prevent further Boko Haram attacks. On May 30, 2014, Timta and two other traditional leaders were traveling to Gombe, Nigeria, for the funeral of the Emir of Gombe Shehu Abubakar, who had died from cancer on May 27. Timta's convoy was attacked by Boko Haram terrorists in an ambush which took place at 9 a.m. on Gombi-Garkida-Biu Road near Biu, Nigeria. Timta was killed in the attack, along with his driver and two policemen, who shielded the other emirs during the ambush.

Ingleton was born in Chester, the son of an accountant. He joined the civil service at age 16, and during World War II was seconded to a radar development project. After the war, he entered Northern Polytechnic, and earned a B.Sc. in mathematics in 1949 as an external student at the University of London, winning first class honours, the Lubbock Prize, and the Sherbrooke Prize. He did his graduate studies in mathematics at King's College London under the supervision of Anthony Francis Ruston, on subjects related to the Hahn–Banach theorem. He took a faculty position at Birkbeck College in 1951, and married in 1952. In 1961 he moved to New College, Oxford, as the Mathematics Tutor. In 1966 he took up a Chair in Pure Mathematics at Cardiff University, but he returned to Oxford in 1967, becoming a fellow of Balliol College, where he remained for the rest of his career. Among his students at Oxford was Paul Seymour. As a mathematician his works are related to many different topics in Analysis, Geometry, Algebra, Topology, Combinatorics and Algebraic Geometry. His work on matroids culminated in the paper \\"Representation of matroids\\" published in 1969. In his work Ingleton studied matroids as a generalization of the concept of linear independence. The paper is a survey about representable matroids as it exhibited matroids representable over C but not over R and similarly over R but not over Q. He included in his paper a single theorem which is a necessary condition of the representability of matroids. This condition is known in the literature as Ingleton's Inequality.

It was founded by Marc Peter Willems in or before 2006, and moved operations to the dark web in 2010 using the Tor anonymity network. It was closed and several operators and users arrested in April 2012 as a result of Operation Adam Bomb, a two-year investigation led by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). Drug market The online black marketplace was launched in or before 2006 by Marc Peter Willems as Adamflowers. The site connected buyers and sellers and mediated transactions of illicit substances through extensive use of Hushmail, an encrypted email service promoted as private and anonymous. It moved operations to a hidden site on the Tor network in 2010 and changed its name to The Farmer's Market. At the same time, it greatly expanded its services to offer not just a venue for transactions, but also customer service features more common to traditional eCommerce, such as guaranteed shipment and merchant screening. Ars Technica described it as \\"like an Amazon for consumers of controlled substances.\\" The Farmer's Market generated revenue through commissions based on the size of each purchase. The site allowed for several forms of payment including cash, PayPal, Western Union, Pecunix, and I-Golder. It managed all communications between buyers and sellers, and blurred the path between them by adding intermediaries known as \\"cash drops\\" who were paid a fee to receive payment from customers and forward it in another payment form to one of multiple bank accounts. The intermediaries and bank accounts were located in places like Panama or Budapest. According to DEA estimates, the site processed about $1 million between 2007 and 2009, and in 2011 the owners made $261,000 through PayPal alone. By 2012, about $2.5 million had been transferred through the site in total. Among the drugs sold at the site were LSD, MDMA, mescaline, fentanyl, ketamine, DMT, hashish, and marijuana, some of which carry substance-specific criminal penalties, depending on the country. An estimated 3000 people in all 50 U.S. states and 45 other countries made transactions, many under age 21. Operation Adam Bomb Over the course of two years the DEA conducted an investigation of The Farmer's Market in cooperation with local U.S. state and international authorities in the Netherlands, Colombia, and Scotland. The investigation used the codename Operation Adam Bomb, after the original name of the site, Adamflowers. In March 2009, a DEA agent who gained access to the site successfully purchased 25 hits of LSD, sending money to Budapest and receiving the drugs in Los Angeles. He repeated the process with a larger order of 500 hits in September 2009. A 2012 indictment contained evidence in the form of hundreds of incriminating emails from 2006–2010. The undercover officer who had purchased LSD was party to several of the included emails. The indictment also indicated cooperation by the U.S. Postal Service and included as evidence that particular defendants had received envelopes at a post office box. An email in the indictment described Hushmail, which the site used extensively, as \\"an encrypted and safe method of communication [which] would not produce e-mails to law enforcement officers.\\" Though Hushmail's complicity with police was not made explicit in the indictment, Wired, Forbes, and the Tor blog suggested it would be likely given previous privacy concerns about the site. The investigation culminated in the April 2012 arrest of fifteen people in the United States, Netherlands, and Colombia. Eight of the individuals were identified as connected to the site and seven individuals were left unnamed, likely site users. The law enforcement agency's 66-page, 12-count indictment named lead defendant Marc Peter Willems of the Netherlands and Michael Evron, an American citizen staying in Buenos Aires, as the two who functioned as \\"organizer, supervisor, and manager\\" of the site. Willems was extradited from the Netherlands after a two-year legal challenge to his extradition. Legal proceedings Willems and Evron were charged with \\"participating in a continuing criminal enterprise,\\" five of the eight arrested were charged with distributing LSD in particular, and all eight with money laundering and conspiracy to distribute controlled substances. In September 2014, the 45-year-old Willems pleaded guilty to drug trafficking and money laundering. He confessed, in a Los Angeles Federal court, to making a profit from the trade of illegal drugs. By the end of 2014, seven of the eight people indicted had entered guilty pleas. The eighth died before the trial began. In September 2014, Willems pleaded guilty to drug trafficking and money laundering charges, and was given a 10-year prison sentence that December.

Fulton, right, addresses audience members as part of a panel with, from left, panel moderator U.S. Navy Capt. Jane Campbell, the director of press operations for the Office of the Secretary of Defense, Public Affairs; Gordon O. Tanner, the principal deputy general counsel for the Air Force; and Marine Corps Capt. Matthew Phelps during a Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Pride Month event in the auditorium at the Pentagon June 26, 2012. The panelists gave their perspectives on their lives and careers in the years before the repeal of Don't Ask, Don't Tell. Brenda S. \\"Sue\\" Fulton is a 1980 graduate of the United States Military Academy at West Point, a member of the Academy's first class to admit women. She commissioned in the Army as a signal officer, serving as both a platoon leader and company commander in Germany before receiving an honorable discharge at the rank of Captain. During her ensuing years in the private sector, Fulton worked briefly with the Campaign for Military Service (later SLDN), supporting President Bill Clinton's efforts to overturn the ban on gay service. These efforts failed, leading to the \\"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\\" policy. After the inauguration of President Barack Obama in 2009, Fulton served as a founding board member of Knights Out, an organization of LGBT West Point graduates, and later OutServe, the association of actively-serving LGBT military members. In those roles, she advocated for repeal of \\"Don't Ask, Don't Tell,\\" and worked closely with the Pentagon on implementation of the repeal. She is still active in Knights Out, and currently serves as the president of SPARTA, an LGBT military group advocating for transgender military service. Fulton was among the more than 75 USMA women alumni who attended the first Ranger School graduation to include women, calling the moment as important as her classmates' own graduation from West Point. In 2011, Obama appointed Fulton to the West Point Board of Visitors, making her the first openly gay person to serve as a board member in its history. She spoke as part of a three-person panel at the first-ever LGBT pride event held at the Pentagon, where she discussed her experiences in the Army and at West Point. In 2013, Fulton openly challenged the Academy leadership on its handling of cadet misconduct, specifically related to sexual harassment and assault. Her tenure has been marked by increased diversity in entering classes, with higher percentages of African-American, Latino, and women cadets. In 2012, Fulton and Penelope Dara Gnesin became the first couple to be married in a same-sex marriage at the U.S. Military Academy's Cadet Chapel at West Point (not to be confused with the Old Cadet Chapel). They currently live in Asbury Park. In 2015, Fulton was elected chairperson of the Board of Visitors at West Point, making her the first woman graduate to hold that position. In February 2018, Governor Phil Murphy of New Jersey appointed Fulton as Chair and Chief Administrator of the Motor Vehicle Commission, the first openly gay member and part of the first majority-female cabinet in New Jersey's history. On July 7, 2020, Fulton oversaw the re-opening of NJ MVC offices throughout the state since COVID-19. The re-opening was a failure as lines stretched long and people had to camp out overnight just to get drivers licenses and registrations. Republicans have called for Fulton’s firing and an investigation into the political appointees of Governor Phil Murphy.

The company is headquartered in Melbourne, Australia.  History  Catapult was founded by engineers Shaun Holthouse and Igor van de Griendt, and is today led by CEO Will Lopes. In 1999 the pair were working with the Cooperative Research Centres (CRC) during a project with the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) seeking to replace laboratory-based performance testing with microtechnology, as athletes were not exerting themselves in lab conditions in the same way as they do in competition. Catapult was launched as a business in 2006 and became a publicly listed company on the Australian Stock Exchange in 2014.  Products  There are three physical products: Catapult Vector, the ClearSky T6 and Optimeye S5. Each of these pieces of hardware is worn by athletes to help track different elements of their performances. ClearSky is a local positioning system (LPS) Catapult developed in conjunction with the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) that delivers accurate positional and inertial data in varying environments. Catapult also developed a pioneering goalkeeper monitor, the G5, which quantifies the direction and intensity of dives, jumps, accelerations/decelerations, changes of direction, repeat high intensity efforts, and time to recovery.

Considering one of the world's top female freestyle wrestlers in her decade, Wagner has claimed a gold and a silver medal in the 48-kg division at the World Championships, and seized an opportunity to compete for Germany at the 2004 Summer Olympics. Throughout her sporting career, Wagner trained full-time as a member of the wrestling squad for Siegfried Sports Club in Hallbergmoos, under her coach and four-time Olympian Jürgen Scheibe. Wagner made sporting headlines, as an 18-year-old teen, at the 2001 World Wrestling Championships in Sofia, Bulgaria, where she took home the bronze medal in the women's 46-kg division. Wagner's early success in wrestling blossomed her career, as she dominated both the 2002 World and 2003 European Championships with two unprecedented gold medals produced in her hardware. When women's wrestling made its debut at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Wagner seized her opportunity to compete in the inaugural 48 kg class. Earlier in the process, she outclassed Russia's Liliya Kaskarakova to snatch both the trophy and Olympic ticket from the Olympic Qualification Tournament in Tunis, Tunisia. She was powerfully pinned by Japan's Chiharu Icho with only two seconds left in the second period during her opening match, but managed to score a 4–3 sudden-death victory over Canada's Lyndsay Belisle in the prelim pool. Despite missing a spot for the semifinals, Wagner wrestled her way to pin Mongolia's Tsogtbazaryn Enkhjargal in a consolation round, before losing out to Russia's Lorisa Oorzhak with a 1–3 decision for a fifth-place finish.

He and his sister, two years his senior, were orphaned five years after his birth. Garabed died when Jean-Joseph was not yet one year old. Onnik first began taking an interest in music when he went to St. Gregory’s Armenian Church in Paris for the first time at the age of 10. They were adopted by his godparents, Nishan and Oghida Dinkjian, who were also from Dikranagerd, and continued to live in Paris. Growing up he learned not only fluent French and Armenian, but also the melodious dialect of Armenians from Dikranagerd. Nishan Dinkjian went to Paris from Aleppo and worked various menial jobs before he fell into the wholesale banana business. When fruit became scarce after the war started in 1939, he went into clothing sales to support his family. Onnik first began taking an interest in music when he went to St. Gregory’s Armenian Church in Paris for the first time at the age of 10. Every Sunday he would need to take two metro rides to get there. The sacred hymns of the liturgy sung by the choir and soloists aroused something within him that would change his life forever. “I absolutely fell in love with the music,” he said. “This is what brought me into the Armenian Church, not necessarily as a religious person but as a lover of the Armenian music.” At the age of 17, in July 1946, Onnik and his family moved to the United States, Nishan Dinkjian’s two sisters had settled. They had been separated during the genocide but desired to live in close proximity with one another. Onnik entered the U.S. with his given name, but would later change it legally to Onnik Dinkjian in honor of his adoptive parents. In 1952, Onnik was drafted into the U.S. Army. In Germany he was assigned to the Winged Victory Chorus, a well-known group led by Joe Baris that performed a wide range of choral works, from composers as diverse as Puccini and Debussy to Rogers and Hammerstein and Irving Berlin. “For a year and a half in Germany all I did was travel from one city to another with some famous American stars, like Eddie Fischer and Danny Kaye, all because of the music, my singing.” When he returned from the army, Onnik opened his own dry cleaning store and married Araksi Maksian (Mghsian) from Lyon, France, whose roots were in Kharpert. They had two children, Anahid and Ara.\\"Portrait of a Legend by Christian Garbis\\" The Armenian Weekly, November 13, 2012 He is a recipient of a 2020 National Heritage Fellowship awarded by the National Endowment for the Arts, which is the United States government's highest honor in the folk and traditional arts.

In 1768 he was supreme interpreter, in its subsequent elevation to the Swedish nobility, he participated in the French-sounding names d'Ohsson. Abraham Constantin Mouradgea d’Ohsson, author of a famous History of the Mongols, was his son. He lived many years in France. Biography He was born at Pera, the European part of Istanbul, in 1740 as Ignatius Muradcan Tosunyan the son of a Catholic family. His father was an interpreter at the Swedish Embassy and followed his father by entering into the service of the Swedish embassy at the Ottoman Porte, and by his talents attained the highest diplomatic honours. He was made charge of affairs, knight of the order of Vasa and in 1782 minister plenipotentiary and envoy extraordinary. His knowledge of the Arabic language and Turkish languages gave him the means of acquiring information respecting the Ottoman Empire from the best sources. He resolved upon writing a history of Ottoman Sultan Selim II, but this was suspended by his plan of giving a full picture of the Ottoman Empire. To this work he devoted himself with the greatest zeal and perseverance, and with great difficulty succeeded in collecting the first authentic information from a prejudiced, servile, and jealous people, respecting and national customs and habitats, the interior of the seraglio, the mosques and the private life of a Turk. With the materials which he had obtained, he proceeded to Paris in 1784, where he prepared his work for the press, and published it in 1788 and 1789, in two volumes, under the title of \\"Tableau Général de l’Empire Othoman.\\" This work completely answered the expectations which had been formed respecting it. The beauty of the typography and engravings occasioned an expense which exceeded the proceeds of the sale; but d'Ohsson who possessed a large fortune, was willing to make sacrifices for the embellishment and perfection of his work. The revolution interrupted his literary activity, and he returned to Constantinople. Sultan Selim III, who honoured knowledge, allowed the two volumes which were published to be presented to him, and, far from being displeased at the disclosure of some secrets, gave orders to facilitate the learned writer's researches by affording him the necessary information. After a long sojourn in Constantinople, d'Ohsson returned to Paris, where he found hardly any traces of his large property. Even the buildings where he had deposited the copies of his work, and the plates, drawings &c.;, had been destroyed and plundered. Without allowing himself to be depressed by these misfortunes, he devised a still greater plan, which had in view a historical picture of the whole East, and became entirely absorbed in his desire to execute it. In 1804 he had completely two volumes of his \\"Tableau Historique de l’Orient,\\" when the war with Sweden made him apprehensive of another interruption. He asked and received permission from his government to retire to the country. Here he continued to occupy himself on his undertaking during three years, and gave the fruit of fifty-four years' labour to the world, in a work which contains, in three separate divisions, a complete view of the Ottoman Empire. These three divisions have the separate titles, \\"Tableau Historique de l’Orient,\\" a history of all nations under the Ottoman government: \\"Tableau Général de l’Empire Othoman,\\" a view of the laws, religion and customs, &c.; lastly, \\"L'Histoire de la Maison Ottomane,\\" from Osman I till 1758.

This might also be termed computer modeling of history, historical simulation, or simulation of history - allowing for an extensive range of techniques in simulation and estimation. Historical dynamics does not exist as a separate science, but there are individual efforts such as long range planning, population modeling, economic forecasting, demographics, global modeling, country modeling, regional planning, urban planning and many others in the general categories of computer modeling, planning, forecasting, and simulations. Some examples of \\"large\\" history where historical dynamics simulations would be helpful include; global history, large structures, histories of empires, long duration history, philosophy of history, Eurasian history, comparative history, long-range environmental history, world systems theory, non-Western political and economic development, and historical demography. Information sources for simulations With the rise of technologies like wikis, and internet-wide search engines, some historical and social data can be mined to constrain models of history and society. Data from social media sites, and busy sites, can be mined for human patterns of action. These can provide more and more realistic behavioral models for individuals and groups of any size. Agent-based models and microsimulations of human behavior can be embedded in larger historical simulations. Related subfields are behavioral economics and human behavioral ecology. * Data mining, web mining, predictive analytics * Social media, web analytics, social networks * Automated translation, natural language processing, Turing test * Crowd computing has been applied to history, and offers another tool for historical verification and validation. Sectoral databases In every sector of human activity, there are extensive databases for transportation data, urban development, health statistics, education data, social data, economic data—along with many projections. See :Category:economic databases, :Category:statistical data sets, :Category:social statistics data, :Category:social statistics and :Category:statistics. Some examples of database activity include Asian Development Bank statistics, World Bank data, and the International Monetary Fund data. Time series analysis and econometrics are well established fields for the analysis of trends and forecasting; but, survey data and microdatasets can also be used in forecasts and simulations. Global, country, and sectoral models in international development The United Nations and other organizations routinely project the population of individual countries and regions of the world decades into the future. These demographic models are used by other organizations for projecting demand for services in all sectors of each economy. * International Monetary Fund - Finance, Government Accounts * Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development * World Health Organization - Health * Food and Agriculture Organization - Food and Agriculture * International Labour Organization - Labour * World Trade Organization - Trade * World Bank - extensive modeling and data activities, Each country often has their corresponding modeling groups for each of these major sectors. These can be grouped in separate articles according to sector. Groups include government departments, international aid agencies, as well as nonprofit and non- governmental organizations. A broad class of models used for economic and social modeling of countries and sectors are the Computable general equilibrium (CGE) model - also called applied general equilibrium models. In the context of time based simulations and policy analysis, see dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models. Linked economic, social, and climate models Partly because of the controversy over global climate change, there is an extensive network of global climate models, and related social and economic models. These seek to estimate, not only the change in climate and its physical effects, but also the impact on human society and the natural environment. See global economic models, social model, microsimulation, climate model, global climate models, and general circulation model. The relationship between the environment and society is examined through environmental social science. human ecology, political ecology, and ecology, in general, can be areas where computer and mathematical modeling over time can be relevant to historical simulation. Historical simulations Web-based historical simulations, simulations of history, interactive historical simulations, are increasingly popular for entertainment and educational purposes. The field is expanding rapidly and no central index seems to be available. Another example is Several computer games allow players to interact with the game to model societies over time. The Civilization (series) is one example. Others include Age of Empires, Rise of Nations, Spore, Colonization, Alpha Centauri, Call to Power, and CivCity: Rome. A longer list of games in historical context, which might include degrees of simulation, are found at :Category:Video games with historical settings. Military simulation is a well-developed field and increasingly accessible on the internet. Simulating society Computer models for simulating society fall under artificial society, social simulation, computational sociology, computational social science, and mathematical sociology. There is an interdisciplinary Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation for computer simulation of social processes. The European Social Simulation Association promotes social simulation research in Europe; it is the publisher of JASSS.European Social Simulation Association There is a corresponding Computational Social Science Society of the Americas., and a Pan-Asian Association for Agent-based Approach in Social Systems Sciences. PAAA lists some related Japanese associations. The SimSoc (Simulated Society tool) is in its fifth edition. Cities There has been extensive research in urban planning, environmental planning and related fields: regional planning, land-use planning, transportation planning, urban studies, and regional science. Journals for these fields are listed at List of planning journals. SimCity is a game for simulations of artificial cities. It has spawned a range of \\"sim\\" games. The planning groups try to simulate changes in real cities. The game groups allow experiments with artificial cities. And the two are merging in such efforts as Vizicities Industry The profiling of industries is well developed, and most industries make forecasts and plans. See industrial history, history of steel, history of mining, history of construction, history of the petroleum industry, and many other histories of specific industries. See cyclical industrial dynamics for modeling of industries in the sense of \\"historical dynamics of industries\\". Some related terms are industrial planning, history of industry, industrial evolution, technology change, and technology forecasting. An example of \\"history friendly\\" industrial models. from the journal, Industrial and Corporate Change. Economy-wide models must take into account the interactions between industry and the rest of the economy. See Input–output model, economic planning, and social accounting matrix for some relevant techniques. Futures Many of the techniques from futures studies are applicable to historical dynamics. Whether projecting forward from a point in the past to the present for validation studies, or projecting backwards from the present into the past - many of the techniques are useful. Likewise, simulations of the past, or alternative pasts, provide a groundwork of techniques for futures studies.

It is the dominant health insurance in Iowa. It is an independent licensee of the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association. Founded in 1939, Wellmark offers dental and health insurance as well as life insurance. It began participating in the health care exchange for 2017. History In 1939, 'Hospital Service Incorporated of Iowa' (later known as Blue Cross of Iowa) began business in Des Moines, Iowa. That same year, 'Associated Hospital Services Incorporated' (later known as Blue Cross of Western Iowa and South Dakota) was established in Sioux City, Iowa. In 1945, Iowa Medical Service (later known as Blue Shield of Iowa) was formed. In 1948, Associated Hospital Services began doing business in South Dakota and marketing activities as Blue Cross. In 1956 'South Dakota Medical Service' began doing business in South Dakota as South Dakota Blue Shield. In 1986, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Iowa purchased Benefit Administrators of America, Inc., a third-party administrator, which was the plans' first for-profit venture. Benefit Administrators of America was renamed Wellmark Administrators, Inc. in 1997. In 1989, Blue Cross of Iowa, Blue Shield of Iowa and Blue Cross of Western Iowa and South Dakota merged to form 'IASD Health Services Corporation'. In 1991, IASD Health Services Corporation became a mutual insurance. In 1994, Blue Cross Blue Shield (BCBS) allowed its licensees to be for-profit corporations,Coordinated Issue Paper – Blue Cross Blue Shield/Health Insurance; Life Insurance: Conversion of nonprofit corporations. 4 June 2008) and the joint service agreement of Blue Cross of South Dakota and South Dakota Blue Shield expired, putting the two plans in competition with one another. In 1996, Blue Shield of South Dakota merged into IASD to form a single company. Blue Cross of South Dakota and South Dakota Blue Shield merged into 'South Dakota Health Services Company' doing business as Blue Cross Blue Shield of South Dakota. In 1997, the companies were branded as Wellmark Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Iowa and Wellmark Blue Cross and Blue Shield of South Dakota. Companies Wellmark is headquartered in downtown Des Moines and Sioux Falls. It has 1707 employees in Iowa and 171 in South Dakota. It consists of Wellmark Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Iowa, Wellmark of South Dakota, Inc. (doing business as Wellmark Blue Cross and Blue Shield of South Dakota) and Wellmark Health Plan of Iowa, Inc. The Wellmark Foundation is a private foundation to support health improvement initiatives in Iowa and South Dakota. Wellmark insures almost 1.8 million Iowans and more than 300,000 South Dakotans. It is Iowa's largest and dominant insurer but has not participated in the government's health care exchange for two years in a row. During its open enrollment period from October 1, 2013 to March 31, 2014 more than 41,000 people in Iowa and South Dakota enrolled in 24,000 \\"Affordable Care Act-compliant health plans\\" by Wellmark. Cliff Gold, former Wellmark employee, then chief operating officer of Iowa's CoOportunity, said that \\"they have denied consistently, that they [...] push bad risk into the exchanges.\\" Organization the Board of Directors consists of 11 members, namely Thomas M. Cink, Melanie C. Dreher, John D. Forsyth, Daryl K. Henze, William C. (Curt) Hunter, Paul E. Larson, Angeline M. Lavin, Terrence J. Mulligan, Dave Neil, Timothy J. Theriault, Terri M. Vaughan. The CEO is John D. Forsyth. Economic aspects Wellmark's credit rating from Standard and Poor's was \\"A+\\" (Strong). According to Wellmark's 2013 balance sheet its assets were $2,357,637, its liabilities $1,003,329 and its reserves were $1,354,308. As of 2014, Wellmark explains that premiums are spent as follows: 86.6% on payment for health care services, 7.6% for administrative services, 3.9% on commissions, 1.3% for earnings on premiums, and 0.4% on premium tax. Wellmark Health Plan of Iowa had to refund $651,895 to customers, because it did not meet specifications of the 80/20 rule in the Affordable Care Act, which requires insurers to spend at least 80 percent of premium dollars on patient care and quality improvement activities. Most rebates in Iowa ($1.1 million) were owed by Coventry Healthcare of Iowa Inc. Rate increases Wellmark raised premiums on individual policy holders by between 12 and 13 percent in 2013, 9.4 percent in 2012, 8.5 percent in 2011 and 18 percent in 2010. As of June 2014 Wellmark is seeking to increase rates again, apparently by less than 5.9 percent for the majority of insured, and by 11.9 percent and 14.5 percent for people enrolled after the Affordable Care Act went into effect. Rate increases above average per CSA require a public hearing in front of the Iowa Commissioner of Insurance; in 2013 the Commission received a total of 300 comments, 240 of which expressed rate increase weariness, and that some increases reached nearly 50 percent since 2010. The second most common comment had to do with affordability, and the third highest reoccurring comment was Wellmark's discretionary spending. Individual comments criticized the chairman's salary of $3.1 million The Insurance Division's actuary and an independent actuary reviewed Wellmark's data and both found the rate request was not discriminatory, but was supported by the data. Criticism In 2010, Wellmark opened its $250 million headquarters, and at the same time raising premiums by double-digit percentages annually. The CEO justified the reserves, or found them possibly even a bit too low, considering that Wellmark pays out more than $5 billion per year in claims.

The University of Minnesota basketball scandal involved National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) rules violations, most notably academic dishonesty, committed by the University of Minnesota men's basketball program. The story broke the day before the 1999 NCAA Tournament, when the St. Paul Pioneer Press reported that Minnesota academic counseling office manager Jan Gangelhoff had done coursework for at least 20 Minnesota basketball players since 1993. In the resulting scandal, four players from the Minnesota basketball team were immediately suspended, pending an investigation for academic fraud. Head coach Clem Haskins, men's athletic director Mark Dienhart, and university vice president McKinley Boston all resigned. Minnesota voluntarily sat out the 1999–2000 postseason, among other self- imposed sanctions. In 2000, the NCAA placed the Minnesota men's basketball program on four years' probation and reduced scholarships, based on numerous findings of academic fraud, improper benefits, and other ethics violations. St. Paul Pioneer Press reporting On March 10, 1999, the day before Minnesota was to play in the first round of the NCAA Tournament, the St. Paul Pioneer Press reported, in an article by George Dohrmann, that Jan Gangelhoff, an office manager of the university academic counseling unit, alleged that she had completed hundreds of pieces of coursework for more than 20 Minnesota men's basketball players. According to Dohrmann, former players including Courtney James and Bobby Jackson corroborated Gangelhoff's claims. Gangelhoff provided him with printed samples of coursework written by her and turned in by students. Among other allegations by Gangelhoff: she was allowed to continue assisting players despite being caught in 1996 doing a take-home exam with a player, an assistant coach drove players to Gangelhoff's home for tutoring sessions in possible violation of NCAA rules, Gangelhoff duplicated the same work for different student-athletes to turn in to different classes, and coach Clem Haskins paid Gangelhoff in cash to tutor players. Immediately after the Pioneer Press reported this story, the University of Minnesota began an investigation, suspending four players for the NCAA Tournament: starters Kevin Clark and Miles Tarver, and reserves Antoine Broxsie and Jason Stanford, alleged as among those for whom Gangelhoff had done work. Minnesota lost to Gonzaga in the first round of the tournament on March 11. Minnesota governor Jesse Ventura accused the Pioneer Press of timing the article to be published around NCAA Tournament time for the sake of \\"sensationalism journalism.\\" The newspaper received many hostile calls and letters in response to this report. After the March 10 article, two more people came forward claiming to have done coursework for Minnesota basketball players: Gangelhoff's sister Jeanne Payer and Alexandra Goulding, a Minnesota sociology doctoral candidate. In a Pioneer Press article published on March 24, 1999, Goulding said that she wrote a paper for Minnesota starting forward Courtney James in 1995. After telling coach Haskins that she would never do student-athletes' assignments again, Goulding said Haskins responded: \\"[James] needed a lot of help.\\" NCAA investigation and findings On October 24, 2000, the NCAA published its public infractions report relating to University of Minnesota men's basketball. Among its findings of rules violations: *Gangelhoff prepared nearly 400 pieces of coursework for at least 18 basketball players; *Alonzo Newby, the academic counselor assigned to men's basketball at Minnesota, orchestrated the academic fraud; *Head coach Clem Haskins knew about Gangelhoff's fraudulent activities, and improperly provided benefits to Gangelhoff and Newby; *In 1986, an academics counselor quoted Haskins in a memo as saying: \\"If someone doing a paper for a student-athlete would allow him the opportunity to be eligible to compete and therefore succeed, we need to do the paper for him;\\" *The academic counselor and other basketball staffers intimidated professors and registrar staff into changing grades for student-athletes to maintain eligibility. Additionally, the NCAA discovered that Haskins and other staffers had provided improper benefits to recruits and student-athletes, including cash payments made to student-athletes. Rules violations extended to football and men's ice hockey student-athletes, as well. Sanctions =Self-imposed= Following an internal investigation launched on March 19, 1999, the university self-imposed the following sanctions on its men's basketball program, among others: *A postseason ban for the 1999–00 season; *A reduction of three scholarships for the 1999–00 season and a total of four scholarships reduced from the 2000–01 and 2003–04 seasons; *Forfeiture of 90% of money earned from appearances in the 1994, 1995, and 1997 NCAA Tournaments. On June 25, 1999, the university paid $1.5 million to buy out the contract of Clem Haskins. It hired Gonzaga head coach Dan Monson a month later to replace Haskins. This was four months after Gonzaga beat Minnesota in the NCAA Tournament. On November 19, 1999, the same day that Minnesota released its report of its internal investigation of the scandal, Minnesota president Mark Yudof accepted the resignations of vice president McKinley Boston and men's athletic director Mark Dienhart. Three years later, on May 13, 2002, Hennepin County District Judge Deborah Hedlund ordered Haskins to return $815,000 of the $1.5 million in buyout money paid to him. This was based on an arbitrator's recommendation, after the university argued that Haskins had committed fraud by lying to the NCAA yet accepting the buyout money. =NCAA= Following its investigation, the NCAA issued the following sanctions to the university: *Four years of probation until October 23, 2004; *A reduction of five scholarships in total until the 2003–04 season; *A reduction of six paid visits by recruits until the 2002–03 season; *Vacancy of all appearances in the 1994, 1995, and 1997 NCAA Tournaments and 1996 and 1998 National Invitational Tournaments, as well as individual records of those student-athletes found to have committed academic fraud; and *Show-cause penalties for Haskins and Newby (both until October 23, 2007) and Gangelhoff (until October 23, 2005). Extension of probation In July 2002, the NCAA found Minnesota Golden Gophers women's basketball liable for multiple rule violations regarding practice time and benefits that occurred under the watch of then-head coach Cheryl Littlejohn from 1998 to 2001. Because the NCAA treated the women's basketball violations as a separate matter from the men's basketball academic violations, Minnesota avoided being designated a repeat violator and getting the \\"death penalty\\" for the women's basketball program. Instead, the NCAA extended the existing probationary period until 2006. Aftermath Broxsie transferred to Oklahoma State after the spring 1999 semester. In 2000, Dohrmann won the Pulitzer Prize for beat reporting for his reports on the scandal. According to Geneva Overholser of the Project for Excellence in Journalism, \\"the closeness of the sports writing community, Dohrmann and his editor knew, meant that others would be quite ready to turn on them if their work fingered some of the Twin Cities' most beloved figures.\\" Minnesota finished its first season under NCAA probation 18–14, including an appearance in the 2001 NIT. In November 2001, the Star Tribune reported that new coach Monson \\"rebuilt\\" the Minnesota men's basketball program after the scandal \\"faster than seemed possible.\\" Minnesota made the NIT again in 2002 and 2003 and next made the NCAA Tournament in 2005. Haskins worked as a scout for the Minnesota Timberwolves for a year after leaving the University of Minnesota. He then retired to his farm in Campbellsville, Kentucky. Dienhart became an executive at US Bank after resigning as men's athletic director. He returned to higher education in 2001 as senior vice president for institutional advancement at his alma mater, the University of St. Thomas in Saint Paul, Minnesota. He was later appointed as executive vice president and chief operating officer, serving until 2013 when he went to a foundation. From 2004 to 2014, Boston was athletic director at New Mexico State University.

Gross has claimed four medals (three silver and one bronze) at the World Championships (1997, 1998, 2000, and 2007), and seized an opportunity to compete for Germany at the 2004 Summer Olympics. Before her sporting career ended in 2008, Gross trained full-time as a member of the wrestling squad for AC Ückerath in Dormagen, North Rhine-Westphalia, under her father and personal coach Walter Groß. Gross began her career as a judoka, before she sought sights to wrestling at the age of fifteen. In 1997, Gross emerged herself into a sporting fame at the World Championships in Clermont-Ferrand, France, where she claimed a silver medal in the 62-kg division. Before her major Olympic debut, she held a stunning combined record of five medals; three of which came from the World Championships, and the other two from the European Championships. When women's wrestling made its debut at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Gross qualified for the German squad, as a 29-year-old veteran in the 63 kg class. Earlier in the process, she earned an Olympic spot by taking second at the final Olympic Qualification Tournament in Madrid, Spain after missing out a coveted place from the World Championships. She lost her opening match 1–4 to the host nation's Stavroula Zygouri by the massive clamor of the home crowd inside Ano Liossa Olympic Hall, but rallied for a three-point victory by beating Sweden's Sara Eriksson in her second bout to close the prelim pool. Despite missing a spot for the semifinals, Gross seized an opportunity to face against Canadian wrestler and 2003 world bronze medalist Viola Yanik in the consolation round, but she could not score enough points to push her opponent off the mat, and lost the match 1–4, placing only seventh in the final standings. At the 2007 World Wrestling Championships in Baku, Azerbaijan, Gross fell short of a chance to take her first ever trophy after losing out to Frenchwoman Audrey Prieto with a 2–10 decision, but guaranteed to cease her nine-year medal drought with a silver.

The storm formed on June 13 and dissipated on June 18. Hagibis made landfall on June 15, causing damage estimated to be US$198 million. Hagibis is a Filipino word, meaning fast or swiftness. Meteorological history On June 11, 2014, a broad, poorly-defined area of low pressure formed over the South China Sea. Extensive, though disorganized, deep convection accompanied the system. Situated within a region of low to moderate wind shear and weak outflow, slow development ensued. By June 13, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified the disturbance as a tropical depression. A monsoonal system, the depression featured an extensive circulation with the strongest winds well away from the center, contrary to most tropical cyclones. A scatterometer pass revealed winds up to 65 km/h (40 mph) within a banding feature to the east of the storm's center by the evening of June 13. In accordance with this, the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm 1407 and assigned the name Hagibis to the cyclone. Despite the presence of gale-force winds, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) deemed the system to be below storm intensity and only issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert early on June 14, indicating that it was likely to become a tropical cyclone within 24 hours. Thereafter, the tropical storm-force winds contracted to within 130 km (80 mi) of the center, indicative of a more tropical than monsoonal system. As such, the JTWC initiated advisories on the system as Tropical Storm 07W. Early on June 15, Hagibis made landfall over southern China, and it subsequently weakened to a tropical depression. On the morning of June 16, both agencies issued their final warnings on Hagibis as it weakened further to a land depression. Its remnants still continued to move northward, but by June 17, the remnants of Hagibis curved eastwards due to the jet stream. Later that day, the remnants entered moved back over warm waters, and accompanied by low vertical wind shear, and the storm re-intensified. The JMA upgraded Hagibis to a tropical storm once again, and both the JTWC and the JMA re-initiated advisories on the system. Early on June 18, Hagibis transitioned into an extratropical cyclone, and its circulation was absorbed by a developing extratropical storm to the north on June 21. The system moved out of the basin early on June 23. Impacts Tropical Storm Hagibis with the southwest monsoon on June 14 =Philippines= Although Hagibis did not enter the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR), it did threaten the Philippines by enhancing the southwest monsoon, bringing torrential rainfall to the country. Due to extreme rainfall since Tropical Storm Mitag on June 10, the Philippine Atmospheric Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) declared the official start of the rainy season. It was reported that 17 towns in Maguindanao province were flooded. As a result, a total of more than 90,000 people were affected. Extreme rainfall continued to affect the country until June 27, when a tropical disturbance affecting northern Luzon ceased. =China= Hagibis made landfall over southern China at 04:50 UTC on June 15. Torrential rain continued to bring flooding until June 22, as the southwest monsoon weakened. No people were killed, and total economic losses in Mainland China were counted to be CNY 1.23 billion (US$198 million).

It was designed by John Horbury Hunt and built from 1881 to 1888. It is also known as Camelot and Kirkham. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. Camelot was completed in 1888 in the Late Victorian style and has been used as a television and film location.  History  This area was originally home to the Muringong, southernmost of the Darug people. In 1805 John Macarthur established his property at Camden where he farmed merino sheep. In 1810, explorer John Oxley was granted nearby, which he named Kirkham, after his birthplace in Yorkshire. Oxley had a homestead and stables built in 1816 (today this is in separate ownership, across Kirkham Lane) and, probably sometime later, a Mill. Oxley died in 1828 in straightened economic circumstances, his widow and children were granted by the Executive Council, although she was refused a pension. The house was demolished in 1882; the heritage-listed stables, which date from 1816, are all that remain. The existing Camelot was designed by the Canadian-born architect John Horbury Hunt for James White, New South Wales politician and great-uncle of Patrick White. It was completed in 1888 on the site of Oxley's old Kirkham Mill, and partly on its foundations. Folklore has it that the house was financed by the winnings from one of James White's horses, called Chester, which won the 1877 Melbourne Cup.Camden History.org James White bought the property in the mid 1870s and it became his primary race horse-stud. White was a highly successful breeder, his horses won five A.J.C. Derbys, five A.J.C. Sires' Produce Stakes, five V.R.C. St Legers and six V.R.C. Derbys between 1877 and 1890. The attention paid to the design and construction of the stables by White and Hunt reflects the important part horse racing played in the White family. His wife, Emily Elizabeth, whom he married in 1856, shared his passion for racing. Prior to moving to Kirkham, as it was then known, White was educated at the King's School, Parramatta. On his father's death, James managed Edinglassie, Timor and Boorooma. In 1848 James leased Belltrees, in partnership with brothers Francis and George. Management of the property was so successful that they purchased Belltrees in 1853. The partnership continued to buy properties in the Upper Hunter region. In around 1860 James White bought Martindale, near Muswellbrook, where he lived for a number of years. By 1864 he was a magistrate and in December of the same year was elected to the Legislative Assembly for the Upper Hunter. His main political interests were railway expansion, taxes on luxuries and an interest in free selection. In 1868 White resigned from parliament to tour England and the United States. While he was away his brothers, on behalf of the partnership, continued to buy properties. On his return he ran for the seat of Upper Hunter again, but was defeated. His first association with architect John Horbury Hunt was in about 1873 when Horbury Hunt carried out large scale extensions to newly purchased Cranbrook, Rose Bay. In the following year James White entered the Legislative Council and took on a range of committee positions, including the Royal Society and was a founding member of the natural history Linnean Society of NSW, the Agricultural Society of NSW, the Horticultural Society of NSW, the Union Club, the Animals' Protection Society of NSW, the Warrigal Club and a director/chairman of the Mercantile Bank of Sydney. In light of his passion for racing, he was a long-time member of the Australian Jockey Club and became chairman in 1880 and then again between 1883 and 1890. White must have been impressed by Hunt's extensions to Cranbrook as he engaged Hunt in 1888 to build him a \\"rural seat\\" at Kirkham. Allegedly, the finances for Kirkham came from the prize money of one of White's most successful horses, Chester. In early 1890 White began selling his race horses and retiring from committees. He died at Cranbrook on 13 July 1890, perhaps never having lived in Hunt's creation at Kirkham. The property was left to his wife, who sold it about ten years later to the Faithfull Anderson family. Their interest may have been the success White had achieved with his horse stud, given they also had interests in horse racing. In Faithfull-Anderson family bought the property. It was originally called Kirkham, but the name was changed to Camelot by a new owner, Frances Faithful-Anderson, wife of William Anderson, who bought the house in the 1890s. When she saw the house, she was reminded of lines in Tennyson's poem The Lady of Shalott, which make a reference to Camelot. The youngest daughter of William Pitt Faithfull, Mrs. Frances Lillian, lived there for much of her life and died there in 1948. Before the Great Depression Mrs. Faithfull Anderson frequently hosted large parties, but her inability to keep a large staff during the Depression saw the end of these gatherings. She was remembered for the energy, enthusiasm and generosity she brought to the large number of local causes she was involved in, including the Camden Branch of the Red Cross, the Women's Voluntary Services and the Country Women's Association. In the lead-up to World War II Mrs. Faithfull Anderson realised that aircraft would be needed to adequately defend Australia. With this purpose in mind, she offered the Government a donation to buy several aircraft and, as a result, a training facility was established nearby. The mansion was bought in 1999 by the current owners, Camden businessman, Brendan Powers and his wife, Rachel.Sun Herald, 24/12/2006 Camelot was used extensively as a location in the 2013 - 2018 television series A Place to Call Home, in which it was known as Ash Park. It was also used in the 2008 Baz Luhrmann film Australia.  Description  =Garden= A large late 19th century garden with early 20th century alterations surrounding an important country house designed by the architect Horbury Hunt. The garden, consisting of shrubberies, flower garden, drive and vegetable gardens is enclosed within a large olive hedged rectangle. A subtly curving drive leads from the entrance gates (originally from Yaralla, Concord, re-erected at Camelot) along the northern boundary of the garden along the northern front of the house where it widens into a forecourt, then continues to the stables at the south-west corner. The eastern, garden front, of the house overlooks a gently sloping lawn and terra-cotta edged flower and rose beds, separated from the drive by a hedge and picket fence. Beyond this garden, to the east, are the remains of further lawns and shrubberies (the \\"Duck Pond\\" and 'the Pleasance') now completely overgrown. Beyond the house are the remains of the orchard and vegetable gardens.Survey of Gardens in New South Wales - National Trust, 1981 =Building complex= *Stables 1816 (Oxley) *Cottage 1881 (Horbury Hunt for James White) Race Horse breeder (plus Kirkham stables to north) * Stables & Smoke House (brick domed structure) (Horbury Hunt for White) * Cottage (Horbury Hunt, 2 storey) * House/Mansion (Horbury Hunt for White) * Faithfull-Anderson family bought the property. Camelot was the last of the \\"red brick\\" buildings by John Horbury Hunt, who favoured brick as a building material. The main building is distinguished by a large number of bay windows, chimneys, kitchen stacks, balconies, gables, turrets and stepped wings. It is complemented by a beehive-shaped smoke house, an octagonal aviary that started life as a hen's house, and the largest stables ever designed by the architect. There is also a gardener's lodge that is considered a notable building in its own right. The house is set off by an extensive Victorian-style garden and has been described as \\"a monument to the skill of its creator.\\" Camelot is a complex consisting of a cottage, \\"rural seat\\", stables and a smoke house. The stables are a remnant related to the earlier homestead built by Surveyor-General John Oxley. The homestead itself has been demolished. After James White purchased the property a two-storey brick cottage, attributed to John Horbury Hunt, was constructed by 1881. The cottage consists of two bedrooms, over three rooms on the ground floor. A two- storey kitchen block, with verandah, was added later. In 1888 White employed Hunt to design him a \\"rural seat\\". Reynolds and Hughes describe it as a \\"highly individual two-storey house facing north-east\\". It was constructed on the site of the old Oxley Mill, reusing stone in the basement kitchen and service areas. The roof line is exceedingly complex, with numerous shapes and gables, \\"including a faceted wing, a curved Hipped bay and a collection of tall chimney stacks\\".Reynolds & Hughes 2002:138 This collection is augmented by multiple chimneys, including an industrial sized kitchen stack unique to Camelot. A smaller coned tower was added by the Faithfull Anderson family after they purchased the property in 1900. Internally, a small vestibule opens into a large entrance hall, leading to the dining room and faceted drawing room - both with verandahs. Opposite, the morning room features a faceted bay, again unique to Hunt's other designs. The rear of the ground floor is single storey, with a lantern roof, under which is the ballroom, complete with musicians' alcove. Another usual feature of Camelot is the main staircase. The landing projects beyond the external wall and forms the base of a semicircular tower, terminating in a candle-snuffer roof, complete with finial. New stables were also constructed, located between Camelot and the cottage. These are the largest designed by Hunt. The stables feature a \\"majestic church-like roof\\" and a timber planked floor, to allow for more efficient cleaning. The beehive smokehouse located nearby was probably Hunts work also. = Condition = As at 21 January 2015, apart from the lawns and flower beds directly around the house and drive, the garden is extremely overgrown and almost impossible to plot. = Modifications and dates = *Stables 1816 (Oxley) *Cottage 1881 (Horbury Hunt for James White) Race Horse breeder (plus Kirkham stables to north) * Stables & Smoke House (brick domed structure)(Horbury Hunt for White) * House/Mansion (Horbury Hunt for White) * Faithfull-Anderson family buy property. *The Servants' Quarters have been recently restored and had their joinery repaired and reinstated.Powell, pers.comm., 6/10/2015  Heritage listing  As at 22 June 2016, Camelot is one of the finest country houses with associated buildings designed by architect John Horbury Hunt, remaining in excellent condition and virtually unaltered. It is surrounded by a large late 19th century garden with early 20th century alterations. The landscape value of its mature planting, the completeness of its layout and the association with one of the most exceptional late 19th century houses in Australia is also significant. Camelot (Kirkham) was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Camelot is of State significance through its association with race horse breeding. James White used Camelot as his primary stud and raised several Derby winners, including Nordenfeldt, Trident, Ensign, Dreadnought and Singapore. White built his stud on colts sired by Martini Henry, breed in New Zealand and Chester from E.K. Cox. White did much to advance horse racing in Australia, the culmination of this being his election as chairman of the Australian Jockey Club in 1880 and again between 1883 and 1890. On the track White's horses, between 1877 and 1890, won five A.J.C. Derbys, five A.J.C. Sires' Produce Stakes, five V.R.C. St Legers and six V.R.C. Derbys. The Anderson Faithfull family also had interests in race horses and may have continued to use Camelot as a stud. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. Camelot is of State significance through its associations with James White. White had substantial influence in New South Wales through his positions in the Legislative Council and the Legislative Assembly, as a magistrate, and as a member of numerous committees, including the Australian Jockey Club. White did much to promote horse racing and was a highly successful breeder. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Camelot is a distinctive and unusual house, described as a \\"fairy castle\\", designed by John Horbury Hunt.

Rick Timmo had his first rides at Napier, where he spent three years before being advised by Colin McKee to try his luck in England. McKee fixed a trial for Timmo at Hackney but promoter Danny Dunton signed him up for Oxford where he stayed for a number of years and became a fans favourite. Barry Briggs, another Kiwi, tried to tempt Timmo to ride for Swindon Robins but he declined. In the season 1968–69, Timmo toured with the British Lions in New Zealand. His performance made him a NZ favourite and he would go on to ride for his home country against England, Australia and Sweden. His career was prematurely ended when he had a nasty crash at a grasstrack meeting and broke his femur. Retiring from speedway he returned home to Napier where he set up a business – Timmo Motorcycles.

Its common name is the sunny stick insect, derived from the less commonly used sungay stick insect. It is a species in the order of the stick insects Phasmatodea and the only member of the genus Sungaya. The genus name refers to the locality of the holotype, i.e. the region where the insect was first identified. The species name is derived from the Latin as \\"inexpectatus\\" and means \\"unexpected\\".Oliver Zompro: Bemerkungen über philippinische Obrimiden, mit einer Neubeschreibung (Phasmatodea: Heteropterygidae: Obriminae). Entomologische Zeitschrift (1996 b) 106 (11): 450-456.  Discovery and occurrence  Oliver Zompro collected the first specimen of this species, a nymph, on 8 September 1995 in Baranggay Sungay in the province of Batangas-associated township Talisayon on the Philippine island of Luzon. She died a short time later due to a failed molting during transport. On October 7, 1995, he was almost at the same location where he collected an adult female, which he described in 1996 as the holotype of the species, and which is currently located at the Zoological Museum at the University of Kiel. Zompro discovered more females in 1999 near the Taal Lake.Oliver Zompro: Zur Entdeckung von Sungaya inexpectata Zompro, 1996, Arthropoda 16 (2) August 2008, Sungaya-Verlag Kiel. The first males were discovered in 2008 by Orlando L. Eusebio, SA Yap and AR Larona, also on Luzon, more precisely at Mount Cayapo of the Mariveles Mountains in Baranggay Alangan in of the province of Bataan in the associated township Limay.Dr. Ireneo L.

Features  The species is sexually dimorphic, with females larger than the males. The females reach a length of 80 to 85 millimeters and a weight of about five grams. The males are leaner and significantly smaller at 50 to 56 millimeters in length. The coloring of the females is fairly varied. The females tend to have more contrasting colors, with areas of dark brown, light brown and black, with white bands on the legs and/or body. Particularly striking are females with a white vertical line over the entire body. Rarely, there are females in which green tones dominate the basic color. The males tend to be light brown or medium brown and have on the mesonotuman and metanotuman a sometimes indistinct, wide longitudinal line that may be, depending on the base color, a dark brown on light background or light brown on dark background. Both sexes are wingless and have relatively short and blunt spines, with particularly the spiked crown on the back of the head and the four spines on mesonotum and metanotum. These are slightly pointed and especially sharp in the females. At the end of the female's abdomen, they have a beaked secondary ovipositor, which surrounds the primary ovipositor.Christoph Seiler, Sven Bradler & Rainer Koch: Phasmiden - Pflege und Zucht von Gespenstschrecken, Stabschrecken und Wandelnden Blättern im Terrarium - bede, Ruhmannsfelden 2000,  Reproduction  The species reproduces both sexually and by parthenogenesis. The first offspring of a wild-caught animal will lay eggs about 4.5 millimeters long and 3.7 millimeters wide, in groups of 10 to 12, approximately every two weeks. Later generation lay their eggs individually into the damp earth. Meanwhile, females are known to leave their eggs just fall to the ground. After 4 to 6 months the nymphs hatch which are 17 millimeters long at hatching.Oliver Zompro: Gespenstschrecken der Familie Heteropterygidae im Terrarium - Reptilia - Terraristik Fachmagazin (Nr.24, August/September 2000) Natur und Tier, Münster 2000 While the nymphs of the original strain, as well as their fresh adult females, are very bright, the newly hatched nymphs of sexually propagated animals are often colored dark gray instead. Later, they show a remarkable color variability from molt to molt, especially the female nymphs. The entire development from first instar to adult takes about three to four months.  Captivity  The first of the adult wild-caught females captured by Oliver Zompro lay only four eggs before it died. From these three hatched nymphs, two of which grew into adult females. For years, the entire culture was produced asexually from these females. This first breeding stock is now referred to as \\"Highland\\" shape. In 2008 a new colony was started with males introduced, and these are referred to as the \\"Lowland\\" shape. The animals need temperatures of 22 to 27 °C and a humidity between 60 and 80 percent. They are most active at night. During the day they sit camouflage themselves on their food plants, which preferably have similar colors as the animals themselves. Their food plants should be kept in narrow-necked vases in the terrarium and placed about every two days sprayed with water using a spray bottle. They primarily eat bramble, although they can also feed on Hawthorn and other deciduous plants. For oviposition, a good five inches high layer of damp humus-sand mixture should cover the ground. The eggs can be left in the ground or for better control can be transferred to a simple incubator.Oliver Zompro: Grundwissen Pasmiden – Biologie - Haltung - Zucht.

It had been a refuge for survivors of the Armenian Genocide from the 1930s until the 1950s, built in a swamp area which during ancient times had for at least one and a half millennia been a necropolis. In recent decades it has been \\"at the center of Tyre’s experience with precarity\\" and \\"a space that feels permanent yet unfinished, suspended in time.\\"  Territory  Ancient ruins with the modern buildings of the camp in the back: between the sites are bushes and trees with the remaining marshes El Buss is located in the North-Eastern part of the Sour municipality. While Tyre as a whole is commonly known as Sour in Arabic, its urban area comprises parts of four municipalities: Sour, Ain Baal, Abbassieh and Burj El Chamali. The two latter ones are close to El-Buss. Burj El Shimali, about 2 km to the East of El-Buss also hosts a Palestinian refugee camp, while the gathering of Jal Al Baher to the North and the neighbourhhod of Maashouk 1 km to the East are informal settlements for Palestinian refugees. To the South of El Buss camp - separated through a wall and the remaining water pools of the original marshland - is the vast archaeological site of El-Buss, which is popular with tourists. An entrance/exit for pedestrians at the Northern side of El Buss camp towards the corniche (Photo by Cluster Munition Coalition/2011) The camp covers a total area of approximately 1 square kilometer. At its Northern side the camp borders the main roads at the entry to the Tyre peninsula and to its Eastern side the North-South Beirut-Naqoura Sea Road. Hence, it is severely affected by heavy traffic jams at the crossroads, especially during peak hours at the El Buss roundabout. The camp has a number of entrances for pedestrians, but only one - on the South-Eastern side - for vehicles. Entry and exit there is controlled at a checkpoint by the Lebanese Armed Forces. Foreign visitors have to present permits from Military Intelligence to them. > \\"although it is a labyrinth of tiny alleys crisscrossing each other > haphazardly, it is much less crowded and daunting than some of the other > camps across the country.\\" A 2017 census counted 687 buildings with 1,356 households in el-Buss. Most of the buildings are concrete block shelters, considered to be of poor quality. While the building situation in the eastern part around the former Armenian camp is dense, the western part of the camp has developed in a more informal manner. The many businesses, especially mechanical workshops for cars, on the Northern side along the main road integrate the outer fringe of the camp into the townscape. However, > \\"Though very much a part of the city’s urban fabric, El-Buss remains a > peripheral space\\". And as Tyre like all of Southern Lebanon has been marginalised throughout modern history, El Buss camp is actually even > \\"peripheral within the periphery\\". History = Pre-modern history of the site =  Ancient history  = Phoenician times = El Buss refugee camp is located in a historical site that dates back at least three thousand years. A Phoenician cremation cemetery from the Iron Age was uncovered in an area of some 500 square meters in the southeastern corner of the camp, the first discovery of its kind and with about 320 excavated urns the most densely occupied Phoenician cemetery known in the Levant. El Buss was the principal graveyard for the maritime merchant-republic city-state of Tyre in its most expansive and prosperous era for almost four hundred years. It thus offers unique windows into the Phoenician past: The cemetery was established at the end of the tenth century BCE on what was then a sea-beach at the edge of the coast opposite of what was then the island city of Tyre. The beach originally also bordered the southern edge of an ancient creek delta. The landscape shifted though over the centuries and millennia. Hence, the creek bay turned into a lagoon, separated from the sea by a sand bar: > \\"Paleobotanical and faunal analyses of the sand sediment in the area show > that the creek became a lake during the ninth and eighth centuries B.C.E.\\" The most common type of burial in this necropolis was made up of twin-urns with the remains of the same individual - one containing the ashes and the other the bones mixed personal possessions, as well as two jugs and a bowl for drinking. About a fifth of the discovered urns with bone remains contained a scarab-amulet. The researchers, led by Professor María Eugenia Aubet from the Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona, also excavated a few stelae which bore inscriptions and human masks sculpted from terracotta. Some of them are considered to be masterpieces and on display at the National Museum of Beirut. Altogether, one has to imagine a beach with such personalised gravestones sticking out of the sand, with a view on the fortified island city. Aubet concludes: > \\"The structure of the cemetery at Tyre is in some ways reminiscent of the > European urnfields, in which apparently little formal differentiation > according to the sex, age, and content of the burials can be seen, although > their structure in fact conceals genuine social asymmetries. [..] Rather > than an 'egalitarian' society for Tyre, we should probably speak of an > egalitarian ideology, appropriate to a wholly urban and sophisticated > society, characterized by the relative simplicity and lack of ostentation of > its funeral customs. A communal ideology that concealed differences of > wealth and power is evident. [..] with only limited evidence of social > stratification, such a conclusion should be regarded as tentative and > subject to refinement on the basis of further and future excavations at > Tyre.\\" = Hellenistic times = Illustration of Alexander's siege by the United States Military Academy In 332 BCE, Alexander the Great had an isthmus of about 1.000 meters length constructed in 332 BCE to breach the fortications of offshore-Tyre. This causeway increased greatly in width because of extensive silt depositions on either side over the centuries. The growing tombolo linked the original island permanently to the adjacent continent and made the city a peninsula. As a consequence of this man-made metamorphosis of the Tyrian coastal system, the Phoenician graves in El Buss were buried under sediments of clay and sand. After almost two and a half millennia, they are now at more than 3.5 m under the ground level of El Buss. Before the landscape changed though, the Phoenician funerary site of El Buss was still used during the Hellenistic era. In addition, the area just neighbouring to the North, now known as Jal Al Bahr, became a burial ground, as recent excavations have shown. To the South of it, a sanctuary dedicated to the Olympian deity of Apollo was constructed at the end of the Hellenistic era. = Roman times = The reconstructed Triumphal Arch with the refugee camp in the back In 64 BCE the area of \\"Syria\\" finally became a province of the late Roman Republic, which was itself about to become the Roman Empire. Tyre was allowed to keep much of its independence as a \\"civitas foederata\\".

According to many believers in later centuries, he sat down on a rock in the Southern part of El Buss and had a meal there. Scientifc analyses from archaelogical excavations indicate that an olive grove planted was inside the Roman necropolis at the beginning of the Christian era. Face relief on a sarcophagus In the early second century CE, Emperor Hadrian, who visited the cities of the East around 130 CE, conferred the title of Metropolis on Tyre: \\"great city\\" mother of other cities. Subsequently, a triple-bay Triumphal Arch, an aqueduct from the springs of Ras al-Ain some six kilometers to the South and the Tyre Hippodrome were constructed. The arch was 21 meters high and became the gateway of the Roman town. At its side pillars were erected that were more than four meters high and carried the water canal alongside the road into the town on the peninsula. The hippodrome is the largest (480m long and 160m wide) and best- preserved Roman hippodrome after the one in Rome. The amphitheater for the horse-racetrack could host some 30.000 spectators. During the third century CE, the Heraclia games – dedicated to the deity Melqart-Heracles (not to be confused with the demigod Heracles, hero of the 12 labors) – were held in the hippodrome every four years. Meanwhile, between the first and fourth centuries CE, one of the largest known cemeteries of the region grew in El Buss with more than forty tomb complexes, at least 825 graves and the physical remains of almost 4,000 individuals. The marble sarcophagi, which were imported from Greece and Asia Minor, and the other tombs of the monumental necropolis spread on both sides of the road leading to the triumphal arch over a kilometer in length. It is unclear how far the burial grounds extended, but researchers argue that large parts of the modern camp could well have been part of the necropolis. Whereas the Phoenician funeral practices of an egalitarian ideology concealed social differences, the Roman graves did the opposite: > \\"The tombs of Tyre [..] demonstrate that the coming of Rome was not just a > new economic and military reality but also caused social and cultural > changes, which were acted out in part in the cemetery. [..] Through the > display of socioeconomic position and civic and group identity, the tombs > played an important and new role in the definition of social groups, and > perhaps in the renegotiation of the boundaries of these groups. = Byzantine period (395–640) = Mary fresco at the National Museum of Beirut In 395 Tyre became part of the Byzantine Empire and continued to flourish. Likewise, the necropolis in El Bus grew further to be arguably one of the largest in the world, though many graves were \\"reused\\". A main road of some 400m length and 4,5m width paved with limestone was constructed there during Byzantine times. Another arch, smaller than the Roman triumphal arch, was erected some 315 meters to the East. At the entrance to the oldest monument in the El Buss site - the Apollo Shrine from the 1st century BCE - a fresco was found that has been dated to 440 CE and is \\"possibly the earliest image of the Virgin Mary\\" worldwide. Close by, two churches with marble decorations were built in the 5th and early 6th century CE respectively, when construction in ancient Tyre reached its zenith. Over the course of the 6th century CE, starting in 502, a series of earthquakes shattered the city and left it diminished. The worst one was the 551 Beirut earthquake. It was accompanied by a Tsunami and destroyed the Great Triumphal Arch in El Buss. In addition, the city and its population increasingly suffered during the 6th century from the political chaos that ensued when the Byzantine empire was torn apart by wars. The city remained under Byzantine control until it was captured by the Sassanian shah Khosrow II at the turn from the 6th to the 7th century CE, and then briefly regained until the Muslim conquest of the Levant, when in 640 it was taken by the Arab forces of the Rashidun Caliphate.  Medieval times  = Early Muslim period (640–1124) = As the bearers of Islam restored peace and order, Tyre soon prospered again and continued to do so during half a millennium of Caliphate rule. The Rashidun period only lasted until 661. It was followed by the Umayyad Caliphate (until 750) and the Abbasid Caliphate. In the course of the centuries, Islam spread and Arabic became the language of administration instead of Greek. Although some people reportedly continued to worship ancient cults, the necropolis of El Buss and the other installations there were abandoned still in the 7th century CE and quickly covered by sand dunes. At the end of the 11th century, Tyre avoided being attacked by paying tribute to the Crusaders who marched on Jerusalem. However, in late 1111, King Baldwin I of Jerusalem laid siege on the former island city and probably occupied the mainland, including El Buss, for that purpose. Tyre in response put itself under the protection of the Seljuk military leader Toghtekin. Supported by Fatimid forces, he intervened and forced the Franks to raise the siege in April 1112, after about 2.000 of Baldwin's troops had been killed. A decade later, the Fatimids sold Tyre to Toghtekin who installed a garrison there. = Crusader period (1124–1291) = Graffiti in the Savior Church On 7 July 1124, in the aftermath of the First Crusade, Tyre was the last city to be eventually conquered by the Christian warriors, a Frankish army on the coast - i.e. also in the El Buss area - and a fleet of the Venetian Crusade from the sea side. The takeover followed a siege of five and a half months that caused great suffering from hunger to the population. Eventually, Tyre's Seljuk ruler Toghtekin negotiated an agreement for surrender with the authorities of the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem. Drawing of the aqueduct ruins in El Buss around 1786 Under its new rulers, Tyre and its countryside - including El-Buss - were divided into three parts in accordance with the Pactum Warmundi: two-thirds to the royal domain of Baldwin and one third as autonomous trading colonies for the Italian merchant cities of Genoa, Pisa and - mainly to the Doge of Venice. He had a particular interest in supplying silica sands to the glassmakers of Venice and so it may be assumed that El Buss fell into his interest sphere. It has to be assumed that at least the Southern part of El Buss was populated, since the Savior Church was built during the crusaders era in a place of the former hippodrome where Jesus supposedly sat down on a rock and had a meal. Hundreds of pilgrims left their signatures on its walls.  Mamluk period (1291–1516)  In 1291, Tyre was again taken, this time by the Mamluk Sultanate's army of Al-Ashraf Khalil. He had all fortifications demolished to prevent the Franks from re-entrenching. After Khalil's death in 1293 and political instability, Tyre lost its importance and \\"sank into obsurity.\\" When the Moroccan explorer Ibn Batutah visited Tyre in 1355, he found it a mass of ruins. Many stones were taken to neighbouring cities like Sidon, Acre, Beirut, and Jaffa as building materials. It may be assumed that this was true for the ancient ruins of El Buss, especially the Roman-Byzantine necropolis, aquaeduct and hippodrome as well, as far as they had not been buried underneath sand dunes alreay. The aquaeduct became the \\"lone witness to the city’s glorious past.\\" = Modern history =  Ottoman rule (1516-1918)  1878 SWP map showing Birket el Bass The Ottoman Empire conquered the Levant in 1516, yet Tyre remained untouched for another ninety years until the beginning of the 17th century, when the Ottoman leadership at the Sublime Porte appointed the Druze leader Fakhreddine II of the Maan family as Emir to administer Jabal Amel (modern-day South Lebanon) and Galilee in addition to the districts of Beirut and Sidon. It is not known whether the area of El Buss was part of his development projects. However, as he encouraged Shiites and Christians to settle to the East of Tyre, Fakhreddine laid the foundation of modern Tyre demographics as many of those settlers – or their descendants respectively – later moved to the town, thus providing the socio-political context for the subsequent erection of El Buss camp. In 1764, the French geographer Jacques Nicolas Bellin published a map of Greater Tyre which included the ruins of the aquaeduct in El Buss, but no settlements. Around 1786, Bellin's fellow countryman Louis-François Cassas visited the place and drew a painting of the ruins of the aquaeduct. In 1878, the London-based Palestine Exploration Fund's Survey of Western Palestine (SWP) – led by Herbert Kitchener at the beginning of his military career – mapped Tyre and its surroundings. It described the area of Birket el Bass – north of the aquaeduct – as a \\"ruined birket\\" (water reservoir or pool) and as \\"dry.\\" A map from a 1906 Baedeker travel guide designated the area as a \\"Swamp\\" though.  French Mandate colonial rule (1920–1943)  1906 map with El Buss as a swamp On the first of September 1920, the French colonial rulers proclaimed the new State of Greater Lebanon under the guardianship of the League of Nations represented by France. Tyre and the Jabal Amel were attached as the Southern part of the Mandate. The French High Commissioner in Syria and Lebanon became General Henri Gouraud. In 1932, the colonial authorities offered a piece of land of some 30,000 square meters in El Buss to the Jabal Amel Ulama Society of Shia clerics and feudal landlords to construct a school there. However, such plans were not realised due to internal divisions of the local power players and a few years later the French rulers attributed the swampy area to survivors of the Armenian Genocide, who had started arriving in Tyre already in the early 1920s, mostly by boat. A branch of the Armenian General Benevolent Union had been founded there in 1928. Saint Paul's church It is unclear when exactly the camp for Armenian refugees was set up. According to some sources it was in 1935–36, when also another camp was built in Rashidieh on the coast, five kilometres south of Tyre city. However, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) states that El Buss camp was constructed in 1937, whereas the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN HABITAT) dates it to 1939. During the following years - neither the exact dates are known nor the Christian denominations - an Armenian chapel and a church were constructed in El Buss camp. The defunct chapel is nowadays part of an UNRWA school building, while the church of Saint Paul belongs to the Maronite Catholic Archeparchy of Tyre and is still in service. On 8 June 1941, a joint British-Free French Syria–Lebanon campaign liberated Tyre from the Nazi-collaborators of Marshal Philippe Pétain's Vichy regime.  Post- Independence (since 1943)  Libanon gained independence from French colonial rule on 22 November 1943. The Maronite political leader Émile Eddé – a former Prime Minister and President – reportedly suggested to the Zionist leader Chaim Weizmann that a Christian Lebanon > \\"should relinquish some portions of the no longer wanted territory, but to > the Jewish state-in-the-making. It could have Tyre and Sidon and the 100,000 > Muslims living there, but when he put the matter to Weizmann, even he balked > at what he called a gift which bites'.\\" = 1948/9 Palestinian exodous = When the state of Israel was declared in May 1948, Tyre was immediately affected: with the Palestinian exodus – also known as the Nakba' – thousands of Palestinian refugees fled to the city, often by boat. El-Buss was one of the first sites which was assigned to the Palestinian refugees as a transit camp. The majority of the first wave of Palestinians who arrived in El-Buss were Palestinian Christians from Haifa and Akka. Most of them only found shelter in tents there. Soon the camp was overcrowded and more camps were set up in other parts of the country. Initially, Armenians and Palestinians cohabited in the camp. In the course of the 1950s, the Armenian refugees from El Buss were resettled to the Anjar area, while Palestinians from the Acre area in Galilee moved into the camp. Many of them were apparently agriculturalists. Before UNRWA opened its first school in El Buss, children received education under the roof of the church or chapel. Fedayeen at a rally in Beirut, 1979 In 1957, large-scale excavations of the Roman-Byzantine necropolis in El Buss started under the leadership of Emir Maurice Chéhab (1904-1994), \\"the father of modern Lebanese archaeology\\" who for decades headed the Antiquities Service in Lebanon and was the curator of the National Museum of Beirut. The works stopped in 1967 and because of the political turmoil that followed Chehab could not take them up again. Publication of his research materials was never completed either. The whereabouts of most of the finds and the excavation documentation are unknown. In 1965, residents of El Buss gained access to electricity. After the Six-Day War of June 1967 another wave of displaced Palestinians sought refuge in South Lebanon. In the following year, El Buss camp had 3,911 registered inhabitants. As Tyre greatly expanded during the 1960s due to an increasing a rural-to- urban movement and many new buildings were constructed on the isthmus of the peninsula, El Buss became physically more integrated into the city. The solidarity of the Lebanese Tyrians with the Palestinians was especially demonstrated in January 1969 through a general strike to demand the repulsion of Israeli attacks on Palestinian targets in Beirut. At the same time though, the arrival of civilian refugees went along with an increasingly strong presence of Palestinian Militants. Thus, clashes between Palestinians and Israel increased dramatically: On 12 May 1970, the IDF launched a number of attacks in South Lebanon, including Tyre. The Palestinian insurgency in South Lebanon escalated further after the conflict of Black September 1970 between the Jordanian Armed Forces (JAF) and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). The PLO leadership under Yasir Arafat relocated to Lebanon, where it essentially created a state within a state and recruited young fighters - known as fedayeen - in the refugee camps. The 1973 October Yom Kippur War signalled even more Palestinian military operations from Southern Lebanese territory, including Tyre, which in turn increasingly sparked Israeli retaliation. In the following year, the Iran-born Shiite cleric Sayed Musa Sadr who had become the Shia Imam of Tyre in 1959, founded Harakat al- Mahroumin (\\"Movement of the Deprived\\") and one year later – shortly before the beginning of the Lebanese Civil War – its de facto military wing: Afwaj al- Muqawama al-Lubnaniyya (Amal). Military training and weaponry for its fighters was inititally provided by Arafat's PLO-faction Fatah, but Sadr increasingly distanced himself from them as the situation escalated into a civil war: =Lebanese Civil War (1975-1990)= In January 1975, a unit of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) attacked the Tyre barracks of the Lebanese Army. The assault was denounced by the PLO as \\"a premeditated and reckless act\\". However, two months later, a PLO commando of eight militants sailed from the coast of Tyre to Tel Aviv to mount the Savoy Hotel attack, during which eight civilian Hostages and three Israeli soldiers were killed as well as seven of the attackers. Israel retaliated by launching a string of attacks on Tyre \\"from land, sea and air\\" in August and September 1975. Then, in 1976, local commanders of the PLO took over the municipal government of Tyre with support from their allies of the Lebanese Arab Army. They occupied the army barracks, set up roadblocks and started collecting customs at the port. However, the new rulers quickly lost support from the Lebanese-Tyrian population because of their \\"arbitrary and often brutal behavior\\". By 1977, the UNRWA census put the population of El Buss camp at 4,643. As their situation deteriorated, emigration to Europe increased. At first, a group of graduates went to what was then West-Berlin, because entry via East-Berlin did not require travel visa. Many settled there or in what was then West-Germany: > \\"They concentrated on working in the catering and the construction sectors. > They still, however, maintained close connections with their country of > departure by sending money to their families remaining in Lebanon. When they > acquired German citizenship or valid residence permits they were able to > visit their families in Lebanon. Afterwards, as their savings grew, they > were able to facilitate the arrival of close relatives (e.g., brother, > parent, sister). In many cases, their integration into German society was > further enhanced by marriage with Germans.\\" At the same time, most of the Christian population gradually moved out of the camp. Allegedly, many of them were granted Lebanese citizenship by the Maronite ruling class in a demographic attempt to compensate for the many Lebanese Christians who emigrated.  1978 South Lebanon conflict with Israel  On 11 March 1978, Dalal Mughrabi – a young woman from the Palestinian refugee camp of Sabra in Beirut – and a dozen Palestinian fedayeen fighter sailed from Tyre to a beach north of Tel Aviv. Their attacks on civilian targets became known as the Coastal Road massacre that killed 38 Israeli civilians, including 13 children, and wounded 71. According to the United Nations, the > PLO \\"claimed responsibility for that raid. In response, Israeli forces > invaded Lebanon on the night of 14/15 March, and in a few days occupied the > entire southern part of the country except for the city of Tyre and its > surrounding area.\\" Nevertheless, Tyre was badly affected in the fighting during the Operation Litani. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) targeted especially the harbour on claims that the PLO received arms from there and the Palestinian refugee camps. El Buss suffered extensive damage from Israeli air and navy attacks. > \\"On 15 March 1978, the Lebanese Government submitted a strong protest to the > Security Council against the Israeli invasion, stating that it had no > connection with the Palestinian commando operation. On 19 March, the Council > adopted resolutions 425 (1978) and 426 (1978), in which it called upon > Israel immediately to cease its military action and withdraw its forces from > all Lebanese territory. It also decided on the immediate establishment of > the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL). The first UNIFIL > troops arrived in the area on 23 March 1978.\\" However, the Palestinian forces were unwilling to give up their positions in and around Tyre. UNIFIL was unable to expel those militants and sustained heavy casualties. It therefore accepted an enclave of Palestinian fighters in its area of operation which was dubbed the \\"Tyre Pocket\\". In effect, the PLO kept ruling Tyre with its Lebanese allies of the National Lebanese Movement (NLM), which was in disarray though after the 1977 assassination of its leader Kamal Jumblatt. Frequent IDF bombardments of Tyre from ground, sea and air raids continued after 1978. In January 1979, Israel started naval attacks on the city. The PLO reportedly converted itself into a regular army by purchasing large weapon systems, including Soviet WWII-era T-34 tanks, which it deployed in the \\"Tyre Pocket\\" with an estimated 1,500 fighters. On the 27th April 1981, the Irish UNIFIL-soldier Kevin Joyce got kidnapped by a Palestinian faction from his observation post near the village of Dyar Ntar and, \\"according to UN intelligence reports, was taken to a Palestinian refugee camp in Tyre. He was shot dead a few weeks later following a gun battle between Palestinians and UN soldiers in south Lebanon.\\" The PLO kept shelling into Galilee until a cease-fire in July 1981. On the 23rd of that month, the IDF had bombed Tyre. As discontent within the Shiite population about the suffering from the conflict between Israel and the Palestinian factions grew, so did tensions between Amal and the Palestinian militants. The power struggle was exacerbated by the fact that the PLO supported Saddam Hussein's camp during the Iraq-Iran-War, whereas Amal sided with Teheran. Eventually, the political polarisation between the former allies escalated into violent clashes in many villages of Southern Lebanon, including the Tyre area.  1982 Israeli invasion  Following an assassination attempt on Israeli ambassador Shlomo Argov in London the IDF started an invasion of Lebanon on 6 June 1982, which heavily afflicted Tyre once again: Shelling by Israeli artillery and air raids killed some 80 people on the first day across the city. The Palestinian camps were bearing the brunt of the assault, as many guerillas fought till the end. Though El Buss was less affected than other camps, a contemporary United Nations report found that half of the houses in the camp were either badly damaged or destroyed during the nvasion. The Advisory Committee on Human Rights of the American Friends Service Committee termed the destruction of homes in El-Buss \\"systematic\\". As a consquence, the drive to emigrate from El-Buss increased further: > \\"Some of the refugees, in particular those who were injured or whose > dwellings were completely destroyed, sought to leave Lebanon indefinitely. > Connection between internal migration and international migration was > effected at that time. Denmark and Sweden agreed to accept these refugees. > Germany too continued to receive some of them. The migratory field thus > extended to new countries further north, whilst Germany, the previous > principal recipient country, now became primarily a country of transit > towards Scandinavia.\\" In 1984, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) declared Tyre, including el Buss, a World Heritage Site in an attempt to halt the damage being done to the archaeological sites by the armed conflict and by anarchic urban development.  1985-1988 War of the Camps: Amal vs. PLO  Berri (right) and Jumblatt in 1989 Under the growing pressure of suicide attacks by Hezbollah, the Israeli forces withdrew from Tyre by the end of April 1985 and instead established a self-declared \\"Security Zone\\" in Southern Lebanon with its collaborating militia allies of the South Lebanon Army (SLA). Tyre was left outside the SLA control though and taken over by the Amal Movement under the leadership of Nabih Berri: > \\"The priority of Amal remained to prevent the return of any armed > Palestinian presence to the South, primarily because this might provoke > renewed Israeli intervention in recently evacuated areas. The approximately > 60,000 Palestinian refugees in the camps around Tyre (al-Bass, Rashidiya, > Burj al-Shimali) were cut off from the outside world, although Amal never > succeeded in fully controlling the camps themselves. In the Sunni 'canton' > of Sidon, the armed PLO returned in force.\\" Tensions between Amal and Palestinian militants soon escalated once again and eventually exploded into the War of the Camps, which is considered as \\"one of the most brutal episodes in a brutal civil war\\": In September 1986, a group of Palestinians fired on an Amal patrol at Rashidieh. After one month of siege, Amal attacked the refugee camp in the South of Tyre. It was reportedly assisted by the Progressive Socialist Party of Druze leader Walid Jumblatt, whose father Kamal had entered into and then broken an alliance with Amal- founder Musa Sadr, as well as by the pro-Syrian Palestinian militia As-Saiqa and the \\"Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine – General Command\\". Fighting spread and continued for one month. By that time some 7,000 refugees in the Tyre area were displaced once more: > \\"Amal [..] overran the unarmed camps of El Buss and Burj el-Shemali, burning > homes and taking more than a thousand men into custody.\\" At the same time, many Lebanese Shiite families who were displaced from the Israeli-occupied southern \\"security zone\\" started building an informal neighbourhood on the Western side next to the camp. Meanwhile, emigration for Palestinians from El Bus to Europe became increasingly difficult, since favourite destinations like Germany and Scandinavia adopted more restrictive asylum policies: > \\"A transnational field emerged with the circulation of information, and, to > a lesser extent, of people, between the Palestinians still residing in Al > Buss and those of Europe.\\" In the late 1980s, \\"clandestine excavations\\" took place in the Al-Bass cemetery which \\"flooded the antiquities market\\". In 1990, a necropolis from the Iron Age was discovered in El Buss \\"by chance\\". = Post-Civil War (since 1991) = Following the end of the war in March 1991 based on the Taif Agreement, units of the Lebanese Army deployed along the coastal highway and around the Palestinian refugee camps of Tyre, including El-Buss. The patterns of emigration changed through the 1990s, as European border regimes further tightened: > \\"The geographical extension of the migratory field widened and touched > countries such as the United Kingdom and Belgium. The three principal host > countries (Germany, Sweden, and Denmark) continued to play a central role in > this migratory system, but increasingly as transit countries.\\" At the end of the decade, UNRWA estimated the population to be 9,498. In 1997, Spanish-led archaeological excavations started at El-Buss. They were conducted for eleven years and exposed an area of some 500 square meter of cremation graves. In 2005 the Lebanese government abolitished long-standing limitations for residents of El Buss to add a storey to their house. After the lifting of such spatial restrictions the camp witnessed a densification in its buildings. During Israel's invasion in the July 2006 Lebanon War, El Buss was apparently less affected than other parts of Tyre, especially compared to the badly hit Burj El Shemali. However, at least one building close to the necropolis was hit by Israeli bombardments which also caused damage to a part of the frescoes of a Roman funerary cave. This may have been the area of the Maronite Saint Paul's church on the Eastern edge of the camp since a commemorative plaque threre notes that the religious building was damaged by Israeli air strikes on 12 July and later rebuilt with funding from the Emir of Qatar. When the Palestinian refugee camp of Nahr El Bared in northwestern Lebanon was largely destroyed in 2007 because of heavy fighting between the Lebanese Army and the militant Sunni Islamist group Fatah al-Islam, some of its residents fled to El Buss. In 2007/8, fresh water, wastewater, and stormwater systems were rehabilitated, apparently by UNRWA. Until then, the sewage networks in el Buss were above the ground. While the quality of life was improved by those measures, it may be argued that they were also > \\"affirming these structures’ permanence within a broader context of > suspended time.\\" In September 2010, three people were reportedly wounded after a dispute between clerics loyal to either Fatah or Hamas resulted in armed clashes. A study by the German leftwing Rosa Luxemburg Foundation found that while Fatah is the leading faction in the camp and thus dominates the ruling Popular Committee, a host of other parties have supporters there as well, both secular and religious ones. Apart from Hamas they are the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP), the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), the Palestinian People's Party, the Palestinian Liberation Front (PLF), the Arab Liberation Front (ALF), the al-Nidal Front, the Islamic Jihad Movement, the Shabiha-militia, Ansar Allah and the al-Tahrir party. According to UN estimates, more than 500 refugees who fled from the Syrian civil war settled in El Buss. Low-cost housing made El Buss a prime choice for them. Most were Palestinians who arrived soon after the beginning of the armed conflict in 2012, adding > \\"another dimension of precarity to life in the camp\\". As of June 2018, there were 12,281 registered refugees in the El Buss camp, though this does not necessarily represent the actual number as many have left over the years, Northern Europe, and UNRWA does not track them. In fact, > \\"the camp is not very lively; most of its people live abroad\\".  Economy  According to a 2016 study by UN HABITAT, residents of El-Buss mainly work in construction and other technical jobs, particularly in the metal workshops along its Northern side. In addition, many men work as day labourers in seasonal agriculture, mainly in the citrus plantations of the Greater Tyre plains area. However, levels of unemployment are high. > \\"Emigration and a desire to escape the confines of the camp pervade life in > El-Buss. It is a topic that occupies most conversations and is the ultimate > goal of the youth that live in the camp.\\" The French anthropologist Sylvain Perdigon – who lived in the El Buss camp in 2006/2007 and has been a lecturer at the American University of Beirut (AUB) since 2013 – found through his fieldwork that these precarious labor conditions make emigration the only “thinkable, desirable route” away from a dead-end future for many residents. According to his findings, the preferred destination for them is Germany.  Education  UNRWA’s Al Chajra middle school in El-Bass camp provides education for up to 900 students. There are three other schools as well and about five kindergartens. While some children attend educational institutions outside of the camp, others who live outside the camp commute to el Buss to go to school there. In August 2019, the 17-year-old Ismail Ajjawi – a Palestinian graduate of the UNRWA Deir Yassin High School in El Buss – made global headlines when he scored top-results to earn a scholarship to study at Harvard, but was deported upon arrival in Boston despite valid visa. He was readmitted ten days later to start his studies in time.  Health care  El Buss is considered unique among the twelve Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon in that there is a Lebanese public hospital within its boundaries. Located at its Eastern edge, it was reportedly constructed before 1948 and has been used mostly by Lebanese patients, especially members of the military forces. There is also a clinic operated by UNRWA, and medical laboratory for essential tests, including an X-Ray machine. Some non-governmental organisations, both local and international ones, offer health services, for instance helping children with disabilities.  Cultural life  The Maronite church of Saint Paul in El Buss El Buss is also considered to be unique among the Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon that it hosts the Maronite church of Saint Paul, which is attended both by Palestinian and Lebanese Christians. This fact, along with the Lebanese public hospital, has been said to contribute to a higher degree of integration between Lebanese and Palestinians. The number of houses inhabited by Palestinian Christians, which reportedly used to be around 40 percent of the population in El Buss during earlier years, was apparently down to about 15 by 2011 though. There is apparently still a tiny number of Armenians living in the camp as well. The most common mural in El Buss though is the Palestinian flag, in contrast to the flags of Amal and Hezbollah which dominate the visual-spatial landscape in Tyre. Also omnipresent in the public sphere of the camp are images of the late PLO leader Arafat and of Palestinian fighers killed in the armed resistance against the occupation as martyrs, usually combined with pictures of the Dome of the Rock in JerusalemOther common themes dealing with Palestinian identity are spray-painted images depicting narratives about the traumatic displacement events of the Nakba and life in the diaspora. Some feature Handala, the iconic symbol of Palestinian defiance created by cartoonist Naji al-Ali, who worked as a drawing instructor at Tyre's Jafariya School during the 1960s. The El Buss necropolis in the foreground with buildings of the camp in the background Perdigon has researched another kind of a cultural phenomenon that he describes as \\"fairly ordinary\\" amongst many Palestianians in Lebanon, especially in El Buss and Rashidieh, which happens to be an ancient burial site as well. This phenomenon - which is known as Al Qreene - haunts people in their dreams through different forms, interrupts their lives and is especially feared for causing miscarriages. Perdigon lays out one exemplary case from El Buss: > \\"Lamis, my 45-year-old neighbor and landlady when I was living in al-Bass, > had an especially long and painful engagement with al-Qreene [..]. Lamis’s > mother 'had her' (i.e., al-Qreene) when she gave birth to her. Were it not > for her vigilance at the time, Lamis 'would not have lived' (gheyro ma > be’ish), although the price to pay was that she 'carried' al-Qreene from her > mother (ijat menha iley . . . hemelet al-Qreene). Lamis started to directly > confront al-Qreene herself at the onset of her first pregnancy. She lost > four unborn children over the years to the frightful entity, who burst in on > the scene of her dreams alternatively as an ugly old woman' and a mob of > militiamen.

Paul Buissière, 1730s portrait Life Buissière was a Huguenot, who practised in the principality of Orange before emigrating first to Copenhagen. He was naturalised in England on 10 October 1688, and built a reputation as a practitioner in Suffolk Street, Pall Mall, London. He was the surgeon who attended the leading statesman Robert Harley when he was stabbed at the Council table by the double agent Antoine de Guiscard, in March 1711; he also attended the assassin after his committal to Newgate Prison. Many years later he was consulted on the last illness of Queen Caroline of Ansbach in November 1737. He was then thought to be at least 80 years old, but was still regarded as the finest physician in London. Buissière was one of the first to introduce a course of lectures on anatomy and physiology into England. He had been admitted a foreign member of the Royal Society on 22 May 1700, and was placed on the home list in 1713, and chosen one of the council in 1719. Buissière died at his house in Suffolk Street in January 1739, and left money to the French Hospital in London, of which he had been elected governor in 1729.See also Murdoch, Tessa, and Randolph Vigne (2009), The French Hospital in England: Its Huguenot History and Collections. Cambridge: John Adamson . Buissière had been elected a director of the hospital in 1719. He was the first governor of the hospital who had not been a founding director in 1718. Works Buissière wrote: * Lettre à M. Bourdelin pour servir de réponse au sieur Méry sur l'Usage du Trou ovale dans le Fœtus, Paris, 1700. * Nouvelle Déscription anatomique du Cœur des Tortues terrestres de l'Amérique et de ses Vaisseaux, Paris, 1713. He contributed six papers on anatomical subjects to Philosophical Transactions. Other papers were in the Mémoires of the Academy of Sciences of Paris, of which he became a corresponding member in March 1699, and in the Acta Eruditorum. He also maintained a scientific correspondence with Sir Hans Sloane, which went to the archives of the Royal Society.

This mountainous park features waterfalls, scenic viewpoints, and a seasonal flower field. Geography Sai Thong National Park is about west of Chaiyaphum town in the Nong Bua Rawe, Thep Sathit, Phakdi Chumphon and Nong Bua Daeng Districts of Chaiyaphum Province. The park's area is . The park is in the Phang Hoei mountain range and the park's highest point is Khao Phang Hoei at . Numerous tributaries of the Chi River have their source within the park's boundaries. The park's forest types consist of mixed deciduous, dipterocarp and dry evergreen forest. Siam tulip Previous inhabitants Shortly after Sai Thong was established in 1992, the forest dwellers who had lived there before the park was created, had their dwellings and lands annexed by the park. Indigenous forest dwellers, whose forebears were living in the area before Thailand came into being, were deemed criminals subject to imprisonment. More than 10 million persons in some 2,700 forest communities across Thailand face eviction and legal sanctions. More than 7,000 villagers are sent to jail each year for park encroachment. Forest evictions, often violent, have increased following the 2014 Thai coup d'état under the junta's \\"forest reclaiming\\" policy. The current (2019) national park law that criminalizes forest dwellers will soon be replaced by a new version that is even more oppressive. The new law gives forest officials the power to summon people for questioning and to enter their homes at any time. They will be empowered to destroy dwellings in the forest at will. Penalties will include jail sentences of up to 20 years and maximum fines of two million baht. In 2018, 14 cassava-growing peasants, nine of them women, were found guilty by a lower court of encroaching on Sai Thong National Park after forestry authorities filed complaints against the villagers for refusing to leave. The villagers were ordered to pay compensation fees for environmental degradation ranging from 40,000 to 1.58 million baht (US$1,300-51,000) for 1 to 48 rai (0.16-7.7 hectares) of land use. Those charged with refusing to leave had settled there in the 1970s, before the national park was established in 1992.

Geoffrey Drage (17 August 1860 – 7 March 1955) was an English writer and Conservative Party politician. He was concerned particularly with the problems of the poor.  Early life and family  Drage was the son of Dr Charles Drage of Hatfield in Hertfordshire. He was educated at Eton and at Christ Church, Oxford, where he graduated in 1883, before pursuing further studies in European universities including Berlin and Moscow. He was called to the bar at both Lincoln's Inn and the Middle Temple, but never practised as a barrister. In 1896 he married Ethel Sealby Ismay, the daughter of Thomas Henry Ismay who founded the White Star Line. They had two sons. Career Drage became a prolific writer and commentator of public affairs, particularly on poverty, labour relations and the training of sailors. From 1891 to 1894 he was secretary to the Royal Commission on labour relations. Drage was elected at the 1895 general election as one of the two members of parliament for (MP)s) for Derby. He and Sir Henry Howe Bemrose had unseated the town's two sitting Liberal MPs, including the Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir William Vernon Harcourt. The election was a nationwide rout for the Liberals, who lost a third of their seats in the House of Commons, but in a letter to The Times newspaper Drage attributed his success to his own campaigning efforts in Derby. In six months of campaigning he had addressed at least one meeting of working men every week, offering what he called \\"practical answers\\" to labour problems. He lost his seat at the next general election, in 1900 and never returned to Parliament. He contested Cleveland at the 1902 by-election,Craig, page 427 Woolwich at the 1903 by-election,Craig, page 60 Blackburn at the 1906 general election,Craig, page 76 but was unsuccessful in each case. In 1897 he was a member of the International Congress on Housing of the Working Classes, in Brussels, and in 1900 of the International Congress on Poor Law and Charity, in Paris. In 1906 he became President of the Central Poor Law Conference. From 1910 to 1919 he was an alderman of London County Council. During World War I he served from 1914 in the military intelligence section of the War Office. In 1923 Drage was at the centre of a huge anti-Semitic controversy because of an article he wrote for the Encyclopaedia Britannica about Poland. In a sub-section titled \\"The Jewish Question,\\" he made the following derogatory statements about the Jews: \\"The Eastern Jew is essentially a business or commercial man, but rarely a producer. He is usually a middleman or intermediary. In towns, the majority of the shops are owned by Jews, but they are a race apart, hated and despised by the rest of the population, devoted to their religion, which is a primitive type of Judaism.\\" “ . . . The Tsarist Government drove the Jews out of Russia, but gave them exceptional advantages in Poland. During and after the war the hostility to the Jews was increased by the fact that in the German occupation the Jew was the willing tool of the invader and by the close connection between the Jews and Bolshevism. The hostility to the Jew was marked in 1918 and 1919 by excesses in which some 200 or 300 have in fact been killed, but which have been enormously exaggerated by the Jewish Press.\\" \\"Captain Peter Wright, in his very valuable and interesting report, states that the great majority of the poor Jews are of the Eastern type and extreme orthodoxy (Chassidism). They form an immense mass of squalid and helpless poverty. They are driven into all sorts of illicit and fraudulent practices.\\" “They are unfit for the modern economic world for want of education and for Western society because of their habits and want of cleanliness.” According to The New York Times \\"The Jewish Tribune analyzes the article as to its authoritativeness, its impartiality, its accuracy, and concludes that none of these elements exists, adding, \\"we have shown that in its treatment of a vital question affecting millions of human beings the Encyclopaedia has violated the elementary principles of encyclopaedia compilation.”Sees Anti-Semitism In Encyclopaedia, The New York Times, pg 4, April 13, 1923.

It was published by Liberty Fund Inc., and first printed in 1924. Synopsis Babbitt criticizes what he calls the naturalistic movement in modern Western society. He distinguishes two aspects of this movement, letting Francis Bacon exemplify its mechanistic and utilitarian side and Jean- Jacques Rousseau its sentimental side. Both ignore the need to order human life with reference to a transcendent ethical principle. The utilitarian and sentimental dispositions are frequently joined in a single individual. According to Babbitt, no amount of sentimental “love” or sociopolitical activism can substitute for a lack of real moral character. The book rejects historical deterministic philosophies from Saint Augustine to Bossuet. It details political philosophy from Aristotle onwards, explaining how governmental philosophies have tried and failed over time. In the book, Babbitt provides a convincing critique of \\"unchecked majoritarianism,\\" while dealing with the issue of how to find leaders who have high standards. Recognition * \\"...one of the few truly important works of political thought.\\" —Russell Kirk * \\"Today, the wisdom of Babbitt's view is apparent.\\" —Joe Lee Davis Background Babbitt considered moral character so important that it could not be superseded by socio-political activism or sentimentality. In some cases, he believed social reform could be helpful, but never as a replacement for individual conscience. He explains: \\"With the present trend toward “social justice,” the time is rapidly approaching when everybody will be minding everybody else’s business. For the conscience that is felt as a still, small voice and that is the basis of real justice, we have substituted a social conscience that operates rather through a megaphone. The busybody, for the first time perhaps in the history of the world, has been taken at his own estimate of himself.\\"  References  External links * The full text of Democracy and Leadership at the Internet Archive * * The Birth of a Chinese Cultural Movement: Letters Between Babbitt and Wu Mi * What is “humanism\\"?

The rooms were later used by NATO and are now open to the public as a museum.  History  The British started work on the secret underground in 1940, during the siege of Malta, when a series of tunnels under the Upper Barrakka Gardens and the Saluting Battery that had been used as slave quarters during the Hospitaller period began to be expanded. The complex was completed in early 1943. The site takes its name from the nearby Lascaris Battery, which was itself named after Giovanni Paolo Lascaris, a Grandmaster who had built a garden on the site later occupied by the battery. The Lascaris War Rooms contained operations rooms for each of the fighting services, from where both the defence of Malta and other operations in the Mediterranean were coordinated. The Operation Headquarters at Lascaris communicated directly with radar stations around the Maltese islands, and it was equipped with Type X machines. The fleets were led from the Navy Plotting Room, while the Anti-Aircraft Guns Operations Room was responsible for the air defence of the island. In the Coast Defence Room, defensive operations in the case of an amphibious invasion were planned. The Filter Room displayed information received from various places, including the naval station at Auberge de Castille. Lascaris was the advance Allied HQ from where General Eisenhower and his Supreme Commanders Admiral Cunningham, Field Marshal Montgomery and Air Marshal Tedder directed the Allied invasion of Sicily (Operation Husky) in 1943. Throughout the war, around 1000 people worked in the rooms, including 240 soldiers. After the war, Lascaris became the Headquarters of the Royal Navy's Mediterranean Fleet. They played an active part during the Suez Crisis of 1956, and were put into full alert during the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, when a Soviet missile strike against Malta was feared. In 1967, the complex was taken over by NATO to be used as a strategic Communication Centre for the interception of Soviet submarines in the Mediterranean. The war rooms continued to serve this function until they were closed down in 1977.  Present day  The complex was leased to a private venture in 1992, and it was refurbished and open to the public. The rooms closed down in 2005, but were acquired by Fondazzjoni Wirt Artna and the Malta Heritage Trust in 2009 and are once again open to the public. Restoration began soon after, and it is nearly complete. When ready, it is planned that the rooms will form part of a Military Heritage Park, including both the war rooms and the NATO Command Centre, as well as the SS Peter and Paul Counterguard, the Saluting Battery, and the crypt of the former Garrison Chapel.

Sometimes, she is described a rakshasi (demoness), at other times, she is said to have gandharva (celestial dancers) lineage. All accounts agree that Sarama was friendly to Sita, the consort of Rama (the prince of Ayodhya and an avatar of the god Vishnu), who was kidnapped by Ravana and imprisoned in Lanka. Like her husband who sides with Rama in the war against Ravana, Sarama is kind to Sita and aids Rama. Sarama and Vibhishana had a daughter called Trijata. Relation with Sita According to Camille Bulcke (an expert on Rama-centric literature), Sarama does not appear in the original Ramayana. However, later interpolations - present in all recensions - added to the text of Valmiki mention her. She first appears in the episode of Maya-shirsa, the illusory head of Rama. Ravana has abducted Sita, the wife of Rama, the prince of Ayodhya and repeatedly urges her to marry him, however Sita flatly refuses each time. After Rama with his monkey (vanara) army lands on Lanka, Ravana asks his magician Vidyujihva to create an illusory severed head of Rama and his bow to convince Sita of Rama's death. The magician complies and presents the head and bow to Sita in the Ashoka Vatika, where she is imprisoned. Sita laments in presence of Ravana seeing the head of her \\"dead\\" husband. Soon, Ravana leaves for a meeting with his ministers and the head and the bow disappear after his departure. Sarama comes close to Sita and exposes Ravana's trickery to Sita. She says that she secretly witnessed the trick of Ravana and the head was just a product of magic. She also informs Sita that Rama has arrived in Lanka with his monkey- army headed by Sugriva and she has seen Rama with her own eyes. She asks Sita if she can pass on any message to Rama on Sita's behalf. Sita instead requests Sarama to probe the plans Ravana had for her. Sarama finds out and informs Sita that despite the advice of his mother and wise aged ministers, Ravana refused to hand over Sita to Rama. Sarama is described as \\"lovely companion\\" and friend of Sita.Bulcke pp. 105-6 The Northern recension adds another episode about Sarama. An canto called Sarama-vakyam (\\"conversation with Sarama\\") narrates how Sarama informs Sita about the burning of Lanka by Rama's monkey general Hanuman. This episode appears before Rama comes to Lanka, when he had sent Hanuman to locate where the kidnapped Sita is.Bulcke p. 106 Association with Vibhishana Vibhishana depicted with his consort Sarama. Neither in the illusory head scene or the Sarama-vakyam indicate any relationship between Sarama and Vibhishana. The only mention of the unnamed Vibhishana's wife is when Sita mentions about her to Hanuman, where he tracks her in Lanka and meets her. Sita tells him that the wife of Vibhishana - who sides with Rama in the war - sent her daughter Kala (In other recensions of the Ramayana, called Nanda or Anala) to give information of Ravana's intentions about not surrendering Sita to Rama, despite the advice of Vibhishana and Ravana's old and wise minister Avindhya.Bulcke pp. 106-7 Four benefactors of Sita emerge in the Ramayana - the unnamed Vibhisana's wife, Kala, Trijata and Sarama. Over time in later Rama-centric literature, Sarama was identified as Vibhishana's wife while Trijata was regarded his daughter. Sarama's identification with Vibhishana's wife is introduced quite early, in the Uttra Kanda, the last Book of the Ramayana itself, which is regarded as a later addition to the original text. It mentions that Ravana obtained Sarama, the daughter of the gandharva Sailusa, to be his brother Vibhishana's wife.Venkatesananda p. 358 Sarama was born on the banks of the Manas Lake. Seeing the waters of the lake rise, the infant started crying. Her mother commanded the lake, Saroma vardhata (\\"Lake, do not rise\\"), so the child was named Sarama.Bulcke p. 107 Post-Ramayana literature In post-Ramayana literature, Trijata, the daughter of Sarama and Vibhishana, acquires a greater role. In some adaptions, she replaces Sarama in both episodes attributed to her mother in the original epic.Bulcke p. 108 However, the Krittivasi Ramayana portrays Trijata in bad light appealing to Sita to wed Ravana and rule as the queen of Lanka. This Bengali adaptation emphasizes on friendship of Sarama and Sita. In a playful pun, Sita tells Sarama, \\"I am Rama, and thus, you are called Sarama, because of me\\".Bulcke p. 110 The Ranganatha Ramayana and the Tattvasamgraha Ramayana credit Sarama as the one who points the location of the yajna, which would have made Ravana invincible, to the monkey army of Rama so they can destroy it.Nagar p. 407 The Ananda Ramayana narrates that after Rama's victory in the war over Ravana both Sarama and Trijata went to Ayodhya in the Pushpaka vimana, Ravana's aerial chariot. Later, when Sita visits Lanka, she says to Sarama to treat Trijata like she is Sita.Bulcke p. 109 In the Telugu Sita Puranamu, Ramaswami Chaudari portrays Sarama negatively as the Aryan (gandharva) wife of the Dravidian Vibhishana, who sways her husband's opinion towards Rama and forces him to betray his just brother Ravana.

The proposed Kaliwa Low Dam design had a 600 million-liters-a-day (MLD) capacity, and the water supply tunnel has a 2,400-MLD capacity. Had it been built, the Kaliwa Low Dam was expected to ease the demand on the Angat Dam, Manila’s sole water storage facility. It was the main component of the New Centennial Water Source-Kaliwa Dam Project in Tanay, Rizal, which also called for the construction of a water supply tunnel and various attendant infrastructure. The project had originally been proposed as a bigger, integrated system which included a plan for a second dam, named Laiban dam further upstream. But the government decided on a proposal which would have built the system in stages, and only stage one, involving Kaliwa Low Dam and the water supply tunnel, was approved under the administration of Benigno Aquino III. When the project did not move forward by the time Aquino administration ended, the succeeding Duterte administration decided not to pursue the Japanese-proposed Kaliwa Low Dam plan and instead pursued a bigger, China-funded dam project.  Earlier Projects at the Laiban Watershed  Various plans for the construction of a dam in Tanay, Rizal, have been proposed since the 1970s, when the Marcos government first decided that the location was a more viable location for a dam than the Marikina River. However, protests against the construction of the dam, called Laiban because Barangay Laiban was chosen as the exact project site, very quickly led to protests from various groups. Foremost among these were indigenous peoples from Central and Southern Luzon, notably the local Remontado Dumagat people, whose ancestral lands would specifically be affected. Environmental and activist groups later also raised concerns. As a result, construction of the dam has been approved, deferred, stopped, and restarted a number of times in the decades since. Project approval process = Original Proposal, including Laiban Dam and Power Plant = The roots of the current \\"New Centennial Water Source Project\\" can be traced to the Water Security Legacy (WSL) Roadmap proposed by the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS) in 2012-2016. Based on this document, the MWSS developed plans for \\"the development of a dam at the Kaliwa River (Laiban Dam), and/or a smaller dam downstream (Kaliwa Low Dam) to maximize water supply, ensure short - and long - term redundancy, and optimize power generation capacities,\\" and in February 2013, the Public Private Partnership Center released a document \\"sounding out\\" interested parties. In that initial market sounding, this proposal was already thought likely to comprise: #) Laiban Dam and/or Kaliwa Low Dam; #) Head works and its appurtenant facilities; #) Conveyance structure from the diversion point to the water treatment facility(s); #) Water treatment facility(s); and #) Hydropower facility(s). In report by Philippine Daily Inquirer reporter Niña Calleja in that same month, MWSS senior deputy administrator Nathaniel Santos indicated that the main difference of the NCWSP from previous plans was that it would involve the construction of two smaller dams at the Kaliwa watershed instead of just the one. A main dam (Laiban Dam) would be built at the upper Kaliwa River in Barangay Laiban, and another regulating dam (Kaliwa Low Dam) further downstream. When the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) Investment Coordination Committee (ICC) had their October 4, 2013 Joint Cabinet Committee and Technical Board Meeting, however, they suggested that the MWSS to develop the project in stages, allowing for construction on the Kaliwa Low Dam to begin sooner, and for the Laiban Dam components of the project to be funded under a different financial mechanism. = Project financing = The original integrated project had been proposed by the MWSS under a Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) financing scheme. When the Joint Cabinet Committee and Technical Board Meeting of the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) Investment Coordination Committee (ICC) discussed the project on 4 October 2013, however, they recommended that the MWSS resubmit its proposal with only the Kaliwa Low Dam and water supply tunnel components, and that it be funded using the MWSS' funds or though overseas development assistance. = Approval of Kaliwa Low Dam proposal = The project, with its revised scope, was approved at the May 29, 2014 meeting of the NEDA Board, which is chaired by President Benigno Aquino III.http://www.solarnews.ph/news/2014/05/30/neda-approves-nine-projects- worth-p62-billion On July 28, 2014, President Aquino cited Kaliwa dam in his 5th State of the Nation Address as one of the infrastructure projects approved by his administration as part of its drought prevention efforts. In 2015, two consortia were pre-qualified to bid for the undertaking of the Kaliwa Dam projecthttps://www.bworldonline.com/integrated-ppp-vs-hybrid-ppp-the-case-of- kaliwa-dam/ — the SMC-K Water Consortium, which is a partnership between San Miguel Holdings Corp. and Korea Water Resources Corp.; and the Abeima-Datem Consortium, which is a partnership between Albeinsa Infraestructura Medio Ambiento S.A and Datem Inc.https://www.bworldonline.com/integrated-ppp-vs- hybrid-ppp-the-case-of-kaliwa-dam/ = Government shift to Chinese proposal= In 2019, under the administration of President Rodrigo Duterte, the government revealed that it would not continue with the project under a public–private partnership agreement as proposed during the Aquino administration, but would instead pursue the project using Official Development Assistance loan from China. Some lawyers have also noted that the interest rate of the Chinese deal was 2%, while the Japanese deal that was sidelined by the government only had a 1.25% interest. The Japanese have since renewed their call for the Philippine government to reconsider their proposal.  Social and environmental concerns  = Social issues = Ancestral lands belonging to indigenous Dumagats and Remontados will be affected by the Kaliwa Dam project. The coalition Sectors Opposed to the Kaliwa Dam (STOP Kaliwa Dam) estimate that 1,000 households from Barangay Daraitan in Tanay, Rizal, and 500 households in Pagsangahan, General Nakar, Quezon, will be inundated by the construction. The Samahan ng mga Katutubong Agta/Dumagat (Organization of Indigenous Agta/Dumagat) estimate that the project would displace 10,000 members of the Dumagat tribe. Protesters have maintained that indigenous communities that will be affected by the project were not consulted. Philippine law requires that such projects acquire free, prior, and informed consent (FPIC) from indigenous communities. = Environmental issues = Sierra Madre is one of the most biodiverse areas in the Philippines and the largest remaining rainforest in the country. An estimated 12,147 hectares of residual forests, home to 172 recorded plant or flora species will be affected by the dam construction. The project site is part of the Kaliwa Watershed Forest Reserve, which is supposedly protected by virtue of Proclamation No. 573 on June 22, 1968. Proclamation 1636 declared a portion of the area a National Park and Wildlife Sanctuary. Environmental groups have protested the project, as the dam will destroy a great portion of the Sierra Madre range. The dam will ultimately destroy numerous habitats of many endangered species living in the mountains, once construction begins.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3otb60P_2eg Among the thousands of plant and animal life whose home will be destroyed by the project is the critically endangered Philippine eagle. Other species that will be affected by the project are the endangered north Philippine hawk-eagle, the Philippine brown deer, the Philippine warty pig, and the vulnerable northern rufous hornbill.

Manistee Watch Company was a watch manufacturing company that produced pocket watch mechanisms from 1909 until 1912. History The Manistee Watch Company made low quality watch mechanisms that were put into cases by other companies. The watches were in 16 and 18 size. The company name was emblazoned on the back plate of most 18 size movements. Some 16 size movements were jeweled. The dials, jewels, and hairsprings for the mechanisms were purchased from European watch manufacturers, but all other parts aside from the outside case were produced at the Manistee Watch factory. Most of the jewels for the watches were from heliotrope garnet and manufactured specifically to the correct dimensions for the Manistee watches in Switzerland. The first watches made sold for five dollars each. Joseph M. Bachner (1853–1929), an inventor born in Alsace, France, designed the movements for low cost production to compete with the other inexpensive watches on the market. He also designed and constructed many of the specialized one-of-a-kind machines needed to make the watch parts. The mechanisms produced by the Manistee Watch Company factory were shipped to Ludington about 30 miles away and put into cases made by the Star Watch Case Company where Bachner previously worked. Bachner partnered with William Rath in 1905–06 to enter into a contract with Manistee city officials to build a manufacturing plant there. The city put up a portion of a $50,000 bond issue to help construct the brick-built watch factory on parkland adjacent to Manistee Lake at 123 Arthur Street. The three-story factory was built in 1908 and started watch production in March 1909. The first watch movements were 18 size and had 7 jewels. Rath was the president of the new company and Bachner was its general manager. Other directors of the factory were F.A. Bingham, Thomas J. Ramsdell, and Patrick Noud. The first floor housed the presses, drills, and lathes that formed the small watch parts and the second floor had the machines used by the employees to assemble the watch mechanisms. The third floor employees carried out assembly line inspections and any final assembly work that was required including adjusting. At the peak of production in 1909 there were 90 employees making 100 mechanisms per day. The factory put out 5 grades of watch movements, being 5 jewels, 7 jewels, 15 jewels, 17 jewels, and 21 jewels. Rath was a business associate of Warren Cartier. Cartier was the secretary of the Star Watch Case Company in nearby Ludington, and because of this relationship the companies worked in partnership. The Manistee Watch Company factory looked identical to the Star Watch Case Company which was built in Ludington in 1906. The factory building was made with no wood except the window frames. It produced its own electricity that ran all the electric motors throughout the plant facilities. The main building was constructed with reinforced concrete of the Kahn System invented and patented by Julius Kahn in 1902. The factory was placed in a location where a dust free environment was given priority. Disagreements arose between Rath and Bachner as to how the Manistee Watch Company should be run. Rath bought out Bachner's share of the business in a payment contract in 1910. The sales of the watches had slowed and there were insufficient funds for Rath to make his required payments to Bachner. In July 1911 Bachner sued Rath in federal court and the company was forced into bankruptcy and had to close. Additional funds were raised in August to reopen the factory. The company ultimately ceased production and permanently closed in 1912. The Manistee Watch Company had produced 60,000 pocket watches during its three-year existence. Business people from Chicago bought the machinery for $3,800 at an auction on August 6, 1912. The land and the factory building (which were valued at $30,000) were sold for $5,300. The old watch factory became the home of A.D. Joslin Manufacturing Company in 1917. Legacy There are less than fifty pocket watches known to exist in the United States of those produced by the Manistee Watch Company. The Henry Ford Museum has one in their collection that was made around 1910 that is 17 jeweled. The Manistee watch was the first time a non-magnetic hairspring was made for a pocket watch in the United States. The hairspring was made of an alloy that did not involve a ferrous material that otherwise would be magnetic. The alloy was as strong as and had a life expectancy similar to steel, but contained no steel. The economical alloy was gold in color. The name \\"Manistee Watch Company\\" is on file in Manistee as being owned by two businessmen, however no watches have been made by them.

A student living in a neighboring public school district or a foreign exchange student may seek admission to a public School District. For these cases, the Pennsylvania Department of Education sets an annual tuition rate for each school district. It is the amount the public school district pays to a charter school for each resident student that attends the charter and it is the amount a nonresident student's parents must pay to attend the Central Dauphin School District's schools. The 2012 tuition rates for Central Dauphin School District are Elementary Schools $9,179.86. For students who reside in other local school districts, their home school district pays its mandated tuition rate to the charter school. Harrisburg School District paid $10,193.86 for elementary students and Steelton-Highspire School District paid - $9,908.11. Wellness and food service Infinity Charter School was not required to establish a school wellness policy, because it does not participate in the federal school lunch program.

The school employs a part-time nurse who conducts the annual health screenings (data reported to the PDE and state Department of Health) and to monitor prescribed medications to students during the school day. Students can be excluded from school unless they comply with all the State Department of Health’s extensive immunization mandates. School nurses monitor each pupil for this compliance. Nurses also monitor each child's weight. The School participated in Highmark Foundation’s Healthy High 5 Health eTools for Schools grant which enabled mobile data collection of pertinent health and physical fitness screening data on students K-12 in a database held by InnerLink, Inc. in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Health eTools for Schools also provided interdisciplinary research-based curriculum in nutrition, physical education and physical activity to participating districts. The program was discontinued in 2013. School safety and bullying The Infinity Charter School administration reported there were zero incidents of bullying in the School in 2012. Additionally, there were no sexual incidents involving students. The local law enforcement was involved in zero incidents at the school. Each year the school safety data is reported by the School to the Safe School Center, which then publishes the compiled reports online. Nationally, nearly 20% of pupils report being bullied at school. The Infinity Charter School Board of Trustees has provided the School's antibully policy online.Infinity Charter School BOT, Bullying Policy 326, December 14, 2008 All Pennsylvania schools are required to have an anti-bullying policy incorporated into their Code of Student Conduct.

Early life and career Green was raised in Dagenham, Essex in rooms above a bike shop. From an impoverished Jewish background, Green's father ran a local shoe shop while her mother, though deaf, was the more formidable parent. Her father was cruel to her mother, although Green, their only child, attempted to control his behaviour. She did share a love of the cinema with him, and they saw two double features together each Thursday. From the movies, Green acquired her interest in glamour and fashion. Initially a short hand typist and secretary at Woman & Beauty in the 1940s, she was promoted to fashion editor within two years. After this she joined Housewife, where she assumed the same post, and then W.S. Crawford, the advertising agency, for a time. Mirror Group journalist In 1955, Hugh Cudlipp asked Green's opinion of Woman's Sunday Mirror, a publication for which he was responsible. Following a severe analysis, she was hired as Fleet Street's first female associate editor. The title was short-lived, being folded into Woman magazine. Green moved on to the Sunday Pictorial (as the Sunday Mirror was then named) in 1959 filling the same post as before. Since 1955, her immediate boss had been Lee Howard, and she became associate editor of the Daily Mirror in 1961 when Howard was appointed as the newspaper's editor. Green recalled her new colleagues response to her: \\"They were all being as helpfully 'feminine' as they could, which was the last thing I wanted. My plan was to make the pages interesting to men, too.\\" Her responsibilities included women's editor, and to promote the interests of women in all areas of the newspaper's activities. Her writing for the paper included fashion, although Green wrote in 2011 that she is really more interested in style, and admitted to modelling herself on film star Audrey Hepburn. For including the miniskirts of Mary Quant in the Mirror, Green was effectively threatened with the sack by Cecil King, then chairman of the International Publishing Corporation, of which the Mirror Group of Newspapers was a part. Cudlipp, by then chairman of the Mirror Group, supported her. According to Roy Greenslade, Cuidlipp told Green in December 1964: \\"I don't understand what you're doing but I trust you. So I've decided to give you the front and back pages of the Mirror to tell our readers what the Swinging 60s are all about.\\" Sex, Sense and Nonsense, published in November 2014, is Green's anthology of her 1960s work for the Daily Mirror. Executive posts and later career Green feels she retained a distance as a journalist and avoided being fully absorbed into the fashion industry. \\"Fashion is not a bloody religion, as most fashion editors seem to think it is,\\" she told Anna Murphy of The Daily Telegraph in 2014. \\"There is a difference between fashion and clothes. One is the real stuff, which is the clothes. Then there is fashion, which is some kind of mesmeric stuff out there that persuades the world to go in certain directions rather mysteriously. It's all big business. And I'd rather people spent money on clothes than arms.\\" Later Green became executive women's editor across the three Mirror titles, and in 1973, the group's publicity director. She joined the newspaper's board, the first woman to achieve such a position, at this point. Green had some initial trouble, as the only woman, using the directors' lift. She felt it was impossible to inform some wholesalers who objected that she was indeed so entitled. \\"You can't\\", she told Katharine Whitehorn for a 1978 article, \\"when you are five foot ome and a half.\\" She survived at the Miirror so long \\"by being nice to people. Don't start arguments. People can either help or hinder you. Well, you are an idiot if you cause them to hinder you. So I'm very tactful - if you are tactful people are always ready to help you.\\" In 1978 she resigned after discovering that a new male journalist had been appointed to the board at £30,000, more than twice her own salary of £14,000. \\"Apparently, I was supposed to be honoured simply to be a director\\", she observed years later. Meanwhile, in December 1977, Green joined Vidal Sassoon as managing director of operations in Europe and Executive Vice-President of the American company. Later she advised the board of the Telegraph and worked for the M&S; (Marks & Spencer) magazine, which included interviewing Margaret Thatcher about her fashion interests. In the early 1990s Green was a senior lecturer in fashion journalism at the Central St. Martins College of Art and Design. Private life and honours Green married the cigar importer Geoffrey Hill around 1952; the couple remained married until Hill died in 1992. She received the OBE in the Queen's 2012 Birthday Honours for services to journalism.

He was ordained in 1783, and in the same year was appointed curate of Ardglass, a parish in the county of Down. Burdy was only once promoted, to the perpetual curacy of Kilclief, a small preferment in County Down. This was soon after 1800, and he died there in 1820. Works In 1781 Burdy met the Rev. Philip Skelton, then in old age, and they became firm friends for the remaining six years of Skelton's life. Skelton lived in Dublin, and for three years Burdy used to visit him often. After Burdy left Dublin they corresponded till 4 November 1786. After Skelton's death Burdy researched for a biography, visiting Tyrone, Monaghan, and Donegal, to collect reminiscences of Skelton. In 1792 he published at Dublin The Life of the late Rev. Philip Skelton, with some curious anecdotes. The life was republished in London in two volumes, with the lives of Edward Pocock, Zachary Pearce, and Thomas Newton, in 1816. In 1824 a third edition appeared, prefixed to an edition of Skelton's works, edited by Robert Lynam, but with changes to the text of Burdy's biography.

There are two three types of keropok, mainly keropok lekor (boiled chewy ones), keropok goreng (fried chewy ones) and keropok keping (sliced, sun-dried and fried). There is none better than those found in Kampong Losong. Keropok lekor are actually made from processed fish meat mixed with salt and sagoo flour. This mixture is then hand rolled into sausage shaped around 6 to 10 inches long and immediately cooked. It is an afternoon snack normally dipped in Terengganu‟s equally famous chili sauce. * Chinatown, Kuala Terengganu (Kampong China) - Chinatown in Kuala Terengganu is first established by the Chinese community in the late 19th century. It was once a hub for commercial activities that help shape Kuala Terengganu into what it is today. The Chinese built the traditionally designed shop houses according to their place of origin in China. The buildings have been declared a heritage site by the United Nation‟s UNESCO World Monument Watch Programme and grants are being given annually to finance preservation of this pre-colonial heritage significant. * Terengganu State Museum - It is acclaimed as the largest of its kind in Malaysia. The Terengganu State Museum houses century old artifacts and artworks of rich and colourful heritage. Located on 27 hectares of land in Bukit Losong, Kuala Terengganu, the complex itself is an impressive architectural feature, based on the designs of the ancient Terengganu palace. * Redang Island - Of all the islands in Terengganu, the island is perhaps blessed with development and tourism infrastructures. To date, chalets and resorts have mushroomed to cater for the ever-increasing tourist arrivals. There is a small airport for a direct flight from Subang Airport, Kuala Lumpur and Seletar Airport, Singapore, operated by Berjaya Air. Most of the arrival is via Merang Jetty in Setiu. The Fisheries Act of 1985 declared Redang and its archipelago as a marine park. In Marine Park located in Pulau Pinang, visitors can hand-feed the fishes while snorkeling. In fact, the whole of the island offers abundance of marine lives, coral gardens and a few ship wrecks which are definite thrills and excitements for scuba-divers. * Bidong Island - It was internationally well known as the relocation center for Vietnamese refugees from the mid-1970s until it was closed in the early 1990s. The state government decided that no accommodation facilities are to be built on the island. Remnants of hospital, school, sundry shops and warehouse are a stark reminder of what is used to be home to thousands of boat people. There is a turtle research centre led by a local university and an underwater gallery that hosts replicas of Inscribed Stone (Batu Bersurat), a Keris, a traditional sampan and betel chewing canisters (tepak sireh) located 15m underwater. * Lang Tengah Island - Its name is derived from the sea eagles that breed on this picturesque island. The island is accessible via Merang Jetty in Setiu. Located between Pulau Perhentian and Pulau Redang, Pulau Lang Tengah's natural habitat remains untouched. The jungles are still retains its natural eco system. There are only four resorts with their own private beach. =Besut= Besut is the northernmost district in Terengganu and it borders with Kelantan. Jertih is the commercial hub while Kampung Raja is the administrative centre. Besut has so much to offer for visitors. The splendour of nature awaits them at Pulau Perhentian, Pulau Rhu, the waterfalls of Lata Tembakah, the therapeutic Kampung La Hot Spring and the pristine beaches of Pantai Bukit Keluang, Pantai Air Tawar and Pantai Dendong. Besut is also home to thriving cottage industry that includes woods carving, leather crafts and rattan weaving. =Setiu= It is believed that Setiu got its name from a Bugis chieftain, who, after months of travelling all the way from Sumatera, decided to stay in Setiu for good. Bandar Permaisuri, which means Queen's town, is the district capital as well as the administrative centre. Setiu is known for its beaches, its traditional fishing villages and its nature. Another attraction in Setiu is its wetland areas.

Each required the transport of heavy cargo which could not be delivered in parts. For its study in 1974, the State Committee of the Council of Ministers of the USSR created a temporary scientific and technical committee to prepare proposals for transporting oversized cargoes of a large mass (OCLM). Its proposals were reflected in the State Committee resolutions \\"On ensuring the transportation of large-sized and heavy energy and other industrial equipment and the development of related research and development work\\" and \\"Guidelines for the research and design work to ensure the transportation of the energy and other industrial equipment\\", dated 24 November 1976. These documents outlined the main problems of research and development work and measures to satisfy the needs of the national economy for equipment transportation, including the search for new technical and logistical solutions. In May 1976, a Spetstyazhavtotrans convoy was established in Gorky. On 6 April 1978 Resolution 262 of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, \\"On measures to improve the organization of transportation of large-sized and heavy cargoes\\", was made. Among the series of measures, the establishment of the specialized research and production association (SRPA) Spetstyazhavtotrans was mandated. By the early 1990s Spetstyazhavtotrans was a research and production group accounting, according to some estimates, for over 60 percent of oversize transport in the country. It consisted of five large trucking companies in Novgorod, Leningrad, Moscow and Astrakhan, with branches in other cities. Bases were established in Siberia, where there was a great need for transport, in cities which included Surgut, Noyabrsk and Nizhnevartovsk. The Spetstyazhavtotrans SRPA created a unified system for transporting oversize cargo and engineering services. Significant contributions were made by A. M. Lyovushkin, L. Y. Byzer, V. S. Molyarchuk, V. N. Androsyuk, A. G. Alexandrov, A. S. Diamidov, N. A. Troitskaya, V. A. Alexandrov, V. P. Safronov, L. M. Moshek, A. A. Lvov, A. Ya. Kogan, P. A. Shpolyansky, R. A. Atanasyan and many others. Spetstyazhproekt was re-created, and in 2008 NefteGazEnergoStroy Engineering (NGES Engineering LLC) was added to the corporate group which included Polynom LLC. A new production and scientific structure, providing engineering support for transportation and facility design for the chemical and petrochemical industries, was forming.

At unspecified time he became asesor juridico for the provincial Biscay self- governmentABC 03.10.65, available here and it is likely that in this role he met Esteban Bilbao, the friend of his father and during primoderiverista period the president of the Biscay diputación; Bilbao was to become Iturmendi's lifetime political patron and Iturmendi turned his protégé and successor. In the early 1930s Iturmendi continued as a lawyer; during Dictablanda he worked with his father in the same office,Anuario del País Vasco 1930, p. 388, available here but in the Republican period he set up an office of his own.Anuario Regional 1932, p. 661, available here None of the sources consulted clearly notes him as involved in any political activity. Later works and press notes referred to Iturmendi as a Carlist and Traditionalist,see e.g. “[Iturmendi] fue originariamente tradicionalista, peró entró en FET-JONS”, Martí Marín Cobrera, Los gobernadores civiles del franquismo, [in:] Historia y Política 29 (2013), p. 276 though it is not confirmed that like Esteban Bilbao he joined Traditionalist Communion or otherwise engaged in Carlist initiatives. An apparently well-known Iturmendi was recorded as involved in Acción Popular in the Biscay countryside, though it is not clear whether the person is question was Antonio, his father or any other family member.El Nervión 20.01.36, available here There is no data available related to Iturmendi's stand prior and shortly after the July 1936 coup. It is not known whether he was involved in the Carlist conspiracy, where he resided during the outbreak of the Civil War and what his fate was in the next few months. In August 1936 José Iturmendi showed up in Burgos and publicly declared adhesion to the military Junta, yet a corresponding press note did not mention Antonio as accompanying his father.Diario de Burgos 07.08.36, available here He reportedly accepted the Unification Decree of April 1937 and was among these Carlists who readily joined the new Francoist state party, Falange Española Tradicionalista,Ramón María Rodón Guinjoan, Invierno, primavera y otoño del carlismo (1939-1976) [PhD thesis Universitat Abat Oliba CEU], Barcelona 2015, p. 30 though the first confirmed information on his whereabouts comes from December 1937. Recommended by Esteban Bilbao, Iturmendi was nominated into a 3-member Comisión Liquidadora;Eduardo J. Alonso Olea, El crédito de la Unión Minera, [in:] Historia Contemporánea 24 (2002), p. 346 once the Nationalists scrapped all separate provincial Biscay arrangements, especially Concierto Económico, the body was entrusted with engineering their legal handover to the central administration and it completed the task within few months.El Pensamiento Alaves 13.12.37, available here a Also the next Iturmendi's assignment kept him busy in Bilbao. In August 1938 the Nationalist Ministry of Interior appointed the 3rd municipal administration, headed by José Lequerica; in a trademark Francoist move of balancing various political groupings, as a tractable Carlist Iturmendi was nominated primero teniente de alcalde, de facto the deputy mayor of the city.Iturmendi Bañales, Antonio entry, [in:] Auñamendi Eusko Entziklopedia service, available here He became president of the Economic and Budgetary CommissionJoseba Agirreazkuenaga, Mikel Urquijo (eds.), Bilbao desde sus alcaldes: Diccionario biográfico de los alcaldes de Bilbao y gestión municipal en la Dictadura vol. 3, Bilbao 2008, ,p. 178 and entered executive boards of commercial companies controlled by the city, e.g. he joined Junta de Gobierno of Caja de Ahorros de Bilbao.Agirreazkuenaga, Urquijo 2008, p. 180 None of the sources consulted provides any detailed information on his activity in the town hall; it is neither clear when exactly he ceased. Most sources note that in January 1939 he was posted to a new job in Catalonia; however, some works list Iturmendi as member of the Bilbao administration until March 1939.Agirreazkuenaga, Urquijo 2008, p. 178. One source claims that Iturmendi was appointed a concejal in the Bilbao ayuntamiento in 1950, see the Real Academia de Historia service; this information is not confirmed elsewhere and might result from confusion; it was Antonio's brother Pedro Iturmendi Banales who served as concejal in the Bilbao ayuntamiento during few strings in course of early Francoism Rise and demise Falangist standard In January 1939 Iturmendi was nominated the first Francoist gobernador civil in Tarragona.technically the first Francoist civil governor of Tarragona was Carmelo Monzón Mosso, nominated in April 1938 (also for the province of Castellón). At that time the Nationalist made first incursions into the province, yet until January 1939 they never controlled more than 25% of its territory. Official provincial site does not count Monzón as the civil governor, Govern civil de Tarragona, [in:] Tarragona service, available here He is noted as involved in anti-Republican purges; officials deemed “anti- patriotic” were to be removed or suspended.Josep Recasens Llort, La repressió franquista a la Ribera d'Ebre (1938-1945), Valls 2003, , p. 293 Iturmendi was also recorded for his role during a conflict related to cardenal Vidal Barraquer. Furious about the archbishop's neutralist stance, Franco was determined to prevent his return to Tarragona;Gonzalo Redondo, Historia de la Iglesia en España, 1931-1939: La Guerra Civil, 1936-1939, Madrid 1993, , pp. 566-567 Iturmendi helped to outmaneuver the provisional papal nominee, Francesc Vives, and greatly contributed to final defeat of the Vatican's diplomacy in their struggle to reinstate Vidal.Hilari Raguer, Gunpowder and Incense: The Catholic Church and the Spanish Civil War, London 2007, , pp. 299-301 In March 1939Boletín Oficial del Estado 13.03.39, available here Iturmendi was transferred to civil governor position in Zaragoza, which he held for 5 months. Again, he is noted as the one whose hand “did not tremble” when dealing with officials suspected of lack of enthusiasm for the new regime.Antoni Segura, La dictadura franquista, Barcelona 2012, , p. 166 In August 1939 Iturmendi ceased as the Zaragoza governor and was nominated head of Dirección General de Administración Local within the Ministry of Interior;Imperio 17.08.39, available here the job presented him with enormous powers as he became responsible for these local nominations which were not reserved for the Minister or civil governors.Iturmendi Bañales, Antonio entry, [in:] Auñamendi Eusko Entziklopedia service, available here Indeed, he cautiously endorsed Carlists in ranks of the local officials, noted for promoting his fellow Traditionalists in Vic,Martí Marín i Corbera, El personal polític de l’ajuntament de Vic durant el franquisme: algunes consideracions (1939-1975), [in:] Recerques: história, economia, cultura 31 (1995), p. 392 ValenciaAndreu Ginés i Sànchez, La instauració del franquisme al País Valencià [PhD thesis Barcelona Universitat Pompeu Fabra], Barcelona 2008, p. 702 or Bilbao.Alfonso Ballestero, José Ma de Oriol y Urquijo, Madrid 2014, , p. 76 He also organized from scratch Cuerpo de Funcionarios of the local administration and founded a dedicated school named Instituto de Estudios de Administración Local, serving at the same time as its vice-president.Iturmendi Bañales, Antonio entry, [in:] Auñamendi Eusko Entziklopedia service, available here, La Vanguardia Española 05.03.76, available here Basilica de Begoña In September 1939 Iturmendi was appointed to the second Consejo Nacional of Falange;ABC 13.09.39, available here according to some scholars he represented the Carlist “colaboracionistas”, who replaced Carlist “duros”.like Manuel Fal Conde or María Rosa Urraca Pastor, Josep Miralles Climent, La rebeldía carlista.

Payne, The Franco Regime, Madison 2011, , p. 287 another account has it that Serrano was Iturmendi's “mentor”.Marin Cobrera 2013, p. 276 Iturmendi's position versus Carlism remained ambiguous. On the one hand, as high official of the Interior he monitored the intransigent party activists and denounced some as \\"aliadofilos\\".Miralles Climent 2018, p. 162, Manuel Martorell Pérez, Antonio Arrue, Euskaltzaindiaren suspertzean lagundu zuen karlista, [in:] Euskera 56 (2011), p. 856 On the other, in late 1941 he visited the Falangist secretario general and demanded that Traditionalists are no longer isolated and marginalized.Mercedes Peñalba Sotorrío, Entre la boina roja y la camisa azul, Estella 2013, , p. 88. Another author claims that Iturmendi made the same representation already in 1940, denouncing “agravios inferidos a los tradicionalistas”, Miralles Climent 2018, p. 148. However, the author claims this representation was made to Arrese, who at the time was not the FET secretary general He maintained relations with collaborative Carlists; in August 1942 he was present during a sermon to honor the Carlist dead, which later became known as the Begoña incident.Rodón Guinjoan 2015, p. 90 Iturmendi emerged unhurtAurora Villanueva Martínez, Organizacion, actividad y bases del carlismo navarro durante el primer franquismo, [in:] Geronimo de Uztariz 19 (2003), p. 115, Miralles Climent 2018, p. 217 yet he was furious about the hardline Falangism. In protest he resigned his seat in Consejo Nacional;Martorell Pérez 2008, p. 188 shortly afterwards he ceased as sub- secretary in the Interior.Marín i Cobrera 2001, p. 392 It is not clear whether the dismissal was related to his resignation; some scholars claim that on the contrary, he was fired as part of the anti-Serranista purges in the ministry.Marin Cobrera 2013, p. 276 From sidelines back to power Esteban Bilbao In late 1942 Iturmendi was not re-appointed to the new Consejo NacionalBoletín Oficial del Estado 329 (1942), available here and he found himself on the sidelines of official politics; according to some scholars he commenced the period of “largo ostracismo”, which was to last until the end of the decade.Marin Cobrera 2013, p. 276 Politically he seemed bewildered, vacillating between Javierista Carlism, Juanista Carlism, Carloctavismo and Francoism. In 1943 together with orthodox Carlist leaders he signed a letter to Franco; the signatories demanded that totalitarian features of the regime are removed and traditional institutions are brought back.Ballestero 2014, p. 80, Robert Vallverdú i Martí, La metamorfosi del carlisme català: del \\"Déu, Pàtria i Rei\\" a l'Assamblea de Catalunya (1936-1975), Barcelona 2014, , p. 96, César Alcalá, D.

Una biografía política (1901-1980), Barcelona 2001, , p. 53 Some authors claim that in 1944 Iturmendi returned to Comunión Tradicionalista, allegedly because he sensed that after the Allied takeover of Western Europe the end of Francoism was near.Manuel Martorell Pérez, Carlos Hugo frente a Juan Carlos. La solución federal para España que Franco rechazó, Madrid 2014, , p. 68 However, almost at the same time Iturmendi was reportedly engaged in drafting a political manifesto of the Alfonsist claimant Don Juan; it materialized in 1946 as Bases Institucionales de la Monarquía Española. Some scholars claim that the 1946 Ley de Sucesión partially acknowledged the Juanista proposal.published 1946 under auspices of Don Juan and prepared jointly by Iturmendi, Rodezno, Gil-Robles and Saínz- Rodriguez, Alvaro Rodríguez Núñez, Franquismo y tradicionalismo.

Indeed, he started to re-gain position in officialdom;according to one scholar Iturmendi left Falange altogether but returned in 1946, Martorell Pérez 2014, p. 68 in 1947 he was appointed to the new Consejo Nacional of FalangeMontagut Contreras 2008 and as its member he automatically gained seat in the third Francoist Cortes, assembled in 1949.Iturmendi Bañales, Antonio entry, [in:] Cortes service, available here. former FEFASA Though not holding important political positions throughout most of the 1940s, Iturmendi did not entirely fall out of grace. At unspecified time in the mid-1940sEl Pensamiento Alaves 05.04.45, available here he was appointed president of the executive board of Fabricación Española de Fibras Textiles Artificiales, the company created within the Instituto Nacional de Industria framework in Miranda de Ebro. As part of the Francoist plan of reaching full economic independence, FEFASA was tasked with launching production of synthetic fiber; though based on German technology, the bid was not successful before Iturmendi ceased as president.it is not clear when Iturmendi ceased as FEFASA president. The last time he was noted in the press in such role was 1950. In a large 1957 article related he was not mentioned at all, compare Diario de Burgos 30.07.57, available here. For further details on FEFASA and its role in the INI economic plan see Daniel Lanero, Dulce Freire (eds.), Agricultura y inovación tecnológica en la península ibérica, Madrid 2011, , p. 175 Other commercial enterprises he engaged in were Pola and Nervión, two Bilbao-based insurance companies where he worked as consejero.Mundo Obrero 15.08.51, here Iturmendi resumed also the law practice, though not in Bilbao but in Madrid; he served as abogado del estado before various Tribunales in the capital.Iturmendi Bañales, Antonio entry, [in:] Auñamendi Eusko Entziklopedia service, available here, ABC 03.10.65, available here He engaged also in more ambitious juridical activities. In a move hardly compatible with his earlier work in Liquidadora, he took part in works developing legal infrastructure for semi-autonomous governance which would incorporate some fuerista establishments into the civil code. They climaxed in Congreso Nacional de Derecho Civil in Zaragoza in 1946; its resolutions paved the way for a 1947 decree, which in turned enabled further works.Encarna Roca Trías, La postcodificación civil: la unidad de Códigos, una política muerta, [in:] Anuario de historia del derecho español 82 (2012), pp. 178-179 They were to continue grudgingly throughout decades and ultimately turned out to be a failure, yet even 20 years later Iturmendi considered them vital for Spanish legal system.Miguel L.

According to some authors the draft was ready before Grimau’s execution, Julián Casanova, Carlos Gil Andrés, Twentieth-Century Spain: A History, Cambridge 2014, , p. 267 In 1963 he admitted to 610 political prisoners in Spain.Manuel L. Abellán, Medio siglo de cultura (1939-1989), Amsterdam 1990, , p. 251 When discussing his governmental career many scholars do not focus on Iturmendi's ministerial work but single out his stand during the 1956 crisis, when Falange hardliners led by Arrese produced the last serious attempt to convert the regime into a totalitarian system. Since 1947 continuously member of the Falangist Consejo Nacional, in 1955 Iturmendi was appointed to a party committee entrusted with drafting the law. First he tried to water it down during internal works of the committeeItuemrndi tried to argue that the law would turn FET into bureaucratic, state-dependent institution without life, J.

Auge y declive del tradicionalismo carlista (1957-1967), Madrid 2016, , p. 39 However, others note that Iturmendi remained entirely loyal to the dictator and was even prepared to lead a new Carlist organisation sponsored by the regime and with the sole purpose to distract and fragment the Traditionalists.Vázquez de Prada 2011, p. 398 In the 1950s Iturmendi as the minister of justice a few times met Don Javier and always demanded that the latter tunes down his statements;the first meeting between Iturmendi and Don Javier is dated for 1952, when after the Barcelona Eucharistic Congress the minister visited the claimant and challenged his monarchic statements, claiming that there is only one jefe del estado and everyone claiming such role might be considered subversive, Francisco Manuel Heras y Borrero, Carlos Hugo el Rey que no pudo ser: la lucha por el trono de España de Carlos Hugo de Borbón Parma, la última esperanza del carlismo, Madrid 2010, , p. 51, Martorell Pérez 2008, p. 396 in 1955 he twice met the claimantAna Marín Fidaldo, Manuel M.

As minister of justice Iturmendi was crucial in countering efforts to obtain Spanish citizenship either for the princeVázquez de Prada 2016, pp. 222, 232 or for his father;Vázquez de Prada 2016, p. 247 he also worked to restrict the Hugocarlista campaign in the media.Martorell Pérez 2008, p. 484 In return he gained virulent hostility of the Carlos Hugo supporters,the key antagonist of Iturmendi within the Hugocarlista camp was Ramón Massó, Vázquez de Prada 2016, pp. 55, 130 who denounced him as traitor to the Carlist cause.Lavardín 1976, p. 213 They also tried to insult him in public; one such incident during the 1964 Corpus Christi celebrations in Toledowhen Ituemrndi led the Corpus Christi parade the young Hugocarlistas assaulted him with cries of “traidor” and “Rey Javier!”, Martorell Pérez 2014, p. 163 triggered repression against the assailants.Francisco Javier Caspistegui Gorasurreta, El naufragio de las ortodoxias.

It is not entirely clear what was Iturmendi's position in terms of practical politics, except that he remained utterly loyal to Franco. Some scholars counted him among key Juanista or Juancarlista supporters already since the late 1950s.Miralles Climent 2018, p. 364, Vázquez de Prada 2016, p. 34, Marín Fidaldo, Burgueño 1980, p. 52 Vázquez de Prada 2009, p. 192 Others note that faced with two overlapping sets of rivalries within the government - technocratic monarchists versus regentialists and immovilistas versus reformists - Iturmendi preferred not to take a firm stand and fluctuated.Payne 2011, p. 505 It is clear that he kept opposing the syndicalist hardliners; during 1967 works on Ley de Representacion Familiar he blocked the Falangists from entering the draft committee and ultimately ensured liberalization of the electoral law.Pedro Cobo Pulido, Representación familair en la época de Franco (1945-1974) [PhD thesis Universidad de Malaga], Málaga 200, p. 220 He also remained on ice-cold terms with Hugocarlista supporters; when two of their MPs faced legal action related to so-called Cortes Transhumantes activity Iturmendi refused any assistance.the Carlist MPs José Angel Zubiaur and Auxilio Goñi were charged with attending so-called Cortes Transhumantes, rump sessions of willing Cortes deputies staged across the country, Caspistegui 1997, p. 334 His monarchist efforts were finally crowned in 1969, when Don Juan Carlos was nominated the future king of Spain; Iturmendi played a personal role in the ceremony since it was in front of him as president of the Cortes that the royal hopeful swore fidelity to the Francoist leyes fundamentales.Montagut Contreras 2008 Franco In late 1969 Iturmendi resigned as president of the Cortes, Consejo del Reino and Consejo de Regencia; he quoted his age and declared withdrawal from active politics.Iturmendi Bañales, Antonio entry, [in:] Auñamendi Eusko Entziklopedia service, available here This did not prevent his 8th consecutive appointment to the Cortes in 1971, since not having resigned his seat in the National Council of the Movimiento he still automatically qualified as procurador.Iturmendi Bañales, Antonio, [in:] Cortes service, available here His last term lasted unexpectedly long as the parliament was not dissolved until his death;see Iturmendi’s Cortes’ tickets at the official website of the house, available here similarly he also retained membership in Consejo Nacional. Already a septuagenarian, he usually remained politically passive. However, in the early 1970s he was noted for joining forces with Traditionalist Carlists in an attempt to build Hermandad de Maestrazgo, an organization supposed to counter the progressive Hugocarlista bid to control Carlism.Caspistegui 1997, p. 237; on the other hand, a small monograph dedicated to Hermandad does not mention Iturmendi at all, see Ramón Rodón Guinjoan, Una aproximación al estudio de la Hermandad Nacional Monárquica del Maestrazgo y del Partido Social Regionalista, [in:] Aportes 88 (2015), pp. 169-201 Following the death of Franco Iturmendi was counted among “40 de Ayete”, direct Franco appointees to the Council and to the Cortes still serving; others name him “pata negra franquista”.Gregorio Morán, Adolfo Suárez: Ambición y destino, Madrid 2011, , p. 75 Reception and legacy Academia de Jurisprudencia site During the Francoist era Iturmendi was hailed in the media as a great statesman.

At least in one street has been named after him.one such street has been identified in Quart de Poblet; it is not clear when it was named after Iturmendi Over time perception of Iturmendi and his role in history changed dramatically. Though already in the 1950s he was dubbed “a scoundrel” by some orthodox Carlistse.g. by an orthodox Carlist historian Melchor Ferrer, referred after Vallverdu 2014, p. 151 and declared “a traitor” by Hugocarlista politicians and Hugocalista historiography in the 1970s,Iturmendi is pictured in “Gallery of traitors” by a Hugocarlista historian, Clemente 2011, pp. 231-232 only in the late 20th century in the Spanish public discourse his dominant image became this of a villain, member of the dictatorial authoritarian elite associated with repression.see Marzal 2015, Segura 2012, Recasens Llort 2003 The anti-Francoist backlash of the 21st century changed street names;the Quart de Poblet street was purged in 2016, see Las 13 Rosas y otras mujeres renombran calles franquistas de Quart de Poblet, [in:] La Vanguardia 21.07.16, available here left-wing deputies demand that his portrait gets removed from the gallery of Cortes speakerssee Communicado de Izquierda Republicana, [in:] Izquierda Repubulicana service available here and his official biography on the Cortes website was long in the status of “being reworked”.“biografía en proceso de remodelación”; the effect of this re-work is Antonio Iturmendi Bañales entry, [in:] Congreso service, available here Family relation with Iturmendi was used in campaign against his nephew, José Iturmendi Morales, when he ran for the Universidad Complutense rectorship in 2011.Diego Barcala, Iturmendi, el requeté que aspira a ser rector, [in:] Público service 12.04.11, available here In some partisan works he is dubbed “canalla”.Antonio Arizmendi, Patricio de Blas Zabaleta, Conspiración contra el obispo de Calahorra: Denuncia y crónica de una canallada, Madrid 2008, , pp. 12, 58, 95-96. The book deals with the Francoist smear campaign, subsequent marginalisation and media blackout on Fidel García Martínez, the former bishop of Calahorra; Iturmendi is presented as the one who forced the church into silence over the regime’s campaign of insults and mockery There are authors who deny him the name of a TraditionalistIturmendi is dubbed “pseudo-tradicionalista” in Miralles Climent 2018, p. 332 or a Carlist.Iturmendi is classified as representative of „post-carlism”, Bartyzel 2015, p. 69 In scientific historiographic discourse Iturmendi has not earned a monograph so far, be it a full-blown biography or a minor article. In general works dealing with Francoism he is usually acknowledged as a noticeable, but second-rate figure, a man who held two important jobs but who did not qualify among key policy-makers of the regime.see e.g. key English-language works on the regime, written by authors who usually present a strikingly different perspective of the Spanish recent history, Stanley G. Payne, The Franco Regime, Madison 2011, , and Paul Preston, Franco. A Biography, London 1995, Some scholars suggest that the likes of Rodezno, Bilbao and Iturmendi were instrumental in shaping Francoism as they infused Traditionalist spirit into the corporative organicist concepts of the early regime,Caspistegui 1997, p. 11 some rather underline his role in relation to the Alfonsist restoration and the ultimate crowning of Don Juan Carlos,for scholarly discouse see e.g. García Riol 2015, p. 217, Martorell Pérez 2018, p. 20, Vázquez de Prada 2016, p. 92. For popular media discourse, see e.g. Manuel Martorell, La ‘Operación Salmón’ de los tecnócratas abrió a Juan Carlos las puertas del Trono, [in:] Cuartopoder service, 08.01.17, available here and some tend to present him as an opportunist who did not let “Carlism get in the way” of his career.MacClancy 2000, p. 93 Some mention him on the list of Basques on prominent positions within Francoism.see e.g. Jesús Laínz Fernández, Adiós, España: Verdad y mentira de los nacionalismos, Madrid 2010, , Yolanda Couceiro, El euskera se prohibió con Franco?

The Institute is an autonomous body and is sponsored by the Department of Agricultural Research and Education (DARE), Ministry of Agriculture, Government of India. It is situated in Avikanagar, Malpura, in Rajasthan, India. It works in close liaison with the other ICAR institutes, Central Wool Development Board, Sheep and Wool Marketing Federation, Department of Biotechnology (GOI), Small Entrepreneurs, NGOs, State Animal Husbandry and Khadi gram and Cottage industries.Central Sheep and Wool Research Institute, AvikanagarThe Hindu Business Line : Rearing wool-breed sheep in jails  Profile  The Central Sheep and Wool Research Institute was established in 1962 at Malpura, presently known as Avikanagar in Rajasthan, India,Research on small ruminants in India with a campus covering an area of 1510 hectares and with the principal objective to enhance the productivity of sheep and rabbit through scientific methods by developing and applying new technologies.CENTRAL SHEEP & WOOL RESEARCH INSTITUTE - Govt. Organizations - Indian Livestock Farms The activities of the Institute are spread across three regional centres: The North Temperate Regional Station (NTRS): NTRS was established in 1963 at Garsa, Kullu in Himachal Pradesh and is engaged in research work on high quality germplasm of Gaddi Synthetic for improvement of sheep for fine wool production. The Southern Regional Research Centre (SRRC): SRRC was established in 1965 and is located at Mannavanur, app 35 km from Kodaikanal in Tamil Nadu. It is engaged in research on fine wool sheep and broiler rabbits. Arid Region Campus (ARC): ARC was established in 1974 at Bikaner in Rajasthan with a land area of 636 hectares and has rearing facilities for Magra and Marwari sheep.  Mandate  The mandate of the Central Sheep and Wool Research Institute is to engage in basic and applied research on sheep and rabbit production, health, utilization, training and transfer of technologies to beneficiaries. The objectives of the Institute are: * To undertake basic and applied research on all aspects of sheep and rabbit production. * To develop, update and standardize meat, fibre and pelt technologies. * To impart training on sheep and rabbit production and utilization. * To transfer improved technologies on sheep and rabbit production to farmers, rural artisans and development workers. * To provide referral and consultancy services on production and product technologies of sheep and rabbits. Infrastructure The Institute is equipped with research laboratories attending to Animal Genetics, Physiology, Reproduction, Biochemistry, Animal Health, Animal Nutrition and Animal climatic chamber. It has a farm area measuring 1591 hectares, cenchrus pasture land of 175 hectares and forest and ravine land extending to 522 hectares. The other infrastructural facilities include administrative building, library building, residential complex, guest house, auditorium, conference hall, committee room, Human dispensary and Kendriya Vidyalaya project school. An Agriculture Knowledge Management Unit (AKMU) operates at the Institute. The Institute rears about 3500 sheep of different breeds, 600 goat of Sirohi breeds and 600 rabbit breeds.  Departments  CSWRI is departmentalised into six divisions, each attending to a specific set of activities. =Division of Animal Genetics and Breeding= Division of Animal Genetics and Breeding was started in 1966 under the name Sheep Genetic Section with a mandate to conduct research on improvement of indigenous breeds of sheep for wool and meat. It was renamed as Division of Animal Genetics and Breeding in 1975. Animal Genetics and Breeding Division carried out pioneer work in the field of crossbreeding for improving the production of mutton, carpet wool, apparel wool and pelt. Various crosses like Avikalin, Bharat Merino, Avimaans, Indian Karakul, Awassi X Malpura and Avivastra were developed at this division. Research was also carried out with indigenous goats (Marwari, Sirohi and Kutchi) to evolve milk and meat producing goats. The biochemical polymorphic studies were undertaken to study the inheritance of various blood constituents and to determine the possible association of these biochemical parameters with economic traits. Cytogenetic studies were initiated in 1982. In 1997, Garole, a prolific microsheep of West Bengal was introduced for increasing prolificacy of Malpura sheep. Marker Assisted Selection (MAS) for prolificacy has been practically used in the routine breeding programme. In 2008, Patanwadi inheritance was introduced into prolificacy project to improve the milk yield and mothering ability. Three breed prolific cross was produced in 2009 and strengthening of prolific flock is in progress. Recently study on understanding the genetic basis of immune response variability in sheep has been initiated. Stalwarts like Dr. M V Krishna Rao, Dr. O N Singh, Dr. R M Acharya, Dr. R Nagercenkar, Dr. A L Chaudhary, Dr. R N Singh, Dr. C L Arora, Dr. S D J Bohra, Dr. B U Khan, Dr. V K Singh and Dr. A L Arora had shaped the development and progress of this division. At present Dr. Arun Kumar is head of the division. =Division of Animal Nutrition= The division had its origin in 1965 under the name, the Sheep Nutrition Section and was upgraded to cover all aspects of animal nutrition including grass land and forage agronomy. The division is mandated to: * Evaluate various types of feed resources- pasture (grasses, legumes), top feed resources, agro-industrial by- products and non-conventional feeds. * Determine nutritional requirements for various production functions in sheep and rabbits. * Develop feeding strategies for sheep, goat and rabbit production. * Identify and reduce the adverse effect of various anti-nutritional factors in the feed. * Improve low grade roughages. =Division of Animal Health= The Division of Animal Health was originally with Sheep Husbandry section but was upgraded as an independent division in 1987. The initial mandate of the division was to cover the health related aspects of the flocks under the institute. Later, the division was expanded by obtaining diagnostic laboratories and other equipment.http://www.oie.int/doc/ged/D8930.PDF =Division of Physiology and Biochemistry= CSWRI started a Physiology section 1965 for research on ovine physiology and reproduction with special emphasis on environmental physiology and applied reproduction. In 2003, the section was merged with Biochemistry section and the division was formed. Major projects of the division centers around ram semen preservation, artificial insemination and adjudging the physiological adaptability of different strains developed at the institute. =Division of Textile Manufacture and Textile Chemistry= The division was started in 1962 when the institute was formed and is engaged in basic and applied research on various aspects of wool and other animal fibres. It is mandated to carry out research on: * Fibre characterization and evaluation * Grading of wool and scouring * Woolen spinning * Worsted spinning * Weaving * Chemical and mechanical finishing * Product development The division has a wool processing plant at its command since 1968, equipped with a boiler, weaving machinery, worsted spinning machinery and other types of wool and animal fibre processing machineries and produces wool products for sale.Bharat Merino Fine Wool Sheep Breed Of Sub Temperate Cold Climate http://nopr.niscair.res.in/bitstream/123456789/24844/1/IJFTR%2027(1)%2095-98.pdf =Division of Transfer of Technology and Social Sciences= TTS Division was established in 1972 and is the controlling centre of the institute on matters related to technology transfer. The division is entrusted with the responsibility to: * Test and transfer the technologies being developed for increasing meat and wool production of sheep and rabbits. * Survey and evaluate the productivity of sheep and rabbits in field conditions. * Motivate farmers to increase sheep and rabbit production by adopting improved practices of breeding, feeding, reproduction, disease control, feed resource, wool utilization, marketing, etc. * Create awareness in the sheep and rabbit farmers about improved animal husbandry practices. The division is also active in farmer interaction programs such as health camps, sheep/farmer festivals, farmers' meets, forest festivals, observance of veterinary days and field visits.Kisan Gosthi Sections Shoulder of lamb Goat chops Rabbit meat In addition to the six divisions, CSWRI has five sections attending to specified responsibilities. =Animal Biotechnology Section= The section, started in 2002, has a mandate to organise research on sheep genomics, reproductive biotechnology, disease resistance and molecular parasitology.

Different breeds of sheep are being improved through selection and inter-se mating for wool and mutton production. The mandate of NWPSI is genetic evaluation and improvement of indigenous sheep by selection. Presently, there are six ongoing centres of NWPSI including four farm based units and two field based units located at difference parts of the country. Coordination Cell: Project Coordinator Cell, NWPSI, ICAR-CSWRI, Avikanagar Cooperating Units: A. Farm based Cooperating units 1.ARC (CSWRI), Bikaner - Marwari sheep for Carpet Wool 2.CIRG, Makhdoom - Muzaffarnagri sheep for Dual purpose 3.MPKV, Rahuri - Deccani sheep for Dual purpose 4.SVVU, Palamner - Nellore sheep for Mutton B. Field based Cooperating units 1.TANUVAS, Kattupakkam - Madras Red sheep for Mutton 2.ARC (CSWRI), Bikaner- Magra Sheep for Carpet wool The objectives of NWPSI is Genetic improvement of indigenous sheep breeds by selection. The technical programme aims at improvement of indigenous sheep breeds under farm conditions wherein the male lambs are first ranked using selection index. Index incorporates body weight and wool yield at six months of age. Each field-based unit has four centres including a ram- rearing centre, covering a sheep population of about 1500 sheep per centre. The superior male lambs are selected from the farmers’ flocks on the basis of GFY1 and 6-month body weigh in Magra sheep and on six-month body weight basis in Madras Red sheep. Male lambs are initially identified at 3 month of age and are finally selected after first shearing. Selected male lambs from improver flocks are supplied for breeding to base flocks. Breeding rams of high breeding value are produced from farm based unit every year for germplasm distribution. During the XI plan period about 900 improved breeding rams/ram lambs from five Farm Based Units were sold to different farmers/ State Govt/ NGOs for breed improvement programme and about 700 breeding rams / ram lambs were distributed in three Field Based Units for improvement of farmers flock. The Sheep Improvement Programmes will continue and efforts will be made to bring overall improvement in sheep productivity through distribution of superior germplasm and adoption of improved scientific management practices. Technological developments Merino Sheep Magra Sheep Flock 4 breeds of sheep, in the illustrated encyclopedia Meyers Konversationslexikon CSWRI is credited with scientific animal husbandry efforts in the development of new strains of sheep for wool production such as Avikalin sheep for carpet wool production and Bharat Merino sheep for fine wool production in temperate climate.

His work is mainly concerned with non-narrative environments and performances focusing on a specific approach to time, space and body. Since 2016 he is the Artistic Director of the International Festival for computer based art CynetArt in Dresden, Germany.  1980–1991  After studying industrial design he conducted audio-experiments using pipe organs, harmoniums and multiple tape machine environments as well as engaging mainly in drawing. He left East Germany in 1984 for West Germany, where he started to develop the basics of his language in painting, photography and electronic music ...Ulf Langheinrich, The Useless And Fascinated Look, Alessio Galbiati (May 2008). Digimag no. 34. Digicult – Digital Art, Design & Culture In 1988 he moved to Vienna pursuing his activities in his studio in the WUK (Werkstätten und Kulturhaus) which resulted to an exhibition and the publication of a catalogue of his artworks.  1991–2003: Granular-Synthesis  In 1991 in Vienna, he co- founded with Austrian artist Kurt Hentschläger the duo GRANULAR-SYNTHESIS. Their name refers to the technique of \\"granular synthesis\\", they apply to both sound and image, creating a new audiovisual languageChristopher Philips \\"Machine Dreams\\" in Art America, November 1999 In more than a decade they created monumental multimedia installations and performances such as AREAL (1997–2004), FELD (2000), MODELL 5 (1994–2007), NOISEGATE (1998) or the latest POL (1998–2008). Figurative or abstract, immersive and monumental, sometimes interactive, their works were conceived in a theatrical approach and marked a new step in the aesthetic of perception. They toured worldwide in the most prestigious spaces and festivals. Several compilations of GRANULAR-SYNTHESIS works have been released on DVDs and they received the first prize of the International Biennial in Nagoya in 1995 as well as stipendiums in Austria and the USA.  Since 2003: Solo projects  Ulf Langheinrich has been producing a new series of large scale solo projects, among others PERM -an interactive abstract film created for the EVE Interactive Cinema system designed by Pr Jeffrey Shaw (2005), HEMISPHERE (2006), designed for a hemispheric screen (2006) or LAND, a stereoscopic installation commissioned by Liverpool Biennial 2008. His works were shown at various festivals and museums in Europe, Asia, North America and Australia. Featured artist of the Ars Electronica Festival http://www.lentos.at/html/en/469.aspx in 2005, he received a stipendium from Siemens for the creation of his installation WAVEFORM B. The same year, he directed his first full-length film DRIFT in full HD, commissioned by the Australian Centre for the Moving ImageACMI White Noise. Retrieved 28 February 2015. His longstanding interest in combining classical music with electronic music and HD images, led him to compose the score of SINKEN in 1998 -with GRANULAR-SYNTHESIS- for symphonic orchestra and electronic in Dangerous Visions, commissioned and performed by Orchestre National de Lille and New Music French group Art Zoyd. Since this first live experiment, other similar creations followed including MINUS (still with GRANULAR-SYNTHESIS, 2002), and later under his own name, SYNTONY for the Festival d'Art Lyrique of Aix-en-Provence (2005), DRIFT LIVE (2006) again for Wien Modern and KU for TONLAGEN Festival for contemporary music in Dresden in 2010. Many of his works were also created in collaboration with various artists, mostly as models, using a part of their body, as American singer/performer Diamanda Galas was for GRANULAR-SYNTHESIS' work POL (1998), performer Michael Ashcroft for the duo's pieces WE WANT GOD NOW (1995), AREAL (1997) and FORM (2000). Japanese dancer Akemi Takeya -her face- was also the model of GRANULAR- SYNTHESIS masterpiece MODELL 5 (1995) and short piece SWEETHEARTS (1996). Ulf Langheinrich collaborated again with her later, when she asked him to design the audiovisual environment on her two body performances CE_1 and Weathering in 2005–2006. Other collaborations include the series of performances and installations MOVEMENT A (2008), MOVEMENT B (for the opening of the Hong Kong City University School of Creative Media in 2011), MOVEMENT X and MOVEMENT Y (2010) with Japanese dancer Toshiko Oiwa and MOVEMENT C (2012) and MOVEMENT Z (2014) with Chinese dancer Luo Yuebing. He also worked on the music and sound design of the performance \\"N\\" for French choreographer Angelin Preljocaj in 2004 and co-directed the short film SPINTEX with British artist Gina Czarnecki in Ghana in 2008. In 2015 he created the images and collaborated to the lighting design of the opera SOLARIS by Dai Fujikura and Saburo Teshigawara, after Stanislas Lem's novel, premiered at Théâtre des Champs-Élysées and toured at Lille Opera and Lausanne Opera. As composer, he released the CD DEGREES OF AMNESIA (Asphodel Records). In 2013 was published the DVD Visionaries 21: The Aesthetic Of Sensory,http://www.artfilms.co.uk/Detail.aspx?ItemID=5013 featuring his solo works from 2002–2010. Over the last years, besides his artistic activities, Ulf Langheinrich has been appointed to teach in the most prestigious high schools in Europe (HGB University for Graphics and Book Design, Leipzig, FH Salzburg and Le Fresnoy, Studio national des arts contemporains in Tourcoing), as well as in Australia (RMIT in Melbourne) and China (Hong Kong City University School of Creative Media and China University of Art in Hangzhou).

This test series was scheduled quickly, in order to respond in kind to the Soviet resumption of testing after the tacit 1958–1961 test moratorium. Most of these shots were conducted with free-fall bombs dropped from B-52 bomber aircraft. Twenty of these shots were to test new weapons designs; six to test weapons effects; and several shots to confirm the reliability of existing weapons. The Thor missile was also used to lift warheads into near-space to conduct high-altitude nuclear explosion tests; these shots were collectively called Operation Fishbowl. Operation Dominic occurred during a period of high Cold War tension between the United States and the Soviet Union, since the Cuban Bay of Pigs Invasion had occurred not long before. Nikita Khrushchev announced the end of a three-year moratorium on nuclear testing on 30 August 1961, and Soviet tests recommenced on 1 September, initiating a series of tests that included the detonation of Tsar Bomba. President John F. Kennedy responded by authorizing Operation Dominic. It was the largest nuclear weapons testing program ever conducted by the United States and the last atmospheric test series conducted by the U.S., as the Limited Test Ban Treaty was signed in Moscow the following year. The operation was undertaken by Joint Task Force 8. { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" + United States' Dominic series tests and detonations - !style=\\"background:#ffdead;\\"  Name The US, France and Great Britain have code-named their test events, while the USSR and China did not, and therefore have only test numbers (with some exceptions - Soviet peaceful explosions were named). Word translations into English in parentheses unless the name is a proper noun. A dash followed by a number indicates a member of a salvo event. The US also sometimes named the individual explosions in such a salvo test, which results in \\"name1 - 1(with name2)\\". If test is canceled or aborted, then the row data like date and location discloses the intended plans, where known. !style=\\"background:#efefef;\\"  Date time (UT) !style=\\"background:#ffdead;\\"  Local time zone To convert the UT time into standard local, add the number of hours in parentheses to the UT time; for local daylight saving time, add one additional hour. If the result is earlier than 00:00, add 24 hours and subtract 1 from the day; if it is 24:00 or later, subtract 24 hours and add 1 to the day. Historical time zone data obtained from the IANA time zone database. !style=\\"background:#efefef;\\"  Location Rough place name and a latitude/longitude reference; for rocket-carried tests, the launch location is specified before the detonation location, if known. Some locations are extremely accurate; others (like airdrops and space blasts) may be quite inaccurate. \\"~\\" indicates a likely pro-forma rough location, shared with other tests in that same area. !style=\\"background:#ffdead;\\"  Elevation + height Elevation is the ground level at the point directly below the explosion relative to sea level; height is the additional distance added or subtracted by tower, balloon, shaft, tunnel, air drop or other contrivance. For rocket bursts the ground level is \\"N/A\\". In some cases it is not clear if the height is absolute or relative to ground, for example, Plumbbob/John. No number or units indicates the value is unknown, while \\"0\\" means zero. Sorting on this column is by elevation and height added together. !style=\\"background:#efefef;\\"  Delivery Atmospheric, airdrop, balloon, gun, cruise missile, rocket, surface, tower, and barge are all disallowed by the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. Sealed shaft and tunnel are underground, and remained useful under the PTBT. Intentional cratering tests are borderline; they occurred under the treaty, were sometimes protested, and generally overlooked if the test was declared to be a peaceful use. Purpose Include weapons development, weapon effects, safety test, transport safety test, war, science, joint verification and industrial/peaceful, which may be further broken down. !style=\\"background:#efefef;\\"  Device Designations for test items where known, \\"?\\" indicates some uncertainty about the preceding value, nicknames for particular devices in quotes. This category of information is often not officially disclosed. !style=\\"background:#ffdead;\\"  Yield Estimated energy yield in tons, kilotons, and megatons.

Kwame Yamgnane and Florian Bucher (former executives of Epitech).. The school was first opened in Paris in 2013. Out of more than 80,000 candidates in France, 3,000 were selected to complete a four-week intensive computer programming bootcamp called piscine (swimming-pool). Any person older than 18 can register for the piscine after completing the logical reasoning tests on the website. The school does not have any professors, and is open 24/7. The training is inspired by new modern ways to teach which include peer-to-peer pedagogy and project-based learning. The School has been endorsed by many high-profile people in Silicon Valley including Evan Spiegel the co-founder and CEO of Snapchat, Keyvon Beykpour the co-founder and CEO of Periscope, Stewart Butterfield the co-founder and CEO of Slack, Brian Chesky the co-founder and CEO of Airbnb, Tony Fadell the founder and CEO of Nest Labs, Jack Dorsey the co-Founder and CEO of Twitter, Paul Graham, venture capitalist and co-Founder of Y Combinator, Bill Gurley venture capitalist and general partner at Benchmark. The school is a non-profit organization and is entirely free, being funded by billionaire Xavier Niel with hundreds of millions of dollars. All the intellectual property belongs to the students. 42 Silicon Valley is the American campus of 42 chartered as a public-benefit nonprofit corporation in the State of California and has been created and funded by the same team from France, in addition to a new partner, the chief operating officer of the American school and former 42 Paris student Brittany Bir. 42 Silicon Valley opened in summer 2016 in Fremont, California in the San Francisco Bay Area. 42's name is a reference to the science fiction book The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy written by British author Douglas Adams: in the book 42 is the Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything. In addition to the two official campuses in Paris, France and Fremont, California, the school model was adopted in Lyon, Reims, and Mulhouse, France, as well as in Romania, South Africa, Ukraine, Bulgaria, Moldova,French educational model to gamify IT education in Ukraine, Kyiv Post, May 19, 2016 Belgium, Russia, Morocco, the Netherlands, Indonesia, Finland,1337, l'École qui veut former des génies du numérique, Le Monde, September 05, 2018 Germany and the United Arab Emirates with the help and support of 42.  History  French entrepreneur and businessman Xavier Niel who created and funded 42 Announced on March 26, 2013, 42 opened its doors on July 15, 2013 for the selection phase called La Piscine (the swimming-pool). Students who passed the first 'Piscines' started training in November 2013. In an Editorial, Xavier Niel introduced 42, linking the need for it to the state of the French Education. > \\"Today, the French system doesn't work. It is stuck between on one side the > University, which provides training that is not fitting with what the > business world needs but is free and accessible to the largest number. And > on the other side the private universities (écoles privées), expensive, > where the formation is fairly qualitative but leaves the greatest number of > talents on the side of the road, even geniuses, that we could find in > France.\\" On May 17, 2016 42 announced they will open a second campus in Fremont, California. The first selection phase (The \\"Piscine\\") will start on July 11, 2016. Students who passed the first 'Piscines' started training in November 2016.  Campus and Cost  = Paris Campus, France = 42 France is located at 96 Boulevard Bessières, in the 17th arrondissement of Paris. The building was acquired from the State in 2011 for 12.6 million euros. The building extends over an area of 4242 square meters. Pictures of the school architecture are visible on the official website. 42 was designed by IN&EDIT; Architecture agency. = Fremont Campus, USA = Logo of 42 Silicon Valley, the American campus of the school The 42 Silicon Valley building is located at 6600 Dumbarton Circle, in Fremont, California. The building was acquired from DeVry University. The campus is approximately 200,000 sq ft. This campus has 300 spaces in the dormitories (titled \\"Nostromo Dorms,\\" located at 34793 Ardentech Court, Fremont, CA 94555) which are completely free of cost. Like the Paris campus, 42 Silicon Valley was designed by AR architectures. = Cost = There are no tuition fees for the entirety of the program. All the running costs for the 10 first years have been personally funded by Xavier Niel a French entrepreneur and philanthropist who founded the French company Iliad.. The 42 Silicon Valley campus also has free dorms for those who are the most in need.  Application and Admission  The candidates must be 18 years or older. No previous diploma is required. The selection process begins by taking a few online memory and logic tests, which are intended to evaluate an individual's capacity to learn computer programming. After this there is a second selection which is called the \\"Piscine\\" which is an intensive programming session in C programming language which takes place over a period of 4 weeks.  Tuition Style  42 does not have lectures or practical work supervised by teachers. Students carry out projects proposed by the pedagogic team, and are free to organise their own time. The schools are open 24/7. Students help each other and use the Internet for their projects. Students have no time limits in which to complete their projects. They validate the projects by correcting each other's work. Validation of a project increases the level of the students, allowing them to unlock new and more difficult challenges. During their time at the school, students have to undertake internships. To qualify for an internship a student must have validated a certain number of projects and passed five exams. Many entrepreneurs hold conferences at the school. 42 school has also forged partnerships with other schools (business schools, design schools etc.) and the hackathon organisation. Students are able to participate in partnership activities if they wish to.  Academics  After the \\"Piscine\\", training lasts at least three years, and covers the different I.T. jobs linked to development. The beginning of the program is mainly focused on the Unix development environment with the C-language. These software developments are planned through 40 projects such as the implementation of a basic First-person shooter engine, an engine for an online game and a 3D rendering engine (rasterizer) by ray tracing. After that there are a lot of other languages students will see like PHP, C++, OCaml and many others. Some projects can also have free language choice. According to a promotional document about the school program, learning software development is planned through the realization of an arcade game, artificial intelligence or a computer virus. 42 students and people from everywhere in the world can create a new project if they want.

(GMM., E. 1, 15.909, 15, 1001, 15. 1046, 15. 1115, 34.2402, 34. 2547, SML., J 626, etc)\\" in Naigamesha (, ), also known as Harinegameshi, is a goat-headed or deer-headed deity, associated with children. He also appears in Jain as well as Hindu traditions, associated with the war-god Kartikeya and childbirth. Associations Naigamesha is known by a variety of names: Negamesha, Nemesha, Naigameshin, Negamesi, Harinegameshi. The last is translated as \\"Negamesi, the general of Hari (Indra)\\". Another interpretation says that it is derived from harina (deer) and mesha (ram). Naigamesha is the benefactor and protector of children in Jainism. While the Greek satyr Pan is depicted with the lower body of a goat, Naigamesha has a goat head; in both cultures, the goat denotes fertility.Van der Geer pp. 170–171 He is worshipped to beget children. Jain texts Naigamesha (left) looks over Mahavira's birth; the infant Mahavira is held in his mother's arms. Folio from the Kalpa Sutra (1450–1500). According to the Kalpa Sutra, Naigamesha, on the orders of the king of the gods Indra, transferred the embryo of the Tirthankar Mahavira from the womb of the Brahmin (priest class) woman Devananda to the Kshatriya (ruling caste) Trishala, who finally delivers Mahavira. According to the Shvetambara text Neminanathacharita, which recalls the life of the Tirthankar Neminatha, Krishna – a cousin of Neminatha and generally venerated as Hindu deity – worships Naigamesha to beget a son from his second wife Satyabhama; a son who equals his first-born Pradyumna, from his first wife Rukmini. Other texts portray Satyabhama praying to the deity. In Hinduism In Hinduism, Naigamesha is associated with Kartikeya, the god of war. Naigamesha is an epithet and a form of Kartikeya, where he is generally depicted goat-headed. In other instances, Naigamesha is described as the son or brother of the war god. Hindu texts like the Brahmanas, the Grihya sutras and medicinal texts mention a similar deity with a ram head. As a fearsome follower of Kartikeya, Naigamesha was feared and worshipped to ward off evil. later, he evolved into the patron of childbirth. Iconography Depictions of Naigamesha are rare and are generally confined to North India and the pre-third century era. They are many depictions of the deity found in the region around Mathura, dating from the 1st–3rd century.Van der Geer p. 173 Terracotta figurines of Naigamesha from 2nd century BCE to 4th century CE are also been discovered. In a 1st–3rd century depiction from Kankali Tila near Mathura (currently in Mathura Museum), Naigamesha is depicted with a goat's head and short, backward turning horns, a long beard (goatee) and \\"drooping\\" ears. Another sculpture from the 10th–13th century depicts him in the company of Hindu deities. The group of seven Hindu mother-goddesses, the Saptamatrika – who are associated with children – are surrounded by their usual companions Shiva and Ganesha as well as Naigamesha. The goat-features mirror the earlier depiction. In addition, Naigamesha is depicted with three children; one held in his left arm, another seated near his left foot and a third standing near the right leg, which conveys his association with children.Van der Geer pp. 172–3, xxxii Besides his goat-head, Naigamesha may also be shown having a deer head and may be depicted transferring the embryo of Mahavira in narrative panels. He is also depicted as seated on a throne, flanked by children on his lap or shoulders. Female attendants or a goat-headed woman sometimes accompany the god.

It was initially opened in 1917, on land donated by the Frear Family, later expanding to its current size of . The park contains nature trails, as well as tennis courts, a golf course, and an ice rink. History The original donators of the park, the Frear Family, initially lived in France where their name was 'Frere'. When they moved to England to escape turmoil in France due to World War I, the family name was changed to 'Frear'. The park's fountain was created in 1924, and the maintenance facility the year after. The golf course, initially a 9-hole course, was finished in Spring 1931, with the expansion to a full 18 holes coming in 1964. A $1.2 million irrigation system was later added in 2014. Over 46,000 rounds of golf are played at the course each year. The on- site Irish pub / restaurant was established in 1935, and the ice rink in 1980. Attractions The park features a 6,903-yard, 18-hole golf course with a par of 71 strokes. The course was rated as best golf course in the Upper Valley by Hudson Valley Magazine in 2003. The Rensselaer County Men's Golf Tournament and Mayor's Cup are held at the course annually. The park also includes an ice rink that houses both public skating as well as adult and youth ice hockey programs through the Troy Albany Youth Hockey Association. The park's restaurant, Park Pub Catering & Restaurant, after being constructed in 1935, was added onto in the 1980s. The pub serves mainly casual American cuisine such as chicken wings, pizza, and club sandwiches. Also located in the park are tennis courts, softball fields, picnic areas, a playground, a pagoda, and two lakes (Wright and Bradley).

The bill was introduced into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. Background Causes of TBI hospital visits and deaths in the USCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (2006). January 2006 Update: Traumatic Brain Injury in the United States: Emergency Department Visits, Hospitalizations, and Deaths. (PDF) Retrieved 2008-01-15. Traumatic brain injury is defined as damage to the brain resulting from external mechanical force, such as rapid acceleration or deceleration, impact, blast waves, or penetration by a projectile. Brain function is temporarily or permanently impaired and structural damage may or may not be detectable with current technology. The most common causes of TBI in the U.S. include violence, transportation accidents, construction, and sports. Motor bikes are major causes, increasing in significance in developing countries as other causes reduce. The estimates that between 1.6 and 3.8 million traumatic brain injuries each year are a result of sports and recreation activities in the US. In children aged two to four, falls are the most common cause of TBI, while in older children traffic accidents compete with falls for this position.Granacher (2007). p.16. TBI is the third most common injury to result from child abuse. Abuse causes 19% of cases of pediatric brain trauma, and the death rate is higher among these cases. Domestic violence is another cause of TBI, as are work-related and industrial accidents. Firearms and blast injuries from explosions are other causes of TBI, which is the leading cause of death and disability in war zones. According to Representative Bill Pascrell (Democrat, NJ), TBI is \\"the signature injury of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\\" Legislation regarding funding for tracking traumatic brain injuries was first passed in 1996 and then reauthorized in both 2000 and 2008. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Traumatic Brain Injury Reauthorization Act of 2013 would amend the Public Health Service Act to reauthorize appropriations for FY2014-FY2018 for: (1) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) projects to reduce the incidence of traumatic brain injury, and (2) traumatic brain injury surveillance systems or registries. The bill would reauthorize through FY2018 programs of grants to: (1) states and American Indian consortia for projects to improve access to rehabilitation and other services regarding traumatic brain injury, and (2) protection and advocacy systems for the purpose of enabling such systems to provide services to individuals with traumatic brain injury. The bill would remove the Administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration as agent for the United States Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) in administering these programs. The bill would vest responsibility for administering the programs solely in the Secretary. The bill would reauthorize through FY2018 the comprehensive program of research on trauma carried out by the Secretary, acting through the Director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce on December 11, 2013. This is a public domain source. H.R. 1098 would amend provisions of the Public Health Service Act that authorize the United States Department of Health and Human Services to conduct activities related to traumatic brain injury. Those activities, including the study and surveillance of traumatic brain injury and the awarding of grants that support access to services, are carried out by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). The bill would authorize the appropriation of about $16 million annually for fiscal years 2014 through 2018 for activities related to traumatic brain injury. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that implementing the bill would cost about $74 million over the 2014-2019 period, assuming appropriation of the authorized amounts. Pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply to this legislation because it would not affect direct spending or revenues. The bill contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act. Procedural history The Traumatic Brain Injury Reauthorization Act of 2013 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on March 12, 2013 by Rep. Bill Pascrell Jr. (D, NJ-9). The bill was referred to the United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce and the United States House Energy Subcommittee on Health. The committee agreed in a voice vote to approve the bill. The bill was reported (amended) by the committee on May 20, 2014 alongside House Report 113-456. Debate and discussion The National Association of State Head Injury Administrators (NASHIA) supported the bill, calling the programs supported by the bill \\"critical in helping states to address\\" the unique needs of individuals with traumatic brain injuries. NASHIA supported the bill for allowing states their own flexibility to address needs in their own states and applauded the CDC's work in public education, trying to prevent bad falls by the elderly, and trying to stop sports related traumatic brain injuries.

She was also investigated for the disappearance of another child. O'Dell regularly traveled with the corpses. The bodies of the three dead newborns were found in May 2003 in a storage shed O'Dell rented and abandoned in Safford, Arizona. By all accounts, she murdered them because they were illegitimate. O'Dell told police the babies died at birth between 1981 and 1984. She kept the three babies in a storage unit for over ten years. When she defaulted on her rent, her landlord cleared out her possessions and discovered the corpses. The case became known as 'The Babies in Boxes Murder Case'.

History and architecture  The castle was built on the banks of la grande Sauldre in the Pays-Fort, near the Sancerrois in the ancient Boisbelle principality. =Middle-ages= Its name comes from the Boucard family (or Boucart) from Gascony, who became landowners in the Berry, after the wedding of Jean de Boucart with Anne de Blancafort at the end of the 14th century. Shortly after their settlement, the castle was built on an ancient feudal mound (Motte du Plessis) by Lancelot de Boucart. The castle has kept its medieval styled châtelet entrance, outer walls and angled towers.Base Mérimée =Renaissance= The château as we know it today is due for the most part to Antoine de Boucard, gentilhomme of the house of François Ier, soldier of the Italian wars, who built a new dwelling on the yard's southern angle, around 1520, in Renaissance style. One of his descendants, François de Boucard, rebuilt the wing in 1560. On the façade is written the castle's motto « Victrix patentia fatia » (patience, destiny's winner). =Modern times= From 1671 to 1674, Louis XIV assigned Philippe de Montaut-Bénac de Navailles to reside with Boucard, who opened the yard up on the Sauldre and arranged the first floor of the northern wing. The gardening plan was assigned by Dosmont, pupil of the King's architect Jean-Michel Chevotet, to fermier général Étienne Perrinet de Jars who became owner of the castle in 1760.Le Journal de Gien - 10 avril 2009 The family still owned the castle, but gradually lost interest; the domain was progressively abandoned during the 19th century, to become only a site dedicated to hunting. =20th century restoration= In the 1920s, Charles-Auguste de Bryas, descendant of the Vogüé family inherited the castle. His wife, Hélène de Bryas (born La Rochefoucauld) rediscovered the castle and the gardens threatening to fall into ruins, restored them to render the domain habitable. The family sojourned namely during World War II. In the 1960s, the château was acquired by its present owner, Marie-Henriette de Montabert, daughter of Hélène de Brias, who opened it to the public and made it a stage of la Route Jacques-Cœur in 1965. The castle and its dependencies, the parks and gardens, moats, canals and bridges allowed a ranking title of Monument historique on July 10, 1995.

It was formerly known as MapsWithMe. In November 2014, it was acquired by Mail.Ru Group and became part of its My.com brand. In September 2015, the app was open sourced. First, the whole team has developed an application in Belarus and Switzerland. Maps.me was founded by Yury Melnichek, Alexander Borsuk, Viktor Govako and Siarhei Rachytski. Under the leadership of Alexander, MapsWithMe got its first 2.5M users worldwide. Yury Melnichek was leading the project from November 2013 until April 2016 when Evgeny Lisovskiy took over. In early 2017 the philosophy of the app changed, leading it to be supported by unobtrusive adverts.

She is currently the Percy K. and Vida L. W. Hudson Professor of Computer Science at Columbia University. Biography Julia Linn Bell Hirschberg received her first Ph.D degree in History (16th-century Mexico) from University of Michigan in 1976. She served on the History faculty of Smith College from 1974 to 1982. She subsequently shifted to Computer Science studies, receiving her M.S. in Computer and Information Science from University of Pennsylvania in 1982 and a Ph.D in Computer and Information Science from University of Pennsylvania in 1985. Upon graduation from University of Pennsylvania in 1985, Hirschberg joined AT&T; Bell Labs as a Member of Technical staff in the Linguistics Research Department, where she worked on improving prosody assignment for Text-to-Speech Synthesis (TTS) in the Bell Labs TTS system. She was promoted to Department Head in 1994 when she created a new Human Computer Interface Research Lab. She and her department remained at Bell Labs until 1996 when they moved to AT&T; Labs Research as part of a corporate reorganization. In 2002, she joined the Columbia University faculty as a Professor in the Department of Computer Science. She served as Chair of the Computer Science Department from 2012-2018.  Research  Hirschberg's research has included prosody, discourse structure, spoken dialogue systems, speech search, and more recently analysis of deceptive speech. Hirschberg was among the first to combine Natural Language Processing (NLP) approaches to discourse and dialogue with speech research. She pioneered techniques in text analysis for prosody assignment in Text-to-Speech synthesis at Bell laboratories in the 1980s and 1990s, developing corpus-based statistical models based upon syntactic and discourse information which are in general use today in TTS systems. With Janet Pierrehumbert, she developed a theoretical model of intonational meaning. She was a leader in the development of the ToBI conventions for intonational description, which have been extended to numerous languages and which today are the most widely used standard for intonational annotation. Hirschberg has been a pioneer together with Gregory Ward in much experimental work on intonational sources of language meaning and how these interact with pragmatic phenomena, particularly on the meaning of accent (intonational prominent) items and the meaning of intonational contours. She also has innovated in numerous other areas involving prosody and meaning, including the role of grammatical function and surface position in pitch accent location, the use of prosody in disambiguating cue phrases (discourse markers) with Diane Litman, the role of prosody in disambiguation in English, Italian, and Spanish with Cinzia Avesani and Pilar Prieto, and the automatic identification of speech recognition errors using prosodic information, At AT&T; Labs she worked with Fernando Pereira, Steve Whittaker, and others on speech search and developing new interfaces for speech navigation. At Columbia, she and her students have continued and extended research on spoken dialogue systems (automatically detecting speech recognition errors and inappropriate system queries, modeling turn-taking behavior, dialogue entrainment, modeling and generating clarification dialogues); on the automatic classification of trust, charisma, deception and emotion from speech; on speech summarization; prosody translation, hedging behavior in text and speech, text-to-speech synthesis, and speech search in low resource languages. She also holds several patents in TTS and in speech search. Corpora she and collaborators have collected include the Boston Directions Corpus, the Columbia SRI Colorado Deception Corpus, and the Columbia Games Corpus. She has served on numerous technical boards and editorial committees, and is now on the Computing Research Association's (CRA) Board of Directors and serves as co-chair of CRA-W. She is also noted for her leadership in broadening participation in computing. She has served as a member of the CRA Committee on the Status of Women in Computing Research CRA-W since 2010.

Sonnenfeldt is the President of the Goldman-Sonnenfeldt Foundation and on the Boards of several other philanthropic and political organizations. Education Michael Sonnenfeldt attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) from 1974 to 1978, where he received Bachelor's and master's degrees in Management. He is a member of the Phi Beta Kappa Society. Awards Sonnenfeldt was awarded a degree of Doctor Philosophiae Honoris Causa from the Ben Gurion University of the Negev in 1995. Career =Early career= After graduating from MIT, Sonnenfeldt began his career as an Associate at Goldman Sachs, from 1978-1979, in the Merger & Acquisitions Department and then transitioned to the Goldman Sachs Realty Corp. In 1980, Sonnenfeldt conceived and initiated the then- largest commercial renovation in the country. With his partner, David Fromer, he transformed the 2.4 million square foot Harborside Terminal in Jersey City, New Jersey into The Harborside Financial Center. He and Fromer spearheaded the development team of over 100 professionals working on the project. Sonnenfeldt and Fromer sold The Harborside Financial Center in 1986 for over $100 million to a major US pension fund in what is considered to be one of the most successful real estate deals in the history of the New York metropolitan area. The Harborside Financial Center continues to operate as one of the top- performing assets in the New Jersey marketplace. At the time, the complex was believed to be the most valuable single commercial real estate asset in the state of New Jersey.

The two man wet SDVs are used for transporting naval commandos into hostile waters where they would perform sabotage on enemy warships and coastal installations. Weapons at their disposal included limpet mines. With the start of the Croatian War of Independence SDVs in service with the Yugoslav Navy were relocated to FR Yugoslavia. Two new vehicles were completed for the Croatian Navy during the 1990s while a small number these vehicles were also exported to Syria and Sweden before the war.  Description  Developed by the Brodarski institut (BI) from Zagreb, the R-2 Mala swimmer delivery vehicles were designed for transporting naval special forces armed with two limpet mines inside enemy- controlled waters. After reaching their area of operations, the divers would anchor the vehicle and continue on their own by swimming until they reached their targets which included warships in port or other coastal installations. The SDVs were constructed from aluminium and plexiglass, utilizing an enclosed wet crew compartment. Propulsion consisted of a single electric engine mounted on a single shaft, enabling them a maximum speed of and a cruising speed of . Moving at their maximum speed they have a range of increasing to if travelling at their cruise speed. Normal operating depth is between while the maximum test depth is . Without the divers and their armament the vehicles displace .  Service  Although the exact date of when production started is unknown, it appears that a total of 18 SDVs were produced, the last ones being built in 1994 for the Croatian Navy. In service with the Yugoslav Navy (JRM) the Malas were operated by the naval special forces of 82nd Naval Center. An unknown number of vehicles were exported to Sweden and possibly Syria. With the start of the Croatian War of Independence the majority of Yugoslav Navy's inventory was relocated to Montenegro, including the R-2 Malas. Although Conways's All of the World's Fighting Ships 1947-1995 reported that two vehicles were captured by Croatia in 1992, it is possible that the two SDVs still in use by Croatia are in fact new ones that were built in 1994 after the start of the war. Interior of a Croatian R-2M Mala photographed in 2010 Vehicles in service with Serbia and Montenegro were later passed on to Montenegro when the country declared independence in 2006. In 2009 a single R-1 and R-2 Mala were donated to the Porto Montenegro museum in Tivat. A document from 2011 revealed that the Armed Forces of Montenegro possessed twelve R-1s and four R-2 Malas, all of which were nonoperational due to the expired lifetime of their batteries and were declared redundant. Again, one of each vehicles were donated by the Montenegrin government to the Association of professional divers of Montenegro for use in their diving museum. An article from 2010 revealed that the Armed Forces of Croatia operated two vehicles assigned to the Special Operations Battalion's 3rd Company that specialises in amphibious warfare. The vehicles are designated R-2M and were modernised sometime during 2009 improving their range and digitalizing the navigation system. Before that the vehicles were out of service for seven years.

She has worked on a number of high-profile cases involving allegations of human rights injustices. Her work with Gerry Conlon and the Guildford Four – wrongly convicted of bombings carried out by the Provisional Irish Republican Army – was chronicled in the film In the Name of the Father (1993), in which she was portrayed by Emma Thompson. Early life Peirce was born in March 1940 in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, the daughter of Margaret (née Twidell) and John Le Plastrier Webb. She changed her name from Jean to \\"Gareth\\" during her formative years. Her parents ran Bentham Grammar School in North Yorkshire, which she attended until she took her O-levels. She was subsequently educated at the Cheltenham Ladies' College, the University of Oxford and the London School of Economics. Career In the 1960s, she worked as a journalist in the United States, following the campaign of Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. Married, she returned to Britain in 1970 with her husband and elder son and undertook her postgraduate law degree at the London School of Economics. Her younger son was born in London after her permanent return to England. In 1974, she joined the law firm of solicitor Benedict Birnberg as a trainee, being admitted to the Roll of Solicitors on 15 December 1978. Following Birnberg's retirement in 1999, she continued to work as a senior partner of Birnberg Peirce and Partners. In the mid-1970s, she supported specific campaigns for legal reforms of police procedures that permitted the prosecution and conviction of persons based solely on identification evidence. Individual cases then very much in the news led to the establishment of Justice Against the Identification Laws (JAIL), an organisation which Gareth Peirce supports. During her career she represented Judith Ward, who had been wrongfully convicted in 1974 of several IRA-related bombings, the Guildford Four, the Birmingham Six, several mineworkers after the Battle of Orgreave, the family of Jean Charles de Menezes and Moazzam Begg, a man held in extrajudicial detention by the American government. Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, appointed Peirce as his solicitor in Swedish Judicial Authority v Julian Assange. Of her defence of Muslim suspects accused of terrorism, Peirce has said: > We have lost our way in this country. We have entered a new dark age of > injustice and it is frightening that we are overwhelmed by it. I know I am > representing innocent people; innocent people who know that a jury they face > will inevitably be predisposed to find them guilty. Recognition and reception Peirce's role in the defence of the Guildford Four was dramatised in the 1993 film, In the Name of the Father, with Peirce portrayed by Emma Thompson. Peirce has reportedly never watched the film, and stated in 1995 that she was \\"an extremely unimportant participant in the story\\" but was \\"given a seemingly important status\\". She was appointed CBE in 1999 for services to justice, but later wrote to Downing Street asking for it to be withdrawn and tendering an apology for any misunderstanding. Sir Ludovic Kennedy, a campaigner against miscarriages of justice, dedicated a book to Peirce, calling her \\"the doyenne of British defence lawyers\\" who \\"refuses to be defeated in any case no matter how unfavourable it looks\\". Benedict Birnberg, who first employed her as a solicitor, believes she has \\"transformed the criminal justice scene in this country almost single-handedly\\". Peirce was one of the initial eight individuals inducted in March 2007 into Justice Denied magazine's Hall of Honor for her lifetime achievement in aiding the wrongly convicted. In 1999, she was awarded an honorary doctorate by NUI Galway. In 2015 she was awarded the Presidential Distinguished Service Award by Michael D. Higgins, the President of Ireland. Personal life Peirce has been described as a very private person who shuns the limelight and refuses media interviews. She lives in Kentish Town, North London, with her husband, Mellen Chamberlain \\"Bill\\" Peirce, a writer and photographer, son of American painter Waldo Peirce. They have two sons.

Foundations Vladimir Lenin (Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov) popularised political vanguardism as conceptualised by Karl Kautsky, detailing his thoughts in one of his earlier works, What is to be done? Lenin argued that Marxism's complexity and the hostility of the establishment (the autocratic, semi-feudal state of Imperial Russia) required a close-knit group of individuals pulled from the working class vanguard to safeguard the revolutionary ideology within the particular circumstances presented by the Tsarist régime at the time. While Lenin wished for a revolutionary organisation akin to the contemporary Social Democratic Party of Germany, which was open to the public and more democratic in organisation, the Russian autocracy prevented this. Leninists argue that Lenin's ideal vanguard party would be one where membership is completely open: \\"The members of the Party are they who accept the principles of the Party programme and render the Party all possible support.\\"Vladimir Lenin, What is to be Done? ch.IV, quoting Clause 1 of the Rules of the German Social- Democratic Party This party could, in theory, be completely transparent: the \\"entire political arena is as open to the public view as is a theatre stage to the audience\\".Vladimir Lenin, What is to be Done? ch.IV A party that supposedly implemented democracy to such an extent that \\"the general control (in the literal sense of the term) exercised over every act of a party man in the political field brings into existence an automatically operating mechanism which produces what in biology is called the \\"survival of the fittest\\"\\". This party would be completely open to the public eye as it conducted its business which would mainly consist of educating the proletariat to remove the false consciousness that had been instilled in them.Vladimir Lenin, What is to be Done? In its first phase, the vanguard party would exist for two reasons. Firstly, it would protect Marxism from outside corruption from other ideas as well as advance its concepts. Secondly, it would educate the proletariat in Marxism in order to cleanse them of their \\"false individual consciousness\\" and instill the revolutionary \\"class consciousness\\" in them. If the party is successful in this goal, on the eve of revolution, a critical mass of the working class population would be prepared to usher forth the transformation of society. Furthermore, a great number of them, namely their most dedicated members, would belong to the party cadres as professional revolutionaries, and would be elected to leadership positions by the mass party membership. Thus the organisation would quickly include the entire working class.Vladimir Lenin, What is to be Done? Once the proletariat gained class consciousness and thus was prepared to revolt against the ruling classes, the vanguard party would serve another purpose. The party would coordinate the proletariat through its revolution by acting as a military command hub of sorts. This is, according to Leninists, a vital function as mass revolutions can sometimes be easily crushed by the disciplined military of the ruling classes. The vanguards would serve as commanders of the revolt, chosen to their positions by \\"democratic natural selection\\". In Lenin's view, after the revolution the working class would implement the dictatorship of the proletariat to rule the new worker's state through the first phase of communism, socialism. Here it can be said that the vanguard disappears, as all of society now consists of revolutionaries. Political party A vanguard party is a political party at the fore of a mass-action political movement and of a revolution. In the praxis of political science, the concept of the vanguard party, composed of professional revolutionaries, was first effected by the Bolshevik Party in the Russian Revolution of 1917. Lenin, the first leader of the Bolsheviks, coined the term vanguard party, and argued that such a party was necessary in order to provide the practical and political leadership that would impel the proletariat to achieve a communist revolution. Hence, as a political-science concept and term, vanguard party most often is associated with Leninism; however, similar concepts (under different names) also are present in other revolutionary ideologies. Friedrich Engels and Karl Marx presented the concept of the vanguard party as solely qualified to politically lead the proletariat in revolution; in Chapter II: \\"Proletarians and Communists\\" of The Communist Manifesto (1848), they said: > The Communists, therefore, are, on the one hand, practically the most > advanced and resolute section of the working-class parties of every country, > that section which pushes forward all others; on the other hand, > theoretically, they have over the great mass of the proletariat the > advantage of clearly understanding the lines of march, the conditions, and > the ultimate general results of the proletarian movement. The immediate aim > of the Communists is the same as that of all other proletarian parties: > Formation of the proletariat into a class, overthrow of the bourgeois > supremacy, conquest of political power by the proletariat. According to Lenin, the purpose of the vanguard party is to establish a dictatorship of the proletariat; a rule of the working class. The change of ruling class, from the bourgeoisie to the proletariat, makes possible the full development of socialism. In early 20th-century Russia, Lenin argued that the vanguard party would lead the revolution to depose the incumbent Tsarist government, and transfer government power to the working class.Townson, D. The New Penguin Dictionary of Modern History: 1789–1945 London:1994 pp. 462–464 In the pamphlet What is to be Done? (1902), Lenin said that a revolutionary vanguard party, mostly recruited from the working class, should lead the political campaign, because it was the only way that the proletariat could successfully achieve a revolution; unlike the economist campaign of trade union struggle advocated by other socialist political parties and later by the anarcho-syndicalists. Like Karl Marx, Lenin distinguished between the two aspects of a revolution, the economic campaign (labour strikes for increased wages and work concessions), which featured diffused plural leadership; and the political campaign (socialist changes to society), which featured the decisive revolutionary leadership of the Bolshevik vanguard party. =Marxism–Leninism= As he surveyed the European milieu in the late 1890s, Lenin found several theoretic problems with the Marxism of the late 19th century. Contrary to what Karl Marx had predicted, capitalism had become stronger in the last third of the 19th century. In Western Europe, the working class had become poorer, rather than becoming politically progressive, thinking people; hence, the workers and their trade unions, although they had continued to militate for better wages and working conditions, had failed to develop a revolutionary class consciousness, as predicted by Marx. To explain that undeveloped political awareness, Lenin said that the division of labour in a bourgeois capitalist society prevented the emergence of a proletarian class consciousness, because of the ten-to-twelve-hour workdays that the workers laboured in factories, and so had no time to learn and apply the philosophic complexities of Marxist theory. Finally, in trying to effect a revolution in Tsarist Imperial Russia (1721–1917), Lenin faced the problem of an autocratic régime that had outlawed almost all political activity. Although the Tsarist autocracy could not enforce a ban on political ideas, until 1905—when Tsar Nicholas II (ruled 1894–1917) agreed to the formation of a national duma—the Okhrana, the Tsarist secret police, suppressed every political group seeking social and political changes, including those with a democratic program. To counter such political conditions, Lenin said that a professional revolutionary organisation was necessary to organise and lead the most class-conscious workers into a politically coherent movement. Concerning the Russian class struggle, in the book What Is to Be Done? (1902), against the \\"economist\\" trend of the socialist parties (who proposed that the working class would develop a revolutionary consciousness from demanding solely economic improvements), Lenin said that the \\"history of all countries bears out the fact that, through their own powers alone, the working class can develop only a trade-union consciousness\\"; and that under reformist, trade- union leadership, the working class could only engage spontaneous local rebellions to improve their political position within the capitalist system, and that revolutionary consciousness developed unevenly. Nonetheless, optimistic about the working class's ability to develop a revolutionary class consciousness, Lenin said that the missing element for escalating the class struggle to revolution was a political organisation that could relate to the radicalism of political vanguard of the working class, who then would attract many workers from the middling policies of the reformist leaders of the trade unions. It is often believed that Lenin thought the bearers of class consciousness were the common intellectuals who made it their vocation to conspire against the capitalist system, educate the public in revolutionary theory, and prepare the workers for the proletarian revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat that would follow. Yet, unlike his Menshevik rivals, Lenin distinguished himself by his hostility towards the bourgeois intelligentsia, and was routinely criticised for placing too much trust in the intellectual ability of the working class to transform society through its own political struggles. Like other political organisations that sought to change Imperial Russian society, Lenin's Bolshevik Party resorted to conspiracy, and operated in the political underground. Against Tsarist repression, Lenin argued for the necessity of confining membership to people who were professionally trained to combat the Okhrana secret police; however, at its core, the Bolshevik Party was an exceptionally flexible organisation who pragmatically adapted policy to changing political situations. After the Revolution of 1905, Lenin proposed that the Bolshevik Party \\"open its gates\\" to the militant working class, who were rapidly becoming political radicals, in order for the Party to become a mass-action political party with genuine roots in the working class movement. The notion of a 'vanguard', as used by Lenin before 1917, did not necessarily imply single-party rule. Lenin considered the Social-Democrats (Bolsheviks) the leading elements of a multi- class (and multi-party) democratic struggle against Tsarism.Paul LeBlanc. Lenin and the Revolutionary Party. Humanities Press International, 1990. p.49. Even after the October Revolution, the Bolsheviks (now renamed the Communist Party) operated in the Soviets, trade unions, and other working-class mass organisations in a milieu with other revolutionary parties, such as Mensheviks, Social-Revolutionaries and anarcho-communists, and local soviets often elected non-Bolshevik majorities.Victor Serge. Year One of the Russian Revolution. p.243. In this context, Lenin considered the Bolsheviks the vanguard insofar as they were the most consistent defenders of Soviet power (which he considered the dictatorship of the proletariat or 'Commune- state').Paul LeBlanc. Lenin and the Revolutionary Party. Humanities Press International, 1990. p.260. However, this situation changed drastically during the Russian Civil War and economic collapse, which decimated the working class and its independent institutions, and saw the development of irreconcilable conflicts between the Bolsheviks and their rivals. At the 10th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in 1921, the Party made the de facto reality de jure by outlawing opposition parties and formalising single-Party rule.Paul LeBlanc. Lenin and the Revolutionary Party. Humanities Press International, 1990. p.306. Thus, the concept of a vanguard party was used by the Bolsheviks to justify their suppression of other parties. They took the line that since they were the vanguard of the proletariat, their right to rule could not be legitimately questioned. Hence, opposition parties could not be permitted to exist. From 1936 onward, Communist-inspired state constitutions enshrined this concept by giving the Communist parties a \\"leading role\\" in society—a provision that was interpreted to either ban other parties altogether or force them to accept the Communists' guaranteed right to rule as a condition of being allowed to exist. In the 20th century, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) continued regarding itself as the institutionalisation of Marxist–Leninist political consciousness in the Soviet Union; therein lay the justification for its political control of Soviet society. Article 6 of the 1977 Soviet Constitution refers to the CPSU as the \\"leading and guiding force of Soviet society, and the nucleus of its political system, of all state organizations and public organizations\\". The CPSU, precisely because it was the bearer of Marxist–Leninist ideology, determined the general development of society, directed domestic and foreign policy, and \\"imparts a planned, systematic, and theoretically substantiated character\\" to the struggle of the Soviet people for the victory of communism. Nonetheless, the political role of the vanguard party, as outlined by Lenin, is disputed among the contemporary communist movement. Lenin's contemporary in the Bolshevik Party, Leon Trotsky, further developed and established the vanguard party with the creation of the Fourth International. Trotsky, who believed in permanent revolution, proposed that a vanguard party must be an international political party who organised the most militant activists of the working classes of the countries of the world. =Other uses= Although Lenin honed the idea in terms of a class leadership forged out of a proletarian vanguard specifically to describe Marxist–Leninist parties,Jonathan Joseph, Hegemony: A Realist Analysis, Routledge 2002 p.45. the term is also used for many kinds of movement conceiving themselves as initially guided by a small elite. Theodor Herzl, the theorist of Zionism, thought legitimation from the majority would only hinder from the outset his movement, and therefore advised that \\"we cannot all be of one mind; the gestor will therefore simply take the leadership into his hands and march in the van.\\" This principle antedated by some years the Leninist idea of Bolshevism as the vanguard of the revolution by characterizing the 'Zionist movement as a vanguard of the Jewish people.'David Biale, Power & Powerlessness in Jewish History, (1986) Random House 2010 p.136. The Youth Guard at the forefront of Zionist mobilization in the Yishuv likewise conceived of itself as a revolutionary vanguard,Sasson Sofer, Zionism and the Foundations of Israeli Diplomacy, 1998 pp.160-178, p.160. and the kibbutz movement itself is said to have thought of itself as a 'selfless vanguard'.Joshua Muravchik, Heaven On Earth: The Rise and Fall of Socialism, Encounter Books, 2013 p.263. It is occasionally used with of certain Islamist parties. Writers Abul Ala Maududi and Sayyid Qutb both urged the formation of an Islamic vanguard to restore Islamic society. Qutb talked of an Islamist vanguard in his book Ma'alim fi al-Tariq (Milestones)Fundamentalist Islam at Large: The Drive for Power by Martin Kramer, Middle East Quarterly, June 1996 and Maududi formed the radical Islamist party Jamaat-e-IslamiGlobalSecurity.org: Jamaat-e-Islami in Pakistan whose goal was to establish a pan-Ummah worldwide Islamist ideological state starting from Pakistan, administered for God solely by Muslims \\"whose whole life is devoted to the observance and enforcement\\" of Islamic law (Shari'ah), leading to the world becoming the House of Islam. The party members formed an elite group (called arkan) with \\"affiliates\\" (mutaffiq) and then \\"sympathizers\\" (hamdard) beneath them. Today, the JI has spread wings to other South Asian countries with large Muslim populations, such as Afghanistan, Bangladesh and India. The literature of the Baháʼí Faith also makes frequently refers to those serving to raise the capacities of communities around the world as the \\"vanguard\\" of the Cause of Baha'u'llah Bahá’í Reference Library, 2019. According to Roger Eatwell, some fascist parties have also operated in ways similar to the concept of a vanguard party.Roger Eatwell. Fascism: a history. Allen Lane, 1996. p. 215.

Born to a transmigrant father in Sumatra, from a young age he showed interest in the visual arts but was taught to be a teacher. After a short time at a Taman Siswa school in Batavia (now Jakarta), he studied design and worked as a surveyor while producing sketches and book covers. He only acted in a single film, Kedok Ketawa, but remained close to the acting community, first as a set designer during the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies then for Perfini in the early 1950s. During the 1940s and 50s Resobowo became recognised as a painter, working with such artists as Trisno Sumardjo and Oesman Effandi. By the late 1950s he was head of the visual arts department of the Institute for the People's Culture. However, the political climate of Indonesia soon made Resobowo's leftist leanings dangerous, and he went into exile beginning in the 1960s, ultimately settling in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. There he wrote extensively on art until his death. Early life Resobowo was born to Prawiroatmojo and his wife, their second child, in 1916. Sources disagree as to where he was born. The Jakarta City Government's Encyclopedia of Jakarta states his place of birth as Palembang, West Sumatra, but Taman Ismail Marzuki's biography of the artists gives a birthplace of Bengkulu, with Palembang and Lampung as locations in which he lived as a child with his transmigrant family. As a child, he enjoyed drawing. In order to become a teacher, Resobowo was sent to live with his uncle in the capital of the Dutch East Indies, Batavia (now Jakarta). There he attended a Dutch-run school for indigenes, the Europesche Largere School. After graduating, in 1930 Resobowo was sent to live with another uncle and started his studies at a Dutch-run middle school, or MULO. However, in his second year he moved to Yogyakarta, where he completed his education in a Taman Siswa-run school and was primed to be a teacher. One of his classmates in Yogyakarta was Sindoesoedarsono Soedjojono, and the two often painted together. Resobowo returned to Batavia in 1933 and, for a short while, served as a teacher at a Taman Siswa school there. This return was only temporary, however, as between 1936 and 1938 he lived in Bandung, West Java, and studied design at a school established by the architect Ir. Rooseno. While in that city, Resobowo was active with the social organization Indonesia Muda, becoming the head of the Bandung Chapter and attending the group's 1937 conference in Surabaya. Developing career In 1938, Resobowo again returned to Batavia, finding a house in the Tangkiwood area of the city, in which many of the domestic film industry's stars lived. There he met such actors as Roekiah and her husband Kartolo; Resobowo, together with S. Toetoer, drew a portrait of her. Over the next several years Resobowo served as a surveyor in areas such as Sawangan and Pamengpeuk. In the meantime, he remained active in the visual arts, becoming a member of the Indonesian Visual Artists' Association ( or PERSAGI) and designing book covers, including to Armijn Pane's translation of Door Duisternis tot Licht (Out of the Darkness Comes the Light), a collection of Kartini's letters. Resobowo (left) in a scene from Kedok Ketawa Union Films, a company established by ethnic Chinese businessmen, signed Resobowo to act in their first film, Kedok Ketawa, in 1941. Resobowo was cast as the painter Basuki, who must work with the \\"Laughing Mask\\" in order to save his lover Minarsih from a lecherous rich man. The studio emphasised Resobowo's education in order to draw audiences. Although this film was a critical success, Union's subsequent releases — beginning with Harta Berdarah (1941) - did not include Resobowo. During the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies, which lasted from 1942 and 1945, Resobowo spent time working for the visual arts division of the Cultural Centre (in Indonesian, ; in Japanese, ), where he was tasked with writing radio broadcasts regarding the visual arts. However, he left this position in order to handle stage decor for various acting troupes, including Bintang Surabaya, Fifi Young's Pagoda, and Tjahaja Timur. While doing the decor for these troupes he would often travel with them, and in his spare time he would sketch their stars. He won best painting at a Cultural Centre competition in 1943, and as such he was compared to Basuki Abdullah and Affandi. Indonesian independence Indonesia proclaimed its independence on 17 August 1945, and Resobowo worked to spread this news. Together with M. Balfas, he designed posters related to Indonesian independence which he spread through the kampung of Jakarta (renamed during the occupation). He was also a member of the Menteng 31 group. However, when the returning Dutch colonial forces forced the republican government out of Jakarta in 1946, Resobowo left the city. He spent the remainder of the Indonesian National Revolution (1945–1949) in cities such as Yogyakarta, Madiun (where he sketched Lake Sarangan), and Sukabumi. When he was living in Madiun he worked with Sudjojono, Sudibio, and Trisno Sumardjo to establish the Young Indonesian Artists (, or SIM); he remained active with this group even after moving to Surakarta and Yogyakarta. After the end of the revolution, Resobowo worked regularly with Trisno Sumardjo, Oesman Effandi, and Zaini. The painters held exhibitions in several cities, including Yogyakarta in 1952, Padang, Medan, and Bali. The four, as well as several other artists, were also commissioned to sketch historical figures for schoolbooks by the Familij Sarekat Compagnij. Meanwhile, Resobowo joined Usmar Ismail's film company Perfini. Beginning with Darah dan Doa (1950), Resobowo became production designer; he also assisted Sitor Situmorang in polishing the script. With the company's next production, Embun (1951), Resobowo again worked on the script, the majority of which was penned by director D. Djajakusuma. For three further films, Enam Djam di Djogdja (1951), Dosa Tak Berampun (1951), and Terimalah Laguku (1952), he again served as artistic director. For his last film with the company, Tamu Agung (1955), Resobowo adapted Nikolai Gogol's The Government Inspector into an Indonesian context: the film focuses on the anticipation of the visit of a dignitary to a small isolated village in East Java. In 1955 Resobowo ran in the legislative election, running for the Communist Party of Indonesia (, or PKI). Towards the end of the 1950s, Resobowo was selected to head the visual arts department of the Institute for the People's Culture (, or Lekra), a leftists organisation active in the arts and literature. He also contributed articles on the visual arts to such magazines as Budaya, Harian Rakyat, Indonesia, Seniman, Zaman Baru, and Zenith. Life in exile and death Amidst a background of an increasingly unstable political situation in Indonesia, including conflicts between leftists (such as the PKI and Lekra) and rightists such as the military, in 1962 Resobowo left the country for China. The failed G30S coup of 1965, which was blamed on the Communists and followed by an anti-communist purge, left the artist unable to return to Indonesia. He lived in China until 1962, before moving to Germany and ultimately Amsterdam, the Netherlands. During his over thirty years of exile, Resobowo wrote extensively. He published a graphic novel in two volumes, titled Cut Nyak Din, about the Acehnese warrior. He also wrote an autobiography, Riwayat Hidupku, as well as books such as Bercermin Di Muka Kaca and Karmiatun. He never abandoned his leftist leanings, writing in his 1994 book Seniman, Seni, dan Masyarakat (Art, Artists, and Society; the title taken from a 1947 essay by Sudjojono) that politics and art were inseparable, and that artists could only truly serve their society through Marxism. He likewise remained politically active, participating in a hunger strike in 1992 against the threatened executions of Ruslan Wijayasastra and other former PKI members. Resobowo was only able to return to Indonesia in 1998, when he visited the country and met many of its artists. He returned to the Netherlands and died in Amsterdam on 5 January 1999, leaving two children and an ex-wife. Legacy The poet Chairil Anwar dedicated two poems to Resobowo. The first, \\"Sorga\\" (\\"Heaven\\"), was written in Malang on 25 February 1947 and included in Anwar's collection Deru Tjampur Debu. The second, \\"Sajak Buat Basuki Resobowo\\" (\\"A Poem for Basuki Resobowo\\"), was penned three days later and included in the anthology Tiga Menguak Takdir. When HB Jassin compiled Chairil Anwar Pelopor Angkatan '45, these two poems were combined as \\"Dua Sajak Buat Basuki Resobowo\\". English translations of these poems were published by Burton Raffel in 1970. Monash University describes Tamu Agung as \\"brilliantly interweav[ing] modern political discourse (including a militant feminism that appears to have emerged with the Indonesian revolution) with archaic Javanese rhetoric, taken from the narratives of the Wayang (traditional Javanese shadow play)\\". Resobowo's portrait of Soetomo is held in the Presidential Palace in Jakarta. The portrait was completed on government commission.

Early life and education Tong, Liang was born on October 29, 1963 in Dalian, China. Liang studied at Peking University, Beijing, from 1979 to 1983, and earned his bachelor's degree in Chemistry, working in Dr. You-Qi Tang's lab. During his four years at Peking University, he became interested in multiple fields of studies, such as computer science, mathematics, chemistry and biology. It was during the same time that he developed an interest in structural biology, which enabled him to combine his diverse interests to create knowledge. He obtained his PhD (Biophysical Chemistry with focus on protein crystallography) in the United States at University of California Berkeley in 1989, and his mentor at UCB was Dr. Sung-Hou Kim. After earning his PhD degree, Liang worked as a post-doctoral research associate in Dr. Michael G. Rossmann’s lab at Purdue University from 1989 to 1992. During his time at Purdue University, Liang joined the Sigma Xi for his achievement in research. Research and Career Liang started his career working in Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Ridgefield, Connecticut, working as a senior scientist from 1992 to 1995, and as a principal scientist from 1996 to 1997. In 1997, Liang was offered a faculty appointment at the department of biological sciences, Columbia University. Liang has been the department chair of the department of biological sciences since 2013, and he was recently named the William R. Kenan, Jr. Professor in 2015. Until July 2018, Liang has published 239 papers and 38 reviews/book chapters. Robust research in the field of biochemistry and structural biology has been going on the Liang Tong lab, and Liang is a dedicated and productive protein crystallographer. He participated or lead the solving of the structures of proteins and protein complexes including, but not limited to, the heterotrimer core of Saccharomyces cerevisiae AMPK homologue SNF1, 5’-3’ exoribonuclease Rat1 and its activating partner Rai1, the a6b6 holoenzyme of propionyl- coenzyme A carboxylase, human symplekin-Ssu72-CTD phosphopeptide complex, histone mRNA stem-loop,human stem-loop binding protein and 3’hExo ternary complex, human phosphofructokinase-1, and the 500-kDa yeast acetyl-CoA carboxylase holoenzyme dimer using X-ray crystallography. In addition to structural studies, Liang also contributed to the understanding of the biological mechanisms and macro molecule interactions by combining a variety of biochemical and molecular biology approaches with structural analysis. In the study that characterized Cyclic Dinucleotide c-di-AMP as an allosteric regulator of metabolic enzyme function, chemical proteomics were used to define the c-di-AMP interactome of L. monocytogenes, enzyme kinetics study was used to show the inhibitory effect of c-di-AMP on LmPC, analysis of the structure of LmPC in complex with c-di-AMP further supported the interaction between LmPC and c-di-AMP, and experiments at the cellular level showed that metabolic balance mediated by c-di-AMP affected intracellular growth of L. monocytogenes by causing bacteriolysis within the host cytosol. Current research in the Liang Tong's lab focuses on enzymes involved in fatty acid metabolism, including Acetyl-CoA carboxylase, carnitine acyltransferase, AMP- activated protein kinase, and others. These enzymes are important targets for drug discovery against obesity, diabetes and other human diseases. The goal of his research is to produce structural information on these enzymes and to understand their functions at the molecular level. The structural information will also lay the foundation for drug discovery against these targets. Another area of his research is on proteins involved in pre-mRNA 3'-end processing. Most eukaryotic mRNA precursors must undergo cleavage and polyadenylation in their 3'-ends before they can function as mRNAs. This processing machinery contains more than 16 protein factors, which form several sub-complexes (CPSF, CSTF). The goal of his research is to understand the molecular basis of this important event.

It was initially published in the Wilson Library Bulletin, and has been influential in library professional standards relating to censorship and collection development. The full text of the article currently resides on the website of the American Library Association. Overview This seminal 1953 article on the difference between censorship and selection in libraries influenced later thought and formed the cornerstone of many intellectual freedom documents. Summary In the first section of the article Asheim goes over the difference of censorship of a book by the law or by a town, versus the choice of a librarian not to select something for her library. He states that the librarian is not censoring because she is making a choice that only affects her specific institution, whereas the choice the censors are making affect an entire town or nation. The librarian is not saying that the book cannot be circulated, only that she is not going to circulate it. Patrons are still able to get it elsewhere. Asheim then brings up the question of limited control. He wonders if limited control, which the librarian has when choosing not to select a book, is any different from the limited control of the local pressure group. He then concludes that it is different because the reasons and motives behind the choice are different. He also believes that the patron who is being denied the book is affected differently depending on the intent of the person who is choosing to limit the book. Asheim makes the analogy of the difference between someone’s leg being amputated by a doctor who is doing it because it is necessary, versus a leg being amputated by someone who is psychotic and is doing it because of a sick compulsion. The man who has had his leg amputated by the psychotic knows the difference and is affected differently than if a doctor had done it out of a need to help his patient. Because it is a physical impossibility to make all books equally accessible, selection by librarians is necessary. Asheim writes that some of the standards that librarians use for selecting books are the same standards that censors use to ban books. For example, it is valid to use the intent of the author as a selection standard, however it can also be used to ban a book in which it is decided that the author's intent is pornographic or treasonable. The standards are subjective. Therefore, the difference between selection and censorship is found in the way the standards are applied. Asheim argues that the main difference between a selector and a censor is in their approach: the selector's is positive, the censor's is negative. The selector, seeking to preserve, looks to find reasons to keep a book. The censor, seeking to ban, looks for reasons to reject a book. Asheim says that the negative approach makes it inevitable that a book will be judged not in its wholeness but by isolated parts. He writes that the selector's positive approach is demonstrated by the diversity of a library's collection that makes as much as possible accessible to patrons. Further, he believes that the frequency of challenges to library holdings is in itself a testament to the difference between selection and censorship. He writes that the censor uses external criteria to judge a book; for instance, the author's life may be examined and used as a way to reject a work. The selector, on the other hand, uses internal values and judges a book by its own merit. He calls selection democratic and censorship authoritarian. Finally, Asheim reminds that the confidence the public has in librarians is an earned confidence that can only be kept by staying true to the profession's ideals. And one of these ideals is maintaining the essential difference between selection and censorship. Influence Asheim's article has influenced many in the library profession and authors continue to cite it when responding to the changing censorship landscape. In 2002, Tony Doyle drew upon Asheim's article to talk about censorship in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks and June Pinnell- Stephens argued that Asheim's censorship/selection distinction is useful for understanding collection development and censorship in the digital age. It has been argued that the dichotomy of \\"censorship\\" and \\"selection\\" has the effect of othering the censor. In 2010, Rickey Best cited Asheim in an article portraying academic libraries as bastions of intellectual freedom for maintaining access to materials that were frequently challenged in public libraries. Reappraisal In 1983, Asheim wrote a reappraisal of his own article to address the changing tactics of censors and to challenge the persistent assumption that librarians select materials based primarily on their personal tastes. Asheim characterizes groups such as the Moral Majority as having recently (at the time of his writing) switched from attempting to have objectionable books removed to attempting to have books they approved of included to such an extent that the library's collection would be skewed to their perspective. In response, Asheim further emphasizes that segments of the library's patron base should not be allowed to impede each other's rights, and that the job of the librarian is to make selection choices with the library's entire community in mind. He also upholds his prior assertion that the best response to the problem of access is to add ideas rather than to remove them.
