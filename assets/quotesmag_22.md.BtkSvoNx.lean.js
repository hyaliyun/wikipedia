In the Roman Empire, a mansio (from the Latin word mansus, the perfect passive participle of manere \\"to remain\\" or \\"to stay\\") was an official stopping place on a Roman road, or via, maintained by the central government for the use of officials and those on official business whilst travelling. Background Plan of the fort Sz√°zhalombatta-Dunaf√ºred (Matrica, Hungary): Mansio. The roads which traversed the Ancient World were later surveyed, developed and carefully maintained by the Romans, featuring purpose-built rest stops at regular intervals, known as castra. Probably originally established as simple places of military encampment, in process of time they included barracks and magazines of provisions (horrea) for the troops. Over time the need arose for a more sophisticated form of shelter for travelling dignitaries and officials. The Latin term mansio is derived from manere, signifying to pass the night at a place while travelling. (The word is likely to be the source of the English word mansion, though their uses are entirely different). These substantial structures, normally in the form of a villa, were dedicated to the travellers' rest and refreshment. Guests were expected to provide a passport to identify themselves. In many cases infrastructure to sustain them sprang up around the mansio, but also the villas of provincial officials; forts and ultimately even cities. Ox-drawn carts could travel about 30 km per day; pedestrians a little farther, so each mansio was about 25 to 30 km from the next. At each mansio cisiarii kept gigs for hire and for conveying government dispatches (Cisium; Essedum). The Itinerarium Burdigalense, which is a road book drawn up in 333, mentions in order the mansiones from Bordeaux to Jerusalem with the intervening mutationes, and other, more considerable places, which are called either civitates, vici, or castella. The number of leagues (league) or of miles between one place and another is also set down. Mansionarius or paramonarius The mansio was under the superintendence of an officer called mansionarius. As the bishops assumed control in the Christian West during the fifth and sixth centuries, the office of mansionarius developed new connotations. Mansionarius is inserted as a synonym of prosmonarius/paramonarius in canon 2 of the Fourth Ecumenical Council (451).Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers Series II/Volume XIV/The Fourth Ecumenical Council/Canons/Canon II: \\"what was the function of a mansionarius? In Gregory the Great‚Äôs time he was a sacristan who had the duty of lighting the church (Dial., i. 5); and ‚Äúostiarium‚Äù in the Prisca implies the same idea. Tillemont, without deciding between the two Greek readings, thinks that the person intended had ‚Äúsome charge of what pertained to the church itself, perhaps like our present bedells‚Äù (xv. 694). So Fleury renders, ‚Äúconci√®rge‚Äù (xxviij. 29); and Newman, reading ‚Äúparamonarion,‚Äù takes a like view (note in Transl. of Fleury, vol. iii., p. 392). But Justellus (i. 91) derives ‚Äúparamonarius‚Äù from ŒºŒøŒΩŒÆ ‚Äúmansio,‚Äù a halting-place, so that the sense would be a manager of one of the church‚Äôs farms, a ‚Äúvillicus,‚Äù or, as Bingham expresses it, ‚Äúa bailiff‚Äù (iii. 3, 1). Beveridge agrees with Justellus, except in giving to ŒºŒøŒΩŒÆ the sense of ‚Äúmonastery‚Äù (compare the use of ŒºŒøŒΩŒÆ in Athanas., Apol. c. Arian, 67, where Valesius understands it as ‚Äúa station‚Äù on a road, but others as ‚Äúa monastery,‚Äù see Historical Writings of St. Athanasius, Introd., p. xliv.). Bingham also prefers this interpretation. Suicer takes it as required by ‚Äúparamonarios‚Äù which he treats as the true reading: ‚Äúprosmonarios‚Äù he thinks would have the sense of ‚Äúsacristan.‚Äù\\" Examples Britannia *Alfoldean, Horsham, Sussex (subject of a dig by archaeological television programme Time Team, 2006 series) *Chelmsford *Cunetio, Mildenhall, Wiltshire.

Cauponae A private system of cauponae were placed near the mansiones. They performed the same functions but were somewhat disreputable, as they were frequented by thieves and prostitutes. Graffiti decorate the walls of the few whose ruins have been found. Tabernae Genteel travellers needed something better than cauponae. In the early days of the viae, when little unofficial travel existed, houses placed near the road were required by law to offer hospitality on demand. Frequented houses no doubt became the first tabernae (Latin word taberna (\\"shed\\" or \\"hut\\"; from tabula, meaning \\"board\\"), which were hostels, rather than the \\"taverns\\" we know today. A tabernaculum or small taberna was a portable place of worship for the Hebrews, thus producing the word tabernacle. As Rome grew, so did its tabernae, becoming more luxurious and acquiring good or bad reputations as the case may be. One of the best hotels was the Tabernae Caediciae at Sinuessa on the Via Appia. It had a large storage room containing barrels of wine, cheese and ham. Many cities of today grew up around a taberna complex, such as Rheinzabern in the Rhineland, and Saverne in Alsace. Mutationes A third system of way stations serviced vehicles and animals: the mutationes (\\"changing stations\\") (). In these complexes, the driver could purchase the services of wheelwrights, cartwrights, and equarii medici, or veterinarians. Using these stations in chariot relays, the emperor Tiberius hastened 200 miles in 24 hours to join his brother, Drusus Germanicus,Naturalis Historia by Gaius Plinius Secundus, Liber VII, 84.The General History of the Highways by Nicolas Bergier, page 156. who was dying of gangrene as a result of a fall from a horse.

The ore fields were discovered as early as in the 1650s, but due to their remote location in the sparsely populated areas in northern Sweden, far from both the Atlantic coast and the coast of the Bothnian Gulf, it was very hard to transport the ore to any port from where it could be shipped to its ultimate destination. All attempts during the centuries to efficiently transport the ore failed. But with the introduction of the railway, new possibilities arose. Some earlier plans included horse- drawn trains and regular roads, but in the end it was decided to combine the new railway technology with the ancient boat transport. A railway line was planned for the stretch from the iron ore fields to the place where Stora Lule River and Lilla Lule River joined at Storbacken. The remaining length of the transport could be made possible by canalising the rest of Lule River from Storbacken down to Lule√•. This would bypass the rapids of Edefors and Hedenforsarna which would allow the ore to be transported by boat all the way to the Gulf of Bothnia. The decision to construct the canal was taken 1863, and the Gellivare Company Limited based in London was contracted for the project. They were backed by English financiers and also received investments from the Swedish state. The excavation was started 14 October 1864 and by 1865 no less than 1,486 men were working on the project. But the English company soon experienced an economic crisis, which led to the stagnation of the construction in 1866 and 1867, until the company went bankrupt on New Year's Eve 1867 which marked the end of the project. In 1884-1888 a railway was built all the way between G√§llivare and Lule√•, the Iron Ore Line. Remains of the canal project can still be seen on several places in Norrbotten and Swedish Lapland, for example in Boden. These remains are sometimes called Engelska graven, which is a play on the Swedish word grav which can mean both \\"ditch\\"/\\"trench\\" and \\"grave/\\"tomb\\".

Although the Rydberg formula was developed to describe atomic energy levels, it has been used to describe many other systems that have electronic structure roughly similar to atomic hydrogen. In general, at sufficiently high principal quantum numbers, an excited electron - ionic core system will have the general character of a hydrogenic system and the energy levels will follow the Rydberg formula. Rydberg states have energies converging on the energy of the ion. The ionization energy threshold is the energy required to completely liberate an electron from the ionic core of an atom or molecule. In practice, a Rydberg wave packet is created by a laser pulse on a hydrogenic atom and thus populates a superposition of Rydberg states. Modern investigations using pump- probe experiments show molecular pathways ‚Äì e.g. dissociation of (NO)2 ‚Äì via these special states. Rydberg series Rydberg series describe the energy levels associated with partially removing an electron from the ionic core. Each Rydberg series converges on an ionization energy threshold associated with a particular ionic core configuration. These quantized Rydberg energy levels can be associated with the quasiclassical Bohr atomic picture. The closer you get to the ionization threshold energy, the higher the principal quantum number, and the smaller the energy difference between \\"near threshold Rydberg states.\\" As the electron is promoted to higher energy levels, the spatial excursion of the electron from the ionic core increases and the system is more like the Bohr quasiclassical picture. Energy of Rydberg states The energy of Rydberg states can be refined by including a correction called the quantum defect in the Rydberg formula. The \\"quantum defect\\" correction is associated with the presence of a distributed ionic core. Even for many electronically excited molecular systems, the ionic core interaction with an excited electron can take on the general aspects of the interaction between the proton and the electron in the hydrogen atom. The spectroscopic assignment of these states follows the Rydberg formula and they are called Rydberg states of molecules. Molecular Rydberg states Although the energy formula of Rydberg series is a result of hydrogen-like atom structure, Rydberg states are also present in molecules. Wave functions of high Rydberg states are very diffused and span diameters that approach infinity. As a result, any isolated neutral molecule behaves like hydrogen-like atoms at the Rydberg limit. For molecules with multiple stable monovalent cations, multiple Rydberg series may exist. Because of the complexity of molecular spectra, low-lying Rydberg states of molecules are often mixed with valence states with similar energy and are thus not pure Rydberg states.Stohr, J., \\"NEXAFS Spectroscopy\\" Springer Series in Surface Science 25, (1992), p. 86.

It is based on the novel of the same name (originally published in the USA under the name North to Freedom) by Anne Holm. The film was produced by Walden Media and Lions Gate Entertainment. Plot Seven years after World War II, a 12-year-old boy named David (Ben Tibber) escapes a Gulag in Bulgaria where he has spent his entire life where his mother has been taken away from him. He sets out on a risky journey to Denmark, initially believing he is on an important mission to deliver a letter, but eventually discovering that the \\"mission\\" was to reunite him with his mother, of whom he has distinct memories. Along his journey, he faces danger, fear, loneliness, hunger, missions and encounters various people. Johannes (Jim Caviezel), his friend and mentor in the camp, who prepares him for escape, is killed by a guard, leaving David to face escape on his own. David is helped by a guard to escape, who gives him a compass and tells him he must go southwest to Greece, take a boat to Italy and finally go north to Denmark, a peaceful and neutral country. The guard also tells him to trust no one. Since David was locked in a camp all his life, he has repressed feelings and trusts no one anyway, and so feels lost and disoriented in the world. Along his journey, though he is mistreated by some people, he is well-treated by others. Gradually he learns that some people can be trusted, and to open up and experience his own feelings. Finally, with the help of decent people whom he has learned to trust, David is reunited with his mother in Denmark.

While the name 'Oakwell' generally refers to the main stadium, it also includes several neighbouring venues which form the facilities of the Barnsley F.C Academy, an indoor training pitch, a smaller stadium with seating on the south and west sides for around 2,200 spectators, and several training pitches used by the different Barnsley FC squads. Oakwell was the first stadium in English football to have a designated stand for disabled supporters. Until 2003 the stadium and the vast amount of land that surrounds it were owned by Barnsley Football Club themselves; however, after the club fell into administration in 2002, the council purchased the main Oakwell Stadium to allow the club to pay its creditors and remain participants in the Football League. West Stand The stand is made up of two tiers, with only the upper tier covered, but at the expense of several supporting columns for the roof structure. The seats are the originals from the early 1900s, and from here you get a decent view with moderate legroom. In spite of the restricted views and modest facilities, the West Stand remains a popular vantage point for many fans. The lower tier of the West Stand is uncovered and offers a great view of the action. The roof of the West Stand is corrugated iron. This also houses the main television gantry, which is accessed from the upper tier seating area by a temporary ladder. At the end of the 1990s, the then stadium owners Barnsley Football Club were considering re-developing the West Stand after several seasons of high attendances; however, with the rapid decline in fortunes of the football club, subsequent sale of the stadium and new club ownership, these plans are unlikely to come to fruition in the near future. The stand also incorporates a traditional players' tunnel in the center. While this is used for access to some of the facilities underneath the stand, the main players' tunnel now feeds out from the north-west corner, following the relocation of the changing rooms to the North Stand. The West Stand has a total seating capacity of 4,752. East Stand The East Stand The East Stand is a two-tier development, completed in 1993. Funded in part by the football trust, the stand has a capacity of 7,492 and replaced a large covered terrace known as the Brewery Stand. The East Stand was designed by NYP Architects, as was the North Stand and the Corner Stand. With the completion of the East Stand, Barnsley FC became the first football club in Yorkshire to incorporate 'executive boxes' into their stadium. Because of the sloped land on which Oakwell Stadium is built, the rear of the East Stand is much taller than it is from the pitch side, meaning that a climb to the upper-tier seating area requires many more steps than a spectator may anticipate; however, several lifts are available. CK Beckett Stand The CK Beckett Stand Built in 1995, CK Beckett is the current name for what is traditionally known as the 'Pontefract Road End' or 'Ponty End'. Some fans continue to call it the 'ORA Stand', in reference to its original sponsors. It is also known as the Van Damme Stand. With a capacity of 4,508, the CK Beckett Stand is a large covered single-tier seating area behind the goal on the south side of the stadium. This part of the stadium also houses the club superstore, the box office, and general administration offices. North Stand The North Stand The North Stand is the most recent addition to Oakwell Stadium and is a large covered singled-tiered seating area with a capacity of 6,257 spectators. As this stand is generally reserved for away supporters, its full capacity is rarely utilized. At a cost of ¬£4.5 million (including several academy facilities that it accommodates), it has been a cause for debate ever since its construction. However, at the time it was built, Barnsley had only just been relegated from the FA Premier League and were planning for a possible return. Wakefield Audi Corner Stand The Corner Stand Built in the summer of 1998 and originally known as 'The Welcome Windows Stand', the structure provides further executive areas and disabled facilities for viewing an event. Access to this area was also incorporated into the neighbouring East Stand on several levels; the spectator capacity of the structure is 202. In August 2015 Barnsley announced the new sponsor of the stand, renaming it to the Brittania Drilling Limited Stand. However, on 9 October 2018, the sponsor changed yet again, to Wakefield Audi.https://www.barnsleyfc.co.uk/news/2018/october/audipartners/ Other uses In recent years Oakwell Stadium has rarely been used by anyone other than Barnsley FC, apart from the occasional 'celebrity' charity football match. Wakefield Trinity Wildcats rugby league club used the stadium for their first game in the Super League in 1998. Non-league football club Wakefield and Emley used the stadium for an FA Cup tie against Rotherham in 1998, choosing a larger neutral venue as opposed to the traditional option of 'switching' the tie to the home of the team which was drawn away. Premier League side Manchester City used the stadium for their first qualifying round UEFA Cup game in July 2008, since the pitch at the City Of Manchester Stadium was unsuitable for football after the summer's commercial activities, such as boxing and music concerts, and was being re-turfed. Tragedy On 27 December 1920, Horace Fairhurst, a full-back for the visiting Blackpool, received a blow to the head during the league encounter. He died at home eleven days later as a result of the injury.Calley, Roy (1992).

Plot Baxter, a bull terrier, is taken from the pens and given to an old woman. Baxter hates the old woman's bland lifestyle and reacts to her habits with disgust. In contrast, he becomes obsessed with the young couple across the street as he observes their nightly lovemaking sessions. Baxter attempts to communicate his dominance over the old woman by causing her to stumble, but his plan backfires. The old woman's condition deteriorates, and ultimately Baxter kills her in order to be adopted by the young couple. Baxter enjoys his life with the young couple, splitting his time between the sensual woman and the earthy man. He brings them dead animals in an attempt to show them who he is. His idyll is broken when the couple has a baby and begins to neglect him. Baxter hates the weak and helpless child. He attempts to kill it, but his plans again backfire. Ignorant of Baxter's murderous intentions, the couple gives Baxter to a neighborhood boy. Baxter thrills under the firm hand of his new master, a budding sociopath and Hitler fanatic. The boy begins to see a girl from his school who reminds him of Eva Braun. Baxter impregnates the girl's spaniel, though his own sexuality disgusts him. Later Baxter kills a stray dog to show the boy who he is, and Baxter believes that they come to a mutual understanding. When the boy commands Baxter to kill a classmate, Baxter refuses and realizes that the boy does not understand him after all. The girl's spaniel gives birth to puppies, and Baxter reacts to them with mixed emotions. In an attempt to emulate the final days of Hitler, the boy kills the puppies. In reaction, Baxter decides that the boy must die. The boy attacks first, but Baxter manages to gain the upper hand. When the boy commands him to heel, Baxter finds that he cannot disobey, allowing the boy to kill him. Later, the boy breaks into the old lady's abandoned house and observes the young couple across the street. In a monologue echoing Baxter's, the boy plans to kill his parents and be adopted by the couple.

It is the home ground of Tranmere Rovers, as well as Liverpool's women and reserves teams. The ground has had several rebuilds, with the most recent occurring in 1995 in response to the requirement of the Taylor Report to become all-seater. Today's stadium holds 15,573 in four stands: the Kop, the Johnny King Stand, the Main Stand and the Cowshed (for away supporters). Attendances at the ground have fluctuated over its hundred-year history. Its largest-ever crowd was 24,424 for a 1972 FA Cup match between Tranmere and Stoke City. In 2010, an average of 5,000 fans attended each home game.  History  The ground in 1986 Tranmere Rovers F.C. were formed in 1884; they played their first matches at Steeles Field in Birkenhead but, in 1887, they bought a new site from Tranmere Rugby Club. The ground was variously referred to as the \\"Borough Road Enclosure\\", \\"Ravenshaw's Field\\" and \\"South Road\\". The name \\"Prenton Park\\" was adopted in 1895 as a result of a suggestion in the letters page of the Football Echo. Not strictly within Prenton, it is likely that the name was chosen as the area was regarded as more upmarket than nearby Tranmere. Because the land was required for housing and a school, Tranmere were forced to move and the name went with them. The present Prenton Park was opened by the Mayor of Birkenhead, Councillor George Proudman, on 9 March 1912. Their first match was played against Lancaster Town in the Lancashire Combination. There were stands (also known as bleachers) on both sides of the pitch, a paddock and three open terraces, the general format which remained until 1994. Floodlights were installed in the ground in September 1958. The supporters' association raised the ¬£15,000 cost of the new lights. When manager Dave Russell joined the club in 1961, one of his many influential changes was to take advantage of the lights, playing regular home games on Friday nights rather than the usual Saturday afternoon. This allowed supporters to watch Tranmere on Fridays and First Division sides Everton or Liverpool on Saturdays. The idea was successful and continued until the 1990s. Over the years, various upgrades and repairs have been made to the stadium. By 1968, the old wooden Main Stand was in poor condition and in need of replacement. At a cost of ¬£80,000, today's Main Stand was erected and opened by Minister for Sport and former referee Denis Howell. In 1979, the terracing on the Cowshed and Paddock was concreted. The Tranmere suite was added to the Main Stand in 1988, with further bars and executive suites added soon after. Many improvements to the ground were driven by changes in legislation. In 1985, the Safety of Sports Grounds Act led to a reduction in capacity from 18,000 to 8,000. The Kop End was closed, and the Main Stand capacity was reduced by 3,000, because there were insufficient access points. ¬£50,000 was spent on safety work to maintain a capacity of 8,000, and the club were unable to afford any further refurbishment. But the biggest change of all took place during 1994 and 1995. The Taylor Report suggested that all stadia in the top two divisions of English football should no longer permit standing. The club's response was to redevelop three sides of the ground with entirely new all-seater stands created ‚Äì the Borough Road Stand, the Cowshed and the new Kop. Capacity in the ground thus increased from 14,200 to the 16,587 of today.\\"Prenton Park - Tranmere Rovers\\". Football Ground Guide. Retrieved 7 April 2017. In 2009, Liverpool F.C. Reserves moved from the Racecourse Ground to Prenton Park. In 2018, Liverpool F.C. Women moved here as well.  Stands  A plan of the stadium's layout An outside view of the Main Stand in 2015 The Main Stand in 2015 viewed from The Cowshed Stand  Main Stand  The Main Stand is the oldest in Prenton Park, having been opened in December 1968. It is also the largest, with a capacity of 5,957. A two tier stand, it is generally divided into three main sections. The lower tier consists of the Bebington End paddock (capacity 1,150) and the Town End paddock (capacity 1,209), either side of the halfway line. The upper tier is simply referred to as the Main Stand (capacity 3,598). The Main Stand houses the VIP area, directors box and various suites. The Tranmere suite was added to the Main Stand in 1988, with the Dixie Dean suite, Bunny Bell bar and Dave Russell restaurant added soon after. The 40-year-old structure is becoming increasingly expensive to repair.  Kop  The Bebington Kop, simply referred to as the Kop, is a large single-tier, all-seater stand with a capacity of 5,696. Completed in 1995, it replaced the earlier open terrace (also called the Kop) which had stood behind the goal at the Bebington End. Originally the Kop housed both home and away fans, split down the middle, and occasionally was handed entirely to the away fans. However, following the 2000 League Cup semi-final against Bolton, when the Kop was given entirely to the home fans, a campaign was begun to claim the Kop as a home end. From the 2000-01 season this became the case, with away fans housed in the Cowshed.  Johnny King Stand  Built in 1995 and formerly known as the Borough Road Stand, it was renamed in 2002 to recognise former Rovers manager John King. The stand runs along the Borough Road side of the pitch, and is a low-rise seated stand with a capacity of 2,414.  Cowshed  The Cowshed houses away fans at Prenton Park, and has a capacity of 2,500. It has a slanted seating arrangement, caused by the main road running behind it. It historically housed the more vocal home fans, but was switched to away supporters around the start of the 21st century. Since the change, a bar and TV screens have been added to the stand. The name is derived from its appearance before the redevelopment in 1995. With a 3 peak roof of corrugated iron, walls of wooden plank and a cinder bank floor it visually resembled an agricultural building.  Attendances  Prenton Park has seen the number of supporters rise and fall considerably over its hundred-year history. Around 8,000 visitors watched the first game at the stadium on 11 March 1912, as Tranmere beat Lancaster Town 8‚Äì0. Early attendances varied from 5,000 to 8,000, though, on Boxing Day 1921, 11,137 supporters came to see Tranmere take on Bolton Wanderers Reserves. Tranmere entered The Football League the next season, and 7,011 watched their first game against Crewe Alexandra F.C.. There was an average of 6,000 in attendance at home games, before the Football League was suspended as a result of the Second World War. After the war, the number of supporters rose, and by the early 1960s this number had increased to highs of 12,000. Attendances began to fall towards the end of the 1960s; this trend continued through the 1970s, though the decade did give Tranmere its largest-ever crowd: 24,424 on 5 February 1972, for a fourth-round FA Cup match against Stoke City. With today's capacity of under 17,000, it is unlikely that this record attendance will ever be broken. The 1980s saw the number of supporters falling to some of the ground's lowest levels. The lowest ever attendance at Prenton Park was on 20 February 1984, when only 937 supporters watched a 2‚Äì0 victory over Halifax Town. However, the decade also saw a high number of supporters in the ground for other reasons. In the Hillsborough disaster, 96 Liverpool F.C. fans lost their lives and, on 15 April 1989, 12,000 people attended a memorial service at Prenton Park. Tranmere's success in the 1990s led to improved attendances, rising to around 9,000 per game. By 2010, this had fallen to around 5,000 per game; however, 12,249 supporters took advantage of an offer of free admission to watch a replayed match against Notts County F.C., on 19 April 2011. In the season 2011‚Äì2012, there were two ¬£5 administration offers available; one of them was on a Bank Holiday and the other was for a celebration of 100 years of Prenton Park 1912‚Äì2012 with an attendance of 6,824, with many events on before and after the game and at half time.  Record games   Tranmere v Oldham, 1935  On Boxing Day 1935, Tranmere faced Oldham Athletic at Prenton Park in the Third Division North. Oldham had beaten Tranmere 4‚Äì1 the previous day, but Tranmere won 13‚Äì4 in the return fixture, including nine goals by Bunny Bell. At the time Bell's feat was an individual record, but it stood for only four months before Joe Payne netted ten for Luton Town, on his debut against Bristol Rovers. However, the aggregate of 17 goals in one game remains a league record.  Women's FA Cup finals  The only major finals to take place at Prenton Park were the Women's FA Cup in 1991 and 1992. The 1991 final was contested by Millwall Lionesses and Doncaster Belles. Millwall won the game 1‚Äì0 in front of a crowd of 4,000. The game was broadcast live on Channel 4. In 1992, Doncaster Belles returned to beat Red Star Southampton 4‚Äì0.  Shelbourne v Rangers, 1998  The only UEFA European Fixture to take place at Prenton Park was a UEFA Cup first qualifying round tie between Irish team Shelbourne and Scottish team Rangers, on 22 July 1998. Due to fears of sectarian violence, and after discussions between the two clubs and UEFA, Prenton Park was chosen as the venue for the first leg, with Shelbourne as the home team. The match finished 3‚Äì5 in favour of Rangers after Shelbourne (at the time a semi-professional side) had earlier taken a 3‚Äì0 lead. As a result of this game, Rangers were fined 25,000 Swiss Francs and warned by UEFA for their fans' behaviour at the game. Transport systems The nearest railway station to the ground is Rock Ferry on Merseyrail's Wirral Line, 1.2 miles away. The ground is also served by the 38B, 603, 627 and 659 bus routes.

This pademelon has developed heavier and bushier fur than its northern relatives, who inhabit northern Australia and Papua New Guinea. Males reach around 7 kg (15.4 lbs) in weight, 1‚Äì1.2 metres in length including the tail, and are considerably larger than the females, which average 4 kg (8.8 lbs). Habitat joey. Skull of a Tasmanian pandemelon Pademelons are solitary and nocturnal, spending the daylight hours in thick vegetation. Rainforest, sclerophyll forest, and scrubland are preferred, although wet gullies in dry open eucalyptus forest are also used. Such places, next to open areas where feeding can occur, are especially favoured. After dusk, the animals move onto open areas to feed, but rarely stray more than 100 metres from the forest edge. The species is abundant and widespread throughout Tasmania. Diet The Tasmanian pademelon is a nocturnal herbivore feeding on a wide variety of plants, from herbs, green shoots and grass, to some nectar-bearing flowers. Once a part of the diet of the thylacine, the Tasmanian pademelon is still preyed upon by other predators of the island, including the Tasmanian devil and quolls. Even so, they are abundant to the point of being culled occasionally (along with other wallabies) to reduce competition for grass with the farmed animals. Hunting of the Tasmanian pademelon is allowed, its pelt having some economic value and its meat being palatable. Breeding There is no specific breeding season, though 70% of pademelon births seem to occur around the beginning of winter. Gestation for the female is 30 days. The young are in the pouch for about 6 months thereafter, and are weaned at around 8 months. Joeys are sexually mature at 14‚Äì15 months.

It is located approximately inland of Whitley Bay and approximately north of The Tyne Tunnel. A mile or so north of Shiremoor, the extensive built-up areas of North Tyneside change abruptly into green belt stretching north into south east Northumberland. It has a population of 4,782.Office for National Statistics: Census 2001 : Urban Areas: Table KS01 : Usual Resident Population Retrieved 26 August 2009 Shiremoor is not historically a centre of population but many housing estates were built there in the 20th and 21st centuries. Shiremoor was first built as a colliery village to accommodate the miners of the local pits. Shiremoor comprises numerous estates. They include the oldest two estates of Bertram Grange and Old Shiremoor. As well as Park Estate, Leeches Estate, and Shiremoor. In the early 2000s a new area was built, known as Northumberland Park. Although built as a separate village, estate agents refer to it as being a part of Shiremoor. Earsdon View is the newest estate to be built to the north of Shiremoor. History The original name, Tynemouthshire Moor, refers to the common of the manor of Tynemouth. The area grew as a result of the coal industry, developed to house miners from the local pits. As the coal industry in the area declined, Shiremoor became a commuter area and more recently serves as a commercial centre. Shiremoor colliery was linked to the North Eastern Railway by the Blyth and Tyne Railway. The old railway route is now a walking route known as The Wagon Way. Shiremoor & District Children's Treat Every year the local people hold a \\"treat\\" for the children of Shiremoor and surrounding villages. This tradition dates back to 1907 and has been held every year since. It was started by a group of men from the local pit and today is run by a committee of local people. The \\"treat field\\" was originally located along Algenon Drive. However, due to new developments being built it was relocated in the early 21st century to Earsdon road, near the Grey Horse pub. The Treat itself comprises many events that the local schools take part in. There is an art competition, a dance display, many sports competitions, including football, netball and hockey. There is always a tea tent ran by the locals. Today there is a fun fair held alongside the Treat. Each year the children of the local schools receive a free \\"Treat Ticket\\". The ticket gets them an ice cream and a souvenir. The local schools meet outside their school and \\"march\\" to the treat. This is usually led by a band, and the school banner. Many local people join in the march as it is seen as very much a local tradition. The Shiremoor Treat was cancelled in 2020 for the first time in its history due to the global COVID-19 pandemic. Education There is a Primary School located in Shiremoor, described by Ofsted as an outstanding school. It provides for children aged up to age 11, including nurseries for 2+.

It is called Moorbridge and was opened in 2010. It caters for KS3 and KS4 children with Behavioural, Emotional and Social difficulties with up to 60 places. Most of Shiremoor falls into the catchment area of George Stephenson High School, in Killingworth. However, the most southern estate, opposite Boundary Mills, is actual in the catchment area for John Spence Community High School, in North Shields. To the east of Shiremoor, in the Whitley Bay area, the schools still runs on the three tier system and therefore, Shiremoor also fall into different catchment areas for both Middle and High schools. Health Care There is a Resource Centre on Earsdon Road which comprises two Doctors Surgeries, Pharmacy and a Library. The doctors houses 2 practises.

The stadium is the home ground of the League Two football club Southend United. With a capacity of 12,392http://www.footballgroundguide.com/southend_united/ Roots Hall is the largest football stadium in Essex, and is the current venue for the final of the Essex Senior Cup. Plans are in place for a new 22,000 seat stadium at Fossetts Farm, though work has yet to begin on the new development.  History   Pre-Roots Hall (1900s‚Äì1940s)  The site now occupied by Roots Hall is where Southend United had originally played their home games on their formation in 1906. Upon the outbreak of the First World War the area was designated for storage and Southend were forced out. After the war the club elected to move to a new ground at the Kursaal and Roots Hall first became a quarry for sand then a tipping site.  Relocation to Roots Hall (1950s)  By the early 1950s Southend had moved to Southend Stadium off Sutton Road. The club did not own the ground and the dog track which encircled the pitch made it unsuitable for use as a football stadium. In 1952 the wasteland at the old Roots Hall site was purchased to build a new stadium for the club. Work on the ground could not begin immediately owing to the large quantities of rubbish which had been dumped on the site in the club's absence, which took nearly a year to clear. On 20 August 1955 Roots Hall hosted its first match, against Norwich City. The ground was declared open by the Secretary of the Football Association, Sir Stanley Rous. The ground remained the youngest in the Football League until the opening of Scunthorpe United's Glanford Park in 1988. Roots Hall's construction had not been completed when the ground was opened, with some stands only running for a short distance along the touchline and others waiting to be concreted over. In addition to these problems, the pitch's drainage was unsuitable and by the end of the 1955‚Äì56 season it had to be completely relaid.  Ground development (1960s)  With the pitch issue dealt with, Southend could concentrate on the matter at hand: completing the ground. The west bank roof, originally set back from the pitch, was extended forwards to the touchline creating a double-barrel effect, while work also commenced on finishing the terracing. The job was finally finished in 1964, after all 72 steps of the giant south bank had been concreted. The east stand was extended in both directions so it ran the full length of the touchline in 1966, and around the same time the club installed floodlighting. Finally the ground was finished, and had its finest day in 1979, when a ground record 31,033 fans packed the Hall to watch Liverpool in action in the FA Cup.  Recent work (1980s‚Äìpresent)  By the mid-1980s, however, the club were struggling financially. In an effort to keep the club afloat, most of the south bank was sold off in 1988, and eventually the remainder was replaced in 1994 by a small two tiered all-seater stand, designed by then club chairman Vic Jobson. All this came after the west and east stands saw work in 1992, when the west bank was turned into an all-seated stand and the paddocks in the east had seating attached. The final stage of development at the Hall came in 1995, when the west stand roof was extended at either end to meet the south and north stands, with seating being installed in the north-west corner of the ground. Development since has been mainly concentrated on the ground's facilities, in recent years the club opened a new ticket office and club shop, replaced the old style turnstiles with modern electronic ones and extended executive accommodation at the rear of the east stand. A new digital scoreboard was also added to the north stand roof in November 2012.  Relocation to Fossetts Farm  In the 1990s Southend United started planning to leave Roots Hall for a proposed new ground at Fossetts Farm. In January 2007, the club received planning permission from both Southend and Rochford councils for the stadium, retail outlets, a hotel and new training facilities but this was subject to rubber-stamping from the Secretary of State. The Department for Communities and Local Government gave broad approval to the plans in March 2008 and planning permission was granted later the same month for the HOK-designed new stadium. Roots Hall has been sold to Sainsbury's, which has received planning permission to build a new supermarket on the site. Building work on Fossetts Farm was due to start in 2014, however due to issues with the supermarket development, as Sainsbury's had yet to complete the purchase of the former Prospects College site, which was required for access to the new store, work failed to commence. However, on 28 April 2017 new plans were submitted for the work which no longer involved Sainsbury's. The move to the new stadium was scheduled for December 2018.  Structure   Fairfield BMW East Stand  The east stand is the main stand at Roots Hall, running along one side of the pitch. Originally designed as a section of seating with paddocks of terracing below, it was converted to an all seater stand in the 1990s. The stand also contains executive boxes and, in the back, the club offices. The dugouts are cut into the stand, covered by the main roof. The stand was originally much smaller and evidence of its extension along the touchline can be seen in the density of moss on the roof. According to the club website this stand contains 2,878 seats, but recently a small block of seats on the far right side was removed to house training goals.  Hi-Tec South Stand  Originally a 72-step terrace, financial troubles in the mid-1990s saw the old terrace reduced dramatically before being replaced by a significantly smaller two-tier stand. The bottom tier forms part of the family enclosure, alongside part of the west stand. According to the club website this stand contains 2,029 seats.  Paul Robinson West Stand  The west was also formerly a terrace, though it was converted into a stand by bolting seats (purchased second hand from Manchester City F.C.) onto the existing structure, reducing the total capacity to 3,337. Originally the terrace only ran the length of the touch-line but when the ground was improved in the 1990s the north-west corner was filled-in. This section is sometimes used for away supporters, depending on demand. The roof has a unique double-barrelled construction; originally the stand's cover was set back from the pitch, and when the club constructed cover for the front section of the old terrace they built another identical span. A small section of the west stand has been designated as the family stand, and Block W (at the north end of the stand) houses \\"The Blue Voice\\" singing section which provides game atmosphere.  ADSI North Stand  The north stand, also known as the north bank, is another converted terrace. The roof has a semi-circular 'barrel' shape, similar to the west stand's original roof, with a scoreboard in the centre. Part of the north stand is designated for up to 1,200 away supporters, but if necessary the whole stand can be allocated to bring the allocation up to around 2,000 which has been achieved at large matches such as those against Manchester United F.C. and Chelsea F.C. During 2010‚Äì2013, whenever there were small away crowds, Blues fans were allowed into the north stand.  References  Category:Football venues in Essex Category:Southend United F.C.

He was the brother of Hugh de Wells, who became Bishop of Lincoln. Jocelin became a canon of Wells Cathedral before 1200, and was elected bishop in 1206. During King John of England's dispute with Pope Innocent III, Jocelin at first remained with the king, but after the excommunication of John in late 1209, Jocelin went into exile. He returned to England in 1213, and was mentioned in Magna Carta in 1215. Jocelin was one of the bishops that crowned John's son Henry III, and throughout the rest of Jocelin's life was involved in royal administration. He was also active in his diocese, ordering construction on the cathedral at Wells, and issuing rules for his diocesan clergy. During his time as bishop, he settled a dispute between his diocese and Glastonbury Abbey that had started during the bishopric of his predecessor. The memorial brass on his tomb in Wells Cathedral is probably one of the earliest in England. Early life Jocelin born in Wells in Somerset,Greenway Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066‚Äì1300: Volume 7: Bath and Wells: Unidentified Prebendaries and was the son of Edward of Wells, a small landowner in the city of Wells.Gibbs and Lang Bishops and Reform p. 186 His brother Hugh de Wells, was archdeacon of Wells and Bishop of Lincoln.Greenway Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066‚Äì1300: Volume 7: Bath and Wells: Bishops Some historians say that another relative, although the exact relationship is unknown, was Simon of Wells, who became Bishop of Chichester in 1207,Turner King John p. 46 but other historians dispute this.Mayr-Harting \\"Wells, Simon of\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography The name Jocelin Trotman or Thotman, by which he was occasionally known by some modern historians, only dates from the Margam Annals, and is not contemporary with his life.Robinson \\"Bishop Jocelin and the Interdict: Appendix D\\" Somerset Historical Essays pp. 156‚Äì159 Jocelin was a royal justiciar in 1203, as well as the custodian of the vacant diocese of Lincoln. He was a royal clerk as well as a canon of Wells, becoming a canon and a deacon by 1200. The previous bishop of Wells died in 1205, and on 3 February 1206, Jocelin was elected bishop. He was consecrated on 28 May 1206,Fryde, et al. Handbook of British Chronology p. 228 at Reading by Bishop William of Sainte-M√®re-Eglise of London. It is unclear if the cathedral chapters of Bath and of Wells took the action on their own, or if King John was the driving force behind the election. Advisor to King John left Jocelin was one of the main advisors of King John during the dispute with the pope over Stephen Langton's appointment to the Archbishopric of Canterbury.Turner King John pp. 120‚Äì121 Jocelin did not immediately leave England after Pope Innocent III placed an interdict on England. Jocelin encouraged John to settle with Innocent in early 1209, worried that Innocent would expand the interdict into an excommunication, forcing John's advisors to choose between serving the king or obeying the pope. Nothing came of the negotiations, however. Jocelin did leave England when John was excommunicated in late 1209. Jocelin, along with Gilbert Glanvill, the Bishop of Rochester, was the subject of a mocking song on his conduct during the interdict.Poole Domesday Book to Magna Carta p. 446 and footnote 2 Jocelin and Hugh were in exile together in Bordeaux in 1212, but they both returned to England in May 1213, along with the other English bishops. Jocelin was one of the bishops in August 1214 who refused to pay a scutage to the king.Vincent Peter des Roches p. 99 In 1215, Jocelin sided with Stephen Langton and the barons, and Magna Charta lists Jocelin as one of the king's councillors.Powell and Wallis House of Lords p. 129 Henry III's reign Jocelin and Peter des Roches, the Bishop of Winchester, anointed and crowned King Henry III, the young son of John, after John's death. Later, Jocelin was present at the battle with Eustace the Monk in 1217, which helped to secure Henry's rule. Jocelin supported Hubert de Burgh's work of ejecting French forces from England and regaining control of royal castles seized by Falkes de Breaut√© and other barons. In 1218, Jocelin was one of the itinerant justiciars for southwestern England.Dunning \\"Wells, Jocelin of\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography In 1218 and 1219, Jocelin also ended the dispute between his diocese and Glastonbury Abbey. Jocelin gave up any claim to control of the abbey, and the abbey gave the bishopric a number of estates. Previously, the bishops, as part of their attempt to annexe Glastonbury to their bishopric, had been known as the Bishop of Bath and Glastonbury.Knowles Monastic Order in England p. 329‚Äì330 They also had held the office of abbot. In 1218, as part of the settlement, a new abbot was elected at Glastonbury.Knowles, et al. Heads of Religious Houses p. 52 The papacy had never acknowledged Jocelin's claiming of the title of abbot.Knowles, et al. Heads of Religious Houses p. 250 The historian J. A. Robinson felt that as part of the settlement, Jocelin began to use the title Bishop of Bath and Wells, but another historian, David Knowles, disagreed.Sayers \\"Monastic Archdeacons\\" Church and Government p. 184 and footnote 31 After 1223, Jocelin was a baron of the exchequer.Vincent Peter des Roches p. 267 In 1225 he served the king as head of one of the receivers of the tax of a fifteenth. After the dismissal of Walter Mauclerk as treasurer, at first Jocelin, along with Richard Poore, the Bishop of Durham, took over many of the treasurer's functions, but this did not last long, and after 1233, Jocelin no longer was involved with financial affairs. He occasionally witnessed charters, however.Vincent Peter des Roches p. 366 After the fall of Peter des Roches in April 1234, Jocelin was given control of the Wardrobe.Vincent Peter des Roches pp. 435‚Äì436 After this, he appears less regularly in royal government, but he did witness the reconfirmation of Magna Carta in 1237. Diocesan affairs West front of Wells Cathedral, which was constructed under Jocelin With his brother Hugh, Jocelin founded St. John's Hospital at Wells.Moorman Church Life p. 205 Jocelin promulgated a set of constitutions for the diocese, ordered that his diocesan clergy reside in their benefices, and gave land and income to the cathedral school. Glastonbury Abbey complained of Jocelin that he plundered lands of the abbey.Sayers \\"Monastic Archdeacons\\" Church and Government p. 201 footnote 141 Jocelin was also involved in mediating between William de Blois, the Bishop of Worcester, and Tewkesbury Abbey over William's rights over the abbey. Jocelin finally settled the dispute in 1232.Hoskin \\"Diocesan Politics\\" Journal of Ecclesiastical History p. 427 Jocelin funded the building of Wells Cathedral, begun at the east end in the Early English Gothic style under Reginald Fitz Jocelin. The nave was completed, the west front begun. The new cathedral was consecrated on 23 October 1239 by Jocelin. Other construction work undertaken by Jocelin included the cloisters and bishop's palace at Wells, and a manor house at Wookey. Death Jocelin died on 19 November 1242 at Wells and was buried in the choir of Wells Cathedral. He may have been the father of Nicholas of Wells.

Retrieved 14 December 2019 History Before Mansfield Town 'Field Mill' was originally the name of a large, stone-built, water-powered textile-mill with its own mill pond. The mill was located directly across the road from the present ground, being one of several situated along the River Maun water course supplied from a nearby reservoir. The mill was demolished in 1925.The Annals of Mansfield, Mansfield Museum. Retrieved 2015-12-29 The club site on Quarry Lane was originally used as a recreational area for employees of the Greenhalgh & Sons Works, who rented the surrounding areas from the Duke of Portland for their cotton-doubling business. One of the Greenhalgh sons was Harwood Greenhalgh, a Mansfield-born footballer who played for Notts County, and represented England in the first ever international football match. The Greenhalgh's team played at Field Mill under various incarnations, including 'Greenhalgh F.C.', 'Field Mill Football Club' and 'Mansfield Greenhalgh'. A team representing Greenhalgh & Sons also played cricket at the ground for many years, while the late nineteenth century saw athletics and cycle-racing on Quarry Lane. An 1894 merger with Mansfield Town (no relation to the current club) to form Mansfield F.C. saw Field Mill become almost exclusively a football ground. The ground was used by Mansfield Mechanics FC from 1912 to 1916. The home of Mansfield Town Mansfield Town first started playing matches there in the 1919‚Äì20 season, however for the first two years it was also used as a cricket ground by the Mansfield branch of the National Federation of Discharged and Disabled ex-Servicemen's Societies (DDSS). In 1921, the DDSS's lease on the ground ran out, and the ground was sold by its owner, the Duke of Portland, on the condition that it would only ever be used for sporting purposes. The first grandstand was erected in 1922 along the length of the west side of the ground, with the other three sides mounds formed from ash from nearby coal mines, all completed by 1926. In 1929, using the money from the cup run of the previous year, a covered stand was built on the Bishop Street side, occupying a similar position to the Bishop Street Stand of today. The first terracing was built during the 1930s from railway sleepers, and lasted 20 years. Floodlights were installed and officially switched on by Billy Wright on 5 October 1961 before the Football League Cup game against Cardiff City. Shortly after World War Two, concrete terracing and a PA system were introduced. The club bought land to the West side of the ground in the mid-1950s, just before the supporters' club funded the building of the new North Stand, at a cost of ¬£30,000. In the 1960s a new grandstand was erected on the west side of the ground after being purchased from Hurst Park Racecourse in Surrey. The stand itself cost ¬£30,000, although the final amount spent was considerably more than this once the cost of transportation and reconstruction is taken into account. The stand was first used in 1966, but it was not fully completed until 1971. Between 1984 and 1986, Field Mill was home to a rugby league team called Mansfield Marksman. The old scoreboard at Field Mill. After plans to relocate to a new all-seater stadium were scrapped, work began in July 1999 to completely modernise Field Mill. The North Stand, Quarry Lane End and West Stand were completely demolished and new stands built in their place, including a two tier stand on the west side of the ground. The redeveloped all-seater stadium was officially opened by John Prescott on 28 July 2001, six months after work had been completed. In July 2005, safety officials temporarily restricted Field Mill's capacity to 5,000 when fire safety certificates could not be located. The ground's capacity was again reduced in May 2007, from 9,368 to 4,684, when Nottinghamshire County Council, who enforced the reduction, cited a poor standard of stewarding and a lack of a pro-active approach to safety. In July 2007 the capacity was raised to 6,553 following an inspection from safety officials, but was reduced back to 4,684 in September after visiting Chesterfield supporters were given too many tickets by mistake. Field Mill's capacity was then increased to 5,457, and in January 2008 further increased to 7,300 for the FA Cup tie against Middlesbrough after a problem with the turnstiles and other issues were resolved. In early 2010, the Mansfield Town announced plans to allow the ground to be used to hold concerts and other events to raise non-matchday income. On 22 August 2010, Westlife brought their Where We Are Now Tour to the ground. The event was hailed a success despite not selling out and poor weather conditions affecting uncovered fans. No further concerts were announced. In December 2010, Mansfield Town were evicted from the ground by their landlord Keith Haslam following a dispute over unpaid rent. The club looked for alternative grounds at which to play their home games in the Conference National, including Alfreton Town's Impact Arena and Ilkeston Town's New Manor Ground. However, their first home game after the eviction was postponed in any event due to the freezing weather. The current owner John Radford confirmed, when announcing the stadium-purchase in 2012, that a clause in the sale precluded any use except for sports events.Radford outlines future vision at Field Mill Nottingham Post, 5 March 2012.

He was drafted in the first round in the 1990 NFL Draft. He played college football at Florida State University. NFL career In 1990, Carter was drafted in the 1st round by the 49ers, the winner of the previous 2 Super Bowls, with the hopes of taking some of the running game responsibility from Roger Craig as well as serving as the primary kick returner. He led the team in rushing in his rookie season with 460 yards after Craig missed 5 games with injury. He was the second-leading rusher in 1991 behind Keith Henderson, but then fell on the running back depth chart the following year and became almost exclusively a kick returner after that. He was a contributor in this capacity to the 49ers' Super Bowl XXIX team in . In 1996, he was selected as a member of the 50th Anniversary 49er Modern Era All-Time Team. In that after Super Bowl XXIX, he signed a free agent three-year contract with the Jets. He struggled on his new team, fumbling 7 times (losing 4) in 10 games before being cut on November 8.

He is noted as a hard working in and under midfielder. In addition to this, he is also used as a tagger. In 1995, McDonald suffered from chronic fatigue syndrome with his VAFA side Old Xaverians. He debuted in the AFL in 1997 with the Melbourne Football Club after being promoted off the Rookie list. McDonald had one of his most consistent years in 2006, being named on the interchange bench in the All Australian side and the only Demons player to make this list in that year. He laid a league high and record high 143 tackles during season 2006, breaking the previous record held by Tony Liberatore (although Brett Kirk would break McDonald's record the following season), and capped off the season with a win in Melbourne's Best and Fairest. McDonald also played in the International Rules Series in 2006. McDonald won the Melbourne best and fairest in 2007 for the second time. McDonald played his 200th game in a devastating loss to the Western Bulldogs in round 2, 2008. He was part of the Demons' Leadership Group, along with Cameron Bruce, Russell Robertson, Adem Yze and Brad Miller and was named co captain alongside Bruce in the absence of skipper David Neitz.

In practice, a tunable laser can be used to access an excited intermediate state. The selection rules associated with a two-photon or other multiphoton photoabsorption are different from the selection rules for a single photon transition. The REMPI technique typically involves a resonant single or multiple photon absorption to an electronically excited intermediate state followed by another photon which ionizes the atom or molecule. The light intensity to achieve a typical multiphoton transition is generally significantly larger than the light intensity to achieve a single photon photoabsorption. Because of this, a subsequent photoabsorption is often very likely. An ion and a free electron will result if the photons have imparted enough energy to exceed the ionization threshold energy of the system. In many cases, REMPI provides spectroscopic information that can be unavailable to single photon spectroscopic methods, for example rotational structure in molecules is easily seen with this technique. REMPI is usually generated by a focused frequency tunable laser beam to form a small-volume plasma. In REMPI, first m photons are simultaneously absorbed by an atom or molecule in the sample to bring it to an excited state. Other n photons are absorbed afterwards to generate an electron and ion pair. The so-called m+n REMPI is a nonlinear optical process, which can only occur within the focus of the laser beam. A small-volume plasma is formed near the laser focal region. If the energy of m photons does not match any state, an off-resonant transition can occur with an energy defect ŒîE, however, the electron is very unlikely to remain in that state. For large detuning, it resides there only during the time Œît. The uncertainty principle is satisfied for Œît, where —õ=h/2œÄ and h is the Planck constant (6.6261√ó10^-34 J‚àôs). Such transition and states are called virtual, unlike real transitions to states with long lifetimes. The real transition probability is many orders of magnitude higher than the virtual transition one, which is called resonance enhanced effect. Rydberg states High photon intensity experiments can involve multiphoton processes with the absorption of integer multiples of the photon energy. In experiments that involve a multiphoton resonance, the intermediate is often a low-lying Rydberg state, and the final state is often an ion. The initial state of the system, photon energy, angular momentum and other selection rules can help in determining the nature of the intermediate state. This approach is exploited in resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization spectroscopy (REMPI). The technique is in wide use in both atomic and molecular spectroscopy. An advantage of the REMPI technique is that the ions can be detected with almost complete efficiency and even time resolved for their mass. It is also possible to gain additional information by performing experiments to look at the energy of the liberated photoelectron in these experiments. Microwave detection Coherent microwave Rayleigh scattering (Radar) from REMPI has been demonstrated recently to have the capability to achieve high spatial and temporal resolution measurements, which allow for sensitive nonintrusive diagnostics and accurate determinations of concentration profiles without the use of physical probes or electrodes. It has been applied for the optical detection of species such as argon, xenon, nitric oxide, carbon monoxide, atomic oxygen, and methyl radicals both within enclosed cells, open air, and atmospheric flames.Zhili Zhang, Mikhail N. Shneider, Sohail H. Zaidi, Richard B. Miles, \\"Experiments on Microwave Scattering of REMPI in Argon, Xenon and Nitric Oxide\\", AIAA 2007-4375, Miami, FLDogariu, A. ; Michael, J. ; Stockman, E. ; Miles, R., ‚ÄúAtomic oxygen detection using radar REMPI,‚Äù in The Conference on Lasers and Electro‚ÄêOptics (CLEO)/The International Quantum Electronics Conference (IQEC) (Optical Society of America, Washington, DC, 2009) Microwave detection is based on homodyne or heterodyne technologies. They can significantly increase the detection sensitivity by suppressing the noise and follow sub-nanosecond plasma generation and evolution. The homodyne detection method mixes the detected microwave electric field with its own source to produce a signal proportional to the product of the two. The signal frequency is converted down from tens of gigahertz to below one gigahertz so that the signal can be amplified and observed with standard electronics devices. Because of the high sensitivity associated with homodyne detection method, the lack of background noise in the microwave regime, and the capability of time gating of the detection electronics synchronous with the laser pulse, very high SNRs are possible even with milliwatt microwave sources. These high SNRs allow the temporal behavior of the microwave signal to be followed on a sub- nanosecond time scale. Thus the lifetime of electrons within the plasma can be recorded. By utilizing a microwave circulator, a single microwave horn transceiver has been built, which significantly simplifies the experimental setup. Detection in the microwave region has numerous advantages over optical detection. Using homodyne or heterodyne technology, the electric field rather than the power can be detected, so much better noise rejection can be achieved. In contrast to optical heterodyne techniques, no alignment or mode matching of the reference is necessary. The long wavelength of the microwaves leads to effective point coherent scattering from the plasma in the laser focal volume, so phase matching is unimportant and scattering in the backward direction is strong. Many microwave photons can be scattered from a single electron, so the amplitude of the scattering can be increased by increasing the power of the microwave transmitter. The low energy of the microwave photons corresponds to thousands of more photons per unit energy than in the visible region, so shot noise is drastically reduced. For weak ionization characteristic of trace species diagnostics, the measured electric field is a linear function of the number of electrons which is directly proportional to the trace species concentration. Furthermore, there is very little solar or other natural background radiation in the microwave spectral region.

It runs south‚Äìnorth from Queen's Road Central, continues through Des Voeux Road Central, and ends at its intersection with Connaught Road Central. History The street was named after Lieutenant William Pedder, first lieutenant of the Nemesis, Britain's first ocean-going iron warship, and the first harbour master of Hong Kong. Pedder Street was established at the centre of Hong Kong's commerce in the early colonial days. The premises of Hong Kong's two most powerful trading hongs at the time, Dent & Co. and Jardine, Matheson & Co.,Dent & Co. and Jardine, Matheson & Co. were portrayed arch rivals at the time. were located on The Praya Central, Victoria's original waterfront, on the opposite sides of Pedder Street. Dent & Co., one of the key founding members of The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited, had a sprawling complex which stretched along the Praya, and a west wing which abutted Pedder Street. Originally, Pedder Street ran from Pedder's Hill, where the Harbour Master's Office was established, south to north ending at Pedder's Wharf on the Praya. The street was extended north by 1904 when the Praya Reclamation SchemeReclamation work was initiated by Sir C.P. Chater in 1890. finished transforming the old Praya into the modern day Des Voeux Road, along with a further stretch of land running north up to Connaught Road on which the General Post Office and Union Building were built. The new pier built at the end of Pedder Street following the reclamation was named \\"Blake Pier\\" after the city's 13th Governor. Historical buildings Pedder Wharf (1841‚Äì1890) Pedder Street, viewed from the Wharf Served as the official wharf of the colonial establishment from 1841 to 1890s.Feature: Buildings for Pedder Street since colonialisation , Sing Pao, 29 October 2005 In February 1886, the first pile of the new Pedder's Wharf was driven in from the praya wall. \\"Three similar piles have been towed over from Tsim Sha Tsui and are ready to be put in place\\". The new wharf, located at the junction of Pedder Street and Des Voeux Road, extended out from the praya wall, and was wide. Six sets of steps lead down to the water. Pedder Wharf became landlocked after the big reclamation scheme of 1890‚Äì1904, and was replaced by Blake Pier. Dent & Co offices Dent & Co offices in 1869. The palatial offices of Dent & Co. occupied the site where Gloucester Tower, The Landmark, stands today. They were originally constructed in 1850, and the site was redeveloped in 1864.Trevor Bedford, Hong Kong Land, reported in \\"Meeting heritage challenge\\", South China Morning Post, 30 November 1978 Dent & Co. went into financial distress in 1866 and sold half of its land on Pedder Street to the newly established Hongkong Hotel Company. The hotel was duly built, and became Hong Kong's first deluxe hotel. The remaining part of the west wing was let out to other trading firms. Hong Kong Hotel (1866‚Äì1926) The Hong Kong Hotel was Hong Kong's first deluxe hotel when it opened in 1866. In 1951, the hotel was closed down, and the building was bought up by a local Chinese investment group for office use. In 1957, the building was redeveloped into the present Central Building. Clock Tower (1862‚Äì1913) In 1862, at the southern end of the street where it meets Queen's Road, the Pedder Street Clock Tower was completed and was the landmark of Central until it was demolished. It chimed for the first time at midnight on 31 December 1862.Eric Cavaliero, Pedder Street was where it all happened, The Standard, 13 August 1998 The tall clock tower with a lighted dial, designed by a Mr. Rawlings,The Clock Tower, Hong Kong Illustrations of China and Its People, John Thomson 1837‚Äì1921, (London,1873‚Äì1874) was to be funded by subscriptions, but the lack of public response meant that many of the more elaborate decorative features were jettisoned. In the end, a donation was secured from Scotsman Douglas Lapraik, one of the most successful Tai-pans who founded the Hong Kong and Whampoa Dock Company, precursor of Hutchison Whampoa. The clock tower was taken down in 1913. In 1915, one of the clock faces was integrated into the clock tower at the Kowloon‚ÄìCanton Railway terminus in Tsim Sha Tsui.

In its heyday, Dent also occupied the south-western corner of Pedder Street (and Queen's Road), where it had established a \\"Tea Exchange\\". In 1846, it was transformed into the Treasury (Â∫´ÂãôÁΩ≤), Supreme Court and General Post Office. This land was auctioned in 1921, when it achieved a price of HK$50 per square foot. The resulting China Building (ËèØ‰∫∫Ë°å) was completed in 1924. Further reclamations had taken place in the meantime (ca.1900). The General Post Office was relocated in 1911 to new premises on the newly reclaimed (northern) section of Pedder Street where the wharf once was. It was a typical Edwardian municipal construction of granite and red brick, situated there until 1976; the Supreme Court was relocated in January 1912 to a new building constructed on reclaimed land, where it remained until 1985. To make way for Pedder Station of the MTR, the General Post Office was moved to Connaught Place. The old building was demolished in 1976, and World-Wide House was built in its place. Pedder Building (since 1924) Pedder Building occupied the site next to the China Building since 1924. The basement suite of the building was occupied for most of the post-war period by the auctioneering firm Lammert Bros. which had been operating in Hong Kong since 1855. The basement was occupied by Shanghai Tang's flagship store until October 2011. American clothing retailer Abercrombie & Fitch moved into the premises and three upper storeys in August 2012. Jardine House (1841 ‚Äì 1976) The first Jardine House, headquarters of Jardine, Matheson & Co., was probably built around 1841 after Jardine's successful bid for its lots on The Praya Central. In 1908, the second Jardine House was built. It was rebuilt in around 1956, and reborn in the early 1970s as Wheelock House, current headquarters of Wheelock and Company Limited, controlling shareholder of The Wharf (Holdings) Limited, a major conglomerate in Hong Kong.

The original area code is 215, which was established in 1947, while 267 and 445 are overlay codes for the same numbering plan area (NPA). In 1947, when AT&T; established the North American Numbering Plan, 215 included the entire southeastern part of the Commonwealth, from the Delaware border to the Lehigh Valley. Pennsylvania was divided into four numbering plan areas, the second most in the Bell System after New York State, a status shared with Illinois, Ohio, and Texas. On January 8, 1994, the western and northern portions of the original 215 territory, i.e. Philadelphia's western suburbs, most of Berks County, and the Lehigh Valley, changed to area code 610, while Philadelphia and its northern suburbs retained 215. However, three central office codes were moved from 215 to east-central Pennsylvania's 717, namely 267 in Denver, 484 in Adamstown and 445 in Terre Hill, with 215-267 becoming 717-336 because 717-267 was already in use. These exchanges were originally slated to move into 610, but were served by non-Bell telephone companies which sought to consolidate their eastern Pennsylvania customers into one area code. This was intended as a long-term solution, but within two years 215 was close to exhaustion due to the rapid growth of the Philadelphia area and the proliferation of cell phones and pagers. For relief, area code 267 was established as an overlay on the 215 numbering plan area on July 1, 1997. Local calls across the Delaware/Pennsylvania border were changed to ten-digit dialing. Area code 445 was first proposed in July 2000 as an overlay code on numbering plan areas 215 and 267. However, these plans were delayed and then rescinded in 2003 by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission. The need for new phone numbers in area codes 215/267 was delayed until 2018. Area code 445 was activated as an additional overlay code on February 3, 2018. This had the effect of assigning 23 million numbers to a service territory of four million people. However, despite Philadelphia's continued growth, 215/267/445 is nowhere near exhaustion. The most recent NANP exhaust projections do not list an exhaust date for the 215/267/445 territory, meaning that Philadelphia will not need a fourth area code until beyond 2050.April 2020 NANP exhaust analysis Counties served Philadelphia was located in the original numbering plan area 215; 267 was added in 1997 and 445 in 2018.

Schlesinger is widely recognized as one of the most influential and prolific scholars of medieval social history in the post-war period. Education and career Schlesinger received his doctorate at the University of Leipzig under Rudolf K√∂tzschke in 1935 and completed his second post-graduate thesis (Habilitation) under the renowned medieval historian Hermann Heimpel in 1940. Following service in the Wehrmacht and after recovering from serious injuries received during the war, Schlesinger briefly taught at the University of Leipzig, but was made to resign in 1945 due to his membership of the Nazi Party. After working for several years as an independent scholar, he was rehabilitated and taught in several West German universities, including Berlin and Frankfurt (Main). In 1964, he was awarded the chair in medieval history at the University of Marburg, where he remained until his death in 1984. Military service Like many academics of his generation, the young Schlesinger was an ardent nationalist and became a member of the Nazi Party as early as 1929. Both his teachers, K√∂tzschke and Heimpel, held similar views. By the mid-1930s, however, Schlesinger found himself increasingly at odds with the Party's ideology. His decision to write his Habilitation in medieval history under Heimpel came after a bitter falling out with K√∂tzschke's successor as professor of Landesgeschichte, the ardent Nazi historian and racial theorist Adolf Helbok. Though disillusioned with the Nazi regime, Schlesinger nonetheless joined the Wehrmacht in 1940 and was assigned a staff job that allowed him to continue his research and writing. However, when a letter he had written to his wife containing his candid views of the government and the war was intercepted by censors, he was punished by being assigned to a high-risk battalion fighting anti-Nazi in the Balkans. Scholarship Schlesinger was an active and prolific scholar who contributed to many fields of medieval history. His Habilitationschrift was published as Die Entstehung der Landesherrschaft (The Origins of Regional Lordship) in 1941 and became one of the most influential works on German social history in the post-war period. Entstehung dealt with the rise of the regional nobility in central Germany following the collapse of the Carolingian Empire. Schlesinger challenged earlier understandings about the foundations of comital (count's) power in the early Middle Ages, which had focused narrowly on office-holding and legal jurisdictions. Great regional lords in German lands, argued Schlesinger, did not come to power by assuming and privatising the privileges of public offices‚Äîsuch as that of the duke or count‚Äîthey had held under the Frankish monarchy, but drew power from their own private family lands and the customary legal authority they exercised as leaders of a band of vassals and subjects in a manner reminiscent of the ancient Germanic warrior-chieftain. This thesis stood in sharp contrast to that being promoted by another rising young scholar, Gerd Tellenbach, who believed that the nobility of France and Germany owed their origins to Frankish aristocrats placed in high positions over regions conquered by the Carolingians in the eighth and ninth centuries. Schlesinger argued in his work for the enduring influence of old Germanic attitudes about loyalty and leadership that produced a unique social structure and forms of political organization in German lands. This ethno-cultural view of history and the formation legal and political institutions was strongly represented among a number of nationalistically-oriented German and Austrian medievalists of Schlesinger's generation, including Karl Bosl, Theodor Mayer, and Otto Brunner. Schlesinger's theories about Germanic ethnicity and its influence on law and authority in medieval society were later critiqued by scholars like the Czech medievalist Frantisek Graus and the legal historian Karl Kroeschell. Schlesinger himself effectively attacked certain prevailing historical ideas as well. In a famous lecture delivered in 1963, Schlesinger sharply criticized the politically-charged field of Ostforschung (\\"East[European] Studies\\"), which for long time, but particularly during the Third Reich, had served as a thinly-veiled effort to lend scientific credibility to anti-Slavic prejudice and German domination of Poland and other parts of eastern Europe. Schlesinger insisted that the traditional paradigm of Ostforschung had been discredited and should be replaced by a broader, more interdisciplinary and historically rigorous study of East-Central Europe on its own terms, not as a tool of German politics. Accordingly, Schlesinger wrote extensively on settlement along the German-Slavic frontiers in the Middle Ages, as well as on the development of bishoprics and towns in the Saxon and Slavic areas of eastern Germany, paying particular attention to local and regional contexts for economic and demographic change. He made seminal contributions early on as well to the important Repertorium der Deutschen K√∂nigspfalzen project, which assembled detailed archaeological and historical studies of the sites which had served as royal estates or waystations on the itinerary of the medieval German kings.

Sir Frederick Widdowson Doidge (26 February 1884 - 26 May 1954) was a journalist in New Zealand and England, then a National Party member in the New Zealand House of Representatives. Biography Early life and career Doidge was born in Cootamundra, New South Wales, Australia. His father, Edwin Doidge, was a journalist in Thames, New Zealand, and founded the Cootamundra Liberal in August 1882 in competition with the Cootamundra Herald. Frederick Doidge received his training as a journalist from his father. Doidge came to New Zealand in 1902. Political career In the 1935 election, Doidge ran as an Independent in the electorate after having had a brief encounter with the anti-Labour New Zealand Democrat Party. Of the four candidates, he came second after Labour's Alexander Moncur. The next year he ran as the new National Party's candidate in the 1936 Manukau by-election, becoming the first National candidate to run for election in history. He was defeated by Labour candidate Arthur Osborne. Doidge then represented the electorate of Tauranga for National from 1938 to 1951, when he retired. He served as both Minister of External Affairs and Minister of Island Territories from 1950 to 1951 in the First National Government of New Zealand.New Zealand Parliamentary Debates, Vol. 293 (1950). Later, Doidge became New Zealand's High Commissioner to the United Kingdom from 1951 until his death. He was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George in the 1953 New Year Honours.London Gazette (supplement), No. 39735, 30 December 1952. Retrieved 28 January 2013.

The flight was formed in February 1945 to support the Allied Intelligence Bureau (AIB) and saw action over Borneo and the Netherlands East Indies (NEI) from March that year until the end of the war in August. No. 200 Flight was disbanded in December 1945.  History  From late 1943 B-24 Liberators of the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) 380th Bombardment Group were used on occasion to support Allied special operations units in the South West Pacific Area. In July two No. 24 Squadron RAAF B-24s were also modified to drop special operations personnel and conducted operations from Hollandia in this role during August.Nelmes (1994), pp. 129‚Äì130 In June 1944 it was proposed that a specialised RAAF unit be formed to provide air transport for the AIB's Z Special Unit. This proposal was supported, and No. 200 Flight was formed at Leyburn, Queensland on 20 February 1945.Nelmes (1994), pp. 128‚Äì129 Many of the flight's air and ground crew were transferred to it from No. 99 Squadron.Nelmes (1994), p. 131 The flight was controlled by the AIB and was tasked with the insertion and supply of intelligence gathering parties behind Japanese lines. Due to the secrecy of these tasks personnel from the flight were forbidden to speak about their duties at any time. No. 200 Flight's six B-24 Liberators had been modified for the unit's specialised role. The main changes were the removal of the mid-upper and ball turrets and all armour plate, the replacement of the normal radar with a Rebecca radio set and the installation of a slide at the rear of the aircraft to drop personnel and supplies.RAAF Historical Section (1995), p. 174Nelmes (1994), p. 130 No. 200 Flight began training operations with Z Special Unit immediately upon formation. Despite the priority accorded to the unit, it experienced shortages of equipment and its accommodation and maintenance facilities at Leyburn were basic. By mid-March No. 200 Flight had a strength of nine eleven-man aircrews, 450 ground crew and six B-24s. The flight began its first operations on 15 March 1945. On that day two B-24s departed Leyburn for McGuire Field in Mindoro. On 18 March these aircraft conducted a reconnaissance flight over Borneo and were subsequently joined by a third B-24. After unsuccessful attempts on 20 and 21 March, two B-24s dropped a party of eight Z Special Unit personnel near Bario on 24 March but the aircraft flown by No. 200 Flight's commanding officer, Squadron Leader Harold Graham Pockley, disappeared on its way back to base. Australian and United States Navy aircraft searched for this B-24 for two days, but did not locate its wreckage. No. 200 Flight continued to support Z Special Unit's's operations (designated 'Semut 1') around Bario for the next few months, and eventually flew in 30 of the 42 personnel involved.Nelmes (1994), p. 132 Wing Commander E. V. Read succeeded Pockley on 15 April.RAAF Historical Section (1995), p. 175 No. 200 Flight continued supporting AIB operations until the end of the war. On the night of 15/16 April three of its aircraft dropped personnel assigned to the Semut 2 operation in Borneo. It subsequently flew over 30 operations to drop AIB personnel and supplies in Borneo, Ambon, Lombok, Sumatra and Timor. These operations were successful, though the flight was hampered by the difficulty of locating its drop zones and inadequate support from the Australian First Tactical Air Force at Morotai, its main forward operational base. No. 200 Flight lost a further two B-24s in these operations; one was possibly shot down over Timor on 17 May and the other crashed either in or off the coast of north Borneo on or about 21 May. At least 46 men, including Z Special Unit operatives, were killed in the three aircraft which were lost, and this represented the highest loss rate of any of the RAAF's B-24 equipped units.Nelmes (1994), pp. 132‚Äì133 No. 200 Flight continued flying after the end of the war on 15 August 1945. It continued dropping AIB operatives and supplies until mid-October whereupon it was used to fly AIB personnel from Bougainville Island and Finschafen in New Guinea to Australia as well as to conduct courier flights. Mechanical problems were increasingly encountered in this period as a result of experienced personnel being discharged. No. 200 Flight's last sorties were made to drop leaflets and the unit was disbanded on 15 December 1945.Nelmes (1994), p. 133  See also  *B-24 Liberators in Australian service  References   Bibliography  * *  Further reading  * 200 200 Category:Military units and formations established in 1945 200 ","title":"No. 200 Flight RAAF"},{"id":"4268332","text":"In Gaussian optics, the cardinal points consist of three pairs of points located on the optical axis of a rotationally symmetric, focal, optical system. These are the focal points, the principal points, and the nodal points. For ideal systems, the basic imaging properties such as image size, location, and orientation are completely determined by the locations of the cardinal points; in fact only four points are necessary: the focal points and either the principal or nodal points. The only ideal system that has been achieved in practice is the plane mirror, however the cardinal points are widely used to approximate the behavior of real optical systems. Cardinal points provide a way to analytically simplify a system with many components, allowing the imaging characteristics of the system to be approximately determined with simple calculations. Explanation The cardinal points of a thick lens in air. F, F' front and rear focal points, P, P' front and rear principal points, V, V' front and rear surface vertices. The cardinal points lie on the optical axis of the optical system. Each point is defined by the effect the optical system has on rays that pass through that point, in the paraxial approximation. The paraxial approximation assumes that rays travel at shallow angles with respect to the optical axis, so that \\\\sin\\\\theta\\\\approx\\\\theta and \\\\cos\\\\theta\\\\approx 1. Aperture effects are ignored: rays that do not pass through the aperture stop of the system are not considered in the discussion below. Focal planes The front focal point of an optical system, by definition, has the property that any ray that passes through it will emerge from the system parallel to the optical axis. The rear (or back) focal point of the system has the reverse property: rays that enter the system parallel to the optical axis are focused such that they pass through the rear focal point. Rays that leave the object with the same angle cross at the back focal plane. The front and rear (or back) focal planes are defined as the planes, perpendicular to the optic axis, which pass through the front and rear focal points. An object infinitely far from the optical system forms an image at the rear focal plane. For objects a finite distance away, the image is formed at a different location, but rays that leave the object parallel to one another cross at the rear focal plane. Angle filtering with an aperture at the rear focal plane. A diaphragm or \\"stop\\" at the rear focal plane can be used to filter rays by angle, since: #It only allows rays to pass that are emitted at an angle (relative to the optical axis) that is sufficiently small. (An infinitely small aperture would only allow rays that are emitted along the optical axis to pass.) #No matter where on the object the ray comes from, the ray will pass through the aperture as long as the angle at which it is emitted from the object is small enough. Note that the aperture must be centered on the optical axis for this to work as indicated. Using a sufficiently small aperture in the focal plane will make the lens telecentric. Similarly, the allowed range of angles on the output side of the lens can be filtered by putting an aperture at the front focal plane of the lens (or a lens group within the overall lens). This is important for DSLR cameras having CCD sensors. The pixels in these sensors are more sensitive to rays that hit them straight on than to those that strike at an angle. A lens that does not control the angle of incidence at the detector will produce pixel vignetting in the images. Principal planes and points Various lens shapes, and the location of the principal planes. The two principal planes have the property that a ray emerging from the lens appears to have crossed the rear principal plane at the same distance from the axis that the ray appeared to cross the front principal plane, as viewed from the front of the lens. This means that the lens can be treated as if all of the refraction happened at the principal planes, and the linear magnification from one principal plane to the other is +1. The principal planes are crucial in defining the optical properties of the system, since it is the distance of the object and image from the front and rear principal planes that determines the magnification of the system. The principal points are the points where the principal planes cross the optical axis. If the medium surrounding the optical system has a refractive index of 1 (e.g., air or vacuum), then the distance from the principal planes to their corresponding focal points is just the focal length of the system. In the more general case, the distance to the foci is the focal length multiplied by the index of refraction of the medium. For a thin lens in air, the principal planes both lie at the location of the lens. The point where they cross the optical axis is sometimes misleadingly called the optical centre of the lens. Note, however, that for a real lens the principal planes do not necessarily pass through the centre of the lens, and in general may not lie inside the lens at all. Nodal points N, N' The front and rear nodal points of a thick lens. The front and rear nodal points have the property that a ray aimed at one of them will be refracted by the lens such that it appears to have come from the other, and with the same angle with respect to the optical axis. (Angular magnification between nodal points is +1.) The nodal points therefore do for angles what the principal planes do for transverse distance. If the medium on both sides of the optical system is the same (e.g., air), then the front and rear nodal points coincide with the front and rear principal points, respectively. The nodal points are widely misunderstood in photography, where it is commonly asserted that the light rays \\"intersect\\" at \\"the nodal point\\", that the iris diaphragm of the lens is located there, and that this is the correct pivot point for panoramic photography, so as to avoid parallax error. These claims generally arise from confusion about the optics of camera lenses, as well as confusion between the nodal points and the other cardinal points of the system. (A better choice of the point about which to pivot a camera for panoramic photography can be shown to be the centre of the system's entrance pupil. Item #6. On the other hand, swing-lens cameras with fixed film position rotate the lens about the rear nodal point to stabilize the image on the film.Searle, G.F.C. 1912 Revolving Table Method of Measuring Focal Lengths of Optical Systems in \\"Proceedings of the Optical Convention 1912\\" pp. 168‚Äì171.) Surface vertices The surface vertices are the points where each optical surface crosses the optical axis. They are important primarily because they are the physically measurable parameters for the position of the optical elements, and so the positions of the cardinal points must be known with respect to the vertices to describe the physical system. In anatomy, the surface vertices of the eye's lens are called the anterior and posterior poles of the lens. Modeling optical systems as mathematical transformations In geometrical optics for each ray entering an optical system a single, unique, ray exits. In mathematical terms, the optical system performs a transformation that maps every object ray to an image ray. The object ray and its associated image ray are said to be conjugate to each other. This term also applies to corresponding pairs of object and image points and planes. The object and image rays and points are considered to be in two distinct optical spaces, object space and image space; additional intermediate optical spaces may be used as well. Rotationally symmetric optical systems; Optical axis, axial points, and meridional planes An optical system is rotationally symmetric if its imaging properties are unchanged by any rotation about some axis. This (unique) axis of rotational symmetry is the optical axis of the system. Optical systems can be folded using plane mirrors; the system is still considered to be rotationally symmetric if it possesses rotational symmetry when unfolded. Any point on the optical axis (in any space) is an axial point. Rotational symmetry greatly simplifies the analysis of optical systems, which otherwise must be analyzed in three dimensions. Rotational symmetry allows the system to be analyzed by considering only rays confined to a single transverse plane containing the optical axis. Such a plane is called a meridional plane; it is a cross-section through the system. Ideal, rotationally symmetric, optical imaging system An ideal, rotationally symmetric, optical imaging system must meet three criteria: #All rays \\"originating\\" from any object point converge to a single image point (Imaging is stigmatic). #Object planes perpendicular to the optical axis are conjugate to image planes perpendicular to the axis. #The image of an object confined to a plane normal to the axis is geometrically similar to the object. In some optical systems imaging is stigmatic for one or perhaps a few object points, but to be an ideal system imaging must be stigmatic for every object point. Unlike rays in mathematics, optical rays extend to infinity in both directions. Rays are real when they are in the part of the optical system to which they apply, and are virtual elsewhere. For example, object rays are real on the object side of the optical system. In stigmatic imaging an object ray intersecting any specific point in object space must be conjugate to an image ray intersecting the conjugate point in image space. A consequence is that every point on an object ray is conjugate to some point on the conjugate image ray. Geometrical similarity implies the image is a scale model of the object. There is no restriction on the image's orientation. The image may be inverted or otherwise rotated with respect to the object. Focal and afocal systems, focal points In afocal systems an object ray parallel to the optical axis is conjugate to an image ray parallel to the optical axis. Such systems have no focal points (hence afocal) and also lack principal and nodal points. The system is focal if an object ray parallel to the axis is conjugate to an image ray that intersects the optical axis. The intersection of the image ray with the optical axis is the focal point F' in image space. Focal systems also have an axial object point F such that any ray through F is conjugate to an image ray parallel to the optical axis. F is the object space focal point of the system. Transformation The transformation between object space and image space is completely defined by the cardinal points of the system, and these points can be used to map any point on the object to its conjugate image point.

Many traditional Muslim scholars maintain that the word of God, given to the Jews and Christians had been altered. Origin The theme of tahrif was first characterised in the writings of Ibn Hazm (10th century), who rejected claims of Mosaic authorship and posited that Ezra was the author of the Torah. He also systematically organised the arguments against the authenticity of the Biblical text in the first (Tanakh) and second part (New Testament) of his book: chronological and geographical inaccuracies and contradictions; theological impossibilities (anthropomorphic expressions, stories of fornication and whoredom, and the attributing of sins to prophets), as well as lack of reliable transmission (tawatur) of the text. He explains how the falsification of the Torah could have taken place while there existed only one copy of the Torah kept by the Aaronic priesthood of the Temple in Jerusalem. Ibn Hazm's arguments had a major impact upon Muslim literature and scholars, and the themes which he raised with regard to tahrif and other polemical ideas were modified only slightly by some later authors.The Encyclopedia of Islam, BRILLPower in the Portrayal: Representations of Jews and Muslims in Eleventh- and Twelfth- Century, chapter \\"An Andalusi-Muslim Literary Typology of Jewish Heresy and Sedition\\", pp. 56 and further, Tahrif: p. 58, Under Crescent and Cross: The Jews in the Middle Ages, p. 146, Types Amin Ahsan Islahi writes about four types of tahrif:Amin Ahsan Islahi, Tadabbur-i-Qur'an, 2nd ed., vol. 1, (Lahore: Faran Foundation, 1986), p. 252 # To deliberately interpret something in a manner that is totally opposite to the intention of the author. To distort the pronunciation of a word to such an extent that the word changes completely. # To add to or delete a sentence or discourse in a manner that completely distorts the original meaning. For example, according to Islam, the Jews altered the incident of the migration of the Prophet Abraham in a manner that no one could prove that Abraham had any relationship with the Kaaba. # To translate a word that has two meanings in the meaning that is totally against the context. For example, the Aramaic word used for Jesus that is equivalent to the ' was translated as \\"son\\" whereas it also meant \\"servant\\" and \\"slave\\". # To raise questions about something that is absolutely clear in order to create uncertainty about it, or to change it completely. Quran and the claim of the distortion of the text itself Here are some of the relevant verses from Quran itself. They fall in different categories as mentioned by Islahi above. 1\\\\. So woe to their learned people, who write the Scriptures with their own hands and then say to the people, \\"This is from Allah,\\" so that they might gain some paltry worldly end. (They do not see that) this writing of their hands will bring woe to them and what they gain thereby will lead to their ruin. Baqra:79 2\\\\. O Muslims, do you then expect that these people will accept your invitation and become believers? whereas there have always been among them some who have been hearing the Word of God, understanding it well and then perverting and tampering with it knowingly. Baqra:75 3\\\\. Then, for their breach of the covenant We cast them away from Our mercy and caused their hearts to harden. (And now they are in such a state that) they pervert the words from their context and thus distort their meaning, and have forgotten a good portion of the teaching they were imparted, and regarding all except a few of them you continue to learn that they committed acts of treachery. Pardon them, then, and overlook their deeds. Surely Allah loves those who do good deeds. Al Maeda:13 4\\\\. And they do not assign to Allah the attributes due to Him when they say: Allah has not revealed anything to a mortal. Say: Who revealed the Book which Musa brought, a light and a guidance to men, which you make into scattered writings which you show while you conceal much? And you were taught what you did not know, (neither) you nor your fathers. Say: Allah then leave them sporting in their vain discourses. Al Inaam:91 5\\\\. And there is a party among them who twist their tongues while reciting the Book to make you think that it is part of the Book when in fact it is not. They say: 'It is from Allah', when in fact it is not from Allah. They falsely fix a lie upon Allah, and do so wittingly.

The son of an Armenian banker from Kayseri, Dikran Kelekian and his brother Kevork set themselves up in the antiquities business in Istanbul in 1892. The next year, Dikiran came to the United States as a commissioner for the Persian Paviliaon at the World's Columbia Exposition in Chicago. He soon established shops in New York, Paris, London, and Cairo, where he and his brother flourished as vendors selling works of art and antiquities. In 1900, Kelekian apparently served as a member of the jury for the Universal Exposition in Paris, and in 1903 he lent a number of his works to the Exposition of Muslim Arts at the Musee des Arts Decoratifs, which was also in Paris. The following year, he participated in the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair, mounting a large display of his wares and accompanying the display with an illustrated catalogue. Already by this time Kelekian seems to have been recognized by the shah of Iran for his efforts to promote Persian art and culture, and he had added the honorific title of Khan between his first and last names. Eventually, Kelekian became an American citizen, adding another country of allegiance to those of his heritage (Armenia), his birth (Turkey), and his professional interest and recognition (Iran). An expert in Islamic, and particularly Persian, pottery, he was actively involved in the sale of medieval Islamic ceramics following the finds in Rayy in the late 1880s to early 1890s, as well as the excavations begun in Raqqa in 1896 and Sultanabad and Varamin in 1905. One author sketched his character like so: \\"He is a creature so curiously compounded that, under his grim and sometimes awesome visage, he combines, in one person, the qualities of a Persian satrap and a properly accredited archangel, of Genghis Khan and the Chevalier Bayard, of Thor, the God of Thunder and Saint Francis of Assisi.\\" Kelekian was a member of the Central Board of Directors of the Armenian General Benevolent Union (AGBU) and in 1909 he funded an AGBU orphanage bearing his name in Deort Yol (in modern-day Turkey) for Armenian refugees fleeing the Adana Massacre. He was also a major donor to AGBU's various activities to save Armenians that survived the Armenian Genocide. Kelekian died in January 1951 when he fell from the twenty-third floor of the Hotel St. Moritz in New York.

It was named after the Arikara, a loose confederacy of sub-tribes of American Indians related to the Pawnee. The Arikara inhabited villages in the Missouri River valley. World War II Atlantic service The Arikara was laid down on 10 January 1943 at Charleston, South Carolina, by the Charleston Shipbuilding & Drydock Company; launched on 22 June 1943; sponsored by Mrs. Taylor F. McCoy; and commissioned on 5 January 1944, Lt. John Aitken, USNR, in command. On 15 January, the tug departed Charleston bound for Hampton Roads, Virginia. After arriving there on the 17th, she conducted shakedown training in Chesapeake Bay until the 26th. Following a post-shakedown repair period in the Norfolk Navy Yard, she stood out of the bay and shaped a northerly course. After stopping briefly at New York, Arikara moved on to Casco Bay, Maine, where she operated between 10 February and 2 March towing targets and participating in antisubmarine warfare training. She returned to New York on 4 March and began preparations for service overseas. Towing barges, the tug put to sea on 25 March as part of Task Force (TF) 67 bound for the British Isles. She reached Falmouth, England, on 20 April and, after delivering the barges, reported for duty with the 12th Fleet. On the 24th, Arikara moved to Lee-on-the-Solent to join the British tug fleet in preparing for the invasion of Europe. During the remainder of April and all of May, she towed to dispersal points on the southeastern coast of England portions of the two \\"mulberries,\\" artificial harbors to be erected on the French coast after the initial assault to provide logistical support for the movement of all Allied armies inland. On 15 May 1944, she was reclassified a fleet tug and redesignated ATF-98. Throughout the period leading up to the invasion, Arikara helped to repel German air attacks; and, though near misses shook her considerably, she suffered neither hits nor significant damage from shell fragments. Operation Overlord On the afternoon of 5 June, the tug stood out of Weymouth, England, on her way to the sector of the Normandy coast code-named by Allied planners as \\"Omaha Beach\\". After the first waves of assault troops stormed ashore, the tug began her primary assignment, clearing wrecks from the beach area reserved for the erection of the artificial harbors. Soon, however, German fire began to take such a heavy toll of landing craft that Arikara had to abandon salvage operations in favor of the even more urgent work of rescue and repair. Her work enabled the less heavily damaged landing craft to remain in action, thus maintaining the flow of troops and supplies during the critical phase of the assault on \\"Omaha\\" Beach. That phase past, the tug resumed salvage and towing work on the 7th. In all, she spent almost a month supporting the consolidation of the Normandy invasion. Though she came under air attacks and fire from shore batteries, her only major damage came from the explosion of a nearby mine while she was towing the disabled French destroyer La Surprise back to England for repairs. Her main engine room rapidly took on water which rose to within six inches of her main electric motor before her crew managed to check the leaks. Arikara completed her mission successfully, and, after 24 hours of feverish activity, her crew had her repaired and back in action off Normandy. Mediterranean service Early in July, Arikara and received orders to return to England. From there, the two tugs set out on 12 July in a convoy bound for the Mediterranean coast of North Africa. Her convoy arrived at Oran, Algeria, on the 21st; but Arikara remained there only until the end of the month. She headed for Italy on 1 August, reached Naples on the 3d, and joined Rear Admiral Spencer S. Lewis' TF 87, code-named \\"Camel\\" Force, for the mid-August invasion of southern France. Staged through Ajaccio, Corsica, Arikara's unit, the force's salvage and fire-fighting group, arrived off St. Raphael on the Mediterranean coast of France on the morning of 15 August, the day of the assault. For more than a fortnight, the tug remained in the transport area, salvaging damaged ships and landing craft, fighting fires, and keeping the approaches to the beach clear of wrecks. On 2 September, she moved to the Gulf of San Tropez, France, and began clearing wreckage from French Riviera ports. She also towed ships to Palermo, Sicily, where they underwent repairs. In addition, she made towing voyages to Naples, Marseilles, Bizerte, and Oran. Transfer to Pacific Late in October at the latter port, Arikara joined a convoy bound for the United States and headed home. She arrived in Norfolk on 7 November and remained in that vicinity into December. Late in that month, she voyaged to Trinidad where she took YFD-6 in tow before continuing on to the Panama Canal. Arikara reached the Canal Zone on 3 January 1945, transited the canal, and delivered her tow at Crist√≥bal on the 5th. The following day, she and Bannock (ATF-81) got underway for Hawaii. The tug entered Pearl Harbor later in January but remained there only until resuming her westward voyage on 4 February, bound ultimately for the Ryukyu Islands. After stops at Eniwetok and Guam, she reached Ulithi Atoll, in the Carolines, on 17 March. There, she reported for duty with Service Squadron (ServRon) 10 and began preparations for the conquest of Okinawa. Ten days later, she departed Ulithi as part of Task Group (TG) 50.8, the 5th Fleet Logistics Support Group, and headed for the Ryukyu Islands. To begin the campaign, during the last week in March, American forces took Kerama Retto, a small group of islands about 15 miles west of southern Okinawa. Then, on 1 April, the main assault force landed on Okinawa proper. Arikara spent the next 11 weeks based at Kerama Retto assisting ships and craft damaged in the struggle for Okinawa. On the night of 2 April, the tug went to the assistance of after that high-speed transport had suffered a devastating suicide crash from a Kawasaki Ki-45 \\"Nick\\" twin-engine reconnaissance/ground attack aircraft. Arikara's crew managed to extinguish the fires raging on board the Dickerson, and the tug took her in tow for Kerama Retto. In spite of Arikara's efforts, Dickerson proved to be beyond economical salvage and was towed out to sea on 4 April and sunk. Although Arikara's main mission at Okinawa was the removal and salvage of damaged landing craft, kamikaze attacks continued to add to her burdens. On 11 May, a horde of suicide planes attacked and on picket station no. 15 to the northwest of Okinawa. Arikara sped to the aid of Evans, which had sustained four suicide crashes in rapid succession. Arikara moved alongside her, put five pumps on board, made fast a hawser, and towed the destroyer into Kerama Retto for repairs. A bit over a week later, on 17 May, ‚Äî her officers and crew drained by long hours at general quarters and a night of illumination fire in support of the troops ashore ‚Äî ran aground on a reef near Naha while en route to yet another call fire mission. Arikara rushed to her aid. Just when she began taking up slack on the towline, a Japanese shore battery opened up on the stranded destroyer with uncanny accuracy. The enemy artillerists straddled Longshaw immediately, and quickly scored four hits. One of the four caused a forward magazine to detonate blowing off the bow forward of the bridge. With Longshaw a total loss, Arikara parted the towline and moved off to see to her own defense and to rescue survivors. Longshaw was later destroyed by \\"friendly\\" gunfire and torpedoes. Arikara performed salvage work in the Ry≈´ky≈´s well into June. On the 19th of that month, she took kamikaze-damaged Evans in tow and set course for the Marianas. The tug arrived at Saipan on 25 June and remained there until 11 July. From Saipan, she sailed to Leyte where she stayed through 18 August when she got underway for Japan. The tug stopped at Okinawa before proceeding on to Kyushu. She returned to Okinawa briefly in September and then continued on to the Philippines. On 9 October, while still en route to Leyte, the ship weathered a severe typhoon. After reaching Subic Bay, she underwent repairs until getting underway late in November for China. Upon reaching Tsingtao, Arikara began towing and salvage work in support of occupation forces. Late in February 1946, Arikara left China to resume operations in the eastern and Central Pacific. During the next few years, her towing and salvage operations took her to such varied locales as the Panama Canal Zone, the west coast of the United States, Hawaii, Okinawa, and the Marianas. Korean War Service In January 1950, the tug resumed occupation duty upon her arrival at Yokosuka and, for the next five months, provided towing and salvage services in Japan. However, on 25 June 1950, North Korean forces surged south across the 38th parallel into South Korea. Thus, Arikara entered her second war. She was assigned to TF 90, the Amphibious Force, Far East. Due to the skeletal nature of American naval forces in Oriental waters, her assignments early in July consisted of the unlikely duty of escorting shipping between Japan and Korea until an escort group of more suitable warships could be assembled. The tug also served as a communications ship and landing control vessel during amphibious operations at Pusan on the southeastern tip of the Korean peninsula. In addition, she performed her familiar salvage and rescue operations. After completing her initial missions at Pusan and between that port and Japan, Arikara moved to other areas of the Korean peninsula. On 5 September, she departed Yokosuka with Task Unit (TU) 90.04.3, the Pontoon Movement Unit, on her way to Inchon on the western coast of Korea. The tug supported the amphibious assault at Inchon from mid- September to mid-October, before heading, on the 16th of the latter month, for Wonsan on the northeastern coast of Korea. The 20 October amphibious assault on Wonsan, mooted by the arrival of rapidly advancing Republic of Korea (ROK) ground forces, was transformed into an enormous reinforcement and logistical support operation. Arikara spent about a month at Wonsan helping to clear the harbor and to increase its efficiency. During the latter part of November, she completed upkeep at Sasebo. Towing and salvage operations in Japanese waters occupied her during December 1950 and early January 1951. Then, on 12 January, the tug shaped a course back to the United States. Voyaging by way of the Marianas and Hawaii, she arrived in Long Beach, California, in March. By the beginning of April, Arikara was at Bremerton, Washington, undergoing repairs; and she remained there until heading back to Hawaii on 11 June. For the remainder of 1951, she operated out of Pearl Harbor making only two voyages to destinations outside the Hawaiian operating area. In July, the ship towed an AFDB to Guam; in August, she returned to Pearl Harbor; and, in October and November, she made a round-trip voyage to Subic Bay in the Philippines. On 3 January 1952, Arikara departed Pearl Harbor to deploy again to the western Pacific. By the end of the month, she was back in the Korean combat zone. During that tour of duty in the Far East, the tug served once more at Wonsan, as well as at Cho Do and Pusan, and stayed in the waters between Japan and Korea until the beginning of August. That fall, Arikara moved to the Marshall Islands to support Operation Ivy, a nuclear bomb test conducted at Eniwetok Atoll in November 1952. Although the conflict lasted into the summer of 1953, the tug saw no additional service in the Korean combat zone. By the time that an armistice ended hostilities in Korea on 27 July 1953, Arikara had already settled into a schedule of operations out of Pearl Harbor that included towing missions from Hawaii to Johnston and Kanton Island islands and duty in the Aleutians. In the fall of 1954, the tug began peacetime deployments to the Far East and, for the remainder of her Navy career, she alternated between assignments in the western Pacific with the 7th Fleet and operations out of her home port, Pearl Harbor. During the first 12 years of that period, the tug's Far Eastern itinerary included mostly Japanese, Korean, and Philippine ports of call while her operations out of Pearl Harbor took her to the waters off the coast of Alaska and surrounding the Aleutians, as well as to islands in the Central Pacific. Vietnam Service, transfer to Chile and fate Late in 1964, American involvement in the conflict in South Vietnam increased dramatically. As a consequence, Arikara began to visit the Vietnamese coast more frequently. By the fall of 1966, the tug found herself calling at such places as V≈©ng T√†u and Da Nang to provide towing and other support services for Navy units engaged in fighting communist insurgency and North Vietnamese aggression in South Vietnam. Her deployments to Asian waters along with the concomitant service in Vietnam continued into 1970. Late in February of that year, Arikara returned to Pearl Harbor from her final tour of duty with the 7th Fleet. She served actively in the Hawaiian Islands and in Alaskan waters for another 16 months. On 1 July 1971, the tug was decommissioned and simultaneously transferred to Chile as a loan under the military assistance program. She was commissioned in the Chilean Navy as Aldea (ATF-63). She was decommissioned by the Chilean Navy on 14 August 1992 and later sunk as a target. Arikara earned three battle stars during World War II, five battle stars during the Korean War, and three battle stars for service in the Vietnam War.

The flight was formed in March 1945 but the first of its modified B-24 Liberator heavy bombers was not ready until July that year. As a result, while a detachment of the unit was deployed to Darwin in the Northern Territory No. 201 Flight did not conduct any operational missions before the end of the war. Following the Japanese surrender some consideration was given to retaining the flight as part of the RAAF, but it instead ceased to function in December 1945 and was disbanded in March 1946. History No. 201 Flight was formed at RAAF Station Laverton on 10 March 1945 as radio and radar experimentation unit. Its specific role was to use modified B-24 Liberator heavy bombers to determine the characteristics of Japanese radar stations so that they could be effectively attacked by Allied aircraft.Nelmes (1994), p. 133 These tasks were considered to be highly important and secret by the RAAF, and few people outside of No. 201 Flight knew that the unit existed. In order to further protect secrecy the flight's personnel were not briefed on the purpose of the unit and its aircraft beyond their individual responsibilities. At the time it was formed No. 201 Flight was not issued with any aircraft. Its first two B-24s arrived on 5 and 27 April respectively and were transferred to No. 1 Aircraft Performance Unit (1 APU) to be modified for their specialised role. The main elements of these modifications were the removal of the ball turret and the addition of a radar scanning dome and fully enclosed radar operator's cabin. The aircraft were also fitted with an AN/APR-1 radar intercept receiver though it was hoped to replace these with AN/APR-4 sets. It took longer than expected to complete these modifications, and the first aircraft wasn't returned to No. 201 Flight until mid-July and the second aircraft was completed in either August or September. A third B-24 was also issued to the flight in August and a fourth aircraft joined it sometime afterwards.RAAF Historical Section (1995), p. 176 A detachment of about 100 No. 201 personnel were transferred to Darwin in the Northern Territory to prepare for operations while the rest of the unit remained at Ascot Vale until the B-24s were ready. The deployment of these aircraft was further delayed by bad weather at Melbourne which disrupted No. 201 Flight's training program, however. Two modified B-24s had reached Darwin by the time the war ended in mid-August, but the flight had not been able to conduct any operational missions by this time.Nelmes (1994), p. 134 In September No. 201 Flight's commanding officer, Wing Commander C.S. Davies, was informed by RAAF Headquarters that there were tentative plans to retain the unit at Laverton as part of the post-war RAAF. The Ascot Vale element of the flight moved to Laverton on 9 October, and the Darwin detachment arrived there on the 16th of the month.RAAF Historical Section (1995), pp. 176‚Äì177 No. 201 Flight conducted some test flights during November but it was ultimately decided to disband the unit.

Mediation of the Chadian- Sudanese conflict began shortly after the government of Chad declared an \\"√©tat de bellig√©rance\\", or 'state of belligerency' with Sudan. on December 23, 2005. The BBC translated \\"bellig√©rance\\" as \\"war\\". The Chadian government called for the citizens of Chad to mobilize themselves against the \\"common enemy\\", referring to militant members of the Rally for Democracy and Liberty and Platform for Change, Unity and Democracy (SCUD) rebel groups -- Chadian rebels, allegedly backed by the Sudanese government -- and Sudanese Janjaweed militiamen who have crossed over from Sudan while pursuing Fur refugees. The RDL denied they were receiving support from the Sudanese government. Between December 26 and December 28 RDL and SCUD joined with six other rebel groups to form the United Front for Democratic Change rebel alliance, led by Mohammed Nour. Sudan \\"We are very surprised by this. All the channels of communications are open between our two countries. We don't know why they are moving out of the bilateral relations to make these ... threatening statements. We will not let anyone use Sudanese soil to launch attacks against a neighbouring country,\\" said Sudanese State Minister of Foreign Affairs Al- Samani Wasiylah. Sudan has suggested that the two countries use joint border patrols, just as they previously did in 2003 to prevent attacks from Chad by Fur rebel groups into Sudan, to prevent future attacks, but Chad has thus far refused. D√©by accuses Sudan of stationing 50 armored vehicles in the Sudanese town of Geneina near the Chad-Sudan border to launch further attacks into Chad. On January 19, Sudanese authorities arrested Abdelwahit About, the former head of FIDEL and current commander within FUC, along with 19-20 other rebels depending on reports, after About gave an interview on Sudanese radio stating that he was in Khartoum and that FUC has friendly ties with the Sudanese government. \\"I think he was arrested because he had given an interview with a journalist and they discovered he was in Khartoum,\\" RDL spokesman Abdel Karim said. Karim also stated that FUC requests a meeting with the AU. The AU did not comment. African Union The AU has sent delegates to both nations. The delegation to Sudan is headed by Baba Gana Kingibe. The Chadian Foreign Ministry told the Sudanese ambassador to Chad to \\"cease all aggression against Chad.\\" On December 30 Nigerian President and then African Union chairman Olusegun Obasanjo suggested a five-way, one-day summit grouping the leaders of Egypt, Libya, Chad, Sudan and Nigeria to solve the conflict and Egypt proposed the location and date of the summit as Tripoli on January 4, 2006, but this summit has been postponed. The meeting would have discussed the AU committee report on the differences between Chad's account of the attack on Adr√© and Sudan's. United Nations The United Nations Security Council issued a statement condemning the attacks on Adr√© and supporting the mediation of the African Union, \\"It [United Nations Security Council] firmly condemned, in that context, recent attacks perpetrated by armed elements within Chad and, in particular, the attack on 19 December on positions of the Chadian national army in the town of Adr√©, and supported efforts to reduce tensions on the border... The Security Council also appeals to donors to continue both supporting the crucial work of AMIS in stemming the violence in this suffering region and providing critical humanitarian assistance to millions of war- afflicted civilians in Darfur and across the border in Chad.\\". Keith McKenzie, UNICEF's special representative to Darfur, told reporters that \\"Darfur is complicated enough without the Chadians getting involved.\\" Almost 200 United Nations aid workers left two humanitarian bases in Guereda in eastern Chad on 2006-01-22, after a meeting between UN officials and local government officials who were being briefed on the status of the 200,000 Sudanese refugees in Chad was forcibly ended by up to 100 armed men of unknown, but most likely Janjaweed, affiliation. Five Chadian government officials including the top government official of Guereda and the head of the local branch of the military police were kidnapped, jeeps belonging to two aid groups were stolen, and five local residents suffered gunshot wounds. One of the jeeps was later seen crossing into Sudan. Chadian government spokesman Doumgor told reporters on January 23 that Chadian authorities did not know who was behind the latest attack, and that kidnappers have made no demands for ransom. \\"We've had no contact from them at the moment, but the Chadian army is fanning out in the area to try and find them.\\" There will be a 20% reduction in humanitarian staff in eastern Chad with 90 UN and other aid agencies workers evacuated from Guereda and 80 workers from Iriba to regional headquarters in Abeche. Claire Bourgeois, UNHCR deputy representative in Chad, said, \\"The situation is serious enough at this stage, especially when taking into account the number of security incidents in the past days... This measure is temporary. We have kept enough staff in field offices to continue delivering services to the refugees living around Guereda and Iriba. Two NGO vehicles were reported stolen in the past four days and other partners have also been victims of robbery.\\" Organisation of the Islamic Conference On December 25, the Secretary General of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference, Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu, called for an end to hostilities between the two nations and announced support for the African Union's attempt to mediate. Egypt On December 26, Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit began an attempt to mediate the dispute between the two countries by speaking to Ahmad Allam-Mi and to the foreign minister of Sudan, Lam Akol. In an interview with Radio Cairo, Minister Gheit said that \\"Egypt is holding contacts with the United Nations in this respect as well to reach coordination with some of the regional parties and to contain the situation.\\" United States Chadian Minister Allami met with US Deputy Secretary of State Robert Zoellick on January 10. United States State Department spokesman Justin Higgins stated, \\"The deputy secretary underscored that the situation is very dangerous and expressed concern about displaced persons on both sides of the border. He [Zoellick] noted that the conflict between the parties runs the risk of endangering civilians, refugees, and internally displaced persons.\\" An anonymous State Department official said Zoellick was \\"firm and clear that Chad needed to work with Sudan to resolve this.\\" References Category:Chadian Civil War (2005‚Äì2010) ","title":"Mediation of the Chadian Civil War (2005‚Äì10)"},{"id":"4268412","text":"Hans Ree Hans Ree (born 15 September 1944 in Amsterdam) is a Dutch chess grandmaster and writer.

Cutaway sections show heating elements around the bowl containing sand. A sand bath is a common piece of laboratory equipment made from a container filled with heated sand. It is used to provide even heating for another container, most often during a chemical reaction. A sand bath is most commonly used in conjunction with a hot plate or heating mantle. A beaker is filled with sand or metal pellets (called shot) and is placed on the plate or mantle. The reaction vessel is then partially covered by sand or pellets. The sand or shot then conducts the heat from the plate to all sides of the reaction vessel. This technique allows a reaction vessel to be heated throughout with minimal stirring, as opposed to heating the bottom of the vessel and waiting for convection to heat the remainder, cutting down on both the duration of the reaction and the possibility of side reactions that may occur at higher temperatures. A variation on this theme is the water bath in which the sand is replaced with water. It can be used to keep a reaction vessel at the temperature of boiling water until all water is evaporated (see Standard enthalpy change of vaporization). Sand baths are one of the oldest known pieces of laboratory equipment, having been used by the alchemists. In Arabic alchemy, a sand bath was known as a qadr.Georges C.

He played as a forward, winger or midfielder. He also represented Italy under-21s eight times during his playing career. Club career Torino Carbone started his career at Torino, who discovered him at a youth tournament, while he played for A.S. Scilla Calcio, an amateur youth team of Scilla. He made his debut in Serie A with Torino on 15 January 1989 against Pisa, and played a further three games that season. In that season Torino were relegated to Serie B, and the following season he played 5 games in the cadets, without scoring. =Loans to Reggina, Casertana, Ascoli= He was sent on loan to Reggina the following season, also in Serie B, where he played 31 games scored five goals. In the season 1991‚Äì92, always in the lower division, he was loaned to Casertana (31 matches with four goals scored). The following season moved to Ascoli and disputed 28 games and scored six goals. Return to Torino, transfer to Napoli Carbone returned to Turin in the 1993‚Äì94 season. He made 28 appearances in the league and scored three goals. In the summer of 1994 he was purchased by Roma, but a few days later was involved in a transfer with Napoli that brought Daniel Fonseca to the Giallorossi. Carbone was valued at 7.5 billion lire. With Napoli he played 29 games and scored four goals in the league, plus 5 games and three goals in the UEFA Cup, wearing the number 10 shirt. Internazionale In the summer of 1995, he transferred to Inter for 6 billion lire. In Milan he played 31 games, scoring just two goals. On the bench the following season (from 1996 to 1997) with coach Roy Hodgson, he remained at Inter until October. Sheffield Wednesday Carbone signed for English Premier League side Sheffield Wednesday for ¬£3 million in 1996. At Wednesday Carbone played alongside his compatriot Paolo Di Canio; Carbone has spoken fondly of playing alongside the Italian striker. Carbone became the club's highest goalscorer for the 1998‚Äì99 season, scoring nine goals, and was voted the fans' favourite player and player of the season. After a contract dispute with Wednesday at the start of the 1999‚Äì2000 season over a new contract he was linked with a move away from the club. Aston Villa He joined Aston Villa for an undisclosed fee and played for a season at Villa Park, His most memorable moment came when he scored a hat-trick against Leeds United in a 3‚Äì2 win in the FA Cup, including a spectacular long range strike from 35 yards; the day before the match, Villa manager John Gregory had refused to let the homesick Italian return to his homeland, insisting he would feel better after scoring against Leeds. This, added to his strikes against Darlington and Everton, meant he contributed five goals in Villa's cup run that season. Carbone started in the FA Cup final alongside strike partner Dion Dublin in a 1‚Äì0 loss to Chelsea in the 2000 final, with Chelsea winning the match 1‚Äì0 after a goal by Roberto Di Matteo, Carbone nearly scored when his goal bound shot was cleared off the line by Frank Leboeuf. The loss meant Carbone earned an FA Cup runners-up medal by playing in the final. At the start of the 2000‚Äì01 season, several clubs including Fiorentina, Napoli, Perugia, Everton, Coventry City and Bradford City showed an interest in Carbone's services. Carbone was especially strongly linked with a move to Fiorentina to return to Serie A as a replacement for playmaker Rui Costa who was linked with leaving the club. Bradford City Bradford City, who had just escaped relegation from the Premiership the previous season and were aiming to establish themselves in the top flight, made the best offer to Carbone and he joined the Yorkshire club on a free transfer. The club also signed Stan Collymore to play alongside him. Despite some disillusionment over Carbone's wages, he scored some memorable goals and endeared himself to the Valley Parade faithful. Bradford City were relegated and, although he played the start of the following season with them as well as pledging his future to them, he later moved on loan to first Derby County, where he scored once against former club Aston Villa, and then Middlesbrough, where he again scored once in the league against Aston Villa. In 2002, after Bradford chairman Geoffrey Richmond informed him that the club would fold if they continued to pay his ¬£40,000-a-week wages. Carbone, revealed in later years that he did not want to be known as the man who made Bradford City fold and he gave up ¬£3.2 million. Later career Carbone left Bradford and returned to Italy with Como and played for Parma from 2003 to 2005. At Parma, Carbone revitalised his career under the leadership of Cesare Prandelli. Parma were in financial trouble and had to sell star players during the season such as Adrian Mutu, Adriano and Hidetoshi Nakata. During the 2003‚Äì04 season Carbone and Alberto Gilardino became the main two strikers at the club. After a one-year stint with Vicenza, Carbone signed for a four-game guest contract with the Australian team Sydney FC as a potential replacement for Dwight Yorke, who was the club's previous marquee player. He capped his debut, against Adelaide United, with two assists and a goal. After his debut many believed he would be better than Yorke,Is Benito the Dwight Choice SMH.com.au but during his third guest game he pulled a hamstring muscle that sidelined him for at least seven weeks. Carbone failed to reach an agreement with Sydney for a long-term contract, ending his short-lived career with Sydney.Sydney FC- Carbone Fail To Reach Deal SMH.com.au In 2014, Carbone revealed his disappointment in the injury which ended his spell at the club and he revealed that he would one day like to return to the club as a manager. Upon returning to Italy, Carbone joined northern side Pavia in August 2007 where he was appointed the Captain. In his first season back in the lower leagues, Carbone scored five goals in 29 appearances as Pavia finished fourth from bottom. In total he scored 31 goals in all competitions for the club and his goals helped Pavia avoid relegation.http://www.tuttocalciatori.net/Carbone_Benito Carbone was often accused of being a mercenary due to his frequently transferring between clubs. He was, however, very popular with the fans of his clubs, particularly at Sheffield Wednesday and Bradford City. He also waived much of the money owed to him‚Äîapproximately ¬£3.32 million‚Äîafter he had moved to Como, which helped City survive going into administration in 2002. International career Carbone was never capped for Italy at senior level, although he represented the Under-18 side in 1989, scoring 4 goals in 7 appearances, and he made 8 appearances with the Under-21 side between 1989 and 1994, scoring 3 goals; he was a member of the team that won the 1994 UEFA European Under-21 Championship, notably scoring the decisive penalty in the semi-final shoot-out against hosts France. In total he made 15 appearances for the Italian youth squads, scoring 7 goals. Managerial career Pavia After his retirement, Carbone accepted to stay at Pavia as youth coach, guiding the Berretti under-19 team. In March 2011 he was then promoted as head coach to replace Gianluca Andrissi. He guided Pavia to a safe place in the 2010‚Äì11 Lega Pro Prima Divisione standings, leading the club out of the relegation zone in his two months in charge of the first team. At Pavia, Carbone was given the nickname 'Harry Potter' with Pavia fans believing Carbone had worked 'magic' both as a player and Manager to help them avoid relegation. Varese After impressing as Pavia manager, On 16 June 2011 he was surprisingly announced as new head coach of Serie B club Varese, replacing local hero Giuseppe Sannino who left to become new boss of Serie A club Siena after guiding the club from Lega Pro Seconda Divisione to a spot in the promotion playoffs during his last season in charge. Joining Carbone as part of Carbone's management team at Varese was ex-Internazionale player Mauro Milanese who joined the club as Sporting Director.http://www.thefootballexpress.co.uk/2011/09/benito-carbone- new-cycle-and-new-struggles-at-varese/ On 1 October 2011, he was sackedhttp://www.laprovinciadivarese.it/stories/Cronaca/508758/ and replaced by Rolando Maran.http://www.laprovinciadivarese.it/stories/Cronaca/508759/ Saint-Christophe Vall√©e d'Aoste After being sacked by Varese, on 29 October 2012 he was installed as the new coach of Saint-Christophe Vall√©e d'Aoste in Lega Pro Seconda Divisione in place of the sacked Giovanni Zichella. Saint-Christophe Vall√©e d'Aoste were bottom of the table before Carbone took charge and he led them up the table. Carbone eventually resigned as Saint-Christophe Vall√©e d'Aoste Head Coach due to 'restrictions placed upon him'. Pursuing a career in England After leaving Saint-Christophe Vall√©e d'Aoste Carbone, who was a highly rated young manager, revealed he had turned down three to four job offers to manage in Italy, due to him wanting to pursue a management career in England. Carbone had also revealed that current Italy national football team manager Cesare Prandelli had endorsed Carbone to become a top manager. After being linked with the managerial vacancy at Sheffield Wednesday in December 2013, Carbone proclaimed that he wanted to manage the club, On 10 January 2014, Carbone appeared on Sky Sports programme 'The Fantasy Football Club' presented by his Ex-Aston Villa teammate Paul Merson and revealed that he was still interested in the role. However the club appointed caretaker manager Stuart Gray as full-time manager on 25 January after a string of impressive results. =Leeds United role= In April 2014, Massimo Cellino announced he was giving Carbone the opportunity to 'help rebuild the academy' at Leeds United, and Carbone joined the youth team set up at Thorp Arch as a sporting director.Yorkshire Post, 28 April 2014 On 14 May 2014, Carbone announced on his official Twitter page that his job title was 'Special Consultant to the Board of Directors for sport matters including Facilities & Academy'.Benito Carbone Official Twitter @CarboBenny10, 14 May 2014 The club confirmed Benito Carbone's position at the club in a statement on the club's official website on 15 May, they confirmed that Carbone 'will be involved with all football matters, including both the first team and the Academy'.

Ternana On 14 August 2016, Carbone was appointed manager of Ternana. Hired as a replacement to Christian Panucci, he resigned in January 2017 after a negative string of results that left Ternana in second-last place in the league. Crotone On 8 December 2017, Carbone was appointed assistant manager at Crotone. https://uk.sports.yahoo.com/news/zenga-appointed-crotone-boss-174424768.html Style of play A quick, mobile, talented, and creative supporting forward, with an eye for goal, Carbone was known primarily for his technical skills, his use of feints, and for his ability to provide assists for team-mates as an offensive playmaker. A versatile forward, although his preferred role was that of a second striker, he was capable of playing in several positions along the front-line or in midfield, and was also deployed as a striker, as a winger, and as an attacking midfielder throughout his career. Trivia When Carbone was at Napoli, due to his admiration for the number 10 shirt and also of his idols Diego Maradona and Roberto Baggio, Carbone had specially made shin pads for the rest of his career which featured a picture of Maradona on the left shin pad, and a picture of Baggio on the right shin pad.

ENS can be caused by minor surgical procedure as well as by major nasal surgical procedure: * major procedures: turbinate surgery (turbinectomy, turbinoplasty) for removal or reduction or modification of turbinates * minor procedures: submucosal cautery, submucosal resection, laser therapy, and cryosurgery. The condition appears to be caused by medical interventions; but its existence as a medical condition, cause, diagnosis and management are controversial. All aspects have been subject to debate, including whether it should be considered solely rhinologic, or may have neurological or psychosomatic aspects. Signs and symptoms There are no objective physical examination findings that definitely diagnose ENS. Generally, one or more turbinates may be reduced or absent when viewed in medical imaging or via endoscope with no sign of physical obstruction, the mucosa will be dry and pale, and there may be signs of secondary infection. Symptoms of ENS include a sensation of being unable to breathe, a feeling of nasal obstruction and dryness, and crusting, oozing, and foul smells inside the nose from infections. A person with ENS may complain of pain in their nose or face, an inability to sleep, fatigue, and feeling irritated, depressed, or anxious; they may be constantly distracted by the sense that they are not getting enough air. A study, found that 77% of patients with empty nose syndrome have hyperventilation syndrome. Cause The cause may be changes to the nasal mucous membrane and to the nerve endings in the mucosa resulting from chronic changes to the temperature and humidity of the air flowing inside the nose, caused in turn by removal or reduction of the turbinates. Direct damage to the nerves may be a result of surgical intervention; however, as of 2015, there is no technology that allows the mapping of the sensory nerves within the nose, so it is difficult to determine whether this is causative of ENS. Investigators have been unable to identify consistent diagnostic or precipitating features, psychological causes leading to a psychosomatic condition have been proposed. thumb Diagnosis No consensus criteria exist for the diagnosis of ENS; it is typically diagnosed by ruling out other conditions, with ENS remaining the likely diagnosis if the signs and symptoms are present. A \\"cotton test\\" has been proposed, in which moist cotton is held where a turbinate should be, to see if it provides relief; while this has not been validated nor is it widely accepted, it may be useful to identify which people may benefit from surgery. As of 2015, protocols for using rhinomanometry to diagnose ENS and measure response to surgery were under development, as was a standardized clinical instrument (a well defined and validated questionnaire) to obtain more useful reporting of symptoms. A validated ENS-specific, 6-item questionnaire called the Empty Nose Syndrome 6-item Questionnaire (ENS6Q) was developed as an adjunct to the standard Sino-Nasal Outcome Test 22 (SNOT-22). The ENS6Q is the first validated, specific, adjunct questionnaire to the SNOT-22. It can more reliably identify patients suspected of ENS. The ENS6Q is gaining usage in studies on ENS. Classification All turbinates removed ‚Äì Right lateral wall view. Anatomy of the nasal cavity Four types have been proposed: *ENS secondary to inferior turbinate resection *ENS secondary to middle turbinate resection *ENS secondary to both inferior and middle turbinate *ENS after turbinate-sparing procedures Prevention Avoiding turbinectomy or using turbinate-sparing techniques may prevent ENS. Treatment Initial treatment is similar to atrophic rhinitis, namely keeping the nasal mucosa moist with saline or oil-based lubricants and treating pain and infection as they arise; adding menthol to lubricants may be helpful in ENS, as may be use of a cool mist humidifier at home. For people with anxiety, depression, or who are obsessed with the feeling that they can't breathe, psychiatric or psychological care may be helpful. In some people, surgery to restore missing or reduced turbinates may be beneficial. thumb A 2015 meta-analysis identified 128 people treated with surgery from eight studies that were useful to pool, with an age range of 18 to 64, most of whom had been suffering ENS symptoms for many years. The most common surgical approach was creating a pocket under the mucosa and implanting material - the amount and location were based on the judgement of the surgeon. In about half the cases a filler such as noncellular dermis, a medical-grade porous high-density polyethylene, or silastic was used and in about 40% cartilage taken from the person or from a cow was used. In a few cases hyaluronic acid was injected and in a few others tricalcium phosphate was used. There were no complications caused by the surgery, although one person was over-corrected and developed chronic rhinosinusitis and two people were under-corrected. The hyaluronic acid was completely resorbed in the three people who received it at the one year follow up, and in six people some of the implant came out, but this did not affect the result as enough remained. About 21% of the people had no or marginal improvement but the rest reported significant relief of their symptoms. Since none of the studies used placebo or blinding there may be a strong placebo effect or bias in reporting. Outcomes Empty nose syndrome has been observed to affect a small proportion of people who have undergone surgery to the nose or sinuses, particularly those who have undergone turbinectomy (a procedure that removes some of the bones in the nasal passage). The incidence of ENS is variable and has not yet been quantified.Gehani NC and Houser S. Septoplasty, Turbinate Reduction, and Correction of Nasal Obstruction. Chapter 42. in Bailey's Head and Neck Surgery: Otolaryngology. Ed Jonas Johnson: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Jul 9, 2013 Untreated, the condition can cause significant and longterm physical and emotional distress in some people; some of the initial presentations on the condition described people who committed suicide. It is difficult to determine what treatments are safe and effective, and to what extent, in part because the diagnosis itself is unclear. History As early as 1914, Dr Albert Mason reported cases of \\"a condition resembling atrophic rhinitis\\" with \\"a dryness of the nose and throat\\" following turbinectomy. Mason called the turbinates \\"the most important organ in the nose\\" and claimed they were \\"slaughtered and removed with discriminate abandon more than any other part of the body, with the possible exception of the prepuce.\\" The term \\"Empty Nose Syndrome\\" was first used by Eugene Kern and Monika Stenkvist of the Mayo Clinic in 1994. Kerm and Eric Moore published a case study of 242 people with secondary atrophic rhinitis in 2001 and were the first to attribute the cause to prior sinonasal surgery in the scientific literature. Whether the condition existed or not and whether surgery was a cause, was hotly debated at Nose 2000, a meeting of the International Rhinologic Society that occurs every four years, and continued to be debated thereafter at scientific meetings and in the literature;Aaron Zitner for The Los Angeles Times. May 10, 2001 Sniffing at Empty Nose Idea as an example of how heated the debate became, in a 2002 textbook on nasal reconstruction techniques, two surgeons from University of Utrecht called turbinectomies a \\"nasal crime\\". Society and culture As of 2016, according to Spencer Payne, a doctor who studies ENS, many people with ENS symptoms commonly encounter doctors who consider their symptoms to be purely psychological;Tomas Harmon for CBS19 May 4, 2016 Medical Mystery: Empty Nose Syndrome according to Subinoy Das, another doctor who studies ENS, recognition among rhinologists was growing. People who experience ENS have formed online communities to support one another and to advocate for recognition, prevention, and treatments for ENS.Joel Oliphint for BuzzFeed.

The path is named for the indigenous Ohlone, who originally lived in the area. Route The Greenway begins in Berkeley at the east end of Ohlone Park located at Martin Luther King Jr. Way and Hearst Avenue. From there, it runs westward to the west end of the park at Sacramento and Delaware. In the segment around the North Berkeley BART Station (one block west on Delaware to Acton, then one block north on Acton to Virginia), the bike path becomes a street-running bike lane. At Virginia, the path resumes its own dedicated course just northwest of the North Berkeley BART station and runs northwestward through the cities of Albany, and El Cerrito. It terminates at San Pablo Avenue at Baxter Creek Gateway Park in Richmond at the eastern end of the Richmond Greenway. History For most of its length, the Ohlone Greenway runs along what was formerly a railroad right of way, and alongside the elevated tracks of the BART Richmond line. For most of this stretch, the Greenway is divided into two paths, one for pedestrians, the other for bicyclists. The segment from the North Berkeley BART station to Rose Street in north Berkeley was formerly the right of way of the Key System's \\"G\\" Westbrae line. The segment from Rose to just north of the El Cerrito del Norte BART station was formerly the right of way of the Santa Fe Railroad (and originally, of the California and Nevada Railroad). BART began revenue operation along the elevated tracks on January 29, 1973 and the last Santa Fe run over the route was on May 12, 1979, meaning it was possible to see both a BART train and a Santa Fe freight train alongside each other (the BART train above on the overhead elevated tracks) in the right of way which became the Ohlone Greenway. The \\"linear park\\" was constructed in conjunction with BART, and received federal funds for landscaping and beautification. In late 2006, a portion of what will eventually become a branch of the Ohlone Greenway in Berkeley south to University Avenue using another segment of the old Santa Fe right-of-way was opened between University and Delaware. In November 2007, the City of Berkeley approved the use of the old Santa Fe right-of-way south of University, extending the Ohlone Greenway branch about two blocks to Strawberry Creek Park.Oakland Tribune, Dec. 14, 2007, page 2 Metro Section The last segment between Cedar Rose Park and Delaware remained an undeveloped dirt right-of-way blocked by a fence at Cedar until late 2010 when construction began to close this gap. It was opened in late 2012. Portions of the Greenway were closed to the public from 2011 to 2014, due to a seismic retrofit project to strengthen the elevated BART tracks. The project was completed in January 2014.http://www.bart.gov/about/projects/eqs/updates#anchor7 The link extending the Greenway west from the terminus at Baxter Creek to unite with the new Richmond Greenway, which runs along the abandoned former Santa Fe Railroad right of way to Point Richmond, was completed in 2018.

He later described it as his classic Okie experience, mirroring the great migration captured in John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath and other stories of the Dust Bowl years. Brown went to high school in Los Angeles a couple of classes after Marilyn Monroe, whom he remembered by her real name and describes as \\"a quiet, plain little thing - not at all what she became later.\\" Adult life After a stint as an airplane mechanic with the U.S. Army in Cambrai - Fritsh Kaserne Darmstadt, Germany, and time spent running hot rods with his friends on local empty roads, he decided in 1962 to become an artist and moved to Humboldt County, California. Arriving in 1962 with his wife and two sons, he immediately opened the first of several Hobart Galleries; the first in Eureka, California, others in Trinidad and finally Ferndale, California. Face of War by Hobart Brown is the model for a proposed Australian War Memorial. Over the years, the Hobart Galleries has represented more than 150 local artists - launching several careers and providing much needed exposure to younger artists by adding them to an established stable of better-known names. Hobart had four children, three boys and one girl. Hobart was instrumental in helping Morris Graves settle in his beautiful home nestled in the hills outside Loleta, California. During northern hemisphere winters until 2006, Hobart migrated to Australia, where he was first artist-in-residence at Happ's Winery, later at Leeuwin Wine Estates in Margaret River, Western Australia where his public welding studio on their patio and display of his art in the winery itself were popular stops on the hourly tours. In 2006-07, Hobart was unable to travel to Australia as his increasing debility due to the advancement of his particularly severe case of rheumatoid arthritis. Following several months of being in and out of treatment facilities, he suffered a stroke on May 17, 2007. He died of pneumonia in the Redwood Memorial Hospital on November 7, 2007.

Kinetic Sculpture Races The Original People Powered Bus, Kinetic Sculpture In 1969, Hobart started the Kinetic Sculpture Race, almost by accident when he modified his son's tricycle to a five-wheeled, decorated \\"Pentacycle\\" and another local artist and gallery owner, Jack Mays, challenged him to a race down Main Street on Mother's Day. Raceday came, so did ten other challengers. Neither Hobart nor Jack won the race, that honor goes to Bob Brown (no relation) piloting his Kinetic Turtle. Hobart was acclaimed \\"the Glorious Founder\\" of the race.Welte, Jim, Kinetic King: Novato's Dave Rempe part of a winning trio in Humboldt's sculpture vehicle race, San Jose Mercury News, May 18, 2009, accessed 24 June, 2013 The races continue. 2013 was the 45th running - although the race is no longer just down the street. It now is the longest human powered sculpture race in the world. The course covers approximately 42 miles of sand, water, pavement, hills, more water, roads and freeways from Arcata to Ferndale. Meanwhile, Hobart continued to sculpt and start other races. About ten Kinetic Races occur every year, from Baltimore to Western Australia, the spirit of \\"Adults having fun so children want to get older\\" infects individuals everywhere it lands. His later years were spent battling a disfiguring and crippling rheumatoid arthritis, while his spirit -- and creative energies -- remained undiminished. He continued his twice yearly peregrinations from north to south in search of the warmest, driest times of the year. Exhibits, Collectors and Awards A sculpture of copper and brass on steel armature A few of Hobart's many exhibits have included: White House and Smithsonian Museum, Washington, D.C.; the Ronald Reagan Museum, BC Gallery, Walnut Creek, CA; LA City Museum; Palm Springs Museum; Leeuwin Estates, Australia; and the Oscar Mayer Museum. Hobart's collectors include President Ronald Reagan, Johnny Carson, Congressman Don Clausen, LA City Museum, U.S.S. Abraham Lincoln, Riverboat Casino Las Vegas, California Department of Transportation, the College of the Redwoods and more than 500 individuals and companies. Hobart created the Republican Party Perpetual Trophy by commission from the Party. Over the years, Hobart received many awards including listings in Who's Who Worldwide, being made an honorary Rotarian and annual proclamations from both the Eureka and Arcata City Councils. Not unsurprising for such a tireless showman and local booster, Hobart was covered by a full range of media including: * Television - ABC, CBS, CNN, Disney, NBC Today Show, Nickelodeon, Weird Houses and Weird Wheels, Game Show Network, and more. * Movies - \\"It will Have Blinking Eyes\\" an award-winning documentary about the Kinetic Sculpture Race by China Blue films shown at the Sundance Film Festival.Greenson, Thadeus, Kinetic Sculpture Race founder Hobart Brown dies at 74 , Eureka Times-Standard, November 8, 2007, accessed June 24, 2013 * Print - National Geographic World, Popular Mechanics, San Francisco Chronicle, Smithsonian Magazine, The Times, Los Angeles Times, Chicago Sun-Times, The Age, Perth Australia Time, Times-Standard, Arcata Eye, North Coast Journal, Humboldt Independent and The Eureka Reporter. * Radio - broadcaster for six years and many interviews. * Publications ** Kinetic Sculpture Racing, A Complete Guide: Founder Hobart Brown Tells All - a guide to Kinetic Sculpture Racing and its underlying philosophy. ** Author and co-author of numerous articles in newspapers and local journals. * Quotations ** \\"We're adults having fun so kids will want to get older.\\" ** \\"Money doesn't always bring happiness.

The numbering plan area (NPA) comprises Maryland's portion of the Greater Washington, D.C., metro area and portions of southern Maryland. This includes the communities of Cumberland, Frederick, Hagerstown, Gaithersburg, Potomac, Bethesda, Rockville, Landover and Silver Spring. History Area code 301 was one of the original area codes when the NANP was established in 1947. It served the entire state of Maryland. Much of the Washington metropolitan area is part of a local calling area which is centered on the District's area code 202, and also extends into the suburban area in southern Maryland with 301 and Northern Virginia with area code 703. From 1947 to 1990, it was possible to dial any other telephone number in the metro area as a local call with only seven digits, not using an area code, irrespective of the home area code. The entire metro area was also reachable via long- distance services by dialing area code 202, for which purpose AT&T; had established cross-referenced operator routing codes for all affected central offices.AT&T; Long Lines, Distance Dialing Reference Guide (April 1974) This was implemented via a system of central office code protection, meaning that no central office code in the metro area could exist in more than a single central office. For example, if 202-574 numbers were in use in the District or 703-574 numbers were in use in Northern Virginia, the corresponding 301-574 numbering block could only be assigned in areas considered a safe distance away from the capital, such as the Eastern Shore of Maryland. By the end of the 1980s, the Washington metropolitan area was running out of unassigned prefixes for new central offices. The only available prefixes could not be assigned without breaking seven-digit dialing in the region. With this in mind, the three local operating companies of The Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Company (C&P; Telephone, later part of Bell Atlantic and now Verizon) decided to mitigate this situation by ending the code protection scheme as of October 1, 1990, with the result that all local metro area calls between Maryland, the District of Columbia, and Virginia required dialing the area code for calls to another NPA. Area code 202 was no longer useable for suburban points. Local calls within Maryland did not require the area code.Jordan, Mary; Quimpo, Margie G. (September 23, 1990). \\"Territorial Telephones; On Oct. 1, Local Calls Will Get Complicated\\". The Washington Post. p. 1. Permissive dialing using the old dialing procedures continued from April 1, 1990, through October 1.NANPA Bellcore Information Letter IL-90/04-003 Despite the overall growth of the Baltimore‚ÄìWashington metropolitan area, 301 remained the exclusive area code for Maryland for 44 years, making Maryland one of the largest states with a single area code. By the end of the 1980s, however, it became apparent that breaking seven-digit dialing in the Washington area would not free up enough numbers north of the Potomac River to stave off the need for a new area code. Baltimore and the Eastern Shore were split off as a new numbering plan area with area code 410 on October 6, 1991. The split largely followed metro area lines. However, part of Howard County, which is recognized as part of the Baltimore area, stayed in 301, while the rest shifted to 410. Normally, when an area code is split, the largest city in the old numbering plan area retains the existing area code‚Äîin this case, Baltimore. However, Bell Atlantic wanted to spare the large number of federal agencies on the Maryland side of the metro from the expense and disruption of changing their numbers. This was intended as a long-term solution, but within four years 301 was close to exhaustion due to the proliferation of cell phones and pagers, especially in the Washington suburbs. To solve this problem, area code 240 was introduced on June 1, 1997, as the state's first overlay area code. Overlays were a new concept at the time, and met with some resistance due to the requirement for ten-digit dialing. For this reason, conventional wisdom would have suggested a split in which the Washington suburbs would have kept 301 while Frederick and points west would have shifted to 240. However, Bell Atlantic wanted to spare residents the burden of having to change their numbers. Presently, 301/240 is not projected to exhaust for at least 30 years. However, the North American Numbering Plan Administrator has assigned area code 227 as a second overlay for the region as needed. This will have the effect of assigning 23 million numbers to just over two million people. Service area The counties served by area codes 301 and 240 include Allegany, Charles, Frederick, Garrett, Howard, Montgomery, Prince George's, St. Mary's, Washington, and a very small portions of southwestern Carroll County and western Anne Arundel County. Local calls require ten-digit dialing (area code + number, leading \\"1\\" is not required).

After opening in 1987, various other locations were opened in the United States. The Knitting Factory gave its audience poetry readings, performance art, standup comedy, and musicians who transcended the usual boundaries of rock and jazz, often experimental music. The Knitting Factory owners distributed some performances to radio stations, and around 1990 starting a radio show and the record label Knitting Factory Works. Later the founders started Knitting Factory Records in 1998. History Founding in New York (1987) It was founded by Michael Dorf and Louis Spitzer in 1987. The Knitting Factory was named by Dorf's and Spitzer's childhood friend Bob Appel and songwriter Jonathan Zarov, who derived the name through joking about Appel's experience working in an actual knitting factory. Appel, a lifelong musician, joined as a co-owner and co- manager soon after its founding. John Zorn was heavily associated with the creative direction of the club in its earliest years. The original location was in Manhattan at 47 East Houston Street, near to CBGB and within walking distance of The Bottom Line. The venue was founded as an art gallery, with a performance space and cafe, as well as a home for experimental music. Within a few years, the venue relocated to a new Manhattan location at 74 Leonard St, which featured a much larger main hall that generally showcased independent rock and pop music, and two smaller subterranean stages that were initially dedicated to avant garde music. Since 1990, the Knitting Factory has sponsored the What is Jazz? Festival, a two-week long event in several locations in New York City. The event became so successful that its name was changed to the New York Jazz Festival.Bambarger, Bradley. \\"At 10, The Knitting Factory is a Powerhouse of New Music.\\" Billboard 109.5 (1 Feb. 1997): 1, 74-75. Knitting Factory Records was later founded in 1998. New clubs outside New York (2000-2007) Dorf opened a new club location in Los Angeles in 2000 under the parent company of Knitting Factory Entertainment, KnitMedia. Jared Hoffman, the founder of Instinct Records, which was acquired by Knitting Factory Entertainment in 2002, took over as CEO of the company from Dorf in 2004. In 2006 he oversaw the acquisition of concert promoters Bravo Entertainment and, in 2008, re-branded two of Bravo's clubs (one in Boise, Idaho, and another in Spokane, Washington) as Knitting Factory Concert Houses. Knitting Factory Presents then promoted a number of mainstream tours throughout the US. In 2007 The Knitting Factory partnered with XM Satellite Radio to record and broadcast concerts from both Knitting Factory locations. Ownership changes and move (2008) Morgan Margolis took over as CEO in 2008. Hoffman left the company at the end of 2008. In July 2008 the owners announced their move to close the Manhattan location and move to a much smaller space in Williamsburg, Brooklyn where it now stands at 361 Metropolitan Ave. At this new venue alternative comedy thrived, with many notable comedians gracing the stage including Hannibal Buress, Seth Herzog, Che Bridgett, Dan Ilic, and Pete Davidson. But they changed their minds and reopened the Tribeca location, and continued putting on shows with bands including The Shells, the Cro-Mags, and New Model Army (band). At that time, the New York and Hollywood locations held over 5,000 live performances each year.No author. \\"Knitting Factory Entertainment Launches Groundbreaking New Digital Content Services Initiative‚Ä¶\\" PR Newswire (10 May 2007). Reno and closures (2009-present) In July 2009 it was reported that the Los Angeles location was closing. The last show in the Manhattan location however was on July 25, 2009, and was an event called Staff Infection in which staff took to the stage and said goodbye to its beloved club. The last band to play KFNY was 12,000 Trees featuring 3 Knit staffers. The new location was set to reopen in the new Brooklyn location in July 2009. On September 9, 2009, The Knitting Factory relocated to the former space of the Luna Lounge ‚Äî itself a Manhattan transplant ‚Äî at 361 Metropolitan Avenue. This location, completely remodeled, is now in operation and has a capacity of about 300. The venue opened with a performance by Les Savy Fav. In March 2016, the Knitting Factory announced it would be closing its Reno, Nevada location. Knitting Factory Works The Knitting Factory gave its audience poetry readings, performance art, standup comedy, and musicians who transcended the usual boundaries of rock and jazz, such as the Lounge Lizards, John Zorn, Dewey Redman, Don Byron, Anthony Braxton, and Cecil Taylor. The owners recorded some of these performances and distributed them to radio stations. They started a radio show in 1990 that was broadcast nationwide, and sometime between 1989 and 1990 a record label called Knitting Factory Works. In ten years the label issued over 200 albums that included music by Marilyn Crispell, Mark Dresser, Bill Ware, Roy Nathanson, Charles Gayle, Joe Morris, and Curtis Fowlkes.

The church was consecrated in the year 1297 in the presence of King Andrew III of Hungary. In the past, the church building served for larger gatherings of townspeople or Hungarian nobles. In 1526 Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor was elected here to become the King of Hungary. During coronations, kings used to knight nobles as Knights of the Order of the Golden Spur in this church. The building was damaged several times by fire and earthquake and only a small part of its original form is preserved, most notably the presbytery. The adjacent Chapel of Saint John the Evangelist with a crypt, built in the second half of the 14th century is considered one of the finest examples of Gothic architecture in the city.  History  Legend has it that the church was built by the King Ladislaus IV of Hungary to commemorate his victory over the Czech King (P≈ôemysl) Ottokar II of Bohemia from the year 1278. It was constructed in Bratislava (known as Pressburg / Poszony for most of its history) between 1280 and 1297 in a Gothic style and consecrated by King Andrew III on 24 March 1297. It was turned into a Renaissance church in the 17th century and into a Baroque church in the 18th century. Selected persons were knighted here in the 16th - 19th centuries as Knights of the Golden Spur, each time when kings of Royal Hungary/the Kingdom of Hungary were crowned in the Cathedral of St Martin, also located within the walled city. Two chapels and a Franciscan monastery from the 14th century stand adjacent to the church. One of them, the St. John the Evangelist Chapel, contains a crypt of the family of Jakub, an important Mayor () of Pressburg (Bratislava), modelled after the French Sainte Chapelle. The spacious rooms of the monastery have been used for meetings, mayoral elections and sessions of the Regional Parliament. Interior The main altar is flanked by statues of Saint Stephan and Saint Emeric. It is a bricked pillared construction, dating 1720-1730, above which stands a glass painting from the end of the 19th century, representing the Annunciation. Two of the side altars are dedicated to the saints Francis of Assisi and Anthony of Padua; both date from 1720‚Äì1730. The other side altars are dedicated to the Nativity and Our Lady of Sorrows. Leaning against the choir, one can see the altars of Saint Anne and Saint Barbara (both from about 1750). The rococo pulpit dates from 1756. it is decorated with reliefs representing St. Francis receiving the stigmata, Saint Francis talking to the birds and Moses enforcing discipline to the Hebrews. The rood loft, built in 1670, with the organ is supported by Tuscan pillars.  Saint Reparat relic  The church contains a rare relic; the torso of Saint Reparat, deacon and Christian martyr from the 4th century. The relic is inside a purpose-built reliquary (shrine). Saint Reparat () worked as a deacon in the city of Nola near Neapoli, Italy. He died in 353, having his tongue cut out and his right hand cut off. He was buried in Rome at the cemetery of Saint Lawrence until 1769 when he was dug out at the request of Eugen K√≥sa and moved to Bratislava. Today, Saint Reparat is the patron of those wanting to change their life for the better. In the past, he was also common visiting place of students of Bratislava. Chapel of Saint John the Evangelist This chapel with a crypt was built in Gothic style in the second half of the 14th century. It was the funeral chapel of the family Jakubovec. The chapel contains statues of several saints: Francis of Assisi, Anthony of Padua, Louis IX, Clare of Assisi and Elizabeth of Hungary. The chapel is considered one of the most significant works of Gothic architecture in Slovakia. It was reconstructed in 1831.

In 2014, it merged with the website Connect2Mason to form the new student run newspaper, Fourth Estate. History Broadside, which was George Mason University's official student newspaper, began its life as The Gunston Ledger. The Gunston Ledger, whose first issue appeared on the then George Mason College campus located in Bailey's Crossroads, VA on October 15, 1963, was an eight-page monthly printed on 12 inch by 9 inch paper. Its staff of twelve students included a photograph editor, Richard Sparks, who contributed two to four photos to each issue. The content consisted of campus news, features on GMC faculty and students, engagement and wedding notices, and some commentary. The Ledger became Broadside on October 28, 1969. It was noted in that issue that the name change was part of an effort to remake the paper into more of a news instrument like the early publications of the nation's revolutionary fathers. Broadside was a weekly paper which contained sixteen or more pages in each issue. Photography in Broadside was mostly limited to campus events and personalities. Broadside began printing in a broadsheet format in 1982 (12-inch by 24-inch), but moved to a tabloid format in 1986 (printed on 12 inch by 12 inch paper). Broadside changed sizes again in fall 1992 when it began being produced in a new tabloid format (11 inch by 17 inch). It would continue to be funded by tax payer dollars and ad revenues. During that same year the newspaper began publishing twice a week on Mondays and Thursdays. The newspaper again underwent a change in format in fall 2000 when it switched back to a broadsheet (printed on 11.5-inch by 22-inch paper). Broadside remained a twice weekly publication until fall 2004 when it returned to a weekly publication. Broadside also began publishing its news on the internet in the Fall of 1996. Throughout the decades Broadside's masthead has undergone several transformations. Several designed mastheads have lasted several years, but the latest and perhaps longest tenured masthead in the 2000s was created by production editor Clayton Tompkins in 2000. The green and gold masthead, that consisted of the name Broadside in gold with a green stripe with the word's \\"George Mason University's Student Newspaper\\" typed in white and a green outline of the university's Johnson Center in a rising gold sun, was the longest tenured masthead in the publications history. It was used for nine consecutive semesters from fall 2000 through fall 2004. The content of the publication was news that was local, national, and international in scope with campus news taking the a majority of print space. Articles were presented in four different sections; news, style, opinion and sports. In Spring 2007, the paper underwent some large and noticeable changes; the online version of the newspaper was redesigned after years of neglect. A new service entitled \\"Exchange\\" launched online to serve the community and was often compared to Craigslist. New sections were also added; Business/Science/Technology and Healthy Living. However, these new sections did not last long. The print paper itself went through a major redesign, a move which was widely welcomed by the community. There were more than 70 students and staff members involved in its production. Merger The Broadside site has not been updated since 2013, and is, for all intents and purposes, defunct. In 2014, Broadside merged with Connect2Mason to form GMU Fourth Estate. All articles are now published to the Fourth Estate website and appear in the retitled Fourth Estate Weekly. Awards Broadside won several national awards throughout its history. In 2000 its website won an Associated Collegiate Press \\"Honorable Mention Award\\" and in spring 2002, student photographer David Manning won the Associated Collegiate Press \\"Photograph of the Year Award\\" for his shot of the World Bank protests in Washington, D.C.

A flexible flat cable is a type of flexible electronics. However, the term FFC usually refers to the extremely thin flat cable often found in high-density electronic applications like laptops and cell phones. Overview Sometimes the term FPC (flexible printed circuit) is even--somewhat inaccurately--used for any type of FFC, however this is more accurately used to describe etched or printed circuits that incorporate components and are built onto a flexible material. FFCs are usually straight connections without any components. FFC is a miniaturized form of ribbon cable, which is also flat and flexible. The cable usually consists of a flat and flexible plastic film base, with multiple flat metallic conductors bonded to one surface. Often, each end of the cable is reinforced with a stiffener to make insertion easier or to provide strain relief. The stiffener makes the end of the cable slightly thicker. Flexible flat cables are used in place of round cables for easy cable management, especially in high-flex applications. They usually take up less space than round cables, often offering better EMI/RFI suppression and eliminating wire- coupling issues. In addition, because the wires are protected individually and not wrapped many times over by different materials as round cables are, they are lighter in weight and offer greater flexibility. Specifications ; Pitch: The spacing of the conductors. The pitch typically refers to the distance from the center of one conductor to the center of its neighboring conductor. A single FFC can have different pitches between different conductors on the same cable, however this is uncommon. FFC cables are available in many pitches, such as 0.500 mm, 0.625 mm, 0.635 mm, 0.800 mm, 1.00 mm, 1.25 mm, 1.27 mm, 2.00 mm, 2.54 mm, but the most common pitches are 0.500 mm and 1.00 mm. Custom Pitch and Multiple Pitch FFC are available upon special request. ; Type: Some cables (described as Type 1 by W√ºrth Elektronik or Type A by Molex) have the exposed contacts on the same side at each end. Other cables (labelled Type 2 or Type D) have the exposed contacts on opposite sides of the cable (so that if the cable is lying flat, one end will have face-up contacts, and the other end will have face-down contacts). ; Exposure length: The length of the electrical contact that has been exposed at the termination of the cable. ; Stiffener: Most FFCs have some sort of extra material attached on the opposite side of the exposed length of the cable to facilitate ZIF or LIF connections. ; Conductors size: The width and thickness of the conductors Now the FFC Cables are widely used in a variety of printer connection between the head and the motherboard, plotters, scanners, copiers, stereos, LCD appliances, fax machines, DVD players and other products, a variety of signal transmission and plate board connections. In modern electrical equipment, FFC Cables can be found almost everywhere.

It is based in Milan northern Italy, and has branches in Florence, London and Paris. The most recent campuses are located in Shanghai and Shenzhen in China, Mumbai in India, and Miami in the United States. History The school was founded in Milan in 1935 by the tailor Giulio Marangoni, and became a Scuola Professionale Artistica or \\"professional art school\\" in 1942. At first the school trained mainly pattern makers and seamstresses; in the 1970s and 1980s it turned towards fashion design, product development and marketing. A London branch was opened in a former textile factory at 30 Fashion Street, Spitalfields, in 2003, and a Paris branch opened in 2006. A branch in Via de' Tornabuoni in central Florence opened in 2016. In China, branches were opened in Shanghai in 2013, and in Shenzhen in 2016. The Group opened its first school in India, in Mumbai, in July 2017. In 2010 there were about 2200 students of 70 nationalities in three campuses. In 2011 Career Education Corporation sold the Istituto Marangoni to Providence Equity Partners for a price estimated between 17 and 20 million dollars. In 2020 Providence Equity Partners then majority shareholder, sold its shares in Galileo Global Education for an amount of 2.3 billion euros as a consortium. The majority shareholders are now, CPP Investment Board and Th√©thys Invest, the holding company of the Bettencourt-Meyers family. The Marangoni is often cited as one of the most prestigious fashion schools in the world. Accreditation Since June 2016 the Istituto Marangoni has been listed by the Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Universit√† e della Ricerca, the Italian ministry of education, among the institutions authorised to award degrees in music, dance and arts. In the UK, its BA and MA programmes are validated by the Manchester Metropolitan University, which also awards master's degrees at the Paris branch.

They were named after Cornelius Vanderbilt (1794-1877), the builder of Grand Central Terminal in Midtown Manhattan. Brooklyn Vanderbilt Avenue in Brooklyn carries traffic north and south between Grand Army Plaza () and Flushing Avenue at the Vanderbilt Avenue gate of the Brooklyn Navy Yard (). This avenue serves the neighborhoods of Fort Greene and Prospect Heights. Landmarks include the old Public School 9 and Public School 9 Annex buildings at the corner of Sterling Place, and Bishop Loughlin Memorial High School at Greene Avenue. The B69 bus, which replaced a streetcar line in 1950, runs on this avenue. There were also two now-demolished subway stations on the BMT Myrtle Avenue Line and BMT Fulton Street Line built here. Manhattan Vanderbilt Avenue in Manhattan runs from 42nd Street to 47th Street between Park Avenue and Madison Avenue. It was built in the late 1860s as the result of construction of Grand Central Depot.Gray, Christopher. \\"Streetscapes/Grand Central Terminal; How a Rail Complex Chugged Into the 20th Century\\", The New York Times, June 21, 1998. Accessed October 27, 2007. \\"According to Carl Condit's 1980 book, The Port of New York, in 1860s Cornelius Vanderbilt sold his shipping interests to get control of the New York & Harlem, the New York Central, and the Hudson River Railroads.... From 1869 to 1871 the first Grand Central Station was built, 249 feet wide on 42d Street, 698 feet long on newly created Vanderbilt Avenue.\\" The southbound Park Avenue Viaduct around the Grand Central Terminal runs above the street's eastern side. The Yale Club of New York City is located on Vanderbilt Avenue, at the intersection of East 44th Street, as is the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, and One Vanderbilt supertall skyscraper. When it was originally built, it ran from 42nd Street to 49th Street. However, in the 1960s, the portion between 47th Street and 49th Street was closed permanently, as it became part of 270 Park Avenue and 280 Park Avenue. Staten Island Vanderbilt Avenue runs northeast-southwest through East Shore. It is approximately long and serves the neighborhoods of Clifton, Stapleton Heights, Concord, and Grymes Hill. The northeast end is on Bay Street (), west of Clifton of the Staten Island Railway and east of Bayley Seton Hospital. Along with parts of Richmond Road and all of Amboy Road, Vanderbilt Avenue forms the first leg of Staten Island's colonial-era eastern corridor that predates the newer, straighter, and wider Hylan Boulevard. The three roads that make up the corridor share a common numbering system, i.e. Richmond Road's numbers start where Vanderbilt Avenue's leave off, () and Amboy Road's numbers start where Amboy Road forks away from Richmond Road. This numbering system includes the numerically highest of street addresses in New York City. Other roads that fork off of this corridor are: St. Paul's Avenue, Van Duzer Street, Targee Street, Rockland Avenue, Bloomingdale Road, and Richmond Valley Road. This street is served by the S76 and S86 bus routes.

He served in the British Army's 26th (Cameronian) Regiment of Foot during the Peninsular War against Napoleon in Spain. His regiment was later transferred to Hong Kong and he began his long association with the colony. Caine was Chief Magistrate, the head of pre-Hong Kong Police Force from 1841 to 1844. The then Major Caine was appointed Colonial Secretary and Auditor General from 1846 to 1854. His role was considerably diminished after the arrival in 1849 of the new governor Sir John Bowring who stamped his authority on Hong Kong after his power struggle with Caine went all the way to the Colonial Office for resolution. He was the Colonial Secretary of Hong Kong from 1854 to 1859. He was the acting Governor of Hong Kong between May and September 1859. Caine was party to a long-running feud with William Tarrant, who, as Registrar of Deeds in 1847, accused Caine of permitting his comprador to extort vendors in Central Market. An internal government inquiry held Tarrant's claim to be baseless, and Tarrant was sacked from the civil service and effectively barred from future re-employment. Tarrant then became a journalist and after purchasing the Friend of China newspaper in 1850 repeatedly attacked Caine in its pages until the latter sued Tarrant for libel in 1859, as a result of which Tarrant was sentenced to prison.

After splitting from Nugent in 1978, St. Holmes worked with various artists, most notably the Whitford/St. Holmes project with Brad Whitford, who had recently parted ways with Aerosmith. History St. Holmes was born and raised in Riverview, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit. He received his first guitar for his eleventh birthday. He started his own neighborhood band, The Organized Confusion, and also played for high school dances. In 1974, Derek's band, \\"Scott\\", opened for an Amboy Dukes show at the Lincoln Park Theater. The Amboy Dukes and their guitar player Ted Nugent had already recorded several albums and were a staple of the Midwest rock scene at the time. When the Amboy Dukes broke up, Nugent's road manager (Phil Nicholson) contacted St. Holmes about auditioning for Nugent's project as lead singer. St. Holmes joined Ted Nugent, former Amboy Dukes bassist Rob Grange and drummer Cliff Davies to release Nugent's self-titled debut album in 1975. St. Holmes remained in Nugent's band until 1978, when he and Nugent parted ways due to personal, financial and musical differences. In 1979 Derek joined up with Ted Nugent's bass player Rob Grange, ex-Montrose drummer Denny Carmassi to form St. Paradise. They released one self-titled album for Warner Brothers in 1979 before moving on to other musical careers. In 1981, he teamed up with Aerosmith guitarist Brad Whitford for the short-lived Whitford/St. Holmes Band. In 1983, St. Holmes joined the Michael Schenker Group for its 1983 release \\"Built To Destroy\\", and also contributed to the live follow-up, \\"Rock Will Never Die\\". In 2000, St. Holmes released Then and Now, a collection of many St. Holmes' rock material. Bassist Chase Chitty (Pat Travers Band), drummer Steve Pace (Hydra, Krokus, Whitford/St. Holmes) and keyboardist Russ Still accompany St. Holmes with songs such as \\"Standing in the Rain\\", \\"Dr. Love\\" and \\"Surrounded\\", and the energy rocker \\"In Too Deep\\". On July 4, 2008 St. Holmes made a guest appearance at Ted Nugent's 6000th concert in Detroit, MI. He jammed on \\"Hey Baby\\", \\"Cat Scratch Fever\\", and \\"Stranglehold\\" with Ted. On August 24, 2008 he joined Ted Nugent on stage at Capital One Bank Theatre at Westbury in Westbury, New York. He sang and played guitar with Ted Nugent on \\"Hey Baby\\", \\"Just What The Doctor Ordered\\", \\"Dog Eat Dog\\", \\"Stormtroopin\\", \\"Cat Scratch Fever\\" and \\"Stranglehold\\". Derek has re-recorded some famous Aerosmith songs for a special promotion, and is making them available in MP3 format. Derek's versions are available online on his website. Derek sang in the Paul Reed Smith Band, co-writing songs including \\"One in the Same\\" and \\"Ice Cold Kisses\\". The eponymous CD was released in June 2010,PaulReedSmithMusic.com with a second album (Time to Testify) slated for release February 17, 2017. On December 27, 2008, St. Holmes was a special guest at a Get The Led Out concert at Ram's Head Live in Baltimore, MD. He played guitar for \\"Rock and Roll\\", then sang and played \\"Stranglehold\\" (Ted Nugent). St. Holmes is actually the voice heard in the track recording. He also performed \\"Stranglehold\\" with Get the Led Out at the Nokia in New York City on March 7, 2009 and again in Baltimore on May 15, 2010. In 2010, Derek participated in a tribute album titled Mister Bolin's Late Night Revival, a compilation of 17 previously unreleased tracks written by guitar legend Tommy Bolin prior to his death in 1976. The CD includes other artists such as HiFi Superstar, Doogie White, Eric Martin, Troy Luccketta, Jeff Pilson, Randy Jackson, Rachel Barton, Rex Carroll, Kimberley Dahme, and The 77's. A percentage of the proceeds from this project will benefit the Jackson Recovery Centers.Mister Bolin's Late Night Revival, 2010 He toured again with Nugent from 2011 to 2014. Whitford/St. Holmes reunited for a 2015 tour, and the follow-up CD Reunion was sold at these shows. Also in 2014, Derek announced that Gibson would release a signature guitar in his name later in the year. The guitar is a white Gibson SG custom with an ebony fingerboard and three humbucker pickups. The guitar is fitted with a vibrola. Derek is known for playing a variety of guitars throughout his career, including Fender Stratocasters, Gibson Les Pauls, PRS Guitars, and various Gibson hollow- bodies.

It is produced by Natural Alternatives International of San Marcos, California, for National Safety Associates (NSA; Collierville, Tennessee). Introduced in 1993, the supplements are distributed by NSA via multi-level marketing. There is no good evidence that Juice Plus offers health benefits. Many marketing claims made about Juice Plus products are false or misleading.  History  Foundation and early marketing National Safety Associates was founded in 1970 by Jay Martin, a schoolteacher-turned-entrepreneur, who continued as CEO as of 2012.Partial company history as of 2012 (archived 2013-10-13) NSA initially sold home fire-protection equipment via door-to-door salespeople. In the late 1970s, they expanded into water filtration products. In 1986, they began using multi-level marketing, then expanding their product line to air filters and educational games for pre-schoolers. In 1991, it was claimed that their sales structure constituted a ponzi scheme. In 1993, the United States Attorney General's office followed up on complaints that the company was deceptively requiring new distributors to make large upfront purchases of air and water filters. Each of the 32,000 distributors in Florida purchased an average of $7,000 worth of water filters, and many of these distributors were unable to sell all of them. The company's business in the United States decreased that year, requiring the layoff of dozens of employees. NSA later expanded its business outside the United States, and according to the company, was selling products in 33 countries as of 2000. NSA stopped manufacturing and marketing its water filter product line in 2007. Nutritional products Juice Plus was NSA's first nutritional product, launched in 1993. The primary products in the Juice Plus line include \\"Orchard Blend\\" (a fruit juice powder- based supplement) and \\"Garden Blend\\" (vegetable juice powder-based) capsules, which are sold together in a four-month pack at a cost of approximately $167 USD (2009). Other supplement products available in the Juice Plus line as of 2011 included Vineyard Blend (grape/berry juice powder-based) capsules, Juice Plus Complete (meal replacement powder), Juice Plus Chewables (Orchard and Garden Blends), and Juice Plus Chewables (Vineyard Blend). Discontinued products include Juice Plus Gummies, Juice Plus Thins (wafers), chewable tablets, and a vitamin formulation for dogs and cats.  Manufacturing  Juice Plus+ pills The main ingredients in Juice Plus Orchard Blend and Garden Blend capsules (vegetable and fruit juices) are reduced to powder through a proprietary process by an unrelated supplier, and then blended and encapsulated by NAI, who produce the finished product. Juice Plus capsules are ‚Äúenriched with pure Œ≤-carotene, ascorbic acid, vitamin E, and folic acid‚Äù. According to the manufacturer these are added to restore the levels of micronutrients lost during processing and to ensure uniformity.‚Äù Two NAI- sponsored studies mention that the fruit and vegetable powders in Juice Plus include standardized levels of natural Œ≤-carotene derived from Dunaliella salina and soy-derived d-Œ±-tocopherol (vitamin E), which are supplied by the Henkel Corporation (now doing business as Cognis Corporation), and ascorbic acid derived from acerola cherry, which is supplied by Schweizerhall Pharma.  ConsumerLab product testing Juice Plus+ Garden Blend was tested by ConsumerLab.com in their Multivitamin and Multimineral Supplements Review of 38 of the leading multivitamin/multimineral products sold in the U.S. and Canada. Testing included amounts of selected index elements, their ability to disintegrate in solution per United States Pharmacopeia guidelines, lead contamination threshold set in California Proposition 65, and meeting U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) labeling requirements. Garden Blend failed ConsumerLab's test as it contained only 76.4% of its claimed calcium, which was noted was low to start (labeled as just 4% of the Daily Value per serving.) On 23 June 2011, ConsumerLab was informed of misinformation circulated by a Juice Plus distributor incorrectly stating the variation was due to the analytical method used. ConsumerLab responded that their analytic method used was ICP-MS (Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry), a \\"highly precise and sensitive method of testing calcium\\". ConsumerLab also noted that the calcium deficiency in Juice Plus was confirmed with this method in two independent laboratories prior to publication of their Review.  Sales  Juice Plus products are marketed by individual distributors who receive sales commissions ranging from 6% (for enrolling five customers in 30 days) to 14% (for enrolling 20 customers in 30 days). Detailed sales figures for Juice Plus are not publicly available, but NSA representatives claimed that Juice Plus achieved monthly sales of $6 million USD in 1993 and that it was the company‚Äôs most successful new product. According to NSA vice-president John Blair, sales of Juice Plus in 2008 were \\"approaching 300 million but have leveled off due to economic factors.\\"  Product research  National Safety Associates, the owner of Juice Plus, claim that it is ‚Äúthe next best thing to eating fruits and vegetables‚Äù, containing the ‚Äúnutritional essence of 17 different fruits, vegetables, and grains‚Äù with key phytonutrients and that the product is absorbed by the body, reduces oxidative stress, promotes cardiovascular wellness, supports a healthy immune system, and helps protect DNA. Multiple studies have produced conflicting results as to the truth of these claims. Doubts have been raised about the advertised benefits of Juice Plus by Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, University of California Berkeley, Center for Science in the Public Interest, and other sources. The product has been criticized on the basis that: its marketing is unsupported by research data, it contains too little fruit and vegetable powder to offer significant clinical benefits, its effects can be attributed to the inclusion of added exogenous vitamins and micronutrients, and it is excessively priced relative to its potential benefits. Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Clinic referred to Juice Plus as a ‚Äúpricey supplement‚Äù that is ‚Äúdistributed through a multi-tiered marketing scheme with exaggerated value and cost.\\" Of the published peer-reviewed studies on Juice Plus products, most were funded and/or authored by the manufacturer, Natural Alternatives International (NAI); or the main distributor, NSA.; and two were funded by individual Juice Plus distributors. Nutrients and phytochemicals Concerns have been raised that the nutrients in Juice Plus+ capsules may not be bioavailable or effectively absorbed by the human body, and that some of the nutrients claimed to be in the products may not be present in significant amounts. Studies on nutrient absorption showed that subjects taking Juice Plus had elevated blood levels of folate and Œ≤-carotene, but the effects on blood levels of vitamin E and vitamin C were inconsistent. Some studies have shown significant increases in vitamin E and C levels, while other studies have shown much weaker effects on vitamin E and C levels, and that the levels of vitamin E and vitamin C are not significantly increased. Juice Plus was found to increase blood lycopene levels in several studies, while other studies have indicated that Juice Plus does not raise blood levels of lycopene or other phytochemicals in fresh fruits and vegetables such as lutein, zeaxanthin, and Œ≤-cryptoxanthin. Concerns have also been raised about the accuracy of product labeling. Three studies which included chemical analyses of Juice Plus have indicated nutrient amounts that differ from the amounts listed on the product labels. According to Consumer Reports, in 2005, National Safety Associates used advertising featuring Dr. William Sears (a distributor of Juice Plus products), which implied that Juice Plus Gummies were low in sugar and a nutritional alternative to fruits and vegetables. This claim resulted in consumer complaints to the Better Business Bureau's National Advertising Division (NAD). The BBB issued a complaint that NSA's claims were misleading, and as a result, NSA promised to modify its ads and stop calling Gummies ‚Äúthe next best thing to fruits and vegetables‚Äù. The Juice Plus homepage continues to advertise Juice Plus as ‚Äúthe next best thing to fruits and vegetables‚Äù; the Gummies product has since been discontinued; the product \\"Chewables\\" has been introduced. In December 2007, the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) filed a complaint with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to ‚Äúhalt the marketing of NSA's Juice Plus Orchard Blend and Garden Blend capsules because the products appear to be adulterated and misbranded‚Äù. CSPI said it was ‚Äúconcerned that the products' claim, ‚Äòthe next best thing to fruits and vegetables,‚Äô may lead consumers to believe the pills are closer to real fruits and vegetables than is likely to be the case.\\" According to CSPI, the labels say the capsules contain high levels of vitamins A and C and folate naturally, but ‚Äúdo not disclose that these vitamins and minerals are added to the capsules during processing and are nutrients only characteristic of the original fruit and vegetable sources.‚Äù Two nutrition specialists commented that ‚Äúthe promotional literature for Juice Plus, billed as a whole food concentrate, is a carefully worded blend of incorrect information, misleading health claims, and nonscientific jargon‚Äù and concluded that ‚ÄúJuice Plus probably won't harm you, but can hurt your pocketbook.\\" Others have provided similar skeptical assessments of Juice Plus+. In November 2007, the Complaints Resolution Panel for the Therapeutic Goods Administration Advertising Code Council ruled that statements on NSA‚Äôs Juice Plus website were in breach of Australia‚Äôs Therapeutic Goods Advertising Code. According to the panel, the ‚Äúclear message‚Äù in the ads was that Juice Plus tablets/capsules are ‚Äúequivalent to fruits and vegetables‚Äù and that ‚Äúconsuming Juice Plus tablets would help Australians to consume the ‚Äòrecommended 5‚Äì7 servings‚Äô of fruits and vegetables‚Äù. NSA was sanctioned by the Council to withdraw any representations that the products ‚Äúare equivalent to fruits and vegetables or that their consumption can aid in meeting dietary recommendations relating to fruits and vegetables.‚Äù Antioxidant activity NSA claims that Juice Plus is an effective antioxidant, and quotes a study that showed a 75% reduction in lipid peroxidation (an oxidative stress marker) in subjects that took Juice Plus for 7 to 28 days. This report was criticized as ‚Äúa particularly poor study‚Äù by nutritionist Rosemary Stanton in the Australian journal, The Skeptic. Other studies have also reported reductions in lipid peroxidation and DNA oxidation. These three studies were not blinded or placebo-controlled, included few participants (in one case no more than 15), and did not include monitoring or control of the participants' food intake. Other studies conducted under more rigorous conditions (randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, longer in duration and with more subjects), found no significant reductions in lipid peroxidation, DNA oxidation, or other markers of oxidative stress. One study, which measured in vitro antioxidant activity, found that 1 g of Juice Plus Orchard Blend/Garden Blend powder (500 mg of each combined) had the corresponding antioxidant capacity to approximately 10 g (fresh weight) of fruit or vegetable, amounting to 30 g (roughly one-third of a serving) per four capsules. Tests of antioxidant activity of polyphenols (such as those in Juice Plus capsules) in vitro likely show higher results than the negligible antioxidant activity in vivo following oral ingestion and digestion. One placebo-controlled study conducted in 2002 found that Juice Plus Gummie candies did not significantly improve the antioxidant status of children, as indicated by negative results from 6 different antioxidant tests. The authors explained this by saying it was possible that the supplement did not contain enough of the proper antioxidants to make a significant difference or that the antioxidants extracted in the fruit/vegetable extract were not bioavailable. The study was originally sponsored by NSA, but because the results were disappointing, NSA officials elected to remove the company‚Äôs name from the published article. Jim Sears, a pediatrician and Juice Plus distributor/spokesperson who co-hosts the syndicated daytime television talk show The Doctors, claimed on a February 27, 2009 episode of the program that Juice Plus \\"helps fight cancer\\". In October 2009, Dr. Barrie R. Cassileth, Chair and Chief of Integrative Medicine at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, cautioned that while Juice Plus is being \\"aggressively promoted to cancer patients based on claims of antioxidant effects\\", the supplement should not be taken by patients because it can interfere with chemotherapy, nor should it be considered a substitute for fruits and vegetables.  Cardiovascular system  Several studies have examined the effects of Juice Plus capsules on biochemical parameters associated with cardiovascular function, again with conflicting results. In October 2009, Dr. Barrie R. Cassileth, Chair and Chief of Integrative Medicine at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, noted that the results of Juice Plus studies on plasma homocysteine levels were not reproducible, and that studies on cardiovascular effects, such as blood pressure and cholesterol, were inconclusive. The effects of Juice Plus on blood levels of homocysteine have been reported in five studies, all conducted in subjects with normal homocysteine levels (15 Œºmol/L). An initial study, which was not double-blind nor placebo-controlled, reported a 37% decrease in homocysteine levels in subjects taking Juice Plus. More rigorous studies, including three that were randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, found that homocysteine levels were not reduced or were reduced to a much lesser extent than originally reported. Two randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled studies have examined the effect of Juice Plus on serum cholesterol and LDL levels. One study found that Juice Plus had no significant effects; the other found slight decreases in cholesterol (6%) and LDL (9%) in subjects that took Orchard/Garden Blend, but no reductions among subjects who took Juice Plus Vineyard blend in addition. A study reported that a combined regimen of Juice Plus Orchard Blend and Garden Blend significantly decreased the impairment of brachial artery vasoactivity caused by a high-fat meal in healthy subjects. The addition of the Vineyard Blend product to this regimen had no additional effect on brachial artery vasoactivity and led to an increase in total lipoprotein and LDL as compared with Orchard Blend/Garden Blend alone. This study also found that Juice Plus had no effect on blood pressure. In a randomized placebo-controlled, crossover study in adults with metabolic syndrome, 8-week supplementation with Juice Plus had no significant effect on vascular endothelial function, serum insulin, blood glucose, body weight, total cholesterol, or LDL cholesterol. The study, initiated in 2004 and published in 2011, was led by Juice Plus spokesman David L. Katz who received a $200,000 research grant from NSA. Adverse effects Adverse effects of Juice Plus have been mentioned in three studies, no monitoring of adverse effects was reported in other published Juice Plus studies. The first of these studies (in 2000) reported adverse effects (upper-respiratory tract, urinary, and musculoskeletal) in roughly a third of the participants who took the products for 7 days; these events resolved spontaneously and were deemed unlikely to have derived from use of Juice Plus. Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center noted that in the second of these studies, some subjects who took Orchard Blend and Garden Blend developed a hive-like rash. In the third study, from 2007, some subjects withdrew due to gastrointestinal distress, possibly caused by the Juice Plus regimen (a combination of Orchard Blend, Garden Blend, and Vineyard Blend). In addition a medical case report was published in which Juice Plus was identified as the probable cause of liver toxicity (hepatic inflammation) in a 51-year-old female patient with endometrial cancer. The liver injury was reversed upon discontinuation of Juice Plus. Conflicts of interest in studies In a critique of Juice Plus, consumer health advocate and alternative medicine critic Stephen Barrett of MLM Watch remarked upon the previous association between two authors of a 1996 Juice Plus research study and United Sciences of America, Inc. (USAI), a multilevel marketing company that sold vitamin supplements with illegal claims that they could prevent many diseases. In 1986, lead author John A. Wise, who later co-authored several other Juice Plus research studies, was USAI's Executive Vice-President of Research and Development; and second author Robert J. Morin was a scientific advisor who helped design the products. State and federal enforcement actions drove USAI out of business in 1987. Wise became a consultant to Natural Alternatives International (NAI) in 1987 and a company executive (Vice-President of Research and Development) in 1992. Barrett noted that Wise was also an NAI shareholder and that production of Juice Plus for National Safety Associates (NSA) was responsible for 16% of NAIs sales in 1999. NSAs Juice Plus website cites various research articles in support of the company's marketing claims about the biological effects of Juice Plus, maintaining that these ‚Äústudies were conducted by independent researchers‚Äù at various universities. Several of the studies were co-authored by Wise and Morin.  Advertising violations  In 2019, companies trading under the Juice Plus brand name in Italy, Germany, and the United Kingdom were levied a ‚Ç¨1 million penalty by Italy‚Äôs Competition and Market Authority (AGCM) for deceptive marketing practices in breach of European Union advertising law. The AGCM cited evidence that the companies were posting fake user testimonials alleging that the products could help with weight loss and disease treatment. The parties involved had previously been the subject of an investigation on the Italian television program Patti Chiari that looked into the sales tactics used by distributors to market the products, and which revealed the use of secret Facebook groups where distributors were posing as satisfied customers. In February 2020, the company that markets Juice Plus in Australia was hit with a $37,800 penalty by the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) subsequent to the issuance of three infringement notices relating to the promotion of Juice Plus vitamin products for medical conditions, and to the use of endorsements by health professionals, in violation of the Therapeutic Goods Advertising Code. In June 2020, the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) issued a warning letter to the Juice Plus Company for making unlawful claims that the company‚Äôs products could treat or prevent COVID-19, as well as misleading claims that business opportunity participants were likely to earn substantial income.  O.J. Simpson  University of California Berkeley Wellness Letter and MLMWatch commented on the unreliability of Juice Plus testimonials provided by former professional athlete O.J. Simpson. Simpson, known commonly as \\"O.J.\\" and \\"The Juice\\",University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law: O.J.Simpson biography signed a multi-year six-figure contract with NSA in January 1994 and became an official celebrity endorser of Juice Plus. In March 1994, Simpson was videotaped telling 4,000 Juice Plus distributors at a sales meeting that the product had cured his arthritis, improved his golf game, and freed him from using anti-arthritic drugs. However, regarding the murder of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend, Ronald Goldman, for which Simpson was tried and acquitted, Simpson claimed in his defence that he was too incapacitated by arthritis to have committed the murders and had continued to take the anti-inflammatory drug sulfasalazine. As a result of the controversy surrounding Simpson, NSA cancelled his endorsement contract and stopped using the Simpson videotape to promote Juice Plus.  Juice Plus Children's Research Foundation  The Juice Plus Children's Research Foundation (JPCRF), founded in 1997, is a non-profit medical research organization (NTEE code H99) whose stated goal is to initiate and/or support programs that advance the principle that improved nutrition leads to healthier lifestyle and overall better health in children. The foundation is chaired by executives of National Safety Associates and operates from the company's head office in Collierville, Tennessee. In fiscal year 2007, the majority of funds donated to the foundation were disbursed to Volunteers of America (a faith-based social welfare organization) and to the Boys & Girls Clubs of Memphis. The Foundation's website shows results of an ongoing customer survey (The Juice Plus Children's Health Study) which suggests a link between Juice Plus consumption and a general improvement in diet and lifestyle habits. The University of California Berkeley Wellness Letter and Stephen Barrett of MLM Watch questioned the survey's scientific value, and claimed that the Foundation is being used mainly as a marketing gimmick to get families to buy Juice Plus products. Barrett's organization Quackwatch includes the JPCRF among its list of \\"Questionable 'Research' Entities\\".

She was the inventor of the home security system (') in 1966, along with her husband Albert Brown. In the same year they jointly applied for a patent, which was granted in 1969. Brown was born in Jamaica, Queens, New York; she died there at the age of 76.  Biography  Marie Van Brittan Brown's father was born in Massachusetts and her mother was from Pennsylvania, both were African-American. Brown and her husband lived at 151-158 & 135th Avenue in Jamaica, Queens, New York. She worked as a nurse and her husband was an electrician, so they did not always have normal hours or simultaneously work. Marie and Albert Brown had two children. Their daughter, followed in her mother's footsteps and became a nurse and inventor.  Invention  Inspired by how long it would take the police to arrive in her neighborhood, Brown invented the first home security system. Her work hours were not the standard 9‚Äì5, and the crime rate in their Queens, New York City neighborhood was very high. Wondering who was on the other side of her door was always something Brown regretted doing. Brown's system had a set of three peep-holes. At the opposite side of the door a camera was attached with the ability to slide up and down to allow the person to see through each peephole. Also, a resident could unlatch the door by remote control. The system included a device that enabled a homeowner to use a television set to view the person at the door and hear the caller's voice. The home security system that she and her husband invented allowed the monitor to be in a different room, and all of this was possible via a radio controlled wireless system. If the person viewing the images on the monitor did not feel safe they could press a button that would send an alarm to police or security. She and her husband cited other inventors in their patent, such as Edward D. Phiney and Thomas J. Reardon. . Even now, over fifty years later, her invention is being used by smaller businesses and living facilities. Although the system was originally intended for domestic uses, many businesses began to adopt her system due to its effectiveness. The system also used a voice component to enable Brown to speak to the person at the door. If the person had criminal intent and tried to enter the house forcefully, the police would be notified with the push of a button. For any expected visitor or welcomed person, the door would be unlocked via remote control. For this invention of a system, she received an award from the National Science Committee. Brown was quoted in the New York Times as saying that with her invention ‚Äúa woman alone could set off an alarm immediately by pressing a button, or if the system were installed in a doctor‚Äôs office, it might prevent holdups by drug addicts.‚Äù  Home Security System  The invention was basically the first closed-circuit television security system and is predecessor to the modern home systems today. It led to the foundation for video monitoring, remote-controlled door locks, push-button alarm triggers, instant messaging to security providers and police, as well as two- way voice communication. The fame of Brown's device also led to the more prevalent CCTV surveillance in public areas. According to a 2016 New Scientist report, 100 million concealed closed-circuit cameras are now in operation worldwide.

The station operated from 1961 until 1989. History WBNB-TV was the first television station to operate in the Virgin Islands. Its construction permit was secured in 1960 by a pair of New York City-area radio men, Robert Noble and Robert Moss,\\"For the record: New TV stations- Application.\\" Broadcasting, October 13, 1958, pg. 137. who shared equal ownership in Island Teleradio Service, Inc., the original licensee of WBNB-TV and sister station WBNB radio (1000 AM, now WVWI); their names (Bob aNd Bob) served as the basis for the station's callsign. Shortly after the award, newspaper advertisements proudly announced that the station would be affiliated with CBS and NBC (but would be a primary CBS affiliate), and would also carry programs from National Educational Television (NET), the predecessor to PBS. The station began operations on July 22, 1961. The WBNB stations were split up in 1970, as channel 10 was sold to the first of five different U.S. mainland-based operators (see Ownership, below). At that point, the Moss/Noble partnership ended when Bob Noble retained sole ownership in the radio outlet, purchasing its remaining shares from Bob Moss and other minority partners. On September 17, 1989, Hurricane Hugo made landfall on the Virgin Islands, destroying WBNB-TV's transmitter in the process and knocking the station off the air. Benedek Broadcasting, who acquired the station three years earlier, did not have the financial resources to rebuild it right away. Despite remaining off-the-air (\\"dark\\" in television terminology), the station's broadcast license remained active until 1995, when the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) forced Benedek to surrender the license for cancellation on grounds of abandonment. CBS programming returned to the Virgin Islands in 2001 via WVXF (channel 17), though the network switched to TV2 in 2009 (WVXF is now a primary This TV affiliate; from then until 2019, CBS programs were shown on WMNS-LD; they are now seen on WCVI-TV). Between the early 1990s and 2001, satellite service was the only way to access CBS programs in the Virgin Islands (first via East Coast network flagship WCBS-TV, then via WSEE-TV from Erie, Pennsylvania, the latter of which remains available on cable and satellite providers in the Caribbean).

Casualties may have been as high as 100, and many more were injured. Fidel Castro charged it was an act of sabotage on the part of the United States, which denied any involvement. Events La Coubre, a 4,310-ton French vessel, was on 4 March 1960 unloading her cargo of 76 tons of Belgian munitions she had transported from the port of Antwerp in Belgium to Havana. Unloading explosive ordnance directly onto the dock in Havana was against port regulations. Ships with such cargoes were supposed to be moored in the center of the harbor and their high-risk cargo unloaded onto lighters. The ship exploded at 3:10 pm. Thirty minutes after the first explosion, while hundreds of people were involved in a rescue operation organized by the Cuban military, a second, more powerful explosion resulted in additional fatalities and injuries. At the time of the explosion, Che Guevara (who was a trained doctor) was in a meeting at the National Institute of Agrarian Reform headquarters.

Alberto Korda took photos at the March 5 memorial service at Havana's Col√≥n Cemetery, including the photo Guerrillero Heroico, which has become an iconic image of Che Guevara.The Story Behind Che‚Äôs Iconic Photo On 7 March, the Miami Herald reported charges made by Jack Lee Evans, an American who had just returned from Havana where he had been working for and living with William Alexander Morgan, an American who had commanded rebel forces during the Cuban Revolution. He said he had boarded the La Coubre on 2 March with Morgan and others to transport machine guns and ammunition to the NIAR. He then learned of a plot by an anti-communist dockworker to explode the ship, did not think Morgan was involved, and now feared for his life. Morgan denied ever being aboard the ship and said of Evans: \\"The kid has to be out of his mind to say a thing like that.\\" Morgan was arrested seven months later, accused of supporting counter-revolutionaries, and executed in March 1961. Fate of La Coubre La Coubre, named for a point of land along the Atlantic coast of France, , was towed to a dry-dock in Havana Harbor where she underwent extensive temporary repairs for five months to make her possible to be towed to France. La Coubre was towed by the Dutch merchant Oostzee to Le Havre, arriving 26 September 1960. Two tugboats moved La Coubre to the French port of Ru√°n on the Seine. Here she underwent her permanent repairs, completed in April 1961. When returned to service she continued to be owned and operated by the French Compagnie G√©n√©rale Transatlantique until 1972, when she was sold to the Dorothea shipping company in Cyprus and renamed Barbara. Later the vessel was renamed Notios Hellas and Agia Marina until 1979 when she was sold to a Spanish company to be scrapped.

The name 'Saltergate' became predominant in popular usage from the 1920s. Tightly surrounded by housing, the football stadium was located near Chesterfield's town centre on the thoroughfare of the same name. The ground underwent only limited additional development after a new main stand was opened in 1936.Basson, Stuart (2010) \\"Saltergate Sunset: The Story of the Recreation Ground, Chesterfield\\", Chesterfield F.C., p27 Although plans to develop the site were explored, the club's fans ultimately voted in favour of pursuing a new ground in a 2003 ballot, with the site confirmed by a 2006 poll. The final Chesterfield fixture at Saltergate, a Football League Two game against Bournemouth, was held on 8 May 2010. From the 2010-11 season, the team switched to the new Proact Stadium located in the Whittington Moor area of the town. An October 2010 publication from the club, Saltergate Sunset by Stuart Basson, chronicled the story of the ground. In January 2012, the football club sold the Saltergate site to Barratt Homes. Its demolition to make way for a new housing development began in April and was completed in July 2012. History 1871-1920 In 1871, Chesterfield Football Club became a distinct entity from the Chesterfield Cricket Club, from which it was formed in the previous decade. Together, they took up the tenancy at the 'New Recreation Ground', Saltergate, located just 100 yards West of their previous home, and the ground was used for both sports for more than two decades. The site hosted its first game of football on 4 November 1871, with Rotherham providing the opposition in a 14-a-side match under Sheffield Rules. 11-a-side football was first played a few weeks later against the Sheffield F.A. team.Basson, Stuart (2010) p11 A wooden pavilion was developed on the eastern side of the ground later in the 1870s but otherwise it remained simply an open field in this era. After the initial Chesterfield Football Club folded in 1881, a number of other local football teams used the pitch until the establishment of a second Chesterfield F.C. in 1884, later known as Chesterfield Town. The first recorded attendance, from Boxing Day 1889, put the crowd at 400 for a game against Sheffield Heeley Reserves. A small, uncovered grandstand with benched seating for around 400 was added early in the 1890s. With the football club steadily progressing toward employing its first semi-professional players, it was also able to take the cricket club's relocation in its stride during 1894, shouldering the full rent thereafter. League football came to Saltergate in 1899 with Chesterfield Town's election to play in Division Two of the Football League. The club's step up necessitated remedial work on a pitch that sloped markedly from north to south, most notably the removal of a hill in the north west corner, the spoil from which was dumped at the Saltergate end. In addition, the grandstand was enlarged and roofed over, its capacity increasing to around 800 spectators. Fencing was erected on the Compton Street side to obscure the free view from adjacent back gardens (modest coverage later being added on this side). After a decade of financial struggle, other clubs who had invested in their stadia vied for an opening in the league and Chesterfield Town were voted out in 1909. In a bid to return, a running track was constructed around the perimeter, said to offer up to 10,000 fans a decent view, and a white picket fence was constructed around the pitch to replace the previous wire boundary. However, any ambitions proved short-lived. Faced with the abandonment of competitive football after the outbreak of the First World War the club was forced into voluntary liquidation in 1915. A new club with the same name was formed by a local restaurateur to play wartime football at Saltergate using locally based \\"guests\\" from Football League clubs. It was shut down by the FA for illegal payments in 1917. The following year saw no senior football in Chesterfield but Saltergate was used for local cup matches. A fourth club - the present Chesterfield FC - was established in 1919 at the instigation of the local authority. A ground move to the Queen's Park Annexe also formed part of the vision, but did not progress after costings were received for a new stand. Thus the club continued to base itself at Saltergate as league football returned to the town in 1921. 1921-1939 The inter-war years represented Saltergate's main period of development. When Chesterfield F.C. became founder members of the new Third Division North in 1921, the ground saw a new spurt of improvements. According to club historian Stuart Basson: > \\"Ground development left the club with a tidy Main Stand that ran some three > quarters of the pitch length and seated 1600, a roofed Popular Side and > unovered ends. Terracing was made of cinder embankments, with a few wooden > crush barriers walloped into the dirt at random-looking intervals. A wooden > hut provided dressing room accommodation at the [northern] end of the > stand.\\" In 1931, at a time of growing ambition for the club, terracing was cut into the cinder banking of the Kop and further earth removal from the Cross Street to Saltergate end was undertaken to level the pitch. In a successful push for promotion to the Second Division in 1931-32, 20,092 fans crammed into the ground to see the home team overtake Lincoln City for the top spot. In 1936, the club borrowed around ¬£14,000 to fund the erection of a new brick and steel main stand by Scottish architect Archibald Leitch. Demolition of the old wooden stand began at the close of the 1935-36 season, which again saw the club promoted to the Second Division. The official opening of the new stand came in November, with Sheffield United visiting for a league fixture and a new record of 26,519 paying for entry. With the completion of the new stand, all four sides of the ground had taken on an appearance that would still be recognisable at the time of its closure. 1940-1979 After the Second World War, the club faced a pressing need to raise funds to service the debt on the new stand and pay off the bank loan. Further ground development became somewhat limited as a result, though the club was still in a position to buy up several houses around the ground in the late 1940s. A move away from Saltergate was proposed again in 1949, this time to a site near Walton Hospital, but the council rejected the plan. Instead, the club made what was to be its final major investment in the ground prior to the millennium, engaging Leitch and Partners to renew all the ground's cinder terracing with concrete and install their patented crush barriers. With relegation in 1951, average gates took a heavy knock and the decline continued over the decade as success eluded the club, which finally dropped to the fourth tier of English football for the first time in 1961. However, modest ground improvements still advanced after fundraising efforts by fans which allowed the Kop to be roofed in the same year. Despite acquiring second-hand lights in 1963, boardroom prevarication meant that Saltergate was the second last league ground in England to install floodlights, with Chesterfield's first home game under lights not being played until the 1967-1968 season. In 1979, the centre section of the Compton Street Terrace was re-roofed and a wooden television gantry added, the only notable ground work in the decade. 1980 onwards - stay or go? Financial problems in the early 1980s lead the board to again consider a ground move to the Queen's Park Annexe, previously considered in 1920. In the aftermath of the 1985 Bradford City stadium fire and the general upgrading of football ground safety, a number of ground adaptations were undertaken, most significantly the construction of a series of emergency exits from the main stand in the form of flights of steps down to the pitch. Hundreds of seats also had to be removed to provide more gangways. The club was also ordered to install fencing around three sides of the pitch days before the start of the 1985-1986 season. The additional cost of further works gave added spur to the idea of a move, but the discovery of a covenant on the Annexe that forbade its use for professional sport put paid to the club's favoured relocation site toward the end of the decade, though not the idea of relocation itself. The board persisted in putting forward alternate locations throughout the 1990s. Talk of relocation dominated the 1994 AGM, with a sizeable group of supporters advocating the redevelopment of Saltergate, rather than its abandonment - including the Crooked Spireite fanzine. An early proposal showed a two tier kop, with smaller seated stands on the remaining three sides. New plans for the club to leave Saltergate in favour of Wheeldon Mill emerged in October 1995 and were pursued avidly by Chairman Norton Lea in the face of substantial opposition. Though the scheme was blocked in 1998 when the Council refused planning permission, subsequent unsuccessful attempts were made to revive the move well into the next decade. Having received a dispensation from the upgrading requirements of the 1989 Taylor Report based on relocation, the club was perpetually left without a plan B. Thus, in late 2000, more than ten years after Taylor's report, the future of football at Saltergate became mired in crisis with three sides of the ground under threat of closure from the Football Licensing Authority. This was narrowly averted by a further dispensation for two sides of the ground amid turbulent times for the club under the Chairmanship of Darren Brown. Although 2001 saw a hastily organised fans group, the Chesterfield Football Supporters Society, replace Brown in controlling the club (he was later to be jailed for fraud), they faced a myriad of challenges related to ensuring Saltergate's future. It emerged that a debenture had been secured on the ground requiring that ¬£200,000 be raised in just three weeks to fight off the threat of losing the stadium. Even with that met and the club in administration, much additional fundraising was required to deal with Saltergate's worst deficiencies. Thus, the ground saw a number of modest improvements, but remained an aged stadium, lacking many of the modern facilities available to rival clubs who had relocated or redeveloped their existing grounds. In 2003, members of the Chesterfield Football Supporters Society voted in favour of the club pursuing relocation to Wheeldon Mill. A further vote in 2006 saw more than 90% back a plan to switch to the site of the former Dema Glass factory, near the Chesterfield - Sheffield bypass (Sheffield Road), around from the town centre. End of an era The 2009-10 season represented the club's last at Saltergate and its commercial department announced extensive plans to mark the 'End of an Era', including a book, DVD and end of season gala. For 8 May 2010, the date of the final game, Chesterfield Community Trust organised a number of events to celebrate the history of Saltergate and bid it farewell. A heritage project at The Pomegranate Theatre presented a visual history of the club's time at the ground, including match footage from 1923 and photos dating back to 1900. Former players, including Albert Collins of the 1945 Football League War Cup semi-final side, were also present to share their memories. Afterwards, a brass band led a parade up to the match along Chesterfield High Street, swelling to an estimated 2,000 people on arrival. Chesterfield F.C.'s final league fixture at Saltergate ended in a dramatic 2-1 win against AFC Bournemouth following an injury time goal from Derek Niven, the club's longest serving player. The goal prompted a brief and good-natured pitch invasion, which later attracted national media attention after footage of a disabled man rolling his wheelchair into the Bournemouth half attracted over 100,000 hits on YouTube.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAAD06BHZlw In the weeks following the game, Saltergate hosted a series of final commemorative events, including an auction of fixtures and memorabilia that raised ¬£20,000 for the club. Two of the crush barriers from Saltergate were also donated by the club to become museum pieces at the National Football Museum in Preston and the Scottish Football Museum in Glasgow. This had been arranged after the disused Compton Street-Cross Street corner terracing was found to include barriers designed and patented in 1906 by Scottish engineer and football ground designer Archibald Leitch, possibly the last-known examples of these once commonplace barriers. In July 2010, the handover of the new ground was completed and the club departed Saltergate as its administrative base. However, it was announced that the ground would continue in use by the Chesterfield FC Community Trust for its Saturday Morning Club and Summer holiday Soccer Camp 'for the foreseeable future'. This community use was discontinued at the start of 2011. On 31 May 2011, outline proposals for the development of up to 68 houses at the site were unanimously approved by Chesterfield Borough Council's planning committee. With planning permission obtained, the four-and-a-half acre site was put up for sale by the club in October 2011; meanwhile supporters began a Facebook Group calling for the streets in any future development to be named after former Chesterfield players. The club's development partner, GB Development Solutions, announced in December 2011 that it was close to exchanging contracts on the site and expected to complete the sale the following month. A building trade publication subsequently confirmed the sale of the ground to Barratt Homes for an undisclosed sum. In January 2012, as the prospect of demolition neared, the club announced that a pair of original 1936 seats from the Saltergate main stand would gain a permanent home at the Football League's Preston headquarters, where they were to be refurbished and located in the reception area. Demolition of the ground commenced in April 2012. By the end of June 2012, demolition of the structure was almost complete: the pitch had been removed, all four stands demolished and three of the floodlight pylons levelled. Work on rubble removal and levelling of the site was ongoing. In early July 2012, Barratt Homes began publicising details of the development to potential purchasers, stating that the first homes on the site would be available for occupancy in Autumn 2012. The final floodlight pylon - and last remaining Saltergate structure - was levelled on 13 July. Initial construction of the roads and first plots began at the end of July 2012. In September 2012, Chesterfield Borough Council invited fans to nominate possible names for the road at the new development, from which seven options were subsequently put to the popular vote in an online poll. In December 2012, the winning street name was announced as 'Spire Heights', a play on the club nickname 'Spireites' when pronounced with a local accent. In the autumn of 2014 Chesterfield Borough Council commissioned local artist Melanie Jackson to design a piece of artwork to mark the site of the football ground. The work, the \\"Spirit of Saltergate\\" was developed in consultation with supporters and was installed in March 2015. The artwork consists of a railing depicting the ground and fans as well as a tree guard and a series of bronze inlays linked to multimedia works. Structure and facilities At the time of its closure, the four sides of the stadium were: The Main Stand, which was all-seated and contained an area designated as the Family Stand; the Spion Kop - the main terrace - known as the Karen Child Kop from 2008 for sponsorship reasons; the Compton Street Stand, running the full length of the pitch opposite the Main Stand; and the Cross Street End, an open terrace where away fans usually stood. Main Stand Main Stand pictured from the KopThe covered Main Stand was opened in 1936 and was built at a cost of ¬£14,000. In this era, the stand had 2 tiers, the bottom level being narrow terracing which did not require a tunnel for the players, who instead emerged through a door. This terracing was taken out of use in the late 20th century. For the 2009-10 season it accommodated 2000 home supporters plus 450 seats for away fans. The stand was unusual, when viewed from aerial shot, in having a slight bend just to the right of halfway. In its later incarnation, it was also unusual in having its seating area raised above the pitch with a number of stairwells at the front of the stand leading up to the seats. There were also a number of supporting pillars in the stand which gave many seats a restricted view. In its later years, the badly peeling paint and rusted exterior of the stand frequently attracted the derision of rival supporters. Since the design and appearance of the stand were similar that which stood at Derby County's now demolished Baseball Ground (by the same architect), the Saltergate structure was used to depict it in the 2009 film The Damned United, set in the 1970s. The Kop (Saltergate End) The Kop, filling early for the farewell game, May 2010The Kop was the main terrace, accessed via turnstiles on Saltergate, the street which gives rise to the ground's popular name. As the area behind the goal, it tended to attract the club's most vocal standing support. For the 2009-10 season, its capacity was approximately 2,000 . As with many Victorian era football facilities, the Saltergate end of the ground spent many years as little more than a sloping mound. In the early 1920s, the construction of Cross Street at the opposite end of the ground led to earth and remnants of the cinder running track being used to build up the banking of the Kop. Terraced steps were cut into the cinder in the summer of 1931. At the turn of the 1950s, this was replaced by concrete terracing, cut to go below pitch level. Metal crush barriers were also fitted, replacing the old wooden ones. The Kop was roofed in 1960/1, at a cost of ¬£10,000, paid for entirely by fundraising by the supporters club. In December 2000, The Kop was closed for the remainder of the season on orders of the Football Licensing Authority and a major upgrading effort became one of the many summer challenges facing the fans who had taken over the club. Commencing at the start of July, a complete renewal of terracing work was completed in just 7 weeks. Of the four sides of the ground, the Kop offered the most potential for redevelopment because of a relative abundance of space and was thus the focal point of all plans drawn up to keep the club at its historic home. 2002 architect plans envisaged a mix of seating and standing for a revamped Saltergate end. In the absence of any such redevelopment, The Kop saw only a change of sponsorship in its closing years, becoming 'The Karen Child Kop' through a ¬£20,000 deal with a local lottery winner. Fans standing on the Kop for Saltergate's final fixture were experiencing not just their last game at the ground, but also their last opportunity to watch a Chesterfield home game from terracing, the new stadium being all-seater. Compton Street Stand (Pop Side)  Compton Street Stand in 2007.Compton Street, also known as the Popular or Pop Side, had a capacity of around 1,000 at the time of closure - the smallest of the four sides. It was partly covered (to the rear) and had a row of supporting pillars. Originally a terrace constructed in the early 1920s, Compton Street had a lot of work carried out on it during 2002 and was made all seated. The seating area lay about 4 metres from the pitch line. The roof had an unusual wooden television gantry perched on top. Until becoming a seated area, supporters could move freely between Compton Street and the Kop, resulting in the familiar half-time sight of fans flowing from the former to the latter for an improved view of the away goal. Cross Street End (away) Away fans were primarily housed in the Cross Street Terrace at one end of the ground, where 1,400 fans could be accommodated. This area was uncovered and open to the elements. This part of the ground also had work done on it in 2002. At the time of Saltergate's closure, the wall at the back of the terrace was the ground's oldest surviving feature, built by the council in return for the land needed to create Cross Street in 1921. To accommodate the new street, the pitch was moved around 6 metres closer to Saltergate as well as being levelled by more than a metre along its length. However, following this upheaval at the Cross Street End, the away terracing saw little change thereafter, though the original wooden crush barriers made way for metal ones around 1950. Football ground writer Simon Inglis described the Cross Street End in 1983 as \\"a low bank of terracing attractively backed by a castellated wall. Behind is a primary school... In the far corner is a group of turnstiles built by supporters in 1939 after [a] record attendance.\\" Records and statistics  Saltergate's record attendance was 30,561, which was set when Chesterfield hosted Tottenham Hostpur in the FA Cup 5th Round in February 1938. The widely held belief that the record attendance was set against Newcastle United in April 1939 is discredited by the Football League's audited attendance for that game, which stands at 28,268 - though this does represent the grounds's highest league attendance. According to the record books, a total of 3,159 first team matches were played at Saltergate, 1,827 of them league fixtures. Cricket and other uses Saltergate was also home to Chesterfield Cricket Club from 1871 to 1894. There are records of six cricket matches involving teams called Derbyshire or Chesterfield playing against the All-England Eleven from 1858 to 1872. The first four of these would have been held at Chesterfield Cricket Club's first Recreation Ground site, 100 yards closer to the town; however Chesterfield Cricket Club played a United South of England Eleven in September 1871 and an All-England Eleven in September 1872 after the move to the New Recreation Ground, Saltergate. Derbyshire County Cricket Club, founded in 1870, staged two first-class matches at Saltergate. The first was a county match versus Lancashire in August 1874, which was drawn after the final day was rained off. The other opponents were the United North of England Eleven in August 1875, which the UNEE won by 90 runs. First-class cricket returned to Chesterfield in 1898 when Derbyshire began playing at the Queen's Park ground which is still in use. This location has also been the home of Chesterfield Cricket Club since its departure from Saltergate. The stadium was also used on occasion to host rugby matches, concerts and community events. In the 2009 film The Damned United, Saltergate stood in for Wembley Stadium, Carrow Road, Bloomfield Road and most prominently, Derby County's Baseball Ground (demolished in 2003). The ground was chosen because it had not had any significant modifications since the 1970s, though some repainting work was done by the production team to differentiate the various locations represented. Saltergate's film role earnt the club added income of ¬£50,000 in 2007-08. References Category:Defunct football venues in England Category:Chesterfield F.C.

It has been the home ground of Leyton Orient since 1937, before which it was the home of amateur football team Leyton F.C., who moved to the Hare and Hounds ground. The highest attendance at the ground was 34,345 for the visit of West Ham United in the 1964 FA Cup. It has hosted a number of England U-16 and England women‚Äôs team matches. It hosted the 2007‚Äì08 FA Women's Premier League Cup final. It was also home of the Tottenham Hotspur Reserves. In 2012 Brisbane Road hosted the final of the inaugural NextGen series, a competition for the academy sides of elite clubs. History Brisbane Road has seen several developments in its history, but due to the second world war the first major improvement was the levelling of a grass bank and crash barrier installation in 1949. The terracing behind the goals was improved again in 1952, 1959 and 1960. In 1956 a small seated stand was dismantled and replaced with a stand from the decrepit Mitcham Stadium, which held 2,600 fans. In 1962, with Leyton Orient gaining promotion to the First Division, another wing was added to the main stand making the seating total 3,500. In 1978 the West Stand was converted into all-seating. In 1996 the terracing at the southern end of the ground was demolished, and used as a car park while Lottery funding to build a stand was (unsuccessfully) sought. The South Stand was eventually built in 1999, and was renamed The Tommy Johnston Stand on 5 September 2008. The ground is currently called the Breyer Group stadium for sponsorship reasons. In the past it was named after Leyton Orient's chairman at the time Barry Hearn's sports promotion company, Matchroom Sport, prior to which it was officially the Leyton Stadium, though fans still refer to it as Brisbane Road. The club registered an interest into moving into the Olympic Stadium following the 2012 Olympics, as the original plan was for this to have a capacity of about 25,000; however, the club's average attendance of about 5,000 meant that this was not a viable move. The eventual bids from both West Ham United and Tottenham Hotspur to move into the stadium, with capacity nearer 60,000, effectively ended Orient's interest. Brisbane Road is in very close proximity to both the Olympic Park and also Hackney Marshes. On 6 May 2012, Brisbane Road hosted a Super League game between London Broncos and Bradford Bulls due to works on the Broncos' home stadium Twickenham Stoop, with Bradford winning 22‚Äì29. Stands Justin Edinburgh Stand Capacity: 2,918 West Stand viewed from South Stand The Justin Edinburgh Stand is the new main stand at Brisbane Road and currently seats home supporters only. It has a capacity of 2,918, with 23 disabled supporters and their helpers. The letters L O F C are marked into the seats in black. It is also home to the club's offices, and the club shop and ticket office are at the back of this stand. There is also a row of executive seating (the Directors' Balcony) above the main seating which overhangs the rest of the stand, and the Olympic Suite which offers corporate hospitality. This stand also has premium seating (with its own bar) in its centre, known as the Gallery. It has two refreshment outlets at either end underneath the stand and it is accessed by turnstiles at either end via Oliver Road, or via the main reception for Gallery members and Olympic Suite diners. The players' changing rooms are also located underneath this stand and players emerge from the tunnel here. The dugouts are also located at the front of this stand after being moved from the opposite East Stand for the start of the 2006‚Äì07 season. The stand was renamed from the West Stand to the Justin Edinburgh Stand during Leyton Orient's match against Newport County on 25 January 2020. East Stand Capacity: 3,636 East Stand The East Stand, previously the main stand, is the oldest stand at Brisbane Road and is used by both home and away supporters. When an away team is allocated the entire stand for safety or other reasons, Orient fans in the North half of the stand are required to move elsewhere to accommodate the extra away fans. The capacity of the Northern end of this stand is 2,133 and the Southern end is 1,459. There are also executive seats in the middle of the stand (the old directors' box, now known as the Wyvern Suite) but these are not ordinarily used by any supporters. *East Stand North: 2,133 with 15 disabled supporters and their helpers *East Stand South (away): 1,459 with seven disabled supporters and their helpers The Qualiteach Community Stand Capacity: 1,381 The North Stand was completed for the start of the 2007‚Äì08 season and is currently used as a family stand.

The stand was sponsored by the CEO of Baskin Robbins, Nigel Travis, between 2012 and 2019. Travis, a lifelong Orient fan, purchased the club itself in 2017. Since the beginning of the 2019/20 Season the stand has been sponsored by Qualiteach, an education recruitment consultancy. https://www.leytonorient.com/2019/08/01/qualiteach-become-new- north-stand-sponsors/ Tommy Johnston South Stand Capacity: 1,336 This stand was built in 1999 and was formerly called the South Stand. It was renamed the 'Tommy Johnston Stand' in 2008 in memory of Leyton Orient's record goalscorer Tommy Johnston, but is currently referred to by the club as the Tommy Johnston South Stand. It is currently for home supporters only and has a capacity of 1,336. It has a refreshment outlet and a bar underneath the stand and is accessed through turnstiles from Buckingham Road.

Like many of Minter's other games, it has an offbeat sense of humour. The background music is based on the folk tune \\"Country Gardens\\" by Percy Grainger, arranged by James Lisney. Plot The purpose of the game is to mow the lawn (using the neighbour's mower) whilst avoiding static obstacles--the flowerbeds --and mobile enemies, including the neighbour himself.http://www.zzap64.co.uk/c64/hover.html The player's pet dog will antagonise the neighbour and keep him away, but as the dog itself is vulnerable to the mower, care must be taken not to run it over.  Gameplay  The lawnmower is controlled with the joystick. Completion of a level requires to mowing every square of grass on the screen. The mower moves slowly at first, but accelerates rapidly if the joystick is held in a single direction, encouraging the player to optimise a route to include as many long, straight lines as possible. The player is pursued by \\"the neighbour,\\" an antagonist who always moves directly towards the player. If caught by the neighbour, the player loses a credit, although this is represented as the neighbour taking the lawnmower away (it being, in fact, the neighbour's property) and the player having to borrow a mower from someone else. The player's credit remaining are indicated by the name of the neighbour from whom the current mower has been borrowed: Jim, Tom and finally Alf. As well as grass, the boards include blocking spaces through which the mower cannot be moved, and flowers. Mowing flowers results in a second antagonist, the gardener, appearing who pursues the player in the same way as the neighbour. Unlike the neighbour, the gardener will not walk over the existing flowerbeds. Moving the mower too fast results in the mower heat gauge rising; if it reaches maximum, the mower will stop moving until the gauge drops back to a particular level. It usually results in the player being caught by the neighbour or gardener. The player's only weapon is their dog. By hitting the fire button, the player can set the dog on the neighbour or gardener. This causes them to run away or freeze in place. The amount of time for which this can be done is limited (displayed as a Dog Loyalty meter). The dog also remains active, roaming randomly on the board even when not being used to attack. A Dog Tolerance meter slowly drops, representing a time limit. Once this reaches zero, the dog begins to attack the mower, causing an immediate overheat if he manages to bite it. If Dog Loyalty remains, the dog can be distracted from attacking the mower by commanding it to attack the neighbour or gardener instead. Also, if the mower collides with the dog, the Dog Tolerance meter immediately drops to zero. Legacy Windows port In 2002, Idigicon released a Microsoft Windows version under its Kool Dog label. It was not programmed by Jeff Minter. Mower acceleration was removed, and the player has 5 lives instead of 3.  Intellivision port In 2018, Elektronite released an Intellivision version. It was not programmed by Jeff Minter but rather by √ìscar Toledo Gutierrez. Sequel In 2002 Minter released a sequel, Hover Bovver 2, for the Windows and PocketPC platforms. This introduced new features: #The gardener's speed increases with the number of flowers mowed. If all flowers on the board were mowed, \\"the police\\" appear to chase the player--five extremely fast enemies who were immune to the dog. #Dog Tolerance drops much more slowly, and crashing into the dog with the mower no longer drops Dog Tolerance to zero. Instead, it causes \\"the vet\\" to appear, an enemy behaving as the others but immune to the dog's attacks. #The dog occasionally relieves itself on the lawn. The player can prevent this by spending Loyalty. If allowed to proceed, the resulting dog mess slows down the mower, but it also freezes any enemy colliding with it for a long period of time. #A \\"dog toy\\" can be collected which and thrown to the dog, increasing Loyalty and Tolerance at the cost of the player being unable to use the dog for a period of time. #Some levels feature a \\"weed killer\\" which if collected, gradually destroys all of the flowers on the level, leading to the gardener and police appearing. #Sheep gradually appear to assist in mowing the lawn by eating grass.

History Minebuster making up the chain lift hill, July 2007. Mighty Canadian Minebuster was one of five roller coasters to debut at the park's grand opening on May 23, 1981. It is also modeled after Shooting Star, a roller coaster that used to exist at Coney Island amusement park in Cincinnati, Ohio.

PTC stopped building coasters in 1979.Rutherford, Scott. The American Roller Coaster, MBI Publishing, 2000, p. 12 It is likely however, that the construction crew consisted of workers who had previously built coasters for PTC. The two, 30-passenger trains were supplied by the Philadelphia Toboggan Coasters. Canada's Wonderland's water park, Splash Works, has four sets of slides that pass over Minebuster. Ride layout Minebuster will be familiar to most coaster riders as a modified out and back wooden coaster, specifically with the addition of an upward spiraling helix at the end as the most obvious modification to the traditional out and back layout. The riders make an immediate U-turn to the left after leaving the station, past the storage depot and head up the chain lift hill. At the crest of the lift, the train makes a very small drop and turns right for the big drop. Riders then go through two negative-G hills and pass under a waterslide before climbing up a larger hill and making a turnaround to the right. The ride then drops down and rushes over three smaller hills before entering a banked turn to the left. For a finale, riders roar through a helix inside a tunnel before entering the brake run which stops the train.

It was the home ground of Rotherham County F.C. between 1907 and 1925 and then its successor Rotherham United F.C. until 2008. The stadium has had no professional tenant since, but has been in use again for local youth football since 2016. History The stadium was in use during the 1890s, with Rotherham Church Institute using the ground in the Sheffield Association League.Sheffield Independent, 15 November 1897 and presently has a capacity of around 8,300. During the 1990s, relocation to a new all-seater stadium in Rotherham was considered, but the original preferred site for a new stadium had become available by the time Rotherham won promotion to Division One in 2001, and were faced with the need to develop a new all-seater stadium at Millmoor or elsewhere. Initially, the club chose to convert Millmoor into an all-seater stadium. Redevelopment work was started on the ground, with a new main stand being built in place of the previous wooden main stand which was built in the 1950s. The new stand was planned to contain corporate facilities and bring the capacity back to over 10,000. The work was scheduled to finish in 2006, but has faced a series of setbacks, one of which was Japanese knotweed being found on the site. Rotherham United have now moved to a new community stadium. In May 2011 Rotherham Titans and Rotherham Council announced a plan to allow the rugby union club to move into Millmoor. After much speculation it was announced in December 2011 that the Titans would remain at Clifton Lane for the foreseeable future due to the deal falling through. Millmoor hosted a number of memorable Rotherham United games including a first leg of the inaugural Football League Cup final against Aston Villa in 1961, which Rotherham won 2‚Äì0. On 22 September 2007, for Rotherham United's game against Notts County, it was a special day to celebrate 100 years at Millmoor. The game ended 1-1, with Peter Holmes scoring for the Millers. There were special articles in the matchday programme and a commemorative cover. There were balloons all around Millmoor, with the Millers' badge, and the words '100 Years at Millmoor'. Fans were urged to wear retro Rotherham United shirts in order to be entered into a raffle. Many fans were seen with new scarves with Rotherham United F.C. on one side and 1907-2007 on the other side. In May 2008, Rotherham United were forced to leave Millmoor after talks with Ken Booth, owner of Millmoor, broke down. The team played at the Don Valley Stadium in Sheffield until 2012, when the club moved into a new community stadium back in Rotherham. Despite this, Millmoor remains in existence more than a decade after the football club's departure and has been used for other sports purposes. Structure and facilities  Tivoli End  The Tivoli was a favourite amongst the fans. The stand holds up to 2,700. It was a former terrace but was later seated during the club's time in the Football League Championship. Railway End Away terrace in 1976 The Railway End is the away fans section where over 2,000 fans can be accommodated. This end is covered and all seated. An unusual feature is that away fans can only access this end by going down Millmoor Lane, which is a narrow alleyway. The acoustics on the railway end are said to be some of the best and fans can generate a lot of noise. If needed, away fans can be given additional seats in a section of the Millmoor Lane stand. The railway referred to in the stand's name is the now closed line to the former Rotherham Westgate railway station. Main stand Stand under construction in 2005 Redevelopment work was started on this stand, however that work has now ceased and in November 2007 the club confirmed that it had no intentions to complete this stand or modernise any part of the stadium due to the difficulty in reaching a deal to purchase the land surrounding Millmoor from the previous chairman. This dispute later led to Rotherham United moving away from the stadium. The stand remains partly finished. Millmoor Lane End Opposite to the Main Stand is the Millmoor Lane side of the ground. It is split up into three sections: *Tivoli end/Uncovered end - before the ground was all-seated in conformity with the rules of the Football League Championship, the corner of the ground underneath the floodlights was a continuation of the terraces of the Tivoli End. When the section was all seated, the Tivoli End was split up into two parts for safety reasons: the part of the stand segregated from the Tivoli Stand is now simply called \\"The Uncovered End\\" due to the fact there is no roof over the heads of the home supporters housed there. *Millmoor Lane - in the middle of the Millmoor Lane side is the Millmoor Lane, which is a small stand for home supporters. Other uses Greyhound racing took place at Millmoor Stadium from 11 May 1931 until 29 July 1933. The racing was independent (not affiliated to the sports governing body the National Greyhound Racing Club) and was known as a flapping track which was the nickname given to independent tracks.

It is the biggest known Roman castellum in present-day Slovakia. It was a part of the Roman limes, the frontier-zone of the Empire.

The stadium, south of the town centre, is on the west side of the A523 London Road. The current capacity is 6,355. Football Ground Guide It was built in 1891, making it one of the oldest grounds in England. History Moss Rose first hosted Football League action when Chester City played home games at the stadium, between moving from Sealand Road to the Deva Stadium, from 1990 to 1992. The first such match was a 2-1 win for Exeter City on 1 September 1990. Later in the month, Arsenal played at Moss Rose in a Football League Cup tie, winning 1-0. Macclesfield were a non-league side at the time and fixtures were arranged so Chester were at home when Macclesfield were away and vice versa. The Moss Rose pitch was having to contend with more than 50 first-team matches a season from the two sides. Despite hosting Football League matches in this period, Macclesfield were denied entry to the Football League in 1995 after winning the Football Conference after the stadium requirements were tightened.BBC h2g2 The Football Conference A reciprocal offer by Chester to allow Macclesfield to play at the Deva Stadium while the necessary improvements were made was also rejected by the league. Macclesfield were champions again two years later, and the ground was now up to the required standards. Macclesfield beat Torquay United in their first home league match on 9 August 1997. Structure and facilities Alfred McAlpine Stand in 2006. The ground consists of four stands. The Silk FM stand (traditionally known as the London Road or Main stand) runs along the east side of the pitch. It is usually given over entirely to home supporters, unless the travelling support is particularly large, in which case the northern end houses some away fans. There is terracing along the entire length of the pitch, with a small stand at the back of the terracing. The Macclesfield Audi Stand (traditionally known as the Star Lane End) is to the left (south) of the Silk FM stand, and is used by the home support. On the west side is the Henshaw's Stand (originally known as the McAlpine stand, named after the contractor that built Huddersfield Town's Kirklees Stadium). This is all-seated and covered, and houses home supporters, and a small number of travelling fans. At the north end is the Silkmen Terrace, an open terrace for away fans. Unfortunately, as Macclesfield is often struck by wet weather, this can make for an uncomfortable spectating experience for visiting fans. There are plans to introduce some seating at the back of the Silkmen End and build a leisure complex and hotel behind it, but currently the finances required to do this do not exist. Sale After Macclesfield Town F.C. was wound up in September 2020, the stadium was listed for sale with offers invited in excess of ¬£500,000, roughly equivalent to the amount owed to the club's creditors.

Career   Brisbane  O'Bree spent two years with Brisbane, debuting in 1998 - but managed only 19 games in his 2 seasons. A ball winning midfielder, he won an AFL Rising Star nomination in the first week of 1999, having 27 touches. Leigh Matthews, coach of the Brisbane Lions, travelled to O'Bree's hometown of Ballarat during the off season in an attempt to persuade him to remain at Brisbane at the end of the 1999 season. Collingwood coach, Michael Malthouse, was very interested in O'Bree due to his brilliant display in his second AFL season. O'Bree left Brisbane by choice and Collingwood selected O'Bree with their first pick in the 2000 Pre-Season Draft.  Collingwood  O'Bree had a great first season with the club, showing dominance as a clearance player. He had 498 disposals and then 467 in successive seasons at Collingwood. O'Bree suffered a slow start to 2002 thanks to osteitis pubis, but played in both the 2002 Grand Final and the 2003 Grand Final, once again being a valuable clearance player in the centre. Around this time he also played his 100th game. Steady seasons in both 2004 and 2005 kept him going, despite his lack of speed in a slow midfield outfit, he still found the ball and tackled hard. 2006 saw him play all 23 games and bring up his 150th career game in round 5 against Port Adelaide. He consistently found the ball, having another good season in which he averaged 21 touches per game.  Coaching  After retiring as a player, he joined the Gold Coast Suns as a midfield assistant coach for their inaugural season in the AFL in 2011. At the end of the 2012 season, O'Bree moved back to Victoria and joined the Geelong Football Club as a midfield stoppage assistant coach.

It was shot in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California. The show was rerun as part of ABC's Sunday morning series. Plot Wonderbug's alter ego \\"Schlepcar\\" (so named due to its personalized California license plate \\"SCHLEP\\") was an old, beat up, conglomeration of several junked cars that looked like a rusty dune buggy. Like Herbie of Disney film fame, Schlepcar was alive and could drive itself, and could also talk in a mumbling voice. It was found in a junk yard by teenagers Barry Buntrock (David Levy), C.C. McNamara (John Anthony Bailey) and Susan Talbot (Carol Anne Seflinger). Schlepcar transformed into the shiny metal-flake orange Wonderbug whenever a magic horn (which played the bugle call for \\"cavalry charge\\") was sounded. In his Wonderbug identity, Schlepcar had the power of flight and was able to help the three teens capture crooks and prevent wrongdoing. In Wonderbug mode, the car was a Volkswagen-based Meyers Manx-clone body. Specifically the body was a Dune Runner manufactured by Dune Buggy Enterprises of Westminster, California. Dune Buggy Enterprises offered the Dune Runner with three different hood choices. Wonderbug has the T- Bird hood choice. The car had articulated eyeball headlights, and a custom bumper that resembled a mouth; different bumpers were sometimes used to give the car different facial expressions. When the car spoke in its mumbling voice, a rubber puppet stand-in with a moving mouth was sometimes used. The space that would normally contain the right rear passenger seat instead contained a box, described in dialog as \\"the costume/wardrobe trunk\\"; this box actually served to conceal a hidden driver in scenes in which the car drives itself. The car also had a long fender-mounted radio antenna that terminated with a robot-like claw or gripper. Its license plate would change to \\"1DERBUG\\". Barry often thought he was the brains of the outfit. However, it was usually Susan who came up with the ideas that saved them. A running gag was that Barry would suggest an outrageously implausible plan, its absurdity recognized by both C.C. and Susan. Susan would then suggest a far more sensible plan (usually involving disguises), which Barry would then suggest as if it were his own, prompting C.C. to praise Barry's supposed genius. Susan accepted the situation uncomplainingly, even telling a female character who observed one such exchange, \\"You get used to it.\\" Other appearances Wonderbug shared its half-hour time slot with other Krofft Supershow titles, including Magic Mongo, Bigfoot and Wildboy, Dr. Shrinker, The Lost Saucer, and Electra Woman and Dyna Girl.

Ancient and Early Medieval Chinese Literature (vol.3 & 4), p. 1483. BRILL, Leiden-Boston. E-.), personal name Xiao Gang (Ëï≠Á∂±), courtesy name Shizuan (‰∏ñÁ∫ò), nickname Liutong (ÂÖ≠ÈÄö), was an emperor of the Chinese Liang Dynasty. He was initially not the crown prince of his father Emperor Wu, the founder of the dynasty, but became the crown prince in 531 after his older brother Xiao Tong died. In 549, the rebellious general Hou Jing captured the capital Jiankang, and Hou subsequently held both Emperor Wu and Crown Prince Gang under his power, having Crown Prince Gang take the throne (as Emperor Jianwen) after Emperor Wu's death later that year. During Emperor Jianwen's reign, he was almost completely under Hou's control, and in 551, Hou, planning to take the throne himself, first forced Emperor Jianwen to yield the throne to his grandnephew Xiao Dong the Prince of Yuzhang, and then sent messengers to suffocate the former emperor.  Background  Xiao Gang was born in 503, as the third son of Emperor Wu. His mother Consort Ding Lingguang () also gave birth to Emperor Wu's firstborn son and crown prince Xiao Tong, and therefore carried a special status within his palace even though she was never empress. In 506, at the age of three, Xiao Gang was made the Prince of Jin'an. As he grew in age, he was given a number of progressively higher offices. In 526, when Consort Ding died, he resigned those offices to observe a mourning period for her, but Emperor Wu restored him to those offices before the mourning period was over. Consort Ding's death would bring about a disastrous effect in the relationship between Xiao Gang's father Emperor Wu and Xiao Gang's brother Xiao Tong. Xiao Tong sought out an appropriate place to bury Consort Ding, but while he was doing so, a land owner bribed the eunuch Yu Sanfu () into convincing Emperor Wu that that piece of land would bring good fortune for the emperor, and so Emperor Wu bought the land and buried Consort Ding there. However, once Consort Ding was buried, a Taoist monk informed Xiao Tong that he believed that the land would bring ill fortune for Consort Ding's oldest son‚ÄîXiao Tong. Xiao Tong therefore allowed the monk to bury a few items intended to dissolve the ill fortune, such as wax ducks, at the position reserved for the oldest son. Later on, when one of Xiao Tong's attendants, Bao Miaozhi (), was squeezed out of Xiao Tong's inner circles by another attendant, Wei Ya (), he, in resentment, reported to Emperor Wu that Wei had carried out sorcery on Xiao Tong's behalf. When Emperor Wu investigated, waxed ducks were found, and Emperor Wu became surprised and angry, and wanted to investigate further. He only stopped the investigation when he was advised to do so by the prime minister Xu Mian, executing only the Taoist monk who had suggested the burial of wax ducks. Xiao Tong became humiliated in the affair, and was never able to clear himself completely in his father's eyes. Xiao Tong died in 531. Under Confucian rules of succession, his oldest son Xiao Huan () the Duke of Huarong was expected to succeed him as crown prince, and Emperor Wu summoned Xiao Huan back to the capital Jiankang in order to do so. However, still resentful over the wax duck affair, he hesitated for days without carrying out the creation, and finally did not do so. Instead, against popular opinion, he installed Xiao Gang, his then-surviving oldest son, as crown prince. Xiao Gang's staff advisor Zhou Hongzheng () wrote a memo to Xiao Gang advising him to decline, but Xiao Gang did not do so, although he subsequently avenged Xiao Tong's disgrace by executing Bao Miaozhi.  As crown prince  As crown prince, Xiao Gang was a distinguished poet, as well as patron of the poets Liu Zun and Xu Li (), as well as Xu Ling, the anthologist of New Songs from the Jade Terrace. The poem \\"Multitudinous Blossoms\\" by Liu Zun describes the luxurious but ultimately pitiful life of a professional male prostitute.Hinsch, Bret. (1990). Passions of the Cut Sleeve. University of California Press. pp. 72-73. One of the crown prince's own poems describes a languid life of lolling on an ivory inlaid bed, surrounded by feather curtains, with a male lover. Given his own writing, some have asserted that Xiao Gang was homosexual. Others have pointed to the numerous children claimed by him later in life as evidence of heterosexuality. There is no way to prove either assertion, and the notion of a powerful man pointedly limiting himself to one gender or the other would in fact have been alien in a culture where class hierarchy affected male sex lives far more than the genders of their partners.Hinsch, Bret. (1990). Passions of the Cut Sleeve. University of California Press. p. 10 The poet Xu's writing style became known as \\"palace style\\", and initially, Emperor Wu was displeased about this development, but once Emperor Wu met Xu, he was impressed by Xu's talents, and became a patron of Xu himself as well. It is unclear whether Xiao Gang carried out much decision-making duties in the imperial administration, as Xiao Tong did before his death. As Emperor Wu aged, Xiao Gang's younger brothers Xiao Xu () the Prince of Luling, Xiao Guan () the Prince of Shaoling, Xiao Yi the Prince of Xiangdong, and Xiao Ji the Prince of Wuling grew less obedient of his edicts, and effectively exercised imperial powers in their provincial domains. Fearing that his brothers would seize power, Xiao Gang selected elite troops to be the palace guards for the crown prince's palace. He honored Taoist philosophies, and often lectured on the Tao Te Ching and the Zhuangzi. In 547, the Eastern Wei general Hou Jing, in a conflict with the new regent Gao Cheng, surrendered the 13 provinces (the region between the Yellow River and the Huai River) to Liang, seeking aid from Liang. However, both Xiao Gang's cousin Xiao Yuanming the Marquess of Zhenyang, and Hou himself, were defeated by the Eastern Wei general Murong Shaozong (). Xiao Yuanming was captured, while Hou fled and, surprising the Liang governor of Southern Yu Province (ÂçóË±´Â∑û, modern central Anhui), Wei An (), seized the key city Shouyang (Â£ΩÈôΩ, in modern Lu'an, Anhui), the capital of Southern Yu Province. Instead of punishing Hou, however, Emperor Wu allowed him to serve as the governor of Southern Yu Province. It is unclear whether Xiao Gang was involved in making these decisions, but he was clearly informed about them, as he revealed these decisions to his assistant He Jingrong (). Soon, however, Hou, believing that Emperor Wu, who engaged in peace talks with Eastern Wei and appeared to be willing to betray him to exchange for Xiao Yuanming, rebelled in summer 548. Hou's army quickly advanced on Jiankang, assisted by Xiao Gang's cousin Xiao Zhengde the Prince of Linhe, putting Jiankang under siege. Emperor Wu put Xiao Gang in charge of the defenses, but Xiao Gang was unsuccessful in preventing the outer city from falling. The imperial troops were forced to withdraw into the palace. When Hou then claimed that it was the corrupt official Zhu Yi that he wanted to kill, Xiao Gang confirmed that Zhu was indeed corrupt, but advised against executing Zhu in that it would serve nothing in the campaign against Hou. Soon, Hou declared Xiao Zhengde emperor. While provincial troops gathered near Jiankang to try to relieve the besieged palace, those troops, commanded by Liu Zhongli () and Xiao Guan, were unsuccessful, and ultimately, after Liu was nearly killed in a battle, Liu refused to engage Hou any further, leaving the palace troops to fend for themselves. (Xiao Yi and Xiao Ji, although they each had large numbers of troops in their domains, largely stood and sent only token troops.) In winter 548, Hou's general Fan Taobang () offered to rebel against Hou, and while Emperor Wu was initially in favor of the idea, Xiao Gang spoke against it, and it was not carried out. Soon, Fan was killed by Hou, and an opportunity was lost. In spring 549, Xiao Gang tried to negotiate peace with Hou, whose troops had by then tired. Hou initially agreed‚Äîwith the terms being that he would be given the provinces west of the Yangtze River. However, Hou soon reneged on the peace agreement and resumed the siege of the palace. Soon, the palace fell, and Emperor Wu and Xiao Gang were effectively taken as hostages, although Hou continued to formally honor them as emperor and crown prince, despite his earlier agreement with Xiao Zhengde to have them killed. (Hou soon deposed Xiao Zhengde and killed him.) Xiao Gang's attendants all fled, except for Xu Li and Yin Buhai (). The provincial troops which had come to Jiankang's aid were disbanded, and Hou was now in control of the capital region. Meanwhile, Emperor Wu, while he was under Hou's control, was unwilling to yield, and he refused to carry out some of the acts that Hou wanted him to. Xiao Gang tried to urge Emperor Wu to follow Hou's requests, but Emperor Wu refused. Hou put Emperor Wu under closer guard, and Emperor Wu, in anger, soon grew ill and died. (Some historians believe that Hou starved Emperor Wu to death.) Xiao Gang did not dare to weep for Emperor Wu's death, and Hou made him emperor to succeed Emperor Wu (as Emperor Jianwen).  As emperor  Emperor Jianwen was formally recognized by the governors of the provinces not under Hou's control, but they saw his edicts as coerced and not binding on them, and they continued to resist Hou, and yet at the same time fought each other for territorial control and were largely ineffective when Hou attacked them, allowing Hou to seize additional territory. Eastern Wei (and its successor state Northern Qi, established in 550 as Gao Cheng's brother Gao Yang seized the throne from Emperor Xiaojing) largely seized the Liang provinces north of the Yangtze. Emperor Jianwen himself tried to foster a relationship with Hou, to ensure his own safety, and in 550, he married his daughter the Princess Liyang to Hou as Hou's wife. Hou favored the princess greatly, and for the time being, the emperor appeared safe. He created his oldest son Xiao Daqi crown prince. However, Hou still kept the emperor under heavy guard, and only several officials, including his cousin Xiao Zi () the Marquess of Wulin, Wang Ke (), and Yin Buhai were allowed to see him. Meanwhile, most of the provincial governors eventually accepted the command of Emperor Jianwen's brother Xiao Yi the Prince of Xiangdong, the governor of Jing Province (ËçäÂ∑û, modern western Hubei). In summer 550, Hou sent his general Ren Yue () to try to conquer the central empire. Ren first defeated and captured Emperor Jianwen's son Xiao Daxin () the Prince of Xunyang and governor of Jiang Province (Ê±üÂ∑û, modern central and northern Jiangxi), and then continued on to try to attack Xiao Yi's territory. When Ren was unable to prevail against Xiao Yi's general Xu Wensheng (), and Hou himself commanded a force to aid Ren. In winter 550, while Hou was away from Jiankang, Emperor Jianwen's nephew Xiao Huili () plotted with his brother Xiao Aili (), the general Liu Jingli (), and Emperor Jianwen's cousins Xiao Quan () the Marquess of Xixiang and Xiao Mian () the Marquess of Dongxiang, to start a rebellion at Jiankang and overthrow Hou Jing's lieutenant Wang Wei. The plot was discovered, however, and Xiao Huili and his coconspirators were executed by Wang. While Wang could not show that Emperor Jianwen was involved, Hou and Wang became even more suspicious of Emperor Jianwen thereafter. In fear, Wang Ke and Yin stopped seeing the emperor, but Xiao Zi continued. In response, Hou had Xiao Zi assassinated. Emperor Jianwen believed that eventually he would be killed as well, and he commented as such to Yin.  Removal and death  In summer 551, Hou was again aiding Ren, taking Xiao Daqi with him as hostage. Initially, with Hou backing him, Ren took the important city of Jiangxia (Ê±üÂ§è, in modern Wuhan, Hubei), and Hou next approached Xiao Yi's headquarters at Jiangling (Ê±üÈôµ, in modern Jingzhou, Hubei). However, Hou's forces then became bogged down while trying to siege Baling (Â∑¥Èôµ, in modern Yueyang, Hunan), with Xiao Yi's general Wang Sengbian successfully defending Baling. Soon, Hou's food supplies ran out, and his forces collapsed. Ren was captured, and two other key generals, Song Zixian () and Ding He () were killed. Hou fled back to Jiankang. Hou, believing that his days of power might be numbered, wanted to become emperor. Meanwhile, Wang had disputes with Emperor Jianwen's daughter Princess Liyang, and believing that she would eventually harm him, persuaded Hou that he should remove the emperor to show off his power. In fall 551, Hou deposed Emperor Jianwen and demoted him back to the title of Prince of Jin'an, and made Xiao Huan's son Xiao Dong the Prince of Yuzhang emperor. Hou had all of Emperor Jianwen's sons who were under his control, including Xiao Daqi the Crown Prince, executed. (He soon regretted these actions, and considered restoring Emperor Jianwen to the throne and making Xiao Dong crown prince, but Wang persuaded him not to do so.) He put Emperor Jianwen under house arrest. During the house arrest period, Emperor Jianwen, filled with sadness and fear, wrote several hundred poems‚Äîand because he was not given paper to write on, wrote the poems on the walls and screens of his residence. Less than two months after Emperor Jianwen's removal, Wang persuaded Hou that Emperor Jianwen must be removed, and Hou sent Wang, Peng Jun (), and Wang Xiuzuan () to visit Emperor Jianwen one night. Emperor Jianwen, knowing what their intentions were, feasted and drank with them, becoming very intoxicated. Once he fell asleep, they suffocated him, and then placed him in a makeshift casket, storing the casket in a brewery. In 552, after Wang Sengbian captured Jiankang, he had Emperor Jianwen's casket placed in the palace and then buried with imperial honors.

The red area indicates area codes 410, 443, and 667. Area codes 410, 443, and 667 are telephone area codes serving the eastern half of the U.S. state of Maryland, including the Baltimore metropolitan area and the Eastern Shore. The 410 area code is the original area code, while the 443 and 667 codes are overlay codes. 443 and 667 were primarily used with cell phones and CLEC carriers such as Comcast or Cavalier Telephone when introduced but have since become universal in their carrier availability. History Before these area codes were created, all of Maryland had been served by 301 since the institution of area codes in 1947, even though the state is home to two very large metropolitan areas‚ÄîBaltimore and the Maryland suburbs of Washington, D.C. (area code 202). This made Maryland one of the most-populous states to be served by a single area code. However, by the late 1980s, 301 was on the verge of exhaustion due to the rapid growth of the Baltimore and Washington suburbs, as well as the proliferation of fax machines and pagers. The number shortage problem was exacerbated by the use of 202 as a de facto overlay for the entire Washington metro area. Every number assigned on the Maryland side of the metro, as well as in northern Virginia's area code 703, was given a \\"hidden\\" number in 202, making it possible to complete a call within the metro area with only seven digits. One consequence of this was that a central office prefix could not be duplicated anywhere in the Washington area. Thus, if a 202-574 number was in use in the District or a 703-574 number was in use in northern Virginia, the corresponding 301-574 number could only be assigned to an area considered a safe distance from Washington, such as but not limited to in the Eastern Shore. The partial overlay ended in 1990, but it soon became apparent that this would not free up enough numbers to meet demand. By the fall of 1990, it was apparent that there was no way to stave off the immediate need for a new area code in Maryland. In November 1990, a plan to add a second area code to the state was announced. It was decided that the Baltimore metropolitan area and the Eastern Shore would get the new area code, area code 410, while western and southern Maryland‚Äîincluding the Washington suburbs‚Äîwould remain with the 301 area code.\\"New area code coming\\". The Baltimore Sun. November 21, 1990. p. E6. The western half of the state retained 301 because the bulk of Maryland's population resides in the Washington suburbs. On the other side of the Potomac River, many of the same factors resulted in most of the old 703 territory outside of Northern Virginia split off as area code 540 in 1995. Area code 410 officially entered service on October 6, 1991; it was initially implemented in permissive-dialing mode, not as a flash-cut, with the 10-digit dialing scheme coming in for local calls across the new 301/410 boundary. The split largely followed metro lines. However, parts of Anne Arundel, Carroll, Frederick, and Howard counties were split between area codes 301 and 410.\\"New area code for eastern Maryland\\". The Baltimore Sun. November 1, 1991. p. 1A. Effective November 1, 1991, ten-digit dialing was required when calling a different area code in Maryland.\\"Now Area Codes Count in Md.\\" The Washington Post. November 2, 1992. p. B9. Although the split was intended to be a long- term solution, within five years 410 was already close to exhaustion due to the proliferation of cell phones and pagers, particularly in and around Baltimore. To solve this problem, area code 443 was overlaid onto the 410 territory on July 1, 1997. Overlays were a new concept at the time, and had met resistance because of the requirement for ten-digit dialing. Conventional wisdom would have called for a split in which Baltimore retained 410, with the Eastern Shore switching to 443. However, even with 410 on the verge of exhaustion, the Eastern Shore was not deemed large enough for implementing a separate numbering plan area. Additionally, Bell Atlantic (now Verizon), the largest telephone provider in the region, wanted to spare Eastern Shore residents the expense and burden of changing their numbers for the second time in a decade. By 2011, the 410/443 area was once again running out of numbers because of the continued proliferation of cell phones.

It is the oldest football stadium in Ireland, and the home ground of Ireland's oldest football club, Cliftonville. The stadium holds 6,224, but is currently restricted to 2,530 under safety legislation. The stadium was built in 1890 and has undergone several renovations. In 2002, a new stand was built at one end of the ground to house visiting supporters, and in 2008, a new stand was completed behind the goal at the east end of the ground. A synthetic 3G pitch was installed to replace the previous grass surface in 2010.  History  Solitude was opened in 1890 after Cliftonville moved across the road from Oldpark Avenue. The ground holds the distinction of having the first ever penalty in International Football taken there. Previously consisting of two pitches (the second of which was sold off and now contains housing), Solitude is the oldest football ground in Ireland. Solitude has hosted a number of cup finals and international games. During the 1890s and early 1900s Solitude was the home ground of Ireland, replacing the Ulster Cricket Ground at Ballynafeigh. During the 1890s, the ground hosted 11 home internationals. On 3 March 1894, after thirteen attempts Ireland, playing at Solitude, finally avoided defeat to England. Against an England team that included Fred Spiksley and Jack Reynolds, Ireland gained a 2‚Äì2 draw. Goals from Olphert Stanfield and W.K. Gibson inspired Ireland to come back from 2‚Äì0 down to gain a 2‚Äì2 draw. The ground continued to host Ireland internationals into the early 1900s, but was gradually replaced as Ireland‚Äôs home ground by Windsor Park and Dalymount Park.  Stands   Main stand  The Main Stand, January 2019 The main stand at Solitude, situated on the western side of the ground, houses the majority of the Cliftonville support on any given home matchday. It was constructed during the 1950s, and has two tiers. The lower tier is terracing, and the upper tier has a mixture of seating and benches, and holds over 2,500 people. The original stand was destroyed in January 1949 when a fire broke out after a Linfield v Glentoran Irish Cup tie at the ground. The match was staged at Solitude as Linfield's Windsor Park had been closed for a month in the aftermath of the infamous 1948 Linfield v Belfast Celtic Boxing Day tie at which serious crowd trouble erupted and Celtic striker Jimmy Jones was badly beaten by spectators. Also contained within the main stand at Solitude, is Cliftonville Social Club: Cliftonville's licensed premises. God knows when the main stand will be demolished to make way for a new main stand which will look similar to the new south stand at Crusaders ground Seaview. This will hold an estimated 1100 supporters along with underground parking and bring Solitude's seated capacity up to around 3500.  Cage End stand  The Cage Stand In many peoples' opinion this most famous part of the old ground. The Cage was demolished and a new stand seating 1600 was opened on 27 October 2008. New facilities under this stand have replaced facilities such as new dressing rooms. Floodlights  Away End  TheAway End Often referred to as \\"The Bowling Green End\\" (due to the bowling green behind it), the away end on the north side of the ground underwent a major facelift in 2001, when the covered terracing used to house away fans was replaced by an 880 all-seated stand.  Whitehouse  The Whitehouse, not unlike \\"the Cottage\\" at Fulham's ground Craven Cottage, currently contains the changing facilities and the board room for the club. However the building of the new stand in place of the Cage is expected to relieve the Whitehouse of these duties. Some have suggested that this historic part of Irish football will be preserved in the form of a museum. As part of the new main stand the Whitehouse will be demolished to make for a club shop, museum, bar and function room as well as serving as an entrance to new main stand and the underground car park that will ease traffic chaos in the small streets behind the main stand on match day. Waterworks Stand The Waterworks Stand was temporarily erected first for a UEFA Champions League game against Scottish Champions Celtic. Once the Main Stand is rebuilt future plans could see Sport NI, NIFL and IFA give funds to Cliftonville to make a stand on that side that will look a bit like Windsor Park's North Stand to house the Cliftonville and Away fans at big games to help rebrand the Irish League under NIFL. While the Red's attendances have doubled since 2008/09 from 700 to 1400 they would need to further increase considerably for the Waterworks stand to be viable as after the completion of the Main Stand capacity will be 3500.

Popular Electronics magazine wanted a feature article on an intelligent computer terminal and Technical Editor Les Solomon asked Marsh and Lee Felsenstein to design one. It was featured on the July 1976 cover and became the Sol-20 Personal Computer. The first units were shipped in December 1976 and the Sol-20 was a very successful product.Veit (1993), 131-148 The company failed to develop next generation products and ceased operations in May 1979.Freiberger (2000), 153-155 History Bob Marsh, Lee Felsenstein and Gordon French started designing the Sol-20 between April and July 1975. The Sol-20 utilized the Intel 8080 8-bit microprocessor chip, running at 2 MHz. A major difference between the Sol-20 and most other machines of the era was its built-in video driver, which allowed it to be attached to a composite monitor for display. The Sol-20 consisted of a main motherboard (PCB) mounted at the bottom of the case, and a five slot S-100 bus card cage. The main PCB consisted of the CPU, memory, video display, I/O circuits. Inside the case included power supply, fan, and keyboard. The case was painted 'IBM blue' and the sides of the case were made of solid oiled walnut originally salvaged from a gun stock manufacturer. Processor Technology manufactured approximately 10,000 Sol-20 personal computers between 1977 and 1979. All Processor Technology products were available either fully assembled, or as electronic kits. Processor Technology also sold software on Compact Cassette. One side of the tape was recorded in CUTS format, and the other side was Kansas City standard format. Gary Ingram and Steven Dompier wrote the original software utilities. Lee Felsenstein wrote the original user manuals as a contractor. Standards Processor Technology also designed several S-100 bus boards. The boards were meant to be compatible with the circuits of Sol-20. The Video Display Module 1 (VDM-1) was the original video display interface for S-100 bus systems. Processor Technology advertisement. The VDM-1 Video Display Module for the Altair computer generated 16 lines of 64 characters on a black and white TV. Kit price was $160, assembled $225. The Cromemco TV Dazzler first appeared in the April 1976 issue of Byte The board generates sixteen 64-character lines of upper and lower case typeface on any standard composite video monitor or a modified TV set. Utilizing a 1,024 byte (1K) segment of system memory, the VDM-1 provided memory-mapped I/O for high performance, and also included hardware support for scrolling. The VDM-1 Video Board was a great improvement over using a teletype machine or a serial attached terminals, and was popular for owners of other S-100 bus systems such as the IMSAI 8080. Another popular product was the CUTS Tape I/O Interface S-100 board. The CUTS board offered standard interface for saving and reading data from cassette tape, supporting both the Kansas City standard format, as well as their own custom CUTS format.

At one time the stadium was capable of accommodating almost 50,000 spectators, however in its final years it had an all-seated capacity of 10,800. Until its closure in 2009, it was the home ground of St Mirren F.C.. The football grounds on Love Street were registered as Fullerton Park for St Mirren's first season there as they were originally rented from a Mr Fullerton. The ground's record attendance was 47,438 for a match against Celtic in 1949. St Mirren completed construction of their new St Mirren Park in December 2008. St Mirren played their last game at Love Street, against Motherwell, on 3 January 2009. Early years at Love Street When St Mirren began to play on Love Street in the mid-1890s football clubs were still very much in their infancy and moved from ground to ground renting from local landowners. The best deal available was commonly a ten-year lease and by the time St Mirren arrived at Love Street, the club was only 17 years old and playing on its fifth rented ground. They had previously played on four sites in the north of Paisley; Shortroods Estate (1877 to 1878), Abingdon Park (1878 to 1879), Thistle Park, Greenhill Road (1879 to 1882), and Westmarch Estate, Greenhill Road (1882 to 1894). Paisley clubs Abercorn, who played at Underwood Park, and St Mirren joined the Scottish Football League when it started in 1890‚Äì91. Old Main Stand Following twelve years playing at Westmarch, St Mirren moved in 1894 in response to a 100% rent increase by the landlord who appeared to have lost interest in hosting football on his land. The club found a former brickworks at the foot of Love Street which could be rented for an initial ten years on reasonable terms. The land at Westmarch had been laid out with two pitches, a grandstand and pavilion; the Love Street site was substantially smaller, barely wide enough to lay a football pitch with some spare ground behind the goals; it was poorly drained and without grass. However, it would give St Mirren the significant advantage of being nearer to Paisley town centre than any of the other football clubs in the town. Furthermore, the site was already well known to the townsfolk as an entertainment venue, as it was where travelling circuses set up their Big Top. The original Love Street site housed the re-built club pavilion behind the Love Street end goal, and a new grandstand, squeezed along the full length of the pitch with five rows of seats and a total capacity of 1,000. St Mirren played their first home game at Love Street, a 3‚Äì0 defeat to Celtic, on 8 September 1894. Shortly after the original ten-year lease ran out, the club was almost forced to move away from Love Street, much as it had already been from Westmarch. With the club approaching Mr Fullerton with an offer to buy the site, the landowner tried to take advantage of the situation by setting a lofty price, together with an ultimatum to either buy or face a hefty increase in rent. The club hastily looked for alternatives, and began negotiations with the owners of the Shortroods Estate where St Mirren had played for its first season. However, with the prospect of losing out altogether, Mr Fullerton backed down, reducing his asking price to ¬£3,900 and thus Saints purchased and stayed at Love Street. Over the course of the next fifteen years the club‚Äôs aim was to expand the site by buying the land that bordered on two sides ‚Äì towards the town and round onto Greenock Road. However, it was not until 1920 that the land was finally secured and St Mirren owned pretty much the site that it occupied through to its closure. Development of Love Street With a large site now owned, and the football pitch about to be moved 40 yards towards the town, the club had plans in 1921 for a 60,000 capacity ground with a large oval sweep of earth embankments on three sides, with the fourth side taken up by a 4,500 seater grandstand set up above a 3,000 capacity terraced enclosure, with a 440-yard running track round the pitch. However, before building began, the Great Depression in the United Kingdom tightened its grip and costs more than doubled in the space of six months. The part of the project to suffer most was the grandstand as the final price of the stadium rose from an estimate of ¬£17,500, for the full plans, to around ¬£30,000 for the scaled-down version that was completed six months later. The grandstand was reduced in size by almost two-thirds with the steel framework clad in corrugated sheeting to further reduce costs. The St Mirren Directors' intention was to eventually complete the original plans for a full-length grandstand on Love Street in stages as funds permitted, however this did not materialise. After 1921 there were no major changes to the grounds until the late 1950s when the North Bank was covered and floodlights installed. Twenty years later new floodlight pylons were installed and plans appeared for redeveloping St Mirren Park as an all-seater stadium. There was also talk of incorporating airport car-parking, or a hotel, or commercial office space. Love Street became a designated ground under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act in 1977, which prompted the local government to demand alterations. In the summer of 1979, the Love Street End terracing was knocked down and rebuilt ten yards from the goal. There was more talk of covering the new family enclosure at Cairter‚Äôs Corner and installing a stadium clock and even one suggestion to re-locate in Renfrew District Council‚Äôs proposed ¬£200 million national stadium planned for a site across the railway line from Greenhill Road. With the Scottish Football Association (SFA) preferring to redevelop Hampden Park, St Mirren remained at Love Street and seats were installed on the North Bank terrace in 1991. Four years later, after the owner of a large building company had joined the club's board of directors, the 3,015 seat Caledonia Stand was built in a deal that saw some of the club‚Äôs land sold for development as housing. There were also plans to have a similar stand built at the Love Street End but the bottom fell out of the construction industry and there was the near closure of St Mirren in 1998. St Mirren won the 1999‚Äì2000 Scottish First Division and were promoted to the Scottish Premier League (SPL) as First Division champions. In order to meet SPL regulations in their first season in the top flight, the club had to carry out further work on the stadium, installing seating on the Love Street terrace. The stands At the time of the stadium closing, the 1921 main stand remained situated on the southern (town) side of the stadium. The largest stand was the West Stand (Caledonia Street), which housed away fans. The North Bank stand was sponsored by former shirt-sponsors LDV and was where the most vocal home fans usually sat. The most recently built stand, the East Stand, or Reid Kerr College Stand, was on the Love Street side of the stadium and became used as the home support's Family Stand . Floodlights In the 1950s the club had a unique problem when it came to installing floodlights at Love Street. The ground was on the direct approach path for aircraft to the local airport which, at that time, was a mere three miles east, in Renfrew. This meant that as well as involving Paisley Town Council, Saints‚Äô plans also had to satisfy three Government departments - the Ministry of Civil Aviation, the Air Ministry and The Admiralty. Initially there were roof-line lights set all the way along the newly built North Bank cover and the grandstand opposite. But, because the stand was considerably shorter than full-length there also had to be two pylons built to light the corners of the pitch on the stand side. And these could not be very tall because of the flight-path. They ended up therefore as two, strangely squat-looking, 40-foot pylons that weren‚Äôt even as tall as the stand roof and had three rows of lights topped by a reflector shield. These pylons had originally been used at either end of the covered terracing at Ibrox Stadium and came to Love Street as part of the transfer negotiations that took central defender Willie Telfer to Rangers. Nonetheless, there still came complaints from pilots that the pylon to the right of the stand was confusing their approach and a black-out order was imposed whilst aviation charts had this new landmark added. It then took a further eight months for the Air Ministry to run tests and finally pass the system fit for use. The first match under the floodlights was on 13 February 1959 against Peebles Rovers in the Scottish Cup, a match St Mirren won 10‚Äì0. In 1966 the airport was moved to less than a mile north of St Mirren Park and its current site in Abbotsinch, Paisley; later becoming known as Glasgow International Airport. Almost immediately the club was being asked by the media when they would install \\"proper\\" floodlights, as the system was not highly regarded. Club finances at the time were extremely tight, with only two full-time employees, and so there was no possibility that money could be spent on improving the floodlights. It took until 1978, with a new set of Directors at the helm and a Development Fund put in motion that 90-foot high pylons were erected. Under-soil heating One of the criteria for admittance to the SPL, following promotion in the 2005‚Äì06 season, was that the pitch was equipped with under-soil heating. As the club was already planning to move to a new site, it was faced with installing an expensive heating system that might only be used for one season, a financial burden they would struggle to meet. The Directors considered requesting a period of grace from the SPL, but in the end decided to go ahead with installing the system. Move to new stadium On 16 August 2005 the Scottish Executive and Renfrewshire Council granted permission for the club to sell Love Street for supermarket development and allow the club to build a new stadium in Greenhill Road, Ferguslie Park, Paisley. The sale of their old ground financed the new stadium and cleared the financial debts of the club. In April 2007 it was announced that a deal had been struck with Tesco. Under this deal Tesco would pay for the construction of the new St Mirren Park, an 8,000 seat stadium. Work on the new ground started on 9 January 2008. The last match to be played at Love Street, a goalless draw between St Mirren and Motherwell, took place before a sell-out crowd on 3 January 2009. The club officially moved into the new St Mirren Park on Wednesday 21 January 2009. The local authorities subsequently refused planning permission for a supermarket on the Love Street site. As of February 2012, it is planned to be used for housing. Attendance records St Mirren played in five Scottish Cup semi-finals at home on the original Love Street Grounds. Crowds regularly reached 10,000 and peaked at 16,000 for the 1906 semi-final clash with Third Lanark. Following the ground's redevelopment, a visit of Rangers in the 1923‚Äì24 Scottish Cup took the ground attendance record above 40,000 for the first time and twelve months later Celtic came to Love Street and the attendance record rose to 47,428. During the post-World War II boom in attendances, the record was broken again on 20 August 1949 with another visit by Celtic, this time in a Scottish League Cup match in front of a crowd of 47,438. Once the Love Street End had been squared off, the capacity fell and the largest crowd was another visit of Celtic in the 1979‚Äì80 Scottish Cup fourth round replay when 27,166 squeezed inside, leaving huge queues on Love Street locked out. At the time of closure, the all-seated capacity was 10,800. The highest attendance under that capacity was 10,261 for an SPL game against Dunfermline Athletic. Other football matches at Love Street St Mirren hosted a women's football match at Love Street in 1895. The ground has been a regular venue for schoolboy internationals, Scottish Junior Cup semi-finals, and Scotland Under-21 internationals. In 1904 the Scottish Football League played the Irish Football League in front of 10,000 fans. In 1923, 25,000 fans watched Scotland played Wales in the British Home Championship. Local rivals Morton played their home games at Love Street for part of 1949. The deal was that St Mirren got to keep the stand and enclosure takings from the games. Morton also played a Scottish Cup tie against Rangers at Love Street in 2000. In 1970, it was used as a venue for one match in the UEFA European Under-19 Football Championship hosted by Scotland.

It is known that there was a Scottish Inter-Region rugby union match played there in 1897 and at least one dog handicap race run around the track in the early years of the 20th century. St Mirren tried to introduce greyhound racing on a regular basis in the early 1930s, and spent money on upgrading the track. The first meeting was held on 14 October 1932 and the track was independent (unlicensed). However, only three weeks after the first race the SFA declared a ban on greyhound racing at football grounds and the club lost money on the venture. When the ban was lifted, and St Mirren was approached to resume racing, the club declined. In 1938, a World Title Flyweight boxing match was scheduled to take place at the stadium involving Scotland‚Äôs first-ever world champion boxer Benny Lynch. Again money was spent with an anticipated pay-back from a 30,000 crowd. The event turned sour when Lynch was stripped of his title in the days before the fight for failing by a large margin to make the weight. It went ahead as a non-title bout but Lynch‚Äôs fans felt badly let down and the turnout was poor. Paisley Lions speedway team raced in the British National Speedway League at Love Street for two seasons in 1975 and 1976. The first meeting was held on 5 April 1975 in front of a crowd of over 6,000. However, despite the meetings being well attended the club folded after two seasons. Their last meeting was held on 25 September 1976 when the Lions beat Boston Barracudas 52-25.

Life He was born in Aiskew, Bedale, Yorkshire and showed athletic aptitude as a high and long jumper and as a cricketer. His cricket was greatly improved by the visit to Bedale of the eminent bowler William Clarke in 1848. He was employed as a clerk in his youth before making cricket his profession in early manhood. Anderson appeared at Lord's in 1851, when he played for the North against the South, and for the Players against the Gentlemen in 1855. From 1857 until 1864 he was a member of the All England XIs captained by William Clarke, and George Parr. He visited Australia with Parr's team travelling onboard the SS Great Britainhttps://globalstories.ssgreatbritain.org/_/traveller/11190 in the winter of 1863, but met with little success. His most successful season was in 1864, when in first-class matches he averaged 42 runs an innings, and scored 99 not out for Yorkshire against Notts. He captained the Yorkshire team for a few seasons and in May 1869 a match was played for his benefit at Dewsbury between the All England XI and the United All England XI. Anderson was a right-handed batsman. He played in 99 first-class games, mainly for Yorkshire teams, scoring 2,535 runs at an average of 16.35, with a highest score of 99 not out. His style as a batsman was described as \\"the model of manliness\\"; he had a good defence, and though he took time to get set, he was in his day the hardest and cleanest hitter of the best bowling. In 1862, he made a drive for eight runs at the Oval, when playing for the North of England against Surrey. Another hit by him off Bennett, the Kent slow bowler, was reputed to have pitched farther than any previously recorded at the Oval. On retiring from professional cricketing, Anderson became in 1873 actuary of the Bedale Savings Bank, and held the office until the bank's failure in 1894. He died at Bedale on 27 November 1902.

In 1882, he founded the Helsinki Orchestral Society, Finland's first professional orchestra. As a conductor, he was also a notable champion and interpreter of the music of Jean Sibelius. Life Kajanus studied music theory with Richard Faltin, violin with Gustaf Niemann in Helsinki, with Hans Richter, Carl Reinecke and Salomon Jadassohn in Leipzig and Johan Svendsen in Paris.Finnish Music Information Centre Robert Kajanus biography page; accessed 29 March 2011. His music drew on the folk legends of the Finnish people. He worked in Dresden in the years immediately after his graduation, and returned to Helsinki in 1882. He founded the first permanent orchestra in Finland: the Helsinki Orchestral Society (later to become the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra, Finland's national orchestra). He brought the orchestra to a very high performance standard very quickly, so that they were able to give quite credible performances of the standard late classical/mid-romantic repertory. Kajanus led the Helsinki Philharmonic for 50 years, and among the milestones of that history was the first performance in Finland of Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 in 1888. His early- electric 78-rpm atmospheric, authoritative recordings of Sibelius symphonies are still interpretive milestones. Sketch of Kajanus conducting by Akseli Gallen-Kallela in 1893 Portrait of Kajanus by Albert Edelfelt, 1905 Kajanus was appointed director of music at the University of Helsinki in 1897 and remained in the post for the next 29 years, a period in which he had a major impact on music education in his native country. In 1917, he became the first president of the Finnish Musicians' Union. He was also the founder of the Nordic Music Festival in 1919. He received many decorations, including the French L√©gion d'honneur. Family Kajanus's parents were Georg August Cajanus (1812‚Äì1888) and Agnes Ottilia Flodin (1824‚Äì1902).Yrj√∂ Kotivuori, Ylioppilasmatrikkeli 1640‚Äì1852: Georg August Kajanus. Verkkojulkaisu 2005 . visited 22.3.2015.http://www.geni.com/people/Agnes-Flodin/5500561413610117694 Robert Kajanus was the father of harpists Lilly Kajanus-Blenner (1885‚Äì1963) and Aino Kajanus-Mangstr√∂m (1888‚Äì1951), and violinist Kaj Kajanus (1908-1994); the grandfather of award-winning Finnish/Norwegian sculptor Johanna Kajanus; and great-grandfather of pop musician and composer Georg Kajanus, who was famous for a while in Great Britain with his band Sailor which enjoyed chart success in the mid-1970s. Selected works Kajanus composed over 200 works, of which Aino and the Finnish Rhapsodies are enduringly popular. He also orchestrated the Finnish national anthem, Maamme (Our Country) and Christian Fredric Kress's Porilaisten marssi (March of the People of Pori), the honor march of the Suomen puolustusvoimat (Finnish Defense Forces) and thus, effectively, the Finnish presidential march.BIS Records : Finlandia : A Festival of Finnish Music:fi:Porilaisten marssi * Adagietto * Aino, symphonic poem for male chorus and orchestra (1885) * Suomalainen rapsodia (Finnish rhapsody) No. 1 in D minor, Op. 5 (1881) * Suomalainen rapsodia (Finnish rhapsody) No. 2 in F major (1886) * Huutolaistyt√∂n kehtolaulu (The Pauper Girl's Lament) * Kullervon surumarssi (Kullervo's Funeral March), Op. 3 (1880); contains the folk tune \\"Velisurmaaja\\" (\\"The brother-slayer\\") * Lyrische St√ºcke (1879) * Overtura sinfonica for orchestra (1926) * Piano Sonata (1876) * Sechs Albumbl√§tter (1877) * Sotamarssi (War March), with lyrics by A.

He was considered an authority on the interpretation of Sibelius's music, and he and Sibelius were close friends; but this was compromised in 1898 when Sibelius was appointed to a university post for which Kajanus was himself a candidate. Kajanus appealed, and the decision was overturned. But they reconciled for the orchestra's tour of Europe in 1900, where they appeared at the Exposition Universelle at the invitation of the French government. Kullervo, Sibelius's epic masterpiece, was written in the wake of Kajanus' symphonic poem Aino although Sibelius denied any exertion of influence of this piece over his own work. Additionally, as a conductor, Kajanus was responsible for commissioning one of Sibelius' most popular and enduring works, En Saga, following the success of Kullervo. Pohjola's Daughter was dedicated to Kajanus. When Kajanus took the Helsinki Orchestra on a tour of Europe in 1900 both he and Sibelius conducted, including what proved to be the first performances of Sibelius's music outside of Finland. This ensured the spread of the young composer's reputation far beyond the borders of his homeland, the first Finnish composer to receive such attention. Kajanus was the first to make recordings of Sibelius's First, Second, Third and Fifth symphonies and Tapiola. They were recorded in the early 1930s, with the London Symphony Orchestra. The relationship between Kajanus and Sibelius was such that his interpretations of the composer's music are usually regarded as authentic.Finnish Music Information Centre Robert Kajanus in Profile by Kimmo Korhonen, 2000; accessed 29 March 2011. In 1930, the Finnish government and Britain's EMI-Columbia label, perceiving a potentially wide audience for the composer's work, jointly arrange to record Sibelius's first two symphonies, and Kajanus was selected to record both at the insistence of the composer. In 1932 Kajanus recorded Symphonies Nos. 3 and 5, along with orchestral suites and tone poems. This was a massive recording project for the work of a living composer, and the recordings have been considered definitive for many years and are regarded as necessary listening in the study of Sibelius. Only his death in July 1933, at the age of 76, prevented Kajanus from recording all of Sibelius' Symphonies.

The Colt Model 1908 Pocket Hammerless is a variant introduced five years later in .380 ACP caliber. Despite the title \\"hammerless\\", the Model 1903 does have a hammer. The hammer is covered and hidden from view under the rear of the slide. This allows the pistol to be carried in and withdrawn from a pocket quickly and smoothly without snagging. History Approximately 570,000 Colt Pocket Hammerless pistols were produced from 1903 to 1945, in five different types. Some were issued to US Army and US Air Force general officers from World War II through the 1970s; these were replaced in 1972 with the RIA Colt M15 general officer's model, a compact version of the M1911A1. The Shanghai Municipal Police issued the M1908 to its officers in the 1920s and 1930s and it was a popular model with police in the United States such as the Boston Police Department. In addition to lawful owners, many gangsters of the pre- World War II era favored the Model 1903 and Model 1908 because they were relatively small and easily concealed. It is said that Al Capone kept one in his coat pocket and Bonnie Parker used one to break Clyde Barrow out of jail after smuggling it into the jail by taping it to her thigh. Bank robber John Dillinger was carrying this model of pistol when he was shot by FBI agents outside the Biograph theater on July 22, 1934, and another famous bank robber, Willie Sutton, had one when he was captured by police in Brooklyn on February 18, 1952. Note: There was also a Colt Model 1903 Pocket Hammer pistol in .38 ACP, but this design is unrelated. The FN Model 1903 pistol design is related to the Colt Pocket Hammerless, but it is physically larger due to its chambering in the 9√ó20mm SR Browning Long cartridge. General officer models General officer models were often engraved with the officer's name. Recipients include generals Eisenhower, Bradley, Marshall, and Patton. Patton's Model 1908 was embellished with three (later four) stars on the grip panels to denote his rank. They were issued with a fine-grade leather holster, leather pistol belt with gold-metal clasp, rope pistol lanyard with gold-metal fittings, and leather two-pocket ammunition pouch with gold-metal fasteners. They came in russet or black leather (depending on service and regulations) and were made by Atchison Leather Products or Hickock. A cleaning rod and two spare magazines were also included. Generals were issued the Model M in .380 ACP, until 1950, when supplies ran out. At that point, they were substituted with .32 models until their replacement in 1972. The Pocket Hammerless was replaced by the M15 pistol made by Rock Island Arsenal in .45 ACP. Today, the Pocket Hammerless is manufactured by U.S. Armament, and is licensed by Colt. Design Colt Model 1908 Pocket Hammerless .380 ACP. Its serial number dates manufacture to 1919.This is a Colt' US Armament reprise of the 1903 pocket model. It has all of the major updates except the magazine disconnector that was added in 1926. Dismounting for cleaning resembles the Colt .25 \\"Vest Pocket \\" Pistol of 1906 but is considerably easier. This pistol is actually fired by action of a hammer striking and driving a firing pin into a center- fire cartridge's primer. The hammer is covered by the rear of the slide. The \\"hammerless\\" designation was merely an advertising designation pointing out the pistol's particular suitability for concealed carry. Special features include a serrated slide to prevent slippage during manual cycling of the slide and two safety mechanisms (a grip safety and a manual safety). The grip safety is a spring-loaded piece making up the back strap of the pistol. The grip safety, though not solely restricted to them, was a typical feature of Colt automatic pistols. A magazine safety was added on later models; this feature prevents the pistol from being fired with a round in the chamber and the magazine removed. In 1908, a .380 ACP version of this gun was introduced. Called the Model 1908, it is nearly identical to the Model 1903 except for the bore diameter and the magazine, which hold seven rounds (one less than the Model 1903). Grip panels are black checked hard rubber, checked walnut, or special order materials (ivory, mother of pearl, inset medallion). Sights are fixed, although the rear sight is drift-adjustable for windage. Metal finish is blued or nickel, and some special-order finishes such as engraved, silver- or gold-plated.

Trivia Former Japanese Prime Minister Hideki Tojo used a Colt Model 1903 to attempt suicide shortly before his arrest for war crimes in September 11, 1945. Tojo was convicted at trial and was executed on December 23, 1948. Tojo's pistol is on display at the MacArthur Memorial in Norfolk, Virginia.

Its summit has an elevation of (or according to the IGN-Peru map). It is one of many prominent peaks located within the boundaries of Peru's Huascar√°n National Park. Artesonraju has two distinguished climbing routes; however due to their difficulties, Artesonraju is seldom successfully climbed in comparison to other well known mountains in the Cordillera Blanca. Climbing There is no easy route to the summit of Artesonraju, with all climbing routes rated at least D (difficile/difficult) according to the International French Adjectival System. The primary climbing route is the North Ridge Route, rated D+.\\"Artesonraju North Ridge\\" This route runs along the north ridge from the Santa Cruz ravine and it was the route used in 1932 by Erwin Hein ed Erwin Schneider of the Deutscher und √ñsterreichischer Alpenverein for the first successful climb. Pisco. The standard route up Artesonraju varies year over year due to route condition changes. Another well known climbing route is the Southeast Face Route, rated D. The approach begins in the city of Caraz at an altitude of , and from there proceeds upward another 2,000 meters along a 32-km dirt road to Lake Par√≥n. A path along the lake's north shore brings climbers to the Base Camp at . It involves a trek from Par√≥n lagoon to the base of the face of the mountain and then a long climb from a camp at . This Southeast Face Route is one of the classic Andean climbs, although due to climate change it has become increasingly dangerous and out of condition to climb. In the event that the route is in condition to be climbed, it demands good ice climbing technique, as it involves climbing at about 50-55 degrees for well over 900 vertical meters, with some pitches at 60 degrees. At the end of the dry season a bergschrund can make problematic the last section of the climb. The route is rated D and was climbed the first time on the 24 June 1969 by K. Schreckenbach, H. Saler and K. Sussmilch. A large number of accidents have happened descending the Southeast Ridge Route, primarily due to the failure of snow anchors while abseiling. The summit ridge of Artesonraju accessed by the North Ridge Route is well known for its fragility; special care must be taken as there is an unusually high risk of avalanches at the start of the climbing season here. For this reason parties must gauge the safety propositions between the North Ridge Route and the Southeast Face Route.

Castle Fraser, their family seat, is in Sauchen, Aberdeenshire, Scotland. Since the time of Alexander Fraser, 11th Lord Saltoun, the heads of the Philorth family are the Lords Saltoun. The current head of the Frasers of Philorth is Flora Fraser, 21st Lady Saltoun who is Chief of the Name and Arms of Clan Fraser since 1 May 1984, by decree of the Court of the Lord Lyon. The family's arms are \\"azure, three cinquefoils argent\\"‚Äîthree silver strawberry flowers on a field of blue. The heraldic cinquefoil is a stylized five-point leaf; the cinquefoils which appear the Fraser of Philorth coat-of-arms are specifically strawberry flowers. Only the Lady or Lord Saltoun is permitted to display these arms plain and undifferenced. History Fraserburgh Alexander's grandson, also Alexander, married a daughter of the Earl of Ross, acquiring the lands of Philorth in Buchan, plus the castle of Cairnbulg, which has been the seat of the Fraser chiefs from that time forward. In 1592, Sir Alexander, 8th Lord of Philorth, was given a charter by James VI for the fishing village of Faithlie. He improved the harbour, making the area a thriving town, which soon became a free port and burgh called Fraserburgh, a rival of Aberdeen. Fraserburgh was to have had a university, but the religious troubles and competition from Aberdeen stemmed the town‚Äôs growth. By building Fraserburgh Castle the Laird bankrupted himself, and had to sell the Castle of Philorth which passed out of the family for over 300 years until the 19th Lord Saltoun bought it back in 1934. Alexander, 9th Lord of Philorth, married the heiress of the Lord Saltoun, a title borne by the Clan Fraser chiefs since that time. The Chiefship was in dispute between the Frasers of Philorth and another branch, which also came from Tweeddale, the Frasers of Muchalls. In the reign of Charles I. The peerage expired with the fourth Lord Fraser, who died in 1716 while on the run as a result of his participation in The Fifteen. The first two sons of Andrew, the 2nd Lord Fraser died in the Battle of Dunbar (1650).

It was released on video on March 28, 2006. Synopsis The movie opens with a recitation of Romans 8:18: I consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us. It has been five years since Sarah's (newcomer Sara Simmonds) soulmate Christopher (Cody Linley) mysteriously disappeared, riding off in a limousine without explanation. The two had become engaged at the age of twelve, planning to marry when both were eighteen. Sarah has kept to that commitment, believing that Chris will return. She is a devotee of Joan of Arc and has begun to experience her own 'heavenly' visions and voices. Recently, these visions have grown in intensity. Their content mostly consists of premonitions of trouble or disaster. Sarah's mother is a paranoid schizophrenic who berates Sarah constantly; she lives instead with her grandmother, an inveterate television- watcher who takes no interest in her. She prays alone in an abandoned chapel in a nearby forest, and confides in a Catholic priest, perhaps with an intent to convert to that faith, although this is never explicitly stated. She unwisely reveals her paranormal experiences to classmates, which in combination with her refusal to keep company with boys has made her something of a high school outcast. She does have at least one close girl friend, and is to play Titania in the school production of A Midsummer Night's Dream. High school reporter Dave (Jake McDorman), a relative newcomer to the school, is intrigued by Sarah and determined to understand her fascination with the \\"virgin maid\\" - Joan of Arc. As Sarah's trust in Dave grows, she leads him to her chapel where she reveals the nature of her spiritual encounters. on the pretext of writing a feature about her for the school paper, Dave questions her thoroughly and investigates her background, discussing details of her life with classmates. Meanwhile, rebellious Alec (Matt Vodvarka) desires Sarah for himself, viewing her virginity as a prize conquest. He is also a member of the trenchcoat mafia, a satanic figure who plants bombs around the school. His goals seem to be to have sex with Sarah and kill everyone else. Alec apparently becomes possessed by a demon and attempts to attack Sarah and murder Dave, but the pair are saved by a gigantic bull which appears out of nowhere and is possibly of heavenly origin. At the same time, Dave reveals his own secret; he is Chris. He has been lying to Sarah, leading her down the path for months, because he wanted ironclad proof that she had kept her commitment to him. Also, he wants her to love him as he is now, not as the image of the twelve-year-old she remembers. No explanation is given for his sudden disappearance, but it is hinted that he comes from an extremely wealthy family. The film ends with Dave/Chris and Sarah completing their vows and living as husband and wife.

Licensed to Ocean Acres, New Jersey, it serves Ocean & Burlington counties in New Jersey. It first began broadcasting in 1993 under the call sign WQNJ, but more recently operated under WKMK. The station is currently owned by Press Communications.http://www.fcc.gov/fcc- bin/fmq?call=WKMK FCC FM Query Coverage Area 98.5's signal blankets Ocean and Burlington in New Jersey as well as the New Jersey suburbs of Philadelphia. The station can be heard from Atlantic City to the South, Belmar to the North, and Philadelphia to the West. The WBBO antenna is co-located with WVBH and W265CS on a tower located near the intersection of Route 72 and the Garden State Parkway in Manahawkin. Early history 98.5 was granted the WQNJ calls on February 7, 1990. Even before this station hit the air, it had extensive coverage in the local newspapers, because it was to be the first commercial station to hit the air in Ocean County since WJRZ signed on in 1976. FM 98.5 was originally owned by Seaira, Inc., a local company that was headed by Pat Parson, a former WCBS/880 news anchor from 1970 to 1990 and a former alumnus of WERA in Planfield. Parson originally planned 98.5 to be a live and local Smooth Jazz station, using the slogan \\"Cloud Nine,\\" with an original sign-on date of Spring 1991. However, that sign-on date changed many times, due mostly because of antenna clearances that had to be taken care of prior to signing on. In late 1992, with Seaira not having enough financial backing to sign on themselves with a local format, 98.5 entered into an agreement with D&K; Broadcasting (the owners of WJLK at the time.) On February 11, 1993, WQNJ began on-air testing and on March 10, 1993, officially signed on with a simulcast of 94.3 WJLK. It was pretty much a 100% simulcast, with the exception of local commercial cut-ins and on weekday mornings at 6, 7, 8 and 9 o‚Äôclock, Pat Parson would do a 5-minute newscast. This basic format lasted until 1996 when it was announced that Nassau Broadcasting had purchased the station (and others in the Jersey Shore area.) B98.5 The original B98.5 logo Pat Parson's newscasts were soon discontinued. The simulcast continued with WJLK until Memorial Day weekend in 1997 when Nassau launched \\"B-98.5 ‚Äì The Jersey Shore's Hit Music Station.\\" The first song played on \\"B-98.5\\" was the Spice Girls \\"Wannabe\\". On July 11, 1997, the calls were changed to WBBO. In 2001, Nassau sold WBBO (along with WOBM-FM and WJLK) to Millennium Radio Group. in march of 2002 WCHR 105.7 simulcast was on the air but on April 15, 2002 105.7 WCHR ends it Simulcast and WCHR changes it format to Classic Rock. In April 2003, it was announced that Millennium was selling WBBO to Press Communications, who ironically enough, was the original applicant for 98.5 in the late 1980s. In August 2004, Press officially took over WBBO. Alumni Original Staff * Neil Sullivan, Program Director 1997‚Äì1999 * Fox Feltman (aka.

On July 5, 2006, 98.5 changed calls to WKOE as part of a switch with new move-in 106.5 in Bass River Township. WKOE was formerly located at 106.3 in Ocean City On July 24, 2006 at midnight, the simulcast on 98.5 ceased.

The WKOE call letters were quickly replaced with WKMK to avoid a legal situation after it was noted that using WKOE on a country formatted station violated a usage agreement that Press Broadcasting signed regarding the WKOE calls.

Determinism is the philosophical proposition that every event, including human cognition and action, is causally determined by an unbroken chain of prior occurrences. In other words, Determinism holds that Free Will does not exist, and that everything is essentially pre-determined. But this presents a puzzle: If everything is pre-determined, why should we worry about the future, if it is something we cannot change? \\"Lazy Reason\\" is the idea that, indeed, we should not worry about the future, and should instead just accept whatever the future holds. Historical Discussion One of the most vocal opponents of \\"lazy reason\\" was the philosopher Leibniz. In his preface to Theodicy, Leibniz discussed \\"lazy reason\\": :Men have been perplexed in well-nigh every age by a sophism which the ancients called the 'Lazy reason', because it tended towards doing nothing, or at least towards being careful for nothing, and only following inclination for the pleasure of the moment. For, they said, if the future is necessary, that which must happen will happen, whatever I may do. Now the future (so they said) is necessary, whether because the Divinity foresees everything, and even pre-establishes it by the control of all things in the universe; or because everything happens of necessity, through the concatenation of causes; or finally, through the very nature of truth, which is determinate in the assertions that can be made on future events, as it is in all assertions, since the assertion must always be true or false in itself, even though we know not always which it is. And all these reasons for determination which appear different converge finally like lines upon one and the same center; for there is a truth in the future event which is pre-determined by the causes, and God pre-establishes it in establishing the causes. In his Discourse on Metaphysics, Leibniz also says: :\\"One should not be a quietist with the arms folded, open to ridicule, awaiting that which God will do; according to the sophism which the ancients called 'logon aergon', the lazy reason.\\" A modern example One near contemporary presentation of lazy reason is the theme of the 1956 popular song \\"Que Sera, Sera (Whatever Will Be, Will Be)\\". In the song, a young child repeatedly asks questions about her future, but is advised that \\"Whatever will be, will be\\": :When I was just a child in school, I asked my teacher, what should I try? :Should I paint pictures? Should I sing songs? This was her wise reply: :Que sera sera-- Whatever will be, will be. The future's not ours to see; :So, que sera sera-- What will be, will be.

Cities served by the area code include Altoona, Bradford, DuBois, Erie, Meadville, Oil City, Titusville, Johnstown, St. Marys, and Warren as well as the boroughs of State College, Brockway, Clearfield, Huntingdon, Mount Union, Bedford, Clarion, Punxsutawney, Tyrone, Ebensburg, Coudersport, Ridgway and Brookville. Area code 814 is the original area code assigned to the service area in 1947, and area code 582 is an additional code for the area to form an overlay plan with a starting date of October 3, 2020. History Area code 814 is one of the original numbering plan area (NPA) codes established in 1947. Its geographic area is the largest in the state. It is the only one of Pennsylvania's original four NPAs that still has its original boundaries, and is one of the few original area codes (not counting those serving an entire state) that have never been split or overlaid as of 2020. With area code 717 having been overlaid with area code 223 in 2017, as of 2020, 814 is the only portion of Pennsylvania where seven-digit dialing is still possible. The largest cities in the area are Johnstown, Altoona, State College and Erie; otherwise this region is largely rural. On May 14, 2020, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission decided to assign area code 582 in an overlay plan to the existing 814 territory, in the face of projections that 814 would exhaust in late 2022. It will enter service on October 3, 2020. On that date, a permissive dialing period will begin, during which both seven- and ten-digit calls can complete. Ten-digit dialing is scheduled to be mandatory on April 3, 2021 for all calls in the region. The first 582 numbers will be available for assignment on May 1, 2021. The addition of 582 will eliminate the last area of seven-digit dialing in the Commonwealth. Split controversy Map of previous proposed split of 814 with 582, showing county lines. When numbering pool exhaustion became a threat in the 2000s, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PUC) approved a numbering plan split in December 2009, that would have assigned area code 582 to most of the northwestern portion of the 814 territory, including Erie, in 2012. Under the proposed split, area code 582 would have served Erie, Crawford, Warren, Venango, Forest, Clarion, Jefferson, Elk, and McKean counties, while the remaining counties would've remained in 814. Parts of Armstrong, Clearfield, Indiana, and Mercer counties also were to be switched to 582. Under the plan, most of Clearfield and Indiana counties would have retained 814; most of Armstrong and Mercer counties would continue in area code 724. This would have been the first split in the NANP since 2007. After the decision, a grassroots movement circulated an online petition to request the commission to cancel the action in favor of an overlay plan. The telecommunications industry also supported implementing 582 as an overlay. By February 27, 2012, the projected exhaustion date for 814 was changed to the second quarter of 2018. On April 26, 2012 the PUC voted 5‚Äì0 to dismiss the plans to split 814 and revoke the implementation schedule. At the time, projections suggested that 814 would be exhausted around 2021.

Its hub airport was Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport in Serbia while its technical base was in Cologne Bonn Airport in Germany. The airline declared bankruptcy on 8 November 2006. History Centavia was established in 2005 and received its first aircraft, a BAe 146-200, on 15 June 2006 from Meridiana.1 2_3 4 Its founder and CEO, Predrag Vujoviƒá, had previously attempted to set up an airline company called Air Maxi, but those plans had been abandoned due to a lack of funding. Centavia's first (charter) flight took place on 8 July 2006, to Belgrade from Corfu. For the initial period, only charter flights were operated. The airline's second aircraft arrived on 17 August 2006 and was registered as YU-AGM.1 Centavia was to be the first airline to operate flights from Belgrade to Zagreb since the dissolution of Yugoslavia. However, the Croatian Authorities rejected the airline's application, saying that no bilateral agreements existed between the two states and that the European Open Skies Agreement, ratified by Croatia, would not be applicable in this case. Similarly, the Montenegrin government denied the airline landing rights due to Serbian withdrawal of the AOC of Montenegro Airlines' daughter company, Master Airways, rejection dramatically deteriorated the economic ties between the two former Yugoslav Republics. It was later confirmed that the European Commission requested detailed explanation from both the Croatian and Montenegrin Authorities over their rejection of landing rights. The airline's demise was seen as collateral damage of the unresolved issues and disputes between the Republics of former Yugoslavia. Only Slovenia approved Centavia's operations request without any difficulties. Centavia was to code share on the Belgrade to Ljubljana flights with Adria Airways of Slovenia. Centavia had received permissions and landing rights from Slovenia, Germany, Italy and Switzerland and planned to start flights to these states in the winter of 2006. Centavia also held informal talks with Wizz Air of Hungary to jointly operate certain flights. Centavia's two leased aircraft were returned to the lessor, BAE Systems, on 9 November 2006.

Starting out in 2006 as a Family First Party member of the South Australian Legislative Council, he became South Australian state leader of Australian Conservatives, before defecting to the Liberal Party shortly after the 2018 state election. Dennis now holds the position of Government Whip in the Legislative Council. Early life and career Hood was born to working-class parents in Salisbury, Adelaide, South Australia; his father a Vietnam War veteran and his mother legally blind. He holds a bachelor's degree in Arts (Politics) and Economics from the University of Adelaide, and subsequently became an executive for Johnson & Johnson's pharmaceuticals. Legislative career Hood became the federal director of Family First in 2005, and was selected as its primary candidate for the South Australian Legislative Council in the 2006 state election. He was elected with the assistance of preferences on a primary vote of 5%, becoming the party's second representative in state parliament's upper house. Family First and the other minor parties, share the balance of power in the Legislative Council. Although Hood tends to hold party lines, as distinct from the mandatory requirements of the Liberal Party and Labor Party, and more like the Greens, party members exhibit a unique flavor of policy, as evident by Hood sometimes operating independently from his colleague Brokenshire, analogous to Bob Brown who described his own party as having \\"as many factions as there were candidates\\".Bob Brown interview with Kerry O'Brien, 5 July 2010, Australian Broadcasting Corporation In July 2011, Hood wrote to The Advertiser complaining about what he claimed were factual errors and false assertions in an article about Family First. In 2009, Hood suggested the scrapping of compulsory voting, on the basis that he considers it is undemocratic to force people to cast a vote, despite the fact that South Australian electoral legislation only requires a voter to attend a polling booth, not to mark a ballot paper. He also established a Parliamentary committee to evaluate the establishment of marine parks off the coast of South Australia, which involves the examination of the environment, economic and social impacts. In 2011, Hood advocated the creation of a police task force to address the backlog of unexecuted arrest warrants. Hood supported the redevelopment of the Adelaide Oval, with some amendments. In 2010, Hood noted that the State Coroner needed more resources to address the backlog in cases. Hood has advocated increased accountability of government departments, describing the referral of SHine SA, a Government organization specializing in sexual health, of disabled clients to a list of prostitutes, was a \\"gross misuse of taxpayer money\\", with then opposition leader Iain Evans concurring that a government-funded agency should never advocate what is technically an illegal activity. He has also raised concerns about the AIDS Council, and questioned Gail Gago on why the Government was funding an organization that demands job applicants use drugs and participate in prostitution as mandatory prerequisite for employment. Earlier, Hood attacked the AIDS Council for stating \\"children are a blessing [because] you never know when you'll need someone to go out and score [drugs] for you\\", and that \\"alcohol is fun, but take drugs instead and you will remember your night out\\", in what Christopher Pyne concurred as \\"foolish and irresponsible\\". Hood also voted not to provide Auditor-General Ken McPherson, who drafted the report into corruption and bullying at the Burnside Council, an extension of term, as he has already served 21 years. Equally, Hood has encouraged the injection of capital into Government units that look after vulnerable people who are abused in state care. Hood is perceived to be antagonistic to the Greens, in such policies as providing the right to remove dangerous, sick and dying trees, which the Greens strongly opposed. Hood endorsed weekly garbage collection, in a move the Greens disagreed with because it leads to increases in the amount of household rubbish going to landfill Hood has also been a strong opponent of euthanasia legislation introduced by Steph Key on the basis it fails to provide sufficient corroborative evidence of the desire for suicide apart from the killer as the sole witness, and that the elderly and dying could be pressured into suicide if they felt they became a burden on their family, essentially, that voluntary euthanasia, fortuitously, causes involuntary euthanasia. He also raised the issue that the Greens, who oppose capital punishment, endorse euthanasia. Hood has criticized the high abortion rate, in light of low fertility rates, and has encouraged adoption in lieu. Hood has rejected the scrapping of parliamentary prayer, saying the practice dates back to the establishment of the Westminster system, and that the brief periods were useful for silent reflection. Hood has also rejected legislation to permit the cloning of human embryos, on the basis new technology could create embryonic stem cells without using human embryos and eggs, thereby making the legislation unnecessary. Hood has opposed the decriminalisation of prostitution. which he states is consistent with his Christian feminist position. Hood has also suggested plain-packaged DVD's for content that is restricted by law. Despite being lampooned by the Chaser's War on Everything, in that it is necessary to have sexual intercourse to have families,The Chaser's War on Everything, Season 2 Episode 22, 31 October 2007 Hood denies he has spoken with the Australian Sex Party for a preference deal. Hood has rejected the Greens call to name and shame religious schools which discriminate based on sexual orientation on their web site. Although sometimes failing to block Green legislation, Hood has provided opposition rigor necessary to challenge status quo, including public consultation. The Greens however, sometimes work cooperatively with Family First, for instance in Bob Brown's call for national changes to electoral legislation, following the issue of counterfeit how-to-vote cards by the Labor Party that were passed off as Family First electoral material, in what was also called \\"unethical, if not illegal\\" by opposition leader Isobel Redmond. The antagonism was not evident in Hood and the Greens's advocacy of the Adelaide Oval redevelopment. In fact, Parnell has voted in the same way as Hood on several occasions, against both the government and opposition. Nevertheless, Hood has stated that he will never make a preference deal with the Greens, as their core policies are irreconcilable with the positions of Family First. Hood has called for a ban of nudist beaches, on the basis that children could inadvertently be exposed. Hood has also rejected same-sex parenting on the basis that children of same- sex parents wouldn't gain the right to have heterosexual parents. Hood has advocated mandatory parental consent for children getting a body piercing. Hood has advocated for the permission to administer non-sexual smacking of children by their parents Hood has recommended pragmatic child abuse checks by external agencies to address growing dismay relating to the Department of Community Services. Despite saying that his party was comfortable with modest age-appropriate sexual education programs, Hood has remained staunchly opposed to the sex education of primary school kids. In a similar manner, Hood has supported the call of independent MP Bob Such, who has advocated the introduction of a religious education program focusing on compassion, respect and knowledge of various religions. Hood has also recommended a review of the classification system, and that some content classified general should be upward classified, as evident in the comical but paradoxical newshed \\"G-rated g-string\\" Hood has also been vocal about the failure of the Advertising Standards Board to properly screen out material of poor taste, including a liquor advertisement with the buttocks of three adult males exposed nude, in what the RAA concurred is a distraction to driving. Hood has worked with Attorney-General John Rau on a number of bills, including the outlawing of minors from practicing scarification. Hood has established a reputation for being tough on crime, in particular drugs, suggesting tougher controls on the growing and possession of cannabis, on the basis that possession of commercial quantities ($40,000) would only attract a small (maximum of $500) fine, and provided insufficient disincentive. He has also requested on-the-spot fine for users of heroin, meth-amphetamines, cocaine and ecstasy. He has opposed the use of drug driving and drugs in public, saying it is a threat to the welfare of residents and businesses, as well as to the individual themselves. He introduced law to increase police powers to seize a convicted child molester's computer at any time without a court order to examine its contents, essentially shifting the burden of proof and replacing it with a reasonable cause to suspect that a sex crime is taking place. Despite Labor has personified itself as \\"tough on drugs\\", Hood has stated figures show otherwise, and has instead established himself as the authority on crime. Apart from increased fines, Hood has also suggested pragmatic drug testing devices at hotels and nightclubs. Hood recommended and successfully passed laws to adopt this stance by setting minimum, as opposed to maximum sentences, which are never implemented by judges. Hood has rejected even the prescription of marijuana for medicinal purposes, backed by Vickie Chapman, saying the harm outweighs the therapeutic benefits. Perhaps the most fanciful recommendation is the introduction of an online database to record the details of the acquisition and sales of products containing pseudoephedrine, which using data mining technologies could help identify suspicious buyers, in a move which Commissioner of SAPOL, Mal Hyde, agreed with. Hood was also authority on reducing sexual assaults in taxis, his colleague Rob Brokenshire the chairman of the select committee. At a Family First State Executive meeting on 1 February 2007, Hood replaced Andrew Evans as the Family First parliamentary leader.Sunday Mail, 4 February 2007 Although failing to gain the reputation as a serial Freedom of Information Act user as colleague Robert Brokenshire, Hood has been an active user of the FOI too, but has a better reputation for the publication of public records. Nevertheless, Hood is established as the mathematical identity of Family First, involved with the compilation of econometric statistics. Hood called for District Court Judge Marie Shaw to be sacked as a result of failing to impose a sentence upon a series of twelve sex offenders she had presided over. To prevent Shaw from taking him to the Supreme Court for defamation over his naming her as \\"South Australia's softest judge\\", in what Shaw described to cause her to become \\"distressed and humiliated\\", \\"subject to ridicule and contempt\\", Hood settled with her by pronouncing an apology. Chief Justice John Doyle sided with Shaw, saying that judges shouldn't be held personally responsible for their decisions, that much decisions were the inevitable result of precedence, although Judge Shaw eventually resigned just four years after sitting on the bench, despite the principle of tenure, that she could have sat on the bench until she turned 70. Hood's interest in the courts isn't singular, exhibiting particulate interest in the high judicial salaries and pensions that were \\"out of step with\\" community expectations, with salaries $540,000 a year, and retired pensions at $114,534 a year. Hood is also a fond judicial activist, in particular precedence by way of ratio decidendi to change \\"pathetic\\" sentences for \\"very serious crimes\\", ranging from rape to arson, and increase rights for the disabled, including the blind. Following the 2010 election, although Hood's identity has been outweighed by colleague Robert Brokenshire, dubbed the \\"de facto opposition leader\\", Hood has worked with independents Ann Bressington (the Nick Xenophon No Pokies Party) and John Darley, in attempts to improve funding for mental health, disability, child protection and public housing. His work with Bressington, whose 22-year-old daughter Shay-Louise Bressington died from heroin overdose, in the area of \\"tough on drugs\\" is landmark. Bressington however, is positioned as even tougher on drugs, or at least quintuply economically. Hood's proposal draft bill that will allow parents to become better informed of their children's Facebook activity, was accepted by John Rau and Robert McClelland. Hood followed Brokenshire to the Australian Conservatives, led by South Australian Senator Cory Bernardi, after Family First merged into the Conservatives in 2017. However, Hood defected to the Liberal Party nine days after the 2018 state election. Hood noted that the Conservatives had only garnered three percent of first preference votes for the House of Assembly, with none of their 33 lower house candidates coming close to being elected. He claimed that the Conservatives were focused almost entirely on federal issues, and were likely to have \\"no impact\\" at the state level. At the same time, he praised the vision of the newly elected Liberal government, saying that there was a \\"substantial\\" overlap with his own platform.Dennis Hood dumps Cory Bernardi's Australian Conservatives to join SA Liberals: ABC 26 March 2017 Reportedly, Brokenshire had encouraged Hood to consider defecting to the Liberals. When Bernardi learned of Hood's defection, he suspected that the Conservatives had been \\"white-anted from within.\\" Family and personal life Dennis Hood was elected to the South Australian Parliament at the age of 34, and was described by Peter Goers as \\"one of the youngest pollies in State Parliament\\". In 2006, Hood's wife Lisa Hood gave birth to his daughter, Madeline Hood, and said his good experience with the Women's and Children's Hospital was \\"fantastic\\" and \\"outstanding\\", and that he couldn't comprehend why people \\"whinged\\" about the system. He has been a comical conservative voice in South Australia, with such descriptions of the banning of the words \\"ho ho ho\\" during Christmas as \\"plain madness\\" as the word \\"ho\\" could be misconstrued as \\"whore\\", in what a University of South Australia communications senior lecturer concurred as being \\"nonsense\\". Dennis plays the acoustic and electric guitar, is a fan of the Adelaide Crows and loves sports cars, and has been a dissenter on Government policy to crush hoons on the basis of waste. Hood's parents were apathetic toward religion but he converted to Christianity at 19. Hood attends Rostrevor Baptist Church in Adelaide.Polling takes second place to parenthood; The Advertiser. 1 January 2007 When Sunday Mail columnist Peter Goers stated in a critical editorial that Hood was a young earth creationist, Goers (a staunch atheist) and Hood have a comical relationship, the most famous accolade being Goers reporting Hood looks like he \\"walked out of a men's fashion magazine\\" sporting an expensive cotton pullover and suit, and Hood responding in his column that the \\"expensive\\" clothing was obtained from a Salvation Army store. An avid philanthropist, Hood rejected an automatic 6.7% pay rise, and gave it to charity.

The focus is on monsters and fantastical and legendary creatures from religion, mythology, folklore, fairy tales, literary fantasy, science fiction, cryptids and other anomalous phenomena. Monster in My Pocket produced trading cards, comic books, books, toys, a board game, a video game, and an animated special, along with music, clothing, kites, stickers, and various other items. Toys  Figures  Monster in My Pocket was best known as a toy-line released by Matchbox in 1990. It consists of small, soft plastic figures representing monsters, and later other tangentially related characters. In its first run, there were 11 series released. There were over 200 monsters in the collection, most of which were assigned a point value. Among the highest valued monsters were the Tyrannosaurus Rex, Griffin, Great Beast, Behemoth, Hydra, Werewolf (25 points) and among the least being Charon, The Invisible Man, The Witch (5 points). Initially, the high point value was 25, which was elevated to 30 for the second and third series; the fourth, \\"Super Scary\\", series introduced the 50-100 point monsters. The toys were initially solid-colored, though later series would gradually add more painted colors, until they became fully colored under the auspices of new toy makers Corinthian Marketing and Vivid Imaginations. The lines ran into difficulty in the Hindu communities, as the divinities KƒÅlƒ´, Ganesha, Hanuman, and Yama, were all depicted as \\"monsters\\", which included a public outcry by the Vishva Hindu Parishad.Global Dharma (column). Hinduism Today. November 1993. http://www.hinduismtoday.com/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=1077 After the fourth series, which contained Hanuman (who was removed from the UK run) and Yama, was released, they decided to play it safe and provided follow-up series: Super Creepies, 24 comical (punning) aberrations of real insects and arachnids created by \\"Dr. Zechariah Wolfram\\" with point values up to 200, 24 Dinosaurs, released in both regular and \\"Secret Skeleton\\" format, and 16 Space Aliens that were essentially original. The point values increased even further, up to 500. A second series of dinosaurs is rarer than series 3, and included only four premium figures released with confectionery, numbered #223 to #226. In some markets, such as Argentina, the dinosaurs were released as Dinosaur in My Pocket. Many of these were not released outside of Europe. The Dinosaurs appear to have been released in the U.S. only through premium distribution by Hardee's, and these were not the standard figures that were sold in stores. They were mainly yellow, green, orange and red but monsters with more than 30 points had more than just one color. Other toys included Super Scary Howlers representing Vampire, The Monster, Swamp Beast, and Werewolf, a Monster Mountain display case with custom labels for series 1, a Monster Pouch fanny pack, Battle Cards featuring The Beast and Witch, and a Haunted House playset, which was never released, although it was shown at Toy Fair 1992.  Board game  A board game was also released by Decipher Limited, which used the action figures as playing pieces. The game involved using the monsters to fight battles in terrains where they had different strengths‚ÄîNew York, Tundra, Volcano, and Swamp.  Monster Wrestlers in My Pocket  The Monster Wrestlers in My Pocket debuted in the United Kingdom in 1994, no longer produced by Matchbox, but by Corinthian Marketing. The first nine, including Tony the Tiger as a coach, were released in Kellogg's Frosties cereal. The numbering was restarted, the high point value was returned to 100, and the coaches and referees, except for the 100 point \\"Tony the Coach\\", were the first monsters designated with 0 points. Forty-five figures were released in total, with six variant figures released as premiums in a White Castle fast food promotion. Frosties also did a twelve-monster series of Monster Sports Stars in My Pocket, including \\"Tony the Referee\\", which were made of much harder plastic and had no point values. Seventeen Monster Ninja Warriors in My Pocket were produced in 1996 by Vivid Imaginations, some of which came with vehicles and accessories. These also were the first Monster in My Pocket figures with removable weapons. The figures that were not made by Matchbox were painted in full colors and came in only a few variations, rather than previously coming in multiple solid or tri-tone colors.  Relaunches  The line was revived in the United Kingdom in 2003, titled Monster in My Pocket: The Quest, with deluxe figures of the principal monster characters and reissues of the series 1-2 monsters essentially unchanged. The toys were made by Corinthian Marketing. Pyramid Marketing was to have created an animated series, but it was never completed. Monster in My Pocket was divorced from the renamed \\"Monster Quest\\" on December 22, 2004. 2006 has seen another relaunch of the series, also by Corinthian Marketing. Unlike the 2003 series, this one has been completely revamped. Some of the likenesses are closer to earlier source materials, others, such as Kraken, which now looks more humanoid than like a cephalopod, have been further removed. These figures are in full color and have close to the level of detail one often finds in pewter figurines for role-playing games. Kali and Hanuman returned under the names \\"6-Armed Sorceress\\" and \\"Monkeyman\\", while Mattoon, Illinois, never embracing the connection, was dropped off Mad Gasser's name. Spectre was renamed Grim Reaper.  Monster in My Pocket in other media   Trading cards  The earliest Monster in My Pocket items were trading cards painted by Jan Sheets and Jenice Heo. They appeared in 1989, with no credit other than for the Morrison Entertainment Group. The Sheets/Heo art also appears on a great deal of the other material. Paintings were made for at least the first three series as well as the Dinosaurs, though only the first was released in the U.S. Cromy of Argentina released all of these, including prismatic chase cards of many of the series 2 and 3 characters. These were also released in a sticker album format, including a series 1 only edition in the U.S. from Panini. Both were accompanied by sketch art depicting cartoons of the characters.  Comic books  A comic book series written by Dwayne McDuffie (initially working from a plot by Craig Mitchell, R.L. Stern, and Tim Bogart), and drawn primarily by Gil Kane and Ernie Col√≥n (with Nelson Dewey) was released by Harvey Comics in 1991. It ran for four bi-monthly issues, despite an open ending and promises that sales had justified making it monthly. In this series, a spell by Warlock intended to shrink the monsters who did not side with him was botched by Ogre, resulting in the shrinkage of all the monsters who were then flung, within boxes with roomy interiors, to Los Angeles, California. The good monsters ended up in the home of ne'er-do-well high school student Jack Miles and his studious younger brother, Tom, in Burbank. The series ended with both sides battling inside a dollhouse bought for a little girl named Theresa, who was scared away by Spring Heeled Jack. They also dealt with Frank Rook, The Exterminator (a parody of The Punisher), and Swamp Beast helped them defeat a Tyrannosaurus Rex who would grow when exposed to any form of radiation, such as smoke detectors and microwave ovens. Beginning with the second issue, Universal Studios began receiving credit in the indicia for the use of Frankenstein's Monster, Mummy, The Invisible Man, and The Phantom of the Opera, although the characters originated in public domain literature and bore no particular resemblance to their cinematic counterparts at Universal. Marvel Comics reissued the comic stories in newly- formatted annuals, and World Publishing (an imprint of Egmont Publishing) followed by a Monster Wrestlers in My Pocket annual‚Äîwhich had no continuity with the previous series‚Äîin 1995, with a cover dated 1996. Clearly depicted with the evil monsters were Medusa and Spring-Heeled Jack, the two most prominent evil monsters after Warlock, along with Ogre, Cerberus, Minotaur, Windigo, Cyclops, Zombie, Siren, Ymir, Karnak (probably Maahes), Tengu, Bigfoot, Spectre (Grim Reaper), Sebek, Charon, and Ghost, though the evil monsters were most often shown in amorphous crowds. Dr. Jekyll is twice force- fed‚Äîfirst by Warlock, then by The Monster‚Äîthe potion that makes him into Mr. Hyde, but he turns maverick, not much more willing to support Warlock than Vampire. The \\"Sid's Bits\\" editorial in issue 2 of the comic contains a partial listing of good and evil monsters; included in the evil side is a character identified simply as \\"The Electronic Monster.\\" There is no known figure in the series bearing that name. Video game A video game was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1992 by Konami. It had the same essential concept of the comic book, although it altered the personalities of Hobgoblin and Gremlin, initially the good monsters but now appeared as villains, to the extent that Gremlin was a boss. Warlock, wanting to have power and rule over all the other monsters, creates a shrinking spell to use as punishment for any who chooses to oppose him. As time goes on, all of the monsters choose to join his side - except for Vampire and The Monster. However, the spell was miscast - causing all of the monsters to shrink in size. Warlock sends out his henchmen, led by Spring Heeled Jack, Bigfoot, Kraken, Gremlin, and Medusa while Vampire and The Monster are watching TV in the Miles home. They must fight their way through the upstairs and kitchen of the home, the street, and the sewer; they emerge in a construction site and an Orientalist garden before fighting Warlock at Monster Mountain, although that is not the end of the game. Vampire and the Monster's abilities in the game are the same (though 2-player simultaneous action was an option): they can make an attack that can extend slightly beyond their bodies with a bit of a blaze, and they can make a double jump from the height of their jump, something that has since become a common move in many video games. The remaining good monsters from the comics‚ÄîWerewolf, Vampiress, Golem, Swamp Beast, The Phantom of the Opera, Jotun Troll, Invisible Man, Dr. Jekyll, and Mummy‚Äîmade no appearance whatsoever in the game, although Werewolf did appear on the cover. Warlock and Minotaur were the only two monsters from series 2 to appear in the game. In the comic book, however, Medusa declared that by her count, Vampire's side had a majority, though all the other series 1 monsters were included as enemies in the game. Blemmyes appeared prominently on the cover, and the figure was distributed exclusively with the game, though did not appear in the game itself. It came inside the box, next to a smaller piece of styrofoam than NES cartridge boxes normally contained. The Asian release of this game is titled \\"Batman & Flash\\", and is basically a rom hack of the game where the main playable characters are replaced with Batman and The Flash.  Animated special  In 1992, there was an animated special, Monster in My Pocket: The Big Scream, produced by Hanna-Barbera and directed by Don Lusk from a script by Glen Leopold, where Vampire (now with ample hair in a late 18th-century- style ponytail, voiced by Rob Paulsen) became the leader of the villains, and Invisible Man, now named Dr. Henry Davenport (even though he was called the Invisible Man in the intro and was referred to as such by Vampire, voiced by Paxton Whitehead), was in charge of the heroes. Swamp Beast (voiced by Frank Welker) was a mindless villain among the other changes, such as the formerly white-furred Werewolf (although by the fourth issue it had been changed to brown) becoming the Jamaican \\"Wolf-Mon\\" (voiced by Stuart K. Robinson). The other good monsters were Big Ed (The Monster, also voiced by Welker) and Mummy (voiced by Marvin Kaplan), while Medusa (voiced by B. J. Ward) remained among the ranks of the evil monsters. A few others, like Tyrannosaurus Rex and Cyclops, were shown for a second or two during the prologue. The prologue showed that the Invisible Man and the other good monsters had managed to capture and imprison all of the bad monsters in Monster Mountain, now a prison guarded by the good monsters rather than a meeting place (as it had been in the comic book), and Vampire tried to escape by shrinking himself. But the spell backfired and caused everyone of the monsters, as well as the good monsters, to shrink to one inch high and blows the shrunken mountain to Los Angeles. This time, their human host is Carrie Raven, daughter of Edgar Raven, a famous horror writer. The evil monsters learn they would grow at the sound of screams, while the good monsters grow with laughter. The story was that both factions of monsters were trying to regain their size to resume their evil ways or recapture the evil monsters before they could do serious harm. This special ran on Halloween of 1992 on ABC, but it was not carried in all markets. Early releases of the special on video from Vidmark Entertainment contained a glow-in-the-dark monster: Charun, Thunderdell, or Yama.  Commercial tie-ins  There also an audio cassette of original music along with a cover version of Bobby Pickett's \\"Monster Mash\\" titled Monster Rock, produced by Rincon Children's Entertainment for BMG Kidz in 1992. The songs were written by a person with the last name of Byrd, James McDonnell, Peter Pope, Randy Petersen, Robert Irving, and a person with the last name of Quinn. Pope, McDonnell, Petersen, and Irving played the keyboards, George Bell played saxophone, and Barry Scott and Charles Dickens played guitar, with Dickens providing drum programming and engineering. Singers were Jake Vesprille, Michael Hunter, Gigi Young, Barry Scott, Jimmy McDonnell, Mary McDonnell, Rory McDonnell, Peter Hix, Katrina Perkins, and Bob Joyce. \\"Saturday Night at the Boneyard\\" was the only song to mention monsters from series 2 or 3. The other songs are \\"Monster in My Pocket\\", \\"Witches Brew\\", \\"Monsters\\", \\"Can't Do a Thing With My Hair\\" (Byrd/McDonnell), \\"Do the Boo\\", \\"Full Moon Blues\\", \\"Boogie Man Boogie\\" (Byrd/McDonnell/Pope), \\"Monster Party\\" (Petersen/Irving/Quinn), and \\"Party in Your Pocket\\" (Pope). John Weems, Joe Morrison, and Ralph King were the executive producers. In 1994, the monsters received a popularity boost in Mexico; they were part of a promotion from the Sonrics candy company. This promotion consisted of boxes full of candy, a random monster figure, and any of the following: trading cards, mini-comics and mini activity books. Part of this promotion was a collector set modeled after Monster Mountain available by phone order, but oddly the company kept saying by phone there was no such offer.  CGI series  In 2003, Peak Entertainment in the United Kingdom partnered with Mainframe Entertainment to produce a CGI animated series that changed the concept considerably. It dealt with monsters trapped in a \\"Tapestry of Terror\\" that was shredded in battle with the now-good Warlock and his evil brother, \\"Morlock\\". They looked identical save that where Warlock's hair and clothing were white, Morlock's were black. A few good monsters, including Vampiress and The Monster, side with Warlock and his young apprentice to recapture the monsters, including Vampiress' evil brother, Vampire. One addition to the series, according to its bible, was Mothman, which had previously not been represented. The series was picked up by GMTV in the United Kingdom with Cartoon Network eyed as the broadcast partner in the United States, but was ultimately never produced. At MIPCOM 2019, France's Cyber Group Studios unveiled plans for a new CG-animated series produced with Morrison Entertainment Group. The series is being developed by Mike Yank and has a projected budget of $9.5 million USD, with a release set for 2022.  More details about individual monsters  There are at least 229 monsters in the series, though information past #184 is very sketchy. 121-144 are the Super Creepies, 145-168 are Dinosaurs, 169-184 are Space Aliens, and beyond that is a large group of additional dinosaurs. In addition, there are 42 Monster Wrestlers in My Pocket, 12 Monster Sports Stars in My Pocket, and 19 Monster Ninja Warriors in My Pocket, not to mention supporting characters and two relaunches. The Charon and the Charun figures sound alike but they are completely different monsters. The following legendary monsters are part of the Monster in My Pocket series: Except for the Super Scary Series, all of these are included in the Argentine and Mexican sticker books from Cromy with the exception of Bash Tchelik, who is identified in the centerspread of the third issue of the Harvey comic book. Sixteen of these are presumed unreleased as action figures.

He was the head football coach at Albright College (1935‚Äì1936), Syracuse University (1946), and most notably Michigan State College (1947‚Äì1953), where his 1952 squad won a national championship. Munn retired from coaching in 1953 to assume duties as Michigan State's athletic director, a position he held until 1971. Each year, the Michigan State Spartans football team hands out the \\"Biggie Munn Award\\" to the team's most motivational player. MSU's Munn Ice Arena, built in 1974, is named in his honor. Munn was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 1959, and, in 1961, he became Michigan State's first inductee into the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame. He authored the coaching textbook Michigan State Multiple Offense in 1953. Early life and playing career Munn was born in the former Grow Township, now known as Andover, Minnesota. A 1932 graduate of the University of Minnesota, he played guard and fullback for the Golden Gophers under head coach Fritz Crisler. Munn was a two-time first-team All-Big Ten Conference selection and during his senior year in 1931, he served football team captain, was a consensus All-American, and was awarded the Chicago Tribune Silver Football as the Big Ten's best player. Many considered Munn as the top collegiate punter in the nation. He stood just under six feet and weighed 215 pounds, but was recorded running 100 yards in 10 seconds. Munn also served as captain of Minnesota's track and field team. Early coaching career Three years after his playing career ended, Munn got his first head coaching job at Albright College in Reading, Pennsylvania, where he stayed for two seasons (1935‚Äì1936), compiling a record of 13‚Äì2‚Äì1. From 1938 to 1945, he was an assistant football coach at the University of Michigan, once again under Crisler. Munn served as head coach at Syracuse University for one season in 1946 before leaving for Michigan State. One of Munn's assistants at Syracuse was former Orangeman standout Duffy Daugherty, who followed Munn to Michigan State and assisted him there for seven seasons before succeeding Munn as head coach. Munn is one of the few people to have coached at both Michigan State and its archrival Michigan. Coaching career at Michigan State In 1947, Munn and the Michigan State administration, led by university president John A. Hannah, approached Notre Dame president Father Cavanaugh to have his Fighting Irish play the Spartans for the first time since 1921. MSU initially offered to let Notre Dame take 80 percent of the gate, but Cavanaugh insisted they split the receipts down the middle. Munn was the only coach to beat Notre Dame head coach Frank Leahy three years in a row (1950‚Äì1952). Munn developed the \\"Wingback Deep\\" formation of his formula \\"Michigan State Multiple Offense.\\" The play featured a shifting back and forth between a T-formation and a single-wing formation with a direct snap to the tailback between a T-formation quarterback's legs. On the Michigan State dressing room wall, Munn hung a statement on fundamentals that his players were required to read before every home game: \\"Do not cheat your team or your teammates. Know your plays. Block. Protect. Add to what we are trying to do. [signed] Biggie.\\" During the latter part of his coaching career, Munn developed the talents of Willie Thrower, the Big Ten's first black quarterback. In 1953 with the Chicago Bears, Thrower became the first black quarterback to play in the National Football League. In 1952, Munn was named the AFCA Coach of the Year, coaching MSU to 9‚Äì0 record and a national championship. In 1953, Michigan State's first year of conference play in the Big Ten, the Spartans shared the conference title with Illinois and went to the Rose Bowl, where they beat UCLA, 28‚Äì20. Shortly after the Rose Bowl victory, MSU's athletic director, Ralph Young retired. Munn stepped down from coaching to assume duties as athletic director and remained in that position until 1971. Munn named his assistant, Duffy Daugherty, as his to successor to helm the football team. During his tenure as Michigan State's head football coach, Munn tutored 17 All-Americans. His teams have retained the school's top four season marks for rushing-yards-per-game: 1948 (304.5 yards/game), 1951 (293.9 yards), 1952 (272.4), and 1950 (269.3). Munn was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1959. Syracuse University enshrined him in its hall of fame in 1973. Munn was inducted into Minnesota's \\"M\\" Club in 1993. Family and death Munn married the former Vera Jane Wattles (January 21, 1905 ‚Äì January 4, 2004) in June 1935. The couple adopted two children: Michael and Jane Austin. Clarence Munn died on March 18, 1975 in Lansing, Michigan at the age of 66.

In the early 1900s, most workers in Wisconsin received their education through the apprenticeship system - both job skills and academic skills. In order to standardize the education that these working young adults received in reading, writing, and math, the state of Wisconsin promoted the creation of city vocational schools. Schools sprang up in Green Bay and Marinette in 1912, followed in 1941 by a school in Sturgeon Bay. Their scope expanded to include adults of all ages who were interested in technical careers, whether in the work force or not.

He was convicted of honest services fraud in the awarding of a government contract and sentenced to 37 months in the federal prison at Pine Knot, Kentucky. The executive director (EXDIR, the number three position) of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) until 2006, Foggo was charged on February 13, 2007, with fraud and other offenses. This indictment was superseded and expanded with an indictment returned on May 10, 2007, charging fraud, conspiracy and money laundering in relation to his dealings with defense contractor Brent R. Wilkes. On September 29, 2008, Foggo pleaded guilty to one count of the indictment, admitting that while CIA executive director he steered a CIA contract to the firm of his lifelong friend, Brent R. Wilkes. In a pre-sentencing report filed by prosecutors in February 2009, Foggo was also described as having a record of on the job corruption and off the job assaultive behavior stretching back 20 years.  Biography  Foggo grew up in the San Diego, California, area and attended Hilltop High School and later San Diego State University. After brief experience in law enforcement, Foggo entered the CIA through the Presidential Management Intern program and spent much of his career managing and awarding various contracts. Foggo began in what was then known as the CIA's Directorate of Administration (DA) which handled a significant portion of the agency's contracting. He spent most of his CIA career in Management General Services, but also did a stint in the Directorate of Science and Technology. Foggo's early postings included stations in Europe and Latin America, including a position in Honduras in the 1980s where he worked with the US Ambassador to Honduras, John Negroponte, who would go on to become the Director of National Intelligence. Foggo was also chief of the CIA's support base in Germany, the base responsible for providing Middle East stations (including Iraq) with logistical support. As EXDIR, he was responsible for executive management of the CIA bureaucracy. He was appointed, in October 2004, by then-Director of Central Intelligence Porter Goss over the objections of CIA staff.  Criminal investigation  Foggo was charged on February 13, 2007, with fraud and other offenses. Foggo was also investigated by CIA Inspector General John L. Helgerson for involvement in the Congressman Randy \\"Duke\\" Cunningham corruption investigation due to his personal and professional connections with Cunningham co-conspirator Brent Wilkes. Other agencies involved in the investigation include the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Internal Revenue Service, Defense Criminal Investigative Service and the United States Attorney's Office in San Diego. The Cunningham scandal involved defense contractors who paid bribes to members of Congress, and officials in the Defense Department, in return for federal contracts. Most notable among the recipients of the bribes was Cunningham, who pleaded guilty to receiving over $2.3 million in bribes. The primary defense contractors were Mitchell Wade (owner of MZM), who also pleaded guilty, and Wilkes (owner of ADCS Inc.). Wilkes was named as \\"co-conspirator #1\\" in Cunningham's plea agreement. Foggo and Wilkes are longtime friends. They attended school together at Hilltop High School in Chula Vista and San Diego State University, served as best men in each other's weddings, and named their sons after each other. Suspicions were raised when Foggo, a mid-level career manager, was promoted to be the number three official of the CIA. Investigations have centered on whether Foggo helped steer agency contracts to companies run by Wilkes. Specifically, one of Wilkes' corporations received at least one CIA contract to supply bottled water to CIA personnel in Iraq during the invasion in 2003. On May 8, 2006, Newsweek reported: > [A] source has told Newsweek that Foggo had acknowledged to associates that > he may have tipped off Wilkes that CIA contracts were coming up for bid -- > an activity which, according to the source, Foggo said was neither improper > nor illegal. The source is close to a group of poker players who took part > in a 1999 game arranged by Wilkes and attended by Foggo, Cunningham and a > nine-fingered former CIA officer named Brant Bassett, who worked for Goss > when the outgoing CIA chief was House Intelligence Committee chair. Foggo > denies giving Wilkes any such tip-offs, according to another source close to > the outgoing CIA official; Bassett and lawyers for Wilkes and Cunningham had > no comment. The same day, the New York Daily News reported: On May 12, 2006, law enforcement officials executed search warrants on Foggo's house and office. The same day, the Copley News Service reported that Foggo's home in Vienna, Virginia, had been raided by federal agents. The agents reportedly refused to answer questions about the purpose of the raid or what agency they represented. On February 13, 2007, Foggo and Wilkes were indicted by the US Attorney's Office in San Diego. Subsequently, Foggo pleaded \\"not guilty\\" to 30 counts of fraud, conspiracy and money laundering. Prosecutors dropped objections to moving the corruption case against the former CIA official from San Diego to Virginia. This indictment was superseded and expanded with an indictment returned on May 10, 2007, charging fraud, conspiracy and money laundering in relation to his dealings with defense contractor Brent R. Wilkes. On September 29, 2008, Foggo pleaded guilty to one count of the indictment, admitting that while CIA executive director he steered a CIA contract to the firm of his lifelong friend, Wilkes. In a presentencing report filed by prosecutors in February 2009, Foggo was also described as having a record of on the job corruption and off the job assaultive behavior stretching back 20 years.

In 1788 games over 15 seasons, Jones posted a .285 batting average (1920-for-6747) with 1180 runs, 206 doubles, 75 triples, 21 home runs, 631 RBI, 359 stolen bases, 817 bases on balls, .368 on-base percentage and .347 slugging percentage. He finished his career with a .962 fielding percentage. He died of heart disease in Portland, Oregon, at age 62.

It was at one point attributed to William Shakespeare, but is now considered part of the Shakespeare Apocrypha. Date and text Scholars have conjectured dates of authorship for the play as early as 1592, though most favor a date in the 1600‚Äì4 period.Logan and Smith, pp. 209‚Äì10. The Merry Devil enters the historical record in 1604, when it is mentioned in a contemporary work called the Black Booke. The play was entered into the Stationers' Register on 22 October 1607, and published the next year, in a quarto printed by Henry Ballard for the bookseller Arthur Johnson (Q1 ‚Äì 1608). Five more quartos appeared through the remainder of the century: Q2 ‚Äì 1612; Q3 ‚Äì 1617; Q4 ‚Äì 1626; Q5 ‚Äì 1631; and Q6 ‚Äì 1655. All of these quartos were anonymous. Shakespearean authorship Publisher Humphrey Moseley obtained the rights to the play and re-registered it on 9 September 1653 as a work by William Shakespeare. Moseley's attribution to Shakespeare was repeated by Edward Archer in his 1656 play list [see: The Old Law], and by Francis Kirkman in his list of 1661.Chambers, Vol. 4, p. 30. The play was bound with Fair Em and Mucedorus in a book titled \\"Shakespeare. Vol. I\\" in the library of Charles II. As its publishing history indicates, the play was popular with audiences; it is mentioned by Ben Jonson in the Prologue to his play The Devil is an Ass. While Merry Devil was a King's Men play and Shakespeare may have had a minor role in its creation, it does not have the distinctive marks of Shakespeare's style. Individual 19th-century critics attempted to attribute the play to Michael Drayton or to Thomas Heywood; but their attributions have not been judged credible by other scholars. William Amos Abrams proposed Thomas Dekker as the play's author in his 1942 edition; Dekker scholars Gerald J. Eberle and M. T. Jones-Davies agreed, though Fredson Bowers, the editor of Dekker's Dramatic Works, was unpersuaded by the evidence offered and did not include it in his edition.Logan and Smith, pp. 36‚Äì37, 208‚Äì09. Performance history The play was performed at Court on 8 May 1608; it was also one of the twenty plays that the King's Men acted at Court in the Christmas season of 1612‚Äì13 during the festivities celebrating the wedding of Princess Elizabeth, the daughter of King James I, with Frederick V, Elector Palatine.Chambers, Vol. 4, p. 127. Professional productions in the modern age have been rare, though a radio adaptation was produced by the BBC in 1957, and an original practice performance by Bad Quarto Productions at the 2010 Philadelphia Fringe Festival.

He served as the head football coach at Virginia Tech (1961‚Äì1970), the University of Maryland (1972‚Äì1981), and his alma mater, the University of Kentucky (1982‚Äì1989), compiling a career college football record of 179‚Äì122‚Äì8. Claiborne was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 1999. Early years Claiborne attended the Hopkinsville High School and the University of Kentucky and was named the College of Education's Outstanding Senior. Claiborne played halfback under legendary coach Paul \\"Bear\\" Bryant at the University of Kentucky. In 1950, he became the head football and basketball coach at Augusta Military Academy in Fort Defiance, Augusta County, Virginia. His teams won the Virginia State basketball championship in 1950 and the football championship in 1951. The following year, he left to become Bryant's assistant coach at Kentucky, following Bryant in the same capacity to Texas A&M; and Alabama before he moved up to become a head coach. Head coach Claiborne was head coach for the Virginia Polytechnic Institute from 1961 to 1970 with an overall record of 69‚Äì32‚Äì2. Claiborne's legacy was carried on by Frank Beamer, who played for Claiborne at Virginia Tech. Beamer built the program into a powerhouse in the mid-1990s. Claiborne's contributions to Tech's football program earned him a place in the Virginia Tech Sports Hall of Fame. When Claiborne began coaching at the University of Maryland, the Terrapins had only won nine games in the previous five years. Claiborne led Maryland to a winning season after only his second year with the team. He coached Maryland for ten years and ended with a 77‚Äì37‚Äì3 record, including an undefeated regular season in 1976, before losing to Houston in the 1977 Cotton Bowl Classic. Beginning in 1973, his teams made it to six consecutive bowl games. In 1980, he added one more bowl appearance for a total of seven. Under Claiborne, Maryland won the ACC Championship three times (1974, 1975, and 1976). After the 1981 season at Maryland, Claiborne followed in the footsteps of Bear Bryant and went from College Park, Maryland, to Lexington, Kentucky; the home of the University of Kentucky. In Claiborne's case, Kentucky was his alma mater. UK had just come off four straight losing seasons. They offered Claiborne the head coaching position largely to help clean up a program that had been racked by numerous recruiting violations during the tenure of previous head coach Fran Curci. Claiborne took over as head coach of Kentucky in 1982. After starting with a losing season record of 0‚Äì10‚Äì1, he reached bowl games in his second and third seasons, posting records of 6‚Äì5‚Äì1 in 1983 and 9‚Äì3 in 1984 after which the Wildcats finished the season ranked #19 in the final AP poll. The Wildcats win in the 1984 Hall of Fame Classic over Wisconsin would be the Wildcats' last bowl win until winning the 2006 Music City Bowl over Clemson. Claiborne was never able to put together another winning team, getting no closer than 5‚Äì5‚Äì1 in 1986. However, due in part to his role in cleaning up the program's image, he remained in the good graces of Kentucky fans. Claiborne led the Kentucky program for eight years, ending with an overall record of 41‚Äì46‚Äì3. He retired after posting a 6‚Äì5 record in the 1989 season. In 1992 Claiborne became the head coach of the Braunschweig Lions, and then German Division II Football team in Germany. During his one-year stay he laid the foundation for an organization, that became a European football powerhouse. Significant achievements * Claiborne coached four Academic All-Americans and eighty-seven all-conference academics. * Named the nation's Coach of the Year by the Sporting News in 1974. * Named Southeastern Conference Coach of the Year in 1983. * Claiborne's Kentucky team won the College Football Association Academic Achievement Award for the highest graduation rate of 90% in 1989. * The University of Kentucky named Claiborne into its Alumni Hall of Fame in 1992. * In 1994, Claiborne received the Neyland Trophy, which is presented annually to a coach \\"who has contributed greatly to intercollegiate athletics\\" * In 1999 the Lexington, Kentucky's chapter of the National Football Foundation was named after Claiborne. * Retired with a lifetime record of 179‚Äì122‚Äì8, ranking him fourth among active college coaches in victories when he retired. Famous quote It was Jerry Claiborne who said: \\"Sam Cunningham did more for integration in sixty minutes than Martin Luther King did in twenty years.\\" (After a 1970 42-21 loss in Birmingham to USC, and having Cunningham score two touchdowns and gain 131 yards, the integration of the Alabama football team was accelerated. However, Alabama did have an African-American player on the team at the time in Wilbur Jackson. Like all freshmen at the time, he was ineligible.)

The cartridge presents a simple game of one-on-one basketball playable by one or two players, one of the few early Atari 2600 titles to have a single-player mode with an AI-controlled opponent. Miller wrote a version of Basketball for the Atari 8-bit family with improved graphics, published in 1979. That same year an arcade version similar to the computer port was released by Atari but in black and white. The arcade game was written by Chris Downend. Gameplay Screenshot At the start of the game, both players are at the center of the court. A jump ball is thrown between them to begin play. The player in the offensive position (i.e. in possession of the ball) always faces a basket representing the assigned shooting target, and defensive players always face the opponent. Each player can move in eight directions with the joystick; the player with the ball constantly dribbles it. The defensive player may steal the ball when it leaves the opponent's hands (either in mid-dribble or mid-shot). After either player scores, the shooter is reset to the center of the court and becomes the defensive player (defending the opponent) while the former defender is set under the basket to inbound the ball and take an offensive chance. The player with the highest score after four minutes is the winner. The game features two difficulty levels using the Difficulty Switch on the Atari 2600. In \\"B\\" position, the player can move from goal to goal much more quickly than the \\"A\\" position. Reception In Video magazine's \\"Arcade Alley\\" review column, reviewers described it as \\"that rare game that plays well solitaire or with a human opponent,\\" and noted that \\"the game definitely captures the flavor of basketball.\\" The \\"fan's eye perspective\\" was singled out for particular praise, and the game as a whole was found to \\"offer the most exciting four minutes of one-on-one hoop action [the reviewers had] seen so far.\\" Legacy In the 1980 comedy film Airplane!, flight controllers are seen playing Atari 2600 Basketball rather than watching the monitor.

It is typically found in the forest understory and deposits its eggs on a variety of plants of the genus Passiflora. It is a member of the Heliconiinae subfamily of Central and South America, and it is the only heliconiine that can be considered oligophagous. H. cydno is also characterized by hybridization and M√ºllerian mimicry. Wing coloration plays a key role in mate choice and has further implications in regards to sympatric speciation. Macrolide scent gland extracts and wing- clicking behavior further characterize this species.

Z. Brower. 2008. \\"Heliconius cydno Doubleday 1847\\". The Tree of Life Web Project. Retrieved 4 September 2008. H. cydno is considered to be non-migratory, or sedentary.Brown, K.S. \\"The Biology of Heliconius and Related Genera\\", Annual Review of Entomology 1981, 26:1, (pg. 427-457). H. cydno lives in closed-forest habitats, specifically in the forest understories. They live at elevations from sea level to 2000 meters. Their most common host plants are in the genus Passiflora,Merrill R.M., Naisbit R.E., Mallet J., Jiggins C.D. \\"Ecological and genetic factors influencing the transition between host-use strategies in sympatric Heliconius butterflies\\", Journal of Evolutionary Biology, 2013, vol. 26 (pg. 1959-1967). and at night, adults roost in twigs or tendrils from two to ten meters above the forest floor. Males generally tend to fly higher than females, who are found lower in the forest understory.Underside of wing  Host plant  The diet of H. cydno larva is generalist. Passiflora are less common in the closed-forest habitats of H. cydno, and thus the species uses a wide selection within the genus. They tend to prefer orange and red flowers. Other species of Heliconius restrict their diet to a single species of Passiflora, while H. cydno is oligophagous (feeding on a restricted range of plants). There are records of five species of Passiflora being utilized by H. cydno, all in the subgenera Granadilla, Plectostemma, or Distephana. Both H. cydno and H. melpomene are known to utilize Psiguria warcsewiczii pollen.  Parental care   Oviposition  Experiments performed pertaining to H. cydno oviposition reveal that they utilize chemoreception, not visual cues, when choosing their egg-laying sites.Khuc, Kim. \\"Passiflora (Passifloraceae) defenses against Heliconius cydno (Nymphalidae: Heliconiinae) oviposition\\". Monteverde Institute, May 2000. H. cydno oviposition sites are generally the tendrils of their Passiflora host plants, and eggs are placed singly. While leaf shape experiments and egg mimics do not have significant effects on oviposition, chemical cues from methanol render sites less appealing to H. cydno. Their lack of preference for leaf shape can be attributed to their varied usage of Passiflora hosts. H. cydno also does not participate in larval cannibalism, which plays a role in their indifference to egg mimics.  Life cycle   Egg  The eggs of H. cydno are yellow, 1.1 mm in height and 0.9 mm wide.  Larvae  In the Sch√∂nbrunn Zoo aquarium house Early instar larvae of this species have a white body and black spines. Mature larvae are characterized by an orange head topped by two black horns 1.2 cm long. Their bodies are brownish pink, with black scoli (spines with multiple points) and black spots. The caterpillars of H. cydno are known to form small groups, demonstrating social behavior.  Pupae  Pupae of H. cydno are characterized by antennae, an abdomen with long spines, and a general dark brown color. They have two rectangular gold patches that decorate the thorax.  Adult  Adults have forewings and hindwings which are black with either yellow or white bands/spots. Their hindwings have bars on their ventral surface, distinguishing themselves from mimics. Wing coloration is dependent on location.  Protective coloration and behavior   M√ºllerian mimicry  H. cydno engages in the predator defense mechanism of M√ºllerian mimicry with H. eleuchia (specifically in Ecuador) and H. sapho by adopting colors that warn a predator of their bad taste, deterring attacks. For instance, H. cydno alithea, which has two potential colorings, mimics H. eleuchia in its yellow form, and mimics H. sapho in its white form. In contrast, H. cydno close relative, H. melpomene, mimics H. erato.Kronforst M. R., Papa R. (2015). \\"The functional basis of wing patterning in Heliconius butterflies: The molecules behind mimicry\\". Genetics, 200, 1‚Äì19.  Genetics   Hybridization  It is a species well known and widely researched for its tendency to hybridize with the closely related H. melpomene, from which it diverged around 1.5 million years ago. They are sympatric for much of the geographic range of H. cydno, from Central America to northern South America, and exhibit a low level of hybridization and gene flow in nature.Russell E. Naisbit, Chris D. Jiggins, James Mallet. \\"Disruptive sexual selection against hybrids contributes to speciation between Heliconius cydno and Heliconius melpomene\\". Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B. 2001 268 1849-1854; . Published 7 September 2001. Hybrids between the two species occur at a frequency of less than 0.1%. Their low levels of hybridization can, in part, be attributed to pre-mating isolation, as H. melpone is found in more open habitats, while H. cydno lives in a closed-forest environment.Estrada C, Jiggins CD. 2002 \\"Patterns of pollen feeding and habitat preference among Heliconius species\\". Ecological Entomology. 27, 448‚Äì456. Studies suggest that changes in host use and mimicry in H. melpomene and H. cydno are genetically determined and may contribute to pre-mating isolation. In the past, this likely contributed to speciation. H. pachinus is also known to hybridize with H. melpomene. The fact that both species hybridize with H. melpomene is considered significant because H. melpomene exhibits a distinct pheromonal chemistry and coloring.Schulz, Stefan, et al. \\"Macrolides from the scent glands of the tropical butterflies Heliconius cydno and Heliconius pachinus\\". Organic and Bimolecular Chemistry, 2007. In fact, it has been suggested that wing preference patterns in mating may limit hybridization, a preference which is also known to limit hybridization between H. cydno and H. pachinus, which is another closely related species. Thus, divergent coloring (and therefore, mimicry), contributes to sympatric speciation. While hybridization of species is present, there is evidence to suggest that hybrids are less successful in mating than their non-hybrid counterparts. Hybrids will mate with one another; however, their mating success is 50% of that of their parents, demonstrating disruptive sexual selection against these hybrids that helps to maintain the two species as separate, sympatric species.  Color patterns  There are four key loci that affect wing color and pattern in H. cydno. L determines whether a given individual has melanic scales over their forewing band. The Sb and Yb loci are tightly linked in H. cydno, although the exact distance is not known. The Sb locus controls for the white submarginal band on the hindwing. The allele for the band is recessive. The Yb locus controls for a yellow band on the hindwing. The allele for this yellow band is also recessive. The K locus determines whether the medial band on the forewing, dorsally and ventrally, is yellow or white. An additional locus, G, determines the red line located on the forewing, at the base of the costal vein.Merch√°n HA, Jiggins CD, Linares M (2005) \\"A narrow Heliconius cydno (Nymphalidae; Heliconiini) hybrid zone with differences in morph sex ratios\\". Biotropica, 37, 119‚Äì128.  Mating   Coloration  It has been determined, based on crosses performed between H. cydno and H. melpomene, as well as between H. cydno and H. pachinus, that there are specific linkage groups associated with both male preference and female mating outcome (red verses black in cydno/melpomene crosses and white verses yellow in cydno/pachinus crosses). Strong linkage can be seen between mate preference and dominant wing color at the locus that controls forewing coloration.Merrill, R. M., Van Schooten, B., Scott, J. A., Jiggins, C. D. \\"Pervasive genetic associations between traits causing reproductive isolation in Heliconius butterflies\\". Proceedings of the Royal Society B. 278, 511‚Äì518 (2011). This contributes to co-evolution of mimicry and mate preference while maintaining the association of different species.  Iridescence and light polarization  Wing iridescence is another factor in H. cydno mating. Heliconius butterflies in general use thin-film iridescence and polarized light for mate recognition. H. cydno has blue iridescence which, at some angles, is 90% polarized. In experiments investigating polarized light as a signal in mating, it was found that when a female's wings were shown behind a depolarizing filter, she was approached at a significantly lower rate than when her wings were shown behind a non- depolarizing filter. It has been suggested that the high degree of iridescence displayed by H. cydno can be attributed to their forest understory habitat, which generally has less-direct sunlight.Sweeney A, Jiggins C, Johnsen S (2003) \\"Polarized light as a butterfly mating signal\\". Nature 423:31‚Äì32.  Multiple matings  H. cydno females are known to mate multiply, thus engaging in polyandry. There are many possible benefits to females mating multiply that may conclude more robust progeny, more allocation of resources, or other benefits.  Physiology   Macrolide scent gland extracts  Research done on H. cydno in Costa Rica suggests that the species has 12- and 14-membered macrolide scent gland extracts which have a C-18 skeleton. They are derived from linolenic, linoleic, and oleic acids and have an S configuration. According to the study, other species' desire and ability to hybridize with H. cydno was not affected by their possession of macrolide scent gland extracts.  Social behavior  In an experiment by Mirian Medina Hay-Roe and Richard W. Mankin, field-collected H. cydno females were found to produce wing clicks when interacting with members of the same species. Wing clicks are made in short sequences of three to ten clicks, at a speed of approximately ten clicks per second. They demonstrated this behavior during the day and at roosting time, when individuals came close to one another so as to almost touch one another's head or wings. This behavior was also observed during aggressive interactions with H. erato females. When an experimental group of H. cydno were moved to a greenhouse and allowed to reproduce, the first generation of adults born in the greenhouses did not demonstrate wing- clicking behavior. The frequency of wing clicking peaked at 1075 Hz, which is close to the 1200-Hz frequency peak of auditory sensitivity in H. erato. This further suggests that communication both between and within species may be facilitated through this behavior.R.W. Mankin, MM Hay-Roe, \\"Wing-click sounds of Heliconius cydno alithea (Nymphalidae: Heliconiinae) butterflies\\", Journal of Insect Behavior, vol. 17, no. 3, pp. 664-674, 2004.

It is found along the Pacific coast of North America, from the U.S. state of Oregon to Mazatl√°n in Mexico. Typically measuring 1.2‚Äì1.5 m (3.9‚Äì4.9 ft) long, this slender-bodied shark is immediately identifiable by the striking pattern of black saddle-like markings and large spots over its back, from which it derives its common name. Large schools of leopard sharks are a common sight in bays and estuaries, swimming over sandy or muddy flats or rock-strewn areas near kelp beds and reefs. They are most common near the coast, in water less than 4 m (13 ft) deep. Active-swimming predators, groups of leopard sharks often follow the tide onto intertidal mudflats to forage for food, mainly clams, spoon worms, crabs, shrimp, bony fish, and fish eggs. Most leopard sharks tend to remain within a particular area rather than undertaking long movements elsewhere, which has led to genetic divergence between populations of sharks living in different regions. This species is aplacental viviparous, meaning that the young hatch inside the uterus and are nourished by yolk. From March to June, the female gives birth to as many as 37 young after a gestation period of 10‚Äì12 months. It is relatively slow-growing and takes many years to mature. Harmless to humans, the leopard shark is caught by commercial and recreational fisheries for food and the aquarium trade. This species is mostly fished in the waters off California where, after a period of population decline in the 1980s, new fishing regulations in the early 1990s reduced harvesting to sustainable levels. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed this species as of Least Concern, while noting that local stocks may easily become overfished because of the shark's slow growth and limited migratory habits. Taxonomy and phylogeny The first scientific name applied to the leopard shark was Triakis californica, coined by British zoologist John Edward Gray in the 1851 List of the specimens of fish in the collection of the British Museum. However, Gray did not furnish the name with a proper description, rendering it a nomen nudum. In December 1854, American ichthyologist William Orville Ayres gave a lecture describing the species as Mustelus felis, which included the first scientific description of the species. His lecture was reprinted first in The Pacific, a San Francisco newspaper, and then in the journal Proceedings of the California Academy of Natural Sciences. In April 1855, French biologist Charles Fr√©d√©ric Girard published another description of this species, naming it Triakis semifasciata. Despite M. felis being the senior synonym, an error in recording the dates of publication resulted in the widespread use of T. semifasciata as the leopard shark's scientific name. As a result of this long-standing error, Triakis semifasciata came to be recognized as the valid name (as a nomen protectum) and Mustelis felis was invalidated (as a nomen oblitum). The specific epithet semifasciata comes from the Latin words semi (\\"half\\") and fasciatus (\\"banded\\"), describing this shark's dorsal pattern of saddle-like markings. In older literature, this species may be referred to as \\"tiger shark\\" or \\"catshark\\". The genus Triakis contains two subgenera, Triakis and Cazon. The leopard shark is placed within the subgenus Triakis along with the banded houndshark (T. (Triakis) scyllium). A 2006 phylogenetic analysis by J. Andr√©s L√≥pez and colleagues, based on protein-coding genes, revealed that Triakis and Cazon are in fact not closely related, and additionally that the leopard shark may be the most basal member of its family. Distribution and habitat The leopard shark is often found over sandy flats. The leopard shark occurs in the Northeastern Pacific Ocean, from the temperate continental waters of Coos Bay, Oregon to the tropical waters of Mazatl√°n, Mexico, including the Gulf of California. It favors muddy or sandy flats within enclosed bays and estuaries, and may also be encountered near kelp beds and rocky reefs, or along the open coast. Numbers have been known to gather near discharges of warm effluent from power plants. Leopard sharks generally swim close to the bottom and are most abundant from the intertidal zone to a depth of , though they may be found as deep as . Many leopard sharks, particularly in the north, leave their coastal habitats in winter and return in early spring. A study in Tomales Bay in northern California determined that they depart when the water temperature drops below 10-12 ¬∞C (50-54 ¬∞F); one tagged shark was found to have swum some south. While a few leopard sharks have been documented traveling hundreds of kilometers, most individuals tend to remain in a localized area for much of their lives. This low level of dispersal has led to genetic divergence across its range. Seven discrete gene pools have been identified along the Californian coast between Humboldt Bay and San Diego. Of these, the Humboldt Bay subpopulation is perhaps the most isolated, with the sharks there maturing at a larger size and producing fewer offspring than those from other areas. By contrast, the area around Los Angeles represents a genetic transitional zone between subpopulations whose boundaries are more diffuse. Off Baja California, the leopard sharks on the Pacific side are probably distinct from those in the northern Gulf of California. Although there is equivocal evidence for natal philopatry (returning to one's birthplace to breed) in this species, proximity to established breeding grounds likely contributes to the structuring of these different subpopulations. Description The leopard shark has a moderately stout body, with a short, rounded snout. There are well-developed, triangular flaps of skin in front of the nares. The eyes are large and oval, with a nictitating membrane (a protective third eyelid). The line of the mouth is strongly curved. There are furrows at the corners of the mouth extending onto both jaws, with those on the lower jaw almost long enough to meet at the midline. The tooth rows number 41-55 in the upper jaw and 34-45 in the lower jaw; each tooth has a slightly oblique, smooth-edged cusp in the center and 1-2 small cusplets on either side. These teeth are arranged into a flat, \\"pavement\\"-like surface with overlapping ridges.Delius, B. Biological Profiles: Leopard Shark. Florida Museum of Natural History Ichthyology Department. Retrieved on August 9, 2009. The large first dorsal fin is positioned about halfway between the pectoral and pelvic fins; the second is almost as large as the first and much larger than the anal fin. The pectoral fins are wide and triangular. The lower lobe of the caudal fin is well-developed in adults but less than half the length of the upper lobe, which has a strong ventral notch near the tip. The coloration is unique, consisting of prominent black \\"saddles\\" and large black spots running along the back, on a silvery to bronzy gray background. Adult sharks often have more spots and saddles with lighter centers compared to juveniles. The underside is whitish and plain. The average length of a leopard shark is . Rarely males may grow to and females , and there is a record of an exceptional female that measured long. The heaviest known leopard shark weighed .

An active species that swims with a strong undulating motion, the leopard shark is commonly spotted cruising in or just beyond the surf zone. It is more active at night than during the day, and sometimes lies still on the bottom. In Tomales Bay and elsewhere, the leopard shark follows the tide onto mudflats to forage for food, retreating just fast enough to prevent being stranded or trapped as the water recedes. At Santa Catalina Island, resident sharks spend the day together in the shallows and at night disperse into deeper water, ranging up to away.Manley, J.F. (1995). Diel movement patterns of leopard sharks, Triakis semifasciata, at Santa Catalina Island, California. MS Thesis. California State University, Long Beach, CA. From birth, leopard sharks form large schools generally segregated by age and sex, which may intermingle with grey or brown smoothhounds (Mustelus californicus and M. henlei) or spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias). These schools are apparently nomadic, often appearing suddenly in an area for a few hours and then vanishing just as quickly. In captivity, larger sharks have been observed establishing their dominance over smaller individuals via light nips to the pectoral fins. During summer days, large aggregations of mature females assemble in shallow bays and estuaries, dispersing at night. As these females follow the warmest patches of water, allowing them to raise their internal body temperatures by up to 3 ¬∞C (5.4 ¬∞F), they are speculated to be taking advantage of the heat to speed their growth and that of their gestating young. The membership of these aggregations is inconstant, with individual females periodically switching between different sites scattered over several kilometers. Compared to the related grey and brown smoothhounds that share its range, the leopard shark has smaller and more numerous red blood cells, allowing it to process oxygen more efficiently. This may be an adaptation for foraging in deoxygenated estuary environments.Martin, R.A. Estuaries: Leopard Shark. ReefQuest Centre for Shark Research. Retrieved on August 9, 2009. Their eyes contain very few cone cells, likely due to the murky water they inhabit. Small leopard sharks fall prey to larger sharks such as the great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias) and the broadnose sevengill shark (Notorynchus cepedianus). On one occasion, a sevengill shark was seen ambushing a leopard shark on a tidal mudflat in Humboldt Bay, striking with such momentum that the larger predator momentarily beached itself.Martin, R.A. Sandy Plains: Broadnose Sevengill Shark. ReefQuest Centre for Shark Research. Retrieved on August 9, 2009. Known parasites of this species include the tapeworms Phyllobothrium riseri, Lacistorhynchus dollfusi and Paraorygmatobothrium barber, as well as the copepods Echthrogaleus eoleoptratus and Achtheinus oblongatus. Feeding The leopard shark captures prey with a combination of suction and biting. The diet of the leopard shark consists of small benthic and littoral animals, most significantly crabs (Cancridae, Grapsidae, and Hippoidea), shrimp, bony fish (including anchovies, herring, topsmelt, croakers, surfperch, gobies, rockfish, sculpins, flatfish, and midshipmen), fish eggs, clams, and the echiurid fat innkeeper worm (Urechis caupo). This opportunistic hunter has also been known to eat ghost shrimp, polychaete worms, and the young of smoothhounds, shovelnose guitarfish (Rhinobatos productus), and bat rays (Myliobatis californicus). Eelgrass (Zostera) and algae may be swallowed incidentally. The leopard shark captures prey by expanding its buccal cavity to create a suction force, which is facilitated by its labial cartilages swinging forward to form the mouth into a tube. Simultaneously, the shark protrudes its jaws forward to grip the prey between its teeth. As with other sharks, the teeth of the leopard shark are periodically shed and replaced; it takes 9-12 days for a replacement tooth to move into position. Leopard sharks have been caught with stomachs filled with clam siphons, which the sharks seize before the clams can retract and break off with a levering motion of their bodies. On occasion, the shark tears the entire clam body out of its shell this way. Other sharks examined have had stomachs containing whole innkeeper worms with no bite marks, suggesting that the sharks sucked them out of their burrows. Under a hollow bridge support in San Francisco Bay, a group of leopard sharks and spiny dogfish have been observed feeding on a dense school of anchovies by slowly swimming counterclockwise through the clockwise-swimming school, and swallowing any anchovies that accidentally entered their open mouths. In some places, this species feeds only on a few prey types and little else (e.g. innkeeper worms and cancrid crabs in Tomales Bay, jack silverside (Atherinopsis californiensis) eggs and the crabs Romaleon antennarium and Metacarcinus magister in Humboldt Bay). The predominant prey taken depends on location, time of year, and age. For example, in the Elkhorn Slough at Monterey Bay, cancrid crabs and innkeeper worms are mostly eaten in winter and spring, fish eggs from winter to early summer, bony fish in summer, and grapsid crabs and clams in fall. Young sharks feed mostly on crabs and transition to clam siphons, fish eggs, and innkeeper worms once they reach long. The largest sharks are the ones that consume the most fish. Life history Young leopard sharks frequent very shallow, coastal waters. The leopard shark is aplacental viviparous, with the developing embryos sustained by a yolk sac until birth. In northern areas, females use bays and sloughs as nursery areas, while to the south they give birth in more open areas. Known breeding grounds along the coast of California include Humboldt Bay, Tomales Bay, Bodega Bay, San Francisco Bay, Elkhorn Slough, Morro Bay, Santa Monica Bay (Los Angeles), Catalina Harbor (Santa Catalina Island), and San Diego Bay. Females give birth to 1-37 young annually from March and July (most in April or May), with the number of pups increasing with female size. Multiple males may father a litter from a single motherhttps://www.nbcnews.com/sciencemain/one-female-sharks- litter-may-have-many-dads-study-finds-6C10848675 In Humboldt and San Francisco Bays, females drop their pups in beds of eelgrass that provide both shelter and food. In Catalina Harbor, females give birth on flats in of water, their backs and dorsal fins exposed; the pups stay in even shallower water less than deep. Mating occurs in early summer following birth; the only known observation of this in the wild was in 2004 off La Jolla, amongst nine sharks gathered from shore in water deep.Smith, S.E. (2004). \\"Leopard Shark (Triakis semifasciata) Mating Activity Observed off La Jolla, California\\". Southwest Fisheries Science Center, San Diego. Note. Newborn leopard sharks measure around long. Relatively slow-growing after the first 3-4 years of life, male leopard sharks grow an average of per year, reaching maturity at an age of 7-13 years and a length of , while females grow an average of per year, reaching maturity at an age of 10-15 years and a length of . Individuals of the same age can vary significantly in size and large sharks are especially slow-growing: one specimen was documented to have gained only in length over 12 years. The maximum lifespan of this species is estimated to be 30 years. Human interactions A leopard shark at the Monterey Bay Aquarium; this species adapts well to captivity. Wary and quick to flee, leopard sharks pose almost no danger to humans. There is a single record from 1955 of a leopard shark harassing a skin diver with a nosebleed, though no injuries resulted. This species is caught by commercial fisheries using gillnets and longlines, and by recreational anglers and spearfishers; it is also caught as bycatch in bottom trawls. The meat is considered excellent eating and is sold fresh or frozen. However, leopard sharks living alongside human development may accumulate pollutants such as mercury, pesticides, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) within their bodies, and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife warns against eating them regularly. The leopard shark is prized by the aquarium trade for its attractive appearance and hardiness; this led to many newborn pups being captured with hook-and-line off southern California in the late 1980s and early 1990s. It may live for over 20 years in captivity. Most of the fishing for leopard sharks occurs in the waters off California, where commercial landings peaked at in 1983 and has averaged annually since 1991. These figures are believed to be underestimates, as an unknown portion of the leopard shark catch is recorded simply as \\"shark\\". In recent decades the number of sharks taken recreationally has exceeded those taken commercially, with sport fishers catching an average of 52,000 sharks per year from 1980-1988, and 45,000 sharks per year since 1993. This species contributes negligibly to fishery landings off Oregon. The status of leopard sharks off Mexico is uncertain, although Mexican shark fisheries tend to focus more on larger species. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the leopard shark as of Least Concern. It is highly susceptible to local depletion due to its slow growth rate and low level of exchange between regional stocks. It was considered for, but is not managed under, the U.S. Pacific Fishery Management Council's (PMC) 1982 Groundfish Management Plan. In 1992, the State of California imposed a recreational minimum size limit of and a possession limit of three fish, a move that was strongly supported and promoted by the sport fishing community. In 1993, the State also instituted a minimum size limit of for the commercial harvesting of all sharks and rays, including for the aquarium trade. In addition, Californian restrictions on the use of certain types of fishing gear in near- shore waters confer good protection to this shark's core population. These management measures seem to have successfully reduced fishing mortality and halted the population decline from the 1980s; the status of the leopard shark off California is regarded as secure, with demographic models estimating an annual population increase of 3-6% with sustainable fishing.

It was recorded between December 1979 and July 1980, and was released on 3 November 1980 by record label 4AD, the first full-length release on that label.http://www.4ad.com/releases/5 The album is considered one of the first gothic rock records.  Recording  Following a 30-date tour, Bauhaus went to Southern Studios in London to record their first album. The band had a clear conception of how they wanted the record to sound; hence, they opted to produce it themselves. While most of the album was completed with the planned release date of September 1980, the group found it difficult to record a version of \\"Double Dare\\" as good as the one they performed on disc jockey John Peel's BBC Radio 1 programme. Bauhaus applied to the BBC to use the Peel sessions version, but due to obstruction from the Musicians Union, the process took over a month. Music NMEs Andy Gill wrote that the dark atmosphere of the record was reminiscent of previous works by groups including Siouxsie and the Banshees, Adam and the Ants, and Joy Division. In his AllMusic review, critic Ned Raggett described Bauhaus as a \\"glam-inspired rock band\\", said that singer Peter Murphy channeled both Iggy Pop and David Bowie, and compared Daniel Ash's guitar playing to that of Mick Ronson. Raggett noted that the album concluded with \\"a dramatic ending\\" with the song \\"Nerves\\".  Release  In the Flat Field was released on 3 November 1980 by record label 4AD. It was met with a negative response from critics, but topped the UK Independent Albums Chart and made the UK Albums Chart for one week, peaking at No. 72. The album was first released on CD by 4AD in April 1988, with eight bonus tracks including three non-album singles: \\"Dark Entries\\", \\"Terror Couple Kill Colonel\\" and a cover of T. Rex's \\"Telegram Sam\\". Five of these bonus tracks had been previously compiled on the 4AD EP in 1983. On 19 October 2009, 4AD/Beggars Banquet reissued the album as an \\"Omnibus Edition\\", featuring the 24-bit John Dent remastered CD of the original nine-track album in a replica mini-LP sleeve (with corresponding inner sleeve featuring the lyrics), plus a 16-track bonus disc of singles, outtakes, alternate recordings and original versions. The set came inside a semi-long box, coupled with a 48-page book that included comments from band members, photos, complete lyrics, complete tour date information for 1979 and 1980, and an essay by Andrew Brooksbank on the formation and creation of the band, the singles and the album.  Critical reception  While In the Flat Field received positive reviews in fanzine publications, the album was \\"absolutely slated\\" by the British weekly music press, according to Bauhaus biographer Ian Shirley. NME described the album as \\"nine meaningless moans and flails bereft of even the most cursory contour of interest, a record which deserves all the damning adjectives usually leveled at grim-faced 'modernists'.\\" Reviewer Andy Gill then ultimately dismissed them as \\"a hip Black Sabbath\\". Dave McCullough of Sounds was also negative: \\"No songs. Just tracks (ugh). Too priggish and conceited. Sluggish indulgence instead of hoped for goth-ness. Coldly catatonic.\\" The American Trouser Press, however, described it as \\"a dense, disjointed patchwork of sounds and uncertain feelings, supported by a pressured, incessant beat. Delving deep into the dark side of the human psyche, Bauhaus conjures up unsettling images of a world given over to death and decay.\\" In his AllMusic retrospective review, Raggett praised the album, writing \\"few debut albums ever arrived so nearly perfectly formed\\". while Treblezine described the songs as \\"twisted, glam-inspired post-punk raveups\\". Jonathan Selzer of Classic Rock magazine described the album as \\"remarkably self-possessed, a distillation of influences down to a potent curtains-drawn universe of Bauhaus's own.\\"  Legacy  AllMusic's Raggett wrote: \\"In the Flat Field practically single- handedly invented what remains for many as the stereotype of goth music‚Äîwracked, at times spindly vocals about despair and desolation of many kinds, sung over mysterious and moody music\\". In 2012, Sonic Seducer listed In the Flat Field at No. 4 in its list of \\"10 Key Albums for the Gothic Scene\\", calling it a work that had shattered outdated ideas of rock music. Music author Dave Thompson described it as \\"one of the most courageous albums of the age.\\" Louder than War noted it as \\"a staple record for the true post-punk scene\\".

The league was founded in 1911 as the Beaches Hockey League by Fred C. Waghorne, Sr., and it is the largest minor hockey organization in the world. The league is sanctioned by the Ontario Hockey Federation and Hockey Canada. History Early years The Greater Toronto Hockey League was founded in 1911 by Frank D. Smith. Its first season consisted of 5 teams and 99 players. Smith was 17 years old when he founded the organization, and would continue to oversee the operation for 50 years. He was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1962 in part for his contributions to minor hockey in Toronto. The League's name underwent several changes over its history. Originally called the Beaches League, it was renamed to the Toronto Hockey League (THL) shortly after its inception. It was renamed again in 1972 to the Metropolitan Toronto Hockey League before settling on the current Greater Toronto Hockey League moniker in 1998. The League saw increases in membership during its first few years. During World War I, the then THL maintained its numbers due to having younger age divisions, such as peewee and bantam, where the players were too young to participate in the war. By the 1960s, The league had over 20,000 members on teams across Toronto. The GTHL In 2011, the Greater Toronto Hockey League and its affiliates consisted of 2,800 teams and around 40,000 players. It is currently the largest youth ice hockey organization in the world in terms of members. The league has expanded its area of operation over the years from primarily the city of Toronto to many of its surrounding municipalities. Currently, there are 51 separate associations that operate under the GTHL. These associations provide teams for the various age groups and divisions that make up the league. Around 275 GTHL alumni have gone on to play in North American professional ice hockey leagues, such as the National Hockey League and the defunct World Hockey Association. The GTHL is a not-for-profit organization, however its operating costs are high. In 2011, league expenses were in excess of $9 million per year. The high costs of operating teams has been an issue for the league, with some teams having trouble paying for the increasing costs of ice in the Toronto area. The costs for someone to play on a AAA GTHL team, its highest level of play, is approximately $6,000 per player. In 2011, the GTHL along with Hockey Canada changed its rules regarding hits to the head. Stricter rules were placed on what constituted a hit to the head, and the severity of punishment for instances of it was increased.

Levels of play The GTHL runs competitive leagues at the \\"rep\\" levels (AAA, AA, and A), as well as coordinating several affiliates to operate \\"Select\\" leagues throughout the city. Rep hockey in the GTHL begins at \\"minor Atom\\" (U9) age and continues through U21. House League and Select programs include children of all ages, extending from Timbits (3 or 4 years of age) all the way to U21. All hockey is played under \\"Hockey Canada\\" rules. There is no body checking allowed at all age groups for \\"select\\" and rep \\"A\\" level in the GTHL and affiliates. Body checking is permitted for minor bantam (U13) and above for the rep \\"AA\\" and rep \\"AAA\\" levels.

Constantin investigates whether repetition is possible, and the book includes his experiments and his relation to a nameless patient known only as the Young Man.This Young Man is most likely taken from Johann Goethe's novel Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship and Travels Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship and Travels Carlyle's translation 1824, 1871 Wilhelm wanted to go to plays all the time The Young Man has fallen in love with a girl, proposed marriage, the proposal has been accepted, but now he has changed his mind.Repetition p. 131, 133-136 Constantin becomes the young man's confidant. Coincidentally, the problem that the Young Man had is the same problem Kierkegaard had with Regine Olsen. He had proposed to her, she had accepted but he had changed his mind. Kierkegaard was accused of \\"experimenting with the affections of his fianc√©e\\".see pages p.8-12 and 21-24 for information about Regine and Quotes from Repetition. S√∏ren Kierkegaard, by David F.

Bellinger says Either/Or, Fear and Trembling and Repetition are works of fiction, \\"novelistic\\" in character; they focus on the boundaries between different spheres of existence, such as the aesthetic and the ethical, and the ethical and the religious; they often focus on the subject of marriage; they can be traced back to Kierkegaard's relationship with Regine.\\"A Very Short Life of Kierkegaard, by Charles K. Bellinger There is much in this work that is autobiographical in nature. How much is left up to the reader. Kierkegaard explores the conscious choices this Young Man makes.Repetition p. 228-229 He had written about repetition previously in his unpublished book Johannes Climacus. Kierkegaard published Fear and Trembling, Three Upbuilding Discourses, 1843 and Repetition all on the same date, October 16, 1843. Abraham was the main character in Fear and Trembling and the Three Upbuilding Discourses were about love. Repetition presents a noticeable contrast between the other two books that is almost comical. He takes up the idea of repetition again in his 1844 work The Concept of AnxietyThe Concept of Anxiety, Nichol p. 15-21, 34-35, 90-95 where he explores the concepts of sin and guilt more directly.

During his conversation with the Young Man he comes to understand that he is in love but he talks about his love as though it were just a memory. He says the Young Man \\"was deeply and fervently in love, that was clear, and yet a few days later he was able to recollect his love.

I did not learn it from her directly, but she was the occasion.\\" Journals IXA 18 that awakened the poetic in him and made him a poet.\\"Repetition p.138 He calls him the \\"sorrowful knight of recollection‚Äôs only happy love.\\"Repetition p. 146 He has had his first love but that's not anywhere near the experience of marriage. Kierkegaard says the following in Either/Or, \\"The question, namely, is this: Can this love be actualized? After having conceded everything up to this point, you perhaps will say: Well, it is just as difficult to actualize marriage as to actualize first love. To that I must respond: No, for in marriage there is a law of motion. First love remains an unreal in itself that never acquires inner substance because it moves only in the external medium. In the ethical and religious intention, marital love has the possibility of an inner history and is as different from first love as the historical is from the unhistorical. This love is strong, stronger than the whole world, but the moment it doubts it is annihilated; it is like a sleepwalker who is able to walk in the most dangerous places with the complete security but plunges down when someone calls his name. Marital love is armed, for in the intention not only is attentiveness directed to the surrounding world but the will is directed toward itself, toward the inner world.\\"Either/Or Part II p. 94 The Young Man, like Byron, \\"declares that love is heaven and marriage hell.\\" Either/Or Part II p. 22 Constantin, \\"the aesthetic schemer\\",Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments Volume I, by Johannes Climacus, edited by S√∏ren Kierkegaard, Copyright 1846 ‚Äì Edited and Translated by Howard V.

Kierkegaard wrote humorously about the idea of repetition in Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments, he said,  Repetition  Constantin is still pursuing repetition. Now he's seeking a \\"sameness that has a far more anesthetic power than the most whimsical amusements\\"Repetition p.179 when he gets a letter from the Young Man demanding that he keep \\"unbroken silence\\" about the whole affair he was speaking to him about and that he will not be seeing him anymore. He will correspond by mail only. Constantin says, \\"This, then, is the thanks one gets for having trained oneself every day for years to have only an objective theoretical interest in people, in everyone for whom the idea is in motion! At one time, I tried to assist the idea in him; now I am reaping the harvest, namely, I am supposed to be and also not to be both being and nothing, entirely as he so pleases, and not to receive the slightest appreciation for being able to be that and thereby to help him out of the contradiction.\\"Repetition p. 180-181 He continues to diagnose him. The Young Man tells him he will be going to Job for help and will write his reports to Constantin.Repetition p. 186-187  Letters from the Young Man, August 15 ‚Äì May 31  \\"Two years after the death of his father, in the year 1840, S√∏ren Kierkegaard entered into an engagement of marriage with a young girl living in Copenhagen, whose name was Regine Olsen. However, he was very soon brought to the insight that no marriage was possible for him. He sought to break the engagement, but succeeded only in stirring the heart of his fianc√© to a passionate outburst, in which she begged him not to leave her. Moved profoundly by the ardor of her love he sought to emancipate her and himself through the adoption of a very involved and curious method.\\"Lectures on the Religious Thought of S√∏ren Kierkegaard, Eduard Geismar, Augsburg Publishing Co 1937 p. 4-5 see also p. 35-42 that method was to become the Seducer in Either/Or Part I Journal entries seem to indicate that Kierkegaard was wary of marriage as early as 1838Journals & Papers of S√∏ren Kierkegaard IIA 11 August 1838 http://www.naturalthinker.net/trl/texts/Kierkegaard,Soren/JournPapers/II_A.html and that he had a definite reason for breaking off the engagement.Journals & Papers of S√∏ren Kierkegaard IIIA 166 Did he use the method endorsed by Constantin and become a deceiver?Lectures on the Religious Thought of S√∏ren Kierkegaard p. 4-10 The letters from the Young Man are either written in relation to Regine or they are a passionate cry for freedom.

Must he keep his pledge because the social order demands that he does it?Concluding Unscientific Postscript p. 266 First he blames his psychologist but he still needs him. Existential philosophy calls this Ressentiment. Then he blames the girl.Elihu, who rises up with renewed vigor when the others are tired out, present versions of the theme that his calamity is a punishment; he must repent, beg forgiveness, and then all will be well again. Meanwhile, Job holds fast to his interpretation. His position is like a permit by which he departs from the world and men. It is a claim that men do not acknowledge, but still Job does not renounce it. ... But this does not influence his friends, they insist that he must see punishment in this. Repetition, pp. 208‚Äì209 ordeal as Job but neither of them is a Knight of Faith. Repetition, pp. 209‚Äì210 Then he appeals to Job. Later, in Edifying Discourses in Various Spirits (1847), Kierkegaard discusses Job's guilt again. \\"Job‚Äôs friends did not have any criteria for what it means to suffer as one who is innocent before God. The highest that the Jews knew was a piety such as Job‚Äôs, and this is why it was doubly arrogant and doubly unjust of the friends to speak in this way of Job. The Christian, however, knows that there is only one, but also that there is one, who suffered before God as innocent. No one dares to compare himself to him or measure himself by his standard; between him and every human between there is an eternal difference. That is why it now applies with renewed clarity that in relation to God a human being always suffers as guilty.\\"Edifying Discourses in Various Spirits (1847) Hong p. 183-188 Then he questions his own existence and the concept of guilt. Existential philosophers call this an existential crisis. Then he demands his rights. Kierkegaard is developing his concept of individuality. The Young Man wants to stand out from the crowd and make his own decisions about his own life. His question is never what is love, but how do I know I'm in love, how do you know you're in love? Too many people want to read about love in order to find out what love is. Kierkegaard says one must act, not just think about acting. His letter dated January 13 states he is now married and doing his best to be a husband.Repetition p. 114-115 Contrasting Abraham in Fear and Trembling with the Young Man creates an excellent comedy when taken together.Kierkegaard illustrated the contrast in his introduction to The Concept of Anxiety - note pages 16-19 http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/dk/kierkega.htm Abraham wasn't anxious about the social order, he just followed God but the Young Man is overflowing with anxiety about what his friends will say about him, and he followed Job. Kierkegaard wrote in Fear and Trembling: \\"It would be altogether desirable if esthetics would sometime attempt to begin where for so many years it has ended-in the illusion of magnanimity. As soon as it did this, it would be working hand in hand with the religious, for this is the only power that can rescue the esthetic from its battle with the ethical.\\"Fear and Trembling p. 93 Kierkegaard says, \\"I perceived that he was a poet-if for no other reason I saw it in the fact that a situation that would have been taken easily in stride by a lesser mortal expanded into a world event for him.\\"Repetition p. 230 On December 6, 1843 Kierkegaard published his Four Upbuilding Discourses, he explains this Young Man's relation to Job in the following way, > In tempestuous times, when the foundation of existence is tottering, when > the moment shivers in anxious expectancy of what may come, when every > explanation falls silent at the spectacle of the wild tumult, when a > person‚Äôs innermost being groans in despair and in ‚Äúbitterness of soul‚Äù cries > to heaven, then Job still walks along, at the generation‚Äôs side and > guarantees that there is a victory, guarantees that even if the single > individual loses in the struggle, there is still a God who, just as he > proportions every temptation humanly, even though the person did not > withstand the temptation, will still make a way out such as he can bear it ‚Äì > yes, even more gloriously than any human expectancy.

(Job 1:20-21) p. 111  Incidental Observations by Constantin Constantius  Constantin has renounced all theorizing but still thinks about the Young Man and the girl. As far as he's concerned the Young Man is a poet.Either/Or Part 1 p. 19 He says, \\"A poet seems to be born to be a fool for the girls. If a girl made a fool of him to his face, he would think of it generous of her.\\"Repetition p. 217 The Young Man writes once more, on May 31, to let Constantin know that the \\"girl\\" is married. Kierkegaard-The Young Man says, > \\"I belong to the idea.

Kierkegaard calls the Young Man's behaviour criminal.Concluding Unscientific Postscript p. 265-267  Concluding Letter by Constantin Constantius, Copenhagen, August 1843  Constantin addresses his readers.Repetition p. 225-227 He says,  Criticism  August Strindberg referred to Kierkegaard in his book To Damascus (1900). Part 1 is compared to \\"Kierkegaard's Gentagelse\\" by Gunnar Ollen who translated the book. The Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics, 1915, had a short article about S√∏ren Kierkegaard. They wrote, > In Gentagelsen (' Repetition,' October 1843), Kierkegaard sketches an > abortive transition to the religious sphere. 'Repetition' is one of his > characteristic ideas; it signifies persistence in, and faithfulness to, a > chosen course of life, and is thus opposed to the (esthetic standpoint, with > constancy only in change. But Kierkegaard also gives the word a more special > meaning‚Äîthat rather of 'resumption' (Gentagelse, 'taking again')‚Äîimplying > that each higher stage of life carries with it the lower in a transfigured > form. Gentagelsen tells of a young man who seeks to pass from the (esthetic > to the religious sphere, but for want of a true penitence becomes merely a > romanticist; i.e., he simply resumes his old self; and his case is > contrasted with that of Job, who humbled himself utterly before God, and at > last regained all that he had lost, and more‚Äîthe true ' repetition.\\"The > Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics Edited By James Hastings Charles > Scribner's Sons Edinburgh: T. & T.

Repetition p. 202 He is always asking himself questions just as Johann Gottlieb Fichte had done in his 1800 book, The Destination of Man, also called The Vocation of Man where he wrote against the easy answer for every question by vain repetitions. > The book is therefore not intended for philosophers by profession, who will > find in it nothing that may not be found in other writings of the same > author.

A Most pleasant Comedie of Mucedorus the Kings Sonne of Valentia, and Amadine the Kinges daughter of Aragon, commonly called Mucedorus, is an Elizabethan romantic comedy, first performed around 1590 and regularly revived until the Restoration. It was one of the most performed plays of its age,Hattaway (1982, 129). and 16 quarto editions were published between 1598 and 1668 making it the most widely printed play from the time. It was performed for both Queen Elizabeth and King James I. A revised and expanded version was published in 1610 with additional scenes. Mucedorus has been attributed to William Shakespeare in whole and in part, but these theories are generally not accepted by Shakespeare scholars. It is generally classified as apocryphal and not part of the main Shakespearean canon. Other proposed authors have included George Peele, Robert Greene, and Thomas Lodge. Greene's James IV (c. 1590) and Peele's Old Wive's Tale (1595) belong to the same genre.Hattaway (1982, 130).  Synopsis  A prologue was added to the play when it was performed for James I. The play opens with an induction that consists of a meta-theatrical flyting between the allegorical personifications Comedy and Envy. Envy declares that he will turn this pleasant comedy into a tragedy. Comedy challenges Envy to do so and claims that mirth will triumph in the end. The scenes usually labelled as act one, scenes one and two were new additions to the text with its Jacobean revision. In these scenes, the Prince of Valencia, Mucedorus, having heard that Amadine, the daughter of the king of Aragon, is extraordinarily beautiful, bids farewell to his friend Anselmo, revealing to him his plan to disguise himself in order to pursue her. Anselmo offers him the costume of a shepherd in which he has previously performed in a masque. Mucedorus disguises himself, swears Amselmo to secrecy, and departs. The second additional scene introduces the clown of the play, Mouse. He enters having fled from feeding his master's horse, frightened by a bear, or \\"some devil in a bear's doublet\\" (1.2.3). In his attempt to escape it, he advances backwards, only to trip over the bear and flee in terror. The original version of the play began with Segasto, who is bethrothed to Amadine, running in terror, swiftly followed by Amadine herself, from a bear that chases them across the stage. Segasto abandons Amadine, but she is rescued by Mucedorus, who appears wielding a sword and the bear's head. She thanks him and invites him to the court of Aragon. Upon Amadine and Mucedorus's arrival, Segasto becomes envious of Mucedorus, a lowly shepherd who is now honoured in court for his bravery. Segasto thus asks his friend, Tremelio, to kill Mucedorus, which Tremelio agrees to do, but Mucedorus dispatches him quickly. Mucedorus is brought before the King and sentenced to death for killing Tremelio, but Amadine reveals to the King that it was Mucedorus who saved her from the bear. The King spares Mucedorus's life, but Segasto falsifies a directive banishing Mucedorus from the kingdom. Amadine and Mucedorus declare their love for each other and decide to leave the kingdom together. While waiting to meet up with Mucedorus later in the nearby woods, Amadine is captured by Bremo, a wild man, to be his bride. Mucedorus, finding that Amadine has disappeared, disguises himself again as a hermit and is captured by Bremo as well. Mucedorus convinces Bremo that he and Amadine must be taught how to fight so that they may defend themselves when Bremo is not around to protect them. Once Bremo gives Mucedorus a sword, Mucedorus kills him and sheds his disguise as the hermit and becomes the shepherd again. Segasto, who had been searching the forest for the lost couple, finds Amadine and Mucedorus. Amadine declares her love for Mucedorus, and Segasto decides to relent. Mucedorus now reveals that he is actually the Prince of Valencia. Upon learning of these events, the King approves of the marriage between Mucedorus and Amadine, and the play ends with all the characters leaving to celebrate. The characters Envy and Comedy return to the stage, with Envy claiming that he can still defeat Comedy. As the two fight, they recognise the monarch in the audience (either Queen Elizabeth or King James) and declare that both comedy and tragedy serve the throne. Source and genre Modern scholarship suggests a date for the play's origin c. 1590. Individual critics have considered The Arcadia of Sir Philip Sidney (one of whose characters is named Musidorus) as a source for the play, and have studied its relationship to pastoral and folktale forms, and to traditional mummers' plays, Medieval theatre and chivalric romances, and the Italian Commedia dell'arte.Logan and Smith, pp. 229‚Äì30. Mucedorus is an early romantic comedy. It often elicits humour through rapid transitions between comedy and tragedy. For example, when Bremo is killed, there is only one line reflecting on his death before the play returns to the romantic plot. Most of the characters in Mucedorus are stock expectations for the genre, offering little depth or originality. Mouse's deafness is a play on the stock comedic fools who often wilfully twist a speaker's words. Printing history Mucedorus was the most frequently reprinted play prior to the Restoration, with 17 quarto texts surviving before the end of the 17th century. Staging history Mucedorus was performed by strolling players as late as the eighteenth century. One such performance, at Witney in Oxfordshire on 3 February 1653 (new style), saw a number of the audience killed and injured when the floor collapsed under the weight of the crowd. A Puritan preacher considered the accident a sign of God's displeasure with play-acting. Relationship to Shakespeare Q3 (1610) of Mucedorus claims that it was in the repertoire of the Globe Theatre: > A/Most pleasant/Comedie of Muce-/dorus the Kings sonne of Valen-/tia, and > Amadine the Kinges/daughter of Aragon./With the merry conceites of > Mouse./Amplified with new additions, as it was/acted before the Kings > Maistie at/White-hall on Shroue-/sunday night./By his Highnes Seruantes > vsually/playing at the Globe./Very delectable, and full of conceited > Mirth./Imprinted at London for William Iones./dwelling neare Holborne > Conduit/at the signe of the Gunne./1610./Henrietta C. Bartlett, Mr. William > Shakespeare, Original and Early Editions of His Quartos and Folios: His > Source Books and those containing Contemporary Notices (New Haven 1922), p. > 61. Starting with this same Q3 and continuing through all subsequent editions, the text of the play is augmented with six additional passages, which are plainly not the work of the original author. Some early critics considered Shakespeare as a potential author of these additions rather than the original play ‚Äì though even this view is not regarded with favour by the modern scholarly consensus.One exception among twentieth-century critics: MacDonald P. Jackson, who assigned the 1610 additions to Shakespeare. Logan and Smith, p. 228. The play was assigned to Shakespeare in Edward Archer's play list of 1656, published in his edition of The Old Law; it was also bound together with Fair Em and The Merry Devil of Edmonton in a book labelled \\"Shakespeare. Vol. I\\" in the library of King Charles II. Notes References * Chambers, E.K.

The Times and Democrat is owned by Lee Enterprises, a company based in Davenport, Iowa. It has a daily circulation of 13,395. History and origins The Times and Democrat traces its history to the October 1881 merger of The Orangeburg Democrat and The Orangeburg Times. It also has ties to four other newspapers born in the aftermath of the American Civil War: The Southron, The Tax-Payer, The Edisto Clarion and The Orangeburg News and Times. Like most newspapers of the South during Reconstruction, the Orangeburg publications were embroiled in political doctrines. The Orangeburg News, for instance, was organized as a newspaper of the Democrats but later made the bold move of becoming a newspaper of the Republicans. Into this milieu came James L. Sims. The Charleston, South Carolina, native learned the printing trade at The Charleston Courier and subsequently purchased an interest in The Spartanburg Herald. When his wife died, Sims sold his interest and moved to Orangeburg. In 1878, he purchased The Edisto Clarion, successor to The Tax-Payer, and changed its name again, to The Orangeburg Democrat. Sims' editor at the Democrat was Stiles R. Mellichamp, who after a short period left to start his own newspaper, The Orangeburg Times. In 1881, Sims and Mellichamp came together again to merge their newspapers into The Times and Democrat. A close Orangeburg newspaper colleague of Sims in those early days was Hugo S. Sheridan. Some years later, Sims married Sheridan's daughter. From this marriage came four sons, three of whom were involved in the paper. James Izlar Sims, the oldest, dropped out of school at age 14 to work at The Times and Democrat. The news content was a little different then. One of the biggest events of the year was the ginning of the first bale of cotton. Automobiles running into mules and cows usually received big coverage. Sports received little attention. Typesetting was done by hand, one letter at a time, until 1906, when The Times and Democrat purchased a new Ottmar Mergenthaler Linotype machine at a cost of $3,600. J. Izlar Sims, then 16 years old, was sent to New York City to learn how to operate the new machine that was destined to revolutionize the newspaper industry. Five years later, at the age of 21, he succeeded his father as publisher. J. Izlar Sims also founded a radio station and brought the first talking picture (movie theater) to Orangeburg, in the late 1920s. He was a volunteer firefighter and often drove the city's first fire truck. He died in 1957. J.L. Sims' twin boys, Hugo and Henry Sims, shared the editorship of the newspaper until Henry was elected to the South Carolina State Senate in the 1930s and later became president of Winthrop College. Hugo Sims continued as editor until his death in 1951. The youngest son, Gelzer Sims, graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy and achieved the rank of admiral during World War II. Mellichamp and Sheridan became full-time educators. Today, Orangeburg elementary schools bear each of their names. A weekly publication since its founding, The Times and Democrat began publishing twice a week in 1908, three times a week in 1909 and five times a week in September 1919. It returned to tri-weekly publication in May 1921 but later resumed daily publication. A Monday edition was added in the 1940s and the Sunday edition in 1953. J.L. Sims succeeded his father as publisher in 1943. In 1951 Hugo Sims Sr. died and his son, Edward, succeeded him as editor. In the 1960s, Hugo Sims' other two sons, Hugo Jr. and Henry, served as co-editors. After J.L. Sims died in 1962 at age 47, surviving family members named Dean Livingston, 29, as publisher, a position he held until his retirement in 1999. A century ago, The Times and Democrat was the first newspaper in town to buy a cylinder press. In 1965 The Times and Democrat became South Carolina's first daily newspaper to convert to offset printing. In 1989 The Times and Democrat became South Carolina's first daily newspaper to design its pages entirely with computers. The Times and Democrat has continued to publish daily despite hurricanes, snowstorms and a 1972 fire that destroyed The Times and Democrat's entire physical plant. Within five days of that fire, new typesetting machines and other production equipment were flown in. Within 10 days, a new press had arrived, and within 30 days, the pressroom building had been rebuilt around it. Howard Publications acquired total ownership of The Times and Democrat in 1981. Lee Enterprises acquired Howard Publications and subsequently The Times and Democrat in 2002. Cathy Hughes became The Times and Democrat's fifth publisher in 1999. The current editor is Lee Harter. Like many of today's newspapers, The Times and Democrat now publishes a website to complement its print edition. Further reading T&D; Staff Report. The T&D; is Born.

It is part of the wolf-like canids, and is the most widely abundant terrestrial carnivore. The dog and the extant gray wolf are sister taxa as modern wolves are not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated, which implies that the direct ancestor of the dog is extinct. The dog was the first species to be domesticated, and has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes. Their long association with humans has led dogs to be uniquely attuned to human behavior, and they can thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids. Dogs vary widely in shape, size, and colors.Why are different breeds of dogs all considered the same species? ‚Äì Scientific American . Nikhil Swaminathan. Accessed on 28 August 2016. They perform many roles for humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and military, companionship, and, more recently, aiding disabled people, and therapeutic roles. This influence on human society has given them the sobriquet of \\"man's best friend.\\" Taxonomy In 1758, the Swedish botanist and zoologist Carl Linnaeus published in his Systema Naturae the binomial nomenclature ‚Äì or the two-word naming ‚Äì of species. Canis is the Latin word meaning \\"dog\\", and under this genus, he listed the dog-like carnivores, including domestic dogs, wolves, and jackals. He classified the domestic dog as Canis familiaris, and on the next page, he classified the wolf as Canis lupus. Linnaeus considered the dog to be a separate species from the wolf because of its cauda recurvata - its upturning tail, which is not found in any other canid. In 1999, a study of mitochondrial DNA indicated that the domestic dog might have originated from multiple grey wolf populations, with the dingo and New Guinea singing dog \\"breeds\\" having developed at a time when human communities were more isolated from each other. In the third edition of Mammal Species of the World published in 2005, the mammalogist W. Christopher Wozencraft listed under the wolf Canis lupus its wild subspecies, and proposed two additional subspecies: \\"familiaris Linneaus, 1758 [domestic dog]\\" and \\"dingo Meyer, 1793 [domestic dog]\\". Wozencraft included hallstromi ‚Äì the New Guinea singing dog ‚Äì as a taxonomic synonym for the dingo. Wozencraft referred to the mDNA study as one of the guides informing his decision. Other mammalogists have noted the inclusion of familiaris and dingo under a \\"domestic dog\\" clade. This classification by Wozencraft is debated among zoologists. In 2019, a workshop hosted by the IUCN/Species Survival Commission's Canid Specialist Group considered the New Guinea singing dog and the dingo to be feral dogs Canis familiaris, and therefore should not be assessed for the IUCN Red List. Origin The domestic dog's origin includes the dog's genetic divergence from the wolf, its domestication, and its development into dog types and dog breeds. The dog is a member of the genus Canis, which forms part of the wolf-like canids, and was the first species and the only large carnivore to have been domesticated. Genetic studies comparing dogs with modern wolves show reciprocal monophyly (separate groups), which implies that dogs are not genetically close to any living wolf and that their wild ancestor is extinct. An extinct Late Pleistocene wolf may have been the dog's ancestor, with the dog's similarity to the extant grey wolf being the result of genetic admixture between the two. In 2020, a literature review of canid domestication stated that modern dogs were not descended from the same Canis lineage as modern wolves, and proposes that dogs may be descended from a Pleistocene wolf closer in size to a village dog. The genetic divergence between dogs and wolves occurred between 20,000 and 40,000 years ago, just before or during the Last Glacial Maximum (20,000-27,000 years ago). This period represents the upper time-limit for domestication commencement because it is the time of divergence and not the time of domestication, which occurred later. One of the most critical transitions in human history was the domestication of animals, which began with the long-term association between wolves and hunter‚Äìgatherers more than 15,000 years ago. The archaeological record and genetic analysis show the remains of the Bonn‚ÄìOberkassel dog buried beside humans 14,200 years ago to be the first undisputed dog, with disputed remains occurring 36,000 years ago. Biology Lateral view of skeleton Anatomy Skull of a dog Domestic dogs have been selectively bred for millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes. Modern dog breeds show more variation in size, appearance, and behavior than any other domestic animal. Dogs are predators and scavengers; like many other predatory mammals, the dog has powerful muscles, large and sharp claws and teeth, fused wrist bones, a cardiovascular system that supports both sprinting and endurance, and teeth for catching and tearing. =Size and weight= Dogs are highly variable in height and weight. The smallest known adult dog was a Yorkshire Terrier, that stood only at the shoulder, in length along the head-and-body, and weighed only . The most massive known dog was a Saint Bernard, which weighed and was from the snout to the tail. The tallest dog is a Great Dane that stands at the shoulder. =Senses= The dog's senses include vision, hearing, smell, taste, touch and sensitivity to the earth's magnetic field. Another study suggested that dogs can see the earth's magnetic field.Magnetoreception molecule found in the eyes of dogs and primates MPI Brain Research, 22 February 2016 =Coat= Dogs display a wide variation on coat type, density, length, color, and composition The coats of domestic dogs are of two varieties: \\"double\\" being familiar with dogs (as well as wolves) originating from colder climates, made up of a coarse guard hair and a soft down hair, or \\"single,\\" with the topcoat only. Breeds may have an occasional \\"blaze,\\" stripe, or \\"star\\" of white fur on their chest or underside. The coat can be maintained or affected by multiple nutrients present in the diet; see Coat (dog) for more information. Premature graying can occur in dogs from as early as one year of age; this is shown to be associated with impulsive behaviors, anxiety behaviors, fear of noise, and fear of unfamiliar people or animals. =Tail= Finnish Spitz with curled tail There are many different shapes for dog tails: straight, straight up, sickle, curled, or cork-screw. As with many canids, one of the primary functions of a dog's tail is to communicate their emotional state, which can be crucial in getting along with others. In some hunting dogs, however, the tail is traditionally docked to avoid injuries. In some breeds, such as the Braque du Bourbonnais, puppies can be born with a short tail or no tail at all. =Differences from wolves= Despite their close genetic relationship and inter-breed ability, there are several diagnostic features to distinguish the gray wolves from domestic dogs. Domesticated dogs are distinguishable from wolves by starch gel electrophoresis of red blood cell acid phosphatase.Elliot, D.G., and M. Wong. 1972. Acid phosphatase, handy enzyme that separates the dog from the wolf. Acta Biologica et Medica Germanica 28:957‚Äì962 The tympanic bullae are large, convex, and almost spherical in gray wolves, while the bullae of dogs are smaller, compressed, and slightly crumpled. Compared with equally sized wolves, dogs tend to have 20% smaller skulls and 30% smaller brains. The teeth of gray wolves are also proportionately larger than those of dogs.Clutton-Brock, Juliet (1987). A Natural History of Domesticated Mammals. British Museum (Natural History), p. 24, Dogs have a more domed forehead and a distinctive \\"stop\\" between the forehead and nose. The temporalis muscle that closes the jaws is more robust in wolves. Wolves do not have dewclaws on their back legs unless there has been admixture with dogs that had them. Most dogs lack a functioning pre- caudal gland and enter estrus twice yearly, unlike gray wolves, which only do so once a year. So-called primitive dogs such as dingoes and Basenjis retain the yearly estrus cycle. Dogs generally have brown eyes, and wolves almost always have amber or light-colored eyes. Domestic dogs' skin tends to be thicker than that of wolves, with some Inuit tribes favoring the former for use as clothing due to its greater resistance to wear and tear in harsh weather. The paws of a dog are half the size of a wolf, and their tails tend to curl upwards, another trait not found in wolves. The dog has developed into hundreds of varied breeds and shows more behavioral and morphological variation than any other land mammal. Health Many household plants are poisonous to dogs (and other mammals), including Begonia, Poinsettia, and Aloe vera. Some breeds of dogs are prone to specific genetic ailments such as elbow and hip dysplasia, blindness, deafness, pulmonic stenosis, cleft palate, and trick knees. Two severe medical conditions significantly affecting dogs are pyometra, affecting unspayed females of all types and ages, and gastric dilatation volvulus (bloat), which affects the larger breeds or deep-chested dogs. Both of these are acute conditions and can kill rapidly. Dogs are also susceptible to parasites such as fleas, ticks, mites, hookworms, tapeworms, roundworms, and heartworms (roundworm species that lives in the heart of dogs). Several human foods and household ingestibles are toxic to dogs, including chocolate solids (theobromine poisoning), onion and garlic (thiosulphate, sulfoxide or disulfide poisoning),Sources vary on which of these are considered the most significant toxic item. grapes and raisins, macadamia nuts, xylitol, as well as various plants and other potentially ingested materials. The nicotine in tobacco can also be dangerous. Dogs can be exposed to the substance by scavenging through garbage bins or ashtrays and eating cigars and cigarettes. Signs can be vomiting of large amounts (e.g., from eating cigar butts) or diarrhea. Some other symptoms are abdominal pain, loss of coordination, collapse, or death. Dogs are susceptible to theobromine poisoning, typically from the ingestion of chocolate. Theobromine is toxic to dogs because, although the dog's metabolism is capable of breaking down the chemical, the process is so slow that for some dogs, even small amounts of chocolate can be fatal, mostly dark chocolate. Dogs are also vulnerable to some of the same health conditions as humans, including diabetes, dental and heart disease, epilepsy, cancer, hypothyroidism, and arthritis. =Lifespan= Mixed-breed dogs such as this terrier have been found to run faster and live longer than their pure-bred parents (see Heterosis). In 2013, a study found that mixed breed dogs live on average 1.2 years longer than purebred dogs. Increasing body-weight was negatively correlated with longevity (i.e., the heavier the dog, the shorter its lifespan). The typical lifespan of dogs varies widely among breeds, but for most, the median longevity, the age at which half the dogs in a population have died, and half are still alive, ranges from 10 to 13 years. Individual dogs may live well beyond the median of their breed. The breed with the shortest lifespan (among breeds for which there is a questionnaire survey with reasonable sample size) is the Dogue de Bordeaux, with a median longevity of about 5.2 years. Still, several breeds, including miniature bull terriers, bloodhounds, and Irish wolfhounds are nearly as short-lived, with median longevities of 6 to 7 years. The longest- lived breeds, including toy poodles, Japanese spitz, Border terriers, and Tibetan spaniels, have median longevities of 14 to 15 years. The median longevity of mixed-breed dogs, taken as an average of all sizes, is one or more years longer than that of purebred dogs when all breeds are averaged. The longest-lived dog was \\"Bluey,\\" an Australian Cattle Dog who died in 1939 at 29.5 years of age.Edition included both Bluey and Taffy. Reproduction Female dog nursing newborn puppies In domestic dogs, sexual maturity happens around six to twelve months of age for both males and females, although this can be delayed until up to two years old for some large breeds, and is the time at which female dogs will have their first estrous cycle. They will experience subsequent estrous cycles semiannually, during which the body prepares for pregnancy. At the peak of the cycle, females will become estrus, mentally, and physically receptive to copulation. Because the ova survive and can be fertilized for a week after ovulation, more than one male can sire the same litter. Fertilization typically occurs 2‚Äì5 days after ovulation; 14‚Äì16 days after ovulation, the embryo attaches to the uterus, and after 7-8 more days, the heartbeat is detectable. Dogs bear their litters roughly 58 to 68 days after fertilization, with an average of 63 days, although the length of gestation can vary. An average litter consists of about six puppies, though this number may vary widely based on dog breed. In general, toy dogs produce from one to four puppies in each litter, while much larger breeds may average as many as twelve. Some dog breeds have acquired traits through selective breeding that interfere with reproduction. Male French Bulldogs, for instance, are incapable of mounting the female. For many dogs of this breed, the female must be artificially inseminated to reproduce. =Neutering= A feral dog from Sri Lanka nursing very well-developed puppies Neutering refers to the sterilization of animals, usually by removing the male's testicles or the female's ovaries and uterus, to eliminate the ability to procreate and reduce sex drive. Because of dogs' overpopulation in some countries, many animal control agencies, such as the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA), advise that dogs not intended for further breeding should be neutered. That way, they do not have undesired puppies that may later be euthanized. According to the Humane Society of the United States, 3‚Äì4 million dogs and cats are euthanized each year. Many more are confined to cages in shelters because there are many more animals than there are homes. Spaying or castrating dogs helps keep overpopulation down. Local humane societies, SPCAs, and other animal protection organizations urge people to neuter their pets and adopt animals from shelters instead of purchasing them. Neutering reduces problems caused by hypersexuality, especially in male dogs. Spayed female dogs are less likely to develop cancer, affecting mammary glands, ovaries, and other reproductive organs. However, neutering increases the risk of urinary incontinence in female dogs, and prostate cancer in males, and osteosarcoma, hemangiosarcoma, cruciate ligament rupture, obesity, and diabetes mellitus in either sex. Inbreeding depression A common breeding practice for pet dogs is mating between close relatives (e.g., between half- and full siblings). Inbreeding depression is considered to be due mainly to the expression of homozygous deleterious recessive mutations. Outcrossing between unrelated individuals, including dogs of different breeds, results in the beneficial masking of deleterious recessive mutations in progeny. In a study of seven breeds of dogs (Bernese mountain dog, basset hound, Cairn terrier, Epagneul Breton, German Shepherd dog, Leonberger, and West Highland white terrier), it was found that inbreeding decreases litter size and survival. Another analysis of data on 42,855 dachshund litters found that as the inbreeding coefficient increased, litter size decreased, and the percentage of stillborn puppies increased, thus indicating inbreeding depression. In a study of boxer litters, 22% of puppies died before reaching seven weeks of age. Stillbirth was the most frequent cause of death, followed by infection. Mortality due to infection increased significantly with increases in inbreeding. Intelligence, behavior, and communication Intelligence Dog intelligence is the dog's ability to perceive information and retain it as knowledge for applying to solve problems. Studies of two dogs suggest that dogs can learn by inference and have advanced memory skills. A study with Rico, a border collie, showed that he knew the labels of over 200 different items. He inferred the names of novel things by exclusion learning and correctly retrieved those new items immediately and four weeks after the initial exposure. A study of another border collie, \\"Chaser,\\" documented his learning and memory capabilities. He had learned the names and could associate by verbal command over 1,000 words. Dogs can read and react appropriately to human body language such as gesturing and pointing and human voice commands. A 2018 study on canine cognitive abilities found that dogs' capabilities are no more exceptional than those of other animals, such as horses, chimpanzees, or cats. Various animals, including pigs, pigeons, and chimpanzees, can remember the \\"what, where, and when\\" of an event, which dogs cannot do. Dogs demonstrate a theory of mind by engaging in deception. An experimental study showed compelling evidence that Australian dingos can outperform domestic dogs in non-social problem-solving, indicating that domestic dogs may have lost much of their original problem-solving abilities once they joined humans. Another study revealed that after undergoing training to solve a simple manipulation task, dogs faced with an insoluble version of the same problem look at the human, while socialized wolves do not. Behavior A 3-year-old Border Collie at showing companion for human Dog behavior is the internally coordinated responses (actions or inactions) of the domestic dog (individuals or groups) to internal and external stimuli. As the oldest domesticated species, with estimates ranging from 9,000‚Äì30,000 years BCE, dogs' minds inevitably have been shaped by millennia of contact with humans. As a result of this physical and social evolution, dogs have acquired the ability to understand and communicate with humans more than any other species, and they are uniquely attuned to human behaviors. Behavioral scientists have uncovered a surprising set of social-cognitive abilities in the domestic dog. These abilities are not possessed by the dog's closest canine relatives or other highly intelligent mammals such as great apes but rather parallel to children's social-cognitive skills. Unlike other domestic species selected for production-related traits, dogs were initially selected for their behaviors.Serpell J, Duffy D. Dog Breeds and Their Behavior. In: Domestic Dog Cognition and Behavior. Berlin, Heidelberg: Springer; 2014 In 2016, a study found that only 11 fixed genes showed variation between wolves and dogs. These gene variations were unlikely to have been the result of natural evolution and indicate selection on both morphology and behavior during dog domestication. These genes have been shown to affect the catecholamine synthesis pathway, with the majority of the genes affecting the fight-or-flight responseAlmada RC, Coimbra NC. Recruitment of striatonigral disinhibitory and nigrotectal inhibitory GABAergic pathways during the organization of defensive behavior by mice in a dangerous environment with the venomous snake Bothrops alternatus [ Reptilia, Viperidae ] Synapse 2015:n/a‚Äìn/a (i.e., selection for tameness), and emotional processing. Dogs generally show reduced fear and aggression compared with wolves.Coppinger R, Schneider R: Evolution of working dogs. The domestic dog: Its evolution, behaviour and interactions with people. Cambridge: Cambridge University press, 1995. Some of these genes have been associated with aggression in some dog breeds, indicating their importance in both the initial domestication and later in breed formation. Traits of high sociability and lack of fear in dogs may include genetic modifications related to Williams-Beuren syndrome in humans, which cause hyper sociability at the expense of problem-solving ability. Communication Dog communication is how dogs convey information to other dogs, understand messages from humans, and translate the information that dogs are transmitting.Coren, Stanley \\"How To Speak Dog: Mastering the Art of Dog-Human Communication\\" 2000 Simon & Schuster, New York. Communication behaviors of dogs include eye gaze, facial expression, vocalization, body posture (including movements of bodies and limbs), and gustatory communication (scents, pheromones, and taste). Humans communicate to dogs by using vocalization, hand signals, and body posture. Ecology Population In 2013, an estimated global dog population was between 700 million and 987 million. Although it is said that the \\"dog is man's best friend,\\" this refers mainly to the ~20% of dogs that live in developed countries. In the developing world, dogs are more commonly feral or communally owned, with pet dogs uncommon. Most of these dogs live their lives as scavengers and have never been owned by humans, with one study showing their most common response when approached by strangers is to run away (52%) or respond aggressively (11%). Little is known about these dogs, or the dogs in developed countries that are feral, stray, or are in shelters because the great majority of modern research on dog cognition has focused on pet dogs living in human homes. Competitors and predators Although dogs are the most abundant and widely distributed terrestrial carnivores, feral, and free- ranging dogs' potential to compete with other large carnivores is limited by their strong association with humans. For example, a review of the studies in dogs' competitive effects on sympatric carnivores did not mention any research on competition between dogs and wolves. Although wolves are known to kill dogs, they tend to live in pairs or in small packs in areas where they are highly persecuted, giving them a disadvantage facing large dog groups. Wolves kill dogs wherever they are found together. One study reported that in Wisconsin, in 1999, more compensation had been paid for losses due to wolves taking dogs than for wolves taking livestock. In Wisconsin, wolves will often kill hunting dogs, possibly because they are in the wolf's territory. A strategy has been reported in Russia where one wolf lures a dog into a heavy brush where another wolf waits in ambush. In some instances, wolves have displayed an uncharacteristic fearlessness of humans and buildings when attacking dogs, to the extent that they have to be beaten off or killed. Although the numbers of dogs killed each year are relatively low, it induces a fear of wolves entering villages and farmyards to take dogs, and losses of dogs to wolves have led to demands for more liberal wolf hunting regulations. Coyotes and big cats have also been known to attack dogs. In particular, leopards are known to have a preference for dogs and have been recorded to kill and consume them no matter their size. Tigers in Manchuria, Indochina, Indonesia, and Malaysia are also reported to kill dogs. Striped hyenas are known to kill dogs in Turkmenistan, India, and the Caucasus. Dogs are usually prey for the American alligator. Diet Golden Retriever gnawing on a pig's foot Dogs have been described as carnivores or omnivores. Compared to wolves, dogs from agricultural societies have extra copies of amylase and other genes involved in starch digestion that contribute to an increased ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet. Also, like humans, some dog breeds produce amylase in their saliva. Based on metabolism and nutrition, many consider the dog to be an omnivore. However, the dog is not merely an omnivore. More like the cat and less like other omnivores, the dog can only produce bile acid with taurine, and it cannot produce vitamin D, which it obtains from animal flesh. Also, more like the cat, the dog requires arginine to maintain its nitrogen balance. These nutritional requirements place the dog part-way between carnivores and omnivores. Range As a domesticated or semi-domesticated animal, the dog is nearly universal among human societies. Notable exceptions once included: * Aboriginal Tasmanians, who were separated from Australia before the arrival of dingos on that continent * The Andamanese, who were isolated when rising sea levels covered the land bridge to Myanmar * The Fuegians, who instead domesticated the Fuegian dog, a different canid species * Individual Pacific islands whose maritime settlers did not bring dogs, or where dogs died out after original settlement, notably: the Mariana Islands, Palau, Marshall Islands, Gilbert Islands, New Caledonia, Vanuatu, Tonga, Marquesas, Mangaia in the Cook Islands, Rapa Iti in French Polynesia, Easter Island, Chatham Islands, and Pitcairn Island (settled by the Bounty mutineers, who killed off their dogs to escape discovery by passing ships). Dogs were introduced to Antarctica as sled dogs but were later outlawed by international agreement due to the possible risk of spreading infections.\\"Did you know that dogs are banned from Antarctica?\\", South Pole 1911-2011 Breeds phenotypic variation The domestic dog is the first species, and the only large carnivore, known to have been domesticated. Especially over the past 200 years, dogs have undergone rapid phenotypic change and were formed into today's modern dog breeds due to artificial selection by humans. These breeds can vary in size and weight from a teacup poodle to a giant mastiff. Phenotypic variation can include height measured to the withers ranging from in the Chihuahua to in the Irish Wolfhound. Color varies from white through grays (usually called \\"blue\\") to black, and browns from light (tan) to dark (\\"red\\" or \\"chocolate\\") in a wide variety of patterns; coats can be short or long, coarse-haired to wool-like, straight, curly, or smooth. The skull, body, and limb proportions vary significantly between breeds, with dogs displaying more phenotypic diversity than can be found within carnivores' entire order. Some breeds demonstrate outstanding skills in herding, retrieving, scent detection, and guarding, demonstrating the functional and behavioral diversity of dogs. The first dogs were domesticated from shared ancestors of modern wolves; however, the phenotypic changes that coincided with the dog-wolf genetic divergence are unknown. Roles with humans Gunnar Kaasen and Balto, the lead dog on the last relay team of the 1925 serum run to Nome Domestic dogs inherited complex behaviors, such as bite inhibition, from their wolf ancestors, which would have been pack hunters with complex body language. These sophisticated forms of social cognition and communication may account for their trainability, playfulness, and ability to fit into human households and social situations. These attributes have given dogs a relationship with humans that has enabled them to become one of the most successful species today. The dogs' value to early human hunter-gatherers led to them quickly becoming ubiquitous across world cultures. Dogs perform many roles for people, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and military, companionship, and, more recently, aiding disabled individuals. This influence on human society has given them the nickname \\"man's best friend\\" in the Western world. In some cultures, however, dogs are also a source of meat. Early roles Wolves, and their dog descendants, likely derived significant benefits from living in human camps ‚Äì more safety, more reliable food, lesser caloric needs, and more chance to breed. They would have benefited from humans' upright gait that gives them a more extensive range over which to see potential predators and prey, and better color vision that, at least by day, gives humans better visual discrimination. Camp dogs would also have benefited from human tool use, bringing down larger prey and controlling fire for various purposes. Humans would also have derived enormous benefit from the dogs associated with their camps. For instance, dogs would have improved sanitation by cleaning up food scraps. Dogs may have provided warmth, as referred to in the Australian Aboriginal expression \\"three dog night\\" (a frigidly cold night). They would have alerted the camp to predators or strangers, using their acute hearing to provide an early warning. It has been suggested that the most significant benefit would have been the use of dogs' robust sense of smell to assist with the hunt. The relationship between a dog's presence and success in the hunt is often mentioned as a primary reason for the domestication of the wolf, and a 2004 study of hunter groups with and without a dog gives quantitative support to the hypothesis that the benefits of cooperative hunting were an essential factor in wolf domestication. The cohabitation of dogs and humans likely improved the chances of survival for early human groups. The domestication of dogs may have been one of the key forces that led to human success. Human emigrants from Siberia that came across the Bering land bridge into North America likely had dogs in their company. Although one writerA History of Dogs in the Early Americas, Marion Schwartz, 1998, 260 p., , Yale University Press even suggests that sled dogs' use may have been critical to the success of the waves that entered North America roughly 12,000 years ago, the earliest archaeological evidence of dog-like canids in North America dates from about 9,400 years ago. Dogs were an important part of life for the Athabascan population in North America and were their only domesticated animal. Dogs as pack animals may have contributed to the Apache and Navajo tribes' migration 1,400 years ago. This use of dogs in these cultures often persisted after the introduction of the horse to North America. p. 12 As pets Green velvet dog collar, dating from 1670 to 1690 Siberian Huskies are pack animals that still enjoy some human companionship British Bulldog relaxes at a park It is estimated that three-quarters of the world's dog population lives in the developing world as feral, village, or community dogs, with pet dogs uncommon. \\"The most widespread form of interspecies bonding occurs between humans and dogs\\" and the keeping of dogs as companions, particularly by elites, has a long history (see the Bonn‚ÄìOberkassel dog). Pet-dog populations grew significantly after World War II as suburbanization increased. In the 1950s and 1960s, dogs were kept outside more often than they tend to be today (the expression \\"in the doghouse\\" - recorded since 1932 \\\\- to describe exclusion from the group implies a distance between the doghouse and the home) and were still primarily functional, acting as a guard, children's playmate, or walking companion. From the 1980s, there have been changes in the pet dog's role, such as the increased role of dogs in the emotional support of their human guardians. People and their dogs have become increasingly integrated and implicated in each other's lives, to the point where pet dogs actively shape how a family and home are experienced. There have been two significant trends occurring within the second half of the 20th century in pet dogs' changing status. The first has been the \\"commodification,\\" shaping it to conform to social expectations of personality and behavior. The second has been the broadening of the family's concept and the home to include dogs-as-dogs within everyday routines and practices. A vast range of commodity forms aims to transform a pet dog into an ideal companion. The list of goods, services, and places available is enormous: from dog perfumes, couture, furniture, and housing, to dog groomers, therapists, trainers and caretakers, dog cafes, spas, parks and beaches, and dog hotels, airlines, and cemeteries. While dog training as an organized activity has operated since the 18th century, it became a high-profile issue in the last decades of the 20th century. Many normal dog behaviors such as barking, jumping up, digging, rolling in dung, fighting, and urine marking (which dogs do to establish territory through scent) became increasingly incompatible with a pet dog's new role. Dog training books, classes, and television programs proliferated as the process of commodifying the pet dog continued. The majority of contemporary dog owners describe their pet as part of the family, although some ambivalence about the relationship is evident in the popular reconceptualization of the dog-human family as a pack. Some dog-trainers, such as on the television program Dog Whisperer, have promoted a dominance-model of dog-human relationships. However, it has been disputed that \\"trying to achieve status\\" is characteristic of dog-human interactions. Pet dogs play an active role in family life; for example, a study of conversations in dog-human families showed how family members use the dog as a resource, talking to the dog, or talking through the dog; to mediate their interactions with each other. Increasingly, human family-members engage in activities centered on the dog's perceived needs and interests, or in which the dog is an integral partner, such as dog dancing and dog yoga. According to statistics published by the American Pet Products Manufacturers Association in the National Pet Owner Survey in 2009‚Äì2010, an estimated 77.5 million people in the United States have pet dogs. The same source shows that nearly 40% of American households own at least one dog, of which 67% own just one dog, 25% two dogs and nearly 9% more than two dogs. There does not seem to be any gender preference among dogs as pets, as the statistical data reveal an equal number of female and male dog pets. Although several programs promote pet adoption, less than a fifth of the owned dogs come from shelters. Some research suggests that a pet dog produces a considerable carbon footprint. A study using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to compare humans and dogs showed that dogs have the same response to voices and use the same parts of the brain as humans do. This gives dogs the ability to recognize human emotional sounds, making them friendly social pets to humans. Work Dogs have lived and worked with humans in many roles. In addition to dogs' role as companion animals, dogs have been bred for herding livestock (collies, sheepdogs),Dewey, T. and S. Bhagat. 2002. \\"Canis lupus familiaris, Animal Diversity Web. hunting (hounds, pointers), and rodent control (terriers). Other types of working dogs include search and rescue dogs,Vikki Fenton, The use of dogs in search, rescue and recovery, Journal of Wilderness Medicine, Vol. 3, Issue 3, August 1992, pp. 292‚Äì300. detection dogs trained to detect illicit drugsJohn J. Ensminger, Police and Military Dogs: Criminal Detection, Forensic Evidence, and Judicial Admissibility (CRC Press, 2012). or chemical weapons;Philip Shernomay, Dogs Take Their Place in Arsenal Against Chemical Attack, New York Times (13 May 2003). guard dogs; dogs who assist fishermen with the use of nets; and dogs that pull loads. In 1957, the dog Laika became the first animal to be launched into Earth orbit, aboard the Soviets' Sputnik 2; she died during the flight. Various kinds of service dogs and assistance dogs, including guide dogs, hearing dogs, mobility assistance dogs, and psychiatric service dogs, assist individuals with disabilities. Some dogs owned by people with epilepsy have been shown to alert their handler when the handler shows signs of an impending seizure, sometimes well in advance of onset, allowing the guardian to seek safety, medication, or medical care. Sports and shows People often enter their dogs in competitions, such as breed-conformation shows or sports, including racing, sledding, and agility competitions. In conformation shows, also referred to as breed shows, a judge familiar with the specific dog breed evaluates individual purebred dogs for conformity with their established breed type as described in the breed standard. As the breed standard only deals with the dog's externally observable qualities (such as appearance, movement, and temperament), separately tested qualities (such as ability or health) are not part of the judging in conformation shows. As food Dog meat is consumed in some East Asian countries, including Korea, China, and Vietnam, which dates back to antiquity. It is estimated that 13‚Äì16 million dogs are killed and consumed in Asia every year. In China, debates have ensued over banning the consumption of dog meat. Following the Sui and Tang dynasties of the first millennium, however, people living on northern China's plains began to eschew eating dogs, which is likely due to Buddhism and Islam's spread, two religions that forbade the consumption of certain animals, including dog. As members of the upper classes shunned dog meat, it gradually became a social taboo to eat it, even though the general population continued to consume it for centuries afterward. Other cultures, such as Polynesia and pre-Columbian Mexico, also consumed dog meat in their history. However, Western, South Asian, African, and Middle Eastern cultures, in general, regard dog meat consumption as taboo. In some places, however, such as in rural areas of Poland, dog fat is believed to have medicinal properties ‚Äì being good for the lungs, for instance. Dog meat is also consumed in some parts of Switzerland. Proponents of eating dog meat have argued that placing a distinction between livestock and dogs is western hypocrisy and that there is no difference in eating different animals' meat. In Korea, the primary dog breed raised for meat, the nureongi (ÎàÑÎ†ÅÏù¥), differs from those breeds raised for pets that Koreans may keep in their homes.Pettid, Michael J., Korean Cuisine: An Illustrated History, London: Reaktion Books Ltd., 2008, 25. The most popular Korean dog dish is gaejang- guk (also called bosintang), a spicy stew meant to balance the body's heat during the summer months. Followers of the custom claim this is done to ensure good health by balancing one's gi or the body's vital energy. A 19th-century version of gaejang-guk explains that the dish is prepared by boiling dog meat with scallions and chili powder. Variations of the dish contain chicken and bamboo shoots. While the dishes are still prevalent in Korea with a segment of the population, dog is not as widely consumed as beef, chicken, and pork. Health risks to humans In 2005, the WHO reported that 55,000 people died in Asia and Africa from rabies, a disease for which dogs are the most important vector. Citing a 2008 study, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control estimated in 2015 that 4.5 million people in the USA are bitten by dogs each year. citing A 2015 study estimated that 1.8% of the U.S. population is bitten each year. In the 1980s and 1990s, the U.S. averaged 17 fatalities per year, while since 2007, this has increased to an average of 31. 77% of dog bites are from the pet of family or friends, and 50% of attacks occur on the dog's legal owner's property. A Colorado study found bites in children were less severe than bites in adults. The incidence of dog bites in the U.S. is 12.9 per 10,000 inhabitants, but for boys aged 5 to 9, the incidence rate is 60.7 per 10,000. Moreover, children have a much higher chance of being bitten in the face or neck. Sharp claws with powerful muscles behind them can lacerate flesh in a scratch that can lead to serious infections. In the U.K., between 2003 and 2004, there were 5,868 dog attacks on humans, resulting in 5,770 working days lost in sick leave. In the United States, cats and dogs are a factor in more than 86,000 falls each year. It has been estimated that around 2% of dog-related injuries treated in U.K. hospitals are domestic accidents. The same study found that while dog involvement in road traffic accidents was difficult to quantify, dog-associated road accidents involving injury more commonly involved two-wheeled vehicles. Toxocara canis (dog roundworm) eggs in dog feces can cause toxocariasis. In the United States, about 10,000 cases of Toxocara infection are reported in humans each year, and almost 14% of the U.S. population is infected. In Great Britain, 24% of soil samples taken from public parks contained T. canis eggs. Untreated toxocariasis can cause retinal damage and decreased vision. Dog feces can also contain hookworms that cause cutaneous larva migrans in humans. Health benefits for humans Doberman puppy being cuddled 338x338px Dogs suffer from the same common disorders as humans; these include cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and neurologic disorders. The pathology is similar to humans, as is their response to treatment and their outcomes. Researchers are now identifying the genes associated with dog diseases similar to human disorders but lack mouse models to find cures for dogs and humans. The genes involved in canine obsessive-compulsive disorders led to the detection of four genes in humans' related pathways. The scientific evidence is mixed as to whether a dog's companionship can enhance human physical health and psychological well- being. Studies suggesting that there are benefits to physical health and psychological well-being have been criticized for being poorly controlled. It found that \\"the health of elderly people is related to their health habits and social supports but not to their ownership of, or attachment to, a companion animal.\\" Earlier studies have shown that people who keep pet dogs or cats exhibit better mental and physical health than those who do not, making fewer visits to the doctor and being less likely to be on medication than non- guardians. A 2005 paper states, \\"recent research has failed to support earlier findings that pet ownership is associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, a reduced use of general practitioner services, or any psychological or physical benefits on health for community dwelling older people. Research has, however, pointed to significantly less absenteeism from school through sickness among children who live with pets.\\" In one study, new guardians reported a highly significant reduction in minor health problems during the first month following pet acquisition. This effect was sustained in those with dogs through to the end of the study. People with pet dogs took considerably more physical exercise than those with cats and those without pets. The results provide evidence that keeping pets may have positive effects on human health and behavior and that for guardians of dogs, these effects are relatively long-term. Pet guardianship has also been associated with increased coronary artery disease survival. Human guardians are significantly less likely to die within one year of an acute myocardial infarction than those who did not own dogs. The health benefits of dogs can result from contact with dogs in general, not solely from having dogs as pets. For example, when in a pet dog's presence, people show reductions in cardiovascular, behavioral, and psychological indicators of anxiety. Other health benefits are gained from exposure to immune-stimulating microorganisms, which can protect against allergies and autoimmune diseases according to the hygiene hypothesis. The benefits of contact with a dog also include social support, as dogs cannot only provide companionship and social support themselves but also act as facilitators of social interactions between humans. One study indicated that wheelchair users experience more positive social interactions with strangers when accompanied by a dog than when they are not. In 2015, a study found that pet owners were significantly more likely to get to know people in their neighborhood than non-pet owners. Using dogs and other animals as a part of therapy dates back to the late 18th century when animals were introduced into mental institutions to help socialize patients with mental disorders.Kruger, K.A. & Serpell, J.A. (2006). Animal-assisted interventions in mental health: Definitions and theoretical foundations, In Fine, A.H. (Ed.), Handbook on animal-assisted therapy: Theoretical foundations and guidelines for practice. San Diego, CA, Academic Press: 21‚Äì38. Animal-assisted intervention research has shown that animal-assisted therapy with a dog can increase social behaviors, such as smiling and laughing, among people with Alzheimer's disease. One study demonstrated that children with ADHD and conduct disorders who participated in an education program with dogs and other animals showed increased attendance, increased knowledge and skill objectives, and decreased antisocial and violent behavior compared with those not in an animal-assisted program. Shelters Every year, between 6 and 8 million dogs and cats enter U.S. animal shelters.Animals abandoned as recession hits home . TheStar.com. 22 December 2008. The Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) estimates that approximately 3 to 4 million of those dogs and cats are euthanized yearly in the United States.HSUS Pet Overpopulation Estimates The Humane Society of the United States The percentage of dogs in U.S. animal shelters eventually adopted and removed from shelters by their new legal owners has increased since the mid-1990s from around 25% to a 2012 average of 40% among reporting shelters (with many shelters reporting 60‚Äì75%). Terminology * The term dog typically is applied to the species (or subspecies) as a whole, and any adult male member of the same. * An adult female is a bitch. * An adult male capable of reproduction is a stud. * An adult female capable of reproduction is a brood bitch, or brood mother. * Immature males or females (that is, animals that are incapable of reproduction) are pups or puppies. * A group of pups from the same gestation period is called a litter. * The father of a litter is a sire. One litter can have multiple sires. * The mother of a litter is a dam. * A group of any three or more adults is a pack. Cultural depictions Dogs at Lake Balaton, depicted on the Seuso Treasure In China, Korea, and Japan, dogs are viewed as kind protectors. Mythology and religion In ancient Mesopotamia, from the Old Babylonian period until the Neo-Babylonian, dogs were the symbol of Ninisina, the goddess of healing and medicine, and her worshippers frequently dedicated small models of seated dogs to her. In the Neo-Assyrian and Neo- Babylonian periods, dogs were used as emblems of magical protection. In mythology, dogs often serve as pets or as watchdogs. Stories of dogs guarding the gates of the underworld recur throughout Indo-European mythologies and may originate from Proto-Indo-European religion. In Greek mythology, Cerberus is a three-headed watchdog who guards the gates of Hades. In Norse mythology, a bloody, four-eyed dog called Garmr guards Helheim. In Persian mythology, two four-eyed dogs guard the Chinvat Bridge. In Welsh mythology, Annwn is guarded by C≈µn Annwn. In Hindu mythology, Yama, the god of death, owns two watchdogs who have four eyes. They are said to watch over the gates of Naraka. A painting of Saint Dominic with a dog bearing a torch at his side The hunter god Muthappan from the North Malabar region of Kerala has a hunting dog as his mount. Dogs are found in and out of the Muthappan Temple, and offerings at the shrine take the form of bronze dog figurines. In Philippine mythology, Kimat, the pet of Tadaklan, the god of thunder, is responsible for lightning. The dog's role in Chinese mythology includes a position as one of the twelve animals that cyclically represent years (the zodiacal dog). Three of the 88 constellations in western astronomy also represent dogs: * Canis Major (the Great Dog, whose brightest star, Sirius, is also called the Dog Star) * Canis Minor (the Little Dog) * Canes Venatici (the Hunting Dogs) In Christianity, dogs represent faithfulness. Within the Roman Catholic denomination specifically, the iconography of Saint Dominic includes a dog, after the hallow's mother dreamt of a dog springing from her womb and becoming pregnant shortly after that. As such, the Dominican Order (Ecclesiastical Latin: Dominicanus) means \\"dogs of the Lord\\" or \\"hounds of the Lord\\" (Ecclesiastical Latin: domini canis). In Christian folklore, a church grim often takes the form of a black dog to guard Christian churches and their churchyards from sacrilege. Jewish law does not prohibit keeping dogs and other pets. Jewish law requires Jews to feed dogs (and other animals that they own) before themselves and make arrangements for feeding them before obtaining them. The view on dogs in Islam is mixed, with some schools of thought viewing it as unclean, although Khaled Abou El Fadl states that this view is based on \\"pre- Islamic Arab mythology\\" and \\"a tradition to be falsely attributed to the Prophet.\\" Therefore, Sunni Malaki and Hanafi jurists permit the trade of and keeping of dogs as pets. Literature In Homer's epic poem the Odyssey, when the disguised Odysseus returns home after 20 years, he is recognized only by his faithful dog, Argos, who has been waiting for his return.  Art  Cultural depictions of dogs in art extend back thousands of years to when dogs were portrayed on caves' walls. Representations of dogs became more elaborate as individual breeds evolved, and the relationships between human and canine developed. Hunting scenes were popular in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. Dogs were depicted to symbolize guidance, protection, loyalty, fidelity, faithfulness, watchfulness, and love.  Education and appreciation  The American Kennel Club reopened a museum called \\"Museum of the Dog\\" in Manhattan after moving the attraction from outside of St. Louis. The museum contains ancient artifacts, fine art, and educational opportunities for visitors.

Central conductor (A) is sandwiched between ground planes (B and D). Structure is supported by dielectric (C). Stripline is a transverse electromagnetic (TEM) transmission line medium invented by Robert M. Barrett of the Air Force Cambridge Research Centre in the 1950s. Stripline is the earliest form of planar transmission line.  Description  A stripline circuit uses a flat strip of metal which is sandwiched between two parallel ground planes. The insulating material of the substrate forms a dielectric. The width of the strip, the thickness of the substrate and the relative permittivity of the substrate determine the characteristic impedance of the strip which is a transmission line. As shown in the diagram, the central conductor need not be equally spaced between the ground planes. In the general case, the dielectric material may be different above and below the central conductor. To prevent the propagation of unwanted modes, the two ground planes must be shorted together. This is commonly achieved by a row of vias running parallel to the strip on each side. Like coaxial cable, stripline is non-dispersive, and has no cutoff frequency. Good isolation between adjacent traces can be achieved more easily than with microstrip. Stripline provides for enhanced noise immunity against the propagation of radiated RF emissions, at the expense of slower propagation speeds when compared to microstrip lines. The effective permittivity of striplines equals the relative permittivity of the dielectric substrate because of wave propagation only in the substrate. Hence striplines have higher effective permittivity in comparison to microstrip lines, which in turn reduces wave propagation speed (see also velocity factor) according to :v_\\\\mathrm{p} = \\\\frac{c_0}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\epsilon_{\\\\mathrm{r,eff}}}}.  History  Stripline, now used as a generic term, was originally a proprietary brand of Airborne Instruments Laboratory Inc. (AIL). The version as produced by AIL was essentially air insulated (air stripline) with just a thin layer of dielectric material - just enough to support the conducting strip. The conductor was printed on both sides of the dielectric. The more familiar version with the space between the two plates completely filled with dielectric was originally produced by Sanders Associates who marketed it under the brand name of triplate.Oliner, pp.556-559 Stripline was initially preferred to its rival, microstrip, made by ITT. Transmission in stripline is purely TEM mode and consequently there is no dispersion (provided that the dielectric of substrate is not itself dispersive). Also, discontinuity elements on the line (gaps, stubs, posts etc) present a purely reactive impedance. This is not the case with microstrip; the differing dielectrics above and below the strip result in longitudinal non-TEM components to the wave. This results in dispersion and discontinuity elements have a resistive component causing them to radiate. In the 1950s Eugene Fubini, at the time working for AIL, jokingly suggested that a microstrip dipole would make a good antenna. This was intended to highlight the drawbacks of microstrip, but the microstrip patch antenna has become the most popular design of antenna in mobile devices.Yarman, p. 67 Stripline remained in the ascendent for its performance advantages through the 1950s and 1960s but eventually microstrip won out, especially in mass produced items, because it was easier to assemble and the lack of an upper dielectric meant that components were easier to access and adjust. As the complexity of printed circuits increased, this convenience issue became more important until today microstrip is the dominant planar technology. Miniaturisation also leads to favouring microstrip because its disadvantages are not so severe in a miniaturised circuit. However, stripline is still chosen where operation over a wide band is required.Oliner, pp. 558-562  Comparison to microstrip  Microstrip is similar to stripline transmission line except that the microstrip is not sandwiched, it is on a surface layer, above a ground plane. Stripline is more expensive to fabricate than microstrip, and because of the second groundplane, the strip widths are much narrower for a given impedance and board thickness than for microstrip.

They are considered to be among the main progenitors of hardcore East Coast hip hopEdwards, Paul, 2009, How to Rap: The Art & Science of the Hip-Hop MC, Chicago Review Press, p. 323. and hip hop in the mid 1990s. Mobb Deep became one of the most successful rap duos in hip hop, having sold over 3 million records. Three of their most notable albums were The Infamous (1995), Hell On Earth (1996) and Murda Muzik (1999),Shapiro, Peter, 2005, The Rough Guide To Hip-Hop, 2nd Edition, Penguin, p. 259.[ Allmusic review] and their top hits include \\"Shook Ones (Pt.

They were known for their dark and hardcore delivery as exemplified on the track \\"Shook Ones (Part II).\\"Shapiro, Peter, 2005, The Rough Guide To Hip-Hop, 2nd Edition, Penguin, p. 258-259. The duo disbanded in 2012 but reunited in 2013. Prodigy died on June 20, 2017. Havoc is currently working on a new Mobb Deep album. Biography Early career In 1991, Havoc and Prodigy originally went by the name \\"Poetical Prophets\\" and began making a demo tape.Blisteen, Jon. Mobb Deep Rapper Prodigy Dead at 42. Rolling Stone. Accessed on March 12, 2018. They would find the addresses of record label headquarters on the back of albums, bring a cassette player, and ask passing artists to listen to their music.James, Andy. The Story of How Mobb Deep Met Q-Tip Is Amazing. DJBooth.net. Accessed on March 12, 2018. The only artist who stopped to hear their music was Q-Tip of A Tribe Called Quest; Prodigy recalled, \\"[Q-Tip] introduced us to Chris Lighty that day and a bunch of people in the Rush Associated Labels in the Def Jam office‚Äîthat's how we met everybody.\\" Shortly after, Prodigy signed a solo demo deal with Jive Records and had an uncredited feature on the song \\"Too Young\\" by Hi-Five, which appeared on the Boyz n the Hood soundtrack. Jive decided not to sign Poetical Prophets as a duo, however, they were featured in the Unsigned Hype column of The Source in July 1991, which helped promote their demo Flavor for the Nonbelievers. The following year, the duo changed their name to \\"Mobb Deep\\" and signed with 4th & B'way Records, releasing the single \\"Peer Pressure\\" in promotion of their debut album Juvenile Hell. The album was released in 1993, and later that year, Havoc made a guest appearance on the Black Moon album Enta da Stage, on a song titled \\"U da Man\\". Rise to success The group saw its first major success with their second album, The Infamous, released in 1995. Mobb Deep catapulted to the top of the hardcore hip hop scene through Havoc and Prodigy's straightforward narration of street life. In this album, Mobb Deep portrayed the struggles of living in New York City's Queensbridge Houses where Havoc grew up. Following the release of The Infamous..., Mobb Deep became some of the most prolific artists of the East Coast. The production of this album was very dark and sample-based thanks to Havoc, who produced the beats from this point forward, although Q-Tip also contributed to the production and mixing.Mobb Deep MTV, Accessed 24 July 2007 Furthermore, the hit single \\"Shook Ones Part II\\", a remix to the hit Shook Ones, received critical acclaim. Mobb Deep's third album, Hell on Earth was released in 1996 debuting at number six on the Billboard Album Chart; the album continued the duo's portrayal of harsh street life while further pushing them to the forefront of Hip Hop scene along with contemporary East Coast Rappers like The Notorious B.I.G., Jay-Z, LL Cool J, Wu-Tang Clan and fellow Queensbridge rapper Nas. Nas as well as Method Man, Ghostface Killah and Raekwon of Wu-Tang Clan appear on 'Hell on Earth'. In 1996, they appeared on the Red Hot Organization's compilation CD, America is Dying Slowly alongside Biz Markie, Wu-Tang Clan and Fat Joe among many other prominent hip hop artists. This compilation was solely meant to raise awareness of the AIDS epidemic among African American men and this compilation was heralded as \\"a masterpiece\\" by The Source Magazine, a Hip Hop publication. In 1997, Mobb Deep was featured on Frankie Cutlass \\"Politics & Bullsh*t\\" album track title \\"Know Da Game\\" which also features Kool G Rap. In 1998, the duo collaborated with reggae dancehall artist Bounty Killer on the track \\"Deadly Zone\\" for the soundtrack to Blade, and were a featured artist on the remix of Mariah Carey's single \\"The Roof (Back in Time)\\", which was based around a sample of \\"Shook Ones Part II\\". In 1999, they released the highly anticipated Murda Muzik album which, despite extensive bootlegging, had the majority of its songs unintentionally leaked. This resulted in delays in the official album release. When the album was officially released, it eventually debuted at number three on the Billboard 200 and quickly received Platinum Certification and was further promoted by the popular single \\"Quiet Storm.\\" Shortly afterward, Prodigy released his long-awaited solo album H.N.I.C in which he collaborated with fellow artists like (B.G., N.O.R.E.) and producers (including The Alchemist, Rockwilder and Just Blaze). East Coast vs West Coast feud Mobb Deep was part of the infamous East Coast vs West Coast Hip Hop rivalry that was fueled and increasingly promoted by the private media. The beef started when Snoop Dogg and the West Coast group, Tha Dogg Pound, released \\"New York, New York\\" which Mobb Deep, along with Capone-N-Noreaga and Tragedy Khadafi responded with the song \\"L.A L.A\\" (This song can be found on Capone-N-Noreaga's debut album The War Report). This song was released during rapper Tupac Shakur's final days of incarceration. Members of Tupac's group, Outlawz, allegedly attended a Mobb Deep concert; they then visited with Tupac over public rumoring that the duo had snubbed them at the concert. Tupac dissed Mobb Deep on multiple tracks, including: \\"Hit 'Em Up\\" and \\"When We Ride on Our Enemies\\" in which Tupac makes light of Prodigy's sickle-cell disease. Additional Tupac diss tracks include: \\"Bomb First (My Second Reply)\\" where Tupac said \\"You're barely breathin'\\" and \\"Against All Odds,\\" both of which were released on Tupac's posthumous studio album, The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory. Mobb Deep retaliated on their 1996 release of Hell on Earth, which contains a diss track entitled \\"Drop a Gem on 'Em.\\" ‚ÄúI was happy about it,‚Äù Havoc told Jack Thriller. ‚ÄúThe nigga saying our names. I didn't know what the fuck the beef was about. I didn't even care. I was like damn, did you hear that? 2Pac dissing us. We about to sell some records.‚Äù Havoc also revealed that Mobb Deep had never even ‚Äúcrossed paths‚Äù with Pac before his death in September 1996. He added, ‚ÄúAnd we never got a chance to cross paths with him because he passed away,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI saw him from a long distance but I never met him. [I was a] Fan, but didn't even know him.‚Äù 2000‚Äì2010 Mobb Deep released Infamy while in 2001 the song \\"Burn\\" (featuring Vita) was perceived as a response to Jay-Z's diss song \\"Takeover\\" on The Blueprint, as was \\"Crawlin',\\" in which Prodigy's two verses both mention Jay-Z. The album marked a major stylistic change in which the duo moved away from a raw, minimalist, stripped-down beat toward a commercial friendly in terms with such songs as \\"Hey Luv (Anything).\\" This transition fostered accusations of \\"selling out.\\" In 2003, the group split with Loud Records and released Free Agents: The Murda Mix Tape, in which Havoc and Prodigy proclaimed themselves \\"free agents\\" and addressed the group's split with its old label and its search for a new label. Jive Records signed the duo later in the year through a deal with the group's own imprint. Mobb Deep then released Amerikaz Nightmare in 2004. The record sold poorly and led to the group's departure from the label.Mobb Deep and Jive Records split MTV, Accessed 24 July 2007 Today, as a result of various mergers, all of Mobb Deep's studio albums from 1995 to 2004 are owned by Sony Music Entertainment. =G-Unit Records= In June 2005, Mobb Deep announced they had signed with G-Unit Records. 50 Cent had a connection to Mobb Deep as he grew up in Queens & Havoc had provided production on projects by G-Unit, Lloyd Banks, The Game & Tony Yayo. Mobb Deep released their seventh album, Blood Money in 2006. It features G-Unit members 50 Cent, Lloyd Banks, Tony Yayo & Young Buck as well as Mary J. Blige & Nate Dogg. In 2006, Mobb Deep became the first American hip hop duo to perform in India, via VH1's Hip Hop Hustle. In late 2009, Mobb Deep were released from their contract with G Unit. 2011‚Äì2017: Break-up, reunion, The Infamous Mobb Deep and death of Prodigy On April 4, 2011, Mobb Deep released a new single called \\"Dog Shit,\\" featuring rapper Nas. This was the first official song by Mobb Deep since Prodigy's release from jail. It was produced by Havoc and Alchemist. On July 27, 2012, Havoc told AllHipHop in an interview that the group was on an indefinite hiatus. According to HipHopDX, Mobb Deep had a falling out after Havoc blasted Prodigy on Twitter, and eventually, a sound clip leaked of him taking numerous shots at his former Mobb Deep partner during their concert at SXSW. At first, Havoc claimed that he was hacked. However, he later confirmed it was him and that he had originally denied it because he felt that Twitter was not a place to resolve a beef. He also stated that he had a diss track aimed at Prodigy in the making, \\"Same Shit Different Day\\". The song later turned out to be \\"Separated (Real from the Fake),\\" which appeared on Havoc's solo album 13. However, in January 2013 Prodigy said that he was sure he would record with Havoc in the future. Mobb Deep appeared on Papoose's debut album The Nacirema Dream on the track \\"Aim, Shoot\\". They later reunited and performed for Paid Dues on March 30, 2013; they went on an international 20th-anniversary tour starting in May 2013. On March 22, 2013 the group officially reunited for an interview and explained that music was the most important thing in their lives and that they had been friends for too long to break up the friendship. Around the May 2013 release of Havoc's third studio album, 13, Havoc announced that he and Prodigy had been in the studio for over a month working on the duo's eighth studio album which was already \\"halfway done.\\" He also stated that he will be doing the entire production on the album. On April 1, 2014, the group released its eighth studio album, The Infamous Mobb Deep, a double album that included one CD with original new music and one with unreleased tracks from sessions from The Infamous. On June 20, 2017 Prodigy died, while hospitalized for complications caused by sickle cell anemia, from accidental choking in Las Vegas, Nevada. Legacy Mobb Deep helped popularize the 1990s slang called the Dunn language, a term first recorded in the 1999 single \\"Quiet Storm\\", in which Prodigy raps: \\"you's a dick blower, [you] tryin' to speak the Dunn Language?/ \\"what's the drilly\\" with that though? \\"It aint bangin\\"/ you hooked on Mobb phonics, Infamous 'bonics.\\" The term \\"dunn\\" supposedly originated in the Queensbridge housing projects with an acquaintance of Prodigy's, Bumpy, whose speech impediment prevented him from pronouncing the letter \\"S\\", such as in \\"son\\". The impediment encouraged him to put the tongue on the two front teeth/palate, making a 'th' or a 'd' sound. Mobb Deep has attempted to claim ownership of this body of slang; additionally, they were going to release an album called The Dunn Language, in 2002, but the project was shelved, due to label issues. On September 15, 2018, during an interview for HipHop4Real, Havoc stated that he was working on a new album Mobb Deep, which would be the duo's latest album. He is also working on a joint project Mobb Deep with The Alchemist, announced a few years ago. In December 2019, Havoc went on a \\"Murda Muzik 20th Anniversary Tour\\" with Big Noyd and L.E.S.

An early supporter of Adolf Hitler in Coburg, Schwede used intimidation and propaganda to help elect the first Nazi-majority local government in Germany. This contributed to a personality cult surrounding Schwede and he became known as \\"Franz Schwede-Coburg\\". During World War II he ordered secret executions of the infirm and mass deportations of Jews. He also played a key role in abandoning the Pomeranian civilian population to the advancing Red Army, while escaping their fate himself. In 1945 he was captured by the British Army and in 1948 he was tried and convicted of war crimes.  Early years  Franz Schwede was born in the small town of Draw√∂hnen near Memel, East Prussia (now Dreverna near Klaipƒóda, Lithuania) in 1888, when it was part of the German Empire. He trained as a millwright and in 1907 joined the Imperial German Navy as a machinist. By the end of the First World War he had risen to the rank of technical deck officer. After the Scuttling of the German fleet in Scapa Flow in 1919, Schwede wound up in British custody as a prisoner of war. Upon his release he joined the German Army in 1920, but was discharged after the 100,000-man limit imposed by the Versailles Treaty was reached in 1921. He then took a job as operations manager at a sawmill in Sankt Andreasberg, Lower Saxony before being hired as foreman at the Coburg Municipal Works in March 1922.Erich Stockhorst: 5000 K√∂pfe.

The National Socialist Freedom Movement became its front organization and during the 1924 Coburg city council elections the Nazis managed to get 14.3% of the vote. This entitled them to 3 seats on the council and Schwede took one of them.Coburger Zeitung, 8 December 1924 retrieved 29-April-2012 After the NSDAP ban lifted in 1926, Schwede founded Der Weckruf (\\"The Wake-Up Call\\"), the first Nazi propaganda newspaper at the local level in Germany. Here he ran an extra-parliamentary opposition with lurid articles about alleged \\"scandals\\" designed to destabilize the political system of the Weimar Republic.Joachim Albrecht: Die Avantgarde des \\"Dritten Reiches‚Äú. Die Coburger NSDAP w√§hrend der Weimarer Republik 1922‚Äì1933, Frankfurt: Peter Lang, 2005, (Online) In 1928, the paper began a slander and harassment campaign against Abraham Friedmann, the jewish General Director of the Coburg meat company Gro√ümann AG. Friedmann was initially successful in fighting these attacks and managed to get the city council to fire Schwede from his job at the Municipal Works in 1929. The outraged Nazis demanded Schwede's immediate reinstatement and when the city refused a petition began circulating to dissolve the City Council. On 5 May 1929 the recall passed with 67% of the vote. In the ensuing re-election campaign, which included public speeches in Coburg by Adolf Hitler himself, the Nazi's won 43.1% of the popular vote and 13 of the 25 seats on the city council in June 1929. This was the first instance where the NSDAP held an absolute majority in a local government in Germany.Coburger Zeitung, 24 Juni 1929 retrieved 29-April-2012 At the newly elected Council's opening session, Schwede was promptly rehired to the Municipal Works. He then managed to get himself elected, after the fifth try, as third deputy mayor (B√ºrgermeister) on 28 August 1930, becoming the first Nazi to reach such a position. Early in 1931 he was elected second B√ºrgermeister and, on 16 November 1931, first B√ºrgermeister. Coburg became the first city in Germany to see the swastika flag raised on a public building, City Hall, which occurred on 18 January 1931 two years before Hitler came to power. Schwede also got the city to grant Hitler an honorary citizenship on 16 October 1932, also the first to do so. All this created a cult of personality around Schwede, a highlight of which was the 1933 dedication of Coburg City Hall's new bell, bearing the rhyming inscription Zu Adolf Hitler ruf ich dich, Franz Schwede-Glocke hei√üe ich (roughly translated \\"To Adolf Hitler I call, I am called the Franz Schwede Bell\\"). Following the Nazi Seizure of Power in January 1933, Schwede was directly appointed as Coburg's Lord Mayor (Oberb√ºrgermeister). In March 1933, a terror campaign was launched against Jews and opponents of the Nazis under his leadership. By the end of April, 152 people had been arrested and harshly mistreated while in \\"protective custody\\", many in Schwede's presence.Harald Sandner: Coburg im 20. Jahrhundert. Die Chronik √ºber die Stadt Coburg und das Haus Sachsen-Coburg und Gotha vom 1. Januar 1900 bis zum 31. Dezember 1999 ‚Äì von der \\"guten alten Zeit‚Äú bis zur Schwelle des 21. Jahrhunderts. Gegen das Vergessen. Verlagsanstalt Neue Presse, Coburg 2002, , p. 117. In 1939 Coburg was officially granted the title \\"First National Socialist City in Germany\\" (). Schwede was also made an honorary citizen of Coburg, as Hitler had been, and was awarded use of the suffix \\"Coburg\\" in his name.Initiative Stadtmuseum Coburg e.V.: Voraus zur Unzeit. Coburg und der Aufstieg des Nationalsozialismus in Deutschland, Coburg 2004,  Gauleiter of Pomerania  In 1934 Schwede's political career rose further. He had already won election to a seat in the Bavarian Landtag in 1930 and to the Reichstag in 1933. On 1 July 1934, he was appointed district president of Lower Bavaria/Upper Palatinate. Around the same time the existing Gauleiter of the Prussian Province of Pomerania, Wilhelm Karpenstein, ran afoul of NSDAP headquarters and was arrested during the Night of the Long Knives. Schwede's loyalty was rewarded when Hitler appointed him to the powerful Gauleiter position in Pomerania on 21 July 1934 and made him Oberpr√§sident on 30 July.Werner Buchholz: Pommern: Deutsche Geschichte im Osten Europas Siedler, 1999, , pp.500-512Gauleiter Schwede zum Oberpr√§sidenten vom Pommern ernannt. Frankfurter Zeitung, 31 July 1934. Thus Schwede united under his control the highest party and governmental offices in the province. Schwede moved to Stettin, forced 23 of the 27 District Kreisleiters out of office, and replaced Karpenstein's staff with loyal friends from Coburg, including: Arno Fischer as state building surveyor, Kuno Popp as Gau propaganda leader and regional representative of the Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda, Alfred Seidler as Gau treasurer, Johannes K√ºnzel as a regional representative of the German Labor Front, Emil Mazuw as SS- Stabsf√ºhrer of SS District XIII Pomerania, and Werner Faber as Lord Mayor of Stettin.Kyran T.

In May 1937 Schwede was promoted to SA- Gruppenf√ºhrer and in November 1938 to SA-Obergruppenf√ºhrer.Karl H√∂ffkes: Hitlers Politische Generale. Die Gauleiter des Dritten Reiches: ein biographisches Nachschlagewerk. Grabert-Verlag, T√ºbingen 1986, p. 311, That same year, he became Chairman of the Reich League of Former Professional Soldiers (). During 1938-39, the German Pomeranian province was enlarged. Most of Grenzmark Posen-West Prussia and two counties in Brandenburg were made a district, further expanding the area he controlled. During the Reichskristallnacht on 9 November 1938, Schwede oversaw the destruction of the Pomeranian synagogues. The next day, all male Stettin Jews were deported to Oranienburg concentration camp and kept there for several weeks in order to increase the level of terror.  World War II and war crimes  At the outbreak of World War II, Hitler gave the Gaulieters increased power over their regions and Schwede was appointed Reich Defense Commissar () for Defense District II. Civil administration and important industrial sectors were now subject to his direct control. Starting in October 1939, Schwede ‚Äì or \\"Nero\\" as the Pomeranians nicknamed him ‚Äì used this position to sweep Pomerania with an iron broom. He worked closely with the SS to make way for the resettlement of ethnic Germans arriving from the Baltic States.Ian Kershaw: Hitler 1936-1945: Nemesis New York: W.W. Norton & Company, 2000, p. 261 Google Books link After learning of the Aktion T4 program, he immediately ordered the evacuation of psychiatric hospitals and nursing homes in Treptow, Ueckerm√ºnde, Lauenburg, Meseritz-Obrawalde and Stralsund. Patients were transported to Neustadt in Westpreu√üen to be shot by SS-Kommando Eimann or murdered by Sonderkommando Lange in gas vans.Ernst Klee: \\"Euthanasie‚Äú im NS-Staat. Die \\"Vernichtung lebensunwerten Lebens‚Äú, Frankfurt am Main: S. Fischer Verlag, 1983, , p. 95‚Äì98. On 12 and 13 February 1940, the remaining 1,000 to 1,300 Pomeranian Jews, regardless of sex, age and health, were deported from Stettin and Schneidem√ºhl to the Lublin-Lipowa Reservation that had been set up following the Nisko Plan, to their ultimate demise. In 1943 Pomerania became a target of allied air raids and throughout 1944 and early 1945 Stettin's industrial and residential areas were hit. Despite this, the province was regarded as \\"safe\\" compared to other parts of the Third Reich and it became a shelter for evacuees from hard hit Berlin and the industrial areas of western Germany. Pomerania finally turned into a battlefield on 26 January 1945, when Red Army tanks entered the province near Schneidem√ºhl during the East Pomeranian Offensive. Schwede believed in victory up until the very end, so evacuation orders for the civilian population were issued either too late or not at all. He even ordered authorities to repel any flight attempts as \\"defeatist\\". However, even as the Soviets advanced, he managed to get himself onto a ship out of Sassnitz on 4 March 1945 in time to escape towards the direction of Schleswig-Holstein. The official post-war West German Schieder commission estimated civilian losses in Schwede's province at 440,000 dead.Figures from: Die Vertreibung der deutschen Bev√∂lkerung aus den Gebieten √∂stlich der Oder-Nei√üe, volume 1, edition from 1984, page 7 E, 158 E, 159 E  Imprisonment and death  On 13 May 1945, Schwede was captured by the British Army and once again ended up in custody as a prisoner of war. Interned until 1947, he was tried for war crimes in a Bielefeld court and on 25 November 1948 sentenced to nine years in prison for membership in the SA-F√ºhrerkorps. On 7 April 1951 a court in Coburg sentenced him to another ten years' imprisonment on 52 counts of abuse of power and grievous bodily harm that he participated in during the terrors of March, 1933. His sentence was commuted to probation on 24 January 1956 on grounds of ill health and he died four years later at the age of 72 in Coburg.Stefan N√∂th: Antisemitismus. In: Voraus zur Unzeit.

Creation myth At the beginning of creation, the only things in existence were Areop-Enap (a spider) and the sea. Areop-Enap searched for food in the darkness and found an enormous clam (in some accounts a Tridacna clam). Before he could stun it, the clam swallowed him and snapped shut again. In the darkness, Areop-Enap explored the clam's insides, and found a tiny snail (or in some accounts, a Triton's Horn shellfish). Areop-Enap placed the snail under his arm and lay down and slept for three days, directing some of his power to the snail. Then he found a second, larger snail which he placed under his arm and again slept for three days, transferring some of his power to the snail. On waking, Areop-Enap asked the smaller snail to climb to the hinge of the shell and pry the clam open. As the snail moved across the clam's flesh, it left a phosphorescent trail, in the light of which Areop-Enap saw a white worm (or in some accounts, a caterpillar) called Rigi. Ignoring the snail, Areop-Enap cast a strength spell on Rigi and persuaded him to try to open the clam. Time and again Rigi set his head against the upper shell and his tail against the lower shell, and heaved. The clam resisted and sweat poured from Rigi, making a pool in the lower shell, then a lake and finally a sea. The saltiness of the water killed the clam and opened the shell. Areop-Enap made the lower shell into Earth and the upper shell into the sky and set the smaller snail west of the sky-shell where it became the Moon. The second snail was set to the east and became the Sun. Areop-Enap made islands from clam-flesh and clothed them in vegetation made from his own web-thread. Finally he turned to Rigi and found that he had drowned in his own sweat, killed by his own exertions. Areop-Enap wrapped him in a cocoon of silk and hung him in the sky to become the Milky Way. Areop- Enap created humans from stones so they could support the sky, and then discovered there were other creatures in the newly created world. So he created a winged creature or flying bird from the dirt under his nails and set it to annoy the creatures so that they called to each other to kill it. In this way Areop-Enap learned the names of the inhabitants of the world.

The channel is bounded on the west by the Antarctic Peninsula and on the east by James Ross Island. It is about long and ranges from wide. On 27 February 1995, the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) reported that an ice shelf formerly blocking the channel had disintegrated. This ice shelf had spanned approximately prior to its disintegration.Correll, Robert C. (1998). Our Changing Planet, p. 90. DIANE Publishing. In the area previously covered by the shelf, the channel's water depth is between . Between February and March 2000, scientists collected sediment cores 5 to 6 m in length from the ocean floor. Carbon dating of organic material found in the sediment layers suggested that for a period between 2,000 and 5,000 years ago, much of the channel was seasonally open water. While icebergs were able to navigate the channel, ice rafted debris was deposited within the sediment.

The period when the channel was open coincides with a period of local warming supported by data gathered from land-based studies of lake sediments and ancient, abandoned penguin rookeries. With the return of colder conditions about 1900 years ago, the Prince Gustav Ice Shelf reformed until its recent retreat and collapse. Ice shelves are sensitive indicators of regional climatic change, therefore recent warming in the vicinity of the Prince Gustav Channel is exceptional for at least the past 1900 years.  San Nicol√°s Refuge  San Nicol√°s Refuge () is an Argentine Antarctic refuge located on the north coast of the entrance to the Prince Gustav Channel, on the Trinity Peninsula, at the northern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula. The refuge is administered by the Argentine Army and was inaugurated on September 12, 1963.

Camp Records' releases typically consisted of parodies of existing songs or musical styles, primarily revised folk melodies with the lyrics rewritten to reflect a camp sensibility. The arrangements were usually simple, consisting of spare instrumentation and multiple-voice harmonies, but ranged in style from cocktail piano bar to Latin exotica. The songs themselves comically portrayed the world of the American homosexual subculture, often relying on broad stereotypes, gay slang, and saucy double entendres for their comic effect. As an example, their single \\"Li'l Liza Mike\\" rewrote the lyrics to the popular musical standard \\"Li'l Liza Jane\\" to tell of a man's befuddlement at the behavior of his butch lesbian girlfriend. The song was credited to \\"Byrd E. Bath & the Gay Blades,\\" which was the most common byline for the label. Another release, \\"I'd Rather Fight Than Swish\\", was written in the rollicking style of early rock and roll, and featured a swaggering, Elvis Presley-style lead singer. The song's lyrics told of a macho outlaw biker's desires to physically assault effeminate gay men, but as the song progresses it makes clear that the biker himself is a closeted homosexual. The song's title is a play on the then-new Tareyton cigarette ad slogan \\"Us Tareyton smokers would rather fight than switch!\\"; the record was available in 1964. \\"I'd Rather Swish Than Fight\\" was the B-side, featuring an effeminate counterpoint to the A-side. Their single \\"Stanley the Manly Transvestite\\" was credited to a singer named \\"Rodney Dangerfield\\" who was not the comic of the same name; the choices of stage name were coincidencidental. (The comic Dangerfield expressed bewilderment about the record in an interview with Hustler shortly before his 2004 death, stating in response to a question about \\"Stanley the Manly Transvestite:\\" \\"How do they start these rumors? Jesus Christ! ... I'm not singing that.\\") The pseudonym had previously been used in a fictional context by Jack Benny and Ricky Nelson. Camp Records released two full-length LPs: The first, The Queen Is in the Closet consisted of ten songs, compiling some of the singles and B-sides along with others in their style. The second was called Mad About the Boy. Mad About the Boy was a concept album consisting of a number of straightforward cover versions of mainstream popular jazz torch songs in which women sing of their romantic feelings toward men; the Camp Records release simply rerecorded these songs with male vocalists without changing the song's use of gender, resulting in love songs sung by men to men. An open letter promoting the record in beefcake magazines explained the concept: \\"Gender, should not be the determining factor as to who should sing what. Many singers have all too often been frustrated by lyrics not being acceptable to them because of text.\\" As Camp Records' releases all date back to the early 1960s, and none were published with a copyright notice, the text and music of the songs have now passed into the public domain. Under state common law, which protects sound recordings separately, the state of California may provide some protection for the records should a claimant ever come forward. To date, the authors remain unknown; public materials protected the anonymity of those involved with Camp Records but did hint that some of the performers were famous: \\"you will recognize the stylings of some very fine and well-known personalities (...) the vocal group used in this production is make up of four of the better known Hollywood T.V. and screen personalities.\\" See also * List of record labels References External links * Queer Music Heritage has posted the complete recordings of Camp Records available as MP3s, as well as the company's cover art.

Biblioth√®que nationale de France, Paris. Camel wrestling (Turkish deve g√ºre≈üi) is a sport in which two male T√ºl√º camels wrestle, typically in response to a female camel in heat being led before them. It is most common in the Aegean region of Turkey, but is also practiced in other parts of the Middle East and South Asia. History Camel fighting originated among ancient Turkic tribes over 2,400 years ago. Camels also wrestle in the wild, so the practice occurred before it was first organized by nomads. In the 1920s the Turkish National Aviation league has held Camel fights as fundraisers in order to purchase planes for the Government of Turkey. The government of Turkey began discouraging the practice in the 1920s, however, characterizing it as too backwards of a practice. In the 1980s the new government of Turkey began encouraging the competitions as part of Turkey's historic culture. Camel wrestling was also a popular event at the Lahore Horse Event details Due to the motivating factor of a nearby female camel, the events have historically been held during mating season. The camels fight by using their necks as leverage to force their opponent to fall down. A camel is declared the winner if his competitor falls to the ground or flees from the fight. Most fighting camels are bred in Iran or Afghanistan. A successful camel can be sold for over $20,000. The events can occasionally be hazardous to spectators if the camels attempt to flee through the crowd. On some occasions fights also break out between the owners of camels. There are roughly thirty annual festivals in Aegean Turkey each year from November to March. Roughly one hundred fighting camels take part in these events, with each camel competing in approximately ten matches. Events always occur on Sundays in football stadiums and typically last ten minutes each. At the end of the season there is often a tournament of champions in which the best camels compete. Many international tourists attend the events, making them a key part of the tourist industry in Western Anatolia. Several animal rights organizations have criticized the practice, characterizing it as cruelty to animals.

The physical layer is responsible for physical transmission of the data, link encapsulation allows local area networking, Internet Protocol (IP) provides global addressing of individual computers, and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) selects the process or application, i.e. the port which specifies the service such as a Web or TFTP server. During encapsulation, each layer builds a protocol data unit (PDU) by adding a header (and sometimes trailer) containing control information to the SDU from the layer above. For example, in the Internet protocol suite, the contents of a web page are encapsulated with an HTTP header, then by a TCP header, an IP header, and, finally, by a frame header and trailer. The frame is forwarded to the destination node as a stream of bits, where it is decapsulated (or de- encapsulated) into the respective PDUs and interpreted at each layer by the receiving node. The result of encapsulation is that each lower layer provides a service to the layer or layers above it, while at the same time each layer communicates with its corresponding layer on the receiving node. These are known as adjacent-layer interaction and same-layer interaction, respectively. In discussions of encapsulation, the more abstract layer is often called the upper layer protocol while the more specific layer is called the lower layer protocol.

Claims that blond hair would disappear have been made since 1865. Cites Chamber's journal of popular literature, science and arts By William Chambers, Robert Chambers, 1865 (p. 408), as well as newspaper mentions from 1890, 1906, and 1961. 1906 reference relates to a newspaper report on a lecture by Major C. E. Woodruff called The Disappearance of Blond Types from the American Population, mentioned in MacCurdy GG, Anthropology At The New York Meeting, Science, 26 April 1907: 653‚Äì665 Several reports erroneously claimed that the World Health Organization (WHO) had published a report claiming that people with blond hair \\"will become extinct by 2202\\". Neither the WHO nor any reputable expert had issued such a report, and so those who commented on the alleged report were asked by the WHO to retract.A corrected version of \\"Cavegirls were first blondes to have fun\\" by Sunday Times, February 26, 2006 In the media In 2002 BBC News reported that unnamed German experts had concluded that the natural distribution of blond hair would cease within the span of 200 years owing to the genes associated with blond hair being recessive. The article reported the scientists had said that there is a reportedly low number of people carrying the recessive blond allele, especially in nations of mixed heritage (for example, the United States, Canada, Argentina, Brazil, New Zealand and Australia). The dominant alleles (brown hair, black hair, brown eyes) \\"overthrow\\" the recessive genes or metaphorically, endanger them. Subsequently the study was attributed to the World Health Organization. In the BBC article Prof. Jonathan Rees of the University of Edinburgh cast doubt on the story‚Äîhe was quoted as saying \\"The frequency of blondes may drop but they won't disappear.\\"\\"Blondes 'to die out in 200 years'\\", from the BBC, September 27, 2002. In October 2002 The New York Times reported that the World Health Organization had no knowledge of this study. \\"Hair-raising story about blonds cut short\\", from The Age, October 3, 2002WHO clarification In 2006 the hoax was mentioned by The Sunday Times when reporting on the publication of a hypothesis of the origins of blonde hair Cavegirls were first blondes to have fun. The online version was corrected later. and La Repubblica: \\"According to the WHO study, the last natural blond is likely to be born in Finland during 2202.\\" It once again traveled quickly across the World Wide Web. \\"Natural blondes are likely to be extinct within 200 years\\" from Bit of News The hoax has also been featured on the \\"Threat-Down\\" segment of the satirical television show The Colbert Report on March 6, 2006, where Stephen Colbert suggested a selective breeding program to save blonds.Threat Down Colbert Report. 6 March 2006  Scientific position  The extinction hoax is based on a misinterpretation of recessiveness in genetics. In reality, gene frequency is stable unless there is selection for or against them, which does not appear to be the case for blonde hair. In large populations, even extremely rare genes will persist at stable levels over long periods of time. It also does not matter whether a gene is dominant or recessive. Genes disappear if the population is very small (drift) or if they confer a disadvantage (selection).

Many Chinese people disembarked in the port towns of South Australia before travelling overland to the Victorian goldfields due to immigration restrictions in Victoria. Chinatown in Adelaide began to grow in the 1970s and 1980s with the influx of Asian migrants particularly from Vietnam. Produce was sold at the Central Market by market gardeners and this began the growth of the Asian food shops and caf√©s in the area. Pagoda style roofs, red lanterns, restaurants and grocery stores are found on Moonta Street, which is the centre of Chinatown. Paifang, which is a type of traditional Chinese archway, are at the opposite entrances of Moonta street and are guarded by Chinese lion statues which were donated by the Adelaide city council and by the Chinese government. Lunar New Year Celebrations Chinatown Adelaide has hosted the official Lunar New Year Celebrations in Moonta Street since 2003.

While no one was killed in the vehicle-ramming attack, nine people were injured (none seriously). Shortly after the attack, he turned himself in and was arrested. He pleaded guilty to nine counts of attempted first-degree murder, and in 2008 was sentenced to 33 years in prison, on two counts of attempted murder. In one letter, Taheri-azar wrote, \\"I was aiming to follow in the footsteps of one of my role models, Mohamed Atta, one of the 9/11 hijackers, who obtained a doctorate degree.\\" He told investigators he wanted to \\"avenge the deaths or murders of Muslims around the world.\\" Attack During the attack A similar Grand Cherokee to the one involved in the attack On the afternoon of March 3, 2006, Taheri-azar drove a rented silver 2006 Jeep Grand Cherokee through a common courtyard area of campus known as the Pit, a high-traffic area centered between the student bookstore, student center, dining hall, and libraries. It is a popular gathering spot, filled not only with students going to and from class, but also with participants in various student organization-related activities. While not readily accessible to vehicular traffic beyond a narrow service road, the barricades that normally prevent cars from approaching the Pit were not in place on the day of the attack. His top speed was estimated by witnesses to be from . He struck nine pedestrians, six of whom were taken to the hospital for treatment and released. The other three declined to be treated. After the attack After the incident, Taheri-azar drove to Plant Road, a nearby city street, and called 911 to turn himself in to authorities. He calmly confessed to perpetrating the attack. He told the dispatcher his location and requested that he be arrested. He told the dispatcher that the reasons for his actions were outlined in a letter which he left on his bed in his Carrboro apartment. Taheri-azar then gave himself up upon the arrival of police at the scene. Later that afternoon, officials evacuated the apartment complex where Taheri- azar lived, then stormed the unit while media helicopters circled overhead. Along with the letter described in the 911 call, officials found his UNC diploma folded in his closet, and the Carolina blue graduation gown used just three months before. On March 6, 2006, when he appeared in an Orange County courtroom, he stated that he would defend himself, and that he looked forward to the opportunity of sharing the law of Allah. He was charged with nine counts of attempted first-degree murder and nine counts of assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill inflicting serious bodily injury before being held in Central Prison in Raleigh on a $5.5 million bond. On May 3, 2006, a grand jury indicted him on nine counts of attempted first-degree murder, four counts of assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill, and five counts of assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill inflicting serious injury. The case will go to superior court next, for either a trial or a plea. Early on, the FBI was involved in the investigation, but the exact involvement was unknown. Perpetrator Although Taheri-azar was born in Tehran, the capital of Iran, he is a naturalized U.S. citizen who moved to the United States at the age of two. He grew up in the Charlotte, North Carolina area, where he lived with his mother and younger and older sisters. He attended South Mecklenburg High School in Charlotte, where he was a socially- awkward honor student who graduated in 2001. He had a proclivity for fast and expensive cars, and the South Mecklenburg High School yearbook dubbed him the \\"South's Speedster.\\" He received four tickets between 2001 and 2003 for \\"unnecessary honking, driving down the middle of two lanes of traffic, and failure to obey directions at a police checkpoint,\\" and for \\"traveling at in a zone.\\" He enrolled in the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2001, where he majored in psychology and philosophy. At one point he dropped out, but returned the following semester. In college, he volunteered at local hospitals. He graduated from UNC in December 2005. Some of those who knew him there described him as \\"a serious student, shy but friendly,\\" and \\"kind and gentle, rather than aggressive and violent\\". A student who had been in the same history of philosophy class said he was \\"impressed\\" with Taheri-azar's \\"knowledge of classical Western thought.\\" He was serious about his grades, and served briefly as the president of the UNC psychology club. However, not all of those who knew him had the same opinion. UNC Chancellor James Moeser described him as \\"totally a loner, introverted, and into himself\\". Fellow Muslims characterized Taheri-azar as \\"cantankerous and unorthodox in his practice of Islam\\" and \\"anything but traditionally devout.\\" During prayers on campus he \\"wouldn't pray toward Mecca and refused to recite prayers in Arabic ‚Äì contrary to standard Islamic practice.\\" One Muslim student, Atif Mohiuddin, recalled Taheri-azar as being \\"anti-Arabic\\" and never using the standard Arabic greeting of Assalaamu Alaikum. UNC professor Charles Kurzman noted that Taheri-Azar had very little knowledge about Islam, not even knowing the difference between Sunnis and Shias or that al-Qaeda, where his role model Muhammad Atta came from, does not recognize him as a follower of the faith because he is Shia. Aftermath Local Muslim leaders condemned the attack and the attempt by the assailant to link the Qur'an to his actions. While UNC Chancellor James Moeser described Taheri-azar's attack as one of violence in an internal email to the university community, he stopped short of calling it a full-fledged act of terror. An official \\"Reclaim the Pit\\" event occurred on March 20, 2006, where students gathered for a moment of silence. On August 26, 2008, Taheri-azar was sentenced on two counts of attempted murder to 26 years and 2 months to 33 years in prison by Orange County Superior Court. As of March 2016, he is projected to be released in April 2032.Pit driver: ‚ÄòI am genuinely sorry‚Äô for 2006 rampage , Bradley Saacks, The Daily Tar Heel, March 2, 2016.

The EWC was established on 1 October 2007 and superseded the Wheat Export Authority (WEA). The EWC was a statutory commission operating under the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997. Funding and role The EWC's role was determined by the Wheat Marketing Act 1989 (the Act) and its operations were funded from three sources: 1\\\\. Wheat Export Charge In June 2003, the Wheat Marketing Act 1989 was amended to make provision for the introduction of a Wheat Export Charge (WEC) on all Australian wheat exports. The WEC came into effect by regulation on 1 October 2003 and was set at 22 cents per tonne. It remained at that level during the reporting period. Income provided by the WEC for the EWC in 2007‚Äì08 was AUD1,191 million (representing 33% of total funding requirements) compared with AUD2.208 million (61%) in 2006‚Äì07, and AUD3.321 million (97%) in 2005‚Äì06. The Primary Industries (Customs) Charges Regulations 2000, made under the Primary Industries (Customs) Charges Act 1999, provided for the collection of the WEC. The WEC was collected by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry's Levy and Revenue Service which charged the EWC for the administration of its collection and disbursement and exporter payment compliance. This service cost AUD1,660 per month in 2007‚Äì08, compared with AUD1,830 per month in 2006‚Äì07 and AUD2,080 in 2005‚Äì06. 2\\\\. Export Application Fee In August 2003, an amendment to the Wheat Marketing Regulations 1990 established a AUD50 fee on all export consent applications. This made up a minor proportion of EWC income. During 2007‚Äì08 export application fees amounted to AUD950, compared to AUD15,000 in both 2006‚Äì07 and 2005‚Äì06. 3\\\\. Additional Funding As income through the WEC was significantly reduced due to the drought and reduced wheat exports in 2006‚Äì07, the Government provided a grant of AUD2 million in September 2007 to allow the agency to continue operating until 31 March 2008. This grant covered ongoing operational costs and the transition from the former Wheat Export Authority to the EWC. The EWC's financial position was transferred to Wheat Exports Australia on 1 July 2008 under the Wheat Export Marketing Act 2008. The EWC facilitated the operations of Australia's legislated wheat export arrangements and informed Government and growers of outcomes. The EWC: * controlled the export of bulk wheat from Australia; * monitored and reported on AWB International's performance in relation to the export of wheat from the National Pool (also referred to as the single desk marketing system); * monitored compliance with the conditions of export consents; * administered the Non-bulk Wheat Quality Assurance Scheme; and * managed operations efficiently and effectively, consistent with corporate governance principles, and * informed stakeholders of its activities. The EWC assumed responsibility for the role of the former Wheat Export Authority to monitor and report on Australia's single desk wheat export arrangements, under which AWB (International) Ltd (AWB(I)) was given a near monopoly on exporting wheat, in particular bulk exports. The 2007/08 National Pool was the last one to be managed by AWBI. Overview The Export Wheat Commission (EWC) was established as an Australian Government statutory authority on 1 October 2007, under the Wheat Marketing Act 1989 (the Act) after legislative changes in June 2007. This Overview is based on the EWC's Corporate Plan 2007‚Äì08 and the Portfolio Budget Statement 2008‚Äì09. Vision The EWC vision was for a sustainable, innovative and internationally competitive wheat export sector that continued to provide optimal returns for growers and develop Australia's broader interests. Mission The EWC facilitated the operations of Australia's legislated wheat export arrangements and informed Government and growers of outcomes. About The EWC was an Australian Government agency within the Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry portfolio. It operated under the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 and was required to meet related financial management and reporting requirements. EWC staff were employed under the Public Service Act 1999. The EWC comprised a Chairman and four other Commissioners, appointed for a period of up to three years by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. The Commissioners were supported by a Secretariat which comprised up to 16 full-time staff headed by a Chief Executive Officer (CEO). The Commissioners were responsible for fulfilling the statutory requirements of the EWC. The Secretariat assisted the Commissioners in meeting their obligations. The Commissioners carried out major decision-making functions and provided guidance to the Acting CEO who had delegated authority to undertake many of the functions and responsibilities of the EWC. Day-to-day control over core areas of EWC activity rested with a small executive team who worked closely with Secretariat staff. Primary functions  Under the Act the EWC had three functions: * to control the export of wheat from Australia (other than the export of wheat in bags or containers) * to monitor AWB International Limited's (AWBI's) performance in relation to the export of wheat and examine and report on the benefits to growers that result from that performance * to undertake such other functions as administered by the Commission ‚Äî such as the Non-bulk Wheat Quality Assurance Scheme, that commenced on 27 August 2007. Operations In delivering those functions the EWC: * provided assurance to stakeholders that the export performance of AWBI and the returns to growers were independently and accurately monitored * increased stakeholder awareness and confidence in the performance monitoring of AWBI * received and independently assessed bulk wheat export applications from non-AWBI exporters, and made recommendations to the Minister * granted export consents as directed by the Minister * monitored and reported on non-AWBI exporter compliance with the conditions of export consents * responded to stakeholder needs and changes in the EWC's operating environment and contributed to the ongoing development of Australia's wheat export arrangements * managed operations effectively, consistent with Australian Government corporate governance principles, and sought to inform stakeholders about the EWC and its activities. People The Minister Under the Act, the EWC was required to provide the Minister with a report on its monitoring of AWBI's export performance and the impact on growers. Known as the Performance Monitoring Report (PMR), it contained considerable commercial-inconfidence information. With the late closing of the 2005/06 National Pool, the EWC produced a 2007 PMR Addendum report to the Minister. The EWC was also required to notify the Minister of significant wheat export related events and to keep the Minister informed on the EWC's operations. The EWC also provided the Minister with a Corporate Plan and an Annual Operational Plan (AOP) during the year. The EWC presented the Annual Report 2006‚Äì07 for the former Wheat Export Authority to the Minister who tabled it in Parliament on 13 May 2008. Under the Act, the Minister held the power of veto over bulk wheat exports until 30 June 2008. The EWC processed applications to export wheat in bulk in line with the published Export Consent Guidelines and referred these to the Minister for decision. Growers The EWC reported to growers on the non commercial-in-confidence findings of the PMR activity through the Growers Report. The Growers Report was published on the EWC website and mailed to more than 25,000 growers. In addition, with the late closing of the 2005/06 National Pool, the EWC published the Growers Report 2007 Addendum which was similarly distributed to growers. Stakeholders Beyond meeting its legislated requirements to the Minister and growers, the EWC was also committed to delivering and communicating results to other stakeholders in Australia's wheat export arrangements. The EWC's key stakeholders were: * the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry * Australian wheat growers * AWB International Ltd * Australian wheat exporters. Other stakeholders included: * grower bodies, such as the Grains Council of Australia (GCA) and the Grain Growers Association (GGA) * State grain merchant associations (representing small to medium grain businesses) * various industry and exporter organisations, such as the Australian Grain Exporters Association (AGEA) * large and small exporters * independent grain consultants * other Australian Government departments and agencies with an interest in the grain industry and related transport and export arrangements. Non-bulk Wheat Quality Assurance Scheme By 30 June 2008 the EWC had accredited: :‚Ä¢ 62 packing companies (in 103 locations in five States) :‚Ä¢ 12 laboratories (in 31 locations) :‚Ä¢ 6 superintendence companies (in 18 locations). By 30 June 2008, the EWC had received 4,094 notification forms for the export of 1,929,293 tonnes to 41 countries. The EWC's performance also included the following results: * The development of an online service enabling wheat exporters to electronically submit their notification forms and contracts to the EWC. This streamlined the notification process and reduced processing time for both the EWC and the exporter, and enabled exporters to forward the information to packers and laboratories. * Following deregulation, non-bulk exporters were able to export wheat in containers to overseas customers that they were previously unable to supply under the former export consent application arrangements. * This also meant exporters could better align grain quality with specific customer requirements. * Some non-bulk exporters developed stronger links with growers New directions The November 2007 Federal election resulted in a change of Government and reform of Australia's wheat marketing arrangements towards the liberalisation of exports in bulk. This reform included the release of draft legislation and a Senate Committee Inquiry into the Wheat Export Marketing Bill 2008 and the Wheat Export Marketing (Repeal and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2008. The related drafting of a new Wheat Export Accreditation Scheme for bulk exports, became a major focus for the EWC and the industry during the reporting period. The EWC monitored and reported on AWBI's export performance in managing the National Pool and presented the Minister with two Performance Monitoring Reports (PMRs) and published two Growers Reports. This was a significant result as the Act only required the EWC to produce one performance monitoring report to the Minister and one related report to growers during the year. Legislative change On 5 March 2008, the Minister released an exposure draft of the Wheat Export Marketing Bill 2008. The EWC was required to undertake considerable preliminary work on new governance and other arrangements in the lead-up to the establishment of the new body, Wheat Exports Australia. The changes presented new challenges for the EWC, including a requirement to draft a legislative instrument to create an accreditation scheme for bulk exporters. The EWC consulted widely with industry in formulating the Wheat Export Accreditation Scheme (Bulk-Scheme), undertaking preliminary consultations in March and then releasing an exposure draft of the Scheme in June. In June 2008, the Government passed legislation in Parliament that reformed the export of wheat in bulk, ending the wheat export monopoly arrangement held by AWBI since privatisation of the Australian Wheat Board in 1999. Other outcomes The EWC significantly improved its performance in all areas of its ongoing business while successfully meeting the new demands of the legislative changes and without undue disruption to the export wheat industry. The EWC continued to refine its business processes in its key functional areas of bulk export consents, administration the Non-bulk Wheat Quality Assurance Scheme (Non-bulk Scheme) and the performance monitoring of AWBI. At the direction of the Minister, the EWC also completed three Ministerial investigations during the reporting period. During 2007‚Äì08, the EWC received and assessed a total of 54 applications for bulk exports, consulting with AWBI and providing detailed comments and recommendations to the Minister. The Minister approved six applications for 950,000 tonnes in five markets. The EWC ensured that its consent compliance requirements for bulk wheat exports were met by exporters. Following the liberalisation of wheat exports in containers and bags on 27 August 2007, the EWC administered the Non-bulk Scheme and during the reporting period, accredited 62 packers with 103 sites, 12 laboratories with 31 sites and six superintendence companies with 18 sites. The EWC also processed and checked more than 4,000 packer notifications of exports in bags and containers and ensured they complied with the Non-bulk Scheme. The EWC liaised with industry and grower organisations in relation to the Non-bulk Scheme during the year and introduced a new online notification form to increase efficiency for users as well as the EWC. The EWC also continued to liaise with the Australian Customs Service and non-AWBI exporters on compliance with non-bulk export consents given by the former Wheat Export Authority prior to deregulation. Ministerial directions During the previous reporting period, 1 October 2006 to 30 September 2007, the Minister had directed the former Wheat Export Authority to conduct one investigation under section 5DC of the Act. The EWC presented two interim reports and then delivered its final report on the investigation to the Minister on 14 December 2007. During the reporting period the Minister gave the EWC directions to undertake two further investigations (see page 59). While these placed additional requirements on the Secretariat, I am pleased to advise that these were concluded in an efficient and timely manner. The EWC presented its findings to the Minister in two confidential reports. Performance monitoring Due to the late closure of the 2005/06 National Pool, the EWC produced two reports on the performance of AWBI instead of the required one. The EWC delivered the 2007 PMR to the Minister in December 2007, in accordance with its requirements under the Act. This 177-page report was adapted into a 28-page report to growers, with the commercial-in-confidence elements removed. The EWC subsequently produced a 108-page commercial-in-confidence Addendum to the PMR and then published a 20-page Addendum to the Growers Report 2007 during 2007‚Äì08 to inform the Minister and growers on the performance of AWBI and a number of other topical wheat industry issues. Drought had a major impact on growers and exporters during the 2007/08 harvest which yielded 13.04 million tonnes, although this was 2.23 million tonnes above the 2006/07 harvest. The EWC statistics showed that approximately 5.4 million tonnes of wheat were exported during 2007/08. Western Australia and South Australia were the major wheat exporting States. On 1 July 2008, following the passage of legislative change, the EWC was replaced by Wheat Exports Australia.

As director general of the Royal Prussian palaces and parks in Potsdam and Berlin, his work shaped the development of 19th-century German garden design in the Neoclassical style. Laid-out according to the principles of the English landscape garden, his parks are today part of the UNESCO World Heritage. Life and works Lenn√© was born in Bonn, then part of the Electorate of Cologne, the son of the court and university gardener Peter Joseph Lenn√© the Elder (1756‚Äì1821), and his wife, Anna Catharina Potgieter (also Potgeter), daughter of the mayor of Rheinberg. The Lenn√© family descended from the Prince-Bishopric of Li√®ge, Peter Joseph's ancestor Augustin Le Neu had settled in Poppelsdorf near Bonn as court gardener of Archbishop-Elector Maximilian Henry of Bavaria about 1665. Childhood and development Having obtained his Abitur degree, Peter Joseph Lenn√© decided to adopt the family tradition. He began his apprenticeship as a gardener in 1808 with his uncle, Josef Clemens Weyhe, court gardener at the electoral Augustusburg and Falkenlust Palaces, Br√ºhl. At the instigation of his father, he also took university courses in botany. From 1809 to 1812, Lenn√© took many study trips, paid for by his father, which took him to Southern Germany, to France, and to Switzerland. In 1811, he completed a long internship in Paris with Gabriel Thouin, who was then one of the most famous garden architects in Europe. This made him a master landscaper. On another of these trips, Lenn√© made the acquaintance of the creator of the English Garden in Munich, the landscape gardener Friedrich Ludwig von Sckell, who would have a lasting influence on Lenn√©'s work. Assistant gardener  The Glienicke Hunting Lodge Park with views to the Lion Fountain at Glienicke Palace In 1812, Lenn√© followed his father to Koblenz, where he had been named Director of the Gardens by the Prefect Jules Doazan. Later in that year, Lenn√© became active at Schloss Sch√∂nbrunn, where he would remain until 1814. He then returned to Koblenz, where he was given private garden commissions until 1815. Extensions to the city's fortifications gave him an opportunity to propose a plan for its beautification by the addition of gardens; however, this was not carried out because of lack of funds. In 1816, he returned to Potsdam at the suggestion of Prussian forestry official Georg Ludwig Hartig and General Graf von Hacke. There he received the position of Assistant Gardener to the Court Garden Director at Sanssouci. While still working as an assistant gardener, in spring 1816 Lenn√© received a commission from the Prussian Chancellor Karl August von Hardenberg to renovate the grounds around his country house at Klein-Glienicke. This work on Glienicke Palace, which would later become Prince Carl of Prussia's residence, laid the groundwork for Lenn√©'s designs for the surrounding area of Potsdam, which he wanted to turn into a Gesamtkunstwerk. The upgrades of the Glienicke grounds were followed - in close cooperation with the architects Karl Friedrich Schinkel, Ludwig Persius, and Ferdinand von Arnim - by those of others such as the B√∂ttcherberg and facing it Babelsberg Park, which was completed by Prince Hermann von P√ºckler- Muskau. Characteristic of Lenn√©'s work are versatile sight axes - a horticultural stylistical device - which he applied at Sanssouci Park and elsewhere. As part of the Berlin-Potsdam cultural landscape, which stretches from the Pfaueninsel to Werder, many sites of Lenn√©'s work are World Heritage Sites and have been under the protection of UNESCO collectively since 1990. Prussian Garden Director-General The accomplishments of the garden architect are reflected in his career progression. In 1818 he was an employee of the Royal Garden Authority, and in 1822, he received a promotion to Gardening Director. That same year, Lenn√© became a founding member of the Prussian Society for the Promotion of Horticulture. Lenn√© also accepted the position of Manager of the Division of Orchard Cultivation and later of the Parks Division. Bust in Landschaftspark Petzow In 1823, the Gardener Academy in Sch√∂neberg and Potsdam was founded under his management. Here garden architecture was taught in a scientific manner for the first time. In 1828, Lenn√© was named the sole Garden Director and in 1845, Prussian Garden Director-General. The Prussian Academy of Arts made Lenn√© an honorary member. In 1840, the recently enthroned King Friedrich Wilhelm IV assigned the urban planning of Berlin to Lenn√©. One of his most important achievements in this role survives in the building of the Luisenstadt Canal, constructed in 1852, between the Landwehrkanal and the River Spree in Kreuzberg. The canal's design was based on plans by Chief Building Officer Johann Carl Ludwig Schmid. Despite centering his life around Potsdam and Berlin, Lenn√© remained attached to his Rhenish homeland and contributed to the further beautification of Koblenz, particularly in the Rheinanlagen, which was under his management until 1861. His love of his work on the Rhine and Mosel made him decide to build the residence named for him, the Lenn√©-Haus, in which he wished to spend the evening of his life; however, the manner of his death did not allow this. Lenn√©'s last resting place is at the Bornstedt Cemetery in Potsdam. Busts of Peter Joseph Lenn√© are located at the Bonn Botanical Garden, on the bank of the Rhine (Alter Zoll), in the Landschaftspark Petzow that he himself designed, in Feldafing Park, in Park Sanssouci, and in the Kaiserin-Augusta- Anlagen in Koblenz (copy of a bust by Rauch). A recent bust was finished by Bad Homburg sculptor Otto Weber-Hartl.

The title translates as \\"Moon of Xelaj√∫\\". \\"Xelaj√∫\\" (pronounced sheh-lah- HOO) is the K'iche' Maya name for the Guatemalan city Quetzaltenango, still often popularly called \\"Xelaj√∫\\" or \\"Xela\\". The song was written to Miss Eugenia Cohen, a beautiful Jewish lady who stole the writer's heart, but eventually left him because Eugenia's parents disapproved of the relationship. She lives in Quetzaltenango and Guatemala City to this day. All of the great marimba bands of Guatemala have played it to great success. Perhaps one of the most popular recent versions is as the first selection of the CD Valses inolvidables de Guatemala, with the Guatemalan Millennium Orchestra under the baton of Maestro Dieter Lehnhoff. The song has been performed by several musical acts, including Guatemalan singer and Grammy Award nominee, Gaby Moreno.

It is moored on the River Thames at Hampton in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames. Gilmour purchased the boat in 1986, because he \\"spent half of [his] life in recording studios with no windows, no light, but on the boat there are many windows, with beautiful scenery on the outside\\".  Early history  The boat was built in 1911 for impresario Fred Karno who wanted to have the best houseboat on the river permanently moored alongside his hotel, the Karsino at Tagg's Island. He designed it so that an entire 90-piece orchestra could play on deck. The boat is framed in mahogany and has mainly Crittall windows with taller, wider windows towards one end. It is topped by very ornate metalwork canopies and balustrades.  Gilmour era  Gilmour bought the boat after seeing it advertised for sale in a copy of Country Life magazine in his dentist's waiting room, just a short while after admiring it while being driven past its moorings. Parts of each of the last three Pink Floyd studio albums, A Momentary Lapse of Reason (1987), The Division Bell (1994), and The Endless River (2014), were recorded on the boat, as were parts of Gilmour's solo album On an Island (2006). His most recent solo album, Rattle That Lock (2015), was mixed and partially recorded there. It was also used for mixing the Pink Floyd live album Pulse (1995) as well as the Pulse film (1995), Gilmour's Remember That Night DVD/Blu-ray (2007) and his Live in Gda≈Ñsk (2008) live album/DVD. Bob Ezrin has mentioned, however, that the floating studio posed a few problems when it came to engineering guitar sounds for A Momentary Lapse of Reason: A video of Andrew Jackson, sitting at the mixing console of the Astoria Studio, is available online. Numerous photographs taken in 1993 of the band recording The Division Bell on board the Astoria appear on the sleeve of the 2014 Pink Floyd album, The Endless River.  Footage  Dara √ì Briain, Griff Rhys Jones and Rory McGrath visited the floating studio/house while rowing up the Thames for the BBC television programme Three Men in a Boat. Gilmour's rendition of William Shakespeare's Sonnet 18 (\\"Shall I compare thee to a summer‚Äôs day?\\"), set to piano, was also filmed on the Astoria.  Equipment  According to an interview with Phil Taylor (Gilmour's guitar technician),Tape Op Magazine #46 (Mar/Apr 2005) the studio on the Astoria was originally equipped with a DDA AMR 24 mixer console and UREI 813 studio main monitors with Phase Linear amps. The UREI 813s were replaced around 1990 by ATC main monitors. Customised ATC SCM150ASL active speakers are used for the main left and right channels with a standard ATC SCM150ASL active speaker used as the centre channel. The centre channel sits above an ATC SCM0.1‚Äì15 subwoofer. The surround monitors are two ATC SCM50ASLs. A variety of near- field monitor speakers are used including Yamaha NS-10s and Auratones depending on who happens to be working at the studio. The acoustic design was done with the assistance of Nick Whitaker, an independent acoustician, and much of the equipment was recommended by James Guthrie and Andrew Jackson. Nowadays the Astoria has a Neve 88R mixing console, as well as three Studer A827 multi-tracks and Ampex ATR-100 tape recorders, which were modified by Tim de Paravicini, Esoteric Audio Research's (EAR) founder. The conversion to a studio also required 14 miles (23 km) of cables, which were sourced from Van den Hul cables of Holland. There are various compressors from Pye and EAR 660 tube designs, as well as EAR 825s for EQ.

It belongs to a class of antiplatelet named glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors. Tirofiban is a small molecule inhibitor of the protein-protein interaction between fibrinogen and the platelet integrin receptor GP IIb/IIIa and is the first drug candidate whose origins can be traced to a pharmacophore-based virtual screening lead. Medical use Tirofiban is administered via intravenous infusion and is indicated to reduce the rate of thrombotic cardiovascular events (combined endpoint of death, myocardial infarction, or refractory ischemia/repeat cardiac procedure) in patients with non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS). Contraindications and precautions Tirofiban is contraindicated in patients with: * Known hypersensitivity to any component of tirofiban. * History of thrombocytopenia with prior exposure to tirofiban. * Active internal bleeding, or history of bleeding diathesis, major surgical procedure or severe physical trauma within the previous month. Cautions * Tirofiban can cause serious bleeding. If bleeding cannot be controlled discontinue tirofiban. * Thrombocytopenia: Discontinue tirofiban and heparin. Adverse reactions Bleeding is the most commonly reported adverse reaction. Use in pregnancy Tirofiban has been demonstrated to cross the placenta in pregnant rats and rabbits. Although the doses employed in these studies were a multiple of those used in human beings no adverse effects on the offspring in both animals have been seen. However, there are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Therefore, tirofiban should be used during pregnancy only if clearly indicated. Nursing mothers: It is not known whether tirofiban is excreted in human milk. However, significant levels of tirofiban are excreted in rat milk. Therefore, nursing should be discontinued during the period of drug administration and the milk discarded. Nursing may resume 24 hours after cessation of treatment with tirofiban. Pediatric use Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established. Other precautions and laboratory exams The activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is .the most reliable coagulation parameter and should be obtained regularly during treatment, particular if a bleeding episode occurs that may be associated with tirofiban therapy. Other important hematological parameters are platelet count, clotting time, hematocrit and hemoglobin. Proper technique regarding artery site access for sheath placement and removal of sheath should be followed. Arterial sheaths should be removed when the patient's activated clotting time is < 180 sec. or 2 to 6 hours following. withdrawal of heparin. Side effects The following side effects were noted under treatment with tirofiban and heparin (and aspirin, if tolerated). Other drugs were used as necessary. The major adverse effect is bleeding on local sites of clinical intervention and systemically (regarding parts of the body or the whole body system). Major bleeding has occurred in 1.4% of patients and minor bleeding in 10.5%. Transfusions were required to terminate bleeding and to improve bleeding-related anemia in 4.0% of all patients. Geriatric patients have experienced more bleeding episodes than younger, women more than men. Thrombocytopenia was more often seen in the tirofiban + heparin group (1.5%) than in the heparin control group (0.8%). This adverse effect was usually readily reversible within days. Positive fecal and urine hemoglobin tests have also been reported. Post-marketing events have been the occurrence of intracranial bleeding, retroperitoneal bleeding, pulmonary hemorrhage and spinal-epidural hematoma. Fatal bleeding have been reported rarely. Sometimes, thrombocytopenia was associated with chills, low- grade fever or bleeding complications (see above). Cases of hypersensitivity including anaphylaxis have occurred.  Interactions  The concomitant application of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants may increase the risk of serious bleeding events. The decision whether maintenance therapy with these drugs should be discontinued during tirofiban treatment has to be made by the responsible clinician. Pharmacology Tirofiban has a rapid onset and short duration of action after proper IV administration. Coagulation parameters turn to normal 4 to 8 hours after the drug is withdrawn. Chemistry Tirofiban is a synthetic, non-peptide inhibitor of the interaction of fibrinogen with the integrin glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa on human platelets. The Merck chemistry team of George Hartman, Melissa Egbertson and Wasyl Halczenko developed tirofiban from a lead compound discovered in focused screening of small molecule replacements of the key arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (Arg-Gly-Asp) subunit of fibrinogen. Computation of the distance between the charged Arg and Asp sites in fibrinogen provided guidance leading to directed screening success. Tirofiban constitutes an antithrombotic, specifically an inhibitor of platelet aggregation. Tirofiban is a modified version of a molecule found in the venom of the saw-scaled viper Echis carinatus. History The drug is marketed under the brand name Aggrastat in the US by Medicure Pharma, in China by Eddingpharm, and in the rest of the world by Correvio International S√†rl.

Restored ship chandlery, , at the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic in Halifax, Nova Scotia A distinguishing feature of a ship chandler is the high level of service demanded and the short time required to fill and deliver orders. Commercial ships discharge and turn around quickly, delay is expensive making the services of a dependable ship chandler in great demand. Advantages, today and in the past, are that stores in unfamiliar ports do not need to be sought out (assuming the crew is allowed to leave by immigration authorities) and lines of credit make exchanging of currency a non-issue. (Usually a ship owner would establish a line of credit with the chandler and then be billed for anything delivered to the crew.) Chandlers also deliver the product, freeing up crew to work on repairs or, if allowed, take shore leave. The ship chandlery business was central to the existence and the social and political dynamics of ports and their waterfront areas.Stinchcombe, Arthur L.

In 1931, because of the collectivization, the parents of A.V. Pogorelov escaped from the village to Kharkiv, where his father become a worker at the construction of the Kharkiv tractor plant. In 1935, A.V. Pogorelov won the first prize at the Mathematical Olympiad in Kharkiv State University. After high school graduation in 1937, he entered the mathematical department of the Kharkiv State University. He was the best student at the department. In 1941, after involving of the Soviet Union into the Second World War, Aleksei Vasil'evich was sent for 11 months study to N.Y. Zhukovsky Air Force Engineering Academy. During his studies, the students periodically were sent for several months to the front as technicians for the airplane service. After the Red Army Victory over Nazi near Moscow, the training continued for a full term. After academy graduation, he worked at N.Y. Zhukovsky Central Aero-hydrodynamic Institute (TsAGI) as a design engineer. The desire to complete university education and specialize in geometry professionally led A.V. Pogorelov to Moscow State University. By recommendation of I.G. Petrovsky (Dean of the Mechanics and Mathematics Department) and a well-known geometer V.F. Kagan, Aleksei Vasil'evich met A.D. Aleksandrov ‚Äì the founder of the theory of non-smooth convex surfaces. There were many new questions concerning this theory. Aleksandr Danilovich proposed to give an answer to one of them to A.V. Pogorelov. In a year the problem was solved and A.V. Pogorelov was enrolled to the graduate school of the Mechanics and Mathematics Department of Moscow State University. Nikolai Efimov became his scientific advisor on topics of Aleksandrov theory. After defending his Ph.D. thesis in 1947, he was demobilized and moved to Kharkiv, where he started to work at the Institute of Mathematics of Kharkov State University and the Geometry Department of the university. In 1948 he defended his doctoral thesis. In 1951 he became the Corresponding Member of the Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, in 1960 he became the Corresponding member of the USSR Academy of Sciences (Division of Physical and Mathematical Sciences). In 1961 he became an Academician of the Academy of Sciences of Ukraine. In 1976, he became an Academician of the USSR Academy of Sciences (Mathematics Division). From 1950 to 1960 he was the Head of the Geometry Department at Kharkiv State University. From 1960 to 2000 he was the Head of the Geometry Division at the Verkin Institute for Low Temperature Physics and Engineering of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine. Since 2000 he lived in Moscow and worked at the Steklov Mathematical Institute. He died on December 17, 2002 and was buried in Moscow at the Nikolo-Arkhangelsk cemetery.

By the thirties, there were developed the methods for solving the problems in geometry \\"in the large\\". These methods were related mainly to the theory of partial differential equations. Mathematicians were helpless when surfaces were non-smooth (for example, with conical points, ribbed points, etc.) and when the intrinsic geometry was given not by a smooth positive definite quadratic form, but simply by a metric space of a fairly general form. A breakthrough in the study of non-smooth metrics and non-smooth surfaces was made by an outstanding geometer A.D. Aleksandrov. He developed the theory of metric spaces of non- negative curvature, so-called Aleksandrov metric spaces. As a special case, the theory covered the intrinsic geometry of general convex surfaces, that is boundaries of convex bodies. Aleksandrov studied connections between the intrinsic and extrinsic geometries of general convex surfaces. He proved that every metric of non-negative curvature given on a two-dimensional sphere (including non-smooth metrics, so-called inner metrics) can be isometrically immersed into the three-dimensional Euclidean space in a form of a closed convex surface, but the answers to the following fundamental questions were unknown: #is this immersion unique up to rigid motion? #if the metric given on the sphere is a regular one and of positive Gaussian curvature, is it true then that the surface with this metric is regular? #G. Minkowski proved an existence theorem for a closed convex surface with the Gaussian curvature given as a function of a unit normal under some natural condition on this function; the open question was: if the function is regular on a sphere, is the surface regular itself? After solving these problems, the theory created by Aleksandrov would have received ‚Äúfull citizenship‚Äù in mathematics and could be applied also in the classical regular case. Each of these 3 questions was answered positively by A.V. Pogorelov. Using synthetic geometric methods, he developed geometric methods to obtain priori estimates for solutions of Monge- Amp√®re equations. On the one hand, he used these equations to solve geometric problems; on the other hand, based on geometric reasons, he constructed a generalized solution of a Monge-Amp√®re equation and then proved its regularity for a regular right-hand side of the equation. In fact, in these pioneering works A.V. Pogorelov laid the foundation of the field of geometric analysis. He proved the following fundamental results: #Let F1 and F2 be two closed convex isometric surfaces in the three-dimensional Euclidean space or in a spherical space. Then the surfaces coincide up to the rigid motion. #A closed convex surface in a space of constant curvature is rigid outside flat domains on it. This means that the surface admits only trivial infinitesimal bendings. #If the metric of a convex surface is regular of regularity –°–∫, k‚â•2, in a space of constant curvature –ö* and the Gaussian curvature of the surface satisfies –ö>–ö*, then the surface is –°–∫-1,Œ±. For domains on convex surfaces assertions 1) and 2) are false. The local and global properties of surfaces are significantly different. By proving assertion 1) A.V. Pogorelov completed the solution of the problem open for more than a century. The first result in this direction was obtained by Cauchy for closed convex polyhedra in 1813. The theorems proved by Pogorelov formed the basis for his nonlinear theory of thin shells. This theory is concerned with those elastic states of the shell which differ significantly comparing to the original form. Under such deformations, the middle surface of a thin shell undergoes bending with preservation of the metric. This makes it possible, by using theorems proved by Pogorelov for convex surfaces, to investigate loss of stability and the over critical elastic state of convex shells under a given strain. Such shells are the most common elements of modern designs. Results 1) and 2) were generalized for regular surfaces in a Riemannian space. In addition, the Weyl problem for Riemannian space was solved: it was proved that a regular metric of Gaussian curvature greater than some constant c on a two-dimensional sphere can be isometrically immersed into a complete three-dimensional Riemannian space of curvature k, k‚â•3, then the support function will be of regularity class –°k+1,v, 0 \\\\det (z_{ij})=f(x_1, \\\\dots, x_n, z, z_1, \\\\dots, z_n). A priori estimates in the Minkowski problem are a priori for the solution of the Monge- Amp√®re equation with the function : f=\\\\frac 1{K(1+x_1^2+\\\\cdots+x_n^2)^{\\\\frac n2+1}}. At that time there was no approach to studying this completely nonlinear equation. A. V. Pogorelov has created the theory of the Monge-Amp√®re equation by using the geometric methods. First, going from polyhedra, he proved the existence of generalized solutions under natural conditions on the right-hand side. After that he has found the a priori estimates for the derivatives up to the third order inclusively for the regular solutions. Using the a priori estimates, he has proved the regularity of strictly convex solutions, the existence of solutions of the Dirichlet problem and their regularity. The Monge-Amp√®re equation is an essential component of the Monge- Kantorovich transport problem; it is used in conformal, affine, K√§hler geometries, in meteorology and in financial mathematics. A.V. Pogorelov once said about the Monge-Amp√®re equation: this is a great equation with which I had the honor to work. One of the most conceptual works of A. V. Pogorelov refers to the cycle of works about smooth surfaces of bounded external curvature. A.D. Aleksandrov created a theory of general metric manifolds that naturally generalize Riemannian manifolds. In particular, he introduced the class of two-dimensional manifolds of bounded curvature. They exhaust the class of all metrized two-dimensional manifolds that admit, in a neighborhood of each point, a uniform approximation by Riemannian metrics with absolute integral curvature (i.e., the integral of the module of Gaussian curvature) bounded in aggregate. Naturally, the question arose about the class of surfaces in three-dimensional Euclidean space carrying such a metric with preservation of connections between the metric and the extrinsic geometry of the surface. Partially answering this question, A.V. Pogorelov introduced the class of –°1-smooth surfaces with the requirement on the area of a spherical image to be bounded, taking into account the multiplicity of the covering in some neighborhood of each point of the surface. Such surfaces are called surfaces of bounded extrinsic curvature. For such surfaces there is also a very close connection between the intrinsic geometry of the surface and its extrinsic shape: a complete surface with a bounded extrinsic curvature and a nonnegative intrinsic curvature (not equal to zero) is either a closed convex surface or an unbounded convex surface; a complete surface with zero intrinsic curvature and bounded extrinsic curvature is a cylinder. The first work of A. V. Pogorelov on surfaces of bounded extrinsic curvature was published in 1953. In 1954, J. Nash published the paper on –°1-isometric immersions, which was improved by N. Kuiper in 1955. It follows from these studies that a Riemannian metric defined on a two-dimensional manifold, under very general assumptions, admits a realization on a –°1-smooth surface in a three-dimensional Euclidean space. Moreover, this realization is carried out as freely as a topological immersion into the space of the manifold on which the metric is given. Hence it is clear that for –°1-surfaces, even with a good intrinsic metric, it is impossible to preserve the connections between the intrinsic and extrinsic curvatures. Even in case if a –°1-surface carries a regular metric of positive Gaussian curvature, then this does not imply the local convexity of the surface. This emphasizes the naturalness of the class of surfaces of bounded external curvature introduced by A. V. Pogorelov. A. V. Pogorelov solved Hilbert's fourth problem, set by D. Hilbert at the II International Congress of Mathematicians in Paris in 1900. He found all, up to isomorphism, realizations of the systems of axioms of classical geometries (Euclid, Lobachevsky and elliptic) if one omits the congruence axioms containing the concept of angle and supplement these systems with the axiom of \\"triangle inequality\\". A. V. Pogorelov was one of the first who has proposed (in 1970) a new idea in the construction of a cryoturbogenerator with superconducting field winding and took an active part in technical calculations and creation of corresponding industrial samples.

One BRET is the equivalent of one day worth of average human exposure to background radiation. The unit is also referred to as BERT (Background Equivalent Radiation Time). BRET units are used as a measure of low level radiation exposure. The health hazards of low doses of ionizing radiation are unknown and controversial, because the effects, mainly cancer and genetic damage, take many years to appear, and the incidence due to radiation exposure can't be statistically separated from the many other causes of these diseases. The purpose of the BRET measure is to allow a low level dose to be easily compared with a universal yardstick: the average dose of background radiation, mostly from natural sources, that every human unavoidably receives during daily life. Background radiation level is widely used in radiological health fields as a standard for setting exposure limits. Presumably, a dose of radiation which is equivalent to what a person would receive in a few days of ordinary life will not increase his rate of disease measurably.

Farbige kemik aus Assur, Fig. 29, s.24 Assyrian folk dances are mainly made up of circle dances that are performed in a line, which may be straight, curved, or both. Most of the dances allow unlimited number of participants, with the exception of the Sabre Dance, which require three at most. Assyrian dances would vary from weak to strong, depending on the mood and tempo of a song. Assyrian folk dances belong to five metric groups: (10 dances), (6 dances), (13 dances), (1 dance), (1 dance). The tempo would usually range from slow (70 beats per minute) to very fast (140 beats).Stauder, W. Harfen Und Leiern Vorderasiens im Babylonischer under Assyrischer Zeit, s. 51-55, 36-38 Technique Lore clothing may be worn in the folk dance. All Assyrians dances, with the exception of the Sabre Dance, are done in a connected circle. Most Assyrian line dances are itinerant dances and move laterally. In an open floor space, the lines assume open circular shapes where they tend to curve and acquire spiral shapes as determined by floor space availability.Engel, Carl. The Musik of the most ancient nation, London, 1864. There are only five ways of moving the body; Step, leap, run, hop and jump. The legs are also used to stamp, stomp and kick. The arms are used predominantly and they'd usually move independently of the legs. Arm gestures include bouncing, swinging forward and back, moving side-to-side, lifting above the head and clapping. In many dances, the torso, along with the shoulders and arms, bounce up and down rhythmically. Stomps and stamps are also executed in Assyrian folk dances. Knee bends, deep squats and leg extensions are a regular occurrence in Assyrian dance.Anca Giurchescu, Sunni Bloland; Romanian Traditional Dance; Wild Flower Press; Mill Valley, California; 1995 The connections include, hand-to-hand, hand to shoulder, and hand to hip, with hand-to-hand being the most popular. The hand-to-hand type has three connections; The \\"W\\", the \\"V\\" and the \\"T\\". The \\"W\\" arm hold is the most common where the arms are raised into the \\"W\\" position (or, at least, it appears to look like the letter W). The \\"T\\" dance is where hands are placed on other participants's shoulders. This is the least common dance of the three.Subhi Anwar Rashid, Mesopotamien, Abb 137  Dances  Fast pace *Siskany: The Siskany dance involves the participants briskly shaking their shoulders where they move their limbs energetically, with an emphasis on their feet in a zippy manner. Sometimes the khigga beat is geared up to this to indicate a climactic end. The pulsating tempo is consanguineous to the electronic dance music and dance-pop found in western music. The dance technique is virtually like the khigga one, albeit it is in a faster fashion. Alternatively, a simpler form involves the dancers plainly going forwards and backwards to the beat with stomps, as if they are rocking or swinging. It is mostly danced by Iraqi Assyrians, and was first initiated by Chaldean Christians. The dance goes by the time signature of and the tempo is around 120-135bpm. *Gubbare: Mostly danced at the end of a party. The music is fast, lively and upbeat, akin to a jig. The music accompanying the dance is typically in the major key. Pinkies interlock, dancers repeatedly go forward and back in motion in the circle. Popular song in a gubareh beat is Tom Tom by Linda George. Gubareh is in and its tempo is around 125-135bpm. *Bablaka: Fervently danced, with pinkies interlocking, where they (hands and arms too) move up and down energetically and perennially.Rudolf Laban, The Mastery of Movement; Boston: Plays; 1950. But unlike gubareh, the participant is more stable where they will not prance forward and backwards in the dance floor. Motion is intemperately focused on arms, shoulders and hands in bablaka. Dancers may also rhythmically bend knees. The beat is virtually homogeneous to gubareh. It also danced at the end of parties. The meter is and tempo is around 125-130bpm. *Belaty: The dance is accompanied by a moderately fast- paced Arabic rhythm (similar to belly dancing music). Dancers would connect hand-to-hand in the circle, lift legs to the beat whilst making a slight leap and kick their legs to the sides in the air (this would repeat). An example of a notable song with a belaty beat is Ahela Yoni by Ashur Bet Sargis. Becoming somewhat rare and unwonted recently, songs traditionally in its rhythm are now played and danced to in the Bagiyeh or Peda beat. The beat is 125-135bpm. . *Tolama: Lively and energetic dance where the participants constantly jump and kick legs in the air repeatedly (similar in fashion to belaty and gubareh), whilst also moving their torso forward and backwards. It also danced at the end of parties after Gubbareh, but it is not as commonly practiced as Gubbareh. Notable song in this beat is Shoshonla by Shamiram Urshan. The time signature is and temp is 125-140bpm. *Sabre dance: A solo dance that usually involves one to three participants. As the dance starts, the sword bearer dances by himself, waving his sword and holding his shield (a shield is optional, though). The dance represents the symbolic surrender of the bride to the groom and his family. In weddings, it is performed by the closest male relatives of the couple. The rhythm is a duple meter, and this gives a \\"springy\\" feeling to the dance.Subhi Anwar Rashid, Mesopotamien (Musikgeschichte in Bildern, Leipzig 1984, S. 130 Abb 147 Moderate pace Assyrian youth in folk costume dancing khigga. *Khigga: The simplest and most common dance beat in Assyrian music. Individuals hold hands with the line or circle following around the dance floor where they gently move one leg forward, backward and repeat with the next leg. Its music is the first beat that is played when welcoming the bride and groom to the reception hall. A notable song with this beat is Moralon by Evin Agassi. Furthermore, the term khigga is also occasionally used to denote all the Assyrian folk circle dances, i.e. \\"Khigga'd belaty\\" (\\"khigga of belaty\\"), \\"khigga'd gubareh\\", etc. It is generally danced from right to left by Iraqi and Iranian Assyrians. Khigga goes by the time signature of with moderate tempo between 105-115bpm. **Heavy Khigga (Khigga Yaqoora): Virtually the same dance as above, except the tempo is 'heavier' where the participants would make more ardent and exaggerated moves, as its name suggests, namely knee bending. It is not to be confused with Siskani, as that dance beat is faster and has distinguishing techniques. It is danced from right to left by Assyrians from Iraq and Iran, and left to right by Assyrians from Syria. Connection is always made by hands. Examples of songs having this beat is Zayno Mala by David Simon. Heavy khigga goes by the time signature of with tempo between 115-120bpm. **Khigga'd Suria (Syrian Khigga): Danced by Assyrians from Syria, it is a standard khigga that is generally accompanied by a faster beat, usually at around 110-120bpm. Dancers connect by pinkies, where they repeatedly wave their connected pinkies whilst taking a few steps forwards and one step backwards. It is generally danced from left to right. The dance technique is similar to gubareh, but it lacks the fast-paced multiple forward-steps and leg kicking. It is danced during the entrance of the bride and groom at weddings. *Tanzara: Legend has it that the dance was brought to Anatolia by the Ancient Assyrians during their conquest of the region in the Assyrian empire in commemoration to the god of food and vegetation. Dancers connect by holding hands in the circle or line, go forwards and backwards by making a little knee bending. Uncommon than above dances. The time signature is and tempo is 115-125bpm. *Kochari: The notable attribute of this dance is that the participants are connected by arms-on-arms (akin to dabke). Each leg makes a kick in a repetitive manner. Common among Assyrians in Syria. Very rare among other Assyrians. , 110-120bpm Slow pace * Sheikhani: One of the older dances, Sheikhani is laid-back, albeit bouncy, and slightly slower than khigga. The main movement is two-step. The two-step begins with the right foot (right-left-right) and is then repeated with the left foot (left-right-left). Hands are interlocked, left arm is bent at the elbow and pressed against the back, right arm held forward against the back of the dancer in front. The dancers go forward a couple steps in, with their arms at their sides and at the same time, kick into the center. After that, they immediately step back out. A notable song with a sheikhani beat is Wye Wye Minakh by Sargon Gabriel. Sheykhani is in time signature and is 90-105bpm. *Bagiye: Evolved from Sheikhani, Bagiyeh has a move where the dancers slowly turn to face the back of the dancer in front or side of them, leisurely kick both legs in the air, then brusquely raise hands into air whilst making a sharp rotation. The dancers would turn to the right; their hands are hooked to one another by the fingers, the right arm is bent in front of the body, and the left arm is bent in behind the back. Although similar, bagiye is sluggish and more onerous than sheikhany. There is a homogeneous variant of this dance called Peda with particularised sets of songs, popularised by singer-songwriter Adwar Mousa in Syria. The dance beat has gotten popular in the late 2000s and 2010s, with songs traditionally in the belaty rhythm being incorporated into this beat. Notable song with a bagiyeh beat is Yalekhta by Linda George. Notable song affiliated with peda is Narineh by Sargon Gabriel. Bagiyeh is in time signature and is 80-95bpm. *Georgina: A Kurdish-inspired dance that's slow-paced and usually accompanied by sentimental ballads (one popular song being Zereneh by Janan Sawa). The music tends have a Turkish and Kurdish flavour. Dancers hold the pinkie or little finger and move them rhythmically (akin to bablaka, albeit gently). It is more common among Chaldean Assyrians. The tempo is around 70bpm-80bpm. . *Chobi: A modern circle dance found in Iraqi music. It is participated by Iraqi Assyrians. The dance is similar to khigga, but it would have more pronounced leg elevation and swaying, making it more difficult. Each leg swiftly kicks to the air and repeats. Arms sway forwards and backwards. Songs may usually be in Iraqi Arabic, but a few Assyrian songs such as Teela Teela by Evin Agassi would have this rhythm. The tempo is around 95bpm-100bpm.Subhi Anwar Rashid, The History of Musical Instruments in Old Iraq, Fig. 41 (In Arabic) *Arabanoo: A slow circle dance where dancers interconnect with pinkies and sway tardily around in a circle. Mostly practiced among Urmian Assyrians. It is not to confused with Georgina as this dance is slower and more serene in comparison. Aywateh by Evin Agassi utilizes this beat. Uncommon. , 52-66bpm *Azia Tamma: Similar to sheikhani in terms of pace, but with more steps that go forward and backwards (or reverse) a notch. Not common. , 82-88bpm Other dances These Assyrian folk dances are rarely danced, but they're still practiced within some tribes and/or special events: *Akmale *Azrabukeh: , 116-126bpm *Bet- Karkhan *Beriyo *Chalakhan: , 126-132bpm *Demale: , 63-69bpm *Dimdimma: or , 72-76 (), 118-122bpm () *Hareigooleh: , 116-124bpm *Hoberban: , 130-134bpm *Janiman: , 60-66bpm *Mamer: , 122-130bpm *Janiman: , 60-66bpm *Hoberban: , 130-134bpm *Mamyana: , 68-74bpm *Shapshapa *Shara: , 92-100bpm *Sinjiyeh *Zingirta: , 120-150bpm Gallery Audio Audio excerpts of each Assyrian common dance style: File:Khigadance.oggA modern Khigga beat with a moderate dance tempo, backed up by electronic drums and synthesizers.

He played for the Cleveland Spiders, St. Louis Perfectos, Milwaukee Brewers, Chicago White Stockings, Pittsburgh Pirates, and St. Louis Cardinals. Burke was the regular third baseman for the Cardinals from 1903 to 1905. He was named player-manager in the middle of the 1905, season but was replaced by Stanley Robison after amassing a record of 34‚Äì56. Playing career Burke made his debut in October of 1898 for the Cleveland Spiders. He was one of many players moved from Cleveland to St. Louis the following season, a move that stocked Cleveland with inferior and inept ball players that resulted in that team producing the worst record ever in Major league baseball. Burke only played a couple of games for St. Louis, now called the St. Louis Perfectos. In 1901, he split time between the Milwaukee Brewers and Chicago White Sox of the American League. After being released by Chicago in 1901, he signed with the National League's Pittsburgh Pirates where once again he played only occasionally. Burke never got anywhere near close to regular playing time until he was traded by Pittsburgh to the St. Louis Cardinals. In 1903, his first season with significant playing time, he batted .285 and rove in 42 runs. However, despite in appearing in over hundred games in both of the next seasons, Burke found himself playing for the Kansas City Blues in the minor leagues. Burke never again played in the majors, finishing his career with the Fort Wayne Champs of the Central League in 1913.https://www.baseball- reference.com/register/player.fcgi?id=burke-004jam Coaching From 1914 through 1917, Burke was a coach for the Detroit Tigers. He then served as manager for the St. Louis Browns from 1918 through 1920. In 1921, he became a coach for the Boston Red Sox, a position he held for three seasons. Burke later was a coach for the Chicago Cubs from 1926 through 1930, and was last a coach with the New York Yankees from 1931 through 1933.

The name is a local one, not formally conferred on the building. Instead it refers to the fact that the building was designed for and initially occupied by Voplex Corporation, a supplier of automotive custom plastic products such as interior trim. A sign with the name \\"Voplex\\" in large letters was visible for quite a distance, and the name stuck. NimbleUser and Synoptek now occupy the building, and the building is part of the three building office complex officially called the Basin Tech Centre on Pittsford-Victor Road. Coincidentally, it is within a quarter mile of the Mushroom House, another notable piece of local architecture, but one not visible from a distance, being located in woods. Another office building, located in Canandaigua, New York, is also a former Voplex location, and is likewise known as the \\"Voplex building\\". However it is of conventional design. Views of the building Southwest side Passing moderately high around a hill, the I-490 highway gives a fine view of the city in the distance with the Voplex building in the near foreground, below the road. From this vantage, one can see the shape of the building as a decagonal, lenticular shape raised up on a much smaller rectangular base. Three segments of the decagon are missing on the south side, forming the main entrance. The building has been likened to a large pie with a section cut out, a flying saucer, the Crunchwrap Supreme, and the Millennium Falcon. It was designed by the architect Carlton DeWolff, founder of the nationally recognized firm of DeWolff Partnership Architects LLP. Other designs in his portfolio include the International Museum of Photography at the George Eastman House, and the Blue Cross Arena in Rochester. Recent history 1995 - The building was acquired by Ray Hutch, founder of Western New York Computing Systems / Synergy Global Solutions. Ray converted the 1st floor covered parking to office space, and added a warehouse on the north side of the building. 2008 - The building was purchased by James Salviski, founder of LogicalSolutions.net and began undergoing a complete renovation (expected to be complete in late 2009). The existing warehouse was converted to a Tier4 data center, and the facility became the new headquarters for LogicalSolutions.net, a software, website design, hosting and Data Center management firm. 2009 - With much of the data center and interior renovation complete, a significant effort to clean up the grounds is underway. People traveling on 490, especially Eastbound travelers, will notice the cleanup of trees and other overgrowth. 2013 - Building is now occupied by EarthLink Business, housing both a data center, a sales team, and support functions. 2015 - NimbleUser, a software development firm, now occupies the second floor, sharing tenancy with EarthLink Business. 2016 - Synoptek acquired EarthLink‚Äôs IT Services business.

The name SPA was based on Studebaker, Pierce and Arrow. SPA manufactured trucks from 1929 to 1933. While the Studebaker industrial fortune had been made by building Conestoga wagons, Studebaker had been late in entering the modern truck market, doing so in 1929. While Studebaker plants were running at near capacity, executives planned on using Pierce-Arrow's unused excess capacity to handle truck production demand. Studebaker attempted to acquire White Motor Company in 1932, a known manufacturer of heavy duty trucks based in Cleveland, Ohio. White backed out of the deal just before March 1933; Studebaker then sold Pierce Arrow to investors, which were forced into bankruptcy and liquidated the firm in 1938. When Studebaker filed for receivership in March 1933, SPA was liquidated and Studebaker focused its attention on automobiles, producing a modest volume of trucks until the late 1930s.

The main thoroughfares are Claremont and Ashby Avenues. The name \\"Claremont\\" was adopted December 20, 1879 at a meeting convened by a real estate developer and local resident, Grant Taggert.Oakland Tribune, December 20, 1879 Within a year or so of this, the name of the main thoroughfare was changed from Telegraph Road to Claremont Avenue. The Telegraph Road had been named for the first telegraph line into Oakland, strung by the Alta Telegraph Company in 1859. The line ran from Martinez across the hills and down what was then named \\"Harwood's Canyon\\" after an early claimant to grazing lands in the canyon above the Claremont neighborhood, retired sea captain and Oakland wharfinger William Harwood. With the advent of the telegraph line, it became \\"Telegraph Canyon\\", a name that persists for a side canyon near the summit of the hills. The creek which runs through the Claremont neighborhood was first known as the north fork of Temescal Creek. It later became Harwood Creek, and eventually, Claremont Creek. During the 19th century, a stage coach line ran up the canyon and over the summit into Contra Costa County. This became an early auto route over the Berkeley Hills even after the first tunnel (the InterCounty Tunnel/Kennedy Tunnel) opened up in 1903 to the south of Claremont Canyon, above where the Caldecott Tunnel is today. In 1905, Duncan McDuffie opened up the Claremont Park development, an upscale tract. In 1909, the portion of the district which now lies within the City of Oakland was annexed to the city. Until then, it had been an unincorporated area of Alameda County. In the early 1900s real estate interests associated with the Key System built the Claremont Hotel at the mouth of Claremont Canyon. The Key System ran one of its commuter train lines directly to the hotel up Claremont Avenue until service ended in 1958. This train became the transbay \\"E\\" train upon completion of the San Francisco‚ÄìOakland Bay Bridge. The principal west-east thoroughfare through the Claremont was at first Russell Street which led directly to the road up Claremont Canyon. With the opening of the first tunnel however, Ashby became the more convenient approach to the Tunnel Road and was improved over the years to channel through traffic, especially during the 1930s when both the new Broadway (later re-named Caldecott) Tunnel and the Bay Bridge were constructed. Ashby and Tunnel Road were then designated State Route 24 and connected to the Eastshore Highway (now Freeway) to serve as an access route to the Bay Bridge and San Francisco. Upon completion of the Grove-Shafter Freeway in the 1960s, it was re-designated State Route 13 and connected to the new Warren Freeway. The Claremont district was one of the areas affected by the 1991 Oakland firestorm. The flames came within a few blocks of the Claremont Hotel, destroying much of the area northeast of Tunnel Road. The area has since been rebuilt.

Vettese is perhaps best known for being the keyboardist for progressive rock band Jethro Tull for most of the 1980s. Early life Peter Vettese grew up in a musical family in Brechin, Angus, Scotland. He began his music studies with piano lessons at the age of 4. At 9, he began playing in public with his father's band. He left home at 17 to join one of the UK's biggest dance hall Big Bands, but was fired for rehearsing in company time with his own group. He then formed the jazz fusion group Solaris with guitarist Jim Condie, and toured Scotland and the US. He was playing in pubs and clubs in Scotland when he saw an advertisement for keyboard players in the music newspaper Melody Maker, which turned out to be from the progressive rock band Jethro Tull. Jethro Tull Vettese joined Jethro Tull in 1982 for the recording of their album The Broadsword and the Beast, and toured with the band extensively for the next couple of years, appearing on the album Live at Hammersmith '84. Vettese made significant contributions to Tull's heavily electronic album Under Wraps, (1984) toured with them again in 1986, and recorded as a guest musician on Rock Island (1989). Vettese also collaborated with Tull's frontman Ian Anderson on Anderson's 1983 solo album, Walk into Light. Vettese co-wrote half the songs on the album, which is notable for his innovative contributions on electronic keyboards. Later career Vettese began an independent career as a songwriter, arranger and producer. In the 1980s he worked with and produced a diverse range of artists including Cutting Crew, Frankie Goes to Hollywood, Go West, Pet Shop Boys, Bee Gees, Cher, Foreigner, Carly Simon and Clannad.

She supposedly took part in the assassinations of Claudius and Britannicus. She was a favourite of emperor Nero for several years, and Nero had her provide training to other poisoners in his service. Following Nero's death, Locusta was executed by his successor, Galba (reigned 68‚Äì69). Primary sources Locusta's career is described by the ancient historians Tacitus (Annals 12.66 and 13.15), Suetonius (Life of Nero, 33 and 47), and Cassius Dio (61.34 and 63.3). Juvenal also mentions Locusta in Book 1, line 71 of his Satires. Biography Locusta was said to come from Gaul.Scholiast on Juvenal 1.71. Poisons expert Locusta served as a poisons expert under empress Agrippina the Younger. According to some historians, in AD 54, already notorious and imprisoned on poisoning charges, Locusta was ordered by the empress Agrippina the Younger to supply a poison for the murder of her husband, Claudius. This was sprinkled on a mushroom and given to the emperor by his food-taster Halotus; when this poison appeared to be ineffectual, the doctor Gaius Stertinius Xenophon murdered Claudius with a poisoned feather ostensibly put down his throat to induce vomiting.Tacitus, Annals 12.66-67; Cassius Dio 61.34. She reportedly advised Agrippina to use Atropa belladonna as a poison. Extracts of atropa have been used for poisoning since antiquity, as the plant and its fruits contain tropane alkaloids (primarily hyoscyamine and scopolamine). Atropa-derived poisons were commonly used in ancient Roman murders, and previous empress Livia reportedly used them to murder her contemporaries. The effective doses of atropa needed to cause hallucinations for up to four days, and the ones needed to kill a person were described by a 1st-century writer, Pedanius Dioscorides. Dioscorides called the plant \\"strychnos manikos\\" or \\"thryon\\". In AD 55, while still imprisoned, Locusta was called upon by Agrippina's son, the emperor Nero, to concoct a poison to murder Claudius' son Britannicus. When this poison was slow to work, Nero flogged Locusta with his own hand and threatened her with immediate execution, whereupon she supplied a quicker-acting poison that succeeded. Nero rewarded Locusta with a full pardon and large country estates where he sent pupils to learn her craft.Suetonius, Nero 33; Tacitus, Annals 13.15. Before Nero fled Rome in AD 68, he acquired poison from Locusta for his own use and kept it in a golden box. He eventually died by other means. Suetonius, Nero 47. Execution After Nero's suicide, Locusta was condemned to die by the emperor Galba during his brief reign, which ended 15 January AD 69. Along with Nero's favorites Helius, Patrobius, Narcissus and \\"others of the scum that had come to the surface in Nero's day\\", she was led in chains through the city and executed.Cassius Dio 64.3 Legacy Juvenal refers to her in one of his Satires, describing a poisoner as even more skilled than Locusta.Juvenal, Satires 1.71. In the novel The Count of Monte Cristo (1844) by Alexandre Dumas, the poisoner Madame de Villefort is frequently compared to Locusta. Chapter 101 is entitled \\"Locusta\\".Dumas, Alexandre. The Count of Monte Cristo. Oxford, GBR: Oxford University Press, UK, 2008. ProQuest ebrary. Web. 10 November 2015. Locusta was one of the characters depicted in the historical film Humanity Through the Ages (1908) by director Georges M√©li√®s. The film was an episodic depiction of humanity's brutality throughout its history, and the historic episodes depicted were chosen because they involved fratricide, murders, religious persecution, physical abuse and public humiliation, prisons and executions of prisoners, torture, and violent criminal subcultures. The film is thought to be among the lost films from its era. Locusta appears as a character in the 1965 Doctor Who story The Romans, played by Ann Tirard. Described as the 'official poisoner to the court of Caesar Nero', she is portrayed as comically untroubled by the macabre nature of the service she provides.

He is notable for creating the 12-points-per-inch pica typographical standard [1]. This system was first used by typographers to make the standard-sized letter-blocks used by printers, and now by font designers to make the digital fonts on computers. He held that there should be a standard measurement system for printing, and promoted the idea. Throughout Hawks' childhood he aspired to become a printer and by the age of 16 he had found employment as a printer's devil (colloquial; apprentice). By the age of 18 had started his own newspaper. In 1874 Hawks moved to San Francisco where he established the Pacific Type Foundry in partnership with Marder, Luse, & Co., type founders of Chicago. In the late 1870s, while head of the Pacific Type Foundry, he developed his point system based on seventy-two points to an inch. He first proposed the system to John Marder when Marder visited California in 1877. Although, like most type founders, Marder was reluctant to accept it, he was convinced by Hawk's persistence. Official announcement from Marder, Luse and Company came in 1879 after it had several new type faces available using the new point system [2]. Hawks refused to patent the system, insisting that it be a \\"free gift for the benefit of the trade.\\" After resigning from his partnership with Marder, Luse and Company in 1882, he worked tirelessly to advance the point system and have it adopted by other type foundries. By 1902 not only had most foundries in the United States adopted the system, but the British Associated Type Founders had begun using it. During the 1860s and after there were at least 30 type foundries in America producing hand set type (before the advent of automation or keyboards), and each one had their own way to measure. It was through the persistent efforts of Nelson Hawks that the many foundries in the United States were convinced that the point system should be adopted. After his system became universal in the United States and the United Kingdom, revolutionizing the manufacture of printing type, he was honored by the American Type Founders Association at an event in New York City in 1892 where it was claimed that Hawks' system, \\"...marks a New Era in the History of Typography, and is the most important improvement in type making since the days Gutenberg[3].\\" He lived to see his system become the standard of the English-speaking world. At 80 years old he commented in regards to life: \\"The only benefit I have derived from it lies in the satisfaction of having been successful in giving the printing craft something useful and lasting.\\" He died on July 2, 1929, at age 89. Another point system, invented in 1734 by Pierre Simon Fournier of France, was the first point system to be proposed. However it was not widely known. Hawks was not aware of Fournier's work when he developed his own point system, which is the one used today. There is however a strong connection between the Fournier-system and the American Pica.Thomas, History of Printing in America, vol 1, p.20, second editionRich L. Hopkins, The origin of the American Point System, page 64-65, Hale & Dale Private Press, Terra Alta, West Virginia, 1976, 2nd edition 1989 Benjamin Franklin bought from Fournier \\"matrices of an old foundry\\". Franklin had his grandson B. F. Bache instructed in the art by Fournier with the intent to establish an extensive foundry in Philadelphia. This foundry was no success, it was neglected and Bache abandoned it. After the Franklin died, the typefoundry tools came in possession of his relative Duane, who lend all meterials to Binny & Ronaldson at that present the only foundry of importance in Philadelphia. Ronaldsson was impressed with the superiority of these tools, as was Binny. They made use of the Fourney mould for their pica. This standard was accepted by their successors L. Johnson & Co and the MacKellar, Smiths & Jordan Co. The slight deviation from the size of the Fournier-mould (4 points in one thousand) can be explained by the long-term use of the moulds in those days.

It runs from its junction with Piccadilly and Mosley Street, close to Piccadilly Gardens, in the east to where it meets St. Mary's Gate at the crossroads with Exchange Street and New Cathedral Street in the west. St Mary's Gate then continues to where it meets Deansgate (A56). Other major streets crossed are High Street, Corporation Street (on the north side), Cross Street and Fountain Street (on the south side).  History  Market Street in Manchester, once known as Market Stead Lane, lies along the former route of the A6 road which goes from Luton, Bedfordshire, to Carlisle, Cumbria. The A6 arrives at Manchester city centre as London Road and formerly went north-west along Piccadilly, Market Street, St. Mary's Gate and Blackfriars Street and then over the River Irwell to Blackfriars Street, Salford. But since the pedestrianisation of Market Street the A6 disappears at the junction of Piccadilly and Oldham Street to reemerge in Salford as Chapel Street. Some of modern Market Street is a pedestrian zone with motor vehicle access limited to the emergency services, maintenance workers and deliveries to the adjacent shops. The pedestrianisation is broken by High Street, which is open to general traffic, and the south-eastern end of the street is open to trams at the Metrolink tram stop. Layout and shops Starting in the east at Piccadilly/Mosley Street, the street shares its space equally between pedestrian walkways and two Metrolink tram lines. Standing on opposite sides of the tram lines loom the imposing edifices of two large department stores belonging to Debenhams (formerly Ryland's and Paulden's) to the north and Primark (formerly Lewis's department store, 1877‚Äì2001) to the south. Moving west, the street crosses Fountain Street and High Street where the tram lines turn away towards the north. With the removal of the tram lines, Market Street becomes an entirely pedestrian zone bustling with shoppers. Dominating the entire north side of this section is the Manchester Arndale Centre, an indoor shopping complex. A large variety of shops of various sizes line the south side of the street. Throughout the pedestrian zone there can often be found a large number of street traders and entertainers. Such entertainers have in the past included traditional buskers, bagpipes players and even string quartets. Reaching the end of the Arndale Centre, the street crosses Corporation Street and Cross Street, ceasing to be a pedestrian zone and continues on to end where it meets St. Mary's Gate at the crossroads with Exchange Street and New Cathedral Street. This western section of Market Street is lined with the Marks & Spencer department store on its north side and another series of smaller shops to the south. At its western end, Market Street meets St Mary's Gate, which then continues on to meet Deansgate (A56) a former Roman road. George Sampson, the 2008 winner of Britain's Got Talent, honed many of his street dancing skills on Market Street.

James P. Fox was the first person elected to the assembly under a new system under Prime Minister Sir William Whiteway legislation extending the right to vote in elections for the House of Assembly to all males 21 years of age and older. Family Fox had married Isabelle Langrishe LeGallais, a great-granddaughter of Dr. William Carson on September 21, 1882. One of Isabelle and James' six children, John (Jack) Fox, was Newfoundland‚Äôs Rhodes Scholar for 1911 and served with distinction in the Newfoundland Regiment in the First World War. Career Fox became a partner in his father‚Äôs firm, James Fox and Sons, in 1882. Fox Senior had been a member of the Legislative Council, the upper house in the bicameral system of government under which Newfoundland operated in the period between 1855 and 1934. Such as it was, Fox was exposed at an early age and it was something in which he developed a keen interest. In 1888, he became a member of the first St. John‚Äôs municipal council. Consisted of seven members: five members elected on a ward system and two members appointed by the Newfoundland Government, Fox, along with James Goodfellow, who was the first chair of the council, was one of the government appointees.Encyclopedia of Newfoundland and Labrador, Volume Two, (p. 360) At 30 years old, Fox left municipal council in 1890 when he was appointed to the Legislative Council by Prime Minister Sir William Whiteway. He then resigned Legislative Council to run in a by-election to fill a seat after Dr. John Dearin had died suddenly. Fox won the seat making him the first person elected to the House of Assembly under the new Manhood Suffrage Act of 1890. He was again reelected in St. John‚Äôs East in the general election of November 6, 1893. Fox was named as Receiver General, the chief financial officer in the administration. On January 6, 1894, the Conservatives filed petitions under the Corrupt Practices Act charging 15 Liberals and Independent MHA James Murray with bribery and corruption. Fox was one of those charged. On May 5, the court found Fox guilty as charged. His seat was declared vacant along with James Murphy and they were disqualified from running for election to the House of Assembly in future elections. Fox's brother, John F. Fox, ran for the Liberals in the Nov. 10 by-election and won the seat. Newfoundland hockey pioneer James Fox was one of the pioneers of organized hockey in Newfoundland as a member of the first St. John's Hockey Club in the fall of 1895. He also participated in what is regarded as Newfoundland's earliest recorded hockey game in February 1896 on Quidi Vidi lake in the capital city of St. John's.Icing the Puck: The Origins, Rise and Decline of Newfoundland Senior Hockey 1896-1996 by Gregory B White (1997,p.36) In 1897 Fox was the first president of the St. John's Hockey Association that subsequently became the Newfoundland Hockey Association, the predecessor of the Newfoundland Amateur Hockey Association in 1935.

The UpdatePanel Control The UpdatePanel is an ASP.NET server control that updates portions of a web page without reloading it. Through a mechanism called asynchronous postback, the HTML for the region of the page wrapped by the control is sent by the server asynchronously through an Ajax request. The ASP.NET controls that have been specified as content in an UpdatePanel are able to cause either synchronous (traditional) or asynchronous postbacks, by means of triggers. A trigger is an event coming from an ASP.NET control that causes an UpdatePanel to refresh its contents. Through triggers, an asynchronous postback can be started also by controls that are declared outside the region of the ASP.NET page wrapped by the UpdatePanel control. In the following code, only the content of the Update control (the span element that displays the current date and time) is re-rendered every time the button is clicked. <%= DateTime.Now %> Web-services and JSON ASP.NET AJAX framework brings JSONserialization features to the ASP.NET web-services and allows calling web-services from client-side JavaScript, even using third- party JavaScript-libraries like jQuery.

The player can only watch the game, and make decisions on how his team plays. Reception At the time of release, Graham Gooch's Test Cricket was considered the most accurate cricket game out by reviewers. It received high scores for gameplay and graphics but lower scores for the sound, which is because it consisted of basic and few sound effects. Spectrum magazine CRASH rated the game 65% and commented that it is the \\"best cricket simulation yet on the spectrum\\". Graham Gooch's Test Cricket was rated poorly by Your Sinclair magazine, scoring just three out of ten. The magazine's main complaints were with the gameplay, such as not being able to change the fielding settings and unrealistic run rates.

It served as the home of commercial aviation in Albuquerque from 1928 to 1929 and remained in use for other purposes until 1948. The field was located on Albuquerque's East Mesa, east of the present site of Albuquerque International Sunport. History The field was originally constructed in 1928 by Santa Fe Railroad workers Frank G. Speakman and William Langford Franklin, using grading equipment loaned by the city after hours. Working with the town of Albuquerque, they graded two runways on the East Mesa‚Äîone approximately long and the other just under . The venture became Albuquerque Airport. Other individuals and promoters soon became interested in Albuquerque as a crossroads location for southwestern air traffic. James G. Oxnard, a New York entrepreneur, bought out Franklin's share in the airport soon after it was completed and renamed it Oxnard Field.U.S. Air Force, Fact Sheet, Kirtland Air Force Base History, , retrieved April 4, 2008 Oxnard expanded the facility to , adding an administration building and other facilities. In its brief stint as the city's main airport, Oxnard Field was served by two competing airlines, Western Air Express (WAE) and Transcontinental Air Transport (TAT). However, the proximity of the field to the Sandia Mountains made pilots uneasy, and Western Air Express built a new facility, West Mesa Airport, in 1929. Following the merger of TAT and WAE to form Transcontinental and Western Air (TWA), all commercial air service shifted to West Mesa. This airport became known as Albuquerque Airport‚Äîwhile the former Albuquerque Airport on the East Mesa took on the name Oxnard Field, continuing as a private venture. The onset of World War II brought new activity to Oxnard Field. By 1939, Army and Navy pilots had begun using Oxnard Field for refuelling and maintenance. The Army eventually bought the Oxnard Field property and its subsequent transfer to the federal government on April 3, 1942 restricted the runways to military use only. The Army established a training depot for aircraft mechanics near Oxnard Field. An Army Air Forces Air Depot Training Station was established in June, and shortly thereafter the airport was designated Albuquerque Army Air Field. Two new runways and a variety of other facilities were built during this period. By 1943, however, the mechanics' training program had ended and the depot was used as a convalescent center for wounded air crewmen and then as a storage and dismantling facility for war-weary and surplus aircraft as the war ended. Over 2,000 such planes were stripped and melted down, reclaiming some 10 million pounds of aluminum.Kirtland AFB Fact Sheet The field was used for the last time between 1945 and 1948, when it served as the final destination for hundreds of surplus warplanes which were assembled there for scrapping. Following the end of this operation, the airport was closed permanently. Facilities The airport initially had two dirt runways, east-west (4300 ft) and northeast-southwest (2500 ft). The only facilities consisted of gravity- fed fuel tanks. Oxnard added the administration building, a hangar, and a beacon. The Airport Inn was a popular dining establishment. The airport reached its final configuration during the war, when the north-south and northwest-southeast runways were added. Oxnard Field today The former airport is now part of Kirtland Air Force Base, and new development has covered most of it. However, part of the northeast-southwest runway remains visible and the former administration building and hangar are still standing. Another legacy of Oxnard Field is the major streets Wyoming Boulevard and Ridgecrest Drive, both of which were originally developed as airport access roads. References Notes #Oppenheimer, Alan J.

Marie-Catherine de Villedieu, born Marie- Catherine Desjardins and generally referred to as Madame de Villedieu (1640 ‚Äì 20 October 1683) was a French writer of plays, novels and short fiction. Largely forgotten or eclipsed by other writers of the period (such as Madame de La Fayette) in the works of literary historians of the 19th and 20th centuries, Madame de Villedieu is currently enjoying a literary revival. Biography Madame de Villedieu was born at Alen√ßon, the second daughter of Guillaume Desjardins and Catherine Ferrand, who worked as a ladies' maid for the wife of duke Henri de Rohan-Montbazon. After the divorce of her parents in 1655 the fifteen-year-old girl was taken by her mother to Paris.Donna Kuizenga, DLB 268, p. 385. She came under the protection of the duchess of Rohan (thanks to the poems she presented her). Louis XIV gave Madame de Villedieu a pension of 1500 livres. She was admitted to the Academy of the Ricovrati of Padua. She died at Saint-R√©my-du-Val (Sarthe). Madame de Villedieu was prolific in the genre of \\"nouvelles historiques\\" and \\"nouvelles galantes\\" which began to appear in France in the 1660s. An interest in love, psychological analysis, moral dilemmas and social constraints permeated these relatively short novels. When the action was placed in an historical setting, this was increasingly a setting in the recent past, and although still filled with anachronisms, these novels showed an interest in historical detail; these are generally called \\"nouvelles historiques\\". A number of these short novels recounted the \\"secret history\\" of a famous event, linking the action generally to an amorous intrigue; these were called \\"histoires galantes\\". Les D√©sordres de l‚ÄôAmour is perhaps Madame de Villedieu's most well-known work in this genre. Her masterpiece is perhaps the pseudo-memoir novel M√©moires de la vie d'Henriette-Sylvie de Moli√®re, a remarkably realistic story (in the vein of a picaresque novel) recounting the economic and emotional misfortunes of a young woman in contemporary French society. Along with her novels, she wrote three plays: the tragicomedy Manlius performed with critical success by the actors of the H√¥tel de Bourgogne in 1662 (the play engendered a debate between Jean Donneau de Vis√© and Fran√ßois H√©delin, abb√© d'Aubignac concerning its historical accuracy); the tragedy Nit√©tis performed April 27, 1663; and the tragicomedy Le Favori, performed April 24, 1665 at Th√©√¢tre du Palais-Royal in Paris and June 13, 1665 at Versailles. She died at her manor in Clinchemore in 1683.

It is a theory for how people interact with the world, and has been applied in both ethics and general philosophy. There are several forms of projectivism. David Hume describes projectivism: Projectivism in ethics and meta-ethics The origins of projectivism lie with Hume. He describes the view in Treatise on Human Nature. More recently, Simon Blackburn has been a major proponent of the view. Blackburn's projectivism is a version of meta-ethical anti-realism. Blackburn conveys anti-realism as the view that statements which express moral properties are our construction, and realism as the view that moral properties somehow exist independent of us, the moral agents. A further distinction should be made to understand Blackburn's projectivism: that between cognitivists and non-cognitivists. Cognitivists believe that moral claims are \\"truth-apt\\", that is capable of being true or false. Non-cognitivists, on the other hand, believe that moral claims are not truth-apt‚Äînot capable of being true or false. As a non-cognitivist, the projectivist holds that ethical judgments are the product of conative, rather than cognitive psychological processes. A conative psychological process or state is something akin to a stance, attitude, or disposition. These conative psychological processes should be contrasted with cognitive ones, which are what we typically think of when we talk about human beings ‚Äúusing their reason‚Äù or perhaps being rational (at least in the narrow sense). As highly social creatures whose success as a species has been due for the most part to our ability to communicate and cooperate, projectivism holds that the development of a moral interest has actually been in our prudential interest. Blackburn‚Äôs projectivism, what he calls quasi-realism, is based on the significance of the conative stances we hold. His idea is that these conative stances are the starting point for what the meta-ethical realist labels beliefs or even facts, like that you ought to feed your children, or that you have moral values‚Äîreal values that exist out there in the world independent of you. Since these conative stances are essentially motivating, they can be called desires, and the realist may be tempted to see them as desires connected to true beliefs about things that exist independent of mental construction. This temptation is not in any way ridiculous because as we grow and develop, our conative stances can become quite refined into a kind of moral sensibility. So for the projectivist, meta- ethical realists confuse moral sense and sensibility, as it were. The projectivist position holds that our moral sensibility can become very sophisticated as we age and mature. As we experience compassion, we come to value compassion; or with gratitude, we come to admire being gracious, and consider gratitude a virtue. But the projectivist is not committed to saying that our response to something wrong (i.e. sense) is what determines its rightness or wrongness. The view is that the wrong-making features of actions are external, and they play a role in the development of essentially motivating moral sentiments that guide conduct. The view is vulnerable to a big worry for the ethical realist: projectivism may collapse into subjectivism or some variety of moral relativism. For example, it may seem that if Hitler truly felt the Holocaust was the right thing to do, the only possible projectivist response would to be that if Hitler truly thought he was doing the right thing, we might say he was wrong, but for him, it was right. But here, projectivism does not collapse into subjectivism. Where a subjectivist sees no moral disagreement (because he believes ‚ÄúX is right‚Äù just means ‚ÄúI approve of X‚Äù), the projectivist can allow for moral disagreement. A bigger vulnerability for the view is that it lacks explanatory power. The worry is that projectivism does not explain meta-ethics, it explains it away. Projectivism may stand to meta-ethics as particularism stands to ethics. Hume's projectivist theory of causation Suppose for example that somebody is hit by a hammer, and sometime later a bruise appears at the point of impact. The impact of the hammer is an observable event; the bruise too is observable. The causal connection between the two events, however, is not observed or experienced, at least according to Hume. Hume believed that whenever we can claim to know something about the world, that knowledge must be derived from experience (see Hume's fork). We do not experience the causal connection between a hammer impact and the formation of a bruise. All we observe are distinct events, occurring at the same place and time (Constant conjunction). Because we observe events of this type, we are led by induction to suppose that like causes will result in like effects, and from this we have the notion of causation. This does not mean Hume doubted that one material object was able to cause a change or movement in another material object. It means that insofar as we talk about some cause resulting in some effect, it is not something we have learned of the world we are talking about because it is not derived from experience. Rather, we are talking about a feature of our thinking which we are inclined to discuss as if it were a feature of the world. In short: when we believe we have observed a causal connection all we have really experienced is a conjunction between two separate events. We can only know about the world through experience, so causation as a feature of the world is something unknowable to a human being. The projectivist theory of probability What does it mean to say that the probability that a coin lands heads is ¬Ω? One might think that the coin will either land upward or it will not, the probability is not a feature of the world, but rather just a measure of our own ignorance. Frank Ramsey (see his collected papers, edited by D. H. Mellor) and Bruno de Finetti, developed projectivist theories of probability in the early twentieth century. To explain their theories, the concept of degree of belief must first be introduced. Let us say that a person has a degree of belief of 1 in a particular proposition if he is completely convinced of its truth. For example, most people have a degree of belief of 1 in the proposition that 2+2=4. On the other hand, a person has a degree of belief 0 in a proposition if he is utterly convinced of its falsity; most people have a degree of belief of zero in the proposition that 2+2=5. Intermediate values are possible. A man who thinks that his dog has stolen the sausages, but is not completely sure, might have a degree of belief of 0.8 in the proposition that his dog stole the sausages. For each person A, we can define a (partial) function CA mapping the set of propositions to the closed interval [0, 1] by stipulating that for a proposition P CA(P)=t if and only if C has a degree of belief t in the proposition P. Ramsey and de Finetti independently attempted to show that if A is rational, CA is a probability function: that is, CA satisfies the standard (Kolmogorov) probability axioms. They supposed that when I describe an event as having probability P I am really voicing my degrees of belief. Probabilities are not real features of the world. For example, when I say that the event that the coin lands heads up has probability ¬Ω, I do so because my degree of belief in the proposition that the coin will land heads up is ¬Ω. A counter-argument would be that: ‚ÄúThis needs to be restated to show probability in a particular number of flips, not one coin flip, which DOES only have a probability of 1/2 since it only has two sides‚Äù. This argument is moot, as the probability of the coin either landing on a heads or tails is 1, however, the observer is unable to accurately measure the input variables contributing to the output condition. Thus, in the projectivist view, probability is a measure of the degree to which an observer believes in a given proposition of the outcome of an event.

He was played by George Lindsey. Lindsey first read for the part of Gomer Pyle, Goober's cousin, which went to actor-singer Jim Nabors. The two actors had similar backgrounds; Lindsey was from Jasper, Alabama, while Nabors was from Sylacauga, Alabama. The character was introduced by Andy Taylor (played by Andy Griffith) as Goober Beasley,season 5 episode 23 TV or Not TV but he was referred to as Goober Pyle for most of his time on the show. Character The cousin of Gomer Pyle, Goober was initially often referred to by Gomer but never seen until his appearance in the episode \\"Fun Girls,\\" which was the only Andy Griffith Show episode in which the two appeared together. Goober later appeared in an episode of Gomer Pyle, USMC. Both Pyle cousins worked at Wally's Filling Station, though not together, and were the show's comic relief. Lindsey was hired to fill the void when Gomer was spun off to join the United States Marine Corps. During season five, Goober was initially referred to as \\"Goober Beasley.\\" To solidify the connection to Gomer, Goober's surname was changed to \\"Pyle.\\" While Gomer always referenced Grandma Pyle, Goober never mentioned her. Goober Pyle visits Aunt Bee's Chinese restaurant in his formal attire Goober was viewed as backward and not very bright. Although Goober portrayed a somewhat childlike and happy-go-lucky character, he had the ability to view life and people with a sense of wonder and goodness. And his automotive mechanical skills were exceptional, as evidenced in one episode by taking Gilly Walker's car apart and reassembling it inside the sheriff's office, and then taking it apart again and reassembling it again outside. Goober was similar to his cousin Gomer, though less animated. Both cousins shared a love for high-stepping, swing dancing, even when the music was far less dynamic. Goober's older brother Braden was a noted rocket-scientist for NASA, and once visited Mayberry RFD on the 1969 episode, \\"Goober's Brother.\\" Howard Sprague attributed the vast intellectual disparity between the brothers to Mendel's theory of recessive genes. Goober's attire Goober was distinctively attired for the show. He was generally dressed in a work shirt, breast pocket filled with pencils, pens, and tire gauges. His dark blue Dickies work pants were hoisted high and cinched with a wide belt, giving him an Empire waistline. Work boots and a customized beanie hat or whoopee cap (similar to that of the comic character Jughead Jones) completed his episode- to-episode wardrobe. Very occasionally, Goober would dress up for the rare formal occasion in a suit described as \\"an unsophisticated double-vested, brown pinstripe number with white socks\\" that was passed to him from his cousin Gomer. A garish tie completed the picture of the dressed-up Goober. Goober's suit was originally owned by Howard McNear (Floyd) who donated it for a friend's funeral. It was rejected and returned to the studio where it wound up in wardrobe. On two occasions, Goober also wore one of Andy's suits, which was first lent to him in Raleigh at the auto show when his suit ripped. He borrowed it again one other time. On August 27, 2010, the suit became part of the Andy Griffith Museum in Mount Airy, North Carolina. George Lindsey, who was 81 going on 82 that December, and rarely traveled, asked Jim Clark to appear in his place, telling the crowd, \\"He told me to say Goober says, 'Hey!'\\" Clark said Lindsey wore the suit while playing Goober on many Andy Griffith Show/ \\"RFD\\" episodes as well as on Hee Haw. Character biography Goober was born in either 1940 or 1941 (he says he was five years old when he was a witness to Floyd punching Charles Foley on August 9, 1946 in the episode entitled \\"The Case of the Punch in the Nose\\"). He was raised in Mayberry, was trained as a mechanic in Raleigh, North Carolina, and served a stint in the North Carolina National Guard where he picked up the phrase, \\"Yo.\\" Goober worked at Wally's Filling Station, which he eventually purchased and became the proprietor of, later in the show's run. His girlfriend in four of the color episodes was Flora Malherbe, but his initial love interest was Lydia Crosswaith, who was originally from Greensboro, North Carolina. Goober is known for his (bad) impressions of celebrities. He impersonates Cary Grant (\\"Judy, Judy, Judy!\\") and Edward G. Robinson (\\"OK, you guys. Come on, you guys. All right, you guys. Beat it, you guys.\\"). He could also impersonate Chester Goode's walk from Gunsmoke and perform lame schtick such as simulating sewing up his fingers. The only people who were truly impressed by his talents were his cousin Gomer and the fun girls, Daphne and Skippy. He had a penchant for Super-Hero and monster comic books and sci-fi movies. Each Pyle cousin had his own peculiar dance moves. Goober is made an emergency deputy several times when minor crime waves erupted in Mayberry. Goober is an old friend of Andy Sawyer, a native of the much larger town of Greenwood who happens to look exactly like Sheriff Andy Taylor and behave similarly to him as well; Goober visits Sawyer in Greenwood during the premiere episode of The New Andy Griffith Show. Goober appeared on 86 episodes of The Andy Griffith Show from 1964 through 1968, one episode each of Gomer Pyle U.S.M.C. and The New Andy Griffith Show and then on 54 episodes of Mayberry R.F.D. until its cancellation in 1971. Following that, Lindsey spent roughly 20 years playing the character on Hee Haw from 1972 through 1992. Goober also appeared in the 1978 television movie Goober & the Truckers Paradise and the 1986 television reunion movie Return to Mayberry alongside his cousin Gomer for only the third time in television history (running the town's G'nG gas station and auto repair shop). The characters also appeared together in one TAGS episode and one Gomer Pyle USMC episode.

The specific name refers to the provenance near Luonang.Xue, X., Zhang, Y., Bi, Y., Yue, L., and Chen, D., 1996, [The Development and Environmental Changes of the Intermontane Basins in the Eastern Part of Qinling Mountains], Geological Publishing House, Beijing, 181 pp The holotype, NWUV 1112, was found in a layer of the Hongtuling Formation or Shanyang Formation, perhaps dating from the Maastrichtian. It consists of an ilium, ischium and three vertebrae. The ilium has a length of seventy-seven centimetres and is elongated with a convex upper profile. Its anterior process is relatively long. The pubic process is long, the ischial process short. In view of the limited fossil evidence, it is classified as Sauropoda incertae sedis. It probably represents a member of the Neosauropoda.

The film was shot on location in Dallas and Fort Worth, Texas. It was released on DVD in the US on December 25, 2007. Living & Dying tells the story of two killers who turn the tables on a group of bank robbers after a botched heist. Plot summary Four people rob the vault of a bank at gunpoint. The only trouble is that a large armed police presence turns up as they try to drive away. They take shelter in a diner, where two psychos with guns, Max and Karl decide to take over, and have the (about) $500,000 for themselves. The robbers become victims with the owners of the diner and the people who were eating there. At first Max and Karl let Sam, one of the robbers do all the talking to Det. Devlin, not letting on that they are there also. But then they decide to make demands as telephone negotiations are going nowhere and shoot one of the hostages in front of the police. Lind, another negotiator has turned up and takes over, with a gung-ho attitude. Devlin has been looking at the bank tapes and see that some of the money the robbers took was not supposed to be there. The bank manager confesses it was payment for an (illegal) arms deal. A phone call shows Lind to be fake and he is shot while shooting his accomplice. A TV reporter is allowed in with a camera to film what they allow, but Max sees her hidden camera which is showing the police what is really going on there and for that she is brutally raped and dumped in a store room. A hidden phone reveals to the hostages that one of the robbers was an undercover cop (who has been shot dead) who would have a second gun, which a young woman manages to get and hand to Sam. There is a shoot out and dozens of bullets from each gun, with few hits. The cops rush in and the siege is over, but there is still a surprise ending. Cast *Edward Furlong ....

In most cultures snakes were symbolic and symbols of healing and transformation, but in some cultures snakes were fertility symbols, for example the Hopi people of North America performed an annual snake dance to celebrate the union of Snake Youth (a Sky spirit) and Snake Girl (an Underworld spirit) and to renew fertility of Nature. During the dance, live snakes were handled and at the end of the dance the snakes were released into the fields to guarantee good crops. \\"The snake dance is a prayer to the spirits of the clouds, the thunder and the lightning, that the rain may fall on the growing crops..\\" In other cultures snakes symbolised the umbilical cord, joining all humans to Mother Earth. The Great Goddess often had snakes as her familiars‚Äîsometimes twining around her sacred staff, as in ancient Crete‚Äîand they were worshipped as guardians of her mysteries of birth and regeneration. Immortality Some cultures regarded snakes as immortal because they appeared to be reincarnated from themselves when they sloughed their skins. Snakes were often also associated with immortality because they were observed biting their tails to form a circle and when they coiled they formed spirals. Both circles and spirals were seen as symbols of eternity. The circle was particularly important to Dahomeyan myth where the snake-god Danh circled the world like a belt, corsetting it and preventing it from flying apart in splinters. In Egyptian myth, the state of existence before creation was symbolised as Amduat, a many-coiled serpent from which Ra the Sun and all of creation arose, returning each night and being reborn every morning. Also, the snake biting its tail (Ouroboros) symbolised the sea as the eternal ring which enclosed the world. In Egypt the snake has healing abilities. Hymns and offerings were made to it since it was believed that the Goddess could manifest through the snake. \\"In a hymn to the goddess Mertseger, a workman on the Necropolis of Thebes relates how the goddess came to him in the form of a snake to heal his illness (Bunn1967:617). In Serer cosmogony and religion, the serpent is the symbol of the pangool, the saints and ancestral spirits of the Serer people of West Africa. When a person dies, the Serer believe that their soul must make its way to Jaaniiw (a place where goods souls go). Before the soul can reach Jaaniiw in order to reincarnate (cii…ó in SererFaye, Louis Di√®ne, Mort et Naissance le monde Sereer, Les Nouvelles Editions Africaines (1983) pp. 9‚Äî10. ), it must transform into a black snake. During this transformation, the snake hides in a tree. For this reason, it is taboo in Serer culture to kill snakes. A great degree of respect is afforded to snakes in Serer culture, as they are the very embodiment and symbol of their saints and ancestral spirits.Kalis, Simone, M√©decine traditionnelle, religion et divination ches les Seereer Siin du S√©n√©gal ‚Äì La connaissance de la nuit, L‚ÄôHarmattan (1997), pp. 48, 291, 293, 329, Gravrand, Henry, La civilisation sereer, \\"Cosaan: les origines\\", vol.1, Nouvelles Editions africaines (1983), p 33, Faye, Louis Di√®ne, Mort et Naissance le monde Sereer, Les Nouvelles Editions Africaines (1983) pp. 17‚Äî25.

The serpent plays an active role in Dogon religion and cosmogony. The mythology of the Dogon's primordial ancestor Lebe, it based almost entirely on a serpent mythology. In their traditional African religious belief, they say that the Serpent Lebe guided the Dogon people from Mand√© to the Bandiagara Escarpment (their current home) when they decided to migrate to flee Islamization and persecution. The Dogon believe that Lebe is the very reincarnation of the Dogon's first ancestor‚Äîwho was resurrected in the form of a snake.Heusch, Luc de, Sacrifice in Africa: A Structuralist Approach, (trans. Linda O'Brien, Alice Morton), Manchester University Press (1985), p. 132, (retrieved March 3, 2020) Imperato, Pascal James, Dogon Cliff Dwellers: The Art of Mali's Mountain People, L. Kahan Gallery/African Arts (1978), pp. 15, 23 In the Sumerian culture snakes were also very important as a healing symbol. In Hammurabi‚Äôs Law Code (c. 1700 BC) the god Ninazu is identified as the patron of healing, and his son, Ningishzida, is depicted with a serpent and staff symbol (Bunn 1967:618) Creation myths Snakes were a common feature of many creation myths, for example many people in california and Australia had myths about the Rainbow Snake, which was either Mother Earth herself giving birth to all animals or a water-god whose writhings created rivers, creeks and oceans. In ancient Indian myth, the drought-serpent Ahi or Vritra swallowed the primordial ocean and did not release all created beings until Indra split the serpent's stomach with a thunderbolt. In another myth, the protector Vishnu slept on the coils of the world-serpent Shesha (or \\"Ananta the endless\\";). Shesha in turn was supported on Kurma and when Kurma moved, Shesha stirred and yawned and the gaping of its jaws caused earthquakes. In Chinese mythology, the woman-headed snake N√ºwa made the first humans. She made humans one at a time with clay. To conserve her energy, she dipped a rope in clay and flicked it so blobs of clay landed everywhere; each blob of clay became an individual human. The first humans of hers became high- class, but second ones became low-class. Greek cosmological myths tell of how Ophion the snake incubated the primordial egg from which all created things were born. The classical symbol of the Ouroboros depicts a snake in the act of eating its own tail. This symbol has many interpretations, one of which is the snake representing cyclical nature of life and death, life feeding on itself in the act of creation. The underworld Snakes were regularly regarded as guardians of the Underworld or messengers between the Upper and Lower worlds because they lived in cracks and holes in the ground. The Gorgons of Greek myth were snake-women (a common hybrid) whose gaze would turn flesh into stone, the most famous of them being Medusa. Nagas, \\"the demon cobra\\" and naginis were human-headed snakes whose kings and queens who lived in jewel- encrusted underground or underwater paradises and who were perpetually at war with Garuda the Sun-bird. In Egyptian myth, every morning the serpent Aapep (symbolising chaos) attacked the Sunship (symbolising order). Aapep would try to engulf the ship and the sky was drenched red at dawn and dusk with its blood as the Sun defeated it. In Nordic myth, evil was symbolised by the serpent (actually a dragon) Nidhogg (the 'Dread Biter') who coiled around one of the three roots of Yggdrasil the Tree of Life, and tried to choke or gnaw the life from it. \\"Here there is an evil dragon named Nidhogg that gnaws constantly at the root, striving to destroy Yggdrasil\\" In ancient Slavic paganism a deity by the name of Veles presided over the underworld. He is almost always portrayed as a serpent or dragon depending on the particular myth. The underworld was part of a mythical world tree. The roots of this tree (usually growing in water) were guarded by Veles (Volos) the serpent god. The idea of snake-people living below the Earth was prominent in American myth. The Aztec underworld, Mictlan was protected by python-trees, a gigantic alligator and a snake, all of which spirits had to evade by physical ducking and weaving or cunning, before they could start the journey towards immortality. In North America, the Brule Sioux people told of three brothers transformed into rattlesnakes which permanently helped and guided their human relatives. The Pomo people told of a woman who married a rattlesnake-prince and gave birth to four snake-children who freely moved between the two worlds of their parents. The Hopi people told of a young man who ventured into the underworld and married a snake-princess. Amongst the Navajo people is a tale of Glispa, a girl returned with magical healing lore after spending two years with the Snake People by the Lake of Emergence in the underworld. Water Snakes were also commonly associated with water especially myths about the primordial ocean being formed of a huge coiled snake as in Ahi/Vritra in early Indian myth and Jormungand in Nordic myth. Sea monsters lived in every ocean from the seven-headed crocodile-serpent Leviathan of Hebrew myth to the sea- god Koloowisi of the Zuni people of North America and the Greek monster Scylla with twelve snake-necks. In some cultures, eels (which spend their early lives in freshwater before returning to the sea as adults) were regarded as magical creatures. Rivers and lakes often had snake-gods or snake-guardians including Untekhi the fearsome water-spirit of the Missouri River. Until recently, some northern European communities held well dressing ceremonies to appease the snake-spirits which lived in village wells and told legends of saints defeating malevolent lake-snakes e.g. Saint George killing a maiden-devouring serpent or Saint Columba lecturing the Loch Ness Monster which then stopped eating humans and became shy of human visitors. Carved stones depicting a seven-headed cobra are commonly found near the sluices of the ancient irrigation tanks in Sri Lanka; these are believed to have been placed as guardians of the water. Wisdom Snakes were associated with wisdom in many mythologies, perhaps due to the appearance of pondering their actions as they prepare to strike, which was copied by medicine men in the build-up to prophecy in parts of West Africa. Usually the wisdom of snakes was regarded as ancient and beneficial towards humans but sometimes it could be directed against humans. In East Asia snake-dragons watched over good harvests, rain, fertility and the cycle of the seasons, whilst in ancient Greece and India, snakes were considered to be lucky and snake-amulets were used as talismans against evil. Tiresias gained a dual male-female nature and an insight into the supernatural world when he killed two snakes which were coupling in the woods. The Biblical story of the fall of man tells of how Adam and Eve were deceived into disobeying God by a snake (identified as Satan by both Paul and John in II Corinthians and Revelation, respectively). In the story, the snake convinces Eve to eat fruit from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, which she then convinces Adam to do as well. As a result, God banishes Adam and Eve from the garden and curses the snake. In the state of Kerala, India, snake shrines occupy most households. Snakes were called upon by the creator of Kerala, Parasurama, to make the saline land fertile. The Mannarasala Shri Nagaraja Temple is one of the main centres of worship. The presiding deity here is Nagaraja - a five-headed snake god born to human parents as a blessing for their caretaking of snakes during a fire. It is believed that Nagaraja left his earthly life and took Samadhi but still resides in a chamber of the temple. Healing Healing and snakes were associated in ancient Greek myth with Aesculapius, whose snake-familiars would crawl across the bodies of sick people asleep at night in his shrines and lick them back to health. In northern Europe and West Asia, snakes were associated with healing whilst in parts of South Asia, snakes are regarded as possessing aphrodisiac qualities. Greek myth held that people could acquire second hearing and second sight if their ears or eyes were licked by a snake. Snake gods The \\"libation vase of Gudea\\" with the dragon Mushussu, dedicated to Ningishzida (twentieth century BC short chronology). The caduceus is interpreted as depicting the god himself. In ancient Mesopotamia, Nirah, the messenger god of I≈°taran, was represented as a serpent on kudurrus, or boundary stones. Representations of two intertwined serpents are common in Sumerian art and Neo-Sumerian artwork and still appear sporadically on cylinder seals and amulets until as late as the thirteenth century BC. The horned viper (Cerastes cerastes) appears in Kassite and Neo-Assyrian kudurrus and is invoked in Assyrian texts as a magical protective entity. A dragon-like creature with horns, the body and neck of a snake, the forelegs of a lion, and the hind-legs of a bird appears in Mesopotamian art from the Akkadian Period until the Hellenistic Period (323 BC‚Äì31 BC). This creature, known in Akkadian as the mu≈°·∏´u≈°≈°u, meaning \\"furious serpent\\", was used as a symbol for particular deities and also as a general protective emblem. It seems to have originally been the attendant of the Underworld god Ninazu, but later became the attendant to the Hurrian storm-god Tishpak, as well as, later, Ninazu's son Ningishzida, the Babylonian national god Marduk, the scribal god Nabu, and the Assyrian national god Ashur. The anthropomorphic basis of many myth-systems meant snake-gods were rarely depicted solely as snakes. Exceptions to this were the Fijian creator-god Ndengei, the dozen creator-gods of the Solomon Islands (each with different responsibilities), the Aztec Mother Goddess Coatlicue, and the Voodoo snake- spirits Damballa, Simbi and Petro. Snake-gods were more often portrayed as hybrids or shape-shifters; for example, North American snake-spirits could change between human and serpentine forms whilst keeping the characteristics of both. Likewise, the Korean snake goddess Eobshin was portrayed as a black snake that had human ears. The most important American snake-god was the Aztec spirit of intelligence and the wind, Quetzalcoatl (\\"Plumed Serpent\\"), who was balanced by the evil spirit of sacrifice, the Serpent of Obsidian Knives which was one of the four pillars supporting the sky. In each case, the association with snakes was based on imagery rather than snake-like qualities. The Mayan sky-goddess was a common attribute. However, in her case, the snakes leaned into her ears and whispered the secrets of the universe (i.e. the secrets of herself). In Indian myth, Shiva had a cobra coiled on his head and another at rest on his shoulder, ready to strike his enemies. Egyptian myth has had several snake-gods, from the 'coiled one' Mehen who assisted Ra in fighting Aapep every day to the two-headed Nehebkau who guarded the underworld. In Korean mythology, the goddess Eobshin was the snake goddess of wealth, as snakes ate rats and mice that gnawed on the crops. The Horned Serpent appears in the mythologies of many Native Americans.Horned serpent, feathered serpent Details vary among tribes, with many of the stories associating the mystical figure with water, rain, lightning and thunder. Horned Serpents were major components of the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex of North American prehistory.

Ecotechnology integrates two fields of study: the 'ecology of technics' and the 'technics of ecology,' requiring an understanding of the structures and processes of ecosystems and societies. All sustainable engineering that can reduce damage to ecosystems, adopt ecology as a fundamental basis, and ensure conservation of biodiversity and sustainable development may be considered as forms of ecotechnology. Ecotechnology emphasizes approaching a problem from a holistic point of view. For example, remediation of rivers should not only consider one single area. Rather, the whole catchment area, which includes the upstream, middle stream and downstream sections, should be considered. Construction can reduce its impact on nature by consulting experts on the environment. Sustainable development requires the implementation of environmentally friendly technologies which are both efficient and adapted to local conditions. Ecotechnology allows improvement in economic performance while minimizing harm to the environment by: * increasing the efficiency in the selection and use of materials and energy sources * control of impacts on ecosystems * development and permanent improvement of cleaner processes and products * eco-marketing * introducing environmental management systems in the production and services sectors * development of activities for increasing awareness of the need for environmental protection and promotion of sustainable development by the general public During Ecotechnics '95 - International Symposium on Ecological Engineering in √ñstersund, Sweden, the participants agreed on the definition: \\"Ecotechnics is defined as the method of designing future societies within ecological frames.\\" See also * Afforestation * Agroforestry * Analog forestry * Biomass * Biomass (ecology) * Buffer strip * Collaborative innovation network * Deforestation * Deforestation during the Roman period * Desertification * Ecological engineering * Ecological engineering methods * Energy-efficient landscaping * Forest farming * Forest gardening * Great Plains Shelterbelt * Hedgerow * Home gardens * Human ecology * Institute of Ecotechnics * Macro-engineering * Megaprojects * Mid Sweden University * Permaculture * Permaforestry * Proposed sahara forest project * Push‚Äìpull technology * Sand fence * Seawater Greenhouse * Sustainable agriculture * Terra preta * Thomas P.

Michael Rossi is a teacher and high school principal who had replaced Abner Firth, the preceding teacher and principal who had died of a heart attack. He becomes the love interest of Constance MacKenzie, a woman with a hidden past. The character of Rossi originally was called Tomas Makris, bearing the name and description of a Laconia resident and co-worker of Metalious's school teacher husband. However, Makris sued for libel, winning an out-of-court settlement for $60,000. Makris was renamed Michael Rossi in later printings, and in the film and TV series which derived from the novel. In editions published in the United Kingdom, he was called Michael Kyros; in Return to Peyton Place, he was named Michael Rossi. In the 1957 movie Peyton Place, Michael Rossi is played by Lee Philips. In the TV series Peyton Place, which ran from 1964 to 1969, the character of Dr. Rossi was played by Ed Nelson. Rossi's profession was changed from high school principal to doctor. The former doctor, Matthew Swain, becomes the editor of the Peyton Place Clarion. In the 1972-1974 daytime series Return to Peyton Place, the role of Dr. Rossi was played by Guy Stockwell.

The segment from 12 Mile Coulee Road to 16 Avenue NW (Trans-Canada Highway, Highway 1) is designated as Highway 1A by Alberta Transportation.  Route description  Crowchild Trail's south terminus is located at North Glenmore Park as a minor arterial road. Exiting northbound from the park the road intersects several residential streets within the communities of Lakeview and North Glenmore Park, and several residential dwellings are located on the Trail itself. Continuing northward, its first major intersection is with Glenmore Trail at an interchange that was built in 1981, which is the point at which Crowchild becomes an freeway. After an interchange was completed at 50th Avenue SW in 2003, Crowchild Trail became a true freeway from Glenmore Trail to Kensington Road NW, with overpasses at Flanders Avenue SW, 33 Avenue SW and 17 Avenue SW and interchange intersections with 10 Avenue SW, Bow Trail and Memorial Drive. The speed limit on the freeway sections are . Traffic slows immediately north of the Bow River (dropping to a principal arterial with a limit), with signal- controlled intersections at Kensington Road NW and 5th Avenue NW, and heavy use by football fans and transit users at McMahon Stadium and students of the University of Calgary. After 24 Avenue NW the road veers northwest, and once again becomes an uninterrupted freeway until the Stoney Trail ring road. A cloverleaf interchange was completed in 2012 at Stoney Trail, rendering Crowchild Trail a freeway from 24 Avenue through to the city limits at Twelve Mile Coulee Road. It continues as Bow Valley Trail, eventually reaching Cochrane and Canmore.  History  Part of this road was the Morley Trail when it was an actual trail. It was first paved in the 1930s. It then became the main highway to Banff and was the home of Eamon's Bungalow Camp and service station. When the Trans-Canada Highway was created it dropped in importance. The road was originally signed as 24 Street SW from North Glenmore Park to the Bow River, 24th Street NW from the Bow River to the intersection with 16 Avenue NW, and Highway 1A from 16 Avenue NW to the city limits. In March 1971, it was renamed Crowchild Trail in honour of David Crowchild, Chief of the Tsuu T'ina Nation from 1946 to 1953.  Future  In the spring of 2017, the City of Calgary approved the recommendations of the Crowchild Trail Study which addressed the congestion and design issues between 17 Avenue SW and 24 Avenue NW. Short-term improvements include adding additional lanes across the Bow River and modifying the Bow Trail and Memorial Drive interchanges; construction commenced in fall 2017 and was scheduled to be completed in fall 2019, since then, the completion date has been pushed back to fall 2020. Medium-term improvements include new interchanges at Kensington Road, 5 Avenue NW, and 24 Avenue NW, as well as replacement of the existing University Drive and 16 Avenue NW interchanges. Once the medium-term recommendations would be implemented, the remaining traffic signals would be removed and Crowchild Trail would be a freeway between Glenmore Trail and 12 Mile Coulee Road. Major intersections From south to north, the following intersections are observed along Crowchild Trail.

The race followed a modified version of the northern route for 1,151 mi (1,852 km) across the Alaska Range, through the sparsely inhabited Interior, along the Yukon River, and then up the coast of the Bering Sea to the city of Nome. Unlike in previous years, where the teams had to deal with unseasonably warm temperatures and soft, mushy snow, the weather was cold, with temperatures reported as low as ‚àí40 ¬∞F (‚àí40 ¬∞C). Eighty three competitors started the race, eleven \\"scratched\\", and one was withdrawn from the race. The field of racers was extremely competitive, with pundits like Cabela's John Little listing more than half a dozen possible winners. The ultimate winner was Jeff King, who crossed under the \\"burled arch\\" on March 15, becoming one of the few four-time champions.St. George, March 15, 2006, King makes it number four. Fellow four-time winner Doug Swingley of Montana came in 2nd place, followed by Paul Gebhardt. Each of the 83 teams was composed of 16 dogs, four of whom died during the event. Note: All times are Alaska Standard Time/AKST (UTC-9). Competitors There were 83 mushers that entered to race. The 51 Alaskans included four-time champion and speed-record holder Martin Buser, three-time winner Jeff King, 2004 winner Mitch Seavey, and the only five-time champion Rick Swenson, including a few Alaska Natives like Ramy Brooks, John Baker, and Ed Iten. There were 23 mushers as well from the lower 48 states, including four-time champion Doug Swingley. Internationally, Canada is represented by three-time Yukon Quest winner Hans Gatt, Karen Ramstead, the owner of the only all-Siberian Husky team in the race, Sebastian Schnuelle, and rookie Warren Palfrey. Norway had three mushers in the race in that year, the 2005 rookie of the year, Bj√∏rnar Andersen, and newcomers Tore Albrigtsen and Tove S√∏rensen (2005 champion Robert S√∏rlie is not racing this year). Fabrizio Lovati of Italy and Ben Valks of the Netherlands brought the European total to 5 mushers. Celebrity mushers included Gary Paulsen, who ran his rookie race in 1983, scratched in 1985, withdrew prior to the race in 2005, and became the first musher to scratch in 2006, on March 6 at 1:08 a.m. at Skwentna. Legally blind musher Rachael Scdoris of Bend, Oregon, has also attempted the Iditarod for the second time, after she scratched in Eagle Island in 2005. Her visual interpreter for that year was Tim Osmar. According to Iditarod reporter Little, the field was just as competitive as it was during the 2005 Iditarod, making it very hard to pick a winner. Former champions Buser, King, Swingley, and Seavey were all strong candidates to win. Of that elite crowd, King won the Kobuk 440 last year and the Kusko this year; while five-time winner Swenson, who scratched for the first time in 2005, is probably out of the running. The last of the likely winners is Bj√∏rnar Andersen. As this year's representative of Team Norway, he inherited half of Robert S√∏rlie's winning 2005 team of dogs, and even without them Andersen's 4th-place finish in 2004 was the best finish by a rookie since the race first started in the 1970s.Little, March 4, 2006 (1). Other racers who expected to finish well were Lance Mackey, who won the 1,000 mi (1,600 km) Yukon Quest, three-time runner up DeeDee Jonrowe, 2005's 2nd-place finisher Ed Iten, two- time runner up Ramy Brooks, perennial top-10er John Baker. A third tier of capable racers included winner of the 2005 Klondike 300 Cim Smyth (who also recorded the fastest time from Safety to Nome in 2005, despite only having 5 dogs left), Jessie Royner, winner of the 2005 Sheep Mountain 150 Ken Andersen, Aaron Burmeister, 2nd-place finisher in the 2005 Klondike 300 Matt Hayashida, Melanie Gould, Paul Gebhardt, and former Yukon Quest winner Aliy Zirkle. A win by either Aliy Zirkle or Lance Mackey would place them in the elite company of mushers to have won both the Yukon Quest and the Iditarod ‚Äî in Lance's case, in the same year, an historical first. Hans Gatt is normally a contender, but this year he is running a team of young, inexperienced dogs. Warren Palfrey of Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, Tore Albrigtsen or Tove Sorensen from Norway were likely candidates for rookie of the year.  Awards  Doug Swingley won the PenAir Spirit of Alaska Award on March 8 at 0:12 a.m. for being the first to reach McGrath, on the bank of the Kuskokwim River.

One musher was withdrawn from the race. Withdrawing a musher is at the sole discretion of Race Marshall Mark Nordman: # Ben Valks of the Netherlands was withdrawn from the race after arriving in Shaktoolik on March 18 at 4:00 p.m. as the red lantern in last place. According to Norman's report, \\"Valks had taken good care of his team and himself throughout the race, but that in his judgment Valks' team was no longer considered competitive\\".Nordman, March 18.  Canine fatalities  Each of the 83 teams was composed of 16 dogs at the start of the competitive race in Willow. Mushers are allowed to drop dogs at any checkpoint, usually because of concern over their performance, but also or for their health. Veterinarians examine the dogs at each checkpoint, and also have the discretion to withdraw dogs. Dropped dogs are flown to Anchorage or Nome, where they are provided with medical care. Teams are usually reduced to between 9 and 12 dogs by the time they arrived in Nome. An average of 3 dogs die each year. A necropsy by a board certified veterinary pathologist is conducted after every fatality to determine the cause of death. # Yellowknife, a 4-year-old male from Noah Burmeister's team, died on March 9 at 6:00 a.m.. Yellowknife was initially dropped at Rohn on March 7, and was provided medical care in Anchorage.Nordman, March 9 (1). The preliminary necropsy indicated pneumonia as the cause of death.Nordman, March 9 (2). # Bear, a 3-year-old male from David Sawatzsky's team, died on March 11 between Cripple and Ruby.Nordman, March 11. The gross necropsy found no abnormalities.Nordman, March 13 (1). # Cupid, a 4-year-old female from Jim Lanier's team, died on March 12 between Galena and Nulato.Nordman, March 12. The gross necropsy found regurgitation and aspiration were the likely cause of death, and secondarily gastric ulcers.Nordman, March 13 (2). # Jack, a 5-year-old male from Wisconsin musher Ron Cortte's team, died on March 18 at White Mountain. Jack was examined by veterinarians on arrival and appeared normal, but died of unknown causes 30 min later.  Route  The race ran over the Alaska Range, where an avalanche claimed the life of Richard Strick Jr. in mid-February, into the former Gold Rush country of the Alaska Interior, past Athabaskan villages. Since 2006 is an even numbered year, the race followed the northern route from Ophir, past the halfway point at Cripple, before rejoining the main route at Kaltag, on the Yukon River. From Kaltag the race swings west to the Norton Sound, on coast of the Bering Sea.  March 4: Ceremonial start in Anchorage  Ceremonial start at Anchorage: The mushers departed Anchorage on March 4, 2006. A large crowd watched as 83 teams composed of a musher and twelve dogs pulling a dogsled, left the starting chute at the corner of Fourth and D Streets, and followed the 11 mi (18 km) route through the urban center. The mushers were accompanied on the sled by \\"Idita-riders\\", the high bidders in a pre-race auction. Eagle River: After the mushers arrived at Eagle River, the dogs were transported by vehicle to the \\"restart\\" location. Normally this is at Wasilla, the headquarters of the Iditarod Trail Committee, and the race continues from there to the next checkpoint at Knik, before reaching Yentna Station. In 2006, the restart was pushed back to Willow, and continued on directly to Yentna, skipping Wasilla and Knik entirely.  March 5: Restart at Willow  Restart at Willow: The mushers departed the Community of Willow two minutes apart, in Bib order. The first musher (Loni Townsend, Bib 2) left on March 5 at 2:00 p.m. AKST, and the last (Paul Gebhardt, Bib 83) left 2 hr 44 min later at 4:44 p.m. The teams were increased to 16 dogs each.

It was a member of Abelisauridae, closely related to genera such as Carnotaurus. The only known remains of this genus are leg bones which share certain similarities to a variety of abelisaurids. However, these bones lack unique features, which may render Quilmesaurus a nomen vanum (more commonly known as a nomen dubium, or \\"dubious name\\"). Discovery and naming Skeletal diagram During the late 1980s, a field crew from the Universidad Nacional Tucum√°n, led by Jaime Powell, uncovered forty kilometres south of Roca City, in R√≠o Negro province, southern Argentina, the remains of a theropod near the Salitral Ojo de Agua. In 2001, Rodolfo An√≠bal Coria named and described the type species Quilmesaurus curriei. The genus name is derived from the Quilme, a Native American people, and the specific name honours Dr. Philip John Currie, a Canadian theropod specialist. The holotype and currently only specimen was designated the collection number MPCA-PV-100, in the Museo Provincial \\"Carlos Ameghino\\". It consists of the distal (lower or outermost) half of the right femur (thighbone), and a complete right tibia (inner shinbone), collected from the Allen Formation of the Malarg√ºe Group in the Neuqu√©n Basin. These deposits date from the Campanian to Maastrichtian. The specimen came from the fluvial sandstones at the bottom of the Allen Formation. The taxon is notable as it represents one of the youngest records of a non-avian theropod from Patagonia. Description The partial femur of Quilmesaurus (A-D) compared to that of Carnotaurus (E-G) The preserved portion of femur is robust and boxy in shape. The rear face of the tip of the bone possessed prominent condyles (joint bumps) for connecting to the tibia (on the inner face of the leg) and fibula (on the outer face of the leg). The lateral condyle (which connected to the fibula) is slightly lower from front-to-back compared to the medial condyle (which connected to the tibia), but it is also wider from side-to-side. An additional finger-like bone spur (an epicondyle) would have also been present on the lateral condyle, although this spur is broken off in the only known Quilmesaurus femur. Just above the medial condyle is a low yet noticeable ridge which juts away from the rest of the bone, towards the midline of the animal's body. This ridge is known as a mesiodistal crest. The area immediately above the condyles possesses a shallow yet wide lowered area known as an extensor groove. Overall the femur is almost identical to that of other abelisaurids. Life restorationThe proximal (upper or innermost) part of the tibia possesses a myriad of complex features. A large and hatchet-shaped structure known as a cnemial crest points forwards at the proximal portion of the tibia. The tip of the cnemial crest is hooked due to the presence of a downward pointing spur, known as a ventral process. Although Coria (2001) considered a hooked cnemial crest to be unique to Quilmesaurus, Valieri et al. (2007) noted that this structure was also possessed by Aucasaurus and Majungasaurus, as well as the ambiguous abelisaurid Genusaurus. The distal part of the tibia possesses its own projections for connecting to ankle bones, known as malleoli. This part has the form of an asymmetrical triangle when seen from the front, with the massive lateral malleolus projecting further distally than the smaller medial malleolus. This combination of distal tibia features was also once presumed to have been unique to Quilmesaurus. However, Valieri et al. (2007) note that the distal tibia of Rajasaurus was very similar to that of Quilmesaurus. In 2016, Quilmesaurus was estimated to have measured in length. This would have made it among the smallest derived abelisaurids, although its legs were proportionally robust like those of Pycnonemosaurus, one of the largest members of the family. Classification When originally described, Coria could not find a more precise placement for Quilmesaurus than Theropoda. The presence of a notch in the distal articular surface of the tibia was cited by him as evidence of a possible relationship with basal Tetanurae, which would be surprising as Quilmesaurus lived during a time when South American theropod assemblages were dominated by abelisaurids and carcharodontosaurs. Other theropod material has been recovered from within these same strata and has in 2005 also provisionally been referred to the Tetanurae.Coria, R.A. & Salgado, L. 2005. \\"Last Patagonian theropods\\". In: Carpenter, K. 2005. The Carnivorous Dinosaurs, Indiana University Press, pp 153-160 However, in a 2004 abstract (and later a 2007 full paper), Rub√©n Ju√°rez Valieri et al. concluded that Quilmesaurus, in view of the hatchet- shaped cnemial crest, was a member of the Abelisauridae.Ju√°rez Valieri R.D, Fiorelli L.E. and Cruz, L.E. 2004. \\"Quilmesaurus curriei Coria, 2001. Su validez taxon√≥mica y relaciones filogen√©ticas\\". XX Jornadas Argentinas de Paleontolog√≠a de Vertebrados (La Plata), Res√∫menes, p. 36-37 Unlike members of Megalosauroidea, the tibia of Quilmesaurus does not possess a noticeable anteromedial buttress, and instead it includes a large cnemial crest. Quilmesaurus is also not a coelurosaur due to the distal part of the tibia being asymmetrical in shape as well as having a socket for the astragalus which is lower than that of coelurosaurs. Finally, the shallow and wide (rather than deep and thin) extensor groove excludes Quilmesaurus from Carnosauria, as does the possession of parallel upper and lower edges of the cnemial crest. However, some features do support its placement within Ceratosauria. These include a pronounced cnemial crest of the tibia and large mesiodistal crest of the femur. The asymmetrical distal part of the tibia and small socket for the astragalus specifically place it within the family Abelisauridae. The preserved bones share features with various abelisaurid taxa throughout the family, although such similarities are widespread and seemingly pop up at random among the taxa, thus making more specific placement difficult. The hook-like shape of the cnemial crest suggests that Quilmesaurus was a member of the subfamily Carnotaurinae, which Sereno (1998) defined to include all abelisaurids closer to Carnotaurus than to Abelisaurus.Size comparison of Quilmesaurus (far right) with other \\"carnotaurins\\"However, the validity of Carnotaurinae has been debated. Although Valieri et al. (2007) considered the subfamily to include taxa such as Majungasaurus, Carnotaurus, Aucasaurus, and Rajasaurus, other studies have found different results. Tortosa et al. (2014) found that Carnotaurinae was an invalid group, as very few abelisaurids could actually apply to the definition set forth by Sereno. According to their analysis, Aucusaurus and Carnotaurus were actually closer to Abelisaurus than they were to Majungasaurus and Rajasaurus, thus forcing the latter two taxa to be excluded from the subfamily. Quilmesaurus was retained as close to Aucasaurus and Carnotaurus, although Sereno's name and definition of Carnotaurinae was completely demolished. In its place the tribe Carnotaurini was used, which includes all abelisaurids descended from the last common ancestor of Aucusaurus and Carnotaurus. Tortosa et al. (2014)'s result has largely been supported over that of Valieri et al. (2007). Filippi et al. (2016) created a new clade, Furileusauria, to include abelisaurids more closely related to Carnotaurus than to Ilokelesia, Skorpiovenator, or Majungasaurus. They included Quilmesaurus among the furileusaurians. Valieri et al. (2007) were unable to establish a single autapomorphy (distinctive or unique trait) of the taxon, concluding that Quilmesaurus were a nomen vanum. Paleoecology The Allen Formation is believed to have been a humid coastal environment which gradually transitioned from a freshwater floodplain to marshy estuaries and then shallow lagoons as sea levels rose. A diverse assemblage of aquatic life inhabited the area, including various fish, frogs, and turtles. More recent intervals of the formation even include a few marine reptiles, such as various plesiosaurs including elasmosaurids and polycotylids. Plant life includes palm trees and conifers of the family Podocarpeaceae (\\"plum pines\\"), which formed dense forests and wetlands.Quilmesaurus watching Saltasaurus Remains of land animals were also common in this formation. An indeterminate rhynchocephalian is known, as well as numerous snake taxa including the madtsoiids Patagoniophis and Alamitophis. Other non-dinosaur animals in the area include the pterosaur Aerotitan and a variety of mammals. Dinosaur remains recovered from the Allen Formation include a diverse and abundant assortment of titanosaurs (Saltasaurus, Aeolosaurus, Laplatasaurus, Rocasaurus, etc.) and a hadrosaurid of dubious validity (Willinakaqe). Theropods other than Quilmesaurus were also present; they include the large unenlagiine dromaeosaurid Austroraptor, a basal ornithuran bird (Limenavis), and a cimolopterygid bird (Lamarqueavis). A tooth has been referred to the family Carcharodontosauridae; this tooth is one of the most recent carcharondontosaurid fossils found as more well known members of this family (Giganotosaurus, Mapusaurus) lived millions of years earlier in the Cretaceous. Indeterminate nodosaurid remains have also been found at this formation, consisting of vertebrae, osteoderms, a femur, and a tooth. The Allen Formation is also notable for the high amount of sauropod eggs discovered there. Nesting grounds have been discovered in the bajo de Santa Rosa area of the upper Allen Formation. Some (but not all) of these eggs were designated as the oogenus Sphaerovum. The structure of their eggshells indicate that they were laid in a very damp environment.

The Boeing KB-29 was a modified Boeing B-29 Superfortress for air refueling needs by the USAF. Two primary versions were developed and produced: KB-29M and KB-29P. The 509th and 43d Air Refueling Squadrons (Walker AFB, NM and Davis-Monthan AFB, AZ respectively) were created in 1948 to operate the KB-29M tankers. The 303d Bombardment Wing at Davis-Monthan AFB flew B-29s and KB-29s from 1951 to 1953 that provided training for strategic bombardment and air refueling operations to meet SAC's global commitments.Strategic-Air- Command.com's 303d BW Davis-Monthan AFB Deployed at Sidi Slimane AB, French Morocco, 5 Oct ‚Äì 6 November 1952. Variants KB-29M : Section source: Baugher and NationalNational Museum Fact Sheet on KB-29M/MR variants Official Site The B-29 played an important role in developing the effective use of aerial refueling during the late 1940s. The first aircraft involved in this programme were the KB-29M tanker and B-29MR receiver. At first, a grappling system, known as the looped hose method, was used; the tanker would enter formation flight behind, above and to the left of the receiver. It would then unreel a hauling cable attached to a 55lb weight (to make it dangle near vertically). The receiver would trail a hauling cable ending in a drag cone (to make this trail near horizontally) and a grapnel. With both cables trailed, the tanker would cross to the right of the receiver so the two cables snagged each other. With cables snagged, the tanker hauled both into its fuselage where the receiver's cable was connected to the tanker's hose. This was then hauled into the receiver. After connecting with internal fuel compartments pumping would begin. When the receiver was full the process was reversed allowing the tanker to recover its hose and the receiver its hauling cable. While this system was clumsy, it was often used in the late 1940s before a better system was developed. It was most notably used to refuel the Lucky Lady II during her famous circumnavigation of the globe in 1949. This helped sway the argument as to whether the USAF or US Navy should provide the US's nuclear delivery capability. The USAF won with the consequential massive expansion of the USAF's Strategic Air Command and cancellation of the US Navy's super carriers. The looped hose method was only of use with large multi crew planes since crew members were required to assist in the hauling in. A modified method known as the probe and drogue system was developed to allow single seat aircraft to be refuelled in the air. With jet fighters suffering from short range there was a need for these to be refuelled in the air and several KB-29Ms were modified to use 'probe-and-drogue' systems, in which the refueling hose has a torus-shaped para-drogue attached to the end, and the receiving aircraft has a probe on its nose or wing, which the pilot manoeuvers into the drogue to link the hose. One KB-29M, redesignated YKB-29T, was modified to have another two refueling hoses on its wingtip. It served as the prototype for the KB-50D. The refuelling systems were developed and installed by Flight Refuelling Ltd, at Tarrant Rushton in the United Kingdom. KB-29P : Section source: Baugher and NationalNational Museum Fact Sheet on KB-29P variant Official Site KB-29P tanker of 420th Air Refueling Squadron based at RAF Sculthorpe Norfolk in 1956 In an effort to improve on the probe- and-drogue system, Boeing developed a rigid flying boom system, which was first used on the KB-29P. The boom was mounted on the aftmost end of the KB-29P, and used a V-tail-like set of control surfaces for stabilization at its far end. With the V-tail-style surfaces, still used on most USAF tanker aircraft in the 21st century, the boom could be manoeuvered by the operator. The flying boom system was selected by SAC as the preferred method for refuelling their bombers and, because of the massive size attained by SAC, it became the most common method for In-Flight Refueling in the USAF and was used on KC-97s and also on modern tankers such as the KC-135 Stratotanker, the KC-10 Extender, and the KC-46 Pegasus. The KB-29P was operated by 420th Air Refueling Squadron based at RAF Sculthorpe Norfolk during the mid-1950s. From 1954 to 1957, the 407th Air Refueling Squadron was based at Great Falls Air Force Base. Later the base name was changed to Malmstrom Air Force Base.

It is similar to sangria, but simpler, being normally made up of 1 part of table red wine and 1 part gaseosa (a general term for sodas and carbonated drinks), although proportions can vary according to taste. The preferred mixer is a mild-flavored, low-sugar, carbonated lemonade, of which La Casera is the best known brand. Traditional gaseosa can be replicated by mixing Sprite or 7-Up with carbonated water. The drink is served over ice, often with a slice of lemon or orange. Rum is sometimes added to the drink.Spanish Tinto De Verano from Recipezaar Other variations include red wine mixed with and lemon soda, orange soda, or bitter lemon; ros√© wine mixed with lemon or orange soda; and red wine mixed with cola (known as calimocho). The drink has its origins in the early 20th century, when Federico Vargas created a mix of a red wine and soda pop for his patrons at Venta Vargas in Cordoba, Spain. The drink was at first called un Vargas but soon came to be known as Tinto de Verano. As the name suggests, tinto de verano is usually served during the summertime. It is often home-made, or bought ready-bottled from supermarkets. In the Costa del Sol and other Southern regions of Spain it is common for locals to drink tinto de verano as it is easy to make oneself, or has many variations of preprepared varieties for the same price as many cola drinks. Sangria is considered more commercial and \\"touristy\\" as it requires more time to make and is often sold in restaurants at a more expensive price, whereas tinto de verano is common at parties, festivals, and dive bars where drinks are affordable and consumed in volume.

Venerated in popular epics and legends, the Baitarani River is a source of water for agricultural irrigation. Most of the potentially arable land in the area is not under cultivation. The coastal plain of Odisha has the name of \\"Hexadeltaic region\\" or the \\"Gift of Six Rivers\\". These deltas divide the coastal plain into three regions from north to south. The Baitarani, the Mahanadi and the Brahmani rivers form the Middle Coastal Plain, with evidence of past \\"back bays\\" and present lakes. Source Gonasika, origin point of Baitarani The Baitarani originates from the Gonasika/Guptaganga (Cow Nose Shaped) hills, and starts flowing over a stone looking like the nostril of a cow. Afterwards for about half a kilometre the river flows underground and is not visible from outside. The Baitarani is known here by the name Guptaganga or the Gupta Baitarani, in Gonasika of Keonjhar district in Odisha state of India at an elevation of above sea level. The uppermost part of the river, about in length, flows in a northerly direction; then it changes its path suddenly by 90 degrees and flows eastward. The beginning portion of Baitarani acts as the small part of boundary between the states of Odisha and Jharkhand.https://www.google.co.in/maps/place/Baitarani+River/@22.0327151,85.5508481,12.17z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x3a1bed59355fc723:0x5f1391d2ee80e5b0!8m2!3d21.430626!4d86.1091555 Course The river enters a plain at Anandapur and creates a deltaic zone at Akhuapada. The river travels a distance of to drain into the Bay of Bengal after joining of the Brahmani at Dhamra mouth near Chandabali. The river has 65 tributaries, of which 35 join from the left side and 30 join from the right side. The river basin in Odisha is spread among 42 blocks of eight districts. Budhi, Kanjori, Ambajhara, Mushal, Kusei, Salandi are some of the tributaries of Baitarani. Location A major portion of the river basin lies within the state of Odisha, while a small patch of the upper reach lies in Jharkhand state. The upper Baitarani basin on the western slopes of the Eastern Ghats, comprising the Panposh-Keonjhar-Pallahara plateau, is one of the two plateaus forming \\"The Central Plateaus\\"‚Äîone of Odisha's five major morphological regions. Dams and barrages Dams and barrages on the Baitarani and its major tributary, the Salandi, irrigate . The proposed Bhimkund and upper Baitarani multi-purpose projects envisage many more dams across this river and its tributaries to provide irrigation to more than . A new barrage was established near Anandapur and it was inaugurated by the CM of Odisha, Naveen Patnaik. Flooding Flooding is a regular phenomenon in the Baitarani basin. The inhabitants, near the river, live in a fear of loss to life and property. Even a two-day rain in July 2005 caused the river to overflow its banks, affecting 140,000 people in 220 villages of Jajpur and Bhadrak districts. In at least two places the embankments were breached and marooning occurred, inflicting massive losses of life and property. Apart from the long pending construction of a dam at Bhimkund and proposed other measures like river bed excavation and construction of embankments etc. in the deltaic region, there remain the unaddressed land use issues in the upstream, to which, till date, no serious thoughts or efforts have been directed. Industry and water quality Due to drainage into the Bay of Bengal, its water become salty as it heads towards the end of the River. Baitarani basin, with its rich mineral and agricultural resources and with availability of cheap labour, offered an ideal ground for establishment and operation of various industries. However, the principal development activities in the industrial, agricultural and mining sectors have contributed significantly towards deterioration in the water quality. Baitarani River Basin Project Cultural impact It forms part of the boundary between Balasore district and Cuttack district. There is a saying that \\"he who bathes in it and gives alms will always be free from torments inflicted by Yama.\\" The district Jajpur is the gift of river Baitarani. Historical evidences show early civilization on the bank of this river. Currently the district is subject to massive floods which are common during monsoon.

Yunnanosaurus was a large sized, moderately-built, ground-dwelling, quadrupedal herbivore, that could also walk bipedally, and ranged in size from 7 meters (23 feet) long and 2 m (6.5 ft) high to 4 m (13 ft) high in the largest species. Discovery Reconstructed skeletons of Yunnanosaurus and Sinosaurus, Kunming City Museum Yang Zhongjian (also known as C. C. Young) discovered the first Yunnanosaurus skeletons in the Lufeng Formation of Yunnan, China. The fossil find was composed of over twenty incomplete skeletons, including two skulls, it was excavated by Tsun Yi Wang. When first discovered, Yunnanosaurus was considered to be closely related to Lufengosaurus, but more recent research by Novas et al. (2011) shows that it is most closely related to Anchisaurus and Jingshanosaurus.Fernando E. Novas, Martin D. Ezcurra, Sankar Chatterjee and T. S. Kutty (2011). \\"New dinosaur species from the Upper Triassic Upper Maleri and Lower Dharmaram formations of central India\\". Earth and Environmental Science Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 101 (3-4): 333‚Äì349. doi:10.1017/S1755691011020093 The type specimen of Yunnanosaurus youngi was recovered at the Banqing Houshanliangzi locality of the Zhanghe Formation, in Yuanmou County of Yunnan Province, China. The holotype specimen CXMVZA 185 was collected in 2000 in terrestrial sediments deposited during the Aalenian and Bajocian stages of the Middle Jurassic period, approximately 174 to 168 million years ago. This specimen is housed in the collection of the Chuxiong Museum. In 2007, L√º Junchang and colleagues described another species of Yunnanosaurus, Y. youngi (named in honor of C. C. Young). In addition to various skeletal differences, at 13 meters (42 ft) long Y. youngi was significantly larger than Y. huangi (which reached only 7 meters [23 ft]). Y. youngi is found later in the fossil record, hailing from the Middle Jurassic. The holotype specimen CXMVZA 185 consists of ten cervical vertebrae, fourteen dorsal vertebrae, three fused sacral vertebrae, seventeen caudal vertebrae, both pubic bones, both ischia, and the right illium. The skull of this species is not known.Lu, J., Li, T., Zhong, S., Azuma, Y., Fujita, M., Dong, Z., and Ji, Q.

In 2013, Sekiya et al. described the discovery of a juvenile individual which was assigned to what the authors termed \\"Yunnanosaurus robustus\\" (i.e. Y. huangi). Specimen ZMNH-M8739 consists of partial cranial material and an almost complete post-cranial skeleton. This individual possesses characteristic dentition that suggests a potentially unique feeding mechanism as evidenced a tooth‚Äìtooth wear facet on its mesial maxillary and dentary teeth, and maxillary teeth that have coarse serrations. Comparison of this juvenile specimen with adult specimens of Yunnanosaurus huangi reveals very distinctive growth changes.Toru Sekiya, Xingsheng Jin, Wenjie Zheng, Masateru Shibata & Yoichi Azuma (2013) A new juvenile specimen of Yunnanosaurus robustus (Dinosauria: Sauropodomorpha) from Early to Middle Jurassic of Chuxiong Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan Province, China. Historical Biology (advance online publication) DOI:10.1080/08912963.2013.821702 Description Size of Y. huangi (light green) and Y. youngi (dark green) Dentition There were more than sixty spoon shaped teeth in the jaws of Yunnanosaurus, and were unique among early sauropodomorphs in that its teeth were self-sharpening because they \\"[wore] against each other as the animal fed.\\"\\"Yunnanosaurus.\\" In: Dodson, Peter & Britt, Brooks & Carpenter, Kenneth & Forster, Catherine A. & Gillette, David D. & Norell, Mark A. & Olshevsky, George & Parrish, J. Michael & Weishampel, David B. The Age of Dinosaurs. Publications International, LTD. p. 47. . Scientists consider these teeth to be advanced compared to other early sauropodomorphs, as they share features with the sauropods. However, scientists do not consider Yunnanosaurus to be especially close to the sauropods in phylogeny because the remaining portions of the animals body are distinctly \\"prosauropod\\" in design. This critical difference implies that the similarity in dentition between Yunnanosaurus and sauropods might be an example of convergent evolution.

C. Young in 1942, who erected the family Yunnanosauridae to contain it, though the family currently comprises only this genus and sometimes Jingshanosaurus.Young, C. C. (1942). \\"Yunnanosaurus huangi Young (gen. et sp. nov.), a new Prosauropoda from the red beds at Lufeng, Yunnan.\\" Bulletin of the Geological Society of China, 22 (1-2): 63-104. Young also named a second species, Y. robustus, in 1951,Young, C. C. (1951). \\"The Lufeng saurischian fauna in China.\\" Paleontologica Sinica, ser. C, 13: 1-96. but this has since been included in the type species. The confusion in classification arose due to that the earliest specimens of Y. huangi were of juveniles individuals while the \\"Y. robustus\\" specimens represented fully grown adults. Yunnanosaurus had been assigned to several taxa over the years, including Thecodontosauridae and Plateosauridae, but more recent phylogenetic analysis conducted by Novas et al. (2011) shows that this genus is part of the taxon Massopoda in a clade with Anchisaurus and Jingshanosaurus. Apaldetti et al. (2011) also found that Yunnanosaurus belonged in Massopoda, but found that this genus was more primitive than both Jingshanosaurus and Anchisaurus. Distinguishing anatomical features A diagnosis is a statement of the anatomical features of an organism (or group) that collectively distinguish it from all other organisms. Some, but not all, of the features in a diagnosis are also autapomorphies. An autapomorphy is a distinctive anatomical feature that is unique to a given organism. According to Sekiya et al. (2013), Yunnanosaurus can be distinguished from other dinosaurs based on the following characteristics: * the absence of the anteroposterior expansion on the medial end of the astragalus * the medium shaft of the metatarsal IV is dorsoventrally compressed According to Lu et a. (2007), Yunnanosaurus youngi can be distinguished from Yunnanosaurus huangi based on the following characteristics: * the sixth cervical vertebra is the longest among the vertebral column * the neural spines of the posterior cervical vertebrae are short with an expanded distal end, which is wider than its anteroposterior length * three sacral vertebrae are tightly fused with a stout sacrocostal yoke * the ventral margin of the postacetabular process of the ilium is slightly concave * the ischium is longer than the pubis * the distal end of the pubis is round Paleoecology The type specimens of Yunnanosaurus huangi and Yunnanosaurus robustus were recovered in the Huangchiatien (Dahungtien) locality of the Lufeng Formation in Yunnan, China. The Y. huangi holotype specimen IVPP V20 and the Y. robustus holotype specimen IVPP V93, were collected by Chung Chien Young in terrestrial sediments from the upper dark/deep red beds of the Zhangjiawa Member of this formation, that are believed to have been deposited during the Sinemurian stage of the Jurassic period, approximately 199 to 190 million years ago.Luo, Z., and X.-C. Wu. 1994. The small tetrapods of the Lower Lufeng Formation, Yunnan, China; pp. 251‚Äì270 in N. C. Fraser and H.-D.Sues (eds.), In the Shadow of the Dinosaurs. Cambridge University Press, New York Several other specimens assigned to Y. huangi (IVPP V54, IVPP V47, IVPP V61, IVPP V62, IVPP V63, IVPP V96, IVPP V264), and Y. robustus (IVPP V39, IVPP V94) were also recovered by Young in this locality. These specimens are all housed in the collection of the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, in Beijing, China. In the years to come several more specimens assigned to these two species were recovered from Zhangjiawa Member of this formation. Chung Chien Young had also explored the lower dark/dull purple beds of the Shawan Member of the Lufeng Formation and found more specimens that he later assigned to Y. huangi. Specimen IVPP V32 was collected by Young in 1938 in dark red, argillaceous sandstone that is believed to have been deposited during the Hettangian stage of the Jurassic period, approximately 201 to 199 million years ago. Specimens IVPP V57, IVPP V60 and IVPP V272 were collected by Young in blue mudstone from the same formation and were also assigned to Y. huangi. These specimens from the Shawan Member are also housed in the collection of the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology. Yunnanosaurus huangi and Yunnanosaurus robustus shared their paleoenvironment with the ornithischians Bienosaurus, and Tatisaurus, the sauropodomorphs Gyposaurus, Lufengosaurus, and Jingshanosaurus, and the theropods Sinosaurus triassicus and Eshanosaurus.

The Dobsons would later go on to become the head writers of another Procter and Gamble soap opera, As the World Turns where they created the infamous character of James Stenbeck and also paired the characters of Tom and Margo. In 1984, NBC debuted Santa Barbara where Bridget and Jerome Dobson had creative control of the show's storylines until they were locked out of Santa Barbara's NBC offices in 1988 after the Dobson's repeated attempts to fire then head writer, Anne Howard Bailey. The Dobson's filed a $53 million lawsuit against NBC and New World Television (the company that owned SB). That same year, when claiming Santa Barbara's Outstanding Daytime Drama Emmy, a bittersweet Bridget Dobson taunted, \\"Though New World Television locked me out of the studio, they couldn't lock me out of the Emmys!\\" By 1991 the case was settled out of court and the Dobsons returned to the show they created.

It was one brief set out by Opel CEO Carl-Peter Forster, to designers at the design studios of Opel and Saab, and was led by executive director of design, Martin Smith, and chief designer Stefan Arndt, and built at Corrozzeria Coggiola, in Italy. This concept influenced future small car designs for the brand of Opel, such as the Opel Agila of May 2007. It was expected, in February 2010, that a new concept car, based on the Trixx, would appear in the Paris Motor Show in the autumn of 2010, but this did not occur. Another concept car, that was expected to develop, was an electric concept car based on the Ampera, as well as the Trixx, in May 2009, but this, also, did not occur. The 3m long car features an asymmetrical door layout, with one pantograph door, on the driver side, and one pantograph door, plus one sliding power on the passenger side, together with another sliding roof hatch, for large cargo. A cycle rack is concealed, in the pull out rear bumper feature. The Trixx is powered by one 1.3 litre diesel engine, with common rail direct injection. This gives the Trixx the claimed top speed of 70 mph (112.6 km/h). The Trixx featured the layout of Flex 3, with seating for three adults, plus one child on the folding seat, or convert to the one seater, plus one large 1,010 litre luggage area. The rear passenger seat is inflatable, to save space when not in use, and is inflated when pulling up the head restraint.

Government establishment A government of a nation state may define its date of establishment by: *Declaration of independence from a now-foreign power, e.g. June 1776 of the United States of America *Ratification of its constitution *Signing of a treaty ending a revolutionary war Other definitions of establishment are also possible. University establishment A university may define its date of establishment as: *The date at which the papers of its incorporation was approved *The date on which it first opened for the teaching of classes *If the university derived from a previously-established institution, either the reorganization or the establishment of the parent institution Other definitions of the date on which a university was established are also possible, as considered reasonable by the university's governing body or executive officers. Institution establishment Ultimately an established date of an institution either is decided upon as an internal matter by that institution or is decided for that institution by a normative higher authority outside that institution. For all institutions falling into a particular type of similar institutions, if the date of establishment is not decided by the same authority using the same criteria variations in the definition of the date of establishment can arise.

Federal Register 52: 675-679. https://ecos.fws.gov/docs/federal_register/fr1017.pdf In 2016, the conservation status of the Santa Cruz cypress changed to Threatened. The cited reasoning was a decrease in threats against their habitat. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. 2016.

Individuals can grow 10 to 25 meters tall with branches 5-10cm in diameter covering the trunk to nearly the ground. The shape of the tree is pyramidal, with branches longer toward the base.Peattie, Donald Culross. A Natural History of Western Trees; Illustrated by Paul Landacre. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1953. p . 246-247. Print. The tree‚Äôs leaves are light green and scale-like and can grow up to 15mm in length, persisting on branches for many years. The bark of the trunk is fibrous with thin grey vertical stripes. Individuals begin to produce cones at 11 years in age. Pollen cones can grow up to 4mm long and produce large amounts of pollen that spread in the wind. Female seed cones are produced annually on the tree and grow up to 20 to 30mm in diameter. They remain on the tree until the supporting branches die, typically as a result of natural fires. Individuals can live beyond 100 years, with one of the oldest individuals identified as being between 127 and 162 years old.U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. 2009. Cupressus abramsiana 5-Year Review: Summary and Evaluation. Federal Register 81: 8408-8418.  Reproduction and phenology  Close up of Santa Cruz cypress seeds. The reproductive age of the Santa Cruz cypress is on average 11 years of age. Seed viability falls to 10 percent by the time a tree is 30 years old. Like some other coniferous trees, the seed- bearing cones of the Santa Cruz cypress depend on fire to heat open the cone and release the seeds. The fires burn the vegetation in the area, including the parent tree. The seeds of the cypress are then able to germinate without the competition of other plants in the area.  Ecology  Santa Cruz Cypress natural habitat. The habitat of the Santa Cruz cypress consists of the chaparral and closed-cone pine forest communities in the Santa Cruz Mountains. The habitat ranges from 300 to 750m in elevation, consisting of poorly developed sandstone or granitic soils. IUCN 2020. The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Version 2020-1. https://www.iucnredlist.org. The climate of this area produces cool, wet winters and hot, dry summers, and natural fire regimes periodically destroy the vegetation in the area. The Santa Cruz cypress have evolved to be dependent on these fires for reproduction. The trees are obligate seeders, meaning they do not regenerate after burning up in a fire. Instead, the seeds germinate after the fire to minimal competition. They are then able to regenerate and grow the population. If fires are too frequent, seedlings will not be able to reach reproductive age. If fires are too infrequent, the trees do not reproduce often enough to maintain population size.  Distribution  This species grows only in a 16km2 (6.2mi2 or 356 acres) stretch of land in California. Within this range are five different localities with stands of the trees. The range covers parts of the Santa Cruz Mountains and the Santa Cruz and San Mateo counties. Historically, the populations had a much larger range, covering at least 76km2 (30mi2 or 19,200 acres). The estimated total population is less than 300 individuals, but abundance varies between localities. Some stands of the cypress only have a few individuals left.Farjon, A. 2013. Cupressus goveniana var. abramsiana. The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species 2013: e.T34000A2839959. https://dx.doi.org/10.2305/IUCN.UK.2013-1.RLTS.T34000A2839959.en.  Conservation status  The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) added the Santa Cruz cypress to the Red List in 1998 as endangered. In 2011, the IUCN updated the listing to critically endangered. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service added the Santa Cruz cypress to the United States' Endangered Species Act (ESA) in 1987, listing it as endangered. In 2009, a 5-year review recommended the status lower from endangered to threatened. Following petitions from local cattle and agricultural organizations and reconsideration of the review, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service reclassified the tree as threatened in 2015.  Current population threats   Alteration of fire regimes  The modern habitat of the Santa Cruz cypress no longer experiences fires at its natural frequency. Without disturbances like fire, the trees undergo little population growth and decreasing reproduction. Existing trees become post-reproductive and are no longer produce viable seeds. Human-created fires can occur too often, destroying immature trees before reaching reproductive age. The U.S. Fishing and Wildlife Service cited the altered fire regime as one of the most important threats to the populations.  Nonnative species  Nonnative species serve as competition and habitat modifiers that can limit cypress success. Acacia dealbata and Genista monspessulana impact Santa Cruz populations by blocking sunlight and by competing for soil space to germinate. More nonnative invasions are possible in the future due to the cypress‚Äô closeness to residential areas. The foot travel and human activities in these areas can bring more invasive species.  Additional threats  Another major human-derived threat to the species is climate change. Rising temperatures may push populations northwards, as well as further alter the fire regime. The species is also damaged by vandalism and unauthorized recreational activities. Actions like carving into bark damage the trees, encouraging infections and disease. In the past, the conversion of habitat into agricultural lands and residential areas was a major threat. But as populations became protected and preserved, the threat has since decreased.  Current conservation efforts  The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service released the first recovery plan for the Santa Cruz cypress in 1998. In 2009, the updated recovery plan recommended the reclassification of the species to threatened when protection for all five populations and their habitat is secured. The listed primary threats to control are logging, agricultural conversion, and development. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service lists all 356 acres of habitat as a necessary/critical habitat in conserving the species. The plan also recommends delisting the species if all five populations experience long-term reproductive success. They provide insurance against failure by the availability of stored seeds. The plan also classified the Recovery Priority Number to a 6. This is the lowest priority and represents a species with low impact on human activities. Updated resource-use plans and ordinances from the Santa Cruz and San Mateo counties currently protect some populations. More than half of all the individuals in the species occur on private lands owned by conservationists. State and county parks protect the remaining individuals. Watershed management plans have begun for some of these areas to aid in protections.

Losses from such sales are not deductible in most cases under the Internal Revenue Code in the United States. Wash sale regulations disallow an investor who holds an unrealized loss from accelerating a tax deduction into the current tax year, unless the investor is out of the position for some significant length of time. A wash sale can take place at any time during the year, or across year boundaries. In the United Kingdom, a similar practice which specifically takes place at the end of a calendar year is known as bed and breakfasting. In a bed-and-breakfasting transaction, a position is sold on the last trading day of the year (typically late in the trading session) to establish a tax loss. The same position is then repurchased early on the first session of the new trading year, to restore the position (albeit at a lower cost basis). The term, therefore, derives its name from the late sale and early morning repurchase. Wash sale rules don't apply when stock is sold at a profit. A related term, tax-loss harvesting is \\"selling an investment at a loss with the intention of ultimately repurchasing the same investment after the IRS's 30 day window on wash sales has expired.\\" This allows investors to lower their tax amount with the use of investment losses. Wash sales and similar trading patterns are not themselves prohibited; the rules only deal with the tax treatment of capital losses and the accounting of the ongoing tax basis. Tax rules in the U.S. and U.K. defer the tax benefits of wash selling at a loss. Such losses are added to the basis of the newly acquired security, essentially deferring the tax benefits until a non-wash sale occurs, if ever.  Identification  According to the Merriam-Webster Legal Dictionary, the legal definition is \\"a sale and purchase of securities that produces no change of the beneficial owner.\\" The IRS broadened its definition of wash sales in 1993. In the United States, wash sale laws are codified in \\"26 USC ¬ß 1091 - Loss from wash sales of stock or securities.\\" The corresponding treasury regulations are given by CFR 1.1091-1 and 1.1091-2. Under Section 1091, a wash sale occurs when a taxpayer sells or trades stock or securities at a loss, and within 30 days before or after the sale: # Buys substantially identical stock or securities, # Acquires substantially identical stock or securities in a fully taxable trade, # Acquires a contract or option to buy substantially identical stock or securities, or # Acquires substantially identical stock for an individual retirement account (IRA). The \\"substantially identical stock\\" acquired in any of these ways is called the \\"replacement stock\\" for that original position. The IRS has not formally defined what \\"substantially identical\\" funds are constituted of.  Consequences  In the United States, the wash sale rule has the following consequences: # The taxpayer is not allowed to claim the loss on the sale (the loss is not \\"realized\\"). # Basis Adjustment: The disallowed loss is added to the cost basis of the replacement stock. # Holding Period: The holding period for the replacement stock includes the holding period of the stock sold.IRS Publication 550 - Investment Income and Expenses - Wash Sales In the United States, reporting wash sale loss adjustments is done on the 1099-B form. According to Forbes, \\"most brokers don't report wash sale (WS) loss calculations during the year.\\" For the IRS, taxpayers in the United States must calculate their WS losses \\"across all taxpayer's brokerage accounts, including IRAs and spousal accounts if married/filing joint. Wash sale rules can also be avoided by \\"not buying a security within 30 days of selling the same one or a similar one for a loss.\\"  Basis adjustment  After a sale is identified as a wash sale and if the replacement stock is bought within 30 days before or after the sale then the wash sale loss is added to the basis of the replacement stock. The basis adjustment preserves the benefit of the disallowed loss; the holder receives that benefit on a future sale of the replacement stock. However, if the replacement shares are in a tax-advantaged account, such as an IRA, the disallowed loss cannot be added to the basis and there is no benefit for the loss. The identification of a wash sale and adjusting the basis of the replacement stock is an iterative process. Thus, the sale of the replacement stock (after its basis is adjusted) can also be identified as a wash sale if it meets the above criteria. Because of the basis adjustment in taxable accounts, the wash sale rule usually does not have a significant impact there. In most cases, it simply means the benefit will be reflected on a later report.  Holding period  When a wash sale occurs, the holding period for the replacement stock includes the period you held the stock sold.  Tax loss harvesting  Tax loss harvesting (TLH) is a technique for \\"generating\\" capital losses. It occurs when an investor sells a security that has depreciated in value.Charles Schwab: Tax Loss Harvesting CBS News describes tax-loss harvesting specifically as \\"selling an investment at a loss with the intention of ultimately repurchasing the same investment after the IRS's 30 day window on wash sales has expired.\\" This allows investors to lower their tax amount with the use of investment losses. Tax-loss harvesting can be done throughout the fiscal year, allowing investors to \\"offset capital gains with capital losses.\\" If an investor has more capital losses than gains in a year, that year they can use up to $3,000 as a deduction to \\"offset ordinary income,\\" with the remainder carrying over into future years if unused. Loss harvesting defers taxes, but doesn't eliminate them, and is essentially receiving a loan without interest from the federal government, assuming marginal tax rates are the same. If marginal rates are different, then there can be additional tax savings (e.g., deducting excess losses against a higher ordinary income rate in one year in exchange for additional long term capital gains tax at a lower rate in a later year) or even a tax penalty (e.g., deducting at a lower capital gains tax rate in several years in exchange for a much larger gain in one later year that puts one in a higher capital gains tax and Medicare investment income tax bracket.) Most simply, if \\"tax-loss harvesting is not done properly, it will create a wash-sale that will eliminate the tax benefits of the buying and selling.\\" The investor can employ a number of techniques to avoid triggering the wash sale rule. # The investor can wait 30 days to repurchase the security # The investor can purchase a security that is similar to the original, but that does not meet the IRS's definition of \\"substantially identical\\". For example, an investor can sell an ETF and buy another with similar investment objectives.Wealthfront: Tax Loss Harvesting Most tax-loss harvesting historically has been performed in December. Tax-loss harvesting is still most common in the year's fourth quarter. The practice has been both praised and criticized by investors, as deferring the taxes can result in higher rates later on relating to capital gains.  Investment companies  The IRS has published no exact definition of what constitutes a \\"substantially identical\\" security. Therefore, it is not clear whether or not the securities of different investment companies can be \\"substantially identical\\", even if their investment objectives are identical. As a result, if an investor trades in and out of ETF's or mutual funds with almost identical holdings, some have held that it does not trigger the wash sale rule.Tax Rules for ETF Losses Fidelity.comSubstantially Identical Security Investopedia For example, State Street's SPDR S&P; 500 ETF (NYSEARCA: SPY)State Street SPDR S&P; 500 ETF and iShare's Core S&P; 500 ETF (NYSEARCA: IVV)iShares Core S&P; 500 ETF both track the S&P; 500\\\\. If an investor purchases shares in SPY and the market price declines, the IRS has not provided guidance on whether the investor can sell their shares in SPY, purchase shares in IVV, and claim a capital loss without triggering the wash sale rule, despite the fact that the two ETF's have nearly identical returns.  Methods of optimal tax loss harvesting  = Mean-variance portfolio optimization = With an initial set of portfolio weights w_{0} and benchmark weights w_{B} , it is possible to do TLH within the confines of mean-variance optimization by developing an objective function that maximizes the difference between tax alpha and the portfolio's tracking error:\\\\max_{w} \\\\; \\\\underbrace{\\\\alpha^{T}(w-w_{0})}_{\\\\text{Tax Alpha}} - \\\\underbrace{{\\\\lambda\\\\over{2}}(w-w_{B})^{T}\\\\Sigma (w-w_{B})}_{\\\\text{Tracking Error}} where \\\\lambda is a penalty term for excess tracking error and \\\\Sigma is the covariance matrix of asset returns. For each asset that is bought/sold, it is necessary to include the constraints:\\\\begin{cases} w_{j} \\\\geq w_{0,j}, \\\\quad &(\\\\text{Buy Trades}) \\\\\\\\\\\\ w_{j} \\\\leq w_{0,j}, \\\\quad &(\\\\text{Sell Trades}) \\\\end{cases} With this formulation, the TLH optimization may be applied within a mean-variance framework. The solution is readily computed using quadratic programming.

Libocedrus decurrens Torr.), is a species of conifer native to western North America. It is the most widely known species in the genus, and is often simply called 'incense cedar' without the regional qualifier.Farjon, A. (2005). Monograph of Cupressaceae and Sciadopitys. Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew.  Description  Calocedrus decurrens is a large tree, typically reaching heights of and a trunk diameter of up to . The largest known tree, located in Klamath National Forest, Siskiyou County, California, is tall with a circumference trunk and a spread. It has a broad conic crown of spreading branches. The bark is orange-brown weathering grayish, smooth at first, becoming fissured and exfoliating in long strips on the lower trunk on old trees. The foliage is produced in flattened sprays with scale-like leaves long; they are arranged in opposite decussate pairs, with the successive pairs closely then distantly spaced, so forming apparent whorls of four; the facial pairs are flat, with the lateral pairs folded over their bases. The leaves are bright green on both sides of the shoots with only inconspicuous stomata. The foliage, when crushed, gives off an aroma somewhat akin to shoe-polish. The seed cones are long, pale green to yellow, with four (rarely six) scales arranged in opposite decussate pairs; the outer pair of scales each bears two winged seeds, the inner pair(s) usually being sterile and fused together in a flat plate. The cones turn orange to yellow-brown when mature about 8 months after pollination. The pollen cones are long. Distribution The bulk of the range is in the United States, from central western Oregon through most of California and the extreme west of Nevada, and also a short distance into northwest Mexico in northern Baja California. It grows at altitudes of  Ecology  This tree is the preferred host of a wood wasp, Syntexis libocedrii a species which lays its eggs in the smoldering wood immediately after a forest fire. The tree is also host to incense-cedar mistletoe (Phoradendron libocedri), a parasitic plant which can often be found hanging from its branches. The incense cedar is one of the most fire and drought tolerant plants in California. Although the tree is killed by hot, stand-replacing crown fire, it spreads rapidly after lower intensity burns.Franklin, Janet; Spears-Lebrun, Linnea A.; Deutschman, Douglas H.; Marsden, Kim. 2006. Impact of a high-intensity fire on mixed evergreen and mixed conifer forests in the Peninsular Ranges of southern California, USA. Forest Ecology and Management. 235(1-3): 18-29. [65016] This has given the incense cedar a competitive advantage over other species such as the bigcone Douglas-fir in recent years.  Uses  The wood is the primary material for wooden pencils, because it is soft and tends to sharpen easily without forming splinters.  Native Americans  The Native Americans of California used the plant in traditional medicine, basket making, hunting bows, building materials, and to produce fire by friction.University of Michigan‚ÄîDearborn: Native American Ethnobotany of Calocedrus decurrens The Maidu Concow tribe name for the plant is h√∂'-t√§ (Konkow language).  Cultivation  Calocedrus decurrens is cultivated by plant nurseries as an ornamental tree, for planting in gardens and parks. It is used in traditional, xeriscapic, native plant, and wildlife gardens; and used in designed natural landscaping and habitat restoration projects in California. It is valued for its columnar form and evergreen foliage textures. The tree is also grown in gardens and parks in cool summer climates, including the Pacific Northwest in the Northwestern United States and British Columbia, eastern Great Britain and continental Northern Europe. In these areas it can develop an especially narrow columnar crown, an unexplained consequence of the cooler climatic conditions that is rare in trees within its warm summer natural range in the California Floristic Province. Other cultivated species from the family Cupressaceae can have similar crown forms.Mitchell, A. F. (1996). Alan Mitchell's Trees of Britain. Collins .

The Big Apple (also known as New York City) is an action game written by Russ Segal for the Atari 8-bit family and published by Synapse Software in 1984. Segal previously wrote Picnic Paranoia for Synapse. New York City was ported to the Commodore 64 by Greg Nelson. As part of a \\"Double Play\\" promotion, New York City was sold as part of a two-game combo, with Electrician on the other side of the disk. Gameplay The gameplay involves visiting tourist destinations of New York City such as Grant's Tomb and the U.N. building, as well as less important locations such as the automat and bank. Each location consists of a mini-game, accessed by walking, driving or taking the subway in a stylised rendition of Manhattan island. The game begins in a parking lot somewhere inside a randomly generated city. The player is given a car to drive along the city streets and avoid the other traffic as long as they have gas to spare. If they run out of gas or crash, a tow truck will deliver the vehicle back to the parking lot, and the player must walk from then on. If the player gets run over by a vehicle they are transported to the hospital. Minigames include the subway, where a token must be collected before boarding the train; the Central Park Zoo, where animals must be rounded up; and the automat, where food must be collected before other diners. A clock prompts the player when to search for food and when go on with the next mission. The clock runs from 9am to 5pm, and the goal is to survive New York City for seven days.

Overview Most handgun projectiles have significantly lower energy than centerfire rifles and shotguns. What they lack in power, they make up for it in light weight, small size, concealability and practicality. The lack of power they possess, and caliber/bullet effectiveness, are widely debated topics with growing experimental research among civilians, law enforcement agencies, militaries, and ammunition companies. Factors that can influence handgun effectiveness include handgun design, bullet type, and bullet capabilities (e.g. wound mechanisms, penetration, velocity, and weight).  Factors   Cavitation  Most handgun projectiles wound primarily through the size of the hole they produce. This hole is known as a permanent cavity. For comparison, rifles wound through temporary cavitation as well as permanent cavitation. A temporary cavity is also known as a stretch cavity. This is because it acts to stretch the permanent cavity, increasing the wounding potential. The potential for wounding via temporary cavity depends on the elasticity of the tissue, bullet fragmentation, and the rate of energy transfer. Many handgun bullets do not create significant wounding via temporary cavitation, but the potential is there if the bullet fragments, strikes inelastic tissue (liver, spleen, kidneys, CNS), or if the bullet transfers over of energy per foot of penetration. These phenomena are unrelated to low-pressure cavitation in liquids.  Penetration  There are many factors used to measure a handgun's effectiveness. One of them is penetration. The FBI's requirement for all service rounds is penetration in calibrated ballistic gelatin. This generally ensures a bullet will reach the vital organs from most angles. Penetration is arguably the most important factor in handgun wounding potential, because the vital areas must be destroyed or damaged to incapacitate.  Ballistic Pressure Wave/Hydrostatic Shock  There is a significant body of evidence that Hydrostatic shock (more precisely known as the ballistic pressure wave) can contribute to handgun bullet effectiveness. Recent work published by scientists M Courtney and A Courtney provides compelling support for the role of a ballistic pressure wave in incapacitation and injury. This work builds upon the earlier works of Suneson et al. where the researchers implanted high-speed pressure transducers into the brain of pigs and demonstrated that a significant pressure wave reaches the brain of pigs shot in the thigh. These scientists observed neural damage in the brain caused by the distant effects of the ballistic pressure wave originating in the thigh. The results of Suneson et al. were confirmed and expanded upon by a later experiment in dogs which \\"confirmed that distant effect exists in the central nervous system after a high-energy missile impact to an extremity. A high-frequency oscillating pressure wave with large amplitude and short duration was found in the brain after the extremity impact of a high-energy missile ...\\" Wang et al. observed significant damage in both the hypothalamus and hippocampus regions of the brain due to remote effects of the ballistic pressure wave.  Caliber  Another factor is expansion and caliber. Many civilians and practically all law enforcement agencies use jacketed hollow point or some form of expanding ammunition. This increases the chance of a handgun bullet striking a vital organ, and increases blood loss. Because of this, two different calibers could theoretically produce almost identical incapacitation results, provided the two penetrate the same area, and the small caliber expands to the size of the larger. It is generally agreed that most intermediate handgun calibers will perform similarly, since their wounding principles are the same. A list of many handgun calibers can be found at List of handgun cartridges.  One-shot stops  The only scientifically proven and biologically possible way to guarantee instant incapacitation is through destruction of the central nervous system or brain. This will usually cease all motor-related and voluntary actions. If the central nervous system is not damaged or destroyed, there will be no immediate incapacitation. To allow room for error, since a central nervous system hit is very unlikely, most people use expanding ammunition. This will increase the odds of striking a part of the central nervous system, and cause faster blood loss. For example, a popular caliber in the United States is the .45 ACP. It is the largest practical handgun caliber in use, featuring a bullet that is in diameter. With well made expanding ammunition, a .452 bullet often expands to .70 caliber or larger. With a 9 mm Luger bullet, for example, its normal .355 diameter might be hoped to expand to .50 caliber or larger. This could give a preference for larger caliber bullets, as they do not rely on expansion as much as smaller caliber bullets do to provide incapacitation. However, multiple tests and actual data from shootings have not found this to be true. The most popular round in the United States is the 9 mm Luger. The variety of handguns and ammunition available for this round is much higher than any other caliber. The amount of energy delivered to a body is dependent on both the weight of the bullet and its velocity as basic physics dictates. Thus NATO prefers the 9 mm Luger parabellum to a larger but slower round such as the .45 ACP. Bullet expansion in handguns is desirable not solely for incapacitation, but also so the bullet will not exit the target. An expanding bullet will stop in the target and \\"dump\\" all its energy there, rather than overpenetrating and possibly endangering people behind the target. Since all handgun rounds are marginal at best, the one with the most energy and which expends all that energy in a target is the one that is most effective.

It serves as a connector between NY 32 in the town of Saugerties and NY 23A in the town of Catskill. The road allows traffic from the Saugerties area, particularly from the New York State Thruway, to directly reach the interior of the Greene County portion of Catskill Park. The majority of traffic is tourism-oriented, from hikers in summer to skiers bound for Hunter Mountain in winter. If NY 32A did not exist, drivers would have to go several miles out of their way to the intersection of NY 32 and NY 23A. Route description NY 32A northbound approaching NY 23A in Palenville NY 32A forks off to the west-northwest from NY 32 at a junction in the Ulster County town of Saugerties, seven miles (11 km) southwest of New York State Thruway exit 20\\\\. The two-lane route runs on level ground, although the Catskill Escarpment looms to the west from many open areas. Heading away from NY 32, the first mile (1.6 km) of the route traverses mostly wooded areas, although there are some open fields near the NY 32 intersection. The road soon begins to run along the south side of Kaaterskill Creek, and NY 32A follows the stream across the nearby Ulster‚ÄìGreene county line and into the hamlet of Palenville. In Palenville, the highway initially serves a handful of scattered homes on the south bank of Kaaterskill Creek. After several blocks, NY 32A briefly turns northward to cross the creek and reach Palenville's small central business district. Here, the route passes Palenville's fire department before ending at a signalized intersection with NY 23A across from the National Register of Historic Places-listed Rowena Memorial School. The junction lies just east of the Catskill Park Blue Line and NY 23A's long climb up Kaaterskill Clove toward the Catskill High Peaks. History The origins of NY 32A date back to the 1920s when the highway was acquired by the state of New York and first improved to state highway standards. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, the road became part of the new NY 32, which initially had a gap in the route between Palenville and Cairo. The gap was filled in the early 1940s by a new highway extending from Cairo to a point southeast of Palenville. NY 32 was realigned to bypass Palenville on the new road while its former routing into the hamlet was redesignated as NY 32A.

Pleymo has sold over 100,000 albums to date. The band's name apparently originates from the lead singer once having a haircut as a child that was similar to that of Playmobil figures.  History   Beginning and Ke√ßkispasse? (1997‚Äì1999)  Pleymo started in 1997 under the name of \\"Pleymobill\\", but the name was eventually shortened to the name they have now when the band's lineup expanded to five due to the inclusion of turntablist DJ Frank (Frank Bailleul). The same year, Mathias, the guitarist at the time, exited the band and Erik De Villoutreys eventually replaced Mattias as the guitarist. Little by little the group was growing and then caught the attention of the producer St√©phane Kraemer. On June 15, 1999 they released their first album called Ke√ßkispasse? signed to the label Wet Music. Epic (a branch of Sony) offered the band a record deal in 2000.  Episode 2 : Medecine Cake (2002)  In 2002, they released Episode 2: Medecine Cake, produced by Fabrice Leyni. Sales of Pleymo's second album topped the 50,000 mark, establishing the band as a major new French band. In August 2002, Pleymo went on to perform at the Summer Sonic Festival in Tokyo and also in Osaka, sharing the stage with major international stars such as The Offspring and No Doubt. With this, they were already well known in Belgium, Luxembourg, Switzerland, UK and also Japan (where they played a lot of concerts in 2002 and 2004). They also released an English version of this album, called Doctor Tank's Medicine Cake, with English lyrics. In November 2002 the group released a six-track \\"(Ep)Live\\", recorded at Les Eurock√©ennes festival in Belfort.  Rock (2003-2004)  Their third album title, Rock, announced a major change of musical direction, with greater emphasis on melody and vocals. The members of the group stated that this third album was influenced by the work of bands like Pink Floyd and The Smashing Pumpkins. Rock is a concept album about a blind four-year-old boy and his imaginary double. Sales of Rock topped the 50,000 mark in France and 18,000 in Japan. Pleymo were nominated in the \\"Best Pop/Rock Album of the Year\\" category at the \\"Victoires de la musique\\" Awards. Some of the band's older fans felt alienated at the perceived change in direction and sound. In September 2004 recorded a duet with teen pop'n'rock idols Kyo, resulting in the single \\"On ne changera rien\\".  Alphabet Prison and hiatus (2005-2007)  On October 9, 2006, they returned with Alphabet Prison, an album that englobes all that they've done until that date, that have slower and calm songs (Un parfum nomm√© 16 ans) and heavier songs (Z√©phyr, Blockout). In 2007, they announced that they're going on hiatus. Mark confirmed that in a concert. Mark is going to Los Angeles, where he's going to film a movie. Franck will go to the EUA to promote his brand Kill. Beno√Æt is going to play in a new group called Empyr, that have members from Watcha, Vegastar and the ancient singer of Kyo. Fred also is going to play in a new group called Hewitt. Davy will continue in the group Enhancer and Lula Fortune And Eric hasn't announced any project. In 2008, the song \\"New Wave\\" from Medecine Cake was released as a downloadable track for the game Rock Band.  Reunion (2017-present)  On March 29, 2017, Pleymo announced their comeback. The first reunion show occurred on March 9, 2018 in their native France.  Influences  Their influences range from Rage Against the Machine to bands like Korn, Deftones and Primus.

The beach separates the Bhitarkanika Mangroves from the Bay of Bengal and is the world's most important nesting beach for olive ridley sea turtles. The beach is part of Gahirmatha Marine Wildlife Sanctuary, which also includes the adjacent portion of the Bay of Bengal. Know it better Odisha coast has the world's largest known rookery of olive ridley sea turtle. Apart from Gahirmatha rookery, two other masses are there where nesting beaches have been located which are at the mouth of rivers Rushikulya and Devi. The spectacular site of the mass congregation of olive ridley sea turtles for mating and nesting enthralls both the scientists and the nature lovers throughout the world. An event that took place in April 2017 validates this phenomenon. In this month, it was reported by forest officials that at least two lakh (200,000) baby olive ridley turtles have come out of their pits within a span of 24 hours. This news was received well by conservation societies and wildlife lovers. Events like these are expected to last at least a week at the Gahirmatha Beach. That rarity of mass congregation and the cruelty meted out to these innocent marine creatures, paved the way for declaration of the stretch of water body from old lighthouse near Batighar to Maipura river mouth as Gahirmatha (Marine) Wildlife Sanctuary. Location Gahirmatha is the only marine wildlife sanctuary of Odisha. This was notified as such in Government of Odisha, Forest & Environment Department Notification No. 18805/ F&E; dated 27 September 1997 and published in the Odisha Gazette, extraordinary No. 1268 dated 17 October 1997. It is located between 86 degrees 45' 57\\" to 87 degrees 17' 36\\"- east longitude and 20 degree 17' 32\\" to 20 degree 45'58\\" - north latitude. The total area of the sanctuary is 1435.0 km2 which includes 1408.0 km2 of the water body and 27.0 km2 of land mass including reserve forests, mud flats, and accreted sandbars. The core area of the sanctuary consists of 725.50 km2 and the buffer zone accounts for 709.50 km2. The entire sanctuary area comes within the revenue district of Kendrapara. Importance Olive ridley sea turtles migrate in huge numbers from the beginning of November, every year, for mating and nesting along the coast of Odisha. Gahirmatha coast has the annual nesting figure between one hundred to five hundred thousand, each year. there has been decline in the population of these turtles in the recent past due to mass mortality. Olive ridley sea turtle has found place in Schedule - I of Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972 (amended 1991). All the species of sea turtles in the coastal water of Odisha are listed as \\"vulnerable\\" as per IUCN Red Data Book. The sea turtles are protected under the 'Migratory Species Convention' and CITES (Convention of International Trade on Wildlife Flora and Fauna). India is a signatory nation to all these conventions. The 'Homing' characteristics of the ridley sea turtles make them more prone to mass casualty. The voyage to the natal nesting beaches is the dooming factor for the sea turtles. Since Gahirmatha coast serves as the natal nesting beach for millions of turtles, it has immense importance on turtle conservation. Source:http://iucnredlist.org/details/11534/0 Food habits Olive ridley sea turtles feed on marine snails, smaller forms of fish, fish eggs, crustaceans, and jellyfish. The algal material is also used as food by the ridleys. Ridleys generally crush and grind the food materials before intaking. Migration The best feeding ground of sea turtles may not be the best nesting ground for them. The sea turtles migrate thousands of kilometers to meet both the ends. It has been observed that olive ridley sea turtles migrate from the coastal water of Sri Lanka in the Indian Ocean to the coastal water of Gahirmatha in the north. The 'Homing' characteristics and the uncanny ability to orient itself in open sea help the sea turtles to migrate over long distance without getting lost in the vastness of the sea. Mating immediately after the arrival of ridley sea turtles in the coastal water of Gahirmatha, they indulge in mating activities. Males mount over the females and are often seen floating on the surface with the intermittent movement of flippers. Sometimes more than one male is seen mounting over one female. The courtship continues for hours unless there is any external threat. A female will continue to mate with several males throughout the breeding season. Mostly the mating pairs are seen off the coast of Ekakula. Nesting The mass nesting behavior of olive ridley sea turtles is known as \\"Arribada\\". Thousands of female carrying turtles scramble on the nesting beach at Nasi - I & II islands to release the eggs in flask-shaped cavities. The turtles scoop the soft sand to a depth of 45 cm with the help of flippers and release 100 to 180 eggs. Before scampering on to the beach, the turtles survey the nesting ground from the sea and in case they smell and danger, they shun the beach and search for safer breeding ground. The urge to release the egg is so intense that they are so oblivious of the presence of any foreigner, at the time of nesting. Generally, dark nights are preferred by the ridleys for nesting. It has been observed that nesting takes place once the southerly wind starts blowing. The period of emergence and retreat into the sea after nesting takes 45 to 55 minutes. Due to the shrinkage of the nesting beach, overcrowding of turtles is observed during nesting. The eggs which are scooped out by successive nesters is known as \\"doomed\\" egg as it would never be able to hatch. Sporadic nesting is also not uncommon. These eggs are mostly damaged by predators. The nesting females emit hissing noise at the time of laying eggs as the intake of oxygen is maximum at that moment. After laying eggs, the female turtle fills up the pit with sand by the flippers and tries to camouflage the pit site. The mother turtle rams the pit with the help of its body weight. Hatching The eggs inside the flask-shaped pits, being incubated by the sun and the metabolic heat, hatch after 50 to 60 days. The hatching takes place during the night or in the predawn period to avoid predation by jackals, dogs, and birds. The walls of the pit gradually collapse, thereby allowing the eggs on the lower strata to rise upwards. After the emergence of hatchlings, they immediately head for the open sea. The tiny replicas of turtles are in a frenzy to enter the sea water. This is the most spectacular sight. The hatchlings orient themselves by the reflection of stars on seawater or by the brighter horizon and head en masse towards the sea. The hatchlings swim deep into the sea until they reach the sea current. During this period large-scale mortality of hatchlings take place. It is studied that 1 in 1000 survives. Bigger fishes, ghost crabs or seagulls either predates the hatchlings. Then the period of \\"lost year\\" begins.

It belongs to the genus Asimina in the same plant family (the Annonaceae) as the custard- apple, cherimoya, sweetsop, ylang-ylang, and soursop. The pawpaw is a patch- forming (clonal) understory tree found in well-drained, deep, fertile bottomland and hilly upland habitat, with large, simple leaves. Pawpaw fruits are the largest edible fruit indigenous to the United States (not counting gourds, which are typically considered vegetables rather than fruit for culinary purposes, although in botany they are classified as fruit). Pawpaw fruits have a sweet, custardish flavor somewhat similar to banana, mango, and pineapple, and are commonly eaten raw, but are also used to make ice cream and baked desserts. The bark, leaves, and fruit have been documented as containing the neurotoxin annonacin, which could cause neurodegeneration. Names This plant's scientific name is Asimina triloba. The genus name Asimina is adapted from the Native American (probably Miami-Illinois) name assimin or rassimin through the French colonial asiminier. The specific epithet triloba in the species' scientific name refers to the flowers' three-lobed calices and doubly three-lobed corollas, the shape not unlike a tricorne hat. The common name of this species is variously spelled pawpaw, paw paw, paw-paw, and papaw. It probably derives from the Spanish papaya, an American tropical and subtropical fruit (Carica papaya) sometimes also called \\"papaw\\", perhaps because of the superficial similarity of their fruits and the fact that both have very large leaves. The name pawpaw or papaw, first recorded in print in English in 1598, originally meant the giant herb Carica papaya or its fruit (as it still commonly does in many English-speaking communities, including Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa). Daniel F. Austin's Florida EthnobotanyCRC Press, 2004, p.122. states that: > The original \\"papaw\\" ... is Carica papaya. By 1598, English-speaking people > in the Caribbean were calling these plants \\"pawpaws\\" or \\"papaws\\" ... [yet > later, when English-speakers settled in] the temperate Americas, they found > another tree with a similarly aromatic, sweet fruit. It reminded them of the > \\"papaya\\", which had already become \\"papaw\\", so that is what they called > these different plants ... By 1760, the names \\"papaw\\" and \\"pawpaw\\" were > being applied to A. triloba. Yet A. triloba has had numerous local common names, many of which compare it to a banana rather than to pawpaw or papaya (i.e. to Carica papaya). These include: wild banana, prairie banana, Indiana banana, Hoosier banana, West Virginia banana, Kansas banana, Kentucky banana, Michigan banana, Missouri banana, Appalachian banana, Ozark banana, Indian banana, American custard apple, banango, and the poor man's banana, as well as asimoya, Quaker delight and hillbilly mango. Several tribes of Native Americans have terms for the pawpaw such as riwah√°rikstikuc (Pawnee), t√≥zha‚Åø hu (Kansa), and umbi (Choctaw). Description Paw paw blossom Paw paw blossoms A. triloba is a large shrub or small tree growing to a height of , rarely as tall as , with trunks or more in diameter. The large leaves of pawpaw trees are clustered symmetrically at the ends of the branches, giving a distinctive imbricated appearance to the tree's foliage. The leaves of the species are simple, alternate and spirally arranged, entire, deciduous, obovate-lanceolate, long, broad, and wedge-shaped at the base, with an acute apex and an entire margin, with the midrib and primary veins prominent. The petioles are short and stout, with a prominent adaxial groove. Stipules are lacking. The expanding leaves are conduplicate, green, covered with rusty tomentum beneath, and hairy above; when fully grown they are smooth, dark green above, and paler beneath. When bruised, the leaves have a disagreeable odor similar to a green bell pepper. In autumn, the leaves are a rusty yellow, allowing pawpaw groves to be spotted from a long distance. Pawpaw flowers are perfect, about across, rich red- purple or maroon when mature, with three sepals and six petals. They are borne singly on stout, hairy, axillary peduncles. The flowers are produced in early spring at the same time as or slightly before the new leaves appear, and have a faint fetid or yeasty smell. Fruit The fruit of the pawpaw is a large, yellowish-green to brown berry, long and broad, weighing from , containing several brown or black seeds in diameter embedded in the soft, edible fruit pulp. The conspicuous fruits begin developing after the plants flower; they are initially green, maturing by September or October to yellow or brown. When mature, the heavy fruits bend the weak branches down. Other characteristics: * Calyx: Sepals three, valvate in bud, ovate, acuminate, pale green, downy * Corolla: Petals six, in two rows, imbricate in the bud; inner row acute, erect, nectariferous; outer row broadly ovate, reflexed at maturity; petals at first are green, then brown, and finally become dull purple or maroon and conspicuously veiny * Stamens: Indefinite, densely packed on the globular receptacle; filaments short; anthers extrorse, two-celled, opening longitudinally * Pollen: Shed as permanent tetradsWalker JW (1971) Pollen Morphology, Phytogeography, and Phylogeny of the Annonaceae. Contributions from the Gray Herbarium of Harvard University, 202: 1-130. * Pistils: Several, on the summit of the receptacle, projecting from the mass of stamens; ovary one-celled; stigma sessile; ovules many * Branchlets: Light brown, tinged with red, marked by shallow grooves * Winter buds: Small, of two kinds, the leaf buds pointed and closely appressed to the twigs, and the flower buds round, brown, and fuzzy * Bark: Light gray, sometimes blotched with lighter gray spots, sometimes covered with small excrescences, divided by shallow fissures; inner bark tough, fibrous; bark with a very disagreeable odor when bruised * Wood: Pale, greenish yellow, sapwood lighter; light, soft, coarse-grained and spongy with a specific gravity of 0.3969 and a density of * Longevity of fruit production: Undetermined  Range and ecology  Bark The pawpaw is native to the Eastern, Southern, and Midwestern United States and adjacent Ontario, Canada, from New York west to southeastern Nebraska, and south to northern Florida and eastern Texas. The tree commonly grows in floodplains and shady, rich bottomlands, where it often forms a dense, clonally spreading undergrowth in the forest, often appearing as a patch or thicket of individual, small, slender trees. Pawpaws are not the first to colonize a disturbed site (arriving roughly four years after a clearcut), but may become dominant and slow the establishment of oaks and hickories. Although shade- tolerant, pawpaws do not persist in undisturbed old growth forest. Pawpaws spread locally primarily by root suckers; sexual reproduction by seed does also occur, but at a fairly low rate. Pawpaw flowers are insect-pollinated, but fruit production is sometimes limited as few if any pollinators are attracted to the flower's faint, or sometimes nonexistent scent. The flowers produce an odor similar to that of rotting meat to attract blowflies or carrion beetles for cross-pollination. Other insects that are attracted to pawpaw flowers include scavenging fruit flies, carrion flies, and beetles. Because of irregular fruit production, some believe pawpaw plants are self- incompatible, requiring cross-pollination between trees of different clones (patches). The fruits of the pawpaw are eaten by a variety of mammals, including raccoons, gray foxes, opossums, squirrels, and black bears.Asimina triloba , Fire Effects Information System, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station, Fire Sciences Laboratory The disagreeable-smelling leaves, twigs, and bark of pawpaws contain natural insecticides known as acetogenins.B. J. Sampson, J. L. McLaughlin, D. E. Wedge. 2003. PawPaw Extract as a Botanical Insecticide, 2002. Arthropod Management Tests, vol.28, p. L. Pawpaw leaves and twigs are seldom consumed by rabbits, deer, or goats, or by many insects. However, mules have been seen eating pawpaw leaves in Maryland. Larvae of the zebra swallowtail (Protographium marcellus), a butterfly, feed exclusively on young leaves of A. triloba and various other pawpaw (Asimina) species, but never occur in great numbers on the plants. Chemicals in the pawpaw leaves confer protection from predation throughout the butterflies' lives, as trace amounts of acetogenins remain present, making them unpalatable to birds and other predators. Conservation status On a global (range-wide) scale, the common pawpaw (A. triloba) has a NatureServe global conservation rank of G5 (very common). In the United States, the species has an N5 (very common), but is considered a threatened species in New York, and an endangered species in New Jersey. In Canada, where the species is found only in portions of southern Ontario, it has a rank of N3 (vulnerable), and a NatureServe subnational conservation rank of S3 (vulnerable) in Ontario. The Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources has given the species a general status of \\"Sensitive\\", and its populations there are monitored. In areas in which deer populations are dense, pawpaws appear to be becoming more abundant locally, since the deer avoid them, but consume seedlings of most other woody plants. History The natural distribution of the common pawpaw in North America, prior to the ice ages and lasting until roughly 10,000 years ago, was done by certain megafauna until they became extinct during the Quaternary extinction event. After the arrival of humans and the subsequent extinction of megafauna that were distributing A. triloba, the probable distribution of these large fruit-bearing plants has been by humans. The earliest documented mention of pawpaws is in the 1541 report of the Spanish de Soto expedition, who found Native Americans cultivating it east of the Mississippi River. The Lewis and Clark Expedition consumed pawpaws during their travels. Thomas Jefferson planted it at Monticello, his home in Virginia. Legend has it that chilled pawpaw fruit was a favorite dessert of George Washington. Research Kentucky State University (KSU) has the only full-time pawpaw research program in the world; it was started in 1990 with the aim of developing pawpaw as a new tree-fruit crop for Kentucky. Pawpaw is the largest native fruit in North America and has very few diseases compared to other orchard crops. KSU is the site of the USDA National Clonal Germplasm Repository for Asimina species and the pawpaw orchards at KSU contain over 1,700 trees. Research activities include germplasm collection and variety trials, and efforts are directed towards improving propagation, understanding fruit ripening and storage, and developing orchard management practices. Cultivation is best in hardiness zones 5-9 and trees take 7-8 years from seedling to fruiting. KYSU has created the three cultivars KSU-'Atwood', KSU-'Benson', and KSU-'Chappell', with foci on better flavors, higher yields, vigorous plants, and low seed-to-pulp ratios. Cultivation Asimina triloba flower showing pollinatorsIn cultivation, lack of successful pollination is the most common cause of poor fruiting. Cultivation is best in hardiness zones 5-9 and trees take 7-8 years from seedling to fruiting. Cross-pollination of at least two different genetic varieties of the plant is recommended, and growers often resort to hand pollination or to use of pollinator attractants such as spraying fish emulsion or hanging chicken necks or other meat near the open flowers to attract pollinators. While pawpaws are larval hosts for the zebra swallowtail butterfly, these caterpillars are usually present only at low density, and not detrimental to the foliage of the trees. Pawpaws have never been cultivated for their fruits on the scale of apples or peaches, primarily because pawpaw fruits ripen to the point of fermentation soon after they are picked, and only frozen fruit stores or ships well. Other methods of preservation include dehydration, production of jams or jellies, and pressure canning (using the numerical values for bananas). Cultivation of pawpaws for fruit production has attracted interest, particularly among organic growers, as a fruit with few to no pests that can successfully be grown in its native environment without pesticides. The commercial cultivation and harvesting of pawpaws is strong in southeastern Ohio and also being explored in Kentucky and Maryland, as well as various areas outside the species' native range, including California, the Pacific Northwest, and Massachusetts. The pawpaw is also gaining in popularity among landscapers and backyard gardeners because of the tree's distinctive growth habit, the appeal of its fresh fruit, and its relatively low maintenance needs once established. Propagation A young, pot-grown A. triloba tree sprouting from the soil, showing the large, heavy seed being lifted by the young stem Trees are easily grown from seed. It is easiest to simply plant an entire fruit in the ground or place a seed in the ground immediately upon eating the fruit. Seeds should not be dried out, as they lose viability if they dehydrate to 5% moisture. The seeds need to be stratified by moist cold storage for 60-100 days at (some publications suggest 90-120 days). They will lose their viability if stored for 3 years or more; some seeds survive if stored for 2 years. Germination is hypogeal and cotyledons remain within the seed coat. Strictly speaking, hypogeal means the cotyledons stay in the soil, acting as a food store for the seedling until the plumule emerges from the soil on the epicotyl or true stem. However, pawpaw seeds have occasionally been observed to emerge from the ground and form the true stem and plumule above ground. Propagation using cuttings has generally not been successful. Desirable cultivars are propagated by chip budding or whip grafting onto a root stock. Pawpaw seeds do not grow \\"true to type\\" ‚Äî each individual seed in a fruit is genetically different from the others and from its parent tree. Purchased cultivars do not produce seeds true to type, either, which is why cultivars are all grafted trees. Root sucker seedlings, however, are all genetically identical to their host. Commercial nurseries usually ship seedlings in containers, usually grafted cultivars, but other nurseries such as the Kentucky Division of Forestry ship bareroot seedlings for reforestation projects and area homeowners. Harvesting seedlings from the forest floor is tricky because most forest-floor seedlings are actually root suckers with few roots, and those seedlings that did grow from a seed have deep taproots. Blowflies, such as C. vomitoria, are known pollinators of these plants.  Cultivars  Over the years, many cultivars of A. triloba have been developed or discovered. Many have been lost and are no longer available commercially. The named varieties producing large fruit and performing well in Kentucky per research trials are 'NC-1', 'Overleese', 'Potomac', 'Shenandoah', 'Sunflower', 'Susquehanna', 'Wabash', KSU-'Atwood', KSU-'Benson', and KSY-'Chappell'. Habitat restoration Pawpaws are sometimes included in ecological restoration plantings, since this tree grows well in wet soil and has a strong tendency to form well-rooted colonial thickets. Uses A. triloba is often called wild banana, Indiana banana, or prairie banana because of its banana-like creamy texture and flavor. Fruits As described by horticulturist Barbara Damrosch, the fruit of the pawpaw \\"looks a bit like mango, but with pale yellow, custardy, spoonable flesh and black, easy-to- remove seeds.\\" Wild-collected pawpaw fruits, ripe in late August to mid- September, have long been a favorite treat throughout the tree's extensive native range in eastern North America, and on occasion are sold locally at farmers' markets. Pawpaw fruits have a sweet, custard-like flavor somewhat similar to banana, mango, and cantaloupe, varying significantly by source or cultivar, with more protein than most fruits. Nineteenth-century American agronomist E. Lewis Sturtevant described pawpaws as > ... a natural custard, too luscious for the relish of most people Ohio botanist William B. Werthner noted that > The fruit ... has a tangy wild-wood flavor peculiarly its own. It is sweet, > yet rather cloying to the taste and a wee bit puckery Fresh fruits of the pawpaw are commonly eaten raw, either chilled or at room temperature. However, they can be kept only 2‚Äì3 days at room temperature, or about a week if refrigerated. The easily bruised pawpaw fruits do not ship well unless frozen. Where pawpaws grow, the fruit pulp is also often used locally in baked dessert recipes, with pawpaw often substituted with volumetric equivalency in many banana-based recipes. Pawpaws may also be blended into ice cream or included in pancakes. =Nutrition= According to a report from the KSU Pawpaw Program (right table), raw pawpaw (with skin) in a 100-g amount provides 80 Calories and is a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of vitamin C (22% DV), magnesium (32% DV), iron (54% DV), and manganese (124% DV). The fruit also contains a moderate amount (119% DV) of vitamin A.  Phytochemicals  Zebra swallowtail butterflies (Eurytides marcellus) with pawpaw foliage Phytochemical extracts of the leaves and fruit contain acetogenins, including the neurotoxin annonacin. The seeds and bark contain the chemical asimitrin and other acetogenins, including asimin, asiminacin and asiminecin. Effect on insects Due to the presence of acetogenins, the leaves, twigs, and bark of pawpaw trees can be used to make an organic insecticide. The one notable exception is the zebra swallowtail butterfly (Eurytides marcellus), whose larvae feed on the leaves of various species of Asimina, conferring protection from predation throughout the butterflies' lives, as trace amounts of acetogenins remain present, making them unpalatable to birds and other predators. Historical uses The tough, fibrous inner bark of the pawpaw was used by Native Americans and settlers in the Midwest for making ropes, fishing nets, mats, and for stringing fish. Pawpaw logs have been used for split-rail fences in Arkansas. The hard, brown, shiny lima-bean-sized seeds were sometimes carried as pocket pieces in Ohio. Cultural significance Old song A traditional American folk song portrays wild harvesting of pawpaws; Arty Schronce of the Georgia Department of Agriculture gives these lyrics: He notes that \\"picking up pawpaws\\" refers to gathering the ripe, fallen fruit from beneath the trees, and that the \\"pocket\\" in the song is that of an apron or similar tie-on pocket, not a modern pants or blue-jeans pocket, into which pawpaws would hardly fit. A \\"pawpaw patch\\" refers to the plant's characteristic patch- forming clonal growth habit. Place names The pawpaw is the basis for various place and school names in the United States, almost all using the older spelling variant \\"paw paw\\". * The Paw Paw Tunnel in Maryland is a 3118-foot (950-m) canal tunnel completed in 1850 to bypass about 5 miles of the 6-mile-long Paw Paw Bends of the Potomac River near the town of Paw Paw, West Virginia, all ultimately named after the pawpaw tree. * In Michigan, the Paw Paw River is named for the pawpaw trees that grew along its banks.

The battle resulted in a tactical victory by the French Navy over the Royal Thai Navy although the strategic result is disputed. The Japanese intervened diplomatically and mediated a ceasefire. In the end, two Thai ships were sunk and one was heavily damaged. Within a month of the engagement, the French and the Thais negotiated a peace which ended the war. Background Situation The Franco-Thai War was going quite poorly for the French land forces, who were ill-equipped to deal with the larger Thai Army. The French Governor General of Indochina and Commander-in-Chief Naval Forces, Admiral Jean Decoux, decided Indochina's best chance at stopping the incursions would be attempt a naval attack on the Thailand's fleet and coastal cities. This would clear the way for bombardment missions to support a counter-offensive along the Cambodian frontier. Thai Navy Although comparatively small, the Royal Thai Navy had been modernized with the recent acquisition of vessels from both Japan and Italy. The major units of the fleet included two Japanese-built armoured coast defence vessels, which displaced and carried 8-inch (203 mm) guns, two older British-built armoured gunboats with 6-inch (152 mm) guns, 12 torpedo boats, and four submarines. In addition, the Royal Thai Air Force had on its rosters over 140 aircraft, including relatively modern Mitsubishi Ki-30 (Allied reporting name \\"Ann\\") light bombers, which saw extensive service against the French during the war. These aircraft were quite capable of disrupting any French naval operation which might be mounted. Other less capable aircraft in the Thai inventory included P-36 Hawk fighters, 70 Chance-Vought O2U-2 Corsair biplanes, six Martin B-10 bombers, and several Avro 504 trainers. French Navy Lamotte-Piquet Admiral Jean Decoux formed a small squadron called the Groupe Occasionnel (ad-hoc group) on 9 December 1940 at Cam Ranh Bay, north of Saigon. In command he placed Capitaine de Vaisseau R√©gis B√©renger. The squadron consisted of: * the light cruiser : a light cruiser built in 1923. The ship was fast but poorly armored. * the modern avisos and . Those ships were especially designed for colonial service and could embark a company of infantry. They were very lightly armed and without armor. * the older avisos Tahure and Marne. There was no air cover, except for nine Loire 130 seaplanes based at Ream, which provided reconnaissance. Additional scouting was done by three coastal survey crafts, and intelligence gleaned from local fishermen. Plan of attack B√©renger's squadron began training manoeuvres in Cam Ranh Bay shortly after assembling. On 13 January 1941, Admiral Decoux formally requested that B√©renger lead the squadron against the Thai Navy to support a land offensive planned for 16 January. The land action was meant to force back the Thai ground forces that had been advancing along the coast. Because of the disparate speeds of the French ships, B√©renger sent the slower sloops on ahead, while he remained in Saigon to complete the final elements of the plan. Several options were being prepared, the Admiralty in France having given its approval to use naval forces to support the army. The final planning meeting on 13 January saw an immediate delay in the execution for 24 hours. Once the plans were completed, B√©renger sailed in Lamotte-Picquet. The delay in starting the operation allowed him to refuel at Cape St. Jacques before his rendezvous with the slower ships at 16:00 on 15 January, north of Poulo Condore. Admiral Decoux's order were simple: \\"Attack the Siamese coastal cities from Rayong to the Cambodian frontier to force Siamese government to withdraw its forces from the Cambodian frontier\\". On the evening of 15 January, following a last conference on board the flagship, the squadron weighed anchor at 21:15 and closed the Thai coast at , the top speed of the sloops. The French ships remained undetected as they entered the Gulf of Siam, but their quarry was not as fortunate. The Loire 130s from Ream had completed a sweep of the coast from Trat to Sattahip. They had sighted one coastal defence ship and one torpedo boat at Ko Chang, and one gunboat, four torpedo boats, and two submarines at Sattahip. Their report was forwarded to Marine Headquarters in Saigon, who re-transmitted it to the Lamotte-Picquet. B√©renger considered his options and decided on a dawn attack against the Thai ships at Ko Chang. He ignored Sattahip because the sloops would not be able to reach it until later in the day, when the element of surprise would already have been lost. Also, the strength of Sattahip's harbour defences was unknown. The Thai Naval force at Ko Chang was weaker and thus offered a better chance of victory. B√©renger approached Ko Chang at dawn from the southwest. Because the anchorage was surrounded by islands and islets, many over high, the squadron would separate and use the cover of the islands to concentrate fire on portions of the Thai squadron, while also covering all the avenues of escape. The easternmost channel was the most likely route by which a breakout would be made. It was the most suitable route and where the reconnaissance had placed the largest Thai ships. The Lamotte-Picquet would head to the eastern side of the anchorage to block the route, while the sloops blocked the center and pounded the Thai ships there. The smaller French ships would concentrate to the west. Battle Amiral Charner The French squadron closed on the anchorage at 05:30 on 17 January. At 05:45, they split into the three groups as planned, the Lamotte-Picquet heading for the eastern part of the anchorage, Dumont d'Urville and Amiral Charner continuing to the central position, and the Tahure and Marne heading for the western side. Conditions were perfect. The weather was fine, the seas calm and almost flat. Sunrise was at 06:30, and the scene was lit only by the first rays of light on the horizon and by the dim moonlight. A final aerial reconnaissance of the target area had been arranged, using one of the Ream-based Loire 130s. The Lamotte-Picquet carried two such aircraft, but these could not be launched due to catapult problems. At 06:05, the Loire 130 overflew the anchorage and reported two torpedo boats. This came as a nasty surprise to the French. Previous reports led them to believe that only one was present, but during the night HTMS Chonburi had arrived to relieve the HTMS Chantaburi, which was to return to Sattahip later that day for repairs. Once their presence had been passed to the Lamotte- Picquet, the aircraft attempted a bombing attack, but were driven off by a heavy barrage of anti-aircraft fire. The effect of this mission was double edged. The French were now aware of what they faced, but the element of surprise had been wasted and thirty minutes remained until sunrise. Caught with their crews asleep, the Thai ships desperately began to raise steam and prepared to slip their anchors. However, both torpedo boats were soon sunk by heavy gunfire from the Lamotte-Picquet. The cruiser also destroyed a shore observation post, preventing the Thai from quickly relaying information to their air forces at Chantaboun.\\"The Battle of Koh Chang (January 1941)\\" netmarine.net National Memorial, Lam Luk Ka District, Pathum Thani Province At 06:38, lookouts on the Lamotte-Picquet spotted the coastal defence ship heading northwest, at a range of . A running battle began, with the fire of both ships frequently blocked by the towering islets. The fire from the Thai ship was heavy, but inaccurate. By 07:15, fires could be seen on the HTMS Thonburi, which then found herself engaging not only by the cruiser but also the sloops. At the beginning of the engagement, a lucky shot from the Lamotte- Picquet killed the captain of the Thonburi, Commander Luang Phrom Viraphan, and disrupted her operations. Believing they had a better chance of hurting the smaller French ships, the Thais shifted their fire onto the Amiral Charner, which soon found 8-inch (203 mm) salvoes falling around her. The Thonburi shifted fire back to the Lamotte-Picquet after a salvo from the French cruiser put her aft turret out of action. She soon reached the safety of shallow water, which the French ships could not enter for fear of grounding, but the Thonburi was already burning fiercely and listing heavily to starboard. Her remaining turret was jammed and could not fire unless the manoeuvres of the ship put it in an appropriate position. At 07:50, the Lamotte-Picquet fired a final salvo of torpedoes at , but lost sight of the Thonburi behind an island from which she was not seen to emerge. At 08:40, B√©renger ordered the squadron to head for home, but this coincided with the start of the expected Thai air attacks. Thai planes dropped several bombs close to the Lamotte-Picquet and scored one direct hit; however, the bomb failed to explode. The Lamotte-Picquets anti-aircraft guns put up a vigorous barrage and further attacks were not pressed home. The final raid occurred at 09:40, after which the French squadron returned to Saigon. Aftermath HTMS Thonburi Memorial, Royal Thai Naval Academy, Samut Prakan, Thailand A plaque commemorating the battle The French left behind them a scene of total devastation. The Thonburi was heavily damaged and grounded on a sand bar in the mouth of the Chanthaburi river, with about 20 dead. The Thai transport HTMS Chang arrived at Ko Chang shortly after the French departed and took the Thonburi in tow, before purposefully running her aground again in Laem Ngop. The ship capsized in the shallow waters. The torpedo boat Chonburi was sunk with a loss of two men, as was the HTMS Songkhla with fourteen dead. The survivors were rescued by the torpedo boat HTMS Rayong, the minelayer HTMS Nhong Sarhai, and the fishery protection vessel Thiew Uthok. These three ships, which had been sheltering to the north of Ko Chang, wisely chose not to break cover and were not spotted by the French. On the other hand, the French sailors were elated, believing they had inflicted a decisive defeat while not suffering losses of significance, with only 11 men killed. The French did not have the time to capitalize on their success. Fearing that any further action by the French might turn back the Thai invasion, the Japanese government offered to mediate a peaceful settlement. The agreement ultimately confirmed the Thai annexations of the territory they had lost to France in the late-19th century. However, even this interim of peace did not last long, as the Imperial Japanese Army invaded Thailand in December of that year as part of its attempt to capture British Malaya. At the conclusion of World War II, Thailand was forced to return all of its short-lived gains to French Indochina. The Thonburi was later raised by the Royal Thai Navy. She was repaired in Japan and was used as a training ship until she was finally decommissioned. Her guns and bridge are preserved as a memorial at the Royal Thai Naval Academy at Samut Prakan. During the post-action investigations, the Thai Navy claimed, based on statements by Thai sailors and the fisherman around Ko Chang and merchantmen in Saigon, that heavy damage was seen to have been caused to the Lamotte-Picquet and her squadron. The report claimed the crew of the Lamotte-Picquet spent all of the following night repairing the damage. Such claims are not mentioned in any French documentation, nor in the ships' logs.

The Metropolitan Cathedral Church of the Holy Cross, Our Lady of Regla, and St Francis of Assisi is the main ecclesiastical building of the Catholic Church in Chihuahua City, Chihuahua, Mexico. It is considered perhaps the finest example of colonial architecture in northern MexicoAAA 2007 Mexico Tourbook, p. 166, AAA Publishing, Heathrow, FL and it was built between 1725-1792. The cathedral is also the seat of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Chihuahua. the archbishop was Constancio Miranda Weckmann. Style and architecture The building is situated on the Plaza de Armas. It is designed in the Spanish Baroque style, and is in the form of a latin cross, with a dome above the crossing. The fa√ßade is interesting in that it involves the use of solomonic columns which were not widely used in New Spain at the time. It has an octagonal window that was shipped from Germany and is considered a fine specimen of the glassmakers art. In addition, the front contains a collection of monuments celebrating the twelve apostles, with a clock above, crowned with the sculpture of an angel that was added in the 19th century. The royal Spanish coat of arms occupied the area below the angel, but was removed by architect Jos√© F√©lix Maceira in 1874 and the clock, which was acquired in London, was added, giving the fa√ßade its present appearance. The nave is divided from the ambulatories by arches which support the massive ceiling, and has a fine baptistry chapel on the right, or north side, just inside from the narthex. Directly opposite, on the south side, inside the Chapel of Christ of Mapim√≠, is the tomb of St Peter of Jesus Maldonado, a priest and martyr who was ordained in the Cathedral Parish of Saint Patrick in El Paso, Texas, and canonised by Pope John Paul II in 2000. The chapel is decorated with an 18th- century retablo, or reredos containing a venerated image of Christ, in which Primitive and Baroque elements are mingled. The chancel contains an unusual double altar, in which a smaller altar of Carrara marble was incorporated into the existing larger one of local quarry stone, after the church was built. The organ in the east gallery was built in 1885 by Hook and Hastings, Op. 1244 (2 manuals, 18 registers), and rebuilt and expanded by E F Walcker & Cie. in 1960. The Hook and Hastings instrument had, in turn, replaced a George Jardine organ that was built in 1837, and rebuilt by Jardine in 1869. The Blessed Sacrament Chapel, of baroque and rococo design, is reached by a door in the south side of the nave. The sculpture above the entrance depicts Our Lady of Regla and her supplicants, Ss Francis of Assisi and Rita of Cascia, the patrons of the city, above the Hebrews Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego in the fiery furnace (see illustration below). The Sacred Art Museum is located in the crypt, adjacent to the tombs of the past prelates of the archdiocese. It displays a collection of paintings by such known Colonial-era artists as Miguel Cabrera, Jos√© de Alc√≠bar, Jos√© de P√°ez and Antonio de Torres; portraits of Pope John Paul II and the prelates of Chihuahua are represented as well. The throne that the Pope used during his 1990 Mass in Chihuahua and the large and ornate former archbishops cathedra and canopy are on display, as are contemporary paintings of the cathedral and several life-sized statues of the saints, some of which are two centuries old. History The nave and chancel of the Metropolitan Cathedral of Chihuahua Originally, Sergeant-Major Don Juan Antonio Trasvi√±a y Retes, one of the leading Spanish citizens of the village, donated the land for the first church in the villa, where the cathedral would later stand. The first stone was placed on 21 June 1725 by the Bishop of Nueva Vizcaya in Durango, Don Benito Crespo y Monroy (in those times, Chihuahua depended religiously upon, and was a part of, the Diocese of Durango.) The church was paid for with local commercial donations and by mine owners in the city and in Santa Eulalia, a pueblo to the east, and also by a tax of one real on each mark of silver that was mined in the province. The Plaza de Armas and Cathedral, c.1874. The first superintendent of construction was Pedro Coronado, followed by Miguel de la Sierra and then Master Architect Jos√© de la Cruz, who finalised the plans, and was buried in the church upon his death in 1734. Others followed until Architect Bernardo del Carpio began the construction of the towers in 1758. The bells had been cast in 1730, and were placed in the newly completed towers in 1780, directed by Superintendent Melchor Guaspe. Construction of the church was completed in 1792. The building was slightly damaged during the French intervention in Mexico, repaired, and was designated a cathedral on 23 June 1891, with the erection of the Chihuahua diocese from the Diocese of Durango. At that time, the new diocese was responsible for the faithful throughout the entire state. Chihuahua was elevated to the status of an archdiocese on 22 November 1958 and now is the metropolitan archdiocese for five suffragan dioceses in the state of Chihuahua. In 1910, with the commemoration of the Century of the Independence of Mexico, the cathedral was decorated with lights. It wasn't until 2005 when the cathedral was illuminated again, this time permanently. In October 2008 celebrating the upcoming Tricentennary of the city of Chihuahua, a lights display show took place at the Cathedral.

During a set at the Echo four or five or six years ago, they found some top-secret dial on the back of their synthesizer and slowly started turning up the insanity, pounding away at the same unrelenting riff until a roomful of people was twitching and frothing at the mouth. So you could say I've got high hopes for this appearance at Part Time Punks' anniversary show. These weapons-grade Texan psychedelicists match truly primitive electronics, rhythms like Konono N¬∞1, bleeps and wooshes from some kind of Soviet radar system, etc., to unending slo-mo distorto guitar that fills the room like boiling oil and ghost vocals from the other side. Like all Indian Jewelry releases, new album Peel It demands your total commitment.

Erika Thrasher and Brandon Davis are certainly sound pioneers in their own right, and whether performing under the name of Indian Jewelry or one of their myriad other monikers (including the hilariously ghoulish Corpses of Waco), this is one act that doesn‚Äôt sit comfortably as a noise band, post-punk outfit, no- wave project, psychedelic rock collective or experimental shoegaze freakout. At the same time, there are elements of all that and more in the group‚Äôs mind- bending performances. With song titles that suggest more than a passing familiarity with esoteric knowledge and mysticism, Indian Jewelry will mesmerize you with far more than clever rhetoric.\\" History Swarm of Angels was a noise-rock band from Houston, Texas, in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The original lineup was made up of members of competing bands. With the formation of Swarm of Angels, The Fever's Erika Thrasher ended the \\"Westheimer Street Festival albino-cobra custody\\" dispute with Japanic's Tex Kerschen. Ralf Armin of the Vulgarians joined Matty & Mossy's Matt Frey and Domokos/A Pink Cloud of Rusted Shut, members of bands competing for the #1 slot on Rice Radio's top 35 charts. This lineup shifted, and led to the formation of what became Indian Jewelry. In early 2016 the band changed their name to Studded Left.

It came into existence on 1 April 1993. The city is the district headquarters of Bhadrak district. According to legend, the city derives its name from the Goddess Bhadrakali, whose temple is on the banks of the Salandi River. History According to legend, Bhadrak derives its name from the Goddess Bhadrakali, whose temple is situated on the southwest outskirts of the town. It is an ancient land, dating from the age of the Puranas. Bhadrak's contribution to Odisha's maritime and agrarian prosperity, trade, and commerce throughout the ages is a part of history. In the Mughal period, Bhadrak was a subah, or province, under the Nawabs of Bengal. When the imperial power of the Mughals waned, the area consisted of principalities such as Kanika, Nampo, and Agarapada, with administrative sub-units called chowparhies, all ruled by Kshatriya chiefs. After the occupation of Odisha by the British in June 1804, Bhadrak constituted one of the two administrative divisions of Cuttack and Balasore. In 1828, when Balasore was made a separate district, Bhadrak became one of its sub-divisions with an assistant magistrate and deputy collector as the sub- divisional head; but the munsif's court remained in Jajpur until 1901. Bhadrak was at the forefront during the period of national struggle. In 1920, Mahatma Gandhi's non-cooperation movement was launched. In March 1921, Gandhi visited Bhadrak, after being impressed by its nationalistic fervor and fighting spirit. In 1922, he started the rebellion of Kanika which British troops stationed at Bhadrak attempted to suppress; but ultimately the tenants' movement triumphed, under the leadership of Chakradhar Behera, the doyen of Kanika. When the civil disobedience movement was launched in 1930, Bhadrak became ardent with patriotic zeal, the salt law was defied, and success achieved against the government. Harekrushna Mahatab's role in this success has become cherished in Bhadrak, and a part of the history of modern India. Gandhi, who visited Bhadrak again in 1934, staying in Mahatab's residence at Nuabazar, addressed a meeting of the Harizan workers in Jimbaran Ashram (Nuasahi, Ashram, Garadpur). It was during this time that Banchhanidhi Mohanty of Eram was by his patriotic songs shaping, stimulating, and sensitizing the national consciousness among the people. Since independence, the history of Bhadrak has been of progress in education, industry, agriculture, trade, and commerce. Climate Transportation Bhadrak town is well connected with the state of Odisha, and to other parts of the country as well. The town lies on National Highway 16, northeast of Bhubaneswar, the state capital. Bhadrak town has three bus stations, one on NH 16, the others near Bant Chhak and Charampa. There are frequent buses to and from Cuttack, Bhubaneswar, Balasore, and Calcutta. Bhadrak railway station is at Charampa, which is north of Bhadrak city. The nearest airport is Biju Patnaik International Airport, southwest, near Bhubaneswar. The nearest port is Dhamra Port, around 75 kilometers east of the town. Demographics , Bhadrak has a population of 107,463. Males constitute 51% (55,090) of the population and females 49% (52,373). Bhadrak has an average literacy rate of 79.49%, higher than the national average of 59.5%; with 83.99% of males, and 74.77% of females, literate. 12% (13,138) of the population is under 6 years of age. Politics Bhadrak is part of Lok Sabha Constituency 3 Bhadrak(SC). The present Member of Parliament is Manjulata Mandal, of the Biju Janata Dal (BJD). The current MLA from the Bhadrak assembly constituency is Sanjib Mallick, of the BJD, who won the seat in 2019. Previous MLAs from this seat were Jugal Kishore Pattnaik (BJD), who was the MLA for two terms up to 2019; Naren Palei, of the INC, elected in 2004; Biren Palei, INC, in 2000; Prafulla Samal (BJD), who won in 1995 and in 1990; Jugal Kishore Pattanayak, who won in 1985, as a member of the INC, and in 1980, as a member of INC(I); and Ratnakar Mohanty, of JNP, in 1977. Education Bhadrak Institute of Engineering and Technology (BIET) The higher education institutions of the district are the Bhadrak Institute of Engineering and Technology (BIET) and Bhadrak Autonomous College, among others. There are six new industrial training institutes (ITI) in Bhadrak, whose courses impart technical skill to students. There are also numerous secondary schools.

It is the center of an annual celebration called Eid-Miladun-Nabi, which commemorates the prophet Mohammad's birthday. As a religious hub, Bhadrak is also home to festivals and religious celebrations. The \\"Pana Sankranti\\" held at Chhatrapati, 14 to 21 April, is one of the most famous. \\"Dola Purnima\\" or Holi (Melana) is also another major festival; it is celebrated in several locations in Bhadrak.

It is also believed to be haunted. In 2003 a fire badly damaged the house. The museum has undergone major renovations over the past decade and, as of Summer 2014, is once again open to the public. The Metlar‚ÄìBodine House's \\"Red, White, and Boom\\" Madeira wine tasting event on July 6, 2014 kicked off its campaign to raise money to build a new educational wing to house the historically significant Ross Hall Wall. In July 1778, George Washington headquarters were at Ross Hall and his 11,000 patriots camped along the Raritan River in Piscataway. It was there that General Washington wrote the first order for the United States Army to celebrate the 4th of July ‚Äì a tradition that continues to this day. The troops were ordered to march across the river on Landing Lane Bridge, line the banks of the Raritan in New Brunswick, and shoot their rifles down and up the line in the first organized salute to the nation's independence. They were then given an extra ration of rum and that evening the General had a party for officers (including Alexander Hamilton, the Marquis de Lafayette and Baron Von Stuben) and their ladies at Ross Hall. The building was destroyed in the 1960s but because of its significance, a parlor wall was saved and was exhibited at the New Jersey Historical Society until it was given to the Township and the Metlar‚ÄìBodine House in 2000. Currently, the parlor wall is dismantled and stored in a large warehouse owned by Piscataway Township. The wall must be restored and relocated to a facility that is climate controlled and protected. It is estimated that the wall's restoration and an addition to the Metlar‚ÄìBodine House will cost close to $1 million. History In the early 1700s, Raritan Landing, New Jersey had 70 homes belonging to Dutch merchants. In 1728 Peter Bodine, who owned a storehouse, built a two-story house near the Raritan River. In 1733 he sold his house to Hendrick Lane (?-1761). After Lane's death in 1761 this widow, Margaret lived in the house, but in 1780 she sold the property to William French, the son of a sea captain. Isaac Lawrence bought the house from French in 1814. In 1840, William Phillips was the owner and he added an addition to the house. In 1853 Samuel Knapp purchased the house and of the property, and he may have added a second addition to the house around 1870. In the 1890s, the house was owned by George Metlar, of New Brunswick, New Jersey . He used it to house his property manager, John Mason. Metlar's son John moved to the home with his wife in 1904 and shared it with the Mason. In 1914 John Metler inherited the property. John sold some of the land and in 1955 sold the house and the remaining to John P. Newton. In 1977 the state of New Jersey purchased the property. They planned to use the property for the New Jersey Route 18 bridge to cross the Raritan River from New Brunswick, New Jersey to Piscataway, New Jersey. It is now owned by the New Jersey Department of Transportation. On July 17, 2003, a fire damaged the house.

The car had seating space for three passengers and had much luggage space. The vehicle was also aquatic-capable. The Racoon could be raised upwards to provide additional ground clearance. The construction of its suspension meant this was achieved with a levered effect. The car also had many radical features such as rain-diffusing glass, remote controlled entry, computer control, satellite navigation and cameras as opposed to rear view mirrors. While these technologies have become much more affordable and reliable, at the time of its launch most of this technology was still in its infancy.

Founding  The team was one of two (the Toledo Tigers being the other) created to fill one of the vacancies created in the NNL after the Cleveland Tate Stars and Pittsburgh Keystones had been dropped after the previous season. It drew much of its personnel from the disbanded Keystones and from the New Orleans Crescent Stars, an independent southern team. Hall of Fame outfielder Pete Hill, 40, was asked by Rube Foster to manage the team, and remaining roster spots were filled from tryouts held in Chicago in April, and by castoffs from other teams.  League play and demise  With limited financing and an inexperienced ownership, the team quickly fell out of the running in the league. Primarily due to poor home attendance at Athletic Park (later known as Borchert Field), the club played most of its games on the road, and finished in last place with a 12-41 record in league play, disbanding after the season. Players Outfielders Pete Duncan (.321), Percy Wilson (.314), and Sandy Thompson (.310) were among the better hitters. Fulton Strong led the pitching staff with only four victories, against 14 defeats. Hill hit .296 in a part-time role as the Bears' player-manager.

It can even affect the eyes, causing scotoma and amblyopia. The condition occurs more frequently in women, and usually manifests itself when a person is between twenty and forty years old. Presentation The burning heat is usually limited to the soles of the feet, but may extend up to the ankles or lower legs of some patients. The burning can sometimes be accompanied by feelings of 'pins and needles' or tingling in these regions. Nighttime is when almost all sufferers of this syndrome report the heat symptoms being the worst, with the condition getting better as morning comes. Those who have psychosomatic disorders sometimes display psychological symptoms along with the burning of feet associated with the syndrome. For most, there is no redness of the skin of their feet during the heat sensations, and almost never is there accompanying tenderness along with it. Causes Burning feet syndrome can be inherited, or it can be caused by pressure being put on the nerves. Links also exist between this syndrome and diseases such as hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus, and rheumatoid arthritis; links are also believed to exist between this syndrome and vitamin B (specifically pantothenic acid) deficiencies and kidney failure. It seems to be a small fiber neuropathy.Tavee J, Zhou L. Small fiber neuropathy: A burning problem. Cleve Clin J Med. 2009 May;76(5):297-305. Review. [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE] Diagnosis Diagnosis is mainly clinical. Symptoms are burning sensation in soles, sometime ankles and legs in many patients. Tingling sensation and pin prick sensations are also common. Sweating of legs and soles is seen. In some case hypertrophy of one of the legs is seen mainly in tropical region where external temperature is also higher. Eponym Termed Grierson-Gopalan syndrome after Coluther Gopalan and J.

Plot Gino, a humble shoe-shiner in Chicago, is approached by a Mafia don who offers him a large sum of money to take the blame for a murder committed by another gangster. When he refuses, the don starts to order what may be a hit on him. Gino then agrees, planning to buy a fishing boat with the money he will earn after a three-year sentence. He signs a confession and allows his fingerprints to be put on the murder weapon. While preparing for his court confession, Gino is watched over by Jerry, a bottom-rung gangster who has recently gotten into trouble for failing to follow orders. Facing a boring stay at a local hotel and faced with Gino's inability to suggest recreations he would like for his last few days of freedom, Jerry decides to give Gino a weekend to remember in Lake Tahoe before he goes to prison. Arriving at the resort and casino, Jerry's tall tales and Gino's quiet dignity immediately get Gino mistaken for a powerful mafioso, resulting in them being treated as VIPs. However, they are then summoned to the Nevada home of crime boss Vincenzo, where a frantic Jerry is certain that their lowly status will be found out. However, Vincenzo takes a liking to Gino and the two elderly Sicilians bond. Narrowly escaping after the Chicago don turns up at Vincenzo's home as part of a mafia meeting, a relieved Jerry manages to get Gino back to Chicago safely. Jerry, who has become sympathetic to Gino, now urges Gino to flee but he refuses to break his word. However, on the day Gino is to confess in court, Jerry discovers that his superiors were merely stalling for time. Gino is to be killed, and Jerry is to be the one who does the killing.

Stimuli of the senses can include sound that one hears, foods that one tastes, textures that one feels, and so forth. Increased touch sensitivity is referred to as \\"tactile hyperesthesia\\", and increased sound sensitivity is called \\"auditory hyperesthesia\\". In the context of pain hyperaesthesia can refer to an increase in sensitivity where there is both allodynia and hyperalgesia. In psychology, Jeanne Siaud-Facchin uses the term by defining it as an \\"exacerbation des sens\\" that characterizes gifted children (and adults): for them, the sensory information reaches the brain much faster than the average, and the information is processed in a significantly shorter time. Other animals Feline hyperesthesia syndrome is an uncommon but recognized condition in cats, particularly Siamese, Burmese, Himalayan, and Abyssinian cats. It can affect cats of all ages, though it is most prevalent in mature animals. The disease can be somewhat difficult to detect as it is characterized by brief bursts of abnormal behavior, lasting around a minute or two. One of its symptoms is also found in dogs that have canine distemper disease (CD) caused by canine distemper virus (CDV).

He was the CEO and Commissioner of the XFL until it suspended operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Prior to that, he was Director of Intercollegiate Athletes at West Virginia University (WVU), his alma mater, and an executive with the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) in charge of the organization's regulatory functions. Luck is a retired American football player who spent five seasons in the National Football League (NFL) as a quarterback for the Houston Oilers (1982‚Äì1986). He was also the first president and general manager of the Houston Dynamo of Major League Soccer (MLS). Under his watch, the Dynamo won the MLS Cup in 2006 and 2007. He is the father of former Indianapolis Colts quarterback Andrew Luck. Football career Collegiate career Darryl Talley (left) and Oliver Luck celebrate WVU's 1981 Peach Bowl victory Luck attended St. Ignatius High School in Cleveland, where he was a standout quarterback. He then enrolled at WVU, playing quarterback from 1978 to 1981. In his freshman season, Luck only had 151 yards passing and five interceptions. As a sophomore in 1979, he passed for 1,292 yards and eight touchdowns, but threw 12 interceptions. He also rushed for 407 yards and five touchdowns, including a career-high 120 yards against Tulane. In his junior season of 1980, Luck earned first-team Academic All-American honors. Luck's 19 touchdown passes was a school record, while he also added 1,874 yards. As a senior in 1981, he led the Mountaineers to the Peach Bowl where they defeated the Florida Gators by a score of 26‚Äì6. Also named Academic All-American for the second consecutive season, Luck threw for a school record 216 completions and 394 attempts to add to his 2,448 yards and 16 touchdowns. He added career-highs 360 passing yards and a school-record 34 completions in a loss to Syracuse that season. Luck, who was a three-year starter, ended his career with school records of 43 career touchdown passes, 466 completions, and 911 pass attempts. His 5,765 career passing yards currently ranks fourth on the all-time school list. Luck still ranks in the top ten in nearly every career passing category. Luck was a finalist to be a Rhodes Scholar (but he did not obtain the scholarship), a National Football Foundation Scholar, and a two-time GTE/CoSIDA Academic All-American who graduated magna cum laude from WVU in 1982. He was named the team MVP in 1980 and 1981 and won the 1981 Louis D. Meisel Award. He is a member of Phi Beta Kappa. Luck was inducted into the Academic All-America Hall of Fame in 2000. Professional career Luck was the 44th overall selection in the 1982 NFL Draft, taken in the second round by the Houston Oilers. He was the third quarterback taken, after Art Schlichter (4th to Baltimore) and Jim McMahon (5th to Chicago). As a rookie in the strike-shortened 1982 season, Luck saw no action. In his second season, the Oilers inserted him at the starting quarterback position, from which he threw eight touchdowns and 13 interceptions, completing 124 of 217 pass attempts for 1,375 yards as the Oilers struggled to a 2‚Äì14 record. He was a teammate of fellow quarterback Archie Manning during the 1982 and 1983 seasons. In 1984, the Oilers signed Canadian Football League star Warren Moon. Luck played as Moon's back-up for the majority of the season. He completed 22 of 36 pass attempts for 256 yards, two of which were touchdown passes, with one interception. Luck also had some success running the ball, with 10 carries for 75 yards and one touchdown. In 1985 and 1986, Luck continued to play back-up to Moon. He threw 100 passes in 1985, completing 56 of them with two touchdowns and two interceptions. In 1986, Luck's final season in the NFL, he completed 31 of 60 passes for 341 yards with one touchdown and five interceptions.

In 1990, he was the Republican nominee for Congress from West Virginia's 2nd congressional district, which included his alma mater, but was defeated by incumbent Democrat Harley O. Staggers Jr. An ethical controversy arose after his campaign used a mailing list generated by the non-profit Mountaineer Athletic Club to send a photo of himself as WVU's quarterback, along with a letter from Luck, to over 4000 of the club's contributors. A state ethics commission report subsequently found that the list had been generated at Luck's request, and Luck apologized.Hickman,Dave, \\"Luck learned much from run for Congress\\", West Virginia Gazette, June 14, 2010. In 1991, he became general manager of the Frankfurt Galaxy of the fledgling World League of American Football. He held the post for two years until the league was suspended. Upon its resumption in 1995, he became general manager of the Rhein Fire, and was named league president the following year. Luck held that role until 2000, during which time he oversaw the league's rebranding as NFL Europe, intended to strengthen the connection between the league and its parent, the NFL. In 2001 Luck was sworn in as Chief Executive Officer of the Houston Sports Authority. In this role he oversaw the operations of the Harris County Houston Sports Authority, the governmental entity created in 1997 to provide the financing, construction and management oversight of the three large sports and entertainment venues in Houston: Minute Maid Park (home of the Houston Astros), Reliant Stadium, (home of the Houston Texans and the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo), and the new Downtown multi-purpose arena (home of the Houston Rockets and Comets). Prior to joining the Sports Authority, Luck was a top-ranking executive with the National Football League for more than ten years, where he served as Vice President of Business Development and President and CEO of NFL Europe. In 2005, he was named president of the Houston Dynamo of Major League Soccer. Luck worked with the City and County to create a publicly funded downtown soccer stadium, BBVA Compass Stadium, which opened to much fanfare in March 2012.Houston's new stadium \\"proud\\" moment for Luck, Canetti  Houston Dynamo On June 27, 2008, Luck was appointed by West Virginia Governor Joe Manchin to the West Virginia University Board of Governors, effective July 1. On June 9, 2010, Luck was hired as the athletic director of West Virginia University. Two years later his name surfaced as a potential candidate to fill the open athletic director's slot at Stanford University, where his son Andrew played quarterback and one of his daughters played volleyball. But Luck announced on May 17, 2012, that he was staying at WVU. During Luck's tenure the WVU athletic program made significant changes, including: WVU's move from the Big East Conference to the Big 12 Conference; the resignation of head football coach Bill Stewart and subsequent promotion of Dana Holgorsen to that spot; and the firing of baseball coach Greg Van Zant, instituted beer sales at football stadiums, restructured the WVU compliance office,http://www.wvusports.com/staffDirectory.cfm?type=AD2&adCatID;=6 and took the school off of major probation; facilitated multi-media rights to IMG in a 12-year, $86million guaranteed deal, added men's golf after a 32-year hiatus; hired baseball coach Randy Mazey who led the team to a 3rd-place finish in the Big 12,http://www.wvillustrated.com/story/22107461/mazey- bringing-baseball-to-forefront-of-wvu-athletics and organized state TIF funding to build a new baseball stadium eventually known as Monongalia County Ballpark. As of October 12, 2012, WVU amended Luck's employment agreement, extending his contract through 2017. On October 14, 2013, Luck was one of 13 members unanimously chosen by the College Football Playoff Management Committee to select the four teams to compete in the first College Football Playoff which was to be held in 2015. On December 17, 2014, the NCAA announced that Luck would take a newly created post as executive vice president for regulatory affairs. Luck is in charge of all national office regulatory functions, including academics, membership, eligibility, and enforcement. The position had been created by current NCAA president Mark Emmert as part of a major restructuring of his senior staff. Notably, the NCAA offices are in Indianapolis, where Andrew played at the time. On June 5, 2018, the XFL announced that Luck would be the league's Commissioner and CEO. After a start that was possibly \\"the best launch of a new sports league in the last 30 years, if not ever,\\" the league suspended play on Thursday March 12 due to the outbreak of the coronavirus. On Thursday April 9, XFL owner Vince McMahon fired Oliver Luck two working days before the league filed for bankruptcy. Luck sued XFL owner Vince McMahon for wrongful termination on April 21. As XFL President Jeffrey Pollack noted: \\"Our shutdown and our bankruptcy filing had nothing to do with anything other than the pandemic. Our business was working, our proof of concept was successful, and we were on our way to a phenomenal first season.\\" Personal life Luck is married to the former Kathy Wilson, with whom he has four children: Andrew, Mary Ellen, Emily, and Addison. The three oldest are graduates of Stanford University, where Andrew played football and Mary Ellen played volleyball. When Luck's NCAA employment was announced, Addison was attending Morgantown High School. Andrew played quarterback at Stanford and was selected number one overall by the Indianapolis Colts in the 2012 NFL Draft. In addition to his professional pursuits, Luck was actively involved as a coach for youth sports.

The podcast was dedicated to Apple's Macintosh computers and other Apple products such as the iPod. MacBreak was the first podcast in 1080p high definition format, with the release of an episode on the TWiT web site in the format. According to Leo Laporte on This Week in Tech, MacBreak caused bandwidth problems for its service provider, Libsyn. MacBreak is a production of the TWiT.tv network in association with Pixel Corps. It is filmed in San Francisco, California on a greenscreen set at the San Francisco School of Digital Filmmaking. Each episode, the live-action greenscreen footage is keyed and composited over a virtual 3D set by members of the Pixel Corps. This process is explained in the \\"Road to 1080p\\" episodes. Starting in April 2007 with the release of MacBreak #65, \\"MacBreak Minutes\\" hosted by Merlin Mann and Kenji Kato began to appear along with full MacBreak episodes. MacBreak Minutes are short tips that consisted of an application or tool featured in a one- minute condensed video. Regular MacBreak guests/alternate host have included Weezer drummer Patrick Wilson, Kenji Kato, Mark Spencer, Craig Syverson, Cali Lewis, Don McAllister and Dr. Kiki Sanford. As of MacBreak #29, the opening titles were changed to reflect the new lineup of hosts. Amber MacArthur was no longer listed, replaced by Merlin Mann and Kendra Arimoto. iJustine became a host on January 12, 2007. The latest episode was produced May 3, 2011.  MacBreak Weekly  A spin-off called MacBreak Weekly was started on August 13, 2006. It distributed in audio and video formats and features many of the video version hosts as well as special guests. The intro theme is made by Ashley Witt at tenthauser.com.tenthauser.com The usual \\"Mac pundits,\\" as they refer to themselves, are Leo Laporte, Rene Ritchie, Alex Lindsay, and Andy Ihnatko. The content differs from MacBreak in that the discussion mainly covers Apple related news from the previous week. Other segments include a \\"Pick of the Week\\", where the hosts discuss various software and hardware they find useful. Sections and features There used to be a \\"Whine\\" section where the hosts complain about certain features of various Mac OS X applications they wish would be improved. A running joke is that Alex Lindsay tends to pick products with exorbitant price tags, and thus the panel has created a unit of currency, the ‚ÄúAlex‚Äù which is equivalent to the retail price of the current version of Adobe Photoshop (approximately $700.00 US). It is sometimes used as a unit of price for the \\"Picks of the Week\\" segment, while free items are said to be ‚Äúzero Alexes‚Äù. Macbreak Weekly 125 saw the introduction of two new units of price; the \\"Scott\\" is equal to 11 \\"Alexes\\", and the \\"Great Scott\\" is equal to 10 \\"Scotts.\\" The show is often very casual and relaxed, and the hosts get off topic quite a bit which seems to contribute to the overall tone of the show. A recent feature on the show includes a special jingle first introduced by Merlin Mann and then supplied as a full blown song titled \\"Rathole!\\" which is played when the conversation veers very far off from the original topic. Another recurring theme is Leo Laporte's habit of buying Apple products just before they are discontinued, the price cut or the product changes. This started when he bought a Power Mac G4 Cube on the day it was discontinued. (This was referenced in episode 12; \\"Smokin\\") It has become a joke throughout the shows, mostly between Merlin Mann and Scott Bourne. Due to other commitments Merlin Mann has been absent for most shows since episode 104, although he appeared in episode 122. The podcast has show notes published on the TWiT Wiki, under the MacBreak Weekly section. At the end of 2015, MacBreak Weekly was number 18 on the Top 40 US Technology Podcasts, making it the fourth highest weekly Twit.tv podcast.

Life Gent was born in 1895 was the son of John Gent (1844‚Äì1927) and Harriet Frankland Randall. His original name was Gerard Edward James Gent, but he changed it to Edward James Gent, the reasons for which were unknown. He was educated at The King's School, Canterbury, and Trinity College, Oxford. Gent married Guendolen Mary Wyeth in 1923, and they had four children, Marcus James Gent, Gerard Nicholas Gent, Ann Monica Gent and Janice Mary Gent. Military career Gent served with the Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry in the First World War in Flanders and Italy. He was wounded twice and was awarded the Military Cross in 1917 and the Distinguished Service Order in 1919.  Diplomatic career  He was the first appointed Governor of the Malayan Union, Sir Edward also became the first Colonial Administrator to discuss openly to form a better government for the future of Malaya, where later the Federation of Malaya was established. He was an instrumental figure in the formation of the Malayan Union which was established on 1 April 1946 in Kuala Lumpur, and the first Governor of the Malayan Union. When Malaysia achieved independence (Merdeka) from the United Kingdom, his widow Lady Gent, together with Lady Gurney, were invited to the ceremony as guests of honour.  Malayan Emergency  Signature of the Federation of Malaya Agreement, 1948, and the State Agreements, at King's House, Kuala Lumpur, on Wednesday 21 January 1948 Gent remained as the High Commissioner for Malaya when the Malayan Union was dissolved and replaced by the Federation of Malaya. But he did not remain at his post for long. He was sacked by the Colonial Office and recalled to London on 29 June 1948 at the onset of the Malayan Emergency after Malcolm MacDonald, the British Commissioner-General for Southeast Asia, lobbied Whitehall. Gent disbelieved the communists were of any threat and refused to act. When the communists first launched its attacks on Malayan rubber estates, Gent on 16 June declared emergency in parts of Perak and Johor only, much to the rubber planters' disappointment whom demanded for a nationwide declaration. Gent was only forced to widen the declaration to the whole of Malaya the next day when the Straits Times wrote \\"Govern or Get Out\\" on its front page and thus galvanising public sentiment against him. Death Gent was returning to the United Kingdom in an Avro York transport aircraft of the Royal Air Force when it collided with a Douglas DC-6 of Scandinavian Airlines System near Northwood, north London, a week after he was recalled to London.

Membership of the order was awarded to certain distinguished knights and squires of the king, and has roots back as far as 1324.

Elected as Prime Minister by the opposition-dominated National Conference in 1991, Koffigoh was given full executive powers and tasked with overseeing a transition to multiparty elections. Beginning in December 1991, however, President Gnassingb√© Eyad√©ma increasingly reasserted his authority at Koffigoh's expense. Although Koffigoh remained in office, the opposition eventually abandoned him, feeling he had become too cooperative with Eyad√©ma. Koffigoh has been the President of the Coordination of New Forces (CFN) since 1993. He was replaced as Prime Minister after the 1994 parliamentary election, in which the CFN performed poorly, although Koffigoh himself won a seat in the National Assembly. Later, he was Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1998 to 2000 and Minister of Regional Integration, in charge of Relations with Parliament, from 2000 to 2002. Background and political career during the early 1990s Koffigoh was born in Kp√©l√© Dafo. He served as the head of Togo's Bar Association\\"Togo's President Agrees to Yield Power to a Rival\\", The New York Times, 29 August 1991. and in August 1990 he founded the first human rights organization in the country, the Togolese League of Human Rights (Ligue togolaise des droits de l'homme, LTDH), which quickly won support both at home and abroad.John R. Heilbrunn, \\"Togo: The National Conference and Stalled Reform\\", in Political Reform in Francophone Africa (1997), ed. John F. Clark and David E. Gardinier, page 231. He was elected as Prime Minister by the National Conference on 27 August 1991; President Gnassingb√© Eyad√©ma was stripped of his powers and was left as a ceremonial president.\\"Oct 1991 ‚Äî Failure of coup attempts\\", Keesing's Record of World Events, volume 37, October 1991, page 38,518. Koffigoh was tasked by the Conference with forming a transitional government leading to elections that were then planned to be held in 1992, in which neither Koffigoh nor Eyad√©ma were to be allowed to run. Although Eyad√©ma had sought to suspend the Conference, surrounding the venue with soldiers, he subsequently accepted Koffigoh's appointment. Aside from serving as Prime Minister, Koffigoh also became Minister of Defense.\\"Togo Leader Adds to Cabinet to End Crisis\\", The New York Times, 2 January 1992. According to the opposition, Koffigoh's subsequent appointments of supporters and friends to head public enterprises led to some criticism and antipathy from other members of the opposition; he was accused of strengthening his own power base rather than the unity of the opposition, thus weakening the opposition in the ongoing struggle against Eyad√©ma.Heilbrunn, page 238. In the months following his appointment, troops loyal to Eyad√©ma repeatedly tried to oust Koffigoh. On 1 October 1991, they seized the national radio and television station and demanded that Koffigoh resign\\"Effort to oust Togo's interim leader fails\\", Deseret News, 1 October 1991. before leaving the station; Koffigoh said afterwards on the radio that order was restored. A week later, they unsuccessfully tried to kidnap Koffigoh, and four people were reported killed in protests and violence that followed.\\"4 Killed After Rebel Troops Fail to Kidnap Togo Premier\\", The New York Times, 9 October 1991. After Eyad√©ma's party, the Rally of the Togolese People (RPT), was banned by the transitional High Council of the Republic (HCR) in November 1991, soldiers began a siege of Koffigoh's official residence in Lom√© in late November, demanding that Koffigoh's government be replaced and threatening to \\"reduce the city to ashes\\";\\"France Moves Troops to Block Togo Coup\\", Associated Press, 30 November 1991. they also demanded that the RPT be legalized again and that the HCR be dissolved.\\"Soldiers abandon coup bid in Togo\\", The New York Times, 1 December 1991. Koffigoh called for French military aid. Eyad√©ma publicly called on the soldiers to return to their barracks and expressed continued trust in Koffigoh, but also invited him to begin consultations on the formation of a new national unity government. Following Eyad√©ma's call, as well as talks between Eyad√©ma and Koffigoh and between Eyad√©ma and the soldiers, the soldiers lifted their siege after two days; however, they promptly resumed it.\\"Soldiers, Breaking Promise, Resume Palace Siege in Togo\\", The New York Times, 2 December 1991. To appease the soldiers, Koffigoh offered to include supporters of Eyad√©ma in the government, but he refused to dissolve his government altogether, and he again called for French aid.\\"Togo's Prime Minister Proposes Compromise\\", The New York Times, 3 December 1991. On 3 December 1991, soldiers succeeded in capturing Koffigoh in a heavy assault, involving tanks and machine guns, on his official residence. Many people were killed in this violence:\\"Rebels Seize Togolese Premier\\", The New York Times, 4 December 1991.\\"Despite a Coup, Togo's Reform Prime Minister Clings to Post\\", Reuters, 5 December 1991. at least 17, and possibly more than 200. The soldiers took Koffigoh to meet with Eyad√©ma, and later on the same day, Eyad√©ma released a statement saying that he and Koffigoh would form a new transitional government to replace Koffigoh's previous government. Although Eyad√©ma did not take responsibility for the soldiers' actions, he was widely believed to have behind them. Koffigoh said in a news conference that he was not being held prisoner and that he was working on \\"getting things back on track\\"; although he remained in office, his power was considered curtailed. On 31 December, a new government headed by Koffigoh, including three members of the RPT, was announced; most members of Koffigoh's previous government remained, and Koffigoh himself continued to serve as Minister of Defense. The transitional period, which was originally set to end in August 1992, was extended at that point to 31 December 1992.\\"Aug 1992 - Extension of transition period\\", Keesing's Record of World Events, Volume 38, August, 1992 Togo, Page 39041.\\"D√âMOCRATISATION √Ä LA TOGOLAISE\\" (\\"CHRONOLOGIE\\"), T√®t√® T√©t√©, 1998 (diastode.org) . Koffigoh dissolved his government on 1 September 1992, although it remained in place in a caretaker capacity; he and Eyad√©ma agreed on 2 September to holding elections--local, parliamentary, and presidential, along with a constitutional referendum--in stages before the end of the year.\\"Sep 1992 - Continuing problems of transition\\", Keesing's Record of World Events, volume 38, September 1992, page 39,083. Koffigoh formed a new government on 14 September, with 18 ministers, including six from the RPT. On 9 November 1992, he dismissed two RPT members of the government, Minister of Territorial Administration and Security Agb√©yom√© Kodjo and Minister of Communications and Culture Benjamin Agb√©ka,\\"Nov 1992 - Crisis over dismissal of ministers\\", Keesing's Record of World Events, volume 38, November 1992, page 39,179. but Eyad√©ma prevented their dismissal. A rally in support of Koffigoh, who said that he would appeal the matter to the Supreme Court, was held in Lom√© on 11 November. The opposition called a strike in the same month, but on 29 December Koffigoh called for the strike to end; as a result the Collective of Democratic Opposition-2 refused to participate in talks with Koffigoh on 3 January 1993.\\"Jan 1993 - Isolation of Koffigoh\\", Keesing's Record of World Events, volume 39, January 1993, page 39,258. Eyad√©ma reappointed Koffigoh as Prime Minister later in the month, although the opposition and the HCR disputed this on the grounds that only the HCR had the right to appoint the Prime Minister. Having adopted a more cooperative attitude towards Eyad√©ma, Koffigoh became the subject of opposition criticism.\\"Chronology for Kabre in Togo\\", Minorities at Risk Project (UNHCR.org), 2004. The Coordination of New Forces was established in 1993 as a six-party coalition, led by Koffigoh.Political Parties of the World (6th edition, 2005), ed. Bogdan Szajkowski, page 591. In the second round of the February 1994 parliamentary election, Koffigoh was elected to the National Assembly as the UDR/CFN candidate in the Third Constituency of Kloto Prefecture.Journal Officiel de la Republique Togolaise, 8 April 1994, page 6 . He was the only CFN candidate to win a seat.Africa Research Bulletin (1996), page 12,363. Following the election, he resigned as Prime Minister, along with his government, on 21 March 1994. Eyad√©ma appointed Edem Kodjo to replace Koffigoh as Prime Minister in April,\\"Togo Premier Named\\", The New York Times, 24 April 1994. and Kodjo succeeded Koffigoh in office on 25 April. In the National Assembly, Koffigoh was considered a reliable ally of the RPT during the parliamentary term that followed the 1994 election. Political career after 1994 In 1997, Koffigoh was chairman of the organizing committee of the ACP-EU roundtable conference that was held in Lom√©.\\"Programme summary: Radio France Internationale 23rd October 1830 gmt\\", Radio France Internationale, 24 October 1997.

As Foreign Minister, he headed peace talks in Lom√© between the government of Sierra Leone and rebels of the Revolutionary United Front in mid-1999.\\"Nigeria fails to break Sierra Leone stalemate\\", BBC News, 26 June 1999. Koffigoh served as Foreign Minister until he became Minister of Regional Integration, in charge of Relations with Parliament, in the government named on 8 October 2000. He served in the latter position until December 2002., izf.net . Following the April 2005 presidential election, in which Eyad√©ma's son Faure Gnassingb√© was officially elected President but which the opposition denounced as fraudulent, serious violence broke out in Togo. On 25 May 2005, Gnassingb√© created a special 10-member commission of inquiry to examine the violence and deliver findings about it within three months, and he appointed Koffigoh as the head of the commission.\\"Togo: President calls for probe into poll violence\\", IRIN, 26 May 2005. The commission eventually delivered its report on 10 November 2005.

Koffigoh remains President of the CFN as of 2007.\\"Une d√©mocratie en bonne sant√©\\" , Republic of Togo website, 12 January 2007 . In the October 2007 parliamentary election, he was the first candidate on the CFN's candidate list in Kloto Prefecture, but the party did not win any seats in the election.Text of Constitutional Court decision (final election results) , 30 October 2007 . In November 2010, Koffigoh served as head of the African Union observer mission on the presidential election in C√¥te d'Ivoire. Koffigoh's report was highly critical of irregularities and shortcomings in the electoral process in the north of the country and documented significant abuses in regions held by former rebel troops. Nevertheless, Koffigoh attended the disputed inauguration of the incumbent president Laurent Gbagbo in a private, non-official capacity, leading the African Union to distance itself from him. In recent years, Koffigoh has embraced poetry, publishing 4 collections whose topics generally celebrate Togolese and African cultures, and explore challenges facing the African continent.

The scientific name commemorates Adolphe Barrot (1801‚Äì1870), a French diplomat who served in Colombia from 1831 to 1835. Its breeding habitat is forest canopy and edges at altitudes up to 1675m, and this bird can also be found in tall second growth and shady gardens . The female lays two white eggs in a small conical cup nest, which is made of plant down and sited near the tip of a thin branch. The purple-crowned fairy is 11.5 cm long and weighs 6.5 g. It is slender and has bright white underparts, a green back, and a long pointed tail which has black central and white outer feathers. There is a dark patch through the eye, and the bill is sharply pointed. The male has a purple crown and a purple spot at the end of the eyepatch, which is bordered below with a glittering green malar stripe. The song is a vigorous repetition of the high thin tsit call. The female lacks the purple and glittering green colours on the head, and the immature bird has rufous fringes to its upperpart plumage and a dusky throat. The purple-crowned fairy has a very light and graceful flight. It eats insects, picked off the foliage or caught in flight, and takes nectar from flowers, piercing the bases of larger blooms such as Heliconia. Although not particularly territorial, this species is quite aggressive, and will resist the attacks of territorial species.

The Browns initially lived in Melbourne and briefly moved to the rural area of Warrnambool. His father, Parker Brown, also worked in a dispensary, and had performed as a baritone under the name, Frederick Parker, at the Bijou in Melbourne. Parker had studied as a medical student before serving in World War I. He enlisted in the Australian Army in June 1915 and fought at Gallipoli from October until January 1916. He was diagnosed with neurasthenia and was discharged in August 1916 on medical grounds. Dawson later remembered, \\"[m]y dad went to Gallipoli ... but unfortunately he suffered a lot from it and so did the family\\". In June 1919 his mother, Amy, died of unspecified causes and the following year his brother, Les, died by drowning on Christmas Day. By that time his father had remarried. Parker was prone to heavy drinking and violence, Dawson repeatedly ran away from home after his beatings. Once he was nearly choked to death, ran off and, after being caught, he was chained in a dog's tent by his father. From the age of eight or nine he was \\"making up little ditties\\" which soothed him. At about nine-years-old, Dawson was so severely beaten that he ran away from home again. He travelled to his mother's family, the Muirs, in Melbourne and was sent, by a court order, to live for three years at St. Vincent de Paul's Boys' Orphanage, South Melbourne. It was administered by the Catholic Church's Christian Brothers, Dawson was baptised in that faith and took a confirmation name, Aidan. For school holidays he was sent to a farm near Birregurra run by the Carews. He had learned to sing at the orphanage and Jack Carew taught him to play the harmonica and piano accordion. At the age of thirteen Dawson left the orphanage to join his older brother, Peter, working on a farm at Stewarton (about from Goorambat). Each Saturday night he would sing at the local town hall with a repertoire that included \\"Funiculi, Funicula\\", \\"Little Brown Cottage\\" and \\"Good Morning, Good Morning\\". Music and performing career In 1932 Smoky Dawson worked at a tannery and on weekends he played a lap steel guitar in a duo, The Coral Island Boys, with his younger brother, Ted, on Spanish guitar. Both sang lead vocals, with Ted's singing described by Dawson as \\"a much richer voice than mine. He had more depth in his voice\\". They performed then-popular songs, such as \\"Gee But I'm Lonesome for You Caroline\\" and \\"Southern Moon Keep on Shining\\". In 1934, Dawson formed a Western group with an accordionist, a bass guitarist, and Malcolm on violin; which cut a test acetate at Fidelity Records with Jack Murray recording. It was the first professional use of Dawson's nickname, \\"Smoky\\" ‚Äì he had tried pipe smoking when living at Stewarton but it had sickened him. The recording led to sponsorship by Pepsodent ‚Äì a toothpaste company ‚Äì and so the group were named, Smoky and the Pepsodent Rangers. In 1935 they were the first Western group to be broadcast live on an Australian radio station, 3KZ, and by 1937 Dawson had his own radio show. His show was re-broadcast into New South Wales on 2CH as \\"Hill-billy Artists\\" by \\"Smoky\\" Dawson and His Boys. In 1941, he signed with Columbia Records, where he recorded his first commercial releases, including \\"I'm a Happy Go Lucky Cowhand\\" and \\"The Range in the Western Sky\\". He also toured around Australia. Dawson had used music as a way of comforting himself and during World War II he took this talent to boost the morale of others. In 1939 upon the outbreak of the war he had attempted to enlist, but was rejected on medical grounds for a \\"bumpy heart\\". In 1940, with Smoky Dawson's Five-Star Rangers, he would perform at soldier's socials. In 1941 when the Japanese forces approached Australia, he enlisted as a non-combatant nursing orderly and was commandeered by the First Australian Army Entertainment Unit. On 13 March 1944, while still in the army, he married Florence \\"Dot\\" Cheers (12 October 190627 October 2010), an elocution teacher ‚Äì they had met nine years earlier when both worked in radio. Western Mails Louis Clark, described Dawson as an \\"Australian outback songster\\" and the unit as \\"an array of genius\\". Aside from music, Dawson would also perform at rodeos, circuses and country shows demonstrating his skill at knife-throwing using machetes, commando knives, tomahawks, or two-edged axes. By October 1949, Dawson had recorded about 60 tracks from his songbook of 280 tunes ‚Äì all of them \\"have a cowboy setting‚Äîwith a dash of romance\\". Dawson travelled around Australia for eight months a year while Dot remained behind as Auntie June on her own radio show for 3KZ. Dot and Smoky Dawson, Adelaide, November 1952 In March 1951 Dawson, as a cowboy entertainer, narrated a documentary film, directed by Rudall Hayward, on Australian rough riders at a Kyabram rodeo, which was to be broadcast on United States TV. Dawson sang a self-written song praising their skills and noted \\"there's nothing half-baked about Australian rodeos or the boys who ride in them. They're entitled to all the credit we can give them ... Rodeos and rough riders are just as much a part of our national heritage as symphonies and seascapes\\". In June that year Dawson and Dot travelled to the US where he recorded and played at the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville. While in New Jersey, he took the role of Petruchio in a stage version of the musical, Kiss Me, Kate. When Dawson returned to Australia in September 1952 he was hailed as an \\"Australian singing 'cowboy' who has made good in the US at the expense of the world's best\\". For trick riding his palomino horse, Flash (1951‚Äì1982), was bedecked in American-style tack rather than Australian. Flash lived to be 31 years old and Dawson supplemented his feed by giving him porridge with a spoon. Echoing US singing cowboy, Roy Rogers, on 8 December 1952 Dawson starred in his own radio show, The Adventures of Smoky Dawson, which stayed on the air for ten years until 1962. At its peak, Dawson's show was broadcast on 69 stations across the country. Dot also had her own radio shows for children. A related comic book of the same name was published from 1953 to 1962 and both featured \\"Dawson's persona [which] became 'Australia's favourite cowboy', with his faithful sidekick Jingles, his horse Flash and their young friend Billy fighting the evil outlaw Grogan, adhering to Smoky's 'code of the west', pausing for a song, a moral and sometimes a bowl of cornflakes, courtesy of the program's sponsor\\". For the radio show Dawson provided \\"rendition[s] of a magpie, kookaburra, rooster, turkey, pig, cow, an impatient horse, a posse with bloodhounds (with the bandit being shot), a pack of dogs fighting and next door's dog howling in the middle of the night\\". In 1957 he founded the Smoky Dawson Ranch on farm at Ingleside as a venue to host country music shows, a horse riding school and a holiday camp for children. In 1974 a TV series, Luke's Kingdom, was shot at Dawson's ranch. The following year he featured on This Is Your Life hosted by Mike Willesee. In 1988 he appeared in two episodes of TV soap opera, A Country Practice, as a drifter, \\"Charlie McKeahnie\\", who passes through the fictional location of Wandin Valley and proposes to town gossip, \\"Esme Watson\\" (portrayed by Joyce Jacobs). His performance was so popular with viewers that he made another appearance the following year. Dawson was a Freemason.\\"What is Freemasonry?\\" Death In his later years Smoky Dawson was diagnosed with arthritis, emphysema and two hernias. In June 2000 he was knocked down by a hit-and-run driver and had spinal injuries. As of 2004 he and Dot presented a radio show on 2NSB and lived in Lane Cove, New South Wales. Herbert Henry \\"Smoky\\" Dawson died on 13 February 2008 after a short illness, a month short of his 95th birthday. He was survived by his wife, Florence \\"Dot\\" Dawson, an elocutionist, radio actress and presenter, who died on 27 October 2010 at 104 years of age.\\"Smoky Dawson's wife Dot passes away\\". Herald Sun, 28 October 2010, Accessed on 28 October 2010 In a 2005 interview Dawson indicated how he would like to be remembered, \\"Ah well, just as Herb. Just as one who's tried his best, he's carried out, lover of his country and always thought about the good things in life. Being honest and true to yourself, the main thing, true to yourself. And ah, I think to be remembered as an old friend\\". Awards and legacy Smoky Dawson continued his long career of recording and performing after his radio show, and enjoyed performing until he died. He has frequently been recognised for his contributions to music and entertainment. In 1977, with Tex Morton and Buddy Williams, Dawson was inducted into the Hands of Fame at Tamworth. On 31 December 1982 Dawson was awarded an Order of the British Empire ‚Äì Member (Civil) with the citation, \\"In recognition of service to country music\\". In 1978 Dawson was inducted into the Australian Roll of Renown. In 1985 he published his autobiography, Smoky Dawson: A Life. In 1988 Dawson and Trevor Knight won The Heritage Golden Guitar at the Country Music Awards of Australia for \\"The Days of Old Khancoban\\" ‚Äì written by Dawson about the droving days of his youth in the Snowy Mountains. The following year Dawson and Knight won a second Golden Guitar for their song, \\"High Country\\", as Best Vocal Duo or Group. In 1994 Film Australia broadcast his biography based on taped interviews by Robin Hughes for the Australian Biography Project. On Australia Day (26 January) 1999 Dawson was made a Member of the Order of Australia with the citation, \\"In recognition of service to country music\\". In 2005 he was inducted into the Australian Record Industry Association Hall of Fame. He has also been recognised in the US, and received the Honor Award of the Grand Ole Opry. In April 2007 he donated his first electric guitar to the Australian Stockman's Hall of Fame. Smoky's Bar and Grill was opened in his name in 2005 at the West Diggers Club in Tamworth ‚Äì he attended with Dot. His recording career spanned more than six decades, his last album, Homestead of My Dreams, was released in 2005.\\"Folk legend Smoky Dawson dies\\" Powerhouse Museum described him as \\"a singer, showman, songwriter, scriptwriter, knife and double-headed axe thrower and all round performer who has lived a long life entertaining audiences. Through his radio serials, comic books and songs he created the persona of a happy-go-lucky singing cowboy\\". From 2001 the museum has displayed his signed copy of the comic book, The Adventures of Smoky Dawson, and other memorabilia, which was subsequently donated by Dawson in 2004. For his service to country music, Dawson was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (December 1982), a Member of the Order of Australia (January 1999), and was inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame in 2005.

Haynes (born c. 1925) is a British automobile designer. Haynes worked for Ford as Model Line Director for Ford of Europe where he was responsible for the design of the 1966 Cortina MkII and worked on the design for the 1966 Ford Zodiac/Zephyr Mk4. In 1967, he was recruited to BMC by Joe Edwards, working from the Pressed Steel Fisher studios in Cowley..While at BMC, Haynes put forward a plan to build models on just five platforms and reduce the number of brands to make the company profitable. His first job was to work on the shortly to be released Austin Maxi, where he redesigned the front and rear ends. Further work was done on facelifting the successful AD016 Austin/Morris 1100 range, which failed to appear after the formation of the British Leyland (BL) in 1968 and was replaced by the Austin Allegro. Further projects included the 1969 Mini Clubman facelift for the Mini which had been planned as a hatchback in 1968 and designed the 1971 Morris Marina, which were accepted by the management team at BL with minimal modifications, which was amazing as he was up against designs by Pinifarina & Michelotti. Further projects included Project Condor which was a sports car based on the Morris Marina. Haynes left BL in 1969, just 16 months after joining from Ford's, as the new management team closed the Pressed Steel design studio at Cowley, moving the department to Longbridge. It was reported that the journey from his home to Essex was a step to far. Haynes was replaced as chief stylist of, what was by then, British Leyland in 1970 by Harris Mann, whom he had taken with him to BMC from Ford's. In 1976, Roy Haynes formed ElecTraction Ltd Maldon, Essex and designed several electric vehicles for the company through his other company Roy Haynes Automotive International, including the Rickshaw, Tropicana and the concept Precinct but the company closed in 1979. In 2012 in an interview with This is Total Essex, Roy Haynes was promoting his idea for a new London Airport design for Foulness Island, in Essex.

He specialises in the study and treatment of Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, dystonia, spasmodic torticollis, fixed abnormal posture of the neck, tremor, and intractable neuropathic pain. Besides his medical work, he is also notable as a public commentator in support of animal experimentation. Early life and education Aziz was born in Bangladesh into what The Guardian called a \\"medical dynasty\\". He arrived in Britain at the age of 17 with just three O-levels, but after passing A-levels, he studied Neurophysiology at University College London, where he became interested in deep brain stimulation. He went on to study for a doctorate at Manchester University, where he began his research on animals. Career In February 2006, Aziz came to public prominence in the UK when he spoke out in favour of the use of animals in medical research to several hundred demonstrators during a rally held by Pro-Test, a new British group set up to promote the construction by Oxford University of a new biomedical centre in which research on animals, including primates, will be conducted. Aziz is one of two Oxford neurosurgeons who sit on the Pro-Test committee. Pro-Test was formed to counter SPEAK, an animal rights organisation aiming to end vivisection in the UK. In March 2006, he came to public attention again when he defended the use of animals in cosmetics testing, which is banned in Britain. His comments were described as \\"perhaps unfortunate\\" by one colleague. Research interests Aziz's work involves inducing Parkinsonian symptoms in monkeys, either surgically or using drugs, then switching off the symptoms using electrodes he has implanted in their brains. During development of his techniques he has used around 30 monkeys in tests over 20 years, and many believe that as many as 40,000 people around the world have benefitted from the techniques. The Guardian writes that some patients have described the surgery as \\"miraculous\\". In a 2006 BBC Two documentary Monkeys, Rats and Me: Animal Testing, animal rights philosopher Peter Singer described Aziz's research as \\"justifiable\\" on utilitarian grounds. Singer later clarified his statement saying that it would only be justified, in his opinion, if Aziz were willing to do the same experiments on humans of a similar mental capacity. Aziz has said that the emphasis of his future research will be upon viral, gene, and stem cell therapy to treat Parkinson's and similar movement disorders. Research criticism According to The Oxford Student, Malcolm Macleod, a clinical neuroscientist, was asked by Animal Aid to conduct a systemic review into Aziz's research. Macleod accidentally sent an email intended for a colleague to the animal rights group. The e-mail stated he felt that deep brain stimulation was an \\"area of weakness often trumpeted as a success, but which in reality is probably a failure.\\" He asked for \\"advice\\" and suggested he would \\"avoid, play a straight bat or price [himself] out of the market\\" for the review requested. Animal Aid said about the e-mail \\"He [Dr Macleod] feared that an objective investigation of the associated animal research would expose the treatment's shortcomings. He was determined to avoid being drawn into the front line of the vivisection debate.\\" Dr Macleod claimed that he stood by his choice not to do the review \\"I was not comfortable taking part in a study which was motivated by a desire to undermine Aziz.\\"\\"Top brain surgeon slams Aziz research,\\" Rachel Bennett, Oxford Student Animal testing controversy Aziz has been vocal in support of animal testing and his criticism of the animal liberation movement, calling them \\"misinformed and sometimes illiterate anti-vivisectionists who adopt terrorist tactics\\" and who \\"[undermine] the process of democracy\\" through \\"intimidation\\". Britain has \\"probably the most violent and absurd animal rights movement in the world.\\" He told The Guardian, \\"The problem with British society is it has a humanoid perception of animals that‚Äôs almost cartoon-like.\\" Defence of cosmetics testing In an interview published on 4 March 2005, Aziz condoned testing cosmetics on animals, a practice banned in the UK since 1998 and fully across the European Union by 2013. He said that to argue cosmetics testing is wrong is \\"a very strange argument\\", and that \\"[p]eople talk about cosmetics being the ultimate evil. But beautifying oneself has been going on since we were cavemen. If it's proven to reduce suffering through animal tests, it‚Äôs not wrong to use them. To say cosmetics is an absolute evil is absurd.\\" Other scientists who use animals in research have \\"distanced themselves\\" from Aziz's remarks. Clive Page, a researcher at the University of London, said: \\"I don't think we can justify using animals for cosmetics research. [Prof Aziz], like myself and a few others who talk out about this have worked very hard to try and explain to the public why we do medical research on animals and why it's still necessary. To muddy the waters by bringing back an issue of using animals for something that‚Äôs not actually approved in the UK is perhaps unfortunate.\\" Simon Festing, director of the pro-animal experimentation lobby group Research Defence Society said of Aziz: \\"He's not involved in cosmetic testing himself, [Britain's] not involved in cosmetic testing, it's been banned here. There's no movement from the scientific community or the cosmetics industry to have it brought back in. I can't see it being particularly relevant apart from being his personal view.\\" Felix An animal rights campaign has formed around a seven-year-old macaque monkey that Aziz has used in his research. Named Felix by Aziz himself, he is one of 100 purpose-bred monkeys used in animal experiments by Oxford University. Felix was featured in a November 2006 BBC documentary about Aziz's work, \\"Monkeys, Rats and Me\\". The monkey was shown being \\"shaped\\", that is, being encouraged to perform certain tasks by having food and water withheld, in advance of having the symptoms of Parkinson's disease induced. Electrodes were implanted in his brain to test the effects of deep brain stimulation on the Parkinsonian symptoms and on his ability to perform the tasks. He will be destroyed at the end of the experiment, which could continue for several years. Since the BBC documentary aired, SPEAK, a British animal rights campaign formed in 2002, has used the \\"Fight for Felix\\" as a public focus of their efforts to halt the construction of a new ¬£20 million animal-testing facility in South Park Road, OxfordWrong Again, Part I, Felix segment starts at six minutes; Wrong again, part II, SPEAK, The Voice for the Animals. Retrieved 21 June 2008. Awards and nominations In January 2013, Aziz was nominated for the Service to Medicine award at the British Muslim Awards.

Originally the \\"Wolf Cubs,\\" the program offers badges to youth members as a mark of achievement in an interest area. The badges are grouped into six activity areas as described in The Cub Book (Scouts Canada, 2005). While youth experience fun and excitement presented by the program, each activity area focuses on a specific purpose and goal, intended to be relevant to modern children while meeting developmental needs. Originally the requirement entry was age 7 until 2001. Each activity area offers a variety of badges that youth may earn and sew onto their uniform sash: * A uniquely coloured \\"Star\\", awarded for completing a set of introductory requirements in the area. The requirements for a star are flexible, allowing youth to select tasks that are easier than full-blown badge requirements, align with their personal interests, or present an exciting challenge to them. * A number of \\"Activity Badges\\", which focus on a variety of challenging activities in the activity area. Requirements for activity badges vary, and many may be tailored for youths' interests and talents. These activities may be completed individually or with others. * One or two advanced badges known as \\"Awards\\". Typically, youth may only aspire to acquire the awards after first earning the star and a number of badges in the activity area. The six activity areas are outlined in separate sections below. Uniform Recently, the full uniform consists of a grey Cub Scout shirt, khaki shorts or pants, and a neckerchief indicating the youth's group membership. The old uniform was a sandstone Cub Scout shirt which required jeans or black long pants. The activity badges described here are generally worn on the uniform shirt sleeve, with additional badges being held on campfire blankets or display books. A diagram of the uniform, including placement of awards and crests, is provided on the Scouts Canada Website. There is active interest in collecting Canadian Scouting memorabilia, even after youth have completed their years in the program. In addition to merit badges and awards that are worn on the uniform, youth often collect souvenir patches that may be displayed off the uniform; for example, they are often sewn onto campfire blankets or ponchos. Uniform badges will frequently find their way onto these items as well, as youth progress through the program, and are popular conversation pieces at Jamborees and campfires.  Symbols   Cub Scout Promise  The Cub Scouts division has evolved since the 1950s and 1960s when it was extremely large in numbers. The original Cub Scout Promise, written by Scouting's founder Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell, is, \\"I promise to do my best, to do my duty to God and the Queen, to keep the law of the Wolf Cub Pack, and do a good turn every day.\\" In recent years, this Promise has been changed to, \\"I promise to do my best, to love and serve God, to do my duty to the Queen; to keep the law of the Wolf Cub Pack, and to do a good turn for somebody every day.\\" The alternative promise, \\"I promise to do my best, to be true to myself, to do my duty to my country; to keep the law of the Wolf Cub Pack, and to do a good turn for somebody every day,\\" is available beginning in Summer 2020.  The Jungle Book  Numerous symbols and references from Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book are used in Cub Scouts. These include the use of the term Akala as the leader of the Cub Scout Pack, encouragement of use of nicknames of characters in the book for Scouters (the pack's adult leaders), and others.  Structure  Cub scout groups in Scouts Canada are known as Packs. These are typically divided into smaller sections, Lairs. Badges The Natural World - Black Star activities The Natural World activities are intended to create a feeling of care and concern for the natural world, and an interest in nature study. Activities in this area provide opportunities for youth to explore the wonders of nature, learn about the connections between the environment and the life it supports, explore and develop an understanding of the effects people have on the environment, and give direct ideas about how to help the environment in everyday situations. (Scouting and the Family, p.vi) The badges awarded in this activity area are: * Black Star * Astronomer Badge * Observer Badge * Gardener Badge * Naturalist Badge * Recycling Badge * Climate Change Badge * World Scout Environment Award * Canadian Wilderness Award The Outdoors - Green Star activities The Outdoor activity area exists to develop confidence and early leadership skills through basic camping and outdoor interests. Activities in this area instruct youth on how to safely enjoy the outdoors, and encourage learning and participation in a variety of outdoor pursuits. (Scouting and the Family, p.vi) These activities also serve to prepare Cub aged youth to progress to the outdoor activities that are central to Scouting. The badges awarded in this activity area are: * Green Star * Camping Badge * Cooking Badge * Fishing Badge * Hiking Badge * Trailcraft Badge * Watercraft Badge * Winter Cubbing Badge * Canadian Camper Award Creative Expression - Tawny Star activities The purpose of the Creative Expression activity area is to encourage youth to creatively explore and express themselves through activities applying imagination and innovation. Activities are intended to provide creative outlets for children's interests through the use of music, arts, and crafts, increase awareness of how modern technology can be used for creative expression, and promote literacy and reading skills. Youth can also develop a sense of accomplishment by pursuing a project from start to finish. (Scouting and the Family, p.vi) The badges awarded in this activity area are: * Tawny Star * Artist Badge * Carpenter Badge * Collector Badge * Computer Badge * Entertainer Badge * Handicraft Badge * Musician Badge * Photographer Badge * Reader Badge * Canadian Arts Award Health and Fitness - Red Star activities Having an active lifestyle is the first step in being fit and healthy!

A design pattern is a formal way of documenting a solution to a common design problem. The idea was introduced by the architect Christopher Alexander for use in urban planning and building architecture and has been adapted for various other disciplines, including teaching and pedagogy, development organization and process, and software architecture and design. Thus, interaction design patterns are a way to describe solutions to common usability or accessibility problems in a specific context. They document interaction models that make it easier for users to understand an interface and accomplish their tasks. History Patterns originated as an architectural concept by Christopher Alexander. Patterns are ways to describe best practices, explain good designs, and capture experience so that other people can reuse these solutions. Design patterns in computer science are used by software engineers during the actual design process and when communicating designs to others. Design patterns gained popularity in computer science after the book Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software was published. Since then a pattern community has emerged that specifies patterns for problem domains including architectural styles and object-oriented frameworks. The Pattern Languages of Programming Conference (annual, 1994--) proceedings includes many examples of domain-specific patterns. Applying a pattern language approach to interaction design was first suggested in Norman and Draper's book User Centered System Design (1986). The Apple Computer's Macintosh Human Interface Guidelines also quotes Christopher Alexander's works in its recommended reading. Libraries Alexander envisioned a pattern language as a structured system in which the semantic relationships between the patterns create a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts, much like the way that grammatical relationships between words make language meaningful. While some collections of patterns attempt to create the structural relationships needed to form a language, many others are simply an assemblage of patterns (and thus are more appropriately termed pattern libraries.) Mobile interaction pattern libraries The popularity of mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets usher in a need for a library of mobile interaction design patterns. This need is driven by: * Differences in user behavior and interaction on mobile devices such as swipe and tap gestures, vis-a-vis interaction on a Desktop GUI, which is mouse-driven * Differences in physical attributes between a mobile and a desktop device e.g. screen size, touch screen, etc. * Design guidelines recommended by mobile OS e.g. iOS, Android Elements For patterns to be helpful to the designers and developers who will make use of them, they need to be findable and readable. Common elements Though pattern descriptions vary somewhat, many pattern libraries include some common elements: * Pattern Name: Choosing a clear and descriptive name helps people find the pattern and encourages clear communication between team members during design discussions. * Pattern Description: Because short names like \\"one-window drilldown\\" are sometimes not sufficient to describe the pattern, a few additional lines of explanation (or a canonical screenshot) will help explain how the pattern works. * Problem Statement: Written in user-centered language, this communicates what the user wants to achieve or what the challenge is to the end-user. * Use When: \\"Context of use\\" is a critical component of the design pattern. This element helps people understand situations when the design pattern applies (and when it does not.) * Solution: The solution should explain \\"how\\" to solve the problem, and may include prescriptive checklists, screenshots, or even short videos demonstrating the pattern in action. * Rationale: Providing reasons \\"why\\" the pattern works will reinforce the solution, though time-pressed developers may prefer to ignore this explanation. * Examples: Each example shows how the pattern has been successfully applied This is often accompanied by a screenshot and a short description. * Comments: Including a place for team members to discuss the use of the pattern helps maintain an active resource and keeps the team engaged. Optional elements Pattern libraries can also include optional elements, depending on the needs of the team using them. These may include: * Implementation Specifications: A style guide with detailed information about font sizes, pixel dimensions, colors, and wording for messages and labels can be helpful for developers. * Usability Research: Any supporting research from usability tests or other user feedback should be captured. This can also include feedback from developers, customer service, or the sales team. * Related Patterns: The pattern library may include similar patterns, or it may be organized into a hierarchy of parent and child patterns. * Similar Approaches: Since there are likely to be many possible solutions to this problem, teams may want a place to capture similar alternatives. * Source Code: If the code is modular enough to be reused, then it can be included in the library as well. Reasons to use design patterns Benefits of using interaction design patterns include: * Teaching novices some best practices and common approaches * Capturing collective wisdom of designers across many uses and scenarios * Giving teams a common language, reducing misunderstandings that arise from the different vocabulary * Reducing time and costs in the design and development lifecycle * Making usable designs the \\"path of least resistance\\" * Eliminate wasted time spent \\"reinventing the wheel\\" * Ensuring users have a consistent and predictable experience within an application or service Advantages over design guidelines Guidelines are generally more useful for describing requirements whereas patterns are useful tools for those who need to translate requirements into specific software solutions. Some people consider design guidelines as an instance of interaction design pattern as they are also common approach of capturing the experience in interaction design. However, interaction design patterns usually have the following advantages over design guidelines: # Abstract guidelines, like the Eight Golden Rules of Interface Design by Shneiderman, do not suggest how to solve a problem like many interaction design pattern, and cannot be used for interdisciplinary communication. Furthermore, guidelines do not provide an explanation as to why a particular solution works. # Concrete guidelines, like Macintosh Human Interface Guidelines, are too tailored to a specific interface, and therefore are not as effective when applied to other interfaces (especially non-Macintosh interfaces). # Other problems with guidelines are that they tend to be too numerous which makes it difficult for designers to apply the right guidelines. Also guidelines assume an absolute validity while usually they can only be applied in a particular context. A result of that is also that guidelines often tend to conflict just because they lack describing a context. Guidelines and patterns are not necessarily conflicting, and both can be used in conjunction to identify the problem and then create a valid solution.

The village was originally named simply Weald. The parish church is dedicated to St George. It was built in 1821 and was provided as a chapel of ease so that parishioners did not have the long climb to St. Nicholas, the parish church of Sevenoaks. Land and funds were given for the chapel and churchyards by the Lambarde family. Architect Thomas Graham Jackson added a chancel in 1871; the funds were provided by the Hodgson family. Weald Methodist Church on the village green opened in 1843; and also in the village is a former Brethren Gospel Hall dating from 1875 and the former St Edward the Confessor's Roman Catholic Church.

His career was plagued by injuries and only managed a total of seventeen games for Collingwood over the course of six years at the club. Background A mid- sized forward with an athletics background, Rusling was educated at Westminster School in Adelaide, South Australia. He was recruited from West Adelaide, and was drafted in the 2004 AFL Draft by Collingwood in the second round, at No. 23 overall. He made his debut in 2005 against Hawthorn in an injury-riddled side, where he played six games before a shoulder injury ended his season, requiring surgery. He showed his explosive pace and impressive vertical leap to suggest he was a player of the future. With 2006 on the fringes, he re-injured the same shoulder in a pre-season match against Sydney, forcing him out for the first three-four months. A return mid-season in the VFL saw him return after the mid-season break. Career He played the last four games, including a final in 2006, damaging Port Adelaide in a half with three goals and many marks on the lead to continue his expectations. Expecting big things in 2007, Rusling once again required a shoulder reconstruction (on the other shoulder) in the pre-season, with his season ruled out. He did however play two half games in the VFL, before an encouraging round 20 comeback game against Melbourne. He kicked a goal in his return, but a week later he dominated the Sydney defence with four goals and 9 marks. He missed the next week with a thigh injury, but returned for finals, kicking another three goals against the Sydney Swans at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG). His ten goals in five games kept hope of a start to a great career. After a somewhat injury-free pre-season, 2008 saw Rusling play round one against Fremantle at the MCG, but he suffered his fourth serious shoulder injury in as many seasons. Scans revealed the need for a reconstruction, and he missed the remainder of the 2008 season. Rusling had been making steady progress on his rehabilitation during 2009, however during his VFL comeback match in May, Rusling fractured a cheekbone after a marking contest. At the age of 23, Rusling announced his retirement from the AFL on 8 September 2010. Following two years living in Canada, Rusling returned to Australia and signed with South Australian Amateur Football League club Adelaide University.

It is part of a variety of culinary traditions, including soul food and Pennsylvania Dutch cuisine, and is served in certain specialty restaurants in the United States.  Description  The chicken and waffle pairing comes from American soul food and uses fried chicken. The waffle is served as it would be for breakfast, with condiments such as butter and syrup. This combination of foods is beloved by many people who are influenced by traditions of soul food passed down from past generations of their families. This version of the dish is popular enough in Baltimore, Maryland, to become a local custom. The traditional Pennsylvania Dutch version consists of a plain waffle with pulled, stewed chicken on top, covered in gravy. It is generally found in the Northeastern United States. History Fried chicken and waffles The exact origins of this dish are unknown, although several theories about its origin exist. Waffles entered American cuisine in the 1600s with European colonists. The food's popularity saw a notable boost after 1789 with Thomas Jefferson's purchase of four waffle irons in Amsterdam. In the early 1800s, hotels and resorts outside Philadelphia served waffles with fried catfish. Such establishments also served other dishes like fried chicken, which gradually became the meat of choice due to catfish's limited, seasonal availability. Waffles served with chicken and gravy were noted as a common Sunday dish among the Pennsylvania Dutch by the 1860s. A 1901 memoir recalled a tavern in East Liberty, Pennsylvania, well known for \\"suppers of spring chickens and waffles.\\" By the end of the 19th century, the dish was a symbol of Pennsylvania Dutch Country, brought on in part by its association with tourism. By the 1840s, broiled chicken and waffles were the celebrated specialty at Warriner's Tavern in Springfield, Massachusetts, owned by \\"Uncle\\" Jeremy Warriner and his wife \\"Aunt\\" Phoebe, two well-known abolitionists. The expert cooks at Warriner's Tavern were African-American women, either freed or runaway slaves, who learned their trade in plantation house kitchens. Prior to the Civil War, chicken and waffles were extravagant breakfast staples in plantation houses through much of the South, prepared by the well-trained African-American cooks. In 1909, a Griswold's waffle iron advertisement promised, \\"You can attend a chicken and waffle supper right at home any time you have the notion if you are the owner of a Griswold's American Waffle Iron.\\" A traditional story about the origin of the dish in soul food states that because African Americans in the South rarely had the opportunity to eat chicken and were more familiar with flapjacks or pancakes than with waffles, they considered the dish a delicacy. For decades, it remained \\"a special- occasion meal in African American families.\\" Other historians, however, cite a scarcity of early evidence of the dish's existence in the South; they place the origin later, after the post-Civil War migration of Southern African- Americans to the North during the Reconstruction Era. The combination of chicken and waffles does not appear in early Southern cookbooks such as Mrs. Porter‚Äôs Southern Cookery Book, published in 1871, or in What Mrs. Fisher Knows About Old Southern Cooking, published in 1881 by former slave Abby Fisher. Fisher's cookbook is generally considered the first cookbook written by an African American. The lack of a recipe for the combination of chicken and waffles in Southern cookbooks from the era may suggest a later origin for the dish. Popular culture may have associated the dish with the South by 1917, when Edna Ferber's Fanny Herself mentioned a Chicago restaurant falsely advertising \\"Southern chicken dinner with waffles and real maple syrup, 35 cents each.\\" Fried chicken and waffles came to Los Angeles by 1931, when they were served at The Maryland, a restaurant that marketed the dish as a Southern specialty. James M. Cain's 1941 novel Mildred Pierce concerns a woman who finds success serving \\"chicken-and-waffle dinner\\" at her Glendale restaurant. In New York, the dish was served in the African-American community in Harlem as early as the 1930s in such locations as Tillie's Chicken Shack, Dickie Wells' jazz nightclub, and particularly the Wells Supper Club. In 1935 Bunny Berigan composed a jazz instrumental titled \\"Chicken and Waffles\\". Since the 1970s, chicken and waffles have regained popularity in Los Angeles due to the fame of former Harlem resident Herb Hudson's restaurant Roscoe's House of Chicken and Waffles, which has become known as a favorite of some Hollywood celebrities and been referenced in several movies.

Biography  Kl√©ber Dadjo was born in Siou on 12 August 1914. He was of the Nawde (or Losso) ethnic and linguistic group. Dadjo served in the British Army during World War II and in the French Army in the Indochina and Algerian conflicts. At the time of Togo's independence in 1960, he was the longest- serving and highest-ranking Togolese in the French Army. He held the rank of Captain and commanded Togo's tiny defence force, the Garde Togolaise. He was promoted to Major and eventually to Colonel after the 1963 coup d'√©tat and served as head of the military cabinet of President Nicolas Grunitzky. After the second military coup d'√©tat on 13 January 1967, Dadjo was named interim President of Togo (as Chairman of the Comit√© National de Reconciliation), a position that he held until 14 April 1967, when Lt.

People's Square, transfer station of Shanghai Metro An interchange station or a transfer station is a train station for more than one railway route in a public transport system that allows passengers to change from one route to another, often without having to leave a station or pay an additional fare. Transfer may occur within the same mode, or between rail modes, or to buses (for stations with bus termini attached). Such stations usually have more platforms than single route stations. These stations can exist in either commercial centers or on the city outskirts in residential areas. Cities typically plan for land use around interchange stations for development. Passengers may be required to pay extra fare for the interchange if they leave a paid area. History With the opening of the Woodside and Birkenhead Dock Street Tramway in 1873, Birkenhead Dock railway station in Birkenhead, England probably became the world's first tram to train interchange station.  Examples  The remains of the remote Verney Junction interchange station Verney Junction interchange station in Buckinghamshire, England was built at the point of two railway lines intersecting each other in open countryside. The station was built in an open remote field being used from 1868 to 1968. The Manhattan Transfer (PRR station) on the Pennsylvania Railroad was located outside Newark, New Jersey in a relatively isolated area, and was used primarily for passenger interchange. Sometimes cross-platform interchange is offered between mainline railways and city metro systems, such as Barking and Stratford stations in London. In some cases, no dedicated underground passage or footbridge is provided, and therefore passengers have to transfer between two parts of a station through city streets. Examples include Kuramae Station of Toei in Tokyo, Japan and Lexington Avenue-59th Street/Lexington Avenue‚Äì63rd Street stations in New York City. In many cases, electronic ticketing allows transferring passengers re-admission to the transit system without paying fare a second time, as if they had never left the fare control area in the station (this process is called a \\"free out-of-system transfer\\"). There are also bus interchanges, where people can change between different bus routes with no extra fare or only the differences of the fares of the two routes. Examples include Tai Lam Tunnel Bus Interchange and Shing Mun Tunnel Bus Interchange in the New Territories, Hong Kong, and in the downtown of Lafayette, Indiana.

Gifford Pinchot, at that time Chief Forester of the U.S., was the primary mover of the conference, and a progressive conservationist, who strongly believed in the scientific and efficient management of natural resources on the federal level. He was also a prime mover of the previous Inland Waterways Commission, which recommended such a meeting the previous October. On November 13, 1907, the President issued invitations to the governors of the States and Territories to meet at the White House on those dates.Recommendations, Inquiries in Progress, October 5, 1907: ...\\"3. We are of opinion that the conference may best be held in the national capital next winter, and that the conferees should comprise the governors of all our States and Territories, a limited number of delegates to be appointed by each governor, and representatives from leading organizations of both State and national scope engaged in dealing with natural resources or with practical questions relating thereto...

President Roosevelt delivered the opening address: \\"Conservation as a National Duty.\\"Theodore Roosevelt's Opening Address at the Conference Among those speaking were leading industrialists, such as Andrew Carnegie and James J. Hill, politicians, and resource experts. Their speeches emphasized both the nation's need to exploit renewable resources and the differing situations of the various states, requiring different plans. This Conference was a seminal event in the history of conservationism; it brought the issue to public attention in a highly visible way. The next year saw two outgrowths of the Conference: the National Conservation Commission, which Roosevelt and Pinchot set up with representatives from the states and Federal agencies, and the First National Conservation Congress, which Pinchot led as an assembly of private conservation interests. Among the attendees was Governor Newton C. Blanchard of Louisiana, whose term technically ended the day before the conference began.

It has a fast moving tidal deep water Channel not appropriate for swimming but is popular with beach anglers. The name Jumpinpin is a Yugambeh word meaning Pandanus root. The bar area is shallow for a kilometre or so offshore so current local knowledge is required to safely transit the bar. The area around the Pin is constantly changing with sand being deposited in one place after being moved by currents from another area. Just recently the mouth of Swan Bay was moved several hundred metres seaward creating an entirely new boating area. The area is not really suitable for swimming as big tides and fast currents are the norm. Inland from the bar the Pin area consists of mangroves and mud banks, constantly being built up and then being washed away. In recent years Rat Island, The Mud Clump and Squire Island have disappeared. Formation The Cambus Wallace. Jumpinpin, the narrow stretch of land on Stradbroke Island, circa 1890 before the seas broke through to create Jumpinpin Channel A channel in the general area of Jumpinpin may have formed and silted up several times over recent millennia, however, the most recent formation of the channel is generally blamed on two events. The first of these was the wreck of the Cambus Wallace, a 75 m steel barque of 1534 tonnes built in 1894 at Port Glasgow. In the early morning of 3 September 1894, the Cambus Wallace ran aground in heavy seas near what was then a narrow stretch of Stradbroke Island called Tuleen. Most of the crew managed to swim to shore, but six men drowned and were buried on the beach. The ship broke up where she struck and most of the cargo was washed ashore and plundered by local residents. During the subsequent cleanup, explosives from the cargo were piled up and deliberately detonated on the beach leaving large craters. The explosion is credited with severely damaging the beach and weakening the loosely vegetated sand dunes. Following gradual erosion of the seaward side of the island over the next two years, the second event to ultimately generate the channel at Jumpinpin was the arrival of a cyclone in 1896. Thomas Welsby, writing in 1921, noted, \\"Within two years (1896) the southeast gales threw again their power and fury on the very spot whereat the Cambus Wallace had come to grief, drove the rollers and breakers against the sandy hillside until it conquered and made passage into Swan Bay.\\"Welsby, T.

Effects of Late Storms. New Channel at Stradbroke. http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article176468895 Changes to tidal inundation in the area around the mouth of the Logan River were dramatic. Erosion occurred on farm land and some farmers resorted to building canals. The oyster industry in the area was also affected by what was claimed to be changes in the water density interfering with the ability of the oysters to settle on the seafloor. Fishing The 'Pin is renowned for fishing with huge catches of Bream, Flathead, Whiting, Luderick, Tailor and Trevally being made in season. Numerous Mulloway have been caught here. A few kilometres to the west of the bar an area known locally as Lew's Folly, produces large quantities of bream and flathead in season. Other areas known for their bream and flathead catches are Whalley's Gutter, Tiger Mullet Channel and Tree Gone Bay. Access is only by boat, however 4WD vehicles can access the southern tip of North Stradbroke Island, but the beach fishing is limited here.

In 1980, Mondavi sold 35 acres from his To Kalon Vineyard in the Oakville AVA to the joint venture that would serve as the backbone for the blend. The first vintage from this block was released in 1985 and soon the estate built the large limestone winery in Oakville that has become an icon of the Napa Valley.J.

It is a resident of the canopy and higher levels of damp tropical forests, but comes lower in adjacent semi-open areas. It nests high in an occupied termite nest or decaying tree trunk, with a typical clutch of three white or bluish-white eggs laid in a chamber reached by an ascending tunnel. Both sexes excavate the nesting chamber. Slaty-tailed trogons feed on insects and fruit, and their broad bills and weak legs reflect their diet and arboreal habits. Although their flight is fast, they are reluctant to fly any distance. They typically perch upright and motionless. Trogons have distinctive male and female plumages, with soft, often colourful, feathers. This species is about long and weighs . It has a uniformly dark grey tail, and the wing coverts also appear grey, although actually finely vermiculated in black and white.

Biography Janevska was born in Skopje (then SR Macedonia), Yugoslavia) where she currently works and lives. Her occupation is a violinist for the Macedonian National Opera. In addition to her musical talents, Andrijana also enjoys playing chess as a hobby. She is also proficient in playing the piano and her first composition was created at the age of 11. Andrijana started her studies in the School Centre for Music Education in Skopje at the age of 6, and recently finished her master studies at the Faculty of Arts in Skopje. Andrijana Janevska's talent was first exposed to the public in 1998, when she took part in SkopjeFest. In October the next year, Andrijana was voted the best newcomer in the annual Makfest festival in Stip. At the festival, she sang a sensual ballad called \\"Ne mozam da zaljubam po tebe\\" (\\"I Can't Fall in Love After You\\"). Her festival awards did not end there as she competed in the Macedonian festival, Eurofest, and achieved the respectable second place with the song \\"Da sum juzen vetar\\" (\\"To Be A Southern Wind\\"). In February 2000, Andrijana Jenevska competed in SkopjeFest once again, only this time she was competing for a Eurovision selection to compete in Stockholm, Sweden. At the festival, she sang the well received song called \\"Tvoeto pismo, moja biblija\\" (\\"Your Letter, My Bible\\") and with this composition, she had a huge hit in Macedonia despite her failure to win the competition. Andrijana's popularity led to her getting signed at the \\"Abra Kadabra\\" music label, which sent Andrijana to Cyprus to film her music video for her new single \\"Ljuboven ritam\\" (\\"Love Rhythm\\"), which she would compete with in the Montenegrin festival, Budva 2000. The cooperation between Andrijana and \\"Abra Kadabra\\" did not last long and finally ended when Andrijana terminated the agreement and joined the production of Macedonian Radio Television while continuing the direction of the music videos with another production label. During the summer of 2000, Andrijana spent her time in Australia as part of the Macedonian expedition to other continents. In October, Andrijana participated in Makfest as part of a duet with Marjan Stojanovski for the song \\"Ljubov ti e adresa\\" (\\"Love Is Your Address\\"). The song became a hit among the public and with their votes, the song triumphed in first place. After this, Andrijana filmed her music video with Stojanovski and returned to her first ambition of playing the violin, which was evident in her new songs. On March 2001, with the hit \\"Nostalgija\\" (\\"Nostalgia\\") Andrijana got first place from the public, first place from the jury, and the festival's Grand-Prix at SkopjeFest. In July, Andrijana took part in the Muf + Boban 2001 festival in Zrenjanin and began her promotion for the new album \\"Moja Biblija\\", which contained some new and some old songs, 12 of which were included in the album. Andrijana's fondness of duets made her dedicate the song, \\"Odovde do vechnosta\\" (\\"From Here to Eternity\\") which she sang with opera singer Blagoj Nacoski, to her fans. Andrijana Janevska competed in SkopjeFest 2002, this time wishing to reach the Eurovision stage in Tallinn, Estonia. Her song \\"O Cherie, Mon Cherie\\" was a strong favourite to win the competition, however the audience and the jury both placed Andrijana in second place. After this, Andrijana took a long break from the music scene. After three years of absence, Andrijana Janevska returned to the Macedonian music scene in October, participating in Makfest 2004. She competed with the rock song \\"Ostani\\" (\\"Stay\\"), and placed 7th. Andrijana Janevska was later interviewed and revealed that she is trying new music styles and that she is currently focused on rock music. At the end of 2004, Andrijana participated in SkopjeFest with \\"Za Kraj\\" (\\"For The End\\"), which because of its immense popularity was later released as a single with a music video. Andrijana announced that she will release a new album in the near future and that she has songs already prepared for promotion. In the summer of 2005, Andrijana participated in Ohrid Fest with the song \\"Dojdi Bakni Me\\" (\\"Come And Kiss Me\\"), where she won the third place overall. After that, Andrijana continued her comeback participating again in Makfest 2005, with the song \\"Zvezda Vodilka\\" (\\"Guiding Star\\"), where she was successful at gaining more media interest. In 2006, Andrijana revealed that she will record some songs in the reggae style of music. In June, she released her new reggae single called \\"Den\\" (\\"Day\\"). Andrijana confirmed that she would participate in this year's Ohrid Fest. Andrijana performed \\"Sonce\\" (\\"Sun\\") during the Pop music night of Ohrid Fest on August 25. She got sufficient points to proceed to the International evening where she was successful although not placing in the top 3. In addition to competing, Andrijana had also promoted her upcoming album called \\"Den\\". It was recently revealed that Andrijana had recorded a song with Eva Nedinkoska called \\"Tivka Nok\\" (\\"Quiet Night\\"), which will is due to be released along with a videoclip. Andrijana Janevska made a return to the Skopje Fest contest, which took place on February 24, 2007. The contest acted as the National Final of Macedonia for the Eurovision Song Contest. In 2009 the follow-up of the CD with traditional Macedonian songs titled \\"Prikazna za edno mome\\" (\\"Story for one Sheila\\") was released and once again it was produced by Mite Dimovski. The following year in collaboration with MED Macedonia, she released the Christian CD with Christmas songs for children titled \\"Dzvezdichka mala\\" (\\"Little Star\\"). In 2011 in collaboration with Tanja Veda she released the children's CD \\"Koga si srekjen\\" (\\"When you are happy\\") that contains 15 songs from the English speaking regions, translated and sang in Macedonian. In 2009, Janevska married guitarist of the band Archangel, Dragan Ginovski Gino, who she had been dating for 4 years. In 2011 she became mother of little Dimitar, and the following year she returned onstage with the appearance at the Skopje Festival where she performed the composition ‚ÄúMozebi‚Äù (‚ÄúMaybe‚Äù). Andrijana is the author of the music, text and arrangement of this song. She was full-time professor teaching violin for two years in the music school in Kumanovo, she was teaching for one year at the University of Audiovisual Arts European Film and Theatre Academy ESRA- Paris-Skopje-New York, almost 7 years she is teaching solfeggio, theory of music, singing and piano in the musical school ‚ÄúEnterprajz‚Äù and since 2003 Janevska has been an active member of the women's chamber choir \\"St. Zlata Meglenska\\". Janevska is a professor in the music department at the Faculty of Music Arts in Skopje, as well as a composer. Though she has written many of the songs she sings, she also sings works by other composers. In 2014, Janevska performed at the World Choir Competition in Riga, winning two gold and one silver medal with the St. Zlata Meglenska Choir. Their choir, the only one from Macedonia was among 570 competing international singing groups. That same year, she and her husband had their second son. Her biggest hobby is playing chess and she was a spokesperson for the Chess Federation of the Republic of Macedonia for one year, as a member of the chess club \\"Gambit\\".

When the park was created in 1941, it constituted one of the largest protected wilderness areas in Canada. In the early 1960s, the provincial government reduced its size by 98% due to pressure exerted by the forestry industry, planned hydroelectric developments along the upper Columbia River and the re-routing of the Trans-Canada Highway away from the park. History Established on 16 September 1941 by an Order in Council issued by British Columbia premier Thomas Dufferin Pattullo, the park was named in honour of Eric W. Hamber, Lieutenant-Governor of British Columbia from 1936 to 1941.Bradley 2011, p. 89. Covering approximately 1,009,112 hectares at the time of its establishment, it was one of the largest parks in Canada.Sandford 2010, p. 201. It shared a common boundary with portions of Mount Robson Provincial Park and Jasper, Banff, Glacier and Yoho National Parks. Designated a \\"Class A\\" provincial park, it afforded the \\"highest degree of protection from exploitation\\" to a vast tract of wilderness in the Selkirk Mountains and the western ranges of the Rocky Mountains. Pattullo established Hamber as a new protected area which bridged the gap between several existing mountain parks in the hope that his action would spur the Canadian government to declare Hamber a new national park. He envisioned that a substantial increase in the national park system's coverage of western Canada's mountainous terrain would boost tourism revenue. Part of this economic benefit was anticipated to derive from improved access to the region made possible by federal support for road infrastructure within a nationalized Hamber park. The Canadian federal government, whose attention was directed towards World War II, expressed little interest in Pattullo's idea. Moreover, Prime Minister Mackenzie King preferred that national parks be spread throughout the country and not be concentrated only in the mountains of western Canada. No portion of Hamber was ever incorporated into Canada's national park system.Bradley 2011, p. 93. Within the park's protected boundaries were extensive stands of commercially valuable timber. Sawmills and logging companies based in Revelstoke and Golden lobbied the provincial government to allow exploitation of Hamber's timber resources. They argued that Hamber's existence as a protected area was stifling the region's forestry-based economy.Bradley 2011, p. 94. The provincial government redesignated Hamber as a \\"Class B\\" provincial park in 1945. Commercial logging and mining were permitted in parks given this designation. Hamber remained undeveloped throughout the 1940s and 1950s. No tourist resorts, campgrounds, trails or scenic lookouts were constructed within the park even though a considerable section of the highway which in 1962 would be officially designated the Trans-Canada passed through it. By the late 1950s it had become clear through negotiations with the United States which would ultimately lead to the Columbia River Treaty that hydroelectric dam projects would be constructed along the upper Columbia River. One of these planned projects, Mica Dam, would result in substantial environmental disruptions within the park's boundaries caused by the flooding of the Columbia River valley above the dam. Because the highway followed this valley between Revelstoke and Golden, it had to be re-routed through Roger's Pass before the dam could be built and thereby bypassed Hamber almost entirely. In light of these circumstances, provincial officials concluded that the park no longer had a legitimate reason to exist in its current form. In 1961 and 1962 the British Columbia government redrew the park's boundaries. Most of the park was deleted, except for a rump centered on Fortress Lake in a remote part of the western ranges of the Rocky Mountains. The new Hamber Provincial Park consists of only 24,518 hectares, a reduction of 98% relative to its original size.Bradley 2011, pp. 95-97.Sandford 2010, p. 202. World Heritage Site In 1990 this park was included within the Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks UNESCO World Heritage Site. Together with the other national and provincial parks that comprise the Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks, the park was recognized for its natural environment and the geological and ecological significance of its mountain landscapes containing the habitats of rare and endangered species, mountain peaks, glaciers, lakes, waterfalls, canyons and limestone caves and fossils. Conservation Vegetation around Fortress Lake is replete with spruce and balsam, consisting of a heavy understory of false azalea and rhododendron. Recreation Back country camping and hiking. Fishing for brook trout in Fortress Lake. Cross country skiing and snowshoeing in the winter. There are climbing opportunities as well. Location As a remote wilderness area, no roads traverse the park. A commercial fly-in fishing camp operates on Chisel Creek Fan on the shore of Fortress Lake during the summer months. The only other means of access are via hike-in or ski-in. Park at the Sunwapta Falls parking lot in Jasper National Park. It is a 22 km hike over trails to Fortress Lake. The closest communities to the park are Mica Creek, British Columbia and Jasper, Alberta.

Tiongson is a leading critic, creative writer and academic from the Philippines. He holds a Bachelor of Humanities degree from the Ateneo de Manila University, and M.A. and Ph.D. in Philippine Studies from the University of the Philippines. A founding member of the Manunuri ng Pelikulang Pilipino, Tiongson is currently Professor Emeritus of Film and Audio-visual Communication at the College of Mass Communication in U.P. Diliman. Tiongson was a Visiting Professor at Osaka University of Foreign Studies in Japan; and Fulbright Visiting Professor at the University of California, Berkeley; University of Michigan; University of California, Los Angeles; and University of Hawaii at Manoa. Tiongson also received an Australian Cultural Award for his extensive research on Philippine culture, resulting in two pioneering works on Philippine drama: Kasaysayan at Estetika ng Sinakulo at Ibang Dulang Panrelihiyon sa Malolos and Kasaysayan ng Komedya sa Pilipinas. Tiongson was vice-president and artistic director of the Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP) from 1986 to 1994. He conceptualized a new direction for the CCP, in 1986, and subsequently authored a comprehensive cultural development plan that has broadened the scope of the CCP Outreach Programs nationwide. He paved the way to give more opportunities and recognition for regional artists and arts organizations through productions, conferences, forum-lectures, publication and research. He continuously writes history and criticisms about local arts and culture that serve as reference materials of scholars, researchers, academicians, and students of the present generation. Tiongson was also the Philippine Director of Sangandaan 2003, a cultural commemoration that highlighted the arts and media produced by Filipinos, Americans and Filipino- Americans in the course of Philippine-U.S. relations from 1899 to 2002. The cultural events were commemorated in the Philippines on July 6‚Äì30, 2003 under the sponsorship of the University of the Philippines, the Cultural Center of the Philippines and the San Francisco State University, in collaboration with numerous public and private institutions in the Philippines such as the National Commission for Culture and the Arts, the National Historical Institute, the National Library, the National Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Manila, Ateneo de Manila University, and De La Salle University-Manila, and in the United States such as the City College of San Francisco, and the University of San Francisco. During his short term as Director of the Movie and Television Review and Classification Board (MTRCB), Tiongson played an important role in the controversy surrounding a film popularly known as Live Show. The film, directed by Jose Javier Reyes, focused on performing women and men who engaged in sex acts onstage at some night clubs in the Manila area. The film was accepted for exhibition at the prestigious Berlin Film Festival. On March 22, 2001, the Philippine Daily Inquirer noted: \\"Reyes believed the film illustrated the depressing lives of people forced through poverty to engage in the sex trade.\\" Live Show was banned after Cardinal Archbishop Jaime Sin of Manila denounced the film and labeled it \\"immoral\\" and \\"in violation of the campaign for moral reform.\\" Tiongson resigned shortly after Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo banned Live Show, and noted his conviction that the President had been pressured by influential Filipino members of the Catholic Church. Tiongson has taught Philippine literature, theater, and general culture at the University of the Philippines, the Ateneo de Manila University, De La Salle University-Manila, the University of Hawaii and the Osaka University of Foreign Studies. He also taught Filipino and Philippine literature at the College of Arts and Letters, University of the Philippines from 1974 to 1986. Among the books he edited are: The Cultural Traditional Media of ASEAN, The Urian Anthology, the Politics of Culture: The Philippine Experience, Tuklas Sining, and the 10-volume CCP Encyclopedia of Philippine Art. For his publications, he has received five National Book Awards from the Manila Critics Circle and two Surian ng Wikang Pambansa awards. Tiongson was widely criticized among artist's circle for his opposition to the proposal of bestowing the National Artist honor to the late Dolphy.http://stuartsantiago.com/peque-gallaga-on-dolphy-the-artist/ The incident was vividly recalled by National Artist for Theater Cecilia Guidote- Alvarez wherein Tiongson \\"stood violently\\" and protested passionately on the proposal. Tiongson admitted that he had reservations on the installation of Dolphy with the prestigious award.http://www.abs- cbnnews.com/lifestyle/07/10/12/tiongson-clarifies-comments-dolphy Tiongson wrote: ‚ÄúI believed that the two icons he created for film and TV ‚Äì the screaming gay and the happy-go-lucky poor man ‚Äì have, in the majority of his movies, equated gayness with abnormality and mindless frivolity on the one hand, and romanticized or deodorized poverty on the other.‚Äù Works Books =Political, Social and Cultural Studies= *Four values in Filipino Drama and Film *The Cultural Traditional Media of ASEAN *The Urian Anthology, 1970-1979, 1980 *Kasaysayan ng Komedya sa Pilipinas, 1766-1982, 1982 *Politics of Culture: The Philippine Experience, 1985 *Tuklas Sining: Essays on Philippine Arts, 1992 *Philippine Theater: A History and Anthology.

The ky≈çiku mama is a stereotyped figure in modern Japanese society portrayed as a mother who relentlessly drives her child to study, to the detriment of the child's social and physical development, and emotional well- being.Kriman, Alfred. \\"SBF Glossary: Jo. to J-2\\". 10/25/07 The ky≈çiku mama is one of the best-known and least-liked pop-culture figures in contemporary Japan. The ky≈çiku mama is analogous to American stereotypes such as the stage mother who forces her child to achieve show-business success in Hollywood, the stereotypical Chinese tiger mother who takes an enormous amount of effort to direct much of her maternal influence towards developing their children's educational and intellectual achievement, and the Jewish mother's drive for her children to succeed academically and professionally, resulting in a push for perfection and a continual dissatisfaction with anything less or the critical, self-sacrificing mother who coerces her child into medical school or law school. The stereotype is that a ky≈çiku mama is feared by her children, blamed by the press for school phobias and youth suicides, and envied and resented by the mothers of children who study less and fare less well on exams.Tobin, Joseph J., David Y.H. Wu, and Dana Davidson. Preschool in Three Cultures: Japan, China and the United States. New Haven, Conn.: Yale University Press, 1989.White, Merry I. Perfectly Japanese: Making Families in an Era of Upheaval. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2002. Factors influencing development of ky≈çiku mama In the early 1960s, part-time women's labor began at a few major corporations in Japan and was adopted by other companies within a decade. It became popular among married women in the 1970s and even more so by 1985. Women's return to the workplace is often explained two-fold: by financial demands to complement the family budget, and by psychological demands to relate themselves to society. Child-rearing women in the 1960s inspired the media to produce the idiom ky≈çiku mama, which referred to \\"the domestic counterpart of sararii-man\\" (salaryman). This encompassed a major responsibility to \\"rear children, especially the males, to successfully pass the competitive tests needed to enter high school and college\\".Kato, Etsuko. The Tea Ceremony and Women's Empowerment in Modern Japan: Bodies Re- presenting the Past. London: Routledge, 2004. No such idiom emerged that deemed men \\"education papas\\"; it was \\"mamas\\" who became a social phenomenon. The education system The education system and larger political economy it serves influence why mothers become obsessed with children's education. Social prejudices influence media stereotypes of ky≈çiku mamas that blame women rather than political conditions. Getting a good, steady job in the future very much depends on getting into a good university, which depends on attaining high scores on the national university exams in a student's last year of high school. Ordinary people, including mothers, feel powerless to change this system. As a result, there is a clear map pointing students to the right nursery school that leads to the right kindergarten, the best elementary school, junior high school, and high school, all of which may be associated with prestigious universities. To ensure these results, some parents have been known to commit unethical or illegal acts to promote their child's success. In one case, a restaurant owner paid a $95,000 bribe in an attempt to get his child enrolled in Aoyama Gakuin, a prestigious kindergarten for children who are three or four years old. Because of the kindergarten's affiliation with an elite university, parents are willing to go to extreme lengths to get their children enrolled. Aoyama Gakuin has room for 40 new students a year. Every year, it receives more than 2000 hopeful applicants. The tests the potential students take are known to be extremely difficult.Hills, Ben. Japan Behind the Lines. Rydalmere, New South Wales: Hodder Headline Australia Pty Limited, 1996. The issue is compounded by the notion that most important job positions in business and government are held by graduates of the University of Tokyo. In addition, which university a student attends is believed to affect one's choices for a future spouse. Because a child's life appears to be determined by what schools he or she attends, many mothers take extraordinary measures to get children into good schools.Collins, Robert J. Japan-think, Ameri-think: An Irreverent Guide to Understanding the Cultural Differences Between Us. New York: Penguin Books, 1992. Changing family structures The older generation of Japanese grew up in larger households than those normally found in Japan today. Back then, ikuji (, \\"child-raising\\") included a larger surrounding environment, made up of more relatives and extended family, and more children: siblings and cousins. Children who grew up in that time learned responsibilities through the care of younger siblings. These children relied on themselves in the outside world through much of their childhood lives. In those days, child-raising was more of a private matter, handled only by the child's surrounding family. In the 1970s, men's wages decreased and women left home earlier to find jobs. These women \\"considered themselves free\\" after the child's junior high education. The previous generation did not feel this until after the child had finished high school.Ochiai, Emiko. The Japanese Family System in Transition. Tokyo: Yoshikaku Publishing Co., 1994. In contemporary Japan, couples are having fewer children and teaching the children self- reliance. This involves consulting child-raising professionals. This new need in professional advice is commonly termed \\"child-raising neurosis\\" by professionals. Reliance on professionals has largely created a new generation of young mothers with low self-confidence in their child-raising abilities. Indeed, most Japanese mothers today grew up in smaller families with only one or two children. Their mothers provided them with everything they needed and gave them little to no responsibilities involving their siblings. Thus, that generation of children has grown up to become mothers who have no idea how to raise their children. In addition, in contemporary Japan there are mothers who completely devote themselves to child-raising. Another subtype, described by Nishioka Rice, is the kosodate mama (), who adds psychosociological elements into child-raising. In addition to providing for her a good education, she develops an emotional and psychological relationship with her children. One way to do this is through \\"skinship\\"‚Äîbeing in constant close physical contact with her children. This could, for example, involve carrying her child on her back wherever she goes or bathing with her children every night. Through skinship, ittaikan () is achieved, a \\"one-ness and balanced, positively valenced dependency\\" between mother and child. Societal views In Japan, a mother who works is commonly seen as selfish in a society where child- raising is linked directly with the physical closeness between mother and child. This emphasis can be a cause of the development of a ky≈çiku mama who always worries about her children's education success. This produces children that society views as lacking self-reliance, antisocial, and selfish. When compared to American mothers, Japanese mothers have a stronger belief in effort as opposed to innate ability. Japanese children see their efforts as necessary to fulfill a social obligation to family, peers, and community. Children are forced to focus on their effort, seeing it as the cause of success. According to society, if a child does not succeed, they were not trying hard enough. This is unrelated to the child's grades; children always need to put forth more effort.Elliot, Julian. Bempechat, Janine. Learning in Culture and Context. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass, 2002 Mothers pressure children because they are held strongly accountable for their children's actions.Elliot, Julian. Bempechat, Janine. Learning in Culture and Context. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass, 2002. It is very hard to find daycare in some parts of Japan, and it is socially looked down upon if a mother sends her child to one. The mother is seen as insufficient, not having the skills to raise a child on her own, or selfish, giving her child over to a caretaker while she pursues her own separate goals. The term ky≈çiku mama became used in other similar contexts. For example, the former Ministry of International Trade and Industry was dubbed ky≈çiku mama for its approach and initiatives in guiding industrial growth,Vogel, Ezra, Japan as Number One, Harvard University Press, 1979, p. 70 in a manner similar to the definition of a nanny state. Media Housewives are surrounded by popular media that encourages their actions. Daytime television, magazines, products, and services for mothers are largely focused on improving the home and raising the children. Thus, the job of motherhood is taken very seriously by mothers in Japan. A common description of a mother's free time is ‚Äúthree meals and a nap.‚Äù Class distinctions Ky≈çiku mamas, preparatory preschools, and heavily academic curricula exist in Japan, yet they are relatively rare and concentrated in urban, wealthy areas. Ky≈çiku mamas are prominent in the middle classes. Middle-class women train the children, the next generation of the middle class. In a speech at the 1909 Mitsukoshi children's exhibition, First Higher School principal Nitobe Inaz≈ç asserted, \\"The education of a citizenry begins not with the infant but with the education of a country's mothers.\\" In the post-World War II era in Japan, the mother was the creator of a new child- centered world stamped with middle-class values. The mother was linked with the success of the child's education. A woman was expected to be a \\"good wife, wise mother\\" and became the single most important figure in raising the child to become a successful future adult. Mothers needed to put their efforts into raising and teaching their children. Through self-cultivation and rearing of the children, the woman was crucial to a family's ability to claim a place in the so-called middle stratum. As education credentials became the recognized prerequisite to social advancement in the early 20th century, ky≈çiku mama actively looked to the education system, especially admission into middle school for boys and higher school for girls, to help improve the family's social position. The competition to pass the entrance examination to middle school and girls' higher school became intense, creating the social phenomenon known as shiken jigoku (): examination hell. While risshin shusse (), or rising in the world, was the clarion call of the mass of the middle class, there was no risshin shusse without a ky≈çiku mama. For the education mother, making the child into a superior student was a concern that began with the child's entrance into elementary school at age six and extended to all aspects of the child's education.Jones, Mark Alan. Children as treasures: Childhood and the middle class in early twentieth-century Japan. Diss. Columbia University, 2001. ProQuest Digital Dissertations. ProQuest. University of Texas at Austin Libraries 30 October 2007 Working-class mothers are not as intensely active in their children's education as middle-class mothers. An ethnographic study by Shimizu Tokuda (1991) portrayed one middle school that faced persistent academic problems in a working-class neighborhood of Osaka. The study illustrated efforts by teachers to improve the student's academic performance: providing tests, promoting monthly teacher discussions, painting walls to enhance the study environment, and restricting hours spent in extracurricular activities. While students' enrollment in high school slightly improved, academic achievement level remained lower than the national average. This study revealed that students' academic problems were deeply related to their home environments. Most students had parents who were uneducated and not involved in their children's education.Yamamoto, Yoko. Unequal beginnings: Socioeconomic differences in Japanese mothers' support of their children's early schooling. Diss. University of California, Berkeley, 2006. ProQuest Digital Dissertations. ProQuest. University of Texas at Austin Libraries 30 October 2007 American view In contrast to Japan's mostly negative images of ky≈çiku mamas, American leaders who put forth the image of \\"superhuman Japan\\" to boost American education performance extolled Japan's education- minded mothers. Both of Ronald Reagan's education secretaries focused attention on Japanese mothers as mirrors to improve American families and schools. Reagan's first Secretary of Education, Terrel Bell (credited for the wording of A Nation at Risk) wrote an enthusiastic foreword to Guy Odom's Mothers, Leadership and Success‚Äîa book whose basic point was that only vigorous, aggressive and intelligent Super Moms exemplified by Japanese mothers could reinvigorate America. William J. Bennett, head of the Department of Education in Reagan's second term, praised Japan's \\"one parent on the scene\\" who \\"stays in touch with the teachers, supervises the homework, arranges extra instructional help if needed, and buttresses the child's motivation to do well in school and beyond\\".Thorsten, Marie. Superhuman Japan: Nation, Knowledge and Culture in US-Japan Relations. Routledge, 2012. Contemporary ky≈çiku mamas Many Japanese mothers dedicate much time to get their children from one entrance exam to another. At the national university entrance exams, held in Tokyo, most mothers travel with their children to the examination hall. They arrive and stay at a nearby hotel, grilling their children on last-minute statistics and making sure that they are not late to the exam.Joseph, Joe. The Japanese: Strange But Not Strangers. London: Viking, 1993. Some mothers are beginning their children's education at even younger ages. A 30-year-old mother in Japan says, \\"This is my first baby, and I didn't know how to play with her or help her develop\\". She sends her 6-month-old daughter to a pre-pre-school in Tokyo. A headmaster at another pre-pre-school claims that the school, for children one year or older, helps to nurture and develop the children's curiosity through \\"tangerine-peeling or collecting and coloring snow\\". Mothers are essentially in heavy competition with other mothers who want their children to get into the elite universities. In some cases, to make it seem like her own child is not studying as much, mothers will let their child use the parents' bedroom to study while the mothers watch television in the living room. Other mothers who pass by the house will see the child's bedroom light off, assuming that the child has shirked his or her studies to watch television. The next morning, the mother will report what happened on the shows to her child, who will go to school and talk about it to his or her classmates, who will also assume that their friend is a slacker, lowering their expectations of their friend and for themselves. However, when examination time rolls around, the \\"slacker\\" will be admitted into an elite school while his or her friends will drop behind. Ky≈çiku mamas often give their children a big first appearance in the neighborhood through a k≈çen deby≈´ (), where the mothers \\"parade their offspring around the neighborhood parks for approval\\". Mothers send their children to cram schools (juku), where children may stay until 10 or 11pm. Japan has over 35,000 cram schools for college examinations. In addition to cram schools, children are sent to calligraphy, keyboard, abacus, or kendo classes. As revealed by Marie Thorsten, moral panics about juku and education mamas occurred at the same time, in the 1970s. \\"As 'second schools', the juku, as consumer services, appealed to mothers‚Äô anxieties about their children, shaping the image of the 'normal' mother as one who sends her children to juku and stays up to date with commercialized trends in examination preparation.\\"Thorsten, Marie. Superhuman Japan. Routledge, 2012. Effects on children In the 1950s, full- time mothers devoted themselves to a smaller number of children. Parental stress resulted in the commonality of new childhood problems; these include bronchial asthma, stammering, poor appetite, proneness to bone fractures, and school phobia. Children were aware they were their mother's purpose in life. Mothers played the role of their children's school teachers while they were at home.Ochiai, Emiko. The Japanese Family System in Transition. Tokyo: Yoshikaku Publishing Co., 1994. Sometimes, a child who grows up with a ky≈çiku mama turns into a tenuki okusan (, \\"hands-off housewife\\"). This stereotype describes women who typically have jobs and are not around the children as much, essentially becoming the female version of the stereotypical absent Japanese father, a \\"leisure-time parent\\" or \\"Sunday friend\\". These mothers are said to not do a lot of homemaking, commonly making large, freezable meals that are easy to reheat in case they are not home or too busy to do the cooking. They do not attempt to represent their families in the community through participation in their children's school PTA and other community functions. Compared to modern American children, Japanese youths have less drug use, depression, violence, and teenage pregnancy, although these may be caused due to harsher laws and intrinsic social values in the Japanese culture. Government regulations The Japanese Ministry of Education has admitted that the education system and parental pressure are taking their toll on children. Education reforms that the Ministry of Education has enacted beginning in the 1970s have challenged Japan's egalitarian school system. To decrease academic pressure among students from examination competition, the Ministry of Education cut school hours and increased non-academic activities such as recess and clubs in elementary and junior high schools.Yamamoto, Yoko. Unequal beginnings: Socioeconomic differences in Japanese mothers' support of their children's early schooling. Diss. University of California, Berkeley, 2006. ProQuest Digital Dissertations. ProQuest. University of Texas at Austin Libraries 30 Oct. 2007 In 2002, the central government reduced school hours again, decreased content, and introduced a new curriculum at all public elementary schools to encourage individual students' learning interests and motivation. The Japanese Ministry of Education published a white paper stating that children do not have opportunities such as \\"coming into contact with nature, feeling awe and respect for life, and experiencing the importance of hard work learning from difficulties\\". Japanese education and related stress Post-war Japan in the 1950s made it a \\"national mission to accelerate its education program. Children of this era had to distinguish themselves from peers at an early age if they hoped to get into a top university. Entrance exams for these children began in kindergarten.Nathan, Jonathan. Japan Unbound. New York: Houghton Mifflin Company, 2004. By the mid-1970s, pressure to achieve in children created the need for specialty schools. Seventy percent of students continued their long school day at juku or \\"cram schools\\". In the 1980s, a series of suicides linked to school pressures began. Elementary and middle school students took their lives after failing entrance exams. During the 1990s, the economic collapse in Japan (after its global economic dominance in the previous decade) led to a loss of motivation by students. The once highly touted academic ratings of Japan in math and science fell behind those of American levels. The stress began to lead to classroom disruption. In 2001, the National Education Research Institute found that 33 percent of teachers and principals polled said that they had witnessed a complete breakdown of class \\"over a continuous period\\" due to defiant children \\"engaging in arbitrary activity\\". In 2002, the Japanese Education Ministry ‚Äî pressured by the need to reform ‚Äî eliminated 30 percent of its core curriculum. This freed up time for students to learn in groups according to the students' chosen path. The use of the term mukatsuku, meaning \\"irritating and troublesome\\", has been rising in use among students as a description of the feelings they experience of being fed up with teachers, parents, and life.

History The passes through what is now the park were used by the Kootenai Indians and by mid-19th-century European explorers. Two archaeological sites over 8,000 years old have been identified on the Middle Fork of the White River. A national park was proposed early in the 20th century. In 1936 the White River Game Reserve was established. However, construction of logging roads and clearcutting became so extensive in the Southern Canadian Rockies that by 1986, the area that is now the park had become the last major refuge for wildlife in the region. Two provincial environmental organisations, BC Spaces for Nature and the Palliser Wilderness Society, with guide outfitter Hiram Cody Tegart, led a campaign to protect it permanently by making it a wilderness park, and in 1987, after a twelve-year process of negotiation between government, conservationists, hunting guides and outfitters, and logging companies, it became the first Forest Wilderness Area in British Columbia.Jeremy Wilson, Talk and Log: Wilderness Politics in British Columbia, Vancouver: University of British Columbia, 1998, , p. 250 and note 55, pp. 399-400.Rich Landers, \\"Elk Beyond the Bootprints: A hunter's primer to Northwest Wilderness Areas\\", Field & Stream Far West edition, n.d., pp. 78-79, p. 79.Karsten Heuer, Walking the Big Wild: From Yellowstone to the Yukon on the Grizzly Bears' Trail, Toronto: McClelland & Stewart, 2002, repr.

A vertical drop in Riverbend cave at Horne Lake, part of an adventure caving tour Horne Lake Caves Provincial Park is a provincial park on Vancouver Island in British Columbia, Canada. Its principal function is the protection, management, and recreational use of several caves collectively known as the Horne Lake Caves. History Although certainly known to natives, the first reference to caves at Horne Lake is in a geological report from 1912. Two caves known as Main and Lower Main were thereafter known to loggers, and public visitation increased after they were publicised in 1939. In 1941 the larger Riverbend Cave was discovered and was a popular tourist site by 1945. In 1957 the Province placed a 29 ha reserve around the Horne Lake caves which by then had been stripped of many of their formations. Fears of vandalism in the recently revealed Euclataws Cave (discovered in 1963 but kept secret until about 1969) led local cavers to approach the provincial government for protection, and in February 1971 Horne Lake Caves became a provincial park. Euclataws and Riverbend Cave were gated and guided tours commenced in Main, Lower Main and Riverbend caves. Vandalism and gate-breaching continued, however, and in 1984 a serious incident of vandalism in Riverbend Cave led to increased attention and the creation of a management plan in 1985, followed by improved visitor facilities and privately managed cave tours. Four additional caves, Cougar Cave, Eggshell Cave, Andre's Annex and Riverbend Trail Slot Cave, have recently been documented within the park. The park includes forest and part of the Qualicum River which provides opportunities for hiking, fishing and canoeing.

On December 29, 2006, Zero Corporation sold its consumer division to ACE Co., Ltd., a Japanese luggage manufacturer. Today, Zero Halliburton is a wholly owned subsidiary of ACE Co., Ltd., of Osaka and Tokyo. Erle P. Halliburton, the American founder of Halliburton, had commissioned the aluminium case in 1938 from aircraft engineers because other luggage could not endure the rough travel through Texas oil fields. In addition to being more durable than a leather or cloth case due to its rigidity, the aluminium case seals tightly against dust and water. The aluminium cases have appeared in over 200 Hollywood movies and television shows, often as a MacGuffin. In addition to aluminium, Zero Halliburton cases have been available in carbon fiber, polycarbonate, polypropylene, and Texalium (an aluminium-coated fiberglass). Famously, the nuclear football, the briefcase which the President of the United States can use to order a nuclear strike, is a modified Zero Halliburton case, although enclosed in a black leather 'jacket' to make it appear less militaristic in diplomatic situations.

History The Chilcotin Region began its history of agricultural settlements just as the Cariboo Gold Rush was waning in the 1860s. Two of the earliest ranches in this area were the Cotton and Deer Park Ranches, now amalgamated as Riske Creek Ranching. Settlement followed the accessible bunchgrass ranges along the terraces of the Chilcotin River between 1873 and 1893, and ranges have been used for livestock grazing since 1873. There is also historical evidence of mining in the area; remnants of old Chinese placer mining activities have been found at the confluence of the Fraser and Chilcotin Rivers. In 1973, a 4,573 hectare Wildlife Reserve, managed by the Fish and Wildlife Branch, was established to protect the bighorn sheep and their natural grassland habitat. This reserve was designated as the Junction Wildlife Management Area in 1987, and was designated a provincial park in 1995. Conservation The area protects critical breeding, lambing, and winter range of the largest population of non-migratory California bighorn sheep in the world, a blue-listed species. Approximately 500 bighorn sheep live in the area, feeding on bunchgrass and other low growing plants, and finding refuge from predators in the steep breaks at the edges of grassland benches. In the past, the Junction California bighorn sheep have also provided a source of sheep for transplants to other areas of North America where the sheep had been extirpated. Recreation The following recreational activities are available: horseback riding and hunting. There is no camping allowed within the park. The park is only open to the public during hunting season. Location Located 60 kilometres south of Williams Lake, British Columbia. Access to the park is difficult, via rough 4 x 4 dirt roads through private ranchlands. Size 4,573 hectares in size.

The park was established on April 4, 1996 by combining three former parks - China Beach, Loss Creek, and Botanical Beach - into one provincial park. It is the location of the majority of the Juan de Fuca Marine Trail, which is a southern compliment to the West Coast Trail within Pacific Rim National Park Reserve. History The region was recognized as biologically significant, and Josephine Tilden of the University of Minnesota installed the first marine research station in the Pacific Northwest at Botanical Beach in 1901. The University of Minnesota maintained a research station here for five years, but they left in 1906. Conway MacMillan resigned from the University of Minnesota after the university refused to take ownership of land in a different country. After the departure of the University of Minnesota, the University of British Columbia, University of Washington, Simon Fraser University, and the University of Victoria have done research in the area. Prior to the establishment, there were several parks in the area protecting what is now within the boundaries of the park. Former parks Loss Creek Provincial Park was a Class A park established on June 29, 1959 at the bridge over the creek of the same name. It was the smallest and least developed of the three parks. China Beach Provincial Park was a Class A park established on January 4, 1967. It was the best developed of the three former parks, featuring a day-use area and vehicle-accessible campground. The park's creation came about in a trade between the provincial government and a forestry company. By allowing logging in the Bedwell Valley of Strathcona Provincial Park the company agreed to hand over the land for China Beach. Botanical Beach Provincial Park was a Class A park established in 1989. It was the largest of the three former parks. At the time of creation, the park was 76% natural environment, with plans for complete restoration of the entire park. This included of land and of foreshore. The park was established to encourage education and research in the area. A nature reserve was established in 1961, and expanded in 1966 to include and of shoreline. The initial proposal for the park was investigated in 1981, with the final park was established in 1989 as a Class A park. Access to the park has been possible by the current gravel road since prior to its establishment. Consolidation On April 4, 1996, BC Parks consolidated all three former parks into a single larger park named Juan de Fuca Provincial Park. The new park also included the locally popular and formerly unprotected areas of Sombrio Beach and Mystic Beach. Geography Port Renfrew The park has an area of . The Juan de Fuca Marine Trail was originally part of a lifesaving trail that serviced this area, known at the time as the Graveyard of the Pacific. It has been upgraded and maintained over the years and is now a very popular hiking trail, very similar to the West Coast Trail in Pacific Rim National Park. The park is located west of Sooke and east of Port Renfrew, British Columbia. Conservation The primary role of Juan de Fuca Provincial Park is to protect a highly scenic and unique shoreline area between Sooke and Port Renfrew along the Strait of Juan de Fuca. The park encompasses a wide spectrum of natural values from forests to wildlife that must be protected and managed to reflect the purpose for which it was created. Juan de Fuca Provincial Park provides a protected habitat and natural corridor for many larger species of west coast mammals such as cougar, deer, black bear, wolf, otter, seal and sea lions. Red, purple and orange starfish and sea urchins, white gooseneck barnacles, blue mussels and green sea anemones and sea cucumbers only begin to hint at the colourful spectrum of intertidal life thriving here. Recreation The following recreational activities are available: vehicle accessible and wilderness camping, hiking, picnicking, interpretive walks, swimming, canoeing and kayaking, fishing, SCUBA diving, windsurfing, and surfing. The beach is best visited at low tide.

It is an island that is in size. Anyone is free to camp on Jedediah island; however, it is only accessible by boat. The nearest access is from Lasqueti Island. The Palmers The Palmers bought the Island in 1949 as a vacation getaway in the summer. Then in 1972 they moved to the island and became full-time residents. They lived there for twenty years. Mary Palmer didn't want the island to be developed after she was gone, so they fought long and hard to try to preserve it. In 1994 a small group of residents on Lasqueti Island became concerned that the Palmers might have to sell the property privately after the commitment from a land trust organization fell through. So they organized a campaign to save the island. In less than six months, more than four million dollars was raised. A major donation came from the family of Dan Culver, Canadian educator, white water rafting pioneer, sailor and mountain climber. Donations came from all over the province as the campaign gathered steam. Finally, the minister for the environment of the province of BC bought in too and the target amount was achieved and surpassed. But even at the eleventh hour, the deal was uncertain until Mary Palmer got the provincial park service to agree to Class A status for the island, meaning it could not be logged or mined. With that commitment in place she signed the island over to be our new Gulf Islands park. People all over donated and gave support. Then with a large donation from the Provincial Government, Jedediah Island was turned into a provincial park and can be enjoyed by visitors for years to come. The Foot In the summer of 2007, a family visiting Jedediah Island found the remains of a human foot on the beach they were at.

Nature walks and bird watching are also popular activities here. In winter, when the park is covered in snow, people also enjoy ice skating.

The park is located on and around »Ω√ÅU,WEL·πàEWÃ± (english name Mount Newton), a small mountain (elevation 305 m) in the traditional territory of Wsanec First Nations , itself situated 20 km north of Victoria, the provincial capital city. The mountain has always been known as »Ω√ÅU,WEL·πàEWÃ± to the First Nations people , the parks english name is after John Dean (1850-1943), who was a pioneer of the area and erected in the early 1900s a cabin close to what is now the centre of the park. Dean donated the original land which became the park in 1921, which was later expanded.BC Parks Information - John Dean Provincial Park Dean's cabin was razed in 1957, but the foundation and much of the building material remains, and the site is marked with a signpost. He is described as an eccentric who had been the mayor of Rossland and a life-long bachelor. He was interred at Ross Bay Cemetery. Featuring lush vegetation, the park is noted for its virgin old-growth douglas-fir and western red cedar, with large specimens up to 70 m in height (taller than the tallest tree in the UK and the tallest conifer in all of Europe) and for its rich Coastal Douglas- Fir ecosystem (CDF), little of which remains on southern Vancouver Island. About a quarter of the old-growth forest to the north-west lies on the Cole Bay reserve of the Pauquachin First Nation. Trails are well-marked and well- maintained. The terrain is hilly, but does not demand hiking gear in dry conditions, which prevail in the late spring and summer. The park's main entrance is closed to vehicle traffic from November to March. The off season is persistently wet and overcast, though the rain is often mild; if the temperature dips, heavy snowfall is not unusual in December and January. Location Mount Newton seen across Saanich Inlet The park itself, and the larger old-growth forest which contains the park, are bounded by Saanich Inlet to the west, the affluent community of Dean Park bounds portions of the forest on the east slope, the remainder is bounded on the south and south east by low-density residential and mixed-use agriculture, some pockets under the auspices of the Canadian Agricultural Land Reserve (ALR). The peninsula is only about 8 km wide where it straddles the park, and scenic views of Saanich Inlet to the west and of Cordova Channel, to the east are obtainable from marked vantage points. Mount Newton itself straddles North and Central Saanich, neighbouring municipalities of the Capital Regional District (CRD). The Greater Victoria region is known for its mild climate, tourism, government and technology sectors, ferry service to the Lower Mainland, and for the naval base CFB Esquimalt. The small but busy Victoria International Airport lies a short distance to the north east, which, in addition to commercial traffic, is home to the 443 Maritime Helicopter Squadron and is frequented by small planes, readily observed in the surrounding areas. Radar History traffic control radar located at the summit of Mount Newton in John Dean Provincial Park. At the summit of the mountain is a large doppler radar that can be seen from most elevated points in Victoria, British Columbia. It is referred to as the \\"big soccer ball\\" by citizens due to the appearance of its radome, but is in fact situated upon a massive foundation tower with top at 25 metres above the ground. The radar is owned and operated by Nav Canada and is used for air traffic control, and is commonly mistaken to be a weather radar. During the mid-1980s, Transport Canada purchased 39 new state of the art radar tower systems, which would provide complete aerial surveillance over Canada; it was a priority of national importance. Soon after, a Site Selection Committee was created to locate a site that met certain criteria for the Victoria International Airport. Many sites were considered but the Mount Newton site was the only one which met all the operational criteria; thus the Ministry of Transportation gave approval in 1982. The coverage area predicted was based on analysis of topographical maps. ‚ÄúAny potential impact by trees or foliage will be evaluated by flight checking after construction.‚Äù Raytheon Canada Ltd. received the contract to construct ready turnkey installations, using a standard tower configuration of a 25 meters height. After the tower was completed in November 1989, on February 23, 1990, Raytheon Canada Ltd. and Transport Canada conducted flight checks. The checks verified that the equipment was functioning to specifications, and the facility was handed over to Transport Canada. The facility is now located in a fenced off plot of land adjacent to the parking lot, accessible by a locked gate and gravel road. A second radar is located downwards from the first, it is a rotating parabolic radar owned and operated by the Canadian Coast Guard and is used for transmitting high frequency signals between Coast Guard ships and commercial/leisure vessels in emergencies. Botany John Dean Provincial Park contains virgin old-growth Douglas-fir (P. menziesii var. menziesii) and western red cedar (Thuja plicata), whereas almost all other spots contain 2nd growth or less. The tree species in the park include: western red cedar, coast douglas-fir, red alder, one shore pine, grand fir, arbutus, garry oak, some western hemlock (most abundant off the valley mist trail), bigleaf maple, the occasional pacific yew, some small black cottonwood, and shrub-like pacific serviceberry, cherries (genus Prunus), and a few willows (genus Salix). The park also contains rare native wildflowers, the pileated woodpecker (Dryocopus pileatus), and the increasingly endangered Garry oak (Quercus garryana var. garryana). The tallest tree, a Douglas-fir just off the Valley Mist trail is an impressive 70.9 m tall, and is the tallest tree in the municipality of North Saanich (the runner up is 69.9 m tall, very close by.) 73% of Vancouver Island's productive old-growth forests have been logged, 87% on southern Vancouver Island, and 99% of the coastal douglas-fir biogeoclimatic zone (see biogeoclimatic zones of British Columbia.) This species of douglas-fir, is currently the second tallest tree in Canada (93.27 metres, after a 96-metre Sitka spruce, the Carmanah Giant.) The Douglas-fir, at a record height of 126.5 m, used to be the second tallest tree in the world, taller than the redwoods, only exceeded by the mountain ash of Australia, at a record height of 150 m. The trees in the park, though, in no way set a record when compared to the giants of the wetter, better tree growing habitat of the west side of Vancouver Island, but are parts of the endangered dry old-growth douglas-fir habitat, of which only 1% remains since the onset of the industrial age. First Nations In First Nations culture, the top of the mountain was called »Ω√ÅU,WEL·πàEWÃ±, the high land that enabled them to survive the great flood-they anchored their canoe with a western red cedar rope to a tall arbutus tree at the summit. https://wsanecschoolboard.ca/about-the-school/the-legand-of- lauwelnew »Ω√ÅU,WELNEW is best pronounced as Tlay-will-nook. Topography An organisation of local citizens called the Friends of John Dean Park help upkeep the trails and signage throughout the park. There are approximately 6 km of hiking trails, with no significantly steep trails. The higher up the mountain, the trees change from a cedar-fir habitat to an oak-arbutus-fir forest. There are several lookout areas where hikers can get views of the Saanich Peninsula and the Saanich Inlet.

Latvia became a part of Nazi Germany's Reichskommissariat Ostland‚Äîthe Province General of Latvia (). Anyone not racially acceptable or who opposed the German occupation, as well as those who had cooperated with the Soviet Union, were killed or sent to concentration camps in accordance with the Nazi Generalplan Ost. Persecutions Immediately after the establishment of German authority at the beginning of July 1941, the elimination of the Jewish and Roma population began, with major mass killings taking place at Rumbula and elsewhere. The killings were committed by the Einsatzgruppe A, and the Wehrmacht. Latvian collaborators, including the 500‚Äì1,500 members of the ArƒÅjs Kommando (which alone killed around 26,000 Jews) and other Latvian members of the SD, were also involved.The Holocaust in Latvia , Andrievs Ezergailis The German Occupation and the First Wave of Murder The Simon Wiesenthal Center. 30,000 Jews were shot in the autumn of 1941 with most of the remaining Jewish people being rounded up and put into ghettos. In November and December 1941 the Riga Ghetto became crowded and to make room for the imminent arrival of German Jews, who were being shipped out of the country, all the remaining 30,000 Jews in Riga were taken from the ghetto to the nearby Rumbula Forest and shot. German, Austrian and the present-day Czech Republic Jews, now located in the Riga ghetto were put to work and placed on very reduced rations. The Kaiserwald concentration camp was built in 1943 at Me≈æaparks on the edge of Riga which took most of the inmates from the ghetto. In the camp the inmates were put to work by large German companies. Before the Soviet forces returned, all Jews under 18 or over 30 were shot, with the remainder moved to Stutthof concentration camp. During the years of Nazi occupation, special campaigns killed 90,000 people in Latvia, approximately 70,000 of whom were Jews and 2,000 Gypsies. Those who were not Jews or Gypsies were mostly civilians whose political opinions and activity were unacceptable to the German occupiers. Jewish and Gypsy civilians were eliminated as a result of the Nazi \\"theory of races\\" as set out in the Nazi Generalplan Ost plan. Resistance Resistance in Latvia was very confusing, it included people resisting the Soviet occupation who were happy to work with the German forces, Soviet supporters resisting the German occupation, and nationalists resisting everyone who was occupying or trying to occupy Latvia. Then there were people who changed their support when the Soviets started arresting and deporting people, many more when the Nazi soldiers started killing Latvians, and others when the Soviet troops returned. And lastly there were people who felt persecuted, mainly the Jews, who resisted anyone trying to kill them, including Latvians as well as Germans. Many resistance people ended up joining either the German and some, the Soviet armies, as a means of fighting. Very few were able to live as independent bands in the forests. When the Germans first arrived in Latvia they found anti-Soviet guerrilla bands operating in many areas, of varying quality, some swollen by deserters from Soviet units. The largest and most effective was led by KƒÅrlis AperƒÅts who moved on to become a Standartenf√ºhrer, (full colonel) in the Waffen SS. Some Latvians resisted the German occupation undertaking solo acts of bravery, like ≈Ωanis Lipke who risked his life to save more than 50 Jews. The Latvian resistance movement was divided between the pro-independence units under the Latvian Central Council and the pro-Soviet forces under the Central Staff of the Partisan Movement in Moscow. Their Latvian commander was Arturs Sproƒ£is. The Latvian Central Council published the outlawed publication Brƒ´vƒÅ Latvija (Free Latvia). The periodical promoted the idea of renewing democracy in Latvia after the war. Public displays of resistance such as the 15 May 1942 in Riga resulted in the young nationalists being arrested, others were prevented when their plans were discovered. Partisan activity increased after Operation Winterzauber (\\"Winter Magic\\") undertaken by the Germans who destroyed 99 villages in eastern Latvia, 6,000 of the villagers deported for forced labour, and 3,600 shot in early 1943. However, much partisan activity was centred on forcing civilians to provide food and shelter for the partisans rather than fighting Germans. Soviet- supporting partisans, many of whom were actually Soviet soldiers operating behind the lines, sent messages to Moscow making wild claims of success, for instance claims that 364 trains were destroyed, which bear no resemblance to German reports. These \\"reports\\" were used as propaganda by the Soviets. Resistance continued at an increased level after the return of the Red Army in July 1944, with perhaps 40,000 Latvians involved and around 10,000 active at any point in time. Latvians in the Soviet army The Soviet Union conscripted into its army sections of independent Latvia's military units, as well as those Latvians who had ended up in Russia as a result of previous wars or had originally lived there. Many Latvian soldiers deserted when Germany attacked Latvia. A few, especially Jews, continued to serve happily with the Soviet forces. 130th Latvian Rifle Corps of the Order of Suvorov. This Red Army national formation was formed, for the third time, on June 5, 1944, shortly before the Red Army attacked Latvia. Their strength was about 15,000 men, which consisted three divisions ‚Äì 43rd Guards, 308th Latvian Rifle Division and a Soviet division. The Corps units fought against the Latvian Legion's 19th Division units.–í–µ–ª–∏–∫–∞—è –û—Ç–µ—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–∞—è –≤–æ–π–Ω–∞ (22.6.1941‚Äì9.5.1945). The unit contained few Latvian soldiers, but was important for propaganda purposes. Latvians in the German army Nazi Germany, on arrival in Latvia looked to recruit Latvian units to act in accordance with the Nazi Generalplan Ost which required the population of Latvia to be cut by 50%, they quickly located Viktors ArƒÅjs who was leading a unit that became known as the Arajs Kommando. It became infamous for its actions against the Jewish population, such as the burning of the Riga synagogues with people still inside and being active in the Rumbula massacre the 500 men executing an estimated 26,000 Jews, Gypsies and others deemed undesirable. Latvian Auxiliary Police battalions were raised from volunteers, the first sent to the front was involved in heavy fighting in June 1942 and acquitted itself well. Latvia however wanted to raise a Latvian Legion, under the command of Latvian officers, offering to raise an army of 100,000. In January 1943, becoming short of troops, Hitler agreed. This took away the need to conscript Latvian men, which would have been an illegal act. So was born the 15th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Latvian). Two police battalions fighting near Leningrad with Dutch and Flemish soldiers were pulled back in May 1943 and with reinforcements from Latvia and a change of uniform, transformed into the 2nd Latvian SS Volunteer Brigade and made part of 2nd SS Infantry Brigade. The senior Latvian commander Lt Col VoldemƒÅrs Veiss being awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross in January 1944. The brigade was expanded into the 19th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (2nd Latvian) in January 1944. Defeat and retreat of Nazi forces On 12 January 1944, the latest Red Army assault managed to lift the 900-day Siege of Leningrad, during which over 1,000,000 people had died and on 20 January German troops started to retreat. The re-conquering of the Baltic area was undertaken as a direct follow through of the assault that started in Leningrad, entering Estonia in early February, along with much of Ukraine and Belarus. Nazi Germany began to suffer regular defeats on the eastern front and was pushed back to the west. The 2nd Latvian SS Brigade which was now upgraded to the 19th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (2nd Latvian), was amongst those fighting before the spring thaw slowed the attacks. On 22 June, the third anniversary of the German invasion was chosen as the start date for Operation Bagration. The massive Soviet attack was catastrophic for the German armies who fell back before the onslaught. It was mid-July 1944 before the Soviet Army once again crossed Latvia's pre-war eastern border, the Soviet armies continued westward leaving sufficient troops to block in the remaining German forces until they attacked on 11 September as a diversion for an attack in Estonia. On 9 October Riga was in artillery range of the Red Army. German troops, including the 19th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (2nd Latvian) under the code name Donner (Thunder), withdrew from Riga, destroying bridges as they went. Battles were quite bloody but by 13 October 1944 the Soviets had re-captured Riga. By mid October, the German Army, which partly included the \\"Latvian Legion\\", was besieged in Kurzeme, in the \\"Courland Pocket\\". Some 200,000 German troops held out in Courland. They were trapped between the Baltic Sea and the Soviet lines while the Soviet Army concentrated on attacks in East Prussia, Silesia, Pomerania, and ultimately Berlin. Colonel-General Heinz Guderian, the Chief of the German General Staff, insisted that the troops in Courland be evacuated by sea and used for the defense of the Reich. However, Hitler refused and ordered the German forces in Courland to hold out. He believed them necessary to protect German submarine bases along the Baltic coast. On January 15, 1945, Army Group Courland () was formed under Colonel- General Dr. Lothar Rendulic. Until the end of the war, Army Group Courland (including divisions such as the Latvian Freiwiliger SS Legion) successfully defended the area in which they were besieged. It held out until May 8, 1945, when Colonel-General Carl Hilpert, the army group's last commander, surrendered to Marshal Leonid Govorov. At this time, the group consisted of some 31 divisions of varying strength. Approximately 200,000 troops of Army Group Courland surrendered, including 14,000 Latvian soldiers. They were deported to Soviet prison camps in the east after surrender on 9 May. Many Latvians fled through this battlefield in fishing boats and ships to Sweden and Germany, from where they emigrated to various parts of the world, mostly Australia and North America. Approximately 150,000 Latvians ended up in exile in the West. Aftermath of the Second World War During World War II more than 200,000 Latvian soldiers ended up in the rank and file of both occupation forces; approximately half of them (100,000) were killed on the battlefield. It is estimated that, as a result of the war, the population of Latvia decreased by between 300,000 and 500,000 (a 25% decrease compared to 1939). The war also heavily damaged the economy: many historic cities were destroyed, as well as industry and infrastructure. As of 1940, most western governments did not recognise the incorporation of Latvia and the other Baltic States into the Soviet Union. The only exception was Sweden, which returned the members of the \\"Latvian Legion\\", who had ended up in Sweden at the end of the war, to the USSR, and handed the diplomatic representative offices of the Baltic countries in Stockholm to the USSR. After the war, the United States applied the most persistent pressure on the Soviet Union regarding the Baltic States' wish for independence. Throughout the entire period of occupation, the embassy of independent Latvia continued to function in Washington, D.C. and London.

Characters The books follow young football star Simon \\"Specky\\" Magee through his teenage years. He is obsessed with AFL, as are most of his mates. Simon \\"Specky\\" Magee is the titular character of the novels. He attends local high school Booyong High throughout books 1-3 and 5-7, pausing for a short stint at Gosmore Grammar in book 4. He is portrayed as a twelve- year-old in book 1, a thirteen-year-old in book 2 and in book 3, and a fourteen-year-old Year 9 student in the remaining books. He is incredibly skilled at Aussie Rules footy, mainly as a full-forward, but also occasionally as a wingman, centre-half forward or even centre-half back. He supports five AFL teams, something he cops a lot of flack for: Essendon, Brisbane, Collingwood, Sydney and West Coast. He is the main character, he is adopted his biological mother died in a car accident and his biological father couldn't care for him as it was too difficult. His father barracks for Geelong and his adopted parents (and sister) hate Football. Josh Roberts is one of Specky's best mates.

She moved to Sydney in book 6, but returned at the start of book 7. Samantha \\"Tiger Girl\\" Shepherd is another of Specky's close friends. She meets Specky in book 3, while she is in Year 9 and he is in Year 8. Specky supports her through her battle with cancer, and become close friends by the end of the book. She also reveals that she is staying down a year to make up for her long absences from school due to her treatment, so is now in Year 9, like Specky and his mates. They have always felt romantically close to each other, but this intensified in book 7, when Robbo and Tiger Girl's relationship ended. They are now a couple, something Christina is not aware of. Supports the Tigers, hence her nickname. Derek \\"Screamer\\" Johnson is Specky's long-time enemy, and now one-time friend. He enters the series in book 2, sparking jealousy from Specky, due to his immediate connection with Christina, and his skill at full-forward. In book 5, Specky learns of Screamer's extraordinary piano talent, and encourages him to follow his dreams, which turns them into friends at the end of the book. In book 7, it is revealed that he is leaving Booyong High to attend Eckert School of Music on a piano scholarship, in Sydney. Ben \\"Gobba\\" Higgins is another of Specky's school mates. He is first mentioned in book 3, when he returns from Canada, apparently having been there a year, but had not been mentioned before that. His nickname comes from his dream and talent of being a pro sports commentator, and he is so good that he is enrolled in the Dennis Cometti School of Young Sports Callers. He gets frequent assignments from this school, but still attends Booyong full-time. He supports the Bulldogs. Johnny Cockatoo is one of Specky's close friends. The two meet on Specky's trip to the Northern Territory in book 2, and immediately bond. When Johnny moves down to Melbourne, the two's friendship becomes stronger. He plays rover, like Danny, and the two are shown to work very well together. He is very proud of his Aboriginal heritage, and knows everything about indigenous AFL players. He barracks for the Kangaroos. Brian Edwards is another of Specky's friends. He first appears in book 5, when the two meet through State footy training. To meet his commitments to the State team in Melbourne, Brian temporarily moves from Rivergum (near Mildura) to Specky's place, but obviously leaves. He is mentioned briefly in book 7, but makes no other appearance in book 7, hinting that he has left Booyong and Specky's house, but is still in Melbourne to play for the Vics. He is the third character in the books to support Carlton (the others being Christina and Screamer). Maria \\"Gladiator\\" Testi is Danny's love interest. A national sprint champion, she expresses interest in Danny during book six, especially at Alice's sweet sixteen party. In book 7, her role deepens, appearing in Specky, Danny, Robbo, Sols, the Bullet, Gobba and Tiger Girl's maths class, but Danny breaks it off with her during this novel because she became too clingy, only to reunite again. Sanjay \\"Bombay Bullet\\" Sharma is one of Specky's friends, though is shown to be not one of his best mates. He is of Indian descent, and is proud of his heritage. An outstanding sprinter, hence his nickname, the Bullet is capable of superb dashes and awe-inspiring snaps. Paul \\"Smashing Sols\\" Solomon is another of Specky's friends, and like the Bullet, not an extremely close one. Their relationship grows slightly in book 7, united in their hatred of their new Maths teacher. His nickname comes from his brilliant tackling ability. Coach Sandy Pate is Specky's AFL coach from book 2 to the start of book 7. She is a fair coach, coming to Booyong at the beginning of book 2, to replace Coach Pappas. She likes Specky, and often gives him advice. She leaves in book 7 to go to Italy with her fiancee, leaving the AFL coaching duties to Mr Rutherford, who is also Specky's maths teacher. Mr Rutherford appears solely in book 7, though it is assumed that his part in the books will expand as the series goes on. He appears as Specky's new maths teacher, and is known as a strict, tough, unfair teacher by Specky and his mates. Things get worse when he becomes coach, but Specky gets to like him when Mr Rutherford apologises for dismissing Specky from the footy team when he fails a math test that turns out not to be his. Alice Magee is Specky's sixteen-year-old sister. She is shown on various occasions to dislike Specky, but it is known that she cares for him. She is dating The Great McCarthy, a Year 12 friend of Specky's, though their relationship has become strained through Great McCarthy's VCE studies. Has a hatred of AFL, though when Shane Crawford kissed her, she converted into a Hawks supporter, but her support for Shane and the club deteriorated quickly. David & Jane Magee are Specky's adoptive parents. They are often tough, but fair on Specky, especially when it comes to his footy commitments. It has been said that David is lousy at all sports, and so doesn't support Specky, but this changes from book 2 onwards. Jane is also a good cook, as mentioned in book 7. They took in David's brother Bob's young child (Specky) at eighteen months. Gus \\"Einstein\\" Turner is probably the most distant of Specky's school acquaintances. He is known in the first two books as a half-forward, but in book 7 he becomes known as a full-back. A maths whiz, Einstein is known to surmise distances, of AFL kicks especially. He floats out of the series after the first two books, and does not make an appearance after that, apart from a brief mention in book 7. According to the Specky Magee website, he barracks for Geelong. Jack Magee is Specky's baby brother. He first appears in book 6, as he is born, but is currently unable to speak or walk. He mainly gurgles throughout book 7, especially when he is having a good time. Ken Magee is Specky's grandfather, and the reason Specky supports the West Coast Eagles. He enters the Magee house in book 7, causing a lot of tension. He has a tumour, and is expected to live only another eight months longer. Dieter \\"The Great McCarthy\\" McCarthy is a Year 12 student, studying economics. He is Alice's boyfriend, and Specky's acquaintance. He is shown to smoke, though is trying to give it up, and was once the Richmond mascot, who he supports. Kyle Rutherford appears, like his father, solely in book 7, but will presumably return for the rest of the series. He and his dad move to Booyong in this novel, something that he resents, having been a big fish in a small pond there, and is jealous of Specky, possibly because of his status, or his skills, and deliberately sets Specky up to fail his maths test to kick him off the team.

It opened on 27 April 1992 and is in Zone 1 of Greater Manchester's Metrolink light rail system. The stop's platforms were extended in 2009. Later redevelopment in 2015‚Äì16 demolished the original two side platforms and replaced them with a twin-island platform layout which allows for limited cross-platform interchange. The stop is the most used on the Metrolink network and lies between Deansgate-Castlefield to the South-West and either Exchange Square, Market Street or Piccadilly Gardens tram stops. History Plans for a rapid transit station in St Peter's Square were made in the 1970s; proposals for the abandoned Picc-Vic tunnel envisaged the construction of an underground station to serve both St Peter's and the neighbouring Albert Square. publicity brochure The early proposals for an on- street light rail system in Manchester revived the idea of a station in the square. St. Peter's Square was one of the original city-centre stops to open when Metrolink started operations in 1992, when it consisted of two side platforms and basic shelters. In common with most newly built Metrolink stops at the time, St. Peter's Square had two-level platforms, meaning only a short section of the platforms offered level boarding. The stop was demolished and rebuilt with a full length platform and improved passenger facilities in November 2009. When a building called Elisabeth House, which had stood between Dickinson Street and Oxford Street since the 1970s, was demolished for redevelopment in 2011 as One St Peter's Square, architects' plans were entered in a competition, which was modified in 2011 to incorporate proposals to improve the Metrolink station. In March 2012 a shortlist of two submissions was made.One St Peter's Square; E-architect The stop closed in 2015 for 14 months to allow a total redevelopment, and re-opened on 28 August 2016 as a four-platform interchange, comprising 2 island platforms, one for inbound services and the other for outbound. This offers same-direction cross-platform interchange. The stop was moved slightly north towards Princess Street, from that of its old location, which was in front of Manchester Central Library. A number of trees were planted within the structure of the platforms to improve the look and feel of the space. The Manchester Cenotaph was also relocated and the entire square has been redeveloped into a new public space. During most of the work, a reduced service ran through the square on a single track \\\\- but there were 2 full 2-month closures at the beginning and end of the project. This meant between late June and the end of August 2015 and from 26 June 2016 until 28 August 2016, no Metrolink services ran through the square. The rebuilding work uncovered the remnants of an 18th century church crypt.

At the 2011 census, Nannup had a population of 587.http://www.censusdata.abs.gov.au/census_services/getproduct/census/2016/quickstat/UCL521042?opendocument History Nannup's name is of Noongar origin, meaning either \\"stopping place\\" or \\"place of parrots\\", and was first recorded by surveyors in the 1860s. The area was at one point known as \\"Lower Blackwood\\", and the first European settler to explore it was Thomas Turner in 1834. In 1866, a bridge was built over the river and a police station was established. A townsite was set aside in 1885, surveyed in 1889 and gazetted on 9 January 1890. In 1906, a primary school and shire office were built. In 1909, the Nannup Branch Railway (no longer in operation) was extended from Jarrahwood, linking to the Bunbury- Busselton railway. Menaced by bushfires in 1928, settlers had to battle hard against the flames to save their properties. More bushfires, fanned by strong winds, swept across the region in 1935 burning out over and destroying one house and a barn. More bushfires were burning in the district over the course of several days in 1937, resulting in the stables and the sheds at the local race course being burned down, the destruction of large amounts of feed for stock, and the loss of telephone lines. The town was flooded in 1945 when the Blackwood River rose to its highest flood level recorded to that date. Three families were left homeless and others had to be evacuated from the floodwaters. At its highest level the river was running over the Russell Street bridge and the town's electricity supply failed from lines being damaged, leaving the town in darkness. The river flooded again in 1946 and 1947, closing roads but not causing any significant damage to the town. In 1949 the town received of rain in a period of seven hours, causing flooding and one bridge connecting the town to Busselton to be swept away. Bushfires once again struck in 1950 with several large fires burning only a few miles from town. The outbreak destroyed nearly of jarrah and karri forest. The fires were brought under control reasonably quickly; they were believed to have been deliberately lit. The Dry Brook bridge just outside town on the Nannup- Balingup collapsed as a result of flood damage from the previous years. Although the bridge had been repaired after being damaged in smaller floods of 1950, it was undercut again and caved in without causing any injuries. In 1982 after the remnants of a tropical cyclone passed through the south west, the town and surrounding areas were inundated by heavy rains. The Blackwood rose , submerging over 50 houses. Many historical photographs are held by the Nannup Historical Society.http://www.nannuphistory.org The movie Drift was filmed largely in Nannup in 2011. One of the oldest buildings, a stone cottage built in 1862-63, is still standing on a farm on Gold Gully Rd. The building was in disrepair for a number of years but is being restored by the current owner. Marinko Tomas memorial Marinko Tomas (1945‚Äì1966), a farmer, originally from Nannup, was Western Australia's first national serviceman killed in the Vietnam War. A memorial with a statue and plaque was erected in March 1988 in Nannup's Bicentennial Park. Lance Corporal Tomas died on 8 July 1966, at the age of 21 years, after being hit by shrapnel from \\"friendly artillery forces\\".. Present day Nannup is the only town within the Shire of Nannup, and has a district high school (1961), telecentre, shire offices, roadhouse, a sporting complex, shopping facilities, accommodation for travellers (hotel/motel, bed and breakfast, caravan park), police station, three cafes, a hardware store, community centre, golf club and golf course, nursery and a gemstone museum. The main street has changed little over the years so has considerable heritage value. The town population is about 600, with 1200 in the Shire of Nannup. Economy Timber milling and agriculture (principally beef cattle) dominate the local economy although wine, floriculture and tourism are industries of growing importance. Furniture production and other local timber value-adding activities are also a minor employer. World's largest wooden pendulum clock In January 2019, the world's largest wooden pendulum clock was installed in a purpose built clocktower in the main street. Built by local, Kevin Bird, and featuring timbers from the region, the tall clock had taken 15 years to build.World's largest wooden clock gives WA town hope of tourism revival, Kate Stephens and Anthony Pancia, ABC News Online, 2019-01-11 However, in April 2019, after three months, disagreements between landlords and Kevin Bird led to the landlord requiring the removal of the clock. Events and festivals Since the beginnings of the tourist industry in Nannup there have been several events and festivals held to promote the town. These include the Flower and Garden Festival held in August each year, the Quit Forest Rally. Also the Tour of Margaret River and seven cycle races. The largest of Nannup's annual festivals is the Nannup Music Festival (formerly the Southwest Folk Festival) held over the Labour Day long weekend in March each year and includes street performance and market stalls as well as a variety of musical performances.

Originally established as VF-1 on February 1, 1943, redesignated as VF-5 on July 15, 1943, redesignated as VF-5A on November 15, 1946, redesignated VF-51 on August 16, 1948 and disestablished in March 1995.  History  Until its disestablishment, VF-51 was the oldest fighter squadron in continuous service with the Pacific Fleet. VF-51's roots are traced back to 1927 when the Screaming Eagles insignia could be seen with the VF-3S Striking Eagles which flew the Curtis F6C-4. In October 1947, the Screaming Eagles became the first Navy squadron to enter the jet age with delivery of the North American FJ-1 Fury; the squadron used this fighter to conduct the USN's first operational all-jet aircraft carrier landing at sea on 10 March 1948 aboard . After transitioning to the Grumman F9F-2 Panther, VF-51 became the first squadron to take jets into combat and score the first air-to- air kills in the Korean War. Future astronaut and first man to walk on the Moon, Neil Armstrong, was also a Naval Aviator in VF-51 during this period. F9F-2s launching from USS Essex in 1951 During the Vietnam War, VF-51 was the first squadron to evaluate the air-to-ground capability of the F-8 Crusader, and because of this, VF-51 was picked to fly secret interdiction missions into Laos in June 1964. The squadron became MiG killers when they shot down two North Vietnamese MiG-21s in 1968. In 1971 VF-51 transitioned to the F-4 Phantom and shot down four MiG-17s. During the final stages of the war VF-51 flew from . VF-51 F-8E launching from in 1970 In 1976, VF-51 and the rest of Carrier Air Wing 15 was deployed on a peacetime Mediterranean cruise on , returning in April 1977. The purpose of this cruise on a soon-to-be scrapped carrier was to take the first squadron of United States Marine Corps AV-8A Harriers to sea. Following this Mediterranean cruise and return to NAS Miramar, VF-51 phased out its F-4 Phantom IIs. On 16 June 1978, VF-51 transitioned to the Block 100 version of the F-14A Tomcat and their first cruise with the F-14 was in May 1979 with Carrier Air Wing 15 aboard . As part of CVW-15, VF-51 remained partnered with its sister squadron, VF-111, also flying the F-14. This cruise, originally slated to end in early December 1979, was extended by Presidential direction during the Kitty Hawk Battle Group's final port call in the Philippines in late November 1979 as a result of the seizure of the American Embassy in Iran the same month and the subsequent Iranian Hostage Crisis. Both squadrons participated in the preparatory efforts to rescue American hostages in Iran, frequently intercepting both Iranian and Soviet aircraft in the region, but departing the Indian Ocean in February 1980 and turning responsibilities over to the Battle Group and its embarked Carrier Air Wing 8 with VF-41 and VF-84 prior to execution of Operation Eagle Claw. For this 1979‚Äì1980 deployment, VF-51 was awarded the Battle E as the top fighter squadron in the Pacific Fleet. After one more cruise with Kitty Hawk, the air wing moved to the East coast for a short period of time, flying from the newly introduced from March to October 1983 as the ship transited to its new homeport of NAS Alameda, California and assignment to the Pacific Fleet. VF-51 is credited to be the first F-14 squadron to intercept Soviet Tu-26 Backfire bombers, armed MiG-23 Floggers and Su-15 Flagons using the Tomcat's TCS (Television Camera Sight). The TCS allowed the crew to passively identify a target to determine if it was hostile or not. F-4Bs in the 1972 Screaming Eagle (also known as the Supersonic Can Opener) paint scheme During the 1986‚Äì1987 cruise with USS Carl Vinson, VF-51 conducted operations in the Bering Sea during the winter. In February 1990, USS Carl Vinson conducted operations in the Western Pacific and Indian Ocean. VF-51 and VF-111 took part in several exercises with regional air forces, including Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand. The air wing returned home on 29 July. Original Navy plans saw VF-51 and VF-111 becoming the first deployable squadrons to transition to the F-14D Super Tomcat, however these plans were cancelled in December 1991 and VF-51 spent its time to its disestablishment in March 1995 flying the same F-14As it had transitioned to in 1978. Popular media Tu-95 Bear. In 1985, VF-51 was one of several NAS Miramar based squadrons to participate in the filming of Top Gun. Some VF-51 and VF-111 aircraft were repainted in fictitious squadron markings for the film. To be able to film the sequences, the F-14s were fitted with cameras mounted in pods attached to the underbelly Phoenix pallets and the under wing pylons, as well as using ground mounted cameras. Late in the film, Tom Skerritt's character mentions that he flew with VF-51 off with the main character's father, and several VF-51 pilots appear in the film credits. VF-51 never flew F-4s off Oriskany, as the Phantom was too large for that carrier. Publicity photos for Top Gun: Maverick show a character with a \\"VFA-51\\" helmet bag. This is fictitious due to VF-51 being disestablished rather than transitioned to the F-18.

A boost controller can be a simple manual control which can be easily fabricated, or it may be included as part of the engine management computer in a factory turbocharged car, or an aftermarket electronic boost controller.  Principles of operation  Without a boost controller, air pressure is fed from the charge air (compressed side) of the turbocharger directly to the wastegate actuator via a vacuum hose. This air pressure can come from anywhere on the intake after the turbo, including after the throttle body, though that is less common. This air pressure pushes against the force of a spring located in the wastegate actuator to allow the wastegate to open and re-direct exhaust gas so that it does not reach the turbine wheel. In this simple configuration, the spring's springrate and preload determine how much boost pressure the system will achieve. Springs are classified by the boost pressure they typically achieve, such as a \\"7 psi spring\\" that will allow the turbocharger to reach equilibrium at approximately . One primary problem of this system is the wastegate will start to open well before the actual desired boost pressure is achieved. This negatively affects the threshold of boost onset and also increases turbocharger lag. For instance, a spring rated at 7 psi may allow the wastegate to begin to (but not fully) open at as little as . Achieving moderate boost levels consistently is also troublesome with this configuration. At partial throttle, full boost may still be reached, making the vehicle difficult to control with precision. Electronic systems can allow the throttle to control the level of boost, so that only at full throttle will maximum boost levels be achieved and intermediate levels of boost can be held consistently at partial throttle levels. Also to be noted is the way in which boost control is achieved, depending on the type of wastegate used. Typically manual \\"bleed type\\" boost controllers are only used on swing type (single port) wastegate actuators. To increase boost, pressure is taken away from the actuator control line, therefore increasing the turbo output pressure required to counteract the controllers leak-lowered pressure acting on the wastegate. Dual port swing type wastegate actuators and external wastegates generally require electronic boost control although adjustable boost control can also be achieved on both of these with an air pressure regulator, this is not the same as a bleed type boost controller. To increase boost with an external or dual port wastegate, pressure is added to the top control port to increase boost. When boost control is not fitted, this control port is open to the atmosphere.  Manual boost control  A simple manual boost controller. A small screw is located in the top of the aluminum body to adjust bleed rate. This model is placed in the engine bay; however, the vacuum line could be extended to allow it to reach into the passenger compartment. A bleed-type manual boost controller simple mechanical and pneumatic control to allow some pressure from the wastegate actuator to escape or bleed out to the atmosphere or back into the intake system. This can be as simple as a T-fitting on the boost control line near the actuator with a small bleeder screw. The screw can be turned out to varying degrees to allow air to bleed out of the system, relieving pressure on the wastegate actuator, thus increasing boost levels. These devices are popular due to their negligible cost compared to other devices that may offer the same power increase. A ball & spring type boost controller uses the force of a spring acting against the boost pressure to control boost. This is installed with one boost signal line coming from the intake somewhere after the turbocharger, and one boost signal line going to the wastegate. A knob changes the force on the spring which in turn dictates how much pressure is on the ball. The tighter the spring, the more boost that is needed to unseat the ball, and allow the boost pressure to reach the wastegate actuator. There is a bleed hole on the boost controller after the ball, to allow the pressurized air to escape that would otherwise be trapped between the wastegate actuator and the ball after it is seated again. These type of Manual boost controllers are very popular since they do not provide a boost leak, allowing faster spool times and better control than a \\"bleed type\\" boost controller.http://www.fiercecontrollers.com/uncategorized/bleed-or-ball-and- spring-manual-boost-controller/ There are several different designs of ball- and-spring controllers on the market that range greatly in terms of cost and quality. Common body materials are brass and aluminum vary from inline to 90 degree designs. Another design aspect is the ball valve seat which is critical for performance stability.https://www.precisionballs.com/ball_valve.php Generally a manual boost controller will not be located within the cabin of the vehicle as the lengthy vacuum piping run between the turbo/wastegate & controller can introduce response issues into the system. It is possible to use two manual boost controllers at different settings with a solenoid to switch between them for two different boost pressure settings. Some factory turbocharged cars have a switch to regulate boost pressure, such as a setting designed for fuel economy and a setting for performance. Manual boost controllers cannot be used to set a specific boost level at a given throttle position (& therefore be used to optimise driveability & control issues), although a ball-spring type boost controller does allow the boost threshold to be as low as is possible on a given engine configuration, and also keeps turbo spool as fast as is possible as the wastegate remains completely shut until the desired boost pressure is reached, ensuring 100% of the exhaust gases are diverted through the turbocharger exhaust turbine. They can be used in conjunction with some electronic systems.  Electronic boost control  A 3-port pneumatic solenoid. This solenoid allows interrupt or blocking of the boost pressure rather than just bleed type control. Electronic boost control adds an air control solenoid and/or a stepper motor controlled by an electronic control unit. The same general principle of a manual controller is present, which is to control the air pressure presented to the wastegate actuator. Further control and intelligent algorithms can be introduced, refining and increasing control over actual boost pressure delivered to the engine. At the component level, boost pressure can either be bled out of the control lines or blocked outright. Either can achieve the goal of reducing pressure pushing against the wastegate. In a bleed-type system air is allowed to pass out of the control lines, reducing the load on the wastegate actuator. On a blocking configuration, air traveling from the charge air supply to the wastegate actuator is blocked while simultaneously bleeding any pressure that has previously built up at the wastegate actuator.  Control details  PWM PID controller Control for the solenoids and stepper motors can be either closed loop or open loop. Closed loop systems rely on feedback from a manifold pressure sensor to meet a predetermined boost pressure. Open loop systems have a predetermined control output where control output is merely based on other inputs such as throttle angle and/or engine RPM. Open loop specifically leaves out a desired boost level, while closed loop attempts to target a specific level of boost pressure. Since open loop systems do not modify control levels based on MAP sensor, differing boost pressure levels may be reached based on outside variables such as weather conditions or engine coolant temperature. For this reason, systems that do not feature closed loop operation are not as widespread. Boost controllers often use pulse width modulation (PWM) techniques to bleed off boost pressure on its way to the reference port on the wastegate actuator diaphragm in order to (on occasion ) under report boost pressure in such a way that the wastegate permits a turbocharger to build more boost pressure in the intake than it normally could. In effect, a boost- control solenoid valve lies to the wastegate under the engine control unit¬¥s (ECU) control. The boost control solenoid contains a needle valve that can open and close very quickly. By varying the pulse width to the solenoid, the solenoid valve can be commanded to be open a certain percentage of the time. This effectively alters the flow rate of air pressure through the valve, changing the rate at which air bleeds out of the T in the manifold pressure reference line to the wastegate. This effectively changes the air pressure as seen by the wastegate actuator diaphragm. Solenoids may require small diameter restrictors be installed in the air control lines to limit airflow and even out the on/off nature of their operation. The wastegate control solenoid can be commanded to run in a variety of frequencies in various gears, engine speeds, or according to various other factors in a deterministic open-loop mode. Or, by monitoring manifold pressure in a feedback loop, the engine management system can monitor the efficacy of PWM changes in the boost control solenoid bleed rate at altering boost pressure in the intake manifold, increasing or decreasing the bleed rate to target a particular maximum boost. The basic algorithm sometimes involves the EMS (engine management system) \\"learning\\" how quickly the turbocharger can spool and how quickly the boost pressure increases. Armed with this knowledge, as long as boost pressure is below a predetermined allowable ceiling, the EMS will open the boost control solenoid to allow the turbocharger to create overboost beyond what the wastegate would normally allow. As overboost reaches the programmable maximum, the EMS begins to decrease the bleed rate through the control solenoid to raise boost pressure as seen at the wastegate actuator diaphragm so the wastegate opens enough to limit boost to the maximum configured level of over- boost. Stepper motors allow fine control of airflow based on position and speed of the motor, but may have low total airflow capability. Some systems use a solenoid in conjunction with a stepper motor, with the stepper motor allowing fine control and the solenoid coarse control. Many configurations are possible with 2-, 3-, and 4-port solenoids and stepper motors in series or parallel. Two-port solenoid bleed systems with a PID controller tend to be common on factory turbocharged cars.  Advantages  Since less positive pressure can be present at the wastegate actuator as desired boost is approached the wastegate remains closer to a completely closed state. This keeps exhaust gas routed through the turbine and increases energy transferred to the wheels of the turbocharger. Once desired boost is reached, closed loop based systems react by allowing more air pressure to reach the wastegate actuator to stop the further increase in air pressure so desired boost levels are maintained. This reduces turbocharger lag and lowers boost threshold. Boost pressure builds faster when the throttle is depressed quickly and allows boost pressure to build at lower engine RPM than without such a system. This also allows the use of a much softer spring in the actuator. For instance, a spring together with a boost controller may still be able to achieve a maximum boost level of well over . The electronic control unit can be programmed to control psi at half throttle, at 3/4 throttle, and at full throttle, or whatever levels the programmer or designer of the control unit intends. This partial throttle control greatly increases driver control over the engine and vehicle.  Limitations and disadvantages  Even with an electronic controller, actuator springs that are too soft can cause the wastegate to open before desired. Exhaust gas backpressure is still pushing against the wastegate valve itself. This backpressure can overcome the spring pressure without the aid of the actuator at all. Electronic control may still enable control of boost to over double gauge pressure of the spring's rated pressure. The solenoid and stepper motors also need to be installed in such a way to maximize the advantages of failure modes. For instance, if a solenoid is installed to control boost electronically, it should be installed such that if the solenoid fails in the most common failure mode (probably non-energized position) the boost control falls back to simple wastegate actuator boost levels. It is possible a solenoid or stepper motor could get stuck in a position that lets no boost pressure reach the wastegate, causing boost to quickly rise out of control. The electronic systems, extra hoses, solenoids and soforth add complexity to the turbocharger system. This runs counter to the \\"keep it simple\\" principle as there are more things that can go wrong. It is worth noting that virtually all modern factory turbocharged cars, the same cars with long warranty periods, implement electronic boost control. Manufacturers such as Subaru, Mitsubishi and Saab integrate electronic boost control in all turbo model cars.  Availability and applications  Electronic boost control systems are available as aftermarket stand-alone systems such as the HKS EVC and VBC, Apex-i AVC-R, GFB G-force, or Gizzmo IBC / MS-IBC as a built-in feature of modern factory turbocharged vehicles such as the Subaru Impreza WRX STi and often as built-in features in full aftermarket stand-alone engine management systems such as the Holley EFI, Hydra Nemesis, AEM EMS and MegaSquirt.  Dangers in use  Installing a boost controller in a vehicle that is already well tuned, such as a factory turbocharged car, may allow higher boost pressure than tolerable by the engine or turbocharger, reducing life and reliability. Care should be taken to avoid exceeding the limits of any engine system components such as the engine block, fuel injectors, or engine management system. This is as true with boost control as it is with fuel and timing controls, or any number of other engine system modifications. In particular, users may find the extremely low cost and ease of adding a manual boost controller a particular draw for extra power at low cost compared to more comprehensive modifications. Users should carefully consider how installing any boost controller may affect and interact with existing complex engine management systems. Additional boost levels may not be tolerated by the existing turbocharger, causing faster wear. Fuel injectors or the fuel pump may not be able to deliver additional fuel needed for higher air flow and power of higher boost pressure. Or the engine management system may not be able to properly compensate for fuel or ignition timing, causing knock and/or engine failure.  Past and future  There are other outdated methods of boost control, such as intake restriction or bleed off. For instance, it is possible to install a large butterfly valve in the intake to restrict airflow as desired boost is approached. It is also possible to actually release large amounts of already compressed air similar to a blowoff valve but on a constant basis to maintain desired boost at the intake manifold. The currently popular exhaust gas bypass via wastegate is quite superior if compared to creating intake restriction or wasting energy by releasing air that has already been compressed. These methods are rarely used in modern system due to the large sacrifices in efficiency, heat, and reliability. Other methods may come into widespread use in the future, such as variable geometry turbochargers. With a sufficiently large turbine, no wastegate is necessary. Low speed response and faster spool up are then obtained using variable turbine technologies rather than a smaller turbine. These systems may replace or supplement typical wastegates as they develop. Control methods for the variable mechanical controls, such as the principles of closed loop will still apply even if they no longer involve pneumatics.

National resistance movements Civic circles in Latvia were dissatisfied with the German occupation regime and secretly plotted to reinstate democracy.

The radical nationalist organization ‚ÄúThundercross‚Äù was allied with the Germans in the first months after the invasion, however when repressed by the Germans it again started underground resistance. On August 13, 1943 members of four biggest Latvian political parties founded the Latvian Central Council. It published the outlawed publications JaunƒÅ Latvija (New Latvia) and Neatkarƒ´gƒÅ Latvija (Independent Latvia). The periodicals propagated the idea of renewing democracy in Latvia after the war. Kurelians The Latvian Central Council managed to form their own military unit, disguised as a Home Guard unit, commanded by General JƒÅnis Kurelis; the men were popularly known as Kurelians (). The unit was organized in July 28, 1944 by a directive from Veide, the administrator of Rƒ´ga township, for the officially avowed purpose of fighting Soviet partisans who had recently been dropped by parachutes in great numbers, and for the formation of German- supported Latvian partisan groups which would operate in Soviet-occupied Latvian regions. The size of the Kurelians is uncertain. Estimates range from 1,200 to 16,000, while the Germans were told that the group had only 500 men. Volunteers were attracted by word of mouth. The Kurelians expected ultimately to fight both Soviets and Nazis and to remain in Latvia as nationalist partisans if the Germans withdrew, or even to hold a part of Latvia until help arrived from the Western Allies.

In humans, it is a tumor suppressor protein involved in neurofibromatosis type II. Sequence data reveal its similarity to the ERM protein family. The name \\"merlin\\" is an acronym for \\"Moesin-Ezrin-Radixin-Like Protein\\". Gene Human merlin is coded by the gene NF2 in Chromosome 22. Mouse merlin gene is located on chromosome 11 and rat merlin gene on chromosome 17. Fruit fly merlin gene (symbol Mer) is located on chromosome 1 and shares 58% similarity to its human homologue. Other merlin-like genes are known from a wide range of animals, and the derivation of merlin is thought to be in early metazoa. Merlin is a member of the ERM family of proteins including ezrin, moesin, and radixin, which are in the protein 4.1 superfamily of proteins. Merlin is also known as schwannomin, a name derived from the most common type of tumor in the NF2 patient phenotype, the schwannoma. Structure Vertebrate merlin is a 70-kDa protein. There are 10 known isoforms of human merlin molecule (the full molecule being 595 amino acids in length). The two most common of these are also found in the mouse and are called type 1 and type 2, differing by the absence or presence of exon 16 or 17, respectively). All the known varieties have a conserved N-terminal part, which contains a FERM domain (a domain found in most cytoskeletal-membrane organizing proteins). The FERM domain is followed by an alpha-helical domain and a hydrophilic tail. Merlin can dimerize with itself and heterodimerize with other ERM family proteins.  Function  Merlin is a membrane-cytoskeleton scaffolding protein, i.e. linking actin filaments to cell membrane or membrane glycoproteins. Human merlin is predominantly found in nervous tissue, but also in several other fetal tissues, and is mainly located in adherens junctions. Its tumor suppressor properties are probably associated with contact-mediated growth inhibition. Drosophila merlin is expressed in embryonic hindgut, salivary glands, and imaginal discs, and has apparently a slightly different role than in vertebrates. The phosphorylation of serine 518 is known to alter the functional state of merlin. The signaling pathway of merlin is proposed to include several salient cell growth controlling molecules, including eIF3c, CD44, protein kinase A, and p21 activated kinases. Work in Drosophila identified Merlin as an upstream regulator of the Hippo tumor suppressor pathway, a function that is conserved in mammals. The Hippo pathway is a well conserved signalling pathway that coordinately regulates cell proliferation and apoptosis. Mutations of the NF2 gene cause a human autosomal dominant disease called neurofibromatosis type 2. It is characterized by the development of tumors of the nervous system, most commonly of bilateral vestibular schwannomas (also called acoustic neuromas). NF2 belongs to the tumor suppressor group of genes.  Interactions  Merlin (protein) has been shown to interact with: * CUL4A, * DDB1, * EZR, * HGS, * MED28, * RIT1, * SDCBP, * SPTBN1, and * VPRBP.

There are also other mechanical watches like HMT Pilot, HMT Jhalak (Semi Skeletal), HMT Sona, HMT Braille. HMT Janata. HMT Braille watch for visually impaired The semi-skeletal HMT Jhalak. HMT watches manufactured this skeleton watch based on 8N24 movement. In 1972, HMT expanded its watch manufacturing capacity with a set up alongside the Bangalore Factory to manufacture additional watches. In 1975, Watch factory at Bangalore was further expanded to manufacture Main Spring, Hair spring and Shock absorber components. HMT set up additional manufacturing facilities to produce watch components sets at Tumkur and Ranibagh in the year 1978 and 1985 respectively. Watch factory at Tumkur was partially converted to manufacture Quartz Analog Watches in collaboration with M/S Citizen Watch Co, Japan. To cater to the Niche market, a specialised watch case manufacturing facility was set up at Bangalore in 1983. A photograph of quartz wrist watch by HMT. Since 1985, HMT Watches had been involved in making Floral Clocks, Solar Clocks, International Clocks and Tower Clocks, most popular among them being the Garden clock in Bangalore. In the year 2000, HMT Watch Business group was re-structured as HMT Watches Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of HMT Limited. In September 2014, the Government of India decided to shut down HMT operations in a phased manner. By late 2016, the website for HMT watches was pulled down. This would soon prove to be a temporary move as there arose a newfound demand for mechanical hand wound and automatic watches made by the company, both in India and overseas. This sudden increase in demand was due in part to the appearance of pre-owned HMT watches on online platforms such as eBay where they were being sold at prices several times higher than recent retail prices. Moreover, there has been a growing new interest in Indian watches such as HMT and Titan overseas ever since watch review channels started reviewing them on YouTube. The HMT Watches website was functioning again by the end of 2019, although a notification was put up to inform online visitors that HMT watches would now only be sold online and at select factory- owned brick and mortar stores. Takeover In September 2016, Government of India closed some divisions of HMT: HMT Watches Ltd, HMT Bearings, HMT Tractors, and HMT Chinar Watches Ltd. The main reasons were that the company was making losses for more than a decade. During 2012-13, the company had losses of Rs 242 crore on revenues of only Rs 11 crore. In contrast, competitor Titan's watch business reported sales of Rs 1,675 crore during the same year. The government also tried restructuring it in 1999 to improve its finances but the company continued to make losses. While in the 1980s several new companies entered the market with newer designs and more modern production techniques, HMT is said to have been hobbled by slow decision making and was unable to compete. Machine tools divisions of HMT in Bangalore, Hyderabad and Kochi (Kalamassery) are still operational and catering industrial and defense sectors of India and abroad. The Government of India is mulling takeover of HMT by Ordnance Factory Board.https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons- products/durables/hmt-reopens-plant-to-make-last-batch-of- watches/articleshow/50402414.cms?from=mdrhttps://m.economictimes.com/industry/indl- goods/svs/engineering/three-hmt-firms-may-be-a-test-case-for-shuttering-more- loss-making-non-strategic-psus/articleshow/48406531.cms Operating units HMT 1811 tractor HMT Limited had 18 manufacturing units.

HMT's tractor business commenced its operations in 1971 in technical collaboration with M/s MOTOKOV, Czechoslovakia. HMT started the operation with the manufacture of 25 HP tractor at the manufacturing plant in Pinjore, Haryana state. Over the years, it has developed tractors ranging from 25 HP to 75 HP. Machine tools divisions of HMT is still continuing its operations and introducing state of the art technologies in Indian industrial market. The Kalamassery unit has entered manufacturing equipments for Indian Naval defence sector by manufacturing Directing Gear systems.

It was financed by the interests behind the Anaconda Copper Mining Company and operated primarily to carry copper ore from the mines at Butte, Montana to the smelters at Anaconda, Montana, although the company was chartered as a common carrier and also carried passengers and general freight. Early years The BA&P; was an electrification pioneer, converting in 1913 and being the first primarily freight railroad to electrify. Electrification was at 2,400 volts DC; the work was performed by General Electric and the railroad's own staff. As described in a period article: The electrification was abandoned in 1967 as it had become cheaper to operate diesel-electric locomotives. Many resources of the railway were included in the Butte, Anaconda and Pacific Railway Historic District, which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. Business sold GP7, retains its Rarus Railway scheme as of 2019. The railroad as a whole lost much of its business following the closure of the Anaconda smelters, and in 1985 was sold to a consortium of local investors and reconstituted as the Rarus Railway .

It is located on O'Farrell Street in the Tenderloin neighborhood on the same block as the Mitchell Brothers O'Farrell Theatre. It is known for its decorative balconies, columns, and frescoes and for its history of unique entertainment, which has included burlesque dancing as well as jazz, folk music, and rock and roll concerts. The capacity of the hall is 470 people. History  Blanco's and Music Box  The hall was established in 1907 during the period of rebuilding that followed the 1906 earthquake. Its interior was designed by a French architect. It was originally called Blanco's, after a notorious Barbary Coast house of prostitution. In 1936, Sally Rand, known for her fan dance and bubble dance acts, acquired the property and branded it the Music Box. It closed with the end of World War II, reopened in 1948 as a jazz club that reused the name Blanco's, and in the 1950s the building was used by members of the Loyal Order of the Moose. The venue went into a long decline that nearly resulted in the demolition of the building.  Great American Music Hall  In 1972 the venue was purchased by Tom Bradshaw. Newly refurbished and painted, the building was renamed the Great American Music Hall. In 1973-1974 the Stuart Little Band became the GAMH house band and performed as opening act for many GAMH headliners: Cal Tjader, Sarah Vaughan, Carmen McRae, Marcel Marceau, Stan Getz, Mongo Santamaria, Dizzy Gillespie, pianist Bill Evans, Jerry Garcia & Merl Saunders, Joe Pass, Cleo Laine, Herbie Mann, Buddy Rich, The Tubes, etc. In 1974, the new line-up of Journey debuted there, also Jerry Garcia of the Grateful Dead debuted and recorded a live album with Legion of Mary, his jazz influenced rock band in 1974, and again later with the Jerry Garcia Band as well as The Grateful Dead's album One from the Vault. In 1982, Robin Williams filmed his HBO special, \\"An Evening with Robin Williams\\". In the early '90s, radio station KKSF 103.7FM hosted several large \\"Music Without Borders Listener Appreciation Concerts\\", with performances by Opafire as well as other Contemporary Jazz groups. In May 2000, during the dot-com boom, the venue was acquired for a reportedly seven-figure sum by music website Riffage.com, and went to Diablo Management Group when Riffage.com ceased operations in December 2000. Traditional burlesque was brought back to the Great American Music Hall when the Velvet Hammer Burlesque troupe performed in 2003 and 2004. In 2013, the Great American Music Hall was named the sixth-best rock club in America in a Rolling Stone poll of artists and managers.

She is best known for her collaboration with Eg White under the name and Alice. She is also notable for having been the first female UK and European BMX champion. BMX In her teens, Temple was the first female UK and European BMX champion. Tim March, ex-European BMX Champion, has said of Temple \\"She was the first Shanaze, she beat the boys easy\\". Music Temple began her music career with Eg White, founding member of 80s boyband Brother Beyond, at the age of twenty. Their collaboration, and Alice, released only one album, 24 Years of Hunger (1991), but this was described by Allmusic as \\"one of the finest, most refined and fully realized recordings of the era, employing a much more sophisticated and romantic style than anything else out of England at the time\\". Allmusic also notes the accolades that 24 Years of Hunger received from other music critics: : \\"Recorded by the pair when they were mere twentysomethings, and predominantly in White's home, it is nevertheless about as grown-up and elegant as pop music gets. A decade after the recording had all but vanished from circulation, rainsound.net had taken to calling it \\"one of the classic albums of the '90s,\\" while Q Magazine went a step further when it placed the record on its list of best albums of the 20th century, describing it as having \\"the class of Steely Dan and the intriguing detachment of the Blue Nile.\\" While writing and collaborating with White, Temple caught the attention of James Lavelle of the electronic group UNKLE. She was then brought in to contribute to UNKLE's Psyence Fiction album. Her piece for the album, Bloodstain, won critical acclaim. Temple is also featured on the track Mistress, the B-side of the UNKLE single Burn my Shadow. The same track appeared on some editions of UNKLE's third album War Stories. In 1999 Temple returned to working with White, and together they put together her debut solo album Hang Over, released on V2. In 2005 Temple joined co-songwriter Lucie Bar√¢t to form the band The Fay Wrays, with Temple on guitar and vocals. After 24 Years of Hunger, White concentrated mainly on songwriting and production, in which he was highly successful, but he also released two solo albums. His 2009 album, Adventure Man, included the song Pull Me Through, described in the pre-release sleeve notes as \\"a beautiful, harrowing ballad of survival written and sung nearly completely by Alice Temple... which was a way of 'closing the circle'\\". In 2008 Temple wrote, recorded and produced a second solo album entitled Be With You in A Minute, which she released on her own label. Modelling Temple modelled in the mid 1980s, and was photographed by Mario Testino, Nick Knight and Bruce Weber. She appeared on the cover of i-D magazine in May 1986, and in another feature in 2009. Personal life Temple was noted as a friend of Boy George during the 1980s. They were both part of London's Blitz Kids scene, which is credited with launching the New Romantic cultural movement. She is believed to be the subject of George's song A Boy Called Alice, on his 1988 UK CD single Don't Cry, in which she can be heard declaring \\"My name's Alice and I am not a boy\\".

Launched by a group of journalists who left Kurir and published by the company they established called Press Publishing Group, Press quickly developed sizable readership, reaching high circulation in the process. In time, the company parleyed the daily's market success into other print media projects such as another daily Biznis, aimed at business people, as well as a lifestyle weekly magazine Lola and a glossy monthly magazine FAME. For years, much like many other Serbian media outlets, the paper faced speculation and accusations about its ownership structure. Rumours about the Press' real owners being some of Serbia's most powerful politically connected business tycoons was rampant with individuals like Miroslav Mi≈°koviƒá and Dragan ƒêilas often mentioned in this regard. The daily was shut down in November 2012 amid great controversy that played out in the Serbian media when tycoon Miroslav Mi≈°koviƒá announced his pull-out from the paper's ownership structure, thereby confirming his long-speculated association with the paper. Ownership The Press owners controlled the paper through an entity named Press Publishing Group d.o.o. which was registered in Serbia as a limited liability company in mid October 2006.https://web.archive.org/web/20090617081140/http://regpr.komora.net/Detaljioprivrednomsubjektu/tabid/63/id/20208961/privredniSubjektID/20208961/Default.aspx Initially, it was co-owned by the three parties: Amber Press Limited company from Cyprus (50%), individual ƒêorƒëe Stefanoviƒá (40%), and Mediavox d.o.o. company from Belgrade (10%). However, since Mediavox is also owned by Stefanoviƒá, Press Publishing Group was essentially a 50-50 joint venture between Stefanoviƒá and Cypriot Amber Press. The company quickly established itself on the Serbian media market, receiving accolades(E Magazin) Munjevit razvoj kompanije Press Publishing Group pru≈æio je primer kolegama iz novinarske bran≈°e, E-Kapija, December 13, 2007 and posting good business returns. According to its 2007 annual financial report submitted to the Serbian Economic Register Agency, the company had 136 employees and it posted an annual profit of RSD58,830,000 (approximately ‚Ç¨ 0.7 million at the time) for the calendar year 2007.http://pretraga.apr.gov.rs/RepsisPublicSite/Public/Enterprise/AnnualFinancialReport.aspx?BusinessEntityId=1109769&RegistryCode;=20208961&rnd;=2122029498 Finasijski izvestaj za 2007 Then in May 2009, the ownership was restructured with Stefanoviƒá's 40% stake divided amongst 4 individuals: Biljana Kralj (22%), ƒêoko Kesiƒá (6%), Dragan J. Vuƒçiƒáeviƒá (6%), and Svetomir Marjanoviƒá (6%). Over the years, there were frequent speculation about the identity of the individuals behind the companies listed in the Press ownership structure. Serbian tycoons and businessmen Miroslav Mi≈°koviƒá and Dragan ƒêilas were often mentioned in this regard. On 12 November 2012, that speculation was confirmed when politically influential Serbian tycoon Miroslav Mi≈°koviƒá announced his decision to sell his stake in the paper, admitting in the process that he was the paper largest individual stakeholder.Mi≈°koviƒá: Povlaƒçim se iz vlasni≈°tva u \\"Presu\\" Reacting to Mi≈°koviƒá's announcement, Serbian deputy prime minister Aleksandar Vuƒçiƒá claimed that Serbian businessman and the mayor of Belgrade Dragan ƒêilas also owns a large stake in the paper and called on him to publicly admit it.Vuƒçiƒá: I ƒêilas je suvlasnik Presa ;Blic, 13 November 2012 History In mid December 2005, Press became the latest in a growing series of Serbian print media publications that came into existence due to a group of journalists leaving their previous place of employment en masse to start a new paper. This is how Vreme weekly was started in 1990 (left Politika), Na≈°a borba in 1994 (left Borba), and Glas javnosti in 1998 (left Blic). In this case, the majority of Press staffers including editor-in-chief ƒêoko Kesiƒá and his deputy Dragan J. Vuƒçiƒáeviƒá had worked at Kurir from its inception in May 2003 until early December 2005. At that time a dispute over revenue sharing came to a head, resulting in about 90% of Kurir's staff leaving the paper. Public accusations of corruption and political skullduggery started flying thick and fast between Kurir owner Radisav Rodiƒá on one side and Kesiƒá- Vuƒçiƒáeviƒá editing duo on the other. During mid December 2005, Vuƒçiƒáeviƒá and newly named Kurir editor-in-chief Antonije Kovaƒçeviƒá even publicly squared off in an impromptu TV duel on BKTV's talk-show Klopka hosted by Olivera Kovaƒçeviƒá (no relation to Antonije Kovaƒçeviƒá), but apart from a lot of shouting and theatrical rhetoric not many concrete facts were established. Led by Kesiƒá and Vuƒçiƒáeviƒá, the group that left Kurir announced their plan to start their own daily tabloid named Dnevni kurir, however, Kurir owner Rodiƒá immediately filed a complaint with Trade Court, protesting copyright infringement. The court agreed with him and issued an immediate junction prohibiting publication under that name. Though they felt Kurir became what it is in large part due to their own efforts and skills, Kesiƒá & Vuƒçiƒáeviƒá decided not to pursue the matter further legally and ended the issue by naming their new tabloid Press, instead. Its premiere issue came out on 15 December 2005. Press vs. Bojan Kri≈°to In late November 2008, Press began running a series of articles about Bojan Kri≈°to, CEO of the state-owned company JP Aerodrom Beograd which operates Belgrade's Nikola Tesla Airport. The issue was his free-spending business practice when it came to approving salary bonuses for himself and members of the company's managing board. Since by the nature of the position, Kri≈°to was politically delegated by G17 Plus, a member party of the ruling coalition For a European Serbia (ZES), the whole thing soon erupted into a political scandal. Opposition MPs demanded his resignation along with pressing criminal charges while even the President of Serbia Boris Tadiƒá chimed in, calling the situation unacceptable. Much of the public's anger was directed at Kri≈°to's party boss Mlaƒëan Dinkiƒá who was also the Minister of Economy and Regional Development as well as the Deputy Prime Minister. For a while it even appeared that this was the beginning of a rift in the Serbian ruling coalition and some even went as far as suggesting that together with other disagreements between government members such as the Russian gas deal, this airport case might just make the government fall. No such thing happened, however, as Kri≈°to resigned on 25 November 2008 under the weight of public pressureBojan Kri≈°to podneo ostavku, Press, November 25, 2008 while Dinkiƒá went on B92 programme Utisak nedelje on 30 November 2008 and more or less defended his party colleague.Dinkiƒá: Kri≈°to nije kriv, B92, November 30, 2008 Dinkiƒá repeatedly referred to the entire episode as \\"witch hunt\\" and even suggested that part of the motivation for Press to go after Kri≈°to might lay in his apparent decision to make them pay the outstanding sum on the sponsorship deal that allowed the Press logo to be printed on the back of boarding passes issued at the airport. The very next day Press responded to this by saying they will present Dinkiƒá with all the details of that particular business deal and demand that he issue a public apology for the \\"libelous remark\\".Kriv mu Press, Press, December 1, 2008 Closing On 15 November 2012, in the wake of Miroslav Mi≈°koviƒá's announcement of his pulling out of the paper, the paper announced that day's issue to be its last in print. It was also said on the same occasion that the issue for Republika Srpska would continue as well as the website.Dnevni list \\"Press\\" prestaje da izlazi;Blic, 15 November 2012 According to unofficial sources, the paper accrued debts of more than ‚Ç¨16 million at the time of its folding.Mi≈°koviƒá i ƒêilas ugasili ‚ÄûPress‚Äú? Ostao dug od 16 miliona evra ;pravda.rs, 15 November 2012 Mi≈°koviƒá's implicit admission of owning a stake in Press when he announced his pullout from the paper as well as the publication's demise three days later, caused a lot of reaction and controversy on the Serbian media scene as well as in the country's wider public. It again opened the issue of the real ownership behind Serbian print and electronic media outlets. Reaction to the paper's demise Ljiljana Smajloviƒá Ljiljana Smajloviƒá, president of the Serbian Journalists' Association (UNS) said: \\"UNS supports the Press employees' demands of getting to the bottom of everything when it comes to Press ‚Äî who were their real owners, what was the paper's circulation, and why weren't they given the opportunity to put together a newspaper the way they wanted to. UNS further appeals on the creditors of Press to show understanding of the situation the paper's employees find themselves in and to exercise restraint considering Miroslav Mi≈°koviƒá's publicly stated promise to pay off most of the paper's outstanding debts. UNS is further criticizing the current Serbian government (led by Daƒçiƒá and Vuƒçiƒá) for not delivering on one of its first promises upon taking office ‚Äî discussing Verica Baraƒá's report that clearly identified murky ownership structure of media outlets as the biggest threat to press freedom in Serbia. If it doesn't determine once and for all why the Serbian media market turned into Wild West where everybody deceives everybody when it comes to ownership structure and circulation figures, this government will share the responsibility for the situation with the previous one. It would be good if the Press' other owner ‚Äî the still clandestine one ‚Äî finally owned up and took responsibility for the paper's finances thereby helping the journalists re- form their newspaper, hopefully this time without debts to tycoons\\".Smajloviƒá: Ga≈°enje \\"Pressa\\" lo≈°a vest;mondo.rs, 15 November 2012Press do daljeg samo onlajn ;Press, 15 November 2012 Dragan J. Vuƒçiƒáeviƒá At the 15 November 2012 press-conference he called over a different issue, former Press editor- in-chief, columnist, and one of the paper's founders Dragan J. Vuƒçiƒáeviƒá (at the time the editor-in-chief of Informer) took several questions about the paper's demise. He said on the occasion: \\"Towards the end of 2010, Press got hijacked and taken away from me and the other founders by the people from top echelons of the authorities that ran Serbia at the time. They basically blackmailed us with the threat of laying off the 250 staffers that were employed at the paper at the time as well as the threat of making sure our loans don't get re-programmed. From the second half of 2010 until I eventually left in late December 2011 when they wouldn't allow me to continue writing my column, I was neither involved in the paper's business nor its editorial policy. All I did for the paper in 2010 and 2011 was writing a weekly column. Yes, I was listed at the same time as the managing board president of the Press Publishing Group, but it was only a formal title by the decision of some people that made decisions at the time ‚Äî in reality I had nothing to do with the managing board, which by the way didn't even exist, and I'm not the right man to talk to about what went on in that paper during its last three years of existence. Yes, I was fictitiously listed as the managing board president. As far as Oliver Duliƒá and the payments from his environmental fund go, I learned of those only after I had already left Press. I had nothing to do with him. If you prove that I ever met him, signed any of his payments, or even talked to him over the phone I'll gladly go to jail. I never took a dinar from Duliƒá or anyone else from the Tadiƒá authorities. I only suffered under those authorities. During the Tadiƒá era in Serbia, only a few journalists dared to put up consistent and resolute resistance to his tyrannical rule and I feel that resisting Tadiƒá and his cronies is one of the greatest highlights of my career in journalism. Especially under the circumstances when other journalists kept silent while cashing in their integrity from Duliƒá and other characters like Cole, Krle, and ≈†ane\\".Vucicevic press'conference; 15 November 2012 This was in stark contrast to what Vuƒçiƒáeviƒá had to say on the same subject two years earlier in December 2010. Asked at the time about the Serbian tycoons' alleged clandestine involvement in the Serbian newspapers' ownership structure, Vuƒçiƒáeviƒá, the managing board president of Press Publishing Group, answered: \\"In Serbia there are constant conspiracy theories about different tycoons having a stake in various newspapers. That's not exactly the case and I'll tell why it isn't. The newspaper business in Serbia is not profitable enough for tycoons to be interested in it. They can turn much greater profits in other endeavours so why would they invest in newspapers. Do you know how long it takes to start making a profit on your investment in a newspaper? Between 5-7 years. Why would someone invest ‚Ç¨1 million in a newspaper and then wait for 7 years to make that money back\\". Asked explicitly on the same occasion who owns Press, Vuƒçiƒáeviƒá answered: \\"Press is owned by ƒêoko Kesiƒá, Sveta Marjanoviƒá, Biljana Kralj, and myself\\". Pressed further to say who is politically behind Press, Vuƒçiƒáeviƒá emphatically repeated: \\"No one\\".Dragan J.

The film was produced with a budget of $16.8 millionRob-B-Hood Budget and filmed between December 2005 and January 2006. Rob-B-Hood is the first film in over 30 years in which Jackie Chan plays an anti-hero. Rob-B-Hood tells the story of a kidnapping gone wrong in Hong Kong; a trio of burglars consisting of Thongs (Chan), Octopus (Koo) and the Landlord (Hui) kidnap a baby from a wealthy family on behalf of triads. With the Landlord arrested, Thongs and Octopus take care of the baby for a short time, developing strong bonds with him. Reluctant to hand the baby over, the two are forced to protect him from the triads who hired them in the first place. Rob-B-Hood was released in Hong Kong, China and Southeast Asia on 29 September 2006 based in Hong Kong to generally positive reviews. The film topped the Chinese box office in October 2006 and despite not being given a release in most European and North American countries, it grossed over US$20 million worldwide.  Plot  Friends Thongs and Octopus evade security guards in a hospital, having stolen money and cancer medication from the safe. Meanwhile, a newborn baby to the wealthy Lee family is snatched by Max, the mother's ex-boyfriend, prompting the security guards give chase, ignoring the burglars, and corner Max on an escalator. Following a violent struggle, Max and the baby fall over the side‚Äîthe baby is caught by Thongs, while Max plummets to his death. While the guards are distracted, Thongs and Octopus leave in the Landlord's minivan. A few months later, the Landlord finds his flat burgled, his life savings gone. He receives a phone call from his middleman Uncle Seven, offering him a job to kidnap baby Lee on behalf of a triad boss, who claims the baby is his grandson. Enticed by the HK$7 million reward, Thongs and Octopus accept the job without knowing its objectives, finding out only after the Landlord has fled the Lees' mansion with the baby. Disgusted by the idea of kidnapping a baby, Thongs threatens to return him, but relents after the Landlord tells him of his predicament. En route to their rendezvous point in Sai Kung, the trio encounter a police road block which the Landlord attempts to outrun, only to crash his van down a hill. As the police close in on them, the stuck Landlord instructs Thongs and Octopus to leave with the baby. While in custody for reckless driving, the Landlord learns of the baby's value through the news. He phones Thongs, instructing him not to hand the baby over to anyone prior to his release so he can jack up the price. Over the next few days, Thongs and Octopus take care of the baby, developing a strong bond with him. The two begin to regret their vices: Thongs resists the urge to gamble, while Octopus feels sorry for cheating on his wife. Meanwhile, both the triads and the police are after the baby. The triad boss, enraged by the non-delivery of his \\"grandson\\", sends his men to retrieve the baby from Thongs' flat. Confronted by both the triads and Police Inspector Mok, Thongs and Octopus go into hiding with the baby. Shortly after his release, the Landlord is brought to the triad boss, who increases his offer to HK$30 million for the baby. He finds Thongs and Octopus at the hospital, where the baby is being treated for fever. The Landlord informs the two of the triads' latest offer, but Thongs and Octopus are more concerned about the baby's welfare than the cash. However, the two agree to bring the baby to the triad boss' mansion, where the Landlord will meet them with the rest of the money. They reach the triad boss' mansion and hand over the baby reluctantly. As the trio are about to leave, they hear the baby crying for them as a blood sample is taken from his arm. Thongs and Octopus experience a flashback of the days they spent with the baby. Overcome by their feelings, they fight their way into the triad boss' private amusement park to recover the baby while the Landlord leaves with the money. Thongs almost manages to escape with the baby, but is forced to surrender when the triads threaten to hurl Octopus to his death. Thongs and Octopus are taken to the triad boss, who insists the baby is his grandson, only to be proven wrong by the blood test. Driven mad, the boss places the baby in a deep freeze room next to Max's corpse so the baby can be with his son, prompting Thongs and Octopus to fight for the baby. The two end up trapped in the room with two minions, but are saved when Inspector Mok arrives with the Landlord, who swiftly cracks the lock to the room. Thongs and Octopus run to the garage with the comatose baby, where Thongs attempts to revive him with a makeshift defibrillator powered by a car battery from a Pagani Zonda by holding onto the crocodile clips with his bare hands. Despite his efforts, the baby does not come to and is driven off in an ambulance, where his heart is found to be beating weakly. Imprisoned for kidnapping, Thongs, Octopus and the Landlord volunteer for a mock capital punishment demonstration during an open day, using the opportunity to apologise to their loved ones. After the demonstration, Inspector Mok informs the three that their sentences have been further reduced by the Department of Justice. Thongs, Octopus, and the Landlord then see the baby alive and well with his parents. As a token of appreciation for saving the baby's life, Thongs, Octopus and the Landlord are offered jobs by the Lee family as a bodyguard, chauffeur and head of security respectively.

Chan has starred in over 50 action films, and has intimated in recent years that he has grown tired of being typecast as the \\"nice guy\\". The film is notable as the first in over 30 years, in which he plays a negative character‚Äîa criminal and compulsive gambler.  Writing  Jackie Chan contacted Benny Chan shortly after the release of New Police Story to discuss plans for a new action film. Chan stated that he did not want to play the typical nice guy role that has been the staple of his previous films. Eventually, Benny Chan and scriptwriter Alan Yuen came up with a daring idea: Chan will play Thongs, a petty criminal who has fallen out with his family over his gambling habit. Benny Chan had originally intended for Jackie to play a full-fledged villain, who \\"hits women and burns people with cigarettes\\". However, the script was toned down to appease the Chinese censors, who found the character to be too evil. Nevertheless, for only the third time in his acting career, Chan plays a character who is sentenced to prison. Chan co-wrote the film and designed the action sequences, whilst director Benny Chan wrote the film's dramatic elements, completing the script by October 2005. Two additional protagonists were designed as Thongs' partners in crime, with the intention of increasing the comedic value of the film through their interactions. The film's Chinese title is Bo Bui Gai Wak (Cantonese: ÂØ∂Ë≤ùË®àÂäÉ, literally Project BB, with \\"BB\\" being a homophone for \\"Baby\\"), a reference to Chan's award-winning 1983 film Project A (Cantonese: A Gai Wak, AË®àÂäÉ).  Casting  The cast of Rob-B-Hood includes actors ranging from newcomer Gao Yuanyuan to veteran actor Chen Baoguo. Daniel Wu and Nicholas Tse, stars of New Police Story, make cameo appearances as homosexual security van drivers during a car chase in the film. Octopus, Thong's partner in crime, is played by Louis Koo, an award-winning actor with past appearances including the TVB drama series Detective Investigation Files IV and the films Election and Election 2. Although Koo co- starred with Jackie Chan, a number of action scenes involving his character were shot with a stunt double. In addition, Koo was the baby's favourite on set‚ÄîWhenever the baby cried, Koo was always the first to cheer him up. The Landlord, the leader of Thongs and Octopus, is played by Michael Hui, a Hong Kong Film Award-winning comedic actor who starred in various box office hits from 1970s to 1990s before emigrating to Canada shortly before the handover of Hong Kong. Hui was chosen for the part because he is the ideal actor to play a character who persuades others to do bad things. The producers had originally intended Hui to fight along with Chan and Koo, however, it was eventually decided that Hui would simply act as the brains of the gang. Rob-B-Hood features a collaboration between Jackie Chan and Yuen Biao. The pair, along with Sammo Hung, were Peking Opera School classmates and co-starred in a number of action comedy films in the 1980s, including Project A, Wheels on Meals, and the Lucky Stars trilogy. Chan had originally intended to co-star with both Yuen and Hung, reuniting the trio for the first time since 1988 film Dragons Forever. However, Hung declined due to a scheduling conflicts. Yuen Biao plays the role of Police Inspector Steve Mok, assigned to investigate the baby's disappearance. Some of Yuen's past antics were revisited in Rob-B-Hood, including a fight in which he tried in vain to handcuff Chan's character. Over 100 auditions were held before the suitable baby was found to star in the film. Benny Chan chose Matthew Medvedev, a one-year-old infant of Chinese and Colombian descent. Medvedev, known as Baby Matthew, was literally recruited off the street when an assistant director spotted him with his parents on the MTR. Although his family was simply visiting Hong Kong, they agreed to stay and let Matthew appear in Rob-B-Hood.  Filming  Rob-B-Hood is the third Jackie Chan film directed by Benny Chan, following Who Am I? and New Police Story. Filming took place in Hong Kong between December 2005 and April 2006 with a budget of HK$16.8 million. Filming locations included Central, Sai Kung District, Sha Tin, Hong Kong Ocean Park, Cyberport, Tai Po Waterfront Park and Victoria Prison. Benny Chan described the filming process as some of the darkest days of his career, explaining that the baby was a factor beyond his control, and could not work more than eight hours a day. Whenever a scene involving the baby was shot, the crew members had to be silent, communicating in sign language. Benny Chan stated it took time, patience, and money to guide the baby through each shot, and numerous retakes were required due to the baby's constant crying and napping. As a result, production went over budget. Special methods were sometimes used to coax the baby into co-operation. One scene required the baby to suckle Chan's nipple. The baby was initially hesitant, but relented after the crew brushed a large amount of honey onto the nipple. Jackie Chan was the stunt director of Rob-B-Hood, having choreographed all the stunts with the Jackie Chan Stunt Team. He continued his tradition of performing his own stunts in the film, for example, jumping between several air-conditioners on the outer wall of a tall building to reach the ground. Several scenes required Chan to co-ordinate his stunts with the baby, including a car chase around the Sha Tin industrial area, in which he managed to snatch the baby away seconds before a car crashed into him; and a scene in Ocean Park in which he climbed on the underside of a roller coaster with the baby in hand. Chan suffered minor injuries attempting stunts in the film, having been kicked in the chest by a stuntman wearing the wrong boots and fallen off a quad bike, while attempting to perform a wheelie. Chan's combat choreography included the use of improvised weapons in combat; when he fought a pair of skilled henchmen in a deep freeze room, he defeated them by spraying them with milk and then using a large fan to blast them with cold air.  Releases  Rob-B-Hood had its world premiere at the Venice Film Festival on 8 September 2006. After the film's premiere at the Venice Film Festival, several scenes highlighting the personal relationships between characters were deleted from Rob-B-Hood prior to its release to the general public. Benny Chan explains that including too many dramatic scenes may distract the audience from the plot. The uncut version of Rob-B-Hood is included in the DVD release as the \\"Extended Version\\" feature. The cut version of the film was released simultaneously in Hong Kong, China, Singapore, Malaysia and other Southeast Asian countries on 29 September. Afterwards, Rob-B-Hood was released in Japan on 7 April 2007. Greece remains the only European country in which Rob-B-Hood was released, on 13 February 2007. The film is rated IIA in Hong Kong (unsuitable for children), G in Singapore and U in Malaysia. The Japanese title of Rob-B-Hood is „Éó„É≠„Ç∏„Çß„ÇØ„ÉàBB (Purojekuto BB), literally Project BB, the name initially proposed for the film. In Greece, the film is known as ŒëœÉœçŒªŒªŒ∑œÄœÑŒøŒπ ŒëœÄŒ±œÑŒµœéŒΩŒµœÇ (transliteration: Asulliptoi Apateones), meaning Inconceivable Frauds. In the United States, the film is known as Robin-B-Hood.  DVD  The first pressing of the DVD was released in Hong Kong in November 2006 on Region 0. This has since been discontinued and the subsequent standard and limited edition releases were on Region 3. All Hong Kong versions contain two discs: a movie disc and an extras disc. The movie disc features both the cinematic and uncut versions of the film, along with a commentary track by Benny Chan. The extras disc contains a \\"behind-the-scenes\\" video, the post-production press conference, a collection of deleted scenes and the music video of the theme song. The limited edition DVD is housed in a box-file style box and contains various pieces of merchandise including branded sandals and door signs. An even more limited release of 5000 units was briefly available, and handed out at various film festivals. This edition contained a crystal dummy, an imitation bank note and a branded 2007 calendar in addition to the merchandise in the other limited edition release. The DVD was later released in other East Asian countries, including China (Region 6), Japan (Region 2), South Korea, Thailand and Malaysia (Region 3). On 26 December 2007, the DVD was released in the US (Region 1) by Dragon Dynasty in a \\"two-disc ultimate edition\\", which contains much of the same extras as the Hong Kong releases, including the commentary by Benny Chan, though with US trailers replacing the domestic ones. However, the runtime for this release is 126:28, which is somewhere between the theatrical cut (121:46) and the director's cut (135:11) on the Hong Kong releases. On 24 May 2010, DVD was released by Cine Asia in a two-disc ultimate edition at the United Kingdom in Region 2.  Reception  Rob-B-Hood was generally well received by critics. Jay Weissberg of Variety described the film as \\"a mildly fun ride that banked on Jackie's tried-and- true comic charm in a standard baby kidnapping farce enlivened by just enough action sequences to keep hoary diaper scenes from soiling the playpen\\". Credit was given to the stunt choreography and the acting partnership of Jackie Chan and Louis Koo, although some reviewers were disappointed about the absence of Sammo Hung. The plot of Rob-B-Hood received mixed reviews: The Chinese newspaper Xiao Xiang Chen Bao found it concise, hilarious and touching, whereas Jay Weissberg criticised it for being unoriginal. In addition, Felix Cheong of Channel NewsAsia found the subplots involving the antagonists' families redundant, detracting from the main story and making the film \\"tediously long\\". However, Chan was praised for his decision to play a darker character in Rob-B-Hood. Andrew Sun of South China Morning Post stated that \\"one of the best things Chan can do for his flagging movie career is to play a heavy‚Äîa nasty, scum-of-the-earth antagonist, since you do not always have to play a hero to be a hero.\\" Sun emphasised the need for Chan to show flexibility in his roles, citing a number of actors that have thrived by playing the occasional villain.  Box office  Rob-B-Hood grossed HK$1.2 million the day it was released in Hong Kong. In China, the film topped the box office during the four-day National Day holiday weekend, grossing ¬•8.9 million. It went on to top the Chinese box office in October with box office figures exceeding ¬•90 million. Rob-B-Hood performed well in Southeast Asia, grossing US$404,000 in Singapore, US$400,000 in Malaysia and US$604,000 in Thailand during its first four days. In total, Rob-B-Hood had a worldwide gross of US$20,434,179 despite not being released in North America and most of Europe.

He was born in Neuilly-sur-Seine (Hauts-de-Seine), on 24 July 1949 and is the third child to be born in the family. Duteil is a noted proponent of the French language, the rights of children and the respect of environment. Duteil is the mayor of Pr√©cy-sur- Marne in Seine et Marne.  Recordings  In 1972, Yves Duteil had first minor hit with a song called \\"Virages\\" (). Included on his 1974 debut album L'√âcritoire, it shares fame with such songs as the title track and from his next album, \\"J'attends\\" (1976), \\"Tisserand\\", \\"Les Batignolles\\" (an area of Paris), etc. His 1977 album \\"Tarentelle\\", which would become his most classic, included not only his most famous song (\\"Prendre un Enfant\\") but also such songs as the title track, \\"Le Petit Pont de Bois\\", \\"Le Mur De La Prison D'En Face\\" which have all become classics. Duteil's ability to write love-filled, touching lyrics on sweet or catchy melodies have made him a singer much more loved than he is adulated by the public. He is probably not the first one to have achieved to stay outside of the show business spirit while managing to be very popular, after all Hugues Aufray did this too. But this is probably a touching side to know the man lives the simple life of a husband and father, doing concerts which are closer to a friendly grouping where pure emotions are shared. In 2001, Duteil released \\"Sans Attendre\\", more introspective than ever and with much modesty, he tackles some aspects of his life in a way that can bring a deep sight on life, understood in the light of spiritual love. In a simple way, he sings about friendship in tough times (\\"Les Gestes D√©licats\\"), compassion for a father who never showed him that much affection, which never prevents Duteil to answer with love and sings all the kind words he found to his father, no matter what his childhood was like (\\"Lettre √Ä Mon P√®re\\"). And probably the most touching song: \\"Pour Que Tu Ne Meures Pas\\", which, for those who understand the lyrics, will bring tears of emotion as it deals with Yves Duteil's wife's disease, still in a very modest way and which brings a deep joy and belief in life and love as so much love is contained in this song. This is probably one of the most love filled, hope filled recording he has made. And leaves us, at the end of the listening, with a smile of joy and thankfulness that life is such a wonderful gift. In Germany songs of Duteil are interpreted in French and German language by the Belgo-German singer Didier Caesar of the quartet St√©phane & Didier et Cie, who has translated in German the songs \\"La tarentelle\\" (Die Tarantella), \\"La puce et le pianiste\\" (Der Floh und der Pianist), \\"Lucile et les libelulles\\" (Sibyll und die Libellen), \\"Il me manquait toujours\\" (Es fehlt mir immer noch) and \\"Prendre un enfant par la main\\" (Nimm ein Kind an deine Hand). This song had been translated and sung in 2001 by the famous German Liedermacher Reinhard Mey with his title \\"Gib einem Kind deine Hand\\". The German song texts can be found on website www.deutsche-chanson-texte.de. Duteil has written a total of 208 songs to current date.

Active tuberculosis can be contagious while latent tuberculosis is not, and it is therefore not possible to get TB from someone with latent tuberculosis. The main risk is that approximately 10% of these people (5% in the first two years after infection and 0.1% per year thereafter) will go on to develop active tuberculosis. This is particularly true, and there is added risk, in particular situations such as medication that suppresses the immune system or advancing age. The identification and treatment of people with latent TB is an important part of controlling this disease. Various treatment regimens are in use for latent tuberculosis. They generally need to be taken for several months. Transmission Latent disease \\"TB Bacteria Are Spread Only from a Person with Active TB Disease ... In people who develop active TB of the lungs, also called pulmonary TB, the TB skin test will often be positive. In addition, they will show all the signs and symptoms of TB disease, and can pass the bacteria to others. So, if a person with TB of the lungs sneezes, coughs, talks, sings, or does anything that forces the bacteria into the air, other people nearby may breathe in TB bacteria. Statistics show that approximately one-third of people exposed to pulmonary TB become infected with the bacteria, but only one in ten of these infected people develop active TB disease during their lifetimes.\\" However, exposure to tuberculosis is very unlikely to happen when one is exposed for a few minutes in a store or in a few minutes social contact. \\"It usually takes prolonged exposure to someone with active TB disease for someone to become infected. After exposure, it usually takes 8 to 10 weeks before the TB test would show if someone had become infected.\\" \\"Depending on ventilation and other factors, these tiny droplets [from the person who has active tuberculosis] can remain suspended in the air for several hours. Should another person inhale them, he or she may become infected with TB. The probability of transmission will be related to the infectiousness of the person with TB, the environment where the exposure occurred, the duration of the exposure, and the susceptibility of the host.\\" In fact, \\"it isn't easy to catch TB. You need consistent exposure to the contagious person for a long time. For that reason, you're more likely to catch TB from a relative than a stranger.\\" If a person had latent tuberculosis, they do not have active/contagious tuberculosis. Once exposed, people very often have latent tuberculosis. To convert to active tuberculosis, the bacteria must become active. People have medical privacy or \\"confidentiality\\" and do not have to reveal their active tuberculosis case to family, friends, or co-workers; therefore, the person who gets latent tuberculosis may never know who had the active case of tuberculosis that caused the latent tuberculosis diagnosis for them. Only by required testing (required in some jobs) {{For example, if you work in the Retirement Home industry in Ontario, Canada you are required by law to have a TB test to confirm that you do not have active TB cite - Ontario Regulation 166/11 s. 27 (8) (b) or developing symptoms of active tuberculosis and visiting a medical doctor who does testing will a person know they have been exposed. Because tuberculosis is not common in the United States, doctors may not suspect tuberculosis; therefore, they may not test. If a person has symptoms of tuberculosis, it is wise to be tested. Persons with diabetes may have an 18% chance of converting to active tuberculosis. In fact, death from tuberculosis was greater in diabetic patients. Persons with HIV and latent tuberculosis have a 10% chance of developing active tuberculosis every year. \\"HIV infection is the greatest known risk factor for the progression of latent M. tuberculosis infection to active TB. In many African countries, 30‚Äì60% of all new TB cases occur in people with HIV, and TB is the leading cause of death globally for HIV-infected people.\\" Reactivation Once a person has been diagnosed with Latent Tuberculosis (LTBI) and a medical doctor confirms no active tuberculosis, the person should remain alert to symptoms of active tuberculosis for the remainder of his or her life. Even after completing the full course of medication, there is no guarantee that the tuberculosis bacteria have all been killed.\\"When a person develops active TB (disease), the symptoms (cough, fever, night sweats, weight loss etc.) may be mild for many months. This can lead to delays in seeking care, and results in transmission of the bacteria to others.\\" Tuberculosis does not always settle in the lungs. If the outbreak of tuberculosis is in the brain, organs, kidneys, joints, or others areas, the patient may have active tuberculosis for an extended period of time before discovering that they are active. \\"A person with TB disease may feel perfectly healthy or may only have a cough from time to time.\\" However, these symptoms do not guarantee tuberculosis, and they may not exist at all, yet the patient may still have active tuberculosis. A person with symptoms listed may have active tuberculosis, and the person should immediately see a physician so that tuberculosis is not spread. If a person with the above symptoms does not see a physician, ignoring the symptoms can result in lung damage, eye damage, organ damage and eventually death. When tuberculosis settles in other organs (rather than lungs) or other parts of the body (such as the skeletal), symptoms may be different from when it settles in the lungs (such as the symptoms listed above). Thus, without the cough or flu-like symptoms, a person can unwittingly have active tuberculosis. Other symptoms include back pain, flank pain, PID symptoms, confusion, coma, difficulty swallowing, and many other symptoms that would be a part of other diseases. (Please see the reference for more information on symptoms.) Therefore, seeing a physician and asking for a tuberculosis test is absolutely necessary to rule out tuberculosis when a patient has symptoms without a diagnosis of disease. Situations in which tuberculosis may become reactivated are: * if there is onset of a disease affecting the immune system (such as AIDS) or a disease whose treatment affects the immune system (such as chemotherapy in cancer or systemic steroids in asthma or Enbrel, Humira or Orencia in rheumatoid arthritis); * malnutrition (which may be the result of illness or injury affecting the digestive system, or of a prolonged period of not eating, or disturbance in food availability such as famine, residence in refugee camp or concentration camp, or civil war); * degradation of the immune system due to aging. * certain systemic diseases such as diabetes, and \\"other conditions: debilitating disease (especially haematological and some solid cancers), long- term steroids, end-stage renal disease, silicosis and gastrectomy/jejuno-ileal bypass all confer an increased risk. * \\"Elderly patients: latent TB may reactivate in elderly patients.\\" * The very young Diagnosis There are two classes of tests commonly used to identify patients with latent tuberculosis: tuberculin skin tests and IFN-Œ≥ (Interferon-gamma) tests. The skin tests currently include the following two: :* Mantoux test :* Heaf test IFN-Œ≥ tests include the following three: :* T-SPOT.TB :* QuantiFERON-TB Gold :* QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube Tuberculin skin testing The tuberculin skin test (TST) in its first iteration, the Mantoux Test, was developed in 1908. Conceptually, it's quite simple: tuberculin (also called purified protein derivative or PPD) is a standardised dead extract of cultured TB, injected into the skin to measure the person's immune response to the bacteria. So, if a person has been exposed to the bacteria previously, they should express an immune reaction to the injection, usually a mild swelling or redness around the site. There have been two primary methods of TST: the Mantoux test, and the Heaf test. The Heaf test was discontinued in 2005 because the manufacturer deemed its production to be financially unsustainable, though it was previously preferred in the UK because it was felt to require less training to administer and involved less inter-observer variation in its interpretation than the Mantoux test. The Mantoux test was the preferred test in the US, and is now the most widely used TST globally. =Mantoux test= :See: Mantoux test The Mantoux test is now standardised by the WHO. 0.1 ml of tuberculin (100 units/ml), which delivers a dose of 5 units is given by intradermal injection into the surface of the lower forearm (subcutaneous injection results in false negatives). A waterproof ink mark is drawn around the injection site so as to avoid difficulty finding it later if the level of reaction is small. The test is read 48 to 72 hours later. The area of induration (NOT of erythema) is measured transversely across the forearm (left to right, not up and down) and recorded to the nearest millimetre. =Heaf test= :See:Heaf test The Heaf test was first described in 1951. The test uses a Heaf gun with disposable single-use heads; each head has six needles arranged in a circle. There are standard heads and pediatric heads: the standard head is used on all patients aged 2 years and older; the pediatric head is for infants under the age of 2. For the standard head, the needles protrude 2 mm when the gun is actuated; for the pediatric heads, the needles protrude 1 mm. Skin is cleaned with alcohol, then tuberculin (100,000 units/ml) is evenly smeared on the skin (about 0.1 ml); the gun is then applied to the skin and fired. The excess solution is then wiped off and a waterproof ink mark is drawn around the injection site. The test is read 2 to 7 days later. * Grade 0: no reaction, or induration of 3 or less puncture points; * Grade 1: induration of four or more puncture points; * Grade 2: induration of the six puncture points coalesce to form a circle; * Grade 3: induration of 5 mm; or more * Grade 4: induration of 10 mm or more, or ulceration The results of both tests are roughly equivalent as follows: * Heaf grade 0 & 1 ~ Mantoux less than 5 mm; * Heaf grade 2 ~ Mantoux 5‚Äì14 mm; * Heaf grade 3 & 4 ~ Mantoux 15 or greater =Tuberculin conversion= Tuberculin conversion is said to occur if a patient who has previously had a negative tuberculin skin test develops a positive tuberculin skin test at a later test. It indicates a change from negative to positive, and usually signifies a new infection. =Boosting= The phenomenon of boosting is one way of obtaining a false positive test result. Theoretically, a person's ability to develop a reaction to the TST may decrease over time ‚Äì for example, a person is infected with latent TB as a child, and is administered a TST as an adult. Because there has been such a long time since the immune responses to TB has been necessary, that person might give a negative test result. If so, there is a fairly reasonable chance that the TST triggers a hypersensitivity in the person's immune system ‚Äì in other words, the TST reminds the person's immune system about TB, and the body overreacts to what it perceives as a reinfection. In this case, when that subject is given the test again (as is standard procedure, see above) they may have a significantly greater reaction to the test, giving a very strong positive; this can be commonly misdiagnosed as Tuberculin Conversion. This can also be triggered by receiving the BCG vaccine, as opposed to a proper infection. Although boosting can occur in any age group, the likelihood of the reaction increases with age. Boosting is only likely to be relevant if an individual is beginning to undergo periodic TSTs (health care workers, for example). In this case the standard procedure is called two-step testing. The individual is given their first test and in the event of a negative, given a second test in 1 to 3 weeks. This is done to combat boosting in situations where, had that person waited up to a year to get their next TST, they might still have a boosted reaction, and be misdiagnosed as a new infection. Here there is a difference in US and UK guidelines; in the US testers are told to ignore the possibility of false positive due to the BCG vaccine, as the BCG is seen as having waning efficacy over time. Therefore, the CDC urges that individuals be treated based on risk stratification regardless of BCG vaccination history, and if an individual receives a negative and then a positive TST they will be assessed for full TB treatment beginning with X-ray to confirm TB is not active and proceeding from there. Conversely, the UK guidelines acknowledge the potential effect of the BCG vaccination, as it is mandatory and therefore a prevalent concern ‚Äì though the UK shares the procedure of administering two tests, one week apart, and accepting the second one as the accurate result, they also assume that a second positive is indicative of an old infection (and therefore certainly LTBI) or the BCG itself. In the case of BCG vaccinations confusing the results, Interferon-Œ≥ (IFN-Œ≥) tests may be used as they will not be affected by the BCG. =Interpretation= According to the U.S. guidelines, there are multiple size thresholds for declaring a positive result of latent tuberculosis from the Mantoux test: For testees from high-risk groups, such as those who are HIV positive, the cutoff is 5 mm of induration; for medium risk groups, 10 mm; for low-risk groups, 15 mm. The U.S. guidelines recommend that a history of previous BCG vaccination should be ignored. For details of tuberculin skin test interpretation, please refer to the CDC guidelines (reference given below). The UK guidelines are formulated according to the Heaf test: In patients who have had BCG previously, latent TB is diagnosed if the Heaf test is grade 3 or 4 and have no signs or symptoms of active TB; if the Heaf test is grade 0 or 1, then the test is repeated. In patients who have not had BCG previously, latent TB is diagnosed if the Heaf test is grade 2, 3 or 4, and have no signs or symptoms of active TB. Repeat Heaf testing is not done in patients who have had BCG (because of the phenomenon of boosting). For details of tuberculin skin test interpretation, please refer to the BTS guidelines (references given below). Given that the US recommendation is that prior BCG vaccination be ignored in the interpretation of tuberculin skin tests, false positives with the Mantoux test are possible as a result of: (1) having previously had a BCG (even many years ago), and/or (2) periodical testing with tuberculin skin tests. Having regular TSTs boosts the immunological response in those people who have previously had BCG, so these people will falsely appear to be tuberculin conversions. This may lead to treating more people than necessary, with the possible risk of those patients suffering adverse drug reactions. However, as Bacille Calmette-Gu√©rin vaccine is not 100% effective, and is less protective in adults than pediatric patients, not treating these patients could lead to a possible infection. The current US policy seems to reflect a desire to err on the side of safety. The U.S. guidelines also allow for tuberculin skin testing in immunosuppressed patients (those with HIV, or who are on immunosuppressive drugs), whereas the UK guidelines recommend that tuberculin skin tests should not be used for such patients because it is unreliable. Interferon-Œ≥ testing The role of IFN-Œ≥ tests is undergoing constant review and various guidelines have been published with the option for revision as new data becomes available.CDC:MMWR Health Protection Agency:UK There are currently two commercially available interferon-Œ≥ release assays (IGRAs): QuantiFERON-TB Gold and T-SPOT.TB. These tests are not affected by prior BCG vaccination, and look for the body's response to specific TB antigens not present in other forms of mycobacteria and BCG (ESAT-6). Whilst these tests are new they are now becoming available globally.

HPA Interim Guidance: > The HPA recommends the use of IGRA testing in health care workers, if > available, in view of the importance of detecting latently infected staff > who may go on to develop active disease and come into contact with > immunocompromised patients and the logistical simplicity of IGRA testing. Drug-resistant strains It is usually assumed by most medical practitioners in the early stages of a diagnosis that a case of latent tuberculosis is the normal or regular strain of tuberculosis. It will therefore be most commonly treated with Isoniazid (the most used treatment for latent tuberculosis.) Only if the tuberculosis bacteria does not respond to the treatment will the medical practitioner begin to consider more virulent strains, requiring significantly longer and more thorough treatment regimens. There are 4 types of tuberculosis recognized in the world today: * Tuberculosis (TB) * Multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) * Extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR TB) * Totally drug-resistant tuberculosis (TDR TB) Treatment The treatment of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is essential to controlling and eliminating TB by reducing the risk that TB infection will progress to disease. Latent tuberculosis will convert to active tuberculosis in 10% of cases (or more in cases of immune compromised patients). Taking medication for latent tuberculosis is recommended by many doctors. In the U.S., the standard treatment is nine months of isoniazid, but this regimen is not widely used outside of the US. Terminology There is no agreement regarding terminology: the terms preventive therapy and chemoprophylaxis have been used for decades, and are preferred in the UK because it involves giving medication to people who have no disease and are currently well: the reason for giving medication is primarily to prevent people from becoming unwell. In the U.S., physicians talk about latent tuberculosis treatment because the medication does not actually prevent infection: the person is already infected and the medication is intended to prevent existing silent infection from becoming active disease. There are no convincing reasons to prefer one term over the other. Specific situations \\"Populations at increased risk of progressing to active infection once exposed: * Persons with recent TB infection [those infected within the previous two years] * Congenital or acquired immunosuppressed patients (in particular, HIV-positive patients) * Illicit intravenous drug users; alcohol and other chronic substance users * Children (particularly those younger than 4 years old) * Persons with comorbid conditions (ie, chronic kidney failure, diabetes, malignancy, hematologic cancers, body weight of at least 10% less than ideal, silicosis, gastrectomy, jejunoileal bypass, asthma, or other disorders requiring long-term use of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants).\\" Treatment regimens It is essential that assessment to rule out active TB be carried out before treatment for LTBI is started. To give treatment for latent tuberculosis to someone with active tuberculosis is a serious error: the tuberculosis will not be adequately treated and there is a serious risk of developing drug-resistant strains of TB. There are several treatment regimens currently in use: * 9H ‚Äî isoniazid for 9 months is the gold standard (93% effective, in patients with positive test results and fibrotic pulmonary lesions compatible with tuberculosisEfficacy of various durations of isoniazid preventive therapy for tuberculosis: five years of follow-up in the IUAT trial. International Union Against Tuberculosis Committee on Prophylaxis. Bull World Health Organ. 1982;60(4):555-64.). * 6H ‚Äî Isoniazid for 6 months might be adopted by a local TB program based on cost-effectiveness and patient compliance. This is the regimen currently recommended in the UK for routine use. The U.S. guidance excludes this regimen from use in children or persons with radiographic evidence of prior tuberculosis (old fibrotic lesions) (69% effective). * 6 to 9H2 ‚Äî An intermittent twice-weekly regimen for the above 2 treatment regimens is an alternative if administered under Directly observed therapy (DOT). * 4R ‚Äî rifampicin for 4-months is an alternative for those who are unable to take isoniazid or who have had known exposure to isoniazid- resistant TB. * 3HR ‚Äî Isoniazid and rifampin may be given daily for three months. * 2RZ ‚Äî The two-month regimen of rifampin and pyrazinamide is no longer recommended for treatment of LTBI because of the greatly increased risk of drug-induced hepatitis and death. * 3HP ‚Äì three-month (12-dose) regimen of weekly rifapentine and isoniazid.Recommendations for Use of an Isoniazid- Rifapentine Regimen with Direct Observation to Treat Latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis Infection. cdc.gov. updated November 22, 2013. The 3HP regimen has to be administered under DOT. A self-administered therapy (SAT) of 3HP is investigated in a large international study. Evidence for treatment effectiveness A 2000 Cochrane review containing 11 double-blinded, randomized control trials and 73,375 patients examined six and 12 month courses of isoniazid (INH) for treatment of latent tuberculosis. HIV positive and patients currently or previously treated for tuberculosis were excluded. The main result was a relative risk (RR) of 0.40 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.31 to 0.52) for development of active tuberculosis over two years or longer for patients treated with INH, with no significant difference between treatment courses of six or 12 months (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.73 for six months, and 0.38, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.50 for 12 months). A Cochrane systematic review published in 2013 evaluated four different alternatives regimens to INH monotherapy for preventing active TB in HIV-negative people with latent tuberculosis infection. The evidence from this review found no difference between shorter regimens of Rifampicin or weekly, directly observed Rifapentine plus INH compare to INH monotherapy in preventing active TB in HIV-negative people at risk of developing it . However the review found that the shorter Rifampicin regimen for four months and weekly directly observed Rifapentine plus INH for three months ‚Äúmay have additional advantages of higher treatment completion and improved safety.\\" However the overall quality of evidence was low to moderate (as per GRADE criteria )and none of the included trials were conducted in LMIC nations with high TB transmission and hence might not be applicable to nations with high TB transmission. Treatment efficacy There is no guaranteed \\"cure\\" for latent tuberculosis. \\"People infected with TB bacteria have a lifetime risk of falling ill with TB...\\" with those who have compromised immune systems, those with diabetes and those who use tobacco at greater risk. A person who has taken the complete course of Isoniazid (or other full course prescription for tuberculosis) on a regular, timely schedule may have been cured. \\"Current standard therapy is isoniazid (INH) which reduce the risk of active TB by as much as 90 per cent (in patients with positive LTBI test results and fibrotic pulmonary lesions compatible with tuberculosisEfficacy of various durations of isoniazid preventive therapy for tuberculosis: five years of follow-up in the IUAT trial. International Union Against Tuberculosis Committee on Prophylaxis. Bull World Health Organ. 1982;60(4):555-64.) if taken daily for 9 months.\\" [Emphasis added] However, if a person has not completed the medication exactly as prescribed, the \\"cure\\" is less likely, and the \\"cure\\" rate is directly proportional to following the prescribed treatment specifically as recommended. Furthermore, \\"[I]f you don't take the medicine correctly and you become sick with TB a second time, the TB may be harder to treat if it has become drug resistant.\\" If a patient were to be cured in the strictest definition of the word, it would mean that every single bacterium in the system is removed or dead, and that person cannot get tuberculosis (unless re- infected). However, there is no test to assure that every single bacterium has been killed in a patient's system. As such, a person diagnosed with latent TB can safely assume that, even after treatment, they will carry the bacteria ‚Äì likely for the rest of their lives. Furthermore, \\" It has been estimated that up to one-third of the world's population is infected with M. tuberculosis, and this population is an important reservoir for disease reactivation.\\" This means that in areas where TB is endemic treatment may be even less certain to \\"cure\\" TB, as reinfection could trigger activation of latent TB already present even in cases where treatment was followed completely. Epidemiology Tuberculosis exists in all countries in the world. Some countries have a larger number of people infected with tuberculosis than others. For each 100,000 people, Swaziland has the greatest number (627) of tuberculosis cases in the world. Second is Cambodia (560), followed in third position by Zambia (445), fourth is Djibouti (382), fifth is Indonesia (321), sixth is Mali (295), seventh is Zimbabwe (291), eighth is Kenya (291), ninth is Papua New Guinea (283) and tenth is Gambia (283). The United States, Sweden and Iceland have one of the lowest populations of tuberculosis at 2 per 100,000. with Canada, Netherlands, Jamaica, Norway, Malta, Granada and Antigua and Barbuda with 3 per 100,000. In North America, countries over 10:100,000 are Mexico (14), Belize (18), Bahamas (19), Panama (28), El Salvador (36), Nicaragua (35), Honduras (46), Guatemala (48), and the worst is the Dominican Republic (88). Most Western European countries have less than 10 per 100,000 except Spain (14), Portugal (16), Estonia (27), Latvia (43), Lithuania (48), while Eastern and Southern European countries have a greater number with Romania (94) being the highest. In South America, the greatest number of cases of tuberculosis are in Bolivia (30) with Guyana (18) and Honduras (15) following with the remaining countries having less than 10:100,000. \\"One-third of the world‚Äôs burden of tuberculosis (TB), or about 4.9 million prevalent cases, is found in the World Health Organization (WHO) South-East Asia Region.\\" \\"About one-third of the world's population has latent TB, which means people have been infected by TB bacteria but are not (yet) ill with disease and cannot transmit the disease,\\" and most of those cases are in developing countries. \\"In the US, over half of all active TB cases occur in immigrants. The reported cases of active TB in foreign-born persons has remained at 7000‚Äì8000 per year, while the number of cases in US-born people has dropped from 17,000 in 1993 to 6,500 in 2005. As a result, the percentage of active TB cases in immigrants has increased steadily (from 29% of all cases in 1993 to 54% in 2005).\\" and most of those cases are in developing countries. Controversy There is controversy over whether people who test positive long after infection have a significant risk of developing the disease (without re-infection). Some researchers and public health officials have warned that this test-positive population is a \\"source of future TB cases\\" even in the US and other wealthy countries, and that this \\"ticking time bomb\\" should be a focus of attention and resources. On the other hand, Marcel Behr, Paul Edelstein, and Lalita Ramakrishnan reviewed studies concerning the concept of latent tuberculosis in order to determine whether tuberculosis- infected persons have life-long infection capable of causing disease at any future time. These studies, both published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) in 2018 and 2019, show that the incubation period of tuberculosis is short, usually within months after infection, and very rarely more than 2 years after infection. They also show that more than 90% of people infected with M. tuberculosis for more than two years never develop tuberculosis even if their immune system is severely suppressed. Immunologic tests for tuberculosis infection such as the tuberculin skin test and interferon gamma release assays (IGRA) only indicate past infection, with the majority of previously infected persons no longer capable of developing tuberculosis. Ramakrishnan told the New York Times that researchers \\"have spent hundreds of millions of dollars chasing after latency, but the whole idea that a quarter of the world is infected with TB is based on a fundamental misunderstanding.\\" The first BMJ article about latency was accompanied by an editorial written by Dr. Soumya Swaminathan, Deputy Director-General of the World Health Organization, who endorsed the findings and called for more funding of TB research directed at the most heavily afflicted parts of the world, rather than disproportionate attention to a relatively minor problem that affects just the wealthy countries.

The crossing is northwest of the intersection of Western Avenue and Archer Avenue, in the Brighton Park neighborhood of Chicago, Illinois. The railroads involved in the crossing are CSX, Canadian National and Norfolk Southern. The crossing consisted of the CN's two-track line in a roughly east‚Äìwest orientation, crossing the five north‚Äìsouth tracks operated by NS and CSX. Collectively, these railroads operate approximately 80 trains per day through the crossing. The CN line was formerly the main line of the Gulf Mobile & Ohio and its predecessor Alton Railroad and currently carries Metra Heritage Corridor commuter trains and Amtrak passenger trains to St. Louis. The GM&O;'s Brighton Park passenger stop was at this location. The junction may be easily viewed from the CTA Orange Line trains that pass on an elevated structure immediately southeast of the crossing. Brighton Park station, located near the crossing on what is now the Metra Heritage Corridor, was closed in 1984. Until July 6, 2007, the crossing was controlled by a human switchtender in a cabin near the crossing using semaphore signals to govern train movements through the diamonds. Because the crossing was not interlocked, all trains were required to make a stop before proceeding over the crossing as signaled by the specific semaphore signal governing the track the train was on. As a major crossing, and one of the few remaining locations with this classic method of operation, Brighton Park was a major attraction for rail enthusiasts, but had become increasingly inefficient for Chicago area rail operations. As part of the Chicago Region Environmental and Transportation Efficiency Program (CREATE) project, the Brighton Park crossing, the semaphore signals, and switchtender's cabin were taken out of service on the evening of Friday, July 6, 2007 and conversion to an interlocked crossing ensued over the following weekend. As part of the conversion project, some of the tracks at the crossing were realigned and new crossing diamonds were put in place.  History  The bracket post that carried five semaphores governing train movements in three different directions at Brighton Park. The Willis Tower can be seen amidst the haze in the background. By the early 20th century, the Brighton Park crossing comprised tracks belonging to the Baltimore and Ohio Chicago Terminal Railroad; the Chicago Junction Railroad, eventually controlled by the New York Central Railroad as the Chicago River and Indiana; and the Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad, commonly known as the \\"Panhandle Route\\", which was controlled by the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) running north to south and crossing the Chicago and Alton main line running east to west. The PCC&StL; was the first railroad to cross the C&A; at Brighton Park in the 1860s and therefore was responsible for arranging the safe crossing of trains. As other railroads built along the Panhandle right of way, this arrangement remained in effect with the responsibility passing to the PRR. For the PRR the Panhandle Route connecting Pittsburgh and Cincinnati via Indianapolis was of secondary importance to its Main Line via Fort Wayne, Indiana, with the latter having direct access to Chicago Union Station from the south, while the Panhandle route ran west of the city to loop around and access the station from the north. The Baltimore and Ohio was somewhat late arriving into the Chicago market and had to use trackage rights and the Panhandle right of way to eventually reach Grand Central Station via a similar out and back loop route and arrived south of downtown via the St. Charles Air Line Bridge. The Chicago Junction Railroad was a switching and terminal railroad that served the stockyard area and was eventually purchased by the New York Central. At its peak the crossing involved a total of 8 tracks of the PRR, B&OCT; and CR&I; crossing the two tracks of the C&A.; Also included in the complex were a number of hand-operated crossovers and wye tracks. Each of the 4 railroads involved in the crossing employed switchtenders on site to manage any crossover or connecting movements, with the PRR maintaining two tender stations, north and south of the crossing, to protect the two B&OCT; to C&A; wye tracks where they each crossed the Panhandle main line and the C&A; crossing itself. Switchtender cabin \\"A\\" managed the Alton crossing and would continue to do so until the crossing was interlocked in 2007. For both the B&OCT; and PCC&StL;, Brighton Park was one in a string of non-interlocked railroad crossings at grade with others at Ash Street, 26th St and 12th St. Maximum speed on the route was between 20-30 mph. Interlocking the Brighton Park crossing would have been of limited value without upgrading the entire line. As passenger traffic on the route dried up and the railroads entered financial hardship, investment in the line became less and less of a priority. With the formation of the Penn Central and later Conrail, the PCC&StL; and CR&I; lines through Brighton Park were united under a single railroad. The Panhandle route was ultimately abandoned with Conrail shifting traffic to the C&RI;, ripping up the two Panhandle tracks, thus reducing the number of tracks crossing the Alton to 5. Under Conrail the CR&I; was designated as an industrial track, its lowest classification. Since the PRR era crossing agreement with the Alton successor Illinois Central Railroad was still in effect, Conrail had little incentive to upgrade the signaling on the line.  Modernization  Model board showing the layout of the new Brighton Park interlocking. The modernization effort to automate the Brighton Park crossing was undertaken as part of the Chicago Region Environmental and Transportation Efficiency Program (CREATE) in 2007. It involved Safetran Systems, (part of Invensys Rail) with the crossing's application development, site mock-up, and preliminary factory testing taking place in Rancho Cucamonga, California in an in-house project called \\"Brighton Park / Pershing Main.\\" In addition to the full automation of the crossing, additional interlocked crossovers would be installed north and south, eliminating a number of hand-operated switches. This was all done in conjunction with a centralized traffic control project on both the ex-Conrail and B&OCT; lines, upgrading them from dark territory and automatic block signaling respectively. Ultimately control of the new remote crossing would pass to the Norfolk Southern railroad, who had previously employed the switchtender. Future As a part of the CREATE project, a flyover on the CN/Heritage Corridor over the Western Avenue Corridor tracks would be constructed. The flyover project would reduce congestion to the 76 freight and passenger trains that go through the diamond crossing every day. The project is currently unfunded.

The members were A.R. Richardson, W. Paterson (the first manager of the Agricultural Bank), J.H.D. Amherst, F.H. Piesse and G.L. Throssell. Initially, the bureau was not placed under the supervision of a minister. This changed in April 1898 when the bureau became the Agricultural Advisory Board and a new Department of Agriculture was gazetted under the control of Throssell as Commissioner for Crown Lands. Professor William Lowrie was appointed director in 1908. He resigned in 1911. Sir James Mitchell was at this time Minister for Agriculture and he expanded the senior position to three commissioners: George Lowe Sutton, as Commissioner for the Wheat Belt, James M.B.

She possessed a large, rich-toned voice and was an intense singing-actress, especially in dramatic roles such as Ortrud (Lohengrin) and Amneris (Aida), two of her greatest roles. \\"Rita Gorr\\", Obituary, The Telegraph (London), 1 March 2012 on telegraph.co.uk Life and career Gorr was born Marguerite Geirnaert into a working-class family in the industrial town of Zelzate, near Ghent, Belgium.Loppert M. Rita Gorr, 1926-2012. Opera, March 2012, 287-290. After leaving school she worked as a nurse, where the family who employed her discovered her singing and paid for her first lessons. After vocal studies in Ghent with Vina Bovy, and in Brussels with Jeanne Pacquot d'Assy and Germaine Hoerner, she won first prize at the vocal competition of Verviers in 1946, and made her professional debut at Antwerp as Fricka in Die Walk√ºre the same year. She became a member of the Opera of Strasbourg from 1949 to 1952. She won another first prize at the vocal competition of Lausanne in 1952. That year she made her Paris debuts at the Op√©ra-Comique as Charlotte in Werther on 6 March 1952, and at the Paris Op√©ra on 31 October as Magdalena in Die Meistersinger von N√ºrnberg; further roles in Paris included Dalila in Samson and Delilah, Venus in Tannh√§user, M√®re Marie in the French premiere of Dialogues of the Carmelites (later in her career she sang Madame de Croissy), Carmen, Genevi√®ve in Pell√©as et M√©lisande, Amneris in Aida, Eboli in Don Carlos and Marguerite in La damnation de Faust. Her career then became international in scope, with debuts at Bayreuth in 1958, the Royal Opera House in 1959, La Scala in 1960, the Metropolitan Opera on October 17, 1962 as Amneris. In four seasons at the Met, she sang Santuzza in Cavalleria rusticana, Eboli in Don Carlos, Azucena in Il trovatore, and Dalila. She was a versatile artist, singing with equal success the French, Italian and German repertories. She enjoyed a very long career singing well into her 60s and 70s and her last role was as the Countess in Tchaikovsky's The Queen of Spades which she performed in the summer of 2007 in Ghent and Antwerp. Gorr believed that 'trouser-roles' did not suit her; she did however sing Lel in The Snow Maiden in 1955 in concert and Octavian in 1958. Although mainly active on stage, Gorr also sang occasionally in the concert hall, in works by Schumann, Duparc and Wagner; she recorded Mahler lieder.Oresko R. Still going strong - Robert Oresko celebrates the octogenarian Rita Gorr. Opera, May 2007, 530-4. Gorr can be heard in two of her greatest roles on recordings: Ortrud in Lohengrin in the 1965 studio performance under Erich Leinsdorf, opposite S√°ndor K√≥nya and Lucine Amara, as well as in the 1959 live performance from the Bayreuth Festival conducted by Lovro von Mataƒçiƒá; and Amneris in Aida in the 1961 studio performance under Georg Solti, opposite Leontyne Price and Jon Vickers. Other recorded roles include Dalila in Samson and Delilah under Georges Pr√™tre in 1962 (studio), Margared in Le Roi d'Ys under Andr√© Cluytens in 1957 (studio), M√®re Marie in Dialogues des Carm√©lites under Pierre Dervaux in 1958 (studio), Fricka in Die Walk√ºre under Erich Leinsdorf in 1961 (studio), as well as both roles of Fricka in Das Rheingold and Die Walk√ºre, Grimgerde in Die Walk√ºre and the Third Norn in G√∂tterd√§mmerung ‚Äî all four in live performances at the Bayreuth Festival in 1958 under Hans Knappertsbusch. She also recorded excerpts from Orph√©e et Eurydice (Orph√©e), H√©rodiade (title role) and La damnation de Faust, as well as recitals on Path√©. Gorr can be heard in one of her rarest roles, in an excerpt from Cherubini's Medea (recorded in French) with the Orchestre du Theatre National de l'Opera under George Pretre on ASTX 130502 Pathe-Marconi, and in excerpts from two of her other Wagner roles ‚Äî Isolde and Elisabeth ‚Äî under Andr√© Cluytens on Testament SBT1256. In her later life Gorr made her home in D√©nia, Spain. Oresko describes her as giving \\"the impression of regal grandeur and control by the solidness of her vocal production and a unique gift for instinctive authority\\".

It was released by Interceptor Micros for the Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC and ZX Spectrum. Music was written by Chris Cox.http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=1191 The Spectrum and Amstrad versions were adapted by David M. Banner with graphics by Terry Greer. A sequel, The Empire of Karn, was released in 1985 on the Commodore 64. Gameplay The player must rescue four heroes who have been magically imprisoned, and thus save the land of Karn from dominion by evil creatures. The heroes are Beren the swordsman, Istar the wizard, Haldir the Elf-lord, and Khadim the dwarf. The game's parser accepts relatively complex sentences for the time (e.g. \\"attack giant clam with shovel\\"). The puzzles are mostly straightforward, involving the use of an object found elsewhere to defeat the creature that is impeding progress. The creatures and NPCs in the game, including the heroes themselves, are rather inert and are very limited in their interactions. The game has 65 locations. The game is mostly text, with illustrations for some of the locations. Reception The Commodore 64 version of the game received criticism for slow loading of graphical scenes, which could take as long as several minutes to display completely. The Spectrum and Amstrad CPC versions were by a different artist (Terry Greer) and quicker to draw.

It was the third US Navy squadron to be designated as VF-74. History VBF-20 was established on 16 April 1945 flying the F4U-1 Corsair from NAS Wildwood in New Jersey. After six months they transitioned to the F6F Hellcat but soon changed to F8F Bearcat. On 15 November 1946 their designation was changed to VF-10A and was part of Carrier Air Group 9 on board and made their first deployment to the Mediterranean between February and June 1948. Before the cruise VF-10A had shifted to their new shore base of Naval Auxiliary Air Station Charlestown, Rhode Island. At the same time, the squadron had adopted their devil's insignia created by Ensign John P. Humphries. On 12 August 1948 the squadron became VF-92 and became part of CAG-7, moving to Naval Air Station Quonset Point and their final re-designation happened on 15 January 1950 when they became VF-74. They transitioned to the F4U-4 Corsair in 1951 and returned to the Mediterranean on board the . F4U-4s of VF-74 on USS Midway, 1945. With the Korean war raging, CAG-7 transferred to the Pacific in May 1952 and conducted a combat cruise on board . They were in combat for six months and flew 1500 combat sorties, mainly against North Korean targets. They also moved to the F9F-8 Cougar, their first jet aircraft. An F4D-1 Skyray of VF-74 on USS Franklin D. Roosevelt Within 12 months the F9F-8 Cougar was replaced by the F4D-1 Skyray which was the US Navy's first supersonic fighter, although it was phased out in 1962. VF-74 deployed to the Mediterranean three times, twice on board and their final deployment was on USS Franklin D. Roosevelt. On 8 July 1961 VF-74 began to transition to the F-4B Phantom II becoming the first deployable F-4 squadron, giving rise to their \\"First in Phantoms\\" motto. They deployed aboard in August 1962 replacing VF-104's F4Ds in CAG-8{fact}. For 20 years VF-74 would deploy 15 times with the Phantom, 13 to the Mediterranean and two to South East Asia. Their first Vietnam cruise aboard Forrestal was marked by tragedy on 29 July 1967, when an ordnance explosion on the flight deck caused a massive ensuing fire. VF-74 lost 42 enlisted personnel and three F-4s. Many squadron members were commended for their heroic actions whilst fighting the fires. In early 1972 they transitioned from the F-4B to the F-4J. Between July 1972 to February 1973 the squadron returned to combat in Vietnam on board . During seven periods on the famous Yankee Station VF-74 did not lose a single aircraft to enemy action. VF-74 was just as successful in peace time, winning the CNO Safety \\"S\\" in 1974 along with the Battle \\"E\\". In 1975, they moved to CVW-8 and took part in the maiden cruise of .

In February 1983 they began the transition to the F-14 Tomcat and in October the same year the squadron reported back to CVW-17 and their first cruise was in April 1984 on board which ended in October the same year. A F-4J of VF-74 during the deployment to Vietnam In 1985 VF-74 and VF-103 became famous in the fight against terrorism. On 7 October, members of the Palestine Liberation Front (PLF) hijacked the Italian cruise liner . When the ship arrived in Syria the hijackers made their way to Egypt where they were promised free passage to Tunisia in return for the hostages' lives. The terrorists boarded an Egypt Air Boeing 737 on the night of 10 October. But based on US Intelligence, president Ronald Reagan ordered the Sixth Fleet to take action, to force down the 737 to Sigonella where US Special Forces could capture the hijackers. Four F-14s and an E-2C Hawkeye launched from Saratoga. The plan called for Saratogas planes to make night intercepts and identifications of air contacts on the airways crisscrossing the central Mediterranean as they flew eastward toward a common airway intersection south of Crete. After four interceptions, following two hair-raising, lights out intercepts of planes, the F-14s found the right aircraft. At about 2230, southeast of Crete they closed in on the 737 which showed the tail number 2843 which identified the aircraft as the one they were looking for. After identifying themselves to the airliner's pilot, the American planes eventually were able to convince the 737 to land at the NATO base in Sigonella, Sicily. Upon landing, the airliner was quickly surrounded by American and Italian soldiers. After one thrilling hour in which Americans and Italians were facing each other, after a long call between the Italian First Minister Bettino Craxi and US President Ronald Reagan, the terrorists ultimately were taken into Italian custody. 1986 was another busy year for VF-74 as they took part in Operation Attain Document and Operation El Dorado Canyon. During the next few years, VF-74 would make regular deployments to the Mediterranean Sea as part of CVW-17. An F-14B Tomcat from VF-74 stationed aboard USS Saratoga On 11 August 1988 VF-74 became the first squadron to receive the F-14A+ (now F-14B). By the end of the year they had finished the transition and VF-74 became the first squadron to launch an AIM-54 Phoenix from an F-14A+. In 1990, VF-74 took part in Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm. VF-74 relieved , they took up station in the Red Sea and worked with Saratoga'. After eight months they returned to NAS Oceana on 29 March 1991. Within a year, VF-74 was back on cruise with Saratoga on 6 May 1992. Operations included taking part in support of the United Nations aid to the former republics of Yugoslavia in July. On 14 September, VF-74 F-14s flew from Saratoga operating in the Adriatic Sea, dropping ordnance on the Wadi Natrun target range in Egypt. The squadron returned home on 6 November. As usual after returning from cruise, the squadron went straight to workups for the next deployment on board after the carrier had returned from Service Life Extension Program, they also conducted carrier qualifications on USS Saratoga. However, in August 1993 the Navy decided to deploy only one F-14 squadron on board Saratoga, and as VF-74 was a non-TARPS squadron they were left back home and moved from CVW-17 to be under direct command of Fighter Wing Atlantic. Although they did not take part in any cruise VF-74 took up aggressor role with various Navy and Air Force squadrons. On 20 January 1994, VF-74 took part in the last deployment, this time to Roosevelt Roads Naval Station in February where VF-74 launched seven air-to-air missiles with 100% success rate. On 30 April 1994, VF-74 was disestablished after 50 years of service.

The club is one of the oldest in Russia. Originally a club for those who worked on the railways, they participated in the first USSR rugby union championship in 1937. Lokomotiv were Soviet Championship winners in 1983. During the existence of the USSR, RC Lokomotiv Moscow club was a part of the Lokomotiv Voluntary Sports Society. In 1991, following York City Knights and Fulham‚Äôs tour to the country, the club switched from rugby union to rugby league, owing mostly to rugby union's amateur status at the time, and the desire by players to be paid. Lokomotiv have gone on to dominate Russian rugby league. They have won seven Championships, including league and cup doubles in 2002-2005. Twelve players from the club were in the Russian national team in 2005. Lokomotiv had their best season ever in 2005, winning the league and cup double in Russia, winning 21 out of 22 matches and scoring 1,560 points in the process. However, they have not yet transferred this success over to the Rugby League Challenge Cup. In their three previous games in this competition, they have failed to register a win. In 2009 the club announced its intention to play rugby union in addition to rugby league from the 2010 season onwards, fielding their junior side in rugby league still and thereby partially reversing the club's 1991 switch from rugby union to rugby league. The decision to return to rugby union was primarily due to the desire of the Lokomotiv club to compete in the Russian rugby union sevens championship following the IOC's October 2009 decision to readmit rugby union as an Olympic sport in its seven-a-side format and the unwillingness of the Rugby Union of Russia to admit the Lokomotiv club to play in its rugby union sevens competition without also committing to the full 15-a-side version of rugby union.  2009 Squad International players * Andrey Dumalkin * Igor Gavrilin * Igor Jiltsov * Alexandr Lysenkov * Viktor Nechaev * Vadim Postnikov * Petr Sokolov * Roman Ouchinnikov * Denis Meshkov * Vadim Fedchuk * Viktor Nechaev * Sergey Dobrinin * Vladimir Odnosumov Honours *Russian Championship: 9 :: 1983‚Ä†, 1993, 2000, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007 *Russian Cup: 12 :: 1978‚Ä†, 1986‚Ä†, 1995, 2000, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 ‚Ä†Rugby union honours See also *FC Lokomotiv Moscow Notes External links *Official website *Official message board *Unofficial website *Unofficial message board *RC Lokomotiv on youtube Lokomotiv Moscow Lokomotiv Moscow Lokomotiv Moscow Category:Rugby clubs established in 1937 ","title":"RC Lokomotiv Moscow"},{"id":"4272072","text":"Angleterre Hotel () is a modern, luxury business-class hotel on Voznesensky Prospekt at Saint Isaac's Square in Saint Petersburg, Russia. The hotel opened in 1991, replicating a historic hotel originally opened in 1840 and reconstructed in 1889. The hotel has 192 rooms, including five suites. History The first hotel on the site was established by Napoleon Bokin in 1840, a three-story structure known as Napoleon's. Leo Tolstoy was a frequent guest. The hotel was completely rebuilt from 1886‚Äì89, with a fourth floor added and the interiors reconstructed. At this time, the name was changed to Hotel Angleterre, meaning 'Hotel England' in French. The hotel had 75 rooms and numerous shops on the ground floor. The Angleterre and Astoria in 1930 The neighboring Hotel Astoria, opened in 1912, soon proved such a success that the Angleterre was set for demolition for a huge expansion of the Astoria designed by architect Fyodor Lidval, mirroring the existing Astoria building. However the outbreak of World War I prevented this. The Angleterre's name was changed after the Russian Revolution to Hotel International (1919‚Äì25) and then to Hotel Leningradskaya from 1948 to the early 1970s. It is famous in Russia as the place where poet Sergei Yesenin hanged himself on 28 December 1925. The Angleterre and Astoria in 2008 In 1985 the hotel closed, and in 1987, during Perestroika, the city authorities decided to demolish the aging hotel and replace it with a modern building with a facade copying the original. Members of the public gathered on St. Isaac's Square to protest the plan. It was the first major public protest in the history of the Soviet Union to be left unpunished by the authorities. The hotel was ultimately demolished on 18 March 1987. Just after demolition explosion on March 18 1987 The current hotel opened in 1991. The Angleterre seen from St. Isaac's Cathedral Today, the hotel is owned and managed by the Rocco Forte Hotels, which also owns and manages the adjacent Hotel Astoria. The Angleterre is marketed as the business-class wing of its more luxurious sister. The upper guest room floors of the two hotels are connected.

Personal life Desjardins was married to Julie Christensen. The pair divorced in 1988. Following the divorce, Desjardins sought help for drug and alcohol problems in a 12-step program. Music The Flesh Eaters were a staple of the LA Punk Scene in the 1980s. The band played alongside seminal bands like The Misfits and The Meat Puppets. A number of original Flesh Eaters releases, like \\"River of Fever\\", were recorded through Shakeytown Music/BMI. Others were produced by Upsetter, Invasion/Bomp, Zippo/Demon or SST. When not working with The Flesh Eaters during that time, Desjardins was the co-leader, with then-spouse Julie Christensen, of the Divine Horsemen between 1984 and 1988. In early 2006 Desjardins performed several times in California, and once in London, with John Doe, DJ Bonebrake, Dave Alvin, Bill Bateman, and Steve Berlin as The Flesh Eaters. This line-up of the band had not performed together since 1981. Desjardins issued a solo semi-acoustic LP on America's Enigma Records and the French New Rose label, called \\"Time Stands Still\\" by Chris D./Divine Horseman in 1984. The album was later released in Australia by Dog Meat Records of Melbourne. It features guest musicians John Doe, Jeffrey Lee Pierce, Linda \\"Tex\\" Jones and Dave Alvin. Desjardins issued a second solo album entitled \\"I Pass for Human\\" as Stone By Stone following the end of his marriage to Julie Christensen. He released a further solo album \\"Love Cannot Die\\" through the Sympathy for the Record Industry label in 1995. From 1989 to 1993 and from 1997 to 2000, Desjardins performed live with varying line-ups of The Flesh Eaters. Two albums, \\"Ashes of Time\\" (1999) and \\"Miss Muerte\\" (2004), were released during the latter period. Chris D. worked as an A&R; and in- house producer for Slash and Ruby Records from 1980 until early 1984. He produced all the Flesh Eaters' albums and co-produced The Gun Club's debut album, Fire of Love, with Tito Larriva in 1982. Desjardins produced the debut albums of The Dream Syndicate (The Days of Wine and Roses), Green On Red (Gravity Talks) and The Lazy Cowgirls.

In Wales, Best Value is known as the Wales Programme for Improvement.  Introduction  The predecessor to the UK Labour Government's Best Value policy was the Conservative Government's 1980s policy of Compulsory Competitive Tendering (CCT). This required public-sector organisations to enable private companies to bid for contracts to deliver public services (such as cleaning, transport, security, and catering) in competition with the public sector's own organisations. The idea was to improve services through competition. CCT requirements were relaxed upon the election of the Labour government in 1997, but similar concepts were soon promoted by the Labour government through its 'Best Value' policy. Edmund Heery and Mike Noon, 'Compulsory Competitive Tendering', in A Dictionary of Human Resource Management, 2nd rev. edn (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2008), , . Best Value was introduced in England and Wales by the Local Government Act 1999, introduced by the UK Labour Government. Its provisions came into force in April 2000. The aim was to improve local services in terms of both cost and quality: A Best Value authority must make arrangements to secure continuous improvement in the way in which its functions are exercised, having regard to a combination of economy, efficiency and effectiveness (LGA 1999, section 3[1]).  Effects  The range of activities affected includes almost all local authority functions, including for example social services, environmental health, housing and planning. The first details of Best Value were set out in the ‚ÄôTwelve Principles of Best Value‚Äô announced in June 1997 (DoE 1997). The bill to provide the statutory framework was introduced in the 1998/9 parliamentary session. In the period between announcement and introduction (May 1997 and April 2000) the Government sponsored 37 voluntary council ‚Äòpilots‚Äô, 22 of which contained a housing element. The purpose of the pilots was to ‚Äútest elements of the best value framework, and assess the extent to which actual improvements in service quality and efficiency have flowed from the new approach‚Äù (DETR 1997a). The rationale for the introduction of Best Value was summarised as follows: Under Compulsory Competitive Tendering service quality has often been neglected and efficiency gains have been uneven and uncertain, and it has proved inflexible in practice. There have been significant costs for employees, often leading to high staff turnover and the demoralisation of those expected to provide quality services. Compulsion has also bred antagonism, so that neither local authorities nor private sector suppliers have been able to realise the benefits that flow from a healthy partnership. All too often the process of competition has become an end in itself, distracting attention from the services that are actually provided to local people. CCT will therefore be abolished (DETR 1998, s.1.5). Thus, the rationale for Best Value emphasised three points: the failure of Compulsory Competitive Tendering; the importance of partnership in service provision; and the adverse effect of competition as a prime objective.  History  Under the leadership of John Major the Conservative government pursued Compulsory Competitive Tendering almost as a dogma, often against the wishes of local government. This led to an uncomfortable stand-off between the two, with CCT regulations being produced in increasing detail, and sometimes extending further than would have been the case in the private sector. The government was unambiguous about what was required ‚Äì issue of tender, receipt of tender, selection of provider. The term compulsory competitive tendering was superseded in 2000 by best value.SocietyGuardian, The Guardian Labour's Best Value proved more difficult to define. The notion of Best Value prior to implementation was enshrined within one key consultation document: Modernising Local Government ‚Äî Improving local services through best value (DETR 1998a). This set out four defining elements of Best Value. The first was the duty to secure economic, efficient and effective services continuously (the ‚Äò3 Es‚Äô). The second required service reviews within which the authority must demonstrate that in the fulfilment of their duties under Best Value they have: compared their service provision with that of other private and public providers; consulted with local business and community; considered competition in provision; and challenged the reasons for, and methods of, provision (the ‚Äò4 Cs‚Äô). The third defining element introduced a regime of audit and measurement of performance, with the broad expectation that, year-on-year, costs would reduce and quality would increase. Performance would be monitored locally through Best Value Performance Reviews (BVPRs), partly through adherence to locally and statutorily determined Best Value performance indicators (BVPIs), and disseminated annually through Performance Plans (BVPPs). The fourth defining element of Best Value outlined the consequence of performance: Government intervention in cases of Best Value failure, and reward in cases of success. In turn these four aspects of Best Value are bound by adherence to twelve principles of Best Value mentioned above. The answer to the question of what method of service delivery, precisely, the Government expected to arise from Best Value seemed to centre on local interpretation as satisfactory. The lack of clear definition, in the context of housing services, was explained as follows: The paper does not attempt to define what best value in housing is ‚Äî that is primarily a matter for individual local authorities in consultation with local people. The primary intention is to explain the process framework within which local housing authorities will need to operate in obtaining best value in housing (DETR 1999, s.1.3). Therefore, while the message was unequivocally that Compulsory Competitive Tendering was to be withdrawn, the replacement was to be less prescribed, with the intention that local authorities follow a responsive and locally determined method of service provision within a centrally defined framework. Best Value was not, therefore, about what local authorities should do: it was a framework that prescribed how they should decide what to do. Specifically Best Value would differ from Compulsory Competitive Tendering in three respects: organisation performance, organisation process, and the relationship between process and performance (Boyne 1999, p. 2).  Measuring Best Value  For Councils and Authorities to be measured against Best Value, Performance Indicators, known as BVPIs (Best Value Performance Indicators) were introduced. They are a statutory set of 90 indicators developed by Government Departments to measure the performance of local authorities, that is, all local authorities must measure themselves against BVPIs. The data is collected and audited annually by the Audit Commission. There Were 90 BVPIs, which cover many, but not all aspects of services provided by local councils. These were withdrawn in 2008. In order to get a balanced view of performance the BVPIs cover four dimensions of performance: *Strategic Objectives ‚Äî why the service exists and what it seeks to achieve *Service Delivery Outcomes ‚Äì how well the service is being operated in order to achieve the strategic objectives *Quality ‚Äì the quality of the services delivered, explicitly reflecting users' experience of services, and *Fair access ‚Äì ease and equality of access to services Each year Government Departments work with each other to set indicators for the next year. BVPIs are set in line with the financial year (1 April to 31 March). Many of the BVPIs have been in effect since the start of Best Value in April 2000, but some new indicators have been set, and some existing indicators were revised either to improve their definition or to be aligned with Central Government policy. Where a BVPI has a target attached to it, these targets are reviewed each year, in light of the most recent performance data provide by a local council. As far as possible the Government has tried to limit the number of changes. In fact, there were no amendments of additions to the BVPI set last year, and Government has agreed to make no amendments to the present BVPIs until 2008/09.  Consequences of failing Best Value  Where a council fails to meet a statutory target, the Secretary of State is at liberty to take action, particularly where an authority is not meeting its duty of continuous improvement. In practice, the Secretary of State can direct the Council to take specific action to secure improvement, or, in extreme cases, remove the function(s) concerned from its control altogether..

The objective is to keep a series of pipes unblocked so that water may flow through them. It was followed by Super Pipeline II by the same author in 1985. Gameplay Enemies include saboteurs that plug up the pipes, bugs that fall from the ceiling to kill the player, and a monster that patrols the pipe in later levels. The player is armed with a gun that can kill bugs, saboteurs, as well as the monster (but only from behind), and is followed by a helper that can remove plugs and kill the smaller bugs.

Early career He played with Hobart in the Tasmanian Football League from 1986‚Äì1990 and was in Hobart's 1990 TFL Premiership side, then also spent some time with Fitzroy pre-season in 1986 and had played with the Fitzroy reserves (at least one game at North Hobart) and became a police officer in Tasmania, when he was granted extended leave to play AFL. St Kilda Picked up as a late pick in the 1990 AFL Draft (pick 92), Shanahan spent two seasons with St Kilda's reserves before debuting in 1992 with the St Kilda Football Club. Shanahan played in St Kilda‚Äôs 1996 AFL Ansett Australia Cup winning side ‚Äì the club's first AFL Cup win. He was a tall, solid defender and was valuable to the club.

His peak came in 1997 with the Saints when he performed brilliantly at full-back, but during the 1997 AFL Grand Final he suffered from a goal onslaught by Adelaide matchwinners Darren Jarman and Shane Ellen. Many St Kilda supporters still cringe at then-coach Stan Alves' refusal to move Shanahan off Jarman, who kicked five last quarter goals to win the Grand Final for Adelaide. Melbourne After the 1997 season had finished, Shanahan moved to the Melbourne Football Club due to the Saints not granting the then 30-year-old's request for a long-term contract. He played out his career at the Demons and played his last game at the end of 1999. He played at full back and did not score any goals in his career, only five behinds, one in 1996 and four in 1997.

In ancient times it was an extensive town, and present villages such as Dattani, Kiverli, Kharadi and Santpura were its suburbs. The old ruins, such as temples, torans and images scattered over the large area, bear testimony to its past glory.  History  Pillars of ruined Jain temple of 13th century at Chandravati, sketched in 1866 Archeological excavations suggested that there was a large settlement at the place before the establishment of Chandravati by Paramaras. Chandravati was ruled by the Paramaras of Abu. The first Paramara ruler of the area was Sindhuraja in the early tenth century.Mathur, Vijayendra Kumar: Aitihasik Sthanavali (Hindi), Vaigyanik tatha Takaniki Shabdawali Ayog, Government of India, 1990, p.319 Chandravati was the major city in past said to once been eighteen miles in circuit. Its prosperity seems to have lasted from the seventh to the beginning of the fifteenth century. Tradition gives it an earlier origin than Dhar, making it the metropolis of Western India, when the Parmara was paramount lord to whom the nine castles of the desert were the grand subordinate fiefs. In the seventh century, then subordinate to Dhar, it proved a place of refuge to Raja Bhoj, when, by some northern invader, he was forced to flee from his capital. From the Parmars it was wrested by the Chauhan chieftains of Sirohi, and, on the establishment of the Chaulukya dynasty of Anhilwad Patan (942) the rulers of Chandravati became its vassals. The remains at Chandravati and on mount Abu seem to point to the eleventh and twelfth centuries as the time of greatest wealth and splendour. The materials recovered by excavation suggested that it was established around 7th century and expanded into a large settlement (about 50 hectare) around 10th or 11th century when it was a capital township. In 1024 AD, Chandravati was attacked and plundered by Mahmud Ghazni when he passed through Rajasthan to attack Anhilwad Patan. After defeating Prithviraj III in 1192 AD, the Muslim army also attacked Chandravati. In 1197, its rulers Prahladan and Dharavarsh, as feudatories to Bhimdev II (1178 - 1243) of Anhilwad, encamping near Abu, attempted to hold the entrance into Gujarat against Kutb-ud-din Aibak (1192 -1210). Notwithstanding their strong position they were attacked, defeated, and put to flight. Great wealth fell into the victor'shands, and, as he passed on and took Anhilvada, it is probable that, on his way, he plundered Chandravati. Kutb-ud-din's expedition was little more than a passing raid, and Dharavarsh's son succeeded him. He, or his successor, was about 1270 defeated and driven out by the Chauhans of Nadol. In about 1315 AD Chandravati passed into the hands of Deora Chauhans. Then (1304) came Alauddin Khalji's final conquest of Gujarat, and Chandravati, with Anhilwad as the centre of Muslim power, lost almost all independence. Another hundred years completed its ruin. In the beginning of the fifteenth century, by the founding of Sirohi (1405), Chandravati ceased to be the seat of a Hindu chief, and, a few years later (1411 - 1412), its buildings and skilled craftsmen were carried off to enrich the new capital of Sultan Ahmed Shah I (1411 - 1443) of Gujarat Sultanate. Since then Chandravati has remained forsaken and desolate. Even its ruins, sold and carried off as building materials, have all but disappeared. Though some are more modern, most of the Chandravati remains belong to the eleventh and twelfth centuries, the best period of Abu architecture (1032-1247). Sahasamala Devada shifted his capital to Sirohi around 1450 AD, and from then on Chandravati lost its glory. In 1824 Sir Charles Colville and his party, the first European visitors to Chandravati, found twenty marble edifices of different sizes. One Brahmanic temple was adorned with rich, very well executed sculptured figures and ornaments in high relief, many of the figures almost quite detached. The chief images were of Brahma, two Shiva, Mahishasuramardini, Yama. The best executed were the dancing nymphs, with garlands and musical instruments, many of them extremely graceful. Except the roof of the domes, whoso outer marble cover was gone, the temple was white marble throughout, the lustre of tho prominent part undimmed. Near the temple, two richly carved columns, supporting an entablature and sculptured pediment, are probably triumphal pillars, kirti stambh, like those at Sidhpur. When visited by British explorer Burgess in 1874, of the twenty buildings not more than three or four were left. The remains of Chandravati was destroyed further during the construction of the railway track between Malwa and Abu road before independence. It is now a small village.  Arts and literature  There were a large number of temples in Chandravati. They were mainly Shiva temples and Jain temples. Many European scholars who visited this area in the nineteenth century have written about surviving artistic specimens. James Tod has given pictures of some of these temples in his Travels in Western India. In 1824 Charles Colville and his party visited Chandravati and found twenty marble edifices of different sizes. One temple to Brahma was adorned with rich and finely executed sculptured figures and ornaments in high relief. Another scholar, Ferguson, found the pillars so highly ornamented in details and varieties that no two pillars are exactly alike. At present not a single temple is in order. The pieces of old temples were removed and used in temples in distant cities. The many monuments were destroyed by contractors of Rajputana Malwa Railway before independence. The remaining were stolen or were destroyed when Abu Road industrial area was extended and Palanpur-Abu Road Highway was constructed. It divided the ancient site into two parts. Rulers of Chandravati also patronized literature. Jain monks wrote some literary works there. Archeology At least three fortified enclosures were discovered during excavations. The largest fortification is spread over four hectares and is located in the valley of Banas river. Three residential complexes; six room complex in south eastern corner, six room complex in north eastern corner and the large hall with few rooms in south central part of the fort; were discovered. Several minor objects were also discovered from the complexes like terracotta beads, copper and iron objects, animal figures. The other two fortifications, a large settlement, about thirty six temples, around twelve bawaris are located in the valley of Sevarni river which is tributary of Banas.

It enjoyed more success than its predecessor, Kikstart. The game allowed 2-player simultaneous (via a split- screen facility) or 1-player, vs-computer play. The basic premise is to control a bike using acceleration, braking, \\"hopping\\" and \\"wheelies\\" to navigate across a course of various obstacles, from ramps and gates to telephone boxes and tyres. The game was based on the BBC Television series Kick Start. An enhanced version was released for the Commodore 128, one of the few native mode game titles for that computer. Some obstacles only allowed travel across them in certain ways. For instance, fences and wooden beams can only be navigated at low speed, without \\"hopping\\" or falling onto them. Tyres would only allow travel at high speeds, driving slowly will \\"throw\\" the rider. When a rider lands badly (i.e. with the front wheel first) or \\"falls off\\" an obstacle, they are catapulted a certain distance forward, imposing a certain time penalty because the player is not put back into the game until the screen has scrolled to a \\"safe\\" (i.e. flat) area of the course on which to restart the bike. Players can either play against their opponent in a straight-out race to the finish post, or they can \\"win\\" by aggregated finishing times. Courses are played in sets of five, denoted by a letter of the alphabet and can be edited by the player using the built-in course designer. This allowed the user to place any obstacles on a blank track and later save and share completed courses. Reception The game was well received with critics. Many lists of Commodore 128 games included the title, as it was one of the only games released for 128 mode.

The ground is a public park and exclusively leased to the Port Adelaide Football Club for Australian rules football. History John Formby donated the land for Alberton Oval to the people of Port Adelaide for a sporting oval. With the nearby Queenstown Oval built upon in 1876, the Alberton and Queenstown Council opted to construct a cricketing ground on the land adjacent Brougham Place in 1876.Adelaide Observer, Saturday 13 May 1876, Page 6 The land was donated by the former Mayor of Port Adelaide, John Formby. The Queen and Albert Oval was officially opened on 8 November 1877 for a game between the touring Tasmanian cricket team and a selected eleven of the Queen and Albert Cricket Association.South Australian Register, 23 October 1877, page 1 Port Adelaide Football Club While several teams played at the Alberton Oval in the ground's early days, it is most famous for being the training and administration base for the Port Adelaide Football Club since it played its first game on 15 May 1880 and defeated the original, now-defunct Kensington Football Club 1-nil. Port Adelaide still plays its SANFL games at the ground, although AFL games are played at Adelaide Oval and, between 1997 and 2013, at AAMI Stadium. All of the club's teams, including its AFL team and its SANFL League and Academy teams, conduct their principal trainings at the ground. The Allan Scott Power Headquarters stands adjacent to the oval. So too does The Port Club, a social venue for the club's supporters and players, which was opened on 14 November 1954. Alberton is regarded as the \\"spiritual home\\" of Port AdelaideHistory, Port Adelaide Football Club. due to the club (in the SANFL) playing almost all of their homes games there since commencing its tenancy. The club's AFL team usually plays one or two trial games at the ground during the pre-season. Many notable Australian rules footballers have played for Port Adelaide on the ground, including 3 time Brownlow and Sandover Medalist Haydn Bunton Sr, four time SANFL Magarey Medal winner and club games record holder (392) Russell Ebert, nine time premiership coach Fos Williams, local junior and future Carlton player Craig Bradley, 1992 Best and Fairest winner Nathan Buckley, 1993 Brownlow Medallist Gavin Wanganeen and Port Adelaide's first ever AFL coach, John Cahill who also coached the club to 10 SANFL premierships.Alberton Oval, Port Adelaide Football Club.  Cheltenham cemetery curse  For a long time such was the Port Adelaide Football Club's dominance at Alberton Oval with a win percentage of 78% from its first year at the ground in 1880 to joining the AFL in 1997 there has been conjecture that opposition teams became cursed as they passed by Cheltenham cemetery on the way to the ground. Malcolm Blight as coach for Woodville played up the curse for his players in the lead up to a match, parking the bus before the cemetery, and making his players walk past Cheltenham cemetery. Unfortunately it didn't work and Woodville still lost but Blight suggests his team would've lost by more if he didn't make everyone walk past.

Following the opening game between Tasmania and the Queen and Albert Cricket Association in 1877, the ground became the home of the new Port Adelaide Cricket Club in 1897 and remained so until the end of 1996. In the early years attention needed to be paid to the state of the outfield. An example of this need was when Port Adelaide batsman G.S.P. Jones was able to run 8 while making 143 not out against West Torrens in 1904-05 because the fieldsman could not find the ball amongst the weeds. Cricket and football shared the use of the oval for a century, until the Port Adelaide Football Club was elevated into the AFL in 1997 and required the full-year use of the ground.Port Adelaide Cricket Club The cricket club now plays games at the Port Reserve in Port Adelaide.

History Early history Huttwil is first mentioned in the 9th Century as Huttiwilare. The Huttwil area was probably first settled in the 7th or 8th century, though it first appears in historic records in the 9th century. Initially it was part of the Upper Aargau lands of the Adalgoze family, though by the 11th and 12th centuries the Counts of Rheinfelden and Fenis-Neuch√¢tel owned land and rights in Huttwil. In the 12th century Fenis-Neuch√¢tel donated their Huttwil lands to Erlach Abbey. The village church is first mentioned in 1093 or 1108 when Agnes von Rheinfelden and her husband Berchtold II von Z√§hringen donated the patronage rights to the Abbey of Saint Peter in the Black Forest. The remainder of the Rheinfelden rights passed to the Z√§hringens through Agnes' marriage. When the Z√§hringen family died out in 1218 the Counts of Kyburg acquired the growing town and surrounding lands. In 1313 the Counts of Neu-Kyburg gave Huttwil to their overlord, the Austrian Habsburgs. Following the surprising Swiss Confederation and Bernese victory at the Battle of Laupen in 1339, Bernese troops destroyed the Habsburg town of Huttwil in 1340. Though the town was rebuilt and the Kyburgs remained in power Huttwil came increasingly under the Bernese sphere of influence. Over the following centuries it was owned by a Bernese noble family before being completely absorbed into the Bernese bailiwick of Trachselwald in 1516. In 1528 Bern adopted the new faith of the Protestant Reformation and Huttwil converted along with the rest of the Bernese lands. When they suppressed Erlach Abbey in the same year, the Abbey's rights and lands from the Counts of Fenis-Neuch√¢tel were acquired by Bern. Swiss peasant war of 1653 The allegiance oath of Huttwil, in the Peasant War of 1653 Some of the weapons used in the War During the Swiss peasant war of 1653, Huttwil was a center of the rebellion. On 23 April 1653, representatives of the people of the countryside of Lucerne, Bern, Basel, and Solothurn met at Sumiswald and concluded an alliance to help each other to achieve their goals. A week later, they met again at Huttwil, where they renewed that alliance and elected Niklaus Leuenberger from R√ºderswil in the Emmental as their leader.St√ºssi-Lauterburg, J.; Luginb√ºhl, H.; Gasser, A.; Greminger, A. (2003): Verachtet Herrenpossen! Versch√ºchet fremde G√§st!, Verlag Merker im Effingerhof, Lenzburg; 2003. , p. 44. On 14 May 1653, the peasants met again at a Landsgemeinde at Huttwil and formalized their alliance as the \\"League of Huttwil\\" by signing a written contract in the style of the old Bundesbriefe of the Old Swiss Confederacy. The treaty clearly established the league as a separate political entity that considered itself equal to and independent from the cities. The tax revolt had become an independence movement, based ideologically on the traditional Swiss founding legends, especially on the legend of William Tell. Legally, the peasants justified their assemblies and their union by the rights of old and in particular the Stanser Verkommnis of 1481, one of the important coalition treaties of the Old Swiss Confederacy.Holenstein, A.

Though the Huttwil League was initially successful and forced Bern and Lucerne to sign peace treaties and grant concessions, on 3 June 1653 they were decisively defeated in the Battle of Wohlenschwil. Bernese troops then burned villages and crushed further resistance over the following month. Niklaus Leuenberger was beheaded and quartered at Bern on September 6, 1653; his head was nailed at the gallows together with one of the four copies of the Bundesbrief of the Huttwil League.St√ºssi-Lauterburg 2003, p. 374. After the war to modern times Main street and Reformed church with its onion dome tower from 1834. Central plaza and fountain from the reconstruction after the 1834 fire. While the Swiss peasant war was unsuccessful, it forced Bernese authorities to reform the tax structure and respect the rights of the peasants. While Huttwil was the center of the revolt, it was not punished further by the authorities. Huttwil's location on the Bern-Lucerne road allowed it to continue to grow. While agriculture remained important, it became a regional market town and other industries began to develop. During the ancien regime period tensions rose between the well-off town citizens who owned much of the farming land and the poor sharecropper Tauner who worked the land and had few rights. Even the reforms of the 1798 French invasion and the Helvetic Republic failed to address the old power structure in the town. Finally in 1828, the citizens lost their special rights and the commons were divided between the former Tauner. Throughout the 19th century a number of factories and small shops opened in the town, including canvas weaving, spinning wool, horsehair spinning, knitting mills, tanneries, sawmills and furniture manufacturing. Today the manufacturing sector in Huttwil provides about one-third of all jobs in the municipality. On the night of 8/9 June 1834 much of the town was destroyed in a fire. The entire town was rebuilt according to plans from Bern's city architect, Johann Daniel Osterrieth. He planned a town center with three main roads around a central plaza with fountains. The streets were lined with half-timbered Country-Biedermeier houses which reflected the growing prosperity of the town. The village church was rebuilt on the old foundations, but with a higher tower and a new onion dome. An attempt to build a railway from Bern through Huttwil and the lower Emmental to Lucerne in 1871 failed. It took almost two decades before Huttwil was eventually connected to a railway. The Langenthal‚ÄìHuttwil railway opened in 1889, followed by the Huttwil‚ÄìWolhusen railway in 1895, the Ramsei-Sumiswald line in 1908 and the Eriswil line in 1915. The railway connected Huttwil to the rest of the country and allowed industry to grow in the town. The first three railways eventually merged into the United Huttwil Railway (Vereinigten Huttwil-Bahnen) which in 1997 became the Regionalverkehr Mittelland AG. Due to Huttwil being a regional center a secondary school opened in the town in 1873. A district hospital opened a few years later, in 1903. The original hospital was replaced with a new building in 1929 and the old hospital became a retirement home. In 1939 a Roman Catholic church was built in Huttwil for the Catholic residents of the village. The Brother Klaus Church was rebuilt to its current appearance in 1983.

It is currently the training base of the North Melbourne Football Club, an Australian rules football club, and up to the end of the 1985 season it was used as the team's home ground for Victorian Football League (VFL) matches. History The North Melbourne Recreation Reserve is an inner-suburban sporting facility which is distinguished by its long standing association with the North Melbourne Football Club; it has served as the home of North Melbourne for more than 125 years. Not much is known about the exact date that Arden St Oval was officially opened, but local history purports it as being as old as the suburb itself. The Hotham Cricket Club served as the ground's only tenants until 1882 when they amalgamated with the Hotham Football Club - as they were then known - to effect improvements to the ground. Before then, the Hotham Football Club had been playing home matches at Royal Park, near the present site of the Melbourne Zoo. The first game of Australian football ever played at the ground took place on 29 April 1882, when Hotham defeated Royal Park. Three years later, the ground became permanently reserved to the Crown. The football and cricket clubs changed their names to North Melbourne on 23 March 1888, after the Town of Hotham reverted to the name of North Melbourne in August 1887. The sharing agreement between the cricket and footy clubs was not all rosy, and by the late 1890s the two entities ended up in court over a dispute about the use of the cricket pavilion by a visiting football team. The court ruled in favour of the cricket club citing that since it was Crown land, it was illegal to fence off any part of it for the benefit of either party. Arden St in 1980. The 1928 Grandstand is to the North. Betting ring in the North-West. Harold Henderson Pavilion to the west. Outer sheds to the South and East The playing surface, previously notorious for becoming a gluepot in inclement weather, was upgraded during the winter of 1897, so no football was played there during that season. 1906 saw the construction of the ground's first grand stand. By mid-1909, the control of the Recreation Reserve had shifted to the Parks and Gardens Committee of the Melbourne City Council, meaning that the State Minister for Lands had final say over the use of the reserve. In 1921, the Essendon Football Club attempted to move to the ground after its home ground, the East Melbourne Cricket Ground, was closed, and the North Melbourne Football Club disbanded as it sought to amalgamate with Essendon; but the State Minister for Lands vetoed Essendon's move. This prompted Essendon to move to the Essendon Recreation Reserve, and the re-formed North Melbourne returned the following season to Arden Street. In 1922, management of the ground was transferred from the Melbourne City Council to the North Melbourne Football and Cricket Clubs. Improvements to the ground that year, made in an attempt to increase revenue, included the installation of hot showers in the change rooms. In early 1925, North Melbourne was finally admitted to the Victorian Football League (VFL). The invitation to join the VFL came at a time when local support for the club was at an all-time high prompting further upgrading of facilities. This included the construction of the main grandstand in 1928, with seating for 2,000 spectators. In 1965, North Melbourne moved its playing and training base from the Arden Street Oval to Coburg Oval. The move was intended to be permanent, with some initial negotiations seeking long-term leases for up to 40 years, but it was ultimately cancelled after only eight months, and North Melbourne returned to the Arden Street Oval in 1966. Until the late 1960s, the 1906 and 1928 grandstands were the only major structures associated with the Recreation Reserve, until the construction of the new administration building and Social Club after 1966. The North Melbourne Football Club continued to use the site as its home ground until 1985, when the club began using the Melbourne Cricket Ground for its home matches. The last VFL match was played there on 17 August 1985 when North Melbourne defeated Richmond by 50 points. The record attendance at the ground is 35,116 in 1949. The highest score was North Melbourne's 29.19 (193) in 1983 versus Carlton. The club continued to maintain the Arden Street Oval as a training and administrative base after shifting home games away. From 2002 until 2010, the club based its administration to offices at Docklands Stadium (which was then serving as its home ground), before returning to upgraded Arden Street Oval offices in early 2010; but it has maintained Arden Street as its training base continuously throughout that time. In 2006 the ground became the subject of an arson attack, with several portable buildings including the gymnasium, coaches' offices and players' lounge being destroyed by fire in the early hours of 22 July, the morning after the Kangaroos suffered a 72-point loss to the Adelaide Crows at AAMI Stadium. Links between the attack, the team's loss and speculation surrounding its future were quickly dismissed. Ground Improvements First Grand Stand The first grandstand was built in 1906 on the Fogarty Street side of the ground, at a reputed cost of ¬£850. Remnants of this stand, the concrete players‚Äô race and the base of one of the external staircases, remain in the terraced area. The players‚Äô race still connects the players‚Äô dressing rooms in the Football Club administration building with the oval. In 1909, plans for a new grandstand, to cost ¬£1,000, were drawn up by local councillor and club founder J H Gardiner. Despite the popularity of the club, it was deemed that too few finals games were scheduled for the ground to warrant the construction of another stand. 1928 Grand Stand North's move to the VFL in 1925 prompted significant upgrading of the club's facilities. Almost symbolic of the club's new status as a member of the VFL was the construction of the brick grandstand in 1928, with seating for 2,000 spectators. Located to the south-east of the existing 1906 stand, it was built on the site of the small timber pavilion, which was demolished, and another even smaller structure to the south-east which was apparently re-located elsewhere. The designer was H E Morton and the builder was J E Morison. 1928 Grandstand The foundation stone reads as follows: NORTH MELBOURNE RECREATION RESERVE THIS TABLET WAS UNVEILED BY THE RIGHT HONORABLE THE LORD MAYOR OF MELBOURNE ALDERMAN SIR STEPHEN MORELL ON SATURDAY 24TH MARCH 1928 COMMITTEE 1927-28 COUNCILLOR DR KENT HUGHES, CHAIRMAN L.

It housed the club gym for a few years before bird droppings inside the roof began to present a safety hazard. The grandstand was eventually demolished in 2006 after failed attempts to find funds to repair the structure, much to the disappointment of the North-West Melbourne Association. A new administration and football facility was built in its place. Harold R. Henderson Pavilion Harold Henderson Pavilion The Harold R Henderson Pavilion is the latest stand to be built. It was constructed in the late '60s following the club's disastrous move to the Coburg City Oval. Led by Allen Aylett and Harold R. Henderson, a committee was formed that aimed to redevelop the ground so that there would never be a repeat of the club's relocation to Coburg. Along with new administration facilities, a new first rate social club was built that became the envy of other VFL clubs during the 70s. The pavilion itself set a new benchmark in football standards, with the introduction of corporate hospitality where clients could enjoy the football in comfort. These improvements were responsible for the great success North achieved during the 70s. After 1985, the Pavilion was converted into the 'Kanga Kasino' that housed the clubs pokie machines. In 2002, North Melbourne acquired the Captain's Bar at the newly constructed Docklands Stadium, and the pokies were moved there. From 2002-2009 the Pavilion held the club gym, and North's official merchandise store the 'Roo Shop'. The Pavilion was demolished in 2009 as part of the development of the oval. Betting Ring The betting ring was a concreted area beneath a roof, behind the 1928 grandstand, on the corner of Arden and Fogarty streets. The betting ring was built for greyhound meetings that were held at Arden St from 1957-62. The dogs ran on a track that formed a perimeter around the cricket oval. While the betting ring was alive with punters and bookmakers, only those in the ring's top corner, at the northern end, had a view past the grandstand and across the terraces to the finishing line. After the demise of greyhound racing at Arden Street, the betting ring served as a car park and equipment shelter. Much of the area was taken up by the Bob Dempster Memorial Nets, which were built on the oval in 1975, before being shifted to the corner of the betting ring closest to the intersection of Arden and Fogarty streets. furniture.http://www.theage.com.au/news/Sport/Betting-ring-Arden- Street/2005/05/06/1115092682894.html In 2006, the betting ring was destroyed in an arson attack. Outer Shed At the eastern goals, and along the Macaulay Street boundary, stood small shelters for the spectators. These shelters were demolished in the aftermath of the 1985 Bradford City stadium fire in England, when the Metropolitan Fire Brigade declared them a fire hazard. The Gasometer Gasometer One of the iconic features of VFL football at Arden Street was the gigantic gasometer that towered over the ground.https://www.nmfc.com.au/news/302639/arden-st-gasometer The giant gas works structure was located along Macaulay Road and became synonymous with North Melbourne in the football world. The gasometer was so well known that Mick Nolan was affectionately labelled the \\"Galloping Gasometer\\" by footy fans due to his large size and resemblance to the structure. Tenants Apart from its aborted move to Coburg in 1965, and times when the ground was being upgraded, the Arden St Oval has served as the permanent home of the North Melbourne Football Club from 1882 until now. Apart from this, boxing, cricket, cycling, hurling and greyhound racing have all been accommodated at Arden Street Oval at some stage. The original tenant of the oval was the North Melbourne Cricket Club. The cricket club first started playing at the ground in 1868. The cricket club began to share the oval with the football club in 1882, with the football club using the oval in winter, and the cricket club using the oval in the summer. Historically this arrangement has been difficult and the North Melbourne cricket and football clubs have not got along. In 2007, the cricket club moved its First and Second XIs playing base to J. J. Holland Park in neighbouring Kensington, but its Third and Fourth XIs remained at Arden Street; the club left Arden Street altogether in 2010, playing and training nomadically at Holland Park, Albert Park and Royal Park for a couple of years before moving permanently to the outer north-western suburb of Greenvale in 2013. From 1957-62, the Melbourne Greyhound Racing Association used Arden St to hold its Greyhound meetings. The dogs ran on a track that formed a perimeter around the oval. Races were held on Monday nights and regularly attracted crowds of 5000, with double that number in attendance on the night when Rookie Rebel won the first Australian Cup in 1958. The Arden Street days are described as being the best in the history of Melbourne greyhound racing. Melbourne Greyhound Racing Association shifted its meetings to Olympic Park in 1962 after the Arden Street's ground committee sought to cash in on the popularity of the dogs by doubling the rent. In the winter of 1965, after North Melbourne had moved to Coburg, Arden Street Oval was rented by the VFL ‚Äì in large part to prevent other football codes from renting it. The VFL used it junior football, umpire training, school programs, and from June it was used as a central ground for the Essendon District Football League game-of-the-week. Redevelopment In 2007, it was announced by Club Chairman Graham Duff that the facilities at the Arden Street Oval would get a $10 million upgrade, including new facilities for the State Fencing Centre.Training facilities will be AFL's best: Duff The new facilities would be ready in time for the 2009 AFL Season and allow the club to move administration from Etihad Stadium to the ground. The upgraded facilities will also serve the community with a Gymnasium, Basketball Courts and Change rooms. The new administration of James Brayshaw worked with various Government agencies including the Melbourne City Council, Victorian State Government, and the Commonwealth Government to have the new facilities increased in size and value from the original $10 million, to a final plan costing $16 million, and providing the NMFC and local community with some of the best amenities of any club in the AFL. The new development was opened in time for the 2010 season. The development includes offices for the football department and administration of the NMFC as well as training facilities. As housed in the building is a fencing centre, community gym, basketball court and 'The Huddle' which is a community learning centre. In 2013 Arden Street was touted as a possible location for the proposed new 'boutique Stadium' in Melbourne. Other possible sites included Punt Road Oval, home of the Richmond Football Club. In 2016, the North Melbourne Football Club announced they would be playing a game against Hawthorn at Arden Street Oval as part of the 2017 pre-season competition.

Early life Born in SolihullBrad Moran in the West Midlands of England to English parents, his father Martyn was a former junior soccer player. Moran grew up in Stratford-upon-Avon with dreams of becoming a soccer player. As a youth, he represented West Midlands county in rugby union. He was also a representative soccer player. Moran moved to Australia with his family as a 15-year-old, looking to pursue a career in rugby. One of his school friends encouraged him to try Aussie Rules with the Surfers Paradise AFC juniors, where he was mentored by former Brisbane Bears captain Roger Merrett. He took to the game quickly and developed a passion for it. His high school, The Southport School had a policy against Australian Football being part of its curriculum, so he had to remain playing club football and instead also played rowing and basketball at school. Moran quickly showed ability and talent in the ruck. He broke his wrist leading up to the Under 18 national championships, which set back his recruitment. However, after playing football with the Southport Sharks, at age 18 he was recruited to the elite level by the Kangaroos Football Club in the 2004 AFL Draft.Moran shines first-up AFL career Wearing the number 18 guernsey, previously worn by Wayne Carey, Moran made his debut in 2006 against Hawthorn at Aurora Stadium. He played an effective game in one of the Roos' worst performances of the season. He collected 21 disposals, 10 marks and 10 hitouts, which earned a nomination for the AFL Rising Star Award. He continued his good form into next week against Collingwood, where the Roos were comprehensively beaten in the second half. Moran was traded to the Adelaide Football Club at the end of the 2007 Premiership season. He took up the number 2 guernsey, which was also previously worn by Carey during his brief stint at the Crows.AdelaideNow... Moran's half-back hopes After injuries ruined the first half of his 2008 season, he played his first game for the Crows in round 16 and impressed as a tall defender and ruckman, thereafter becoming a fixture in the lineup. When moved into the forward line against Carlton in round 18 to cover the loss of Jason Porplyzia, Moran booted four goals for the game to help the Crows to an eight-point victory, thus adding another string to his bow as a utility. In 2009 Moran quickly became a regular in the Adelaide side, forming a ruck combination with Ivan Maric. However, midway through the season he injured his knee, which would keep him out for the remainder of the season. Moran announced his retirement on 31 August 2011 after ongoing injuries. International qualification In 2008, although Moran was eligible to represent Great Britain at the 2008 Australian Football International Cup (the criteria at the time allowed him to as he had moved to Australia as a teenager), he was deliberately overlooked by the national teamBrits stick to home grown talent because he did not learn the game in England. However Moran is keen to see the sport grow in his former home and is an ambassador for Aussie Rules International, appearing in an England Dragonslayers guernsey for its junior league promotions.

In the site traces of a Roman era villa have been found, which legend attributes as belonging to Nero himself. History Acquaviva Within the comune is the frazione of Acquaviva, on the ancient Via Salaria. This may have been the seat of the bishopric called Aquaviva in Latin, whose bishops took part in synods held in Rome in the second half of the 5th century and the beginning of the 6th: Paulus or Paulinus in 465, Benignus in 487, 497, and 502, and Bonifacius in 503.Gaetano Moroni, Dizionario di erudizione storico- ecclesiastica, vol. 1, p. 73 No longer a residential bishopric, Aquaviva is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.Annuario Pontificio 2013 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 ), p. 823 Castello Orsini di Nerola left In the second half of the 10th century, the castle Castrum Nerulae was founded by the \\"Sabine chancellor\\" Benedetto Crescenzi, and the Crescenzi family held it until 1235, when it came under the direct control of the pope. At the end of the 12th century, the fiefdom was granted to the Orsini family, who built the present Castello Orsini. At the end of the 15th century, the castle was subsequently reinforced with strong towers and other defensive fortifications around the village. Near the castle, the chiesa vecchia (Old Church) was built in 1483.Nerola and Monteflavio In 1644, the castle and the territory of Nerola were yielded to the Barberini family along with the Montelibretti family and, in 1728, entered into possession of the Sciarra clan, and thence to the Lante della Rovere family, who founded the charitable institution of the Ospedale dei Pellegrini to assist travellers on the Via Salaria. In 1867, the castle was occupied by a contingent of partisans of Giuseppe Garibaldi who were fighting against papal troops. Since passing to Marquis Ferrari-Frey in 1939, the castle has been restored and now houses a hotel.

Etymology Pinkerton Syndrome is derived from the 1904 opera Madama Butterfly by Giacomo Puccini, based on the 1898 short story Madame Butterfly by John Luther Long. The term \\"Pinkerton\\" is in reference to the character Lieutenant B. F. Pinkerton, a white U.S. Navy officer who marries a Japanese girl for convenience while docked in Nagasaki, but plans to abandon her when his ship departs Japan and to find a White American wife.

However, when the Japanese wife later finds out that Pinkerton has indeed abandoned her and married a white American woman, she commits suicide.  Empirical evidence  Empirical evidence for the Pinkerton syndrome was first examined in Singapore. After a cursory search of Singapore's online media, it was argued that the Pinkerton syndrome is not restricted to interpersonal attraction. As such, the Pinkerton syndrome was redefined broadly \\"as the tendency for Asians to be prejudiced and to discriminate in favor of Caucasians.\\" In a simulated hiring decision task, Singaporean Chinese participants rated a Caucasian job applicant as more suitable for the job and recommended them a higher salary than an equally qualified Chinese applicant.

Background Sam Shockley was born in Cerro Gordo, Caney Township, Little River County, Arkansas. His father, Richard \\"Dick\\" Shockley, was a sharecropper who married three times and had eight children. As a newborn baby, Sam survived an accident when his 9-year-old sister, Myrtle, was looking after the other children while their parents worked on the land; with baby Sam on her arm, she came too close to the fireplace and her dress caught fire. She ran out of the house and collapsed, throwing the baby clear, and both lay outside for six hours. Both were burned, and Sam had fallen hard. Sam's mother, Annyer Eugenia, Richard's second wife, died when Sam was 7 years old. Sam started running away from home after his stepmother, Sally Barton, died of malaria in 1920. When he was 12, his father took him out of school to work in the fields; his formal education ended at the third grade. By the age of 13 he exhibited signs of serious instability. In 1927 he left the family for good and became a transient. Soon after that he was arrested for stealing chickens, automobile tires and accessories in Garvin County, Oklahoma, and on July 3, 1928 was sentenced to one year in the Oklahoma State Reformatory at Granite. While in prison Sam Shockley was beaten by a fellow inmate, suffering brain damage and numerous scars on his head and neck. He was released in July 1929. In the early 1930s he was arrested several times for drunkenness and disorderly conduct, escaped from the jail in Birmingham, Alabama, and was beaten by a police officer, receiving further head trauma. In June 1936, Shockley married Betty Moore (born 1923 in Shoshone, Idaho), but the marriage only lasted a year and a half. They divorced in June 1939. In March 1938, Shockley was arrested with Edward Johnson for robbing a man of his car, robbing the bank of Paoli, Oklahoma, and kidnapping two employees, Mr and Mrs D. F. Pendley; Shockley attempted to escape during the arrest. They were sentenced on May 16, 1938 to life imprisonment at the U.S. Penitentiary at Leavenworth, Kansas. When examined by prison psychiatrists at Leavenworth, Shockley was determined to have a low IQ of 68 and a mental age of 10 years, 10 months. According to the report, he suffered episodes of hallucinations and demonstrated serious emotional instability and was incapable of coping with the normal prison environment, presenting a risk to himself and others. Rather than transferring him to the Medical Center for Federal Prisoners at Springfield, Missouri, the administration at Leavenworth sent him to Alcatraz on September 23, 1938, where it was believed the strict routine would better manage him. Alcatraz Shockley was placed for three years in the D block isolation section, for most of the time in the \\"Hole\\" or \\"Dungeon\\", the darkened, stripped cells on the ground level, where he spent most of his time in darkness. At night, he was allowed a blanket and a mattress; during the day he was sitting and lying on the cold concrete. His condition deteriorated. He displayed classic schizophrenic symptoms: delusions, auditory hallucinations, and disorientation. His IQ dropped to 54, indicating a mental age of 8. In 1942 the Alcatraz prison physician described him as emotionally very unstable with episodes of hallucinations. On May 21, 1941, Shockley was involved with Joe Cretzer, Arnold \\"Shorty\\" Kyle, and Lloyd Barkdoll (an Oregon bankrobber) in an attempted escape from one of the island's workshops. The men held a number of guards hostage while attempting to saw through the steel bars from the inside. After an hour of unsuccessful sawing, they surrendered and released their hostages unharmed after the arrival of the guard captain, Paul Madigan. Barkdoll managed to speak with Warden James Johnston and convinced him that Shockley was not involved in the plot, and Shockley was released and sent back to his cell. On May 2, 1946, during an attempted escape, inmates Bernard Coy, Joseph Cretzer, and Marvin Hubbard took custodial guard Cecil Corwin by surprise. They had planned to take control of the cell house and the D isolation cell block in order to free inmate Rufus Whitey Franklin from the isolation block, but none of the keys they had fit the rear door leading to the recreation yard, their intended escape route; custodial guard Joseph Burdett had hidden this key under the wall seat of cell 404. As designed, the lock jammed after repeated attempts to open it with the wrong key. A 48-hour armed confrontation ensued, in which two custodial guards, Bill Miller and Harold Stites, and three inmates, Coy, Cretzer and Hubbard, were killed. 13 guards were injured, three critically. Shockley was tried for participation in the attempted escape and the killing and injury of the guards. Judge Louis Goodman appointed William A. Sullivan to defend Shockley. Goodman elicited a statement from custodial guard Carl W. Sundstrom that he had at no time seen a weapon in Shockley's hands, and that while Shockley did attack Sundstrom, he did not injure Sundstrom at any time. Sundstrom also stated that Sam Shockley was running around and acting like a crazy man. Other inmates such as Jack Pepper, James Quillen, Howard Butler, Edwin Sharp, and Louis Fleish made statements that Sam Shockley was running up and down the corridors carrying a wrench and wearing an officer's jacket several sizes too large for him, and repeatedly swore at the hostages. Also the men all established that Shockley was in the D block when the shooting began that injured the guards taken hostage, and later killed guard W. H. Miller. Inmate Joseph Moyle testified that Sam Shockley did not say anything; he was just standing at the hostage cells, and he did not think Shockley knew what was going on. He and other inmates who testified in court denied that they ever heard Sam Shockley urge Joseph Cretzer to shoot the guards. Sam Shockley was not a part of the plan at all and merely tagged along because no one told him he could not. If Sam Shockley was to have been a key figure in helping Bernie Coy enter the gun gallery, he would not have risked being placed in a solitary cell by smashing and setting fire to his cell in the riot of March 1946. If there had been enough solitary cells available, Shockley would have been locked up in one as Franklin had been. The failure to release Rufus Franklin was a good indication that no one in D Block had been aware of the break prior to its occurrence. Joseph Moyle agreed to testify as an important defense witness, but Warden Johnston handed Sullivan a letter in which Moyle declared that he no longer wished to be summoned as a witness in the court case because it would not be in his interest. With this, Sullivan lost one of his best witnesses in the case. Judge Goodman denied a motion for a separate trial for each of the defendants, on the ground that they could not receive a fair trial if they were tried together because the acts of each defendant would be considered by the jury to be acts of all, and also a motion for transfer of the trial, on the ground that the widespread adverse publicity and press coverage would prevent the defendants from obtaining a fair trial. Judge Goodman also denied a request for two lawyers to assist Sam Shockley, and a request for an independent psychiatrist to testify that Shockley was mentally ill or insane. Dr. Alden, the court-appointed psychiatrist, was the only medical witness to testify regarding the issue of Shockley's sanity, and had only an hour to examine Shockley. Frank Hennessy, the U.S. Attorney, and Judge Goodman feared a repetition of the 1941 trial of Henri Young, in which the jury publicly attacked Warden Johnston's administration as cruel and inhumane, and demanded that Alcatraz be closed and the administration investigated by the United States Marshals Service. Young, like Shockley, was non-aggressive and mentally handicapped, had been confined for lengthy periods in isolation and had a long record of minor misbehavior for which he had been harshly punished, and had almost complete lack of recall of the events for which he was on trial. On December 21, 1946, Sam Shockley, along with Miran Thompson and Clarence Carnes, was found guilty of murder in the first degree at their trial before the Circuit Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit in San Francisco. Carnes, who was 19, was spared the death penalty after some custodial officers who had been taken hostage testified that he had refrained from following instructions from Cretzer to kill them, but also due to the strong defense of his lawyer, Archer Zamloch. Although Sam Shockley's lawyer, W. A. Sullivan, pleaded insanity, Sam Shockley and Miran Thompson both received death sentences, to the great disbelief of their lawyers and even the prosecuting U.S. attorney, Hennessy. President Truman, a good friend of Warden Johnston, denied the bid for clemency. Shockley accepted his fate and rejected any further efforts to stay the execution. He and Thompson were executed simultaneously in the San Quentin gas chamber on December 3, 1948. Sam Shockley is buried at Pollard cemetery in Haworth, Oklahoma.

Life as a designer Speliopoulos studied fashion at Parsons School of Design in New York and graduated with a BFA in 1981. Speliopoulos is best friends with fashion designer Isaac Mizrahi who also attended Parsons. His first job as a fashion designer was as assistant stylist with Laura Biagiotti in Rome in 1982. He then worked briefly at the French couture house of Christian Dior and later for New York sportswear designer Gloria Sachs whose label went out of business in 1992. In 1985, Speliopoulos was named creative director at Carolyne Roehm Inc., a New York fashion house that had been created in 1984. He left in 1991 to become fashion director with Joseph Abboud. From 1993 to 1997, Speliopoulos then worked as a designer for Donna Karan in New York. He replaced Narcisco Rodriguez as head of design for the women's collection at Nino Cerruti in mid-1997. While at Cerruti, he gave the label a fresh modern look using fine detail and exquisite fabrics. He left Cerruti in 2002 to return to New York as Vice President of Design for Donna Karan New York. He has stayed with Donna Karan, a fashion house owned by the French LVMH Group, since then. In 1998 he said that his time at Donna Karan between 1993 and 1997 \\"was invaluable to me in getting to where I am now at Cerruti.\\" (Source: Interview Magazine). Speliopoulos has also worked as a costume designer for Karole Armitage, a New York ballet dancer who owns her own dance company. In the summer of 2000, he designed the costumes for the Athens Opera production of The Birds by Aristophanes. The collaboration with Armitage continued until 2003. He has also worked as a costume designer with the Rambert Dance Company in London for which Karole Armitage was a choreographer. He says that he is always inspired by the construction of Balenciaga, the essentialism of Halston and the genius of Yves St. Laurent. He tries to make his garments a mix of feminine sensuality and men's tailoring, creating versatility in a woman's wardrobe. Speliopoulos - together with his partner for more than 20 years, Robert Turner - is a Friends for Life Annual Fund donor at the GMHC.

Justice Cole handed the commission's five volume report to the Governor-General on 24 November 2006; and the report was tabled in parliament on 27 November 2006. Background The Volcker Inquiry was set up to investigate the systematic corruption of the Oil-for-Food Programme (or Program) by the Arab nationalist and Arab socialist government of the fifth President of Iraq, Saddam Hussein. The Volcker Inquiry The United Nations Independent Inquiry Committee was formed to investigate allegations of corruption and fraud in the UN Oil-for-Food Programme. Paul Volcker's report, released in October 2005, found that AWB Limited (AWB) was the biggest single source of kickbacks made to the Iraqi government. In exchange for trouble-free disembarkation of wheat purchased under the Oil for food program, AWB paid 'trucking charges' totaling 300 million to Alia, a Jordanian trucking company. Volcker found that Alia kept a small percentage of the 'charges', and passed the remainder to the government of Saddam Hussein. An accompanying statement released with the report by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan requested that ‚Äúnational authorities take steps to prevent the recurrence of such practices in the future and that they take action, where appropriate, against companies falling within their jurisdiction.‚Äù Establishment of the Cole Inquiry In response to Volcker's findings, the Australian Government established a Royal Commission to further investigate the claims raised by the UN report. By Letters Patent issued on 10 November 2005 the commission was asked to inquire into and report on: # whether any decision, action, conduct, payment or writing of any of the three Australian companies mentioned in the Final Report (‚ÄúManipulation of the Oil-for-Food Programme by the Iraqi Regime‚Äù) of the Independent Inquiry Committee into the United Nations Oil-for-Food Programme, or any person associated with one of those companies, might have constituted a breach of any law of the Commonwealth, a State or Territory; and # if so, whether the question of criminal or other legal proceedings should be referred to the relevant Commonwealth, State or Territory agency. Commissioner and Counsel The Royal Commissioner was The Honourable Justice Terence Cole , a former Judge of Appeal of the New South Wales Supreme Court. The Cole Inquiry was the second Royal Commission where Justice Cole was the sole Commissioner. The 2001-2003 Royal Commission into the Building and Construction Industry is commonly referred to as the Cole Royal Commission hence to avoid confusion the 2005-06 Royal Commission is commonly referred to as the Cole Inquiry. Cole was supported by John Agius SC, Counsel Assisting and three other barristers, Gregory Nell, Michael Wigney and Miles Condon. The three Australian companies adversely mentioned in the UN report (AWB Limited, Alkaloids of Australia Pty Limited, and Rhine Ruhr Pty Ltd) were granted leave to be represented by counsel before the Royal Commission Hearings Prior to the public hearings the commission held a series of closed hearings in December 2005 and January 2006. Some witnesses who were examined in the closed hearings also gave evidence in the public hearings. The commission's public hearings commenced on 16 January 2006. During the first six weeks of public hearings evidence led by Agius and cross examination by him of witnesses brought out a series of revelations that showed the conduct of AWB Limited's executives and directors in a very poor light. Apart from interrupting assisting counsel's question to ask witnesses his own probing questions, Cole frequently made reproving comments about the behaviour and evidence of witnesses particularly those in responsible and often highly remunerative positions with AWB Limited and the Wheat Export Authority, who among other things frequently claimed memory loss, inability to locate diaries and notes and notoriously, in the case of former AWB Limited board chairman Trevor Flugge, hearing loss. On 6 February 2006 the inquiry's terms of reference were extended to include the activities of companies in the BHP Billiton Group and associated companies in relation to the Oil for Food Program. On 16 February 2006 Commissioner Cole invited broadcast media into the inquiry's hearing room to record an invitation to anyone with information about kickbacks or the Iraqi oil-for-food scandal to appear before his inquiry. Cole emphasised that this appeal applied to anyone saying: \\"I am extending a specific invitation to any Member of Parliament, any member of the media, any public servant, or any member of the public who believes that they have information relevant to this aspect of the inquiry to provide any such information to those assisting me\\". On 2 March 2006 counsel assisting, John Agius, threatened to serve search warrants on AWB Limited following claims of memory lapses and loss of documents by a former company manager, Andrew McConville. This was countered by counsel for AWB Limited who suggested that the search for documents by the company was being conducted in a rigorous manner and at considerable expense. On 3 March 2006, Cole applied for the inquiry's terms of reference to be amended to extend the period of the inquiry for up to two months (i.e. from the end of March to May 2006). Prime Minister John Howard indicated the government's agreement to this request two days later. Prime Minister John Howard was asked to write and submit a statement in regard to this matter, and was \\"cross examined\\" on 13 April for 53 minutes. Howard previously stated to a media conference held in Sydney, \\"If asked I will naturally be happy to appear.\\" \\"I've said all along that this is an utterly transparent process, which is not protecting the Government, which is designed to get to the truth of this matter and I am more than happy to comply with the request made by the commission.\\" Outcome On 28 August 2009 the Australian Federal Police (AFP) decided to drop its investigation into the scandal in which wheat exporter AWB was found to have been funding the Iraqi regime in breach of UN sanctions. It was found that it was not even clear that breaching a UN sanction is a criminal offence and a conviction \\"was not in the public interest\\". The decision means no former employee or director of AWB will face criminal charges, although an investigation by corporate watchdog Australian Securities and Investment Commission continued. The AFP announced that the decision to drop the investigation was made after a review of the evidence by senior barrister Paul Hastings QC, who declared the prospect of convictions was limited and \\"not in the public interest\\". In 2009, The Australian reported \\"It has hardly been a secret that the AFP investigation was under-funded and under-resourced, and it received little co-operation from AWB, which sees itself as a new entity, with all staff associated with the corrupt dealings having left.\\" Hastings told the AFP that in his opinion there was no reasonable prospect of a conviction. It was not even clear that breaching a UN sanction is a criminal offence.

Poke (Hawaiian for \\"to slice\\" or \\"cut crosswise into pieces\\"; sometimes stylized Pok√© to aid pronunciation, also called Pok√© Bowl) is diced raw fish served either as an appetizer or as a main course and is one of the main dishes of Native Hawaiian cuisine. Traditional forms are aku (skipjack tuna) and he ªe (octopus). He ªe (octopus) poke is usually called by its Japanese name tako poke, except in places like the island of Ni ªihau where the Hawaiian language is spoken. Increasingly popular ahi poke is made with yellowfin tuna. Adaptations may feature raw salmon or various shellfish as a main ingredient served raw with the common poke seasonings. History The traditional Hawaiian poke consists of fish that has been gutted, skinned, and deboned. It is served with traditional condiments such as sea salt, candlenut, seaweed, and limu. According to the food historian Rachel Laudan, the present form of poke became popular around the 1970s. It used skinned, deboned, and filleted raw fish served with Hawaiian salt, seaweed, and roasted, ground candlenut meat. This form of poke is still common in the Hawaiian islands.

Unlike traditional Hawaiian poke, the mainland style is typically not pre-marinated, but is instead prepared with sauces on demand. Contemporary poke restaurants are mostly‚Äîbut not exclusively‚Äîfast casual style restaurants where the dish is fully customizable from the base to the marinade on the fish. They may use other seafood but ahi tuna is the most popular. There is a three-day \\"I Love Poke\\" festival to celebrate the dish and its many variations. Ingredients Poke began with fishermen seasoning the cut-offs from their catch to serve as a snack. While poke is a regional American-based cuisine from Hawaii, traditional poke seasonings have been heavily influenced by Japanese and other Asian cuisines. These include soy sauce, green onions, and sesame oil. Others include furikake (mix of dried fish, sesame seeds, and dried seaweed), chopped dried or fresh chili pepper, limu (seaweed), sea salt, inamona (roasted crushed candlenut), fish eggs, wasabi, and Maui onions. Other variations of poke may include cured hee (octopus), other types of raw tuna, raw salmon and various kinds of shellfish. Traditional Hawaiian poke may consist of cubed raw fish, maui onions, Inamona (a condiment made of roasted, salted candlenut), Limu, soy sauce, green onions, or sesame oil. Octopus (He ªe) poke with tomatoes, green onion, maui onion, soy sauce, sesame oil, sea salt, and chili pepper Similar dishes Poke comes from the same culinary and linguistic origins as other Polynesian fish salads such as oka in Samoa, ika mata in the Cook Islands, and kokoda in Fiji. A very similar dish is the kinilaw of the Philippines, known as the \\"Philippine ceviche\\". Kinilaw is usually raw diced fish marinated in citrus juice, sour fruits, or vinegar with extracts from mangrove bark or fruits (and sometimes coconut milk). It is indigenous to the islands, with traces recovered from archaeological sites dated to the 10th to 13th centuries AD. This process can also be applied to other seafood and lightly blanched or grilled meat (the latter being generally differentiated as kilawin). The dish was introduced to Guam during the Spanish colonial period, resulting in the derivative Chamorro dish of kelaguen. The Ilocano dish poqui poqui of the Philippines also likely derived its name from poke, after the influx of Ilocano sugarcane workers to Hawaii during the American colonization of the Philippines. However, they are very different dishes, with poqui poqui being a scrambled egg dish with grilled eggplants and tomatoes. Raw fish dishes similar to poke that are often served in Europe are fish carpaccio and fish tartare. Also similar to poke are Korean hoedeopbap, marinated raw tuna served over rice, and Peruvian ceviche. Japanese sashimi also consists of raw seafood; other similar Japanese dishes are zuke don, a donburi dish topped with cured fish (usually tuna or salmon) along with avocado topped with furikake, and kaisendon, a more elaborate version served with additional non-fish toppings.

They were active from 1995 to 2002 and briefly reunited in 2012 and 2016. The group released three albums on Up Records, a fourth on Tiger Style Records, and several other releases, including a collaborative single with their frequent touring partners Modest Mouse. The band initially comprised singer and guitarist John Atkins and drummer Polly Johnson. The lineup was expanded with the addition of bassist James Bertram in 1998, followed by his replacement Robin Peringer in 2000. The band's music was frequently likened to that of other groups from the Pacific Northwest, and described as the \\"perfect soundtrack\\" for the region. History Formation, Salt Sinks & Sugar Floats and singles (1995‚Äì1998) The group was formed in 1995 by John Atkins, a Seattle native and member of Hush Harbor, and Polly Johnson of the band Bell Jar. The two met through David Dickenson, Atkins's coworker and Johnson's partner, who would soon establish Suicide Squeeze Records. The new group remained nameless until its first show, when a friend recommended that they use the Washington State Department of Transportation telephone number for reporting carpool lane violators. The duo debuted with the \\"High School Poetry\\" 7\\" on Up Records later that year. In the following year, they issued both the \\"Now You're Swimming\\" 7\\" on Suicide Squeeze and their debut album, Salt Sinks & Sugar Floats, on Up. AllMusic critic Ari Wiznitzer described the latter as especially derivative of Pacific Northwestern music in a retrospective review. The group began attracting a national audience, next releasing the We're Solids EP in 1997. In early 1998, they released Whenever You See Fit, a collaborative single with Modest Mouse. The single's A-side consisted of a single, 14-minute long track that the two groups co-composed and performed while touring together. The B-side contained two remixes, one each by DJ Dynomite D and Scntfc. The record received mixed reviews, though critics praised the remixes.Spin, December 1998, \\"Singles,\\" pp. 170 As a trio, Get Here and Stay and Weekends of Sound (1998‚Äì2000) In 1998, the band asked James Bertram from Red Stars Theory, and formerly Lync and Beck, to join them as bass guitarist during a radio session. The session was successful, and Bertram joined the band officially thereafter. The new lineup recorded the band's second full-length record, Get Here and Stay, recorded with Built to Spill producer Phil Ek. PopMatters critic Jeremy Schneyer called the album a mix of melancholia and pop sensibilities that stood as \\"the band's high water mark\\". After several tours, the band recorded Weekends of Sound in early 2000, again with Ek. Writing for Pitchfork, Ryan Kearney described the album as \\"their most accomplished work to date\\" and characterized by \\"crisp production\\". Nobody Knows This Is Everywhere, breakup (2000‚Äì2002) After a tour of the United States with Modest Mouse in support of the album, Bertram left the band. Robin Peringer, whom Atkins and Johnson had met as a touring guitarist with Modest Mouse, replaced Bertram. Peringer was initially a temporary replacement but soon became a full member. In 2001, Atkins joined with friend Joe Plummer to perform songs he felt would not fit 764-HERO. The two formed The Magic Magicians and released their debut album Girls later that year. 764-HERO moved to Tiger Style Records for their final release, Nobody Knows This Is Everywhere, and began touring in its support in March 2002. The album name was a reference to Neil Young's album Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere. The album met with mixed reviews; it was praised by loud paper critic Antonio Girafez as \\"beautiful and unsettling\\", but was criticized by Pitchfork's Rob Mitchum for being \\"mediocre\\" and \\"boring\\" overall. The band broke up later that year, on the eve of their first tour of Japan. Post- breakup and reunions The Magic Magicians continued, releasing their self- titled album in 2003. In 2004, Atkins formed The Can't See with friends Thomas Wright and Ken Jarvey. In 2006 they released Coma Comma no More. Atkins later collaborated with Spencer Moody of the Murder City Devils in the John and Spencer Booze Explosion. Ten years after disbanding, 764-HERO reunited on March 4, 2012 for a secret show in Seattle. A week later, the band belatedly toured Japan, embarking on five dates with Japanese band Moools. Atkins and Johnson were joined by Ken Jarvey on bass. The original two-piece lineup reunited briefly in 2016, playing the Suicide Squeeze Records 20th Anniversary Party on August 25. Their two-song set comprised \\"Now You're Swimming\\", the first song ever released on the label, and a cover of Elliott Smith's \\"Division Day\\".

The station has a single center platform between two tracks. Bascom station is served by the Green Line of the VTA Light Rail system. Location Bascom station is located along the Southwest Expressway near the intersection of Bascom Avenue, after which the station was named. The Los Gatos Creek Trail trailhead is located about a block away from the station. History Bascom station was built as part of the Vasona Light Rail extension project. This project extended VTA light rail service from the intersection of Woz Way and West San Carlos St in San Jose in a southwesterly direction to the Winchester station in western Campbell. The official opening date for this station was October 1, 2005. The construction of this station and the rest of the Vasona Light Rail extension was part of the 1996 Measure B Transportation Improvement Program. Santa Clara County voters approved the Measure B project in 1996 along with a one half percent sales tax increase. The Vasona Light Rail extension was funded mostly by the resulting sales tax revenues with additional money coming from federal and state funding, grants, VTA bond revenues, and municipal contributions. Screens Metal screens that adorn the shelter of the Bascom VTA light rail station. San Jose artist Diana Pumpelly Bates has created metal screens for the shelters that provide visual interest for passengers at the stations as well as for motorists and pedestrians passing by the stations.

Description This species is thin and has long limbs and a pointy snout. Adult males are rarely larger than 6.5 cm, while females can grow up to 8 cm. Its ventral surface is light brown, reddish- brown, or light greyish-brown with very little contrast. Triangle-shaped spots reach from the temple to the eardrum, which are dark brown. The underside of the agile frog is white without any spots. During mating season, the males often become dark brown. The hind legs are unusually long, which allow this species to jump further than other similar frogs - they have been known to jump up to two metres in distance. The pupils are horizontal. The colour of the upper third of the iris (above the pupil) is lighter and gold in coloration. The tympanum is about the size of the diameter of the eye. The gland stripes on the frog's back are not very developed and partially interrupted. Agile frog Distribution The agile frog can be found in France, the Channel Islands, parts of Germany, Italy, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Austria, Hungary, on the Balkans, Greece, and by the Black Sea. The species once lived in the United Kingdom, during middle Saxon times, after archaeological remains were recovered in East Anglia. Reproduction Typically fixed spawn clump under water The call is a fairly quiet \\"rog ... rog ... rog\\", and can last for up to 12 seconds, and almost sounds like a clucking chicken (listen here - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIQhT4Z8LK0). They often also call under water, so the calls can only be heard from a very short distance by observers. Spawning only lasts a few days, and during this period, the males sometimes gather in large calling groups on the water surface to attract females. In Central Europe, spawning usually occurs in the first 20 days of March, but can also be delayed, depending on the weather. The spawn clumps consist of 450 to 1800 eggs, and are usually attached to tree branches, roots, or plant stems at depths of . Therefore, they rarely sink to the bottom. Unlike the moor frog (Rana arvalis) and common frog (Rana temporaria), the agile frog does not lay its spawn all in one clump. The diameter of a single egg, not counting the gelatinous shell, is . Habitat The agile frog prefers light deciduous mixed forests with plentiful water. The open land around a forest is often also populated, as long as it is connected to the forest by shrubs. In dry, warm forests, this species often also lives far away from the water. Of the three Middle European Rana species, this frog likes warmth and dryness the most.

Eina is located a mere 12 km south of Raufoss, and has its center just north of Einavatnet (or Einafjorden). From Einavatnet comes the river Hunnselva which travels north to Mj√∏sa. Some 1,500 people inhabit the area surrounding the lake, not including Eina. Picture of Eina facing south. The lake seen is Einavatnet; the railroad track is that of Gj√∏vikbanen. History The area has been populated since before the early 11th century, but did not see significant growth until the Norwegian industrialization. This was due to the railroad line Gj√∏vikbanen being built, which brought passengers and freight to and through the village. In 1902, the local railroad station stood ready, and in 1908 Eina would become a municipality on its own when Vestre Toten split into three (Eina, Kolbu and Vestre Toten). At this time, Eina had 1,173 inhabitants, and was experiencing significant economic growth. In 1964, Eina merged with Vestre Toten, by then having grown to 1,591 inhabitants. Valdresbanen Eina was also connected to Valdresbanen, another railroad line, until it closed. Valdresbanen was built in 1906, and was originally a privately owned line, until the government assumed control in 1937. It covered the distance from Eina to Fagernes, which is located in Nord-Aurdal. The track was 109 km long, and was closed in 1988.

Usually the \\"prophecy\\" is claimed to be Hopi or Cree. However, this \\"prophecy\\" is not Native American at all, but rather from a 1962 Evangelical Christian religious tract, titled Warriors of the Rainbow by William Willoya and Vinson Brown from Naturegraph Publishers.Interview with Michael Niman Brown is the founder and owner of Naturegraph Publishers.About Naturegraph > The roots of that myth go back to a book called Warriors of the Rainbow. It > was basically an evangelical Christian tract which was published in 1962. If > anything, it was an attack on Native culture. It was an attempt to > evangelize within the Native American community. Origins The modern story has been misrepresented as ancient prophecy. While this falsification may have been done consciously by the creators of the story, those who pass the story on may sincerely believe the story is authentic. This phenomenon is an example of what scholar Michael I. Niman calls \\"fakelore.\\" While there are variations on the theme, especially as it has become popularized in Internet memes, the common thread in all versions of the story is that a time of crisis will come to the Earth, that people of many races will come together to save the planet, and it is always erroneously credited as being a Native American or First Nations prophecy: \\"It is said there will be a time when the trees are dying, blah, blah, blah. There will be a tribe of people who come and save the Earth and they will be called the Rainbows.\\" Some modern versions of the fictitious story specifically state that this new \\"tribe\\" will inherit the ways of the Native Americans, or that Native ways will die out to be replaced by the new ways of the \\"Rainbow\\" people.

Warriors of the Rainbow relates these fictitious \\"Indian\\" prophecies to the Second Coming of Christ and has been described as purveying \\"a covert anti- Semitism throughout, while evangelizing against traditional Native American spirituality.\\" The book The Greenpeace Story, states that Greenpeace co- founder Bob Hunter was given a copy of Warriors of the Rainbow by a wandering dulcimer maker in 1969 and he passed it around on the first expedition of the Don't Make a Wave Committee, the precursor of Greenpeace. The legend inspired the name of three Greenpeace ships, Rainbow Warrior, used in environmental protection protests as well as the name of the hippie group, the Rainbow Family. Native American author and poet Sherman Alexie has addressed this belief in the \\"inner Indian\\" and the ways \\"American whites have co-opted Indian culture,\\" notably in his poem, \\"How to Write the Great American Indian Novel\\": Response In 2015, a group of Native American academics and writers issued a statement against the Rainbow Family members who are \\"appropriating and practicing faux Native ceremonies and beliefs.

Wyllie produced a number of notable public works, such as the Straw Locomotive and the Paper Boat. Life Wyllie was born in Shettleston, in the east end of Glasgow, and grew up in Craigton, in the south-west of the city.Kids at Craigton Primary inspired by former pupil George Wyllie, Glasgow Live, 14 March 2017 He was educated at Bellahouston Academy and Allan Glen's School. He later resided in Gourock. He worked as a customs officer before taking up art. He described himself as a \\"scul?tor\\". Wyllie's Straw Locomotive consisted of a full size steam locomotive, constructed from straw, and suspended from the Finnieston Crane, by the River Clyde in Glasgow. The sculpture was built at the former locomotive works at Springburn, and suspended from the crane for several months during 1987, before being taken back to the Springburn site and ceremonially burnt. The 80-foot Paper Boat was exhibited at The Tramway in Glasgow and at other sites including a placement on the Hudson River in New York, for which visit it carried quotations from Adam Smith's The Theory of Moral Sentiments. Wyllie's Slap and Tickle Machine is in the collection of the People's Palace, Glasgow, and wind-up stainless steel palm trees and a sculptural bandstand featured in the caf√© of the Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum in Glasgow. George Wyllie was commissioned in the 1970s to build some French influenced sculptures including General Charles de Gaulle, one of the Eiffel Tower and smaller mustachioed & beret wearing French visages (used as coat hooks) that were dotted around the city's first wine bar, \\"La Bonne Auberge\\", in its original site (the basement of the now defunct Beacons Hotel at 7 Park Terrace). The following year Wyllie contributed a golden eagle made from old car bumpers which adorned the wall of Harvey's Diner, (it took six men to lift and secure it) and two stainless steel palm trees in Harvey's Cocktail Bar at 8 Park Terrace. A gramophone with a rather large fiberglass megaphone was also sited in the bar at Harvey's but is now on display (alongside the Tour d' Eiffel) in La Bonne Auberge located within the Holiday Inn, in Glasgow's theatreland. One of Wyllie's most famous creations, Charlie Parker & His Band, could be seen within Charlie Parker's Bar in Royal Exchange Square in the 1970s and 1980s, the set was up for sale and was meant to have been on display in a jazz museum. Wyllie's work can also be seen in the Clyde Clock (depicting a clock on running legs), outside Buchanan bus station and in the Monument to Maternity (depicting a huge nappy pin), on the site of the former Rottenrow Maternity Hospital. Collections: Glasgow Corporation Museum of Transport, Cheshire County Council, Glasgow Cathedral, St. John's Kirk, Perth, St. Mary's Hospital, Lanark, Mitchell Limited, Greenock, and public and private collections at home, USA and Sweden. Wyllie stood as a list candidate (Scottish Senior Citizens Unity Party) for the West of Scotland region in the 2007 Scottish Parliamentary Election. Wyllie was a president of the Society of Scottish Artists and provides an award for an imaginative work at their annual exhibition. Wyllie was awarded the MBE in the New Years Honours List 2005.

Miss Britain III is a racing power boat designed and built by Hubert Scott-Paine. In 1932, Scott-Paine asked Rolls-Royce for a 'R' engine which had powered the winning entrant in the 1931 Schneider Trophy. He planned to challenge Garfield 'Gar' Wood's Miss America X for the Harmsworth Trophy. No engine was then available so there the matter rested. In February 1933, with the success of his Power-Napier engine to which he had exclusive rights, Scott-Paine issued his challenge for the Harmsworth Trophy. Within less than ten weeks, he had designed and built Miss Britain III in conditions of great secrecy at his Hythe workshops. The result was revolutionary, with stringers of metal-reinforced wood and aluminium cladding, a single Napier Lion VIID engine, and a length of only . The attention to detail is evident in the thousands of duralumin countersunk screws with the slots all in line with the water or air flow. George Selman designed a new propellor after the existing designs proved unsatisfactory. Testing was carried out in great secrecy on Southampton Water in the early dawn. Hubert Scott-Paine after presenting Miss Britain III to the National Maritime Museum in 1951 The team sailed for America in August 1933 and the contest was held on the St. Clair River at Algonac, Michigan on 4 September. The contest was very closely fought, but Wood managed to win by a small margin, and Scott-Paine returned to Britain to a hero's welcome. Following a fire on board which was quickly put out and the boat repaired, a record breaking attempt was made on 16 November 1933 on Southampton Water by Scott-Paine and Gordon Thomas. Miss Britain III was taken to Venice in 1934 where Scott-Paine won both the Prince of Piedmont's Cup and the Count Volpi Trophy. In 1951 Scott-Paine presented Miss Britain III to the National Maritime Museum where it remains on view.

It was the home of Scarborough F.C., a defunct football club who last played in the English Conference North before they were dissolved on 20 June 2007 with debts of ¬£2.5 million.\\"Scarborough FC wound up after 128 years\\", Yorkshire Post, 20 June 2007 The venue was first opened in 1898, when Scarborough F.C. moved from playing at Scarborough Cricket Club. In 1988, under a sponsorship deal, the club sold the naming rights of the Athletic Ground to McCain Foods and, until its closure in 2007, the stadium was known as the McCain Stadium. The ground was the venue for twenty-four Scarborough fixtures, that had in excess of 6,000 spectators. The biggest attendance was in January 1938, vs Luton Town in the FA Cup, the crowd recorded was 11,162. The stadium hosted games between Scarborough FC and illustrious names such as Arsenal, Chelsea (twice), Portsmouth, Southampton (twice), Bolton Wanderers, Middlesbrough, Coventry City, Crystal Palace, Brighton and Hove Albion & Bradford City in cup ties, whilst also entertaining local rivals York City and Hull City more often in league fixtures. Scarboroughs' first game in the Football League vs Wolverhampton Wanderers, attended by a crowd of 7,314 on 15 August 1987, was marred by crowd trouble. Scarborough played Red Star Belgrade in a friendly at the stadium in July 1990, which Red Star won 4‚Äì2. Red Star subsequently won the European Cup the following season. The arena had dual usage in the 1991‚Äì92, when the Scarborough Pirates (Rugby League) played at the ground, only four games had crowds in excess of 1,000. Baseball was another sport played at the ground for a single season in 1936, the 'Scarborough Seagulls' attracted crowds of up to 1,500 people. The stadium also hosted a floodlit cricket match in September 1980, when a Brian Close XI defeated Scarborough by 26 runs, in front of a 2,000 crowd. Scarborough RUFC played its home games at the stadium, during the clubs' inaugural season of 1926‚Äì27. 1000+ attendances at matches persuaded the club to move away from the ground after just one season to the Old Showground, and ultimately Silver Royd, Scalby. The Rugby club still played the occasional 'Hospital Shield' match at the Athletic Ground and also their 1951 Silver Jubilee game, which attracted a crowd of 1,800. Demolition of the stadium began in September 2011 and was completed in November 2011. The gates at the entrance to the ground are to be preserved and incorporated into a new sports village complex to serve as a lasting reminder of the former Athletic Ground/McCain Stadium. A Lidl supermarket was built on the site and opened 16 February 2017. Layout The gates at the entrance to the old stadium.The ground had four main stands: ;Main Stand The Main Stand ran along one side of the pitch. It was an old grandstand-style stand and was all seater. The former Shed end ;The Shed (Also known as \\"The Cow Shed\\") The Shed ran along the other side of the pitch and was covered terracing. This was the most popular part of the ground and was usually where the singing supporters stood. ;The East Stand The East Stand was behind one of the goals and was an all seater stand in which the seats were red and the letters SFC were spelled out in white seats. This was the newest part of the ground along with The West Stand. ;The West Stand The West Stand was identical to The East Stand but was behind the other goal. It was where the away fans were located. ;Corners In three of the four corners of the ground there was uncovered terracing although the north-west corner had become overrun with grass and weeds so was not normally used. The other corner of the ground was two-step terracing in front of the social club. ;Shops and Food In the north-east corner of the ground there was a social club, known as the McCain Lounge, and a club shop which was located in a hut. There was also a programme shop, food outlet and coffee hut. 2006 plans In March 2006 the plan was for a new stadium to be completed well before the start of the 2007‚Äì08 season. The stadium was to be located in Eastfield, Scarborough. The planned capacity was around 4,000 and the amount of land that the club would own was of which some would have been used for the stadium, with room for expansion, and the rest used to lease to offices etc. that would cover the club's operating losses. The McCain Stadium was to be sold to property developers (Persimmon Homes) for around ¬£4.1 million and this would have been enough to pay off all of the club's debts and fund the new stadium. Demise of Scarborough FC A covenant existed on the McCain Stadium that restricted its use only to sporting activities. Scarborough F.C. failed to convince the Scarborough Borough Council that its proposals to sell the McCain Stadium to a housing developer would raise enough money to both to pay off the debts and build a new ground.\\"Boro begin hunt for new home\\" , The Press, 22 June 2007 On Tuesday 12 June, Scarborough F.C. were given an eight-day 'stay of execution' following a 'change of heart' by their local Borough Council.

For example, a suitably equipped laptop might be able to use both a high speed wireless LAN and a cellular technology for Internet access. Wireless LAN connections generally provide higher speeds, while cellular technologies generally provide more ubiquitous coverage. Thus the laptop user might want to use a wireless LAN connection whenever one is available, and to 'fall over' to a cellular connection when the wireless LAN is unavailable. Vertical handovers refer to the automatic fallover from one technology to another in order to maintain communication. This is different from a 'horizontal handover' between different wireless access points that use the same technology in that a vertical handover involves changing the data link layer technology used to access the network. Vertical handoffs between WLAN and UMTS (WCDMA) have attracted a great deal of attention in all the research areas of the 4G wireless network, due to the benefit of utilizing the higher bandwidth and lower cost of WLAN as well as better mobility support and larger coverage of UMTS. Vertical handovers among a range of wired and wireless access technologies including WiMAX can be achieved using Media independent handover which is standardized as IEEE 802.21. Related issues Dual mode card To support vertical handover, a mobile terminal needs to have a dual mode card, for example one that can work under both WLAN and UMTS frequency bands and modulation schemes. Interworking architecture For the vertical handover between UMTS and WLAN, there are two main interworking architecture: tight coupling and loose coupling. The tight coupling scheme, which 3GPP adopted, introduces two more elements: WAG (Wireless Access Gateway) and PDG (Packet Data Gateway). So the data transfers from WLAN AP to a Corresponding Node on the internet must go through the Core Network of UMTS. Loose coupling is more used when the WLAN is not operated by cellular operator but any private user. So the data transmitted through WLAN will not go through Cellular Networks. Handover metrics In traditional handovers, such as a handover between cellular networks, the handover decision is based mainly on RSS (Received Signal Strength) in the border region of two cells, and may also be based on call drop rate, etc. for resource management reasons. In vertical handover, the situation is more complex. Two different kinds of wireless networks normally have incomparable signal strength metrics, for example, WLAN compared to UMTS. In, WLAN and UMTS networks both cover an area at the same time. The handover metrics in this situation should include RSS, user preference, network conditions, application types, cost etc. Handover decision algorithm Based on the handover metrics mentioned above, the decision about how and when to switch the interface to which network will be made. Many papers have given reasonable flow charts based on the better service and lower cost, etc. while some others, using fuzzy logic, neuron network or MADM methods to solve the problem. Mobility management When a mobile station transfers a user's session from one network to another, the IP address will change. In order to allow the Corresponding Node that the MS is communicating with to find it correctly and allow the session to continue, Mobility Management is used. The Mobility Management problem can be solved in different layers, such as the Application Layer, Transport Layer, IP Layer, etc. The most common method is to use SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) and Mobile IP. Handoff procedure The handover procedure specifies the control signalling used to perform the handover and is invoked by the handover decision algorithm.

The event is funded by local radio station FM 104.7, and the display is synchronised to a soundtrack of music broadcast on the station. History of the event The first Skyfire was held on 18 March 1989, as FM 104.7's contribution to the Canberra Festival that year. Around 60,000 people attended the second Skyfire on 11 March 1990, which was put on at a cost of around $100,000. On 10 March 1991, Skyfire III saw more than 2.5 tonnes of fireworks launched into the sky for Canberra's viewing pleasure. In 1992, Skirefire was held on 8 March. It featured three tonnes of pyrotechnics and lasted for 35 minutes. Skyfire Mark V, on 7 March 1993, featured 436 separate shots, coordinated to music by artists including Madonna, Midnight Oil and Prince. The show used more than five tonnes of fireworks, launched from 10 pontoons floating in the middle of the lake. In 1994, Skyfire was held on 13 March and featured six tonnes of aerial and water fireworks worth almost $250,000. Skyfire X, on 8 March 1998, attracted an estimated 120,000 visitors. Skyfire XI, held on 7 March 1999, had grown to attract an estimated 180,000 visitors. The 2006 Skyfire was held on 4 March, and called \\"Skyfire 18\\" because it was the eighteenth year of the fireworks. The day has become a large event with other activities including a display by the Roulettes aerobatic squadron and a performance by Lee Harding. There were around 35,000 individual fireworks used, with approximately 6,000 shooting comets and almost 3,000 shells. More than 170,000 visitors turned out to see Skyfire 19 in 2007. Skyfire 21 was held on 21 March 2009, with fireworks commencing at 8.33pm and lasting for 21 minutes. The firing zone was down the center basin of Lake Burley Griffin up to Anzac Parade and Parliament House down to Regatta Point. Fortunato Foti and a band of pyrotechnicians from Foti International Fireworks provided the show which was \\"at least 30 per cent bigger than the previous years,\\" with \\"over 3,000 aerial fireworks, 15 to 20,000 shooting comets\\". One barge shot off a few more fireworks for 5‚Äì10 minutes after the show completed. On 19 March 2011 around 80,000 people attended Skyfire. That year over 30 youths were taken into custody by police for underage drinking at the event. The following year, 130 police were employed to patrol Skyfire, and youth reception stations were set up at the event. The 2012 event featured more than 2500 aerial fireworks. Skyfire 25 in 2013 featured displays by the Royal Australian Navy, the Federation Guard and the Snowy Hydro Rescue Helicopter. Skyfire in 2014 utilised around 3000 individual cues and approximately eight kilometres of cabling. Skyfire was canceled for the first time in 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic. What's Happening This Year Hit 104.7 Skyfire 2018 will feature 40,000 pyrotechnic effects, 2,500 shells and 25,000 shooting comets. The firework display will start at 8:30pm with events at Regatta Point starting at 6:00pm including music, federation guard displays and a RAAF fast jet handling display.

In it, Hodgson never describes in any remarkable details the ghosts ‚Äì if this is indeed what they are, since their true nature is left ambiguous ‚Äì he merely reports on their gradual commandeering of the ship. Story The novel is presented as the transcribed testimony of Jessop, who we ultimately discover is the only survivor of the final voyage of the Mortzestus, having been rescued from drowning by the crew of the passing Sangier. It begins with Jessop's recounting how he came to be aboard the ill- fated Mortzestus and the rumors surrounding the vessel. Jessop then begins to recount the unusual events that rapidly increase in both frequency and severity. In the telling of his tale, Jessop offers only sparse interpretation of the events, spending most of the time relating the story in an almost journalistic fashion, presenting a relatively unvarnished description of the events and conversations as they occurred. He describes his confusion and uncertainty about what he believes he has seen, at times fearing for his own sanity. He eventually hears other members of the crew speak of strange events, most of which the rest of the crew pass off as either bad luck or the result of the witness being either tired or \\"dotty\\". Jessop only offers brief personal interpretation; he states that while he cannot discount the idea that the beings plaguing the ship may be ghosts, he presents his theory that they may be beings from another dimension that, while sharing the same physical space as theirs, are normally completely separated to the extent that neither dimension is aware of the existence of the other. He offers only vague, superficial suggestions as to the cause of his theorized dimensional breach. Style The seafaring jargon, coupled with the phonetically rendered dialects of some of the crew, make the text at times somewhat opaque, while at the same time lending it an air of authenticity and believability. Through the use of compactly written prose and simple, almost offhand foreshadowing, Hodgson gradually increases the suspense and sense of dread. Added to this is the fact that the beings invading the ship are neither described in any detail nor explained as to their origin or motive. The combination of these literary devices allows Hodgson to amplify the feeling of impending doom until the moment of the novel's unavoidable climax, when the \\"sea-devils\\", as Lovecraft describes them, pull the Mortzestus beneath the waves.  Reception  The economic style of writing has led horror writer Robert Weinberg to describe The Ghost Pirates as \\"one of the finest examples of the tightly written novel ever published.\\" Robert Weinberg,\\"What You Are Meant To Know:Twenty-One Horror Classics\\" in Mort Castle (ed.),On Writing Horror: A Handbook. Cincinnati, Ohio : Writer's Digest Books, 2007 (p.20). H.P. Lovecraft commented \\"The Ghost Pirates . . . is a powerful account of a doomed and haunted ship on its last voyage, and of the terrible sea-devils (of quasi-human aspect, and perhaps the spirits of bygone buccaneers) that besiege it and finally drag it down to an unknown fate. With its command of maritime knowledge, and its clever selection of hints and incidents suggestive of latent horrors in nature, this book at times reaches enviable peaks of power.\\" Notes External links * * Category:1909 British novels Category:Horror novels Category:Novels by William Hope Hodgson Category:Pirate books ","title":"The Ghost Pirates"},{"id":"4272834","text":"Folk-pop is a musical style that may be 1) contemporary folk songs with large, sweeping pop arrangements, or 2) pop songs with intimate, acoustic-based folk arrangements.

These materials are often referred to as Business Support Material (or \\"BSM\\"). BSM are promoted to a captive market represented by fellow IBOs (\\"Independent Business Owners\\") as well as potential IBOs, creating an opportunity for an additional and independent source of income to that derived from bonus payments arising from the sales generated within the network.

After their son Eric was born with severe birth defects they rapidly built one of the largest Amway businesses in North America. In the late 1980s and early 90s Amway began to expand and the Dornans decided there was an opportunity to develop a support system to work with Amway internationally.,. In 1990 they founded Network 21 with a goal to build a business system \\"that ignores borders and languages\\". Initially based in the US and Australia, Network 21 expanded rapidly in Eastern Europe, China, Indonesia, Turkey, PhilippinesNetwork 21 Starts Today, Manila Standard,19 Sep 1997, p.18 and later India.

The complaint also focused on recruitment tactics that inflate income estimates for new salespeople.

Early life Willett was educated at Winchester and Christ Church, Oxford. He went on to the Manchester College of Art and Dance, and then to Vienna, where he studied music (Willett played the cello) and stage design. Willett began his career as a theatre designer. However, this career was cut short by World War II. He served in Intelligence and the Eighth Army, in North Africa and Italy. After being demobilised, Willett worked first for the Manchester Guardian from 1948 to 1951, and then in 1960 he became the deputy to Arthur Crook, the editor of The Times Literary Supplement. Willett remained there until 1967. That year Methuen published his Art in a City, the result of his study into art in Liverpool, commissioned by the city's Bluecoat Society of Arts. A pioneering sociological study of art in a single city, it was republished in 2007 by the Bluecoat and Liverpool University Press, with a new introduction by the Bluecoat's artistic director Bryan Biggs that set Willett's prescient study in the context of Liverpool's cultural renaissance on the eve of its year as 2008 European Capital of Culture. Later life Willett became a freelance writer, an editor and translator, a theatre director and a visiting professor and lecturer. He was respected in academic circles for his patient work and careful research in translation, especially in German culture and politics. Famous relatives include Chris Martin of Coldplay and William Willett. Brecht Willett's love of Brecht began in the 1930s. Willett first studied Brecht's theatre design work. After the war, Willett became friends with Brecht himself, although it is said that the friendship got off to a bad start due to a disagreement about the Hitler- Stalin pact, but got back on track after they discovered that they were both interested in Tacitus. Willett worked on English translations for many of Brecht's plays, including: *Life of Galileo *The Good Person of Setzuan *The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui *Mother Courage and Her Children Bibliography * Willett, John. 1967.

It is believed to be a branch of Bektashi (Bekta≈üiyye) tariqat. Baba Samit, according to a legend was the son of Haji Bektash Veli, the founder of the movement. Also according to the tomb inscirptions, he descends from Imam Ali Reza. History of Baba Samit movement in Azerbaijan is quite poorly researched. It is known that Bektashi movement was widespread in Azerbaijan by the 16th century. After Safavi takeover of Azerbaijan, this Shia order was promoted by the authorities. Significant number of Sufi tekkes were operational during XVI-19th centuries. The tomb of Baba Samid near Sabirabad, Azerbaijan is still revered by population, however as a result of Soviet-era neglect, both research of Sufi tariqats and knowledge of their traditions are weak to non-existent. The Baba Samid Mausoleum is a tomb located on the outskirts of the highway in the Shikhlar village of Sabirabad District. Professor of History Institute of Azerbaijan, doctor of historical sciences Meshadykhanim Nematova investigated the history of the tomb and repeatedly published his thoughts on it.In the 9 lines of the 1st and 3rd lines of the Arabic-Persian language of the Baba Samid tomb, surah XIX, 31-32 ayat written from Quran. The lines 4-5 are devoted to ƒ∞mam Ali's definition, and in the remaining 4 lines, the Safavid shah (king) of the Tomb of Tahmasp I was commissioned by Abdulla Khan Ustajli, the Shirvan governor in 993, during the Hijri year (XI-1585 ) is written as \\"were built for the leader of sayyids of the source of happiness (on here sayyid is \\"great\\"), the head of Baba Samid bin Bektash bin Sultan Ali ibn Hazrati Musa Arriza\\",As it is seen from the book, Baba Samid is the son of Haji Bektash.

Dhanapala is also a distinguished member of Constitutional Council (Sri Lanka) and he is the Senior Special Advisor on Foreign Relations to President Maithripala Sirisena, and was Sri Lanka's official candidate for the post of Secretary-General of the United Nations, before withdrawing from the race on 29 September 2006. From 2007 he has been the President of the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs. Early years in Sri Lanka Dhanapala was born in Sri Lanka on 30 December 1938. His family hails from the town of Matale. Dhanapala was educated at prestigious Trinity College in Kandy. He gained a reputation as an all rounder as a schoolboy and was awarded the Ryde Gold Medal in 1956. At the age of 17 Jayantha Dhanapala won a contest with an essay titled \\"The World We Want\\" and travelled to the US where he met Senator John F. Kennedy and President Dwight D. Eisenhower. Diplomatic career He entered the Sri Lankan diplomatic service and served in London, Beijing, Washington, D.C., New Delhi and Geneva. Dhanapala was appointed Ambassador in Geneva (1984‚Äì87)--he was also accredited to the UN and was appointed Sri Lanka's Ambassador to the United States of America based in Washington D.C. from 1995-97. Dhanapala was widely acclaimed for his Presidency of the 1995 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Review and Extension Conference, a landmark event in disarmament history, because of his crafting of a package of decisions balancing the twin objectives of nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament and the concerns of the nuclear weapon states and the non-nuclear weapon states which was adopted without a vote. The New York Times observed that Jayantha Dhanapala 'was a diplomat mostly unknown outside the arms-control world until he was elected to preside over this conference.' Under-Secretary-General at the UN Dhanapala was hand picked by UN Secretary-General, Kofi Annan to take on the challenging job of Under Secretary General to re-establish the Department of Disarmament after the UN reforms of 1997 (1998‚Äì2003). During his tenure he piloted the UN role in arresting the proliferation of small arms and light weapons, anti-personnel landmines, conventional weapons, and weapons of mass destruction while reinforcing existing norms and norm-building in other areas such as missiles. He also broke new ground both in-house in taking managerial initiatives in gender mainstreaming and in work-life issues, as well as in the disarmament field by innovating the exchange of weapons for a development programme in Albania and other areas, and also in the cross-sectoral linking of disarmament with development, the environment and peace education programmes. Dhanapala was appointed Secretary-General of the Secretariat for Coordinating the Peace Process (SCOPP) in Sri Lanka from 2004 - 2005. He was also Senior Special Advisor to both Presidents Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga and Mahinda Rajapakse during the period 2005-2007.

Significant weather disturbances, specifically tropical cyclones, that enter or develop in the PAR are given Philippine-specific names.  Boundary  The area is bounded by six points namely:  * This area encompasses almost all of the land territory of the Philippines, except for the southernmost portions of the province of Tawi-Tawi, and some of the country's claimed islands in the Spratlys. The area also includes the main island of Palau, most of Taiwan, as well as portions of the Malaysian state of Sabah and the Japanese prefecture of Okinawa.  Function  The establishing decree of PAGASA mandates the weather agency to monitor weather occurrences occurring within the PAR. Tropical cyclones are only assigned local names by PAGASA when they enter or develop within the PAR. These names are provided in parallel with internationally recognized names designated by the Japan Meteorological Agency. The rationale for providing local names is that it is felt that Filipinos will respond more to familiar names and that it helps to underscore that these named weather disturbances pose a direct threat to the country. Furthermore, PAGASA provide names earlier when a low pressure area becomes a tropical depression, in contrast to international names that are only issued when a tropical cyclone reaches tropical storm strength (65 km/h and higher), due to the fact that tropical depressions can still cause flooding and other damage. When a named weather disturbance within the PAR has made or is expected to make a landfall in the Philippines, PAGASA is mandated to issue Severe Weather Bulletins (SWB) every three to six hours. If the weather disturbance is not affecting land, the weather agency has to issue SWBs every 12 hours.  Other areas forecasting domains  The three domains (in the Northwest Pacific Basin) of the PAGASA for their monitoring of tropical cyclone activity: PAR (gray broken lines), TCAD (red), and TCID (yellow) Aside from the PAR, PAGASA forecasters have two other areas of responsibilities for tropical cyclone monitoring: the Tropical Cyclone Advisory Domain (TCAD) and the Tropical Cyclone Information Domain (TCID). Together with the PAR, these three areas of the Northwest Pacific Basin are collectively called domains. Since most tropical cyclones come from the broad expanse of ocean east of the country, the eastern boundaries of the PAR, TCAD and TCID are farther from the archipelago than the western boundaries. The TCAD, considered to be the \\"middle domain,\\" is located between the PAR and the TCID. TCAD tropical cyclones are too far to have any direct effect to the country but are close enough for monitoring by the PAGASA and prompts the agency to issue a Tropical Cyclone Advisory (a less serious form of tropical cyclone bulletin than the SWB). The TCAD includes the area bounded by the imaginary lines connecting the coordinates: , , , . Note that though the TCAD completely encloses the PAR, it does not include the area within the PAR. On the other hand, the TCID is the largest and the outermost domain of PAGASA. TCID tropical cyclones are of least concern for PAGASA but are still necessary enough for monitoring and public awareness. The TCID is the area enclosed by the imaginary lines connecting the coordinates: , , , . Similarly, the TCID excludes the area enclosed by the PAR and the TCAD.

The band initially drew influence from US and British hardcore punk bands such as Discharge and The Exploited, and then adopted a straightforward thrash metal sound. They have been recognised as pioneers of the British thrash metal scene, and have been referred to as one of the country's so-called \\"big four\\", along with Sabbat, Xentrix and Acid Reign. To date, Onslaught have released seven studio albums, one compilation, four singles and two live recordings: a live album and a live DVD. Singer Sy Keeler at the Rockharz festival 2016 in Germany History Origins and Power from Hell (1982‚Äì1985) Onslaught were formed in 1982 in Bristol, England by guitarist Nige Rockett and drummer Steve Grice. The two musicians were working to forge an ultra-aggressive, speed metal sound that was becoming more and more popular in the days of early Slayer and Metallica. In 1985, the duo were joined by bass player Jase Stallard and vocalist Paul Mahoney. The quartet quickly worked up enough material for a record and later that year, the debut Power from Hell was recorded and released on U.K. independent record label Cor. The band started to write more heavy metal‚Äìoriented songs than their original punk sound. This was mainly influenced by the early releases of thrash metal bands, albeit with a darker sound. The band signed to Children of the Revolution Records, and released their debut album, Power from Hell, in 1985Huey, Steve: Power from Hell ‚Äì Onslaught, Allmusic, accessed on 2 May 2013. as a result. As with other metal bands of the time, the lyrics were often Satanic, and the cover showed a demon emerging from a pentagram. The Force, In Search of Sanity and breakup (1985‚Äì1991) Jase Stallard (who had joined Onslaught in 1984) retained his place in the band, but took over bass duties from hired bassist, who in turn assumed the role of rhythm guitarist, giving the band a second guitarist.Anderson, Jason: [ Onslaught], Allmusic, accessed on 2 May 2013. During the first months of 1986, the new line-up was ready to record their second album, The Force, in a recording studio in London. The album was released in the spring of that year through the label Under One Flag, and Onslaught toured for about two-and-a-half years in support of it, playing with bands such as Mot√∂rhead, Exciter, Girlschool, Kreator, Nuclear Assault, Agent Steel, the Crumbsuckers, Angel Dust, Exumer, Messiah, Sabbat and a then-still unknown Anthrax. The album was much more successful than Power from Hell, and is considered a classic by many critics and fanzines. Chris Dahlkvist left the band later in 1986 and was replaced by James Hinder. In 1987, Jase Stallard's guitar playing came into question, so Nige dismissed him and replaced him with Rob Trotman. Using this line-up, they set out to write material for a third studio album. Having drawn the attention of London Records, the label signed the band. In mid-1988, the band began to start recording their third album, In Search of Sanity. Upon hearing the album, the record label felt that a more versatile vocalist was needed to do the music more justice. Although the band felt that Sy Keeler's vocals on the demo recording had the right sound, the production had a more polished sound ‚Äì hence the need for a more polished vocalist. Steve Grimmett, formerly of NWOBHM act Grim Reaper, was drafted in to replace the departing Sy Keeler.Rivadavia, Eduardo: In Search of Sanity ‚Äì Onslaught, Allmusic, accessed on 2 May 2013. Owing to this development, the release of the album was delayed until the summer of 1989. Following the success of The Force, and with an accomplished new singer, there was much pre-release publicity. In Search of Sanity had a much different sound than previous Onslaught releases, and many hardcore thrash metal fans were disappointed, and this partially contributed to the band's demise. Despite the mixed critical reaction, this is Onslaught's only album to enter the UK charts, peaking at #46, while the cover version of AC/DC's \\"Let There Be Rock\\" was the band's only single to chart there, reaching at #50. Onslaught toured for over a year in support of In Search of Sanity, playing with the likes of Annihilator, Xentrix, Slammer, the Crumbsuckers, Horse (not to be confused with the metalcore band from California), Drunken State, Sabbat and Dead On. In early 1990, Steve Grimmett decided to leave the band due to personal reasons and was replaced by Tony O'Hora. The band then set out to write and then record a fourth album. London Records decided not to renew their contract with Onslaught, leaving the band without a record deal. Roadrunner offered them ¬£50,000 but Nige declined to sign for an indie label and they decided to disband in early 1991. Tony O'Hora later sung for Praying Mantis and is the singer of Sweet today.

They were joined by the Welsh guitarist Alan Jordan. Writing for the band's fourth album, Killing Peace, began in 2005, and the album was released in early 2007. Bassist James Hinder left the band in 2006, before the release of Killing Peace, and was replaced by Jeff Williams. This line-up recorded a live DVD in Club Stodola, Warsaw, Poland, which was released in 2007 by Metal Mind Productions under the title Live Polish Assault. In 2008, Jordan left the band and was replaced by guitarist Andy Rosser-Davies. In November of that year, the band recorded their live performance at the Damnation Festival in Leeds resulting in a live album (Dual Disc CD / DVD), Live Damnation; mixed by Andy Sneap, it was released in August 2009 by Candlelight Records.Live Damnation ‚Äì Onslaught : Releases, Allmusic, accessed on 2 May 2013.

On 25 March 2011, Steve Grice decided to leave the band on the eve of a major European tour. Michael Hourihan (Extreme Noise Terror / Desecration) replaced him for the tour and in November 2011 became a full member of the band. Onslaught recorded their sixth studio album, VI, from April to May and released it on 20 September 2013.

However, the band stated that Andy Rosser Davies was going to contribute to the songwriting of their next album. On 27 March 2018, guitarist Iain GT Davies and drummer Mic Hourihan parted ways with Onslaught to focus on other bands and projects. Nige Rockett said that their replacements had already been chosen, but had not yet been revealed. He then said that the band would perform a new song from their then-upcoming seventh album at Bloodstock Open Air. On 16 July 2018, it was announced that guitarist Wayne Dorman and Drummer James Perry had joined the band.

He was twice Soviet champion, in 1934 (jointly with Ilya Rabinovich) and 1937. In 1937 he drew a match against future world champion Mikhail Botvinnik. In 1950 Levenfish was among the first recipients of the title of Grandmaster, awarded by FIDE that year for the first time. Early life and education Levenfish was born in Piotrk√≥w, Poland, then part of the Russian Empire, to Jacob Levenfish and Golda Levenfish (n√©e Finkelstein). He spent most of his formative years in St. Petersburg, where he attended Saint Petersburg State Institute of Technology and studied chemical engineering. Early chess achievements His earliest recognition as a prominent chess player came when he won the St. Petersburg championship of 1909, and played in the strong Carlsbad tournament of 1911, where he scored 11¬Ω points from 25 games. At age 22, this was to be his first and last tournament outside Russia or the Soviet Union. His play at the time was compared to that of Mikhail Chigorin. In the next decade, he won the Leningrad Championships of 1922, 1924, and 1925 (jointly). Soviet Championship At a national level, he finished on the podium at the Soviet Championship on four occasions; third in 1920, second in 1923, co-champion at Leningrad in 1934 (tied with Ilya Rabinovich at 12/19), and outright champion at Tbilisi in 1937 with a score of 12¬Ω/19 points. Levenfish (left) takes on Botvinnik in their 1937 match. In the Moscow International tournament of 1935, he scored 10¬Ω/19 points to tie for 6th‚Äì7th places, as Mikhail Botvinnik and Salo Flohr won. In a Soviet-only tournament at Leningrad 1936, he was third with 8¬Ω/14. Participation in the Leningrad‚ÄìMoscow training tournament of 1939 resulted in a shared 3rd‚Äì6th- place finish, with a score of 10/17, behind winner Flohr and Samuel Reshevsky.Event Details: Leningrad/Moscow, 1939, Chessmetrics.com In match play, he drew with Botvinnik in 1937 over 13 games, and beat Vladimir Alatortsev in 1940. Lack of support and recognition Despite his successes, Levenfish was virtually ignored by the Soviet chess authorities, who gave their full blessing to the young rising star and committed communist Botvinnik. He was the only strong Soviet master of his generation who was denied a stipend. This meant that he could only afford a poorly heated room in a run-down block of flats. Furthermore, the government refused him permission to travel abroad and compete in tournaments such as AVRO 1938 (even though he was the reigning Soviet Champion). This further weakened his standing and most likely affected his morale, as well as his development as a chess player. Other players born before the revolution, such as Alexander Alekhine, Efim Bogoljubov, and Akiba Rubinstein were all allowed to travel and even ended up living abroad. Deprived of the same opportunities, Levenfish played only within the confines of Soviet Russia and supplemented his income with a job as an engineer in the glass industry. This eventually resulted in a slow retirement from active play. Levenfish was awarded the title of International Grandmaster by FIDE, the world chess federation, in 1950, the year the title was introduced officially. Legacy Genna Sosonko, in his book Russian Silhouettes, echoes the thoughts of some grandmasters who knew him, and they speak of a man of integrity and independence, who never complained about his difficult living conditions. Boris Spassky encountered him in a Moscow subway, just days before his death. Levenfish, who had a wretched look, was clutching a handkerchief to his mouth and declared that he had just had six teeth extracted. Vasily Smyslov recounts the time that Levenfish visited him, towards the end of his life, armed with a huge pile of papers. It turned out to be a manuscript detailing his lifetime work on rook endgames. He asked Smyslov to check for errors, and some minor corrections later, the book was published (1957) bearing both names, under the title Teoriya ladeynykh okonchaniy (\\"The theory of rook endings\\"), later published in English in 1971 under the title Rook Endings. Smyslov freely admits that all of the hard work was carried out by his co-author. In his time, Levenfish also wrote books for beginners and edited a collaborative effort on chess openings, titled Sovremenny debyut (\\"Modern openings\\"). His posthumously published autobiography, Izbrannye partii i vospominaniya (1967), contained 79 annotated games. Regarding his playing abilities, Sosonko points to his deep understanding of the game and a keen eye for brilliantly imaginative moves. He was also an opening theorist; the Levenfish Attack, a variation of the Sicilian Defence, is named after him.  Playing style  Levenfish defeated virtually all of the top Russian and Soviet players from the 1910s to the early 1950s, and beat world champions Alexander Alekhine and Emanuel Lasker as well. However, he was bested by young superstars Paul Keres and David Bronstein. Levenfish was strong on the Black side of the French Defence and the Slav Defence, and generally preferred classical openings such as Ruy Lopez and Queen's Gambit, although he did from time to time toy with the hypermodern Gr√ºnfeld Defence and Nimzo-Indian Defence.

Today it serves as a convention and exposition centre for the G√∂ttingen State and University Library. History In 1294 the Dominican Order was permitted to settle in G√∂ttingen and started to build a monastery in the western part of the city center. The minster was constructed in the style of a gothic hall church typical for the order. Upon completion of the minster the Paulinerkirche became the most ancient gothic hall church in the historic center of G√∂ttingen. It was dedicated in 1331 to the apostles Peter and Paul. This is the origin of the name of the church. Since 1341 it has been the repository of important relics of saint Thomas Aquinas. These drew great numbers of pilgrims to Thomasmass every year and provided the church with a good reputation even in distant places. Twelve years after Martin Luther's publication of the 95 Theses, Reformation took hold in G√∂ttingen in 1529. This resulted in hardships for the black friars in the subsequent years. The city magistrate in the beginning did not have full administrative control over the parish churches. These were under the authority of duke Eric I of Brunswick-L√ºneburg, prince of Calenberg-G√∂ttingen. He stayed faithful to the old beliefs and did not want to permit Lutheran sermons in his churches. The city magistrate therefore decided the mendicant order's masses would be delivered in the two churches. The largest one of these was the Paulinerkirche, so most of these masses were delivered primarily here. The first regular mass was given by reverend Friedrich H√ºventhal against the wishes of the monks on October 24, 1529. Also, in this place the first children in G√∂ttingen were baptized to the Lutheran faith. (rather baptized \\"according to Lutheran practice.\\" No one is baptized into a denominational faith.) Kollegienhaus Library hall in Paulinerkirche (ca 1820) Shortly afterwards the monastery was dissolved, and the building was then used as a paedagogium for educational purposes. This later lead to the establishment of G√∂ttingen University in this building in 1737. A short time before this, the foundation of the university library of G√∂ttingen took place. Masses for the students and academics continued in the church until 1803. The rapidly growing library resulted in a shortage of available space, so the masses had to move to another place and the library took over all parts of the building. In 1812, under the rule of J√©r√¥me Bonaparte, king of Westphalia, the lower windows were taken down and an additional floor was integrated. The upper part of the church was converted to a library hall. The church suffered heavy damage in an Allied air raid on November 24, 1944. After World War II the church was rebuilt and the library hall was opened as a lecture hall. Later it was used for the central catalogue of Lower Saxony. Today, since the 1993 opening of the Central Library of the G√∂ttingen State and University Library on campus, the lecture and exhibition hall covers the entire length of the former church. The monumental hall building, with a length of 52 meters, meets all requirements for modern use, yet retains its ancient character. In spite of several renovations of the church building, it is still almost completely unadorned, inside as well as outside. In the lecture and exhibition hall there are long rows of bookshelves holding some of the books which formed the base for the library in the 18th century. The Paulinerkirche today is part of a building complex of the G√∂ttingen State and University Library at the site of the former monastery precinct. The stock of books printed after 1900 has been stored since 1992 in the Central Library on campus. However, in the Gr√ºnderzeit style building adjacent to the Paulinerkirche remain the manuscript as well as rare and old prints reading rooms, the map collection, the Heyne Hall as well as several storage rooms. The Kollegienhaus (college house) is located between this building and the Paulinerkirche which was constructed as a baroque building between 1734 and 1737 from material of the old monastery. In this building on Papendiek street is the one of the two main entrances to the library as well as to the lecture and exhibition hall in the Paulinerkirche on the first floor. In front of the building is a bronze statue of important G√∂ttingen professor Georg Christoph Lichtenberg.

The town is north of Melbourne. At the , Romsey had a population of 4,412. History The original location for the settlement known as Five Mile Creek was approximately north of the present township. The restored Royal Mail Hotel still stands on this site although it is now a private residence. The Post Office opened on 16 January 1858, in the Royal Mail Hotel (then the Drovers and Carriers Arms), but was named Lancefield until 19 January 1860 and Five Mile Creek until March 1860. The Post Office was moved closer to the centre of the present township in 1864. The area was serviced by three local newspapers. The former Romsey station was a significant stopping point on the now dismantled Clarkefield-Lancefield railway between 1881 and 1956. The Romsey Court of Petty Sessions closed on 1 January 1967, with the former courthouse subsequently sold to the Country Fire Authority. Today Romsey has a skate park, one petrol station [Caltex], banks, one IGA supermarket, a fresh produce store, a chemist, several medical centres, a dentist, a (closed) pub and a primary school. The local Lions Park is built around Five Mile Creek, a small creek running through the town. After extensive renovations were carried out in the historic Shire of Romsey Council Chambers building and the old Romsey Post Office building, a public library operates in the former Council Chambers building, which opened in 2008, whilst the old post office building operates as part of the Romsey Service Centre for the local government. Romsey is a growing community which has multiple major projects going on. The major one is an all abilities park space that is being developed.

Butler that incorporates time travel and is modeled on slave narratives. First published in 1979, it is still widely popular. It has been frequently chosen as a text for community- wide reading programs and book organizations, as well as being a common choice for high school and college courses. The book is the first-person account of a young African-American woman writer, Dana, who finds herself being shunted in time between her Los Angeles, California home in 1976 and a pre-Civil War Maryland plantation. There she meets her ancestors: a proud black freewoman and a white planter who has forced her into slavery and concubinage. As Dana's stays in the past become longer, the young woman becomes intimately entangled with the plantation community. She makes hard choices to survive slavery and to ensure her return to her own time. Kindred explores the dynamics and dilemmas of antebellum slavery from the sensibility of a late 20th-century black woman, who is aware of its legacy in contemporary American society. Through the two interracial couples who form the emotional core of the story, the novel also explores the intersection of power, gender, and race issues, and speculates on the prospects of future egalitarianism. While most of Butler's work is classified as science fiction, Kindred is considered to cross genre boundaries. It has been classified also as literature or African- American literature. Butler has categorized the work as \\"a kind of grim fantasy.\\" Plot Kindred scholars have noted that the novel's chapter headings suggest something \\"elemental, apocalyptic, archetypal about the events in the narrative,\\" thus giving the impression that the main characters are participating in matters greater than their personal experiences.Kubitschek, Missy D. \\"'What Would a Writer Be Doing Working out of a Slave Market?': Kindred as Paradigm, Kindred in Its Own Write.\\" Claiming the Heritage: African-American Women Novelists and History. Jackson, MS: UP of Mississippi, 1991. 24-51. Prologue Dana wakes up in the hospital with her arm amputated. Police deputies question her about the circumstances surrounding the loss of her arm and ask her whether her husband Kevin, a white man, beats her. Dana tells them that it was an accident and that Kevin is not to blame. When Kevin visits her, they are both afraid of telling the truth because they know nobody would believe them. The River Their predicament began on June 9, 1976, the day of her twenty-sixth birthday. The day before, she and Kevin had moved into a house a few miles away from their old apartment in Los Angeles. While unpacking, Dana suddenly becomes dizzy, and her surroundings begin to fade away. When she comes to her senses, she finds herself at the edge of a wood, near a river where a small, red- haired boy is drowning. Dana wades in after him, drags him to the shore, and tries to resuscitate him. The boy's mother, who had been unable to save him, begins screaming and hitting Dana, accusing her of killing her son, whom she identifies as Rufus. A man arrives and points a gun at Dana, terrifying her. She becomes dizzy again and arrives back at her new house with Kevin beside her. Kevin, shocked at her disappearance and reappearance, tries to understand if the whole episode was real or a hallucination. The Fire Dana managed to wash off the filth from the river before the dizziness sets in once again. This time, she is whisked back to a bedroom where a red-haired boy has set his bedroom drapes aflame. The boy turns out to be Rufus, now a few years older. Dana quickly puts out the fire and speaks to Rufus, who, unafraid, confesses he set fire to the drapes to get back at his father for beating him after he stole a dollar. During their ensuing conversation, Rufus's casual use of the word \\"nigger\\" to refer to Dana, who is black, initially upsets Dana, but then leads her to figure out that she has been transported back in time as well as space, specifically to Maryland, circa 1815. Following Rufus's advice, Dana seeks refuge at the home of Alice Greenwood and her mother, free blacks who live on the edge of the plantation. Dana realizes that both Rufus and Alice are her ancestors, and will one day have children. At the Greenwoods', she witnesses a group of young white men smash down the door, drag out Alice's father, who is a slave, and whip him brutally for being there without papers. One of the men punches Alice's mother when she refuses his advances. The men leave, Dana comes out of hiding, and helps Alice's mother, only to be confronted by one of the white men, who hits her and attempts to rape her. Fearing for her life, Dana becomes dizzy and returns to 1976. Though hours have passed for her, Kevin assures her that she has been gone only for a few minutes. The next day, Kevin and Dana prepare for the possibility that she may travel back in time again by packing a survival bag for her and by doing some research on black history from the books in their home library. The Fall In a flashback, Dana recounts how she met Kevin while doing minimum-wage temporary jobs at an auto-parts warehouse. Kevin becomes interested in Dana when he learns she is a writer like him, and she befriends him even though he is white and their coworkers judge their relationship. They find they have much in common; both are orphans, both love to write, and both their families disapproved of their aspiration to become writers. They become lovers. As Kevin is leaving for the library to find out how to forge \\"free papers\\" for Dana, she feels the dizziness coming back. This time, Kevin holds on to her and also travels to the past. They find Rufus writhing in pain from a broken leg. Next to him is a black boy named Nigel, whom they send to the main house for help. Rufus reacts with violent disbelief when he finds out that Kevin and Dana are married: whites and blacks are not allowed to marry in his time. Dana and Kevin explain to Rufus that they are from the future and prove it by showing the dates stamped on the coins Kevin carries in his pockets. Rufus promises to keep their identities a secret, and Dana tells Kevin to pretend that he is her owner. When Tom Weylin arrives with his slave Luke to retrieve Rufus, Kevin introduces himself. Weylin grudgingly invites him to dinner. Once back in the Weylin plantation, Margaret, Rufus's mother, fusses about her son's well-being and, jealous of the attention Rufus shows Dana, sends Dana to the cookhouse. There, Dana meets two house slaves: Sarah, the cook; and Carrie, her mute daughter. Unsure as to what their next act should be, Kevin accepts Weylin's offer to become Rufus's tutor. Kevin and Dana stay on the plantation for several weeks. They observe the relentless cruelty and torture that Weylin, Margaret, and the spoiled Rufus use against the slaves. While none is actually sadistic or evil, they feel entitled to treat the slaves as property. Weylin catches Dana reading and whips her mercilessly. The dizziness overcomes her before Kevin can reach her and she travels back to 1976 alone. The Fight In a flashback, Dana remembers how she and Kevin were married. Both of their families opposed the marriage due to ethnic bias. While Kevin's reactionary sister is prejudiced against African Americans, Dana's uncle abhors the idea of a white man eventually inheriting his property. Only Dana's aunt favors the union, as it would mean that her niece's children would have lighter skin. Kevin and Dana marry without any family present. After eight days of being home recuperating without Kevin, Dana time travels to find Rufus getting beaten up by Alice Greenwood's husband, the slave Isaac Jackson. Dana learns that Rufus had attempted to rape Alice, once his childhood friend. Dana convinces Isaac not to kill Rufus, and Alice and Isaac run away while Dana gets Rufus home. She learns that it has been five years since her last visit and that Kevin has left Maryland. Dana nurses Rufus back to health in return for his help delivering letters to Kevin. Five days later, Alice and Isaac are caught. Isaac is mutilated and sold to traders heading to Mississippi. Alice is beaten, savaged by dogs, and enslaved as punishment for helping Isaac escape. Rufus, who claims to love Alice, buys her, and orders Dana to nurse her back to health. Dana does so with much care. When Alice finally recovers, she curses Dana for not letting her die, and is wracked with grief for her lost husband. Rufus orders Dana to convince Alice to sleep with him now that she has recovered. Dana speaks with Alice, outlining her three choices: she can refuse and be whipped and raped; she can acquiesce and be raped without being beaten; or she can try again to run away. Injured and terrified from her previous punishment, Alice gives in to Rufus's desire and becomes his concubine. While in his bedroom, Alice finds out that Rufus did not send Dana's letters to Kevin, and tells Dana. Furious that Rufus lied to her, Dana runs away to find Kevin, but is betrayed by a jealous slave, Liza. Rufus and Weylin capture her and Weylin whips her brutally. When Weylin learns that Rufus failed to keep his promise to Dana to send her letters, he writes to Kevin and tells him that Dana is on the plantation. Kevin comes to retrieve Dana, but Rufus stops them on the road and threatens to shoot them. He tells Dana that she can't leave him again. The dizziness overcomes Dana and she travels back to 1976, this time with Kevin. The Storm Dana's and Kevin's happy reunion is short-lived, as Kevin has a hard time adjusting to the present after living in the past for five years. He shares a few details of his life in the past with Dana: he witnessed terrible atrocities against slaves, traveled farther up north, worked as a teacher, helped slaves escape, and grew a beard to disguise himself from a lynch mob. Disconcerted about his trouble in re-entering his former world, he grows angry and cold. Deciding to let him work his feelings out for himself, Dana packs a bag in case she time travels again. Soon enough she finds herself outside the Weylin plantation house in a rainstorm, with a very drunk Rufus lying face down in a puddle. She tries to drag him back to the house, then gets Nigel to help her carry him. Back at the house, an aged Weylin appoints Dana to nurse Rufus back to health under threat of her life. Suspecting Rufus has malaria and knowing she cannot help much, Dana feeds Rufus the aspirin she has packed to lower his fever. Rufus survives, but remains weak for weeks. Dana learns that Rufus and Alice have had three mixed-race children of the plantation and that only one, a boy named Joe, has survived. Alice is pregnant again. Rufus had forced Alice to let the doctor bleed the other two when they had fallen ill, a customary treatment of the time, but it killed them. Weylin has a heart attack and, when Dana is unable to save his life, Rufus sends her to work in the corn fields as punishment. By the time he repents his decision, she has collapsed from exhaustion and is being whipped by the overseer. Rufus appoints Dana as the caretaker of his ailing mother, Margaret. Now the master of the plantation, Rufus sells off some slaves, including Tess, Weylin's former concubine. Dana expresses her anger about that sale, and Rufus explains that his father left debts he must pay. He convinces Dana to use her writing talent to stave off his other creditors. Dana abhors secretarial work, and had argued with Kevin about his asking her to type his manuscripts. Time passes and Alice gives birth to a girl, Hagar, a direct ancestor of Dana. Alice confides that she plans to run away with her children as soon as possible, as she fears that she is forgetting to hate Rufus. Dana convinces Rufus to let her teach his son Joe and some of the slave children how to read. However, when a slave named Sam asks Dana if his younger siblings can join in on the lessons, Rufus sells him away as punishment for flirting with her. When Dana tries to interfere, Rufus hits her. Faced with her own powerlessness over Rufus, she retrieves the knife she has brought from home and slits her wrists in an effort to time travel. The Rope Dana awakens back at home with her wrists bandaged and Kevin by her side. She tells him of her eight months in the plantation, of Hagar's birth, and of the need to keep Rufus alive, as the slaves would be separated and sold if he died. When Kevin asks if Rufus has raped Dana, she responds that he has not, that a rape attempt would be the act that would cause her to kill him, despite the possible consequences. Fifteen days later, on the 4th of July, Dana returns to the plantation where she finds that Alice has hanged herself. Alice attempted to run away after Dana disappeared, and as punishment Rufus whipped her and told her that he had sold her children. In reality, he had sent to them to stay with his aunt in Baltimore. Racked with guilt about Alice's death, Rufus nearly commits suicide. After Alice's funeral, Dana uses that guilt to convince Rufus to free his children by Alice. From that moment on, Rufus keeps Dana at his side almost constantly, having her share meals and teach his children. One day, he finally admits that he wants Dana to replace Alice in his life. He says that unlike Alice, who, despite growing used to Rufus, never stopped plotting to escape him, Dana will see that he is a fair master and eventually stop hating him. Dana, horrified at the thought of forgiving Rufus in this way, flees to the attic to find her knife. Rufus follows her there, and when he attempts to rape her, Dana stabs him twice with her knife. Nigel arrives to see Rufus's death throes, at which point Dana becomes terribly sick and time travels home for the last time, only to find herself in excruciating pain, as her arm has been joined to a wall in the spot where Rufus was holding it. Epilogue Dana and Kevin travel to Baltimore to investigate the fate of the Weylin plantation after the death of Rufus, but they find very little; a newspaper notice reporting Rufus's death as a result of his house catching fire, and a Slave Sale announcement listing all the Weylin slaves except Nigel, Carrie, Joe, and Hagar. Dana speculates that Nigel covered up the murder by starting the fire, and feels responsible for the sale of the slaves. To that, Kevin responds that she cannot do anything about the past, and now that Rufus is finally dead, they can return to their peaceful life together.  Characters  * Edana (Dana) Franklin: A courageous and compassionate twenty-six-year-old African-American woman writer. She is the protagonist and the narrator of the story. She is married to a white writer named Kevin. She is forced to travel to a slave plantation in antebellum Maryland by her white slave-owning ancestor Rufus. On the plantation, she must learn to make hard compromises to survive as a slave and to ensure her existence in her own time. As a writer, she is largely unsuccessful until marrying Kevin. * Rufus Weylin: The red- haired, white son of Tom Weylin, a Maryland plantation and slave owner. Dana first meets him as a young accident-prone boy torn between an indulgent mother and a strict father and sees him grow to replace Tom Weylin as slave master. He is as needy as his mother, but possessive and controlling like his father. His arrogance and greediness leads to him to rape and impregnate his longtime friend Alice (Dana's great-great-great-grandmother), making him Dana's ancestor. He desperately seeks validation through Alice and Dana's love, but still views them as his property. * Kevin Franklin: Dana's husband, a white writer twelve years older than Dana. Kevin is a progressive person who is deeply in love with his wife, having rejected his racist family in order to marry her. When he time travels with Dana to the past on one of her trips, he witnesses the brutality of slavery and eventually becomes an abolitionist, helping slaves escape to freedom. Still, he often has trouble internalizing the incredible racism that he witnesses. * Tom Weylin: The merciless and brutal slave owner of an antebellum Maryland plantation. Tom's cold, strict, and impatient personality makes him a hard master and father. When he perceives he has been disobeyed, he retaliates swiftly and violently; instilling fear in those subservient to him. He whips Dana on multiple occasions, and authorizes the selling of his slaves' children. He is often likened to Kevin in looks. * Alice Greenwood (later, Alice Jackson): A proud black woman, born free and then enslaved for helping her slave husband Isaac to run away. Alice is subsequently bought by Rufus, who forces her to become his concubine and bear him four children, though only two survive, Joe and Hagar. A tragic figure, she survives her fate by feeding off the hate she has for Rufus but hangs herself after Rufus tells her he has sold her children as punishment for trying to run away. * Sarah: The cook of the Weylin household and its unofficial manager, she works hard and makes the house slaves work hard, but also saves food for them and tries to protect them. Dana's first impression of Sarah as a \\"mammy\\" changes when she learns Weylin has sold all of Sarah's children except Carrie. Sarah's outward compliance masks her anger, resentment, and suffering. * Margaret Weylin: The plantation owner's temperamental wife. She is over-indulgent and possessive of Rufus. Like her husband, she is abusive to the house slaves. She goes away for a long period of time when her infant twins die and returns much mellower due to an opium addiction. She is hated by the slaves, especially by Sarah. Sarah explains that Margaret sold her babies in order to get new furniture. * Hagar Weylin: Rufus and Alice's youngest daughter. Hagar is Dana's direct blood line on her mother's side. Without Hagar being born, Dana believes she would not exist. * Luke: A slave at the Weylin plantation and Nigel's father. Luke works as Weylin's overseer until Weylin sells him for not being sufficiently obedient. * Nigel: The son of Luke and a slave at the Weylin Plantation. As a small boy, he is also Rufus's playmate. Dana secretly teaches him to read and write. When older, he runs away unsuccessfully; when back on the plantation, he forms a family with Sarah's daughter, Carrie. * Carrie: Sarah's daughter and Nigel's wife. Although Carrie is mute, she is a source of strength for Dana by helping her come to terms with the hard compromises she must make for the sake of survival. * Liza: A slave woman jealous of Dana's preferential treatment by the Weylins, she snitches on Dana when she runs away, causing her to get caught and whipped. * Tess: A slave woman at the Weylin plantation used as a sexual slave by Tom Weylin and later by Edwards, the white overseer. * Jake Edwards: One of the overseers of the Weylin plantation.  Main themes   Realistic depiction of slavery and slave communities  Kindred was written to explore how a modern black woman would experience the time of a slavery society, where most black people were considered as property; a world where \\"all of society was arrayed against you.\\"\\"If All 2003: A Conversation with Octavia Butler.\\" WAB.

Concluding that \\"there probably is no more vivid depiction of life on an Eastern Shore plantation than that found in Kindred,\\" Sandra Y. Govan traces how Butler's book follows the classic patterns of the slave narrative genre: loss of innocence, harsh punishment, strategies of resistance, life in the slave quarters, struggle for education, experience of sexual abuse, realization of white religious hypocrisy, and attempts to escape, with ultimate success.Govan, Sandra Y. \\"Homage to Tradition: Octavia Butler Renovates the Historical Novel.\\" MELUS 13.1-2 (Spring-Summer 1986): 79-96. JSTOR. Web. 27 Jan. 2014. Robert Crossley notes how Butler's intense first-person narration deliberately echoes the ex-slave memoirs, thereby giving the story \\"a degree of authenticity and seriousness.\\" Lisa Yaszek sees Dana's visceral first-hand account as a deliberate criticism of earlier commercialized depictions of slavery, such as the book and film Gone with the Wind, produced largely by whites, and even the television miniseries Roots, based on a book by African-American writer Alex Haley.Yaszek, Lisa. \\"'A Grim Fantasy': Remaking American History in Octavia Butler's Kindred.\\" Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society 28.4 (Summer 2003): 1053-1066. JSTOR. Web. 27 Jan. 2014. In Kindred, Butler portrays individual slaves as distinctive people, giving each his or her own story. Robert Crossley argues that Butler treats the blackness of her characters as \\"a matter of course\\", to resist the tendency of white writers to incorporate African Americans into their narratives just to illustrate a problem or to divorce themselves from charges of racism. Thus, in Kindred the slave community is depicted as a \\"rich human society\\": the proud yet victimized freewoman-turned-slave Alice; Sam the field slave, who hopes Dana will teach his brother; the traitorous sewing woman Liza, who frustrates Dana's escape; the bright and resourceful Nigel, Rufus's childhood friend who learns to read from a stolen primer; most importantly, Sarah the cook, who Butler transforms from an image of the submissive, happy \\"mammie\\" of white fiction to a deeply angry yet caring woman subdued only by the threat of losing her last child, the mute Carrie.In Kindred, by Octavia Butler.

Master-slave power dynamics  Scholars have argued that Kindred complicates the usual representations of chattel slavery as an oppressive system where the master regards the slave as a mere tool/economic resource to be bred or sold. Pamela Bedore notes that while Rufus seems to hold all the power in his relationship with Alice, she never wholly surrenders to him. Alice's suicide can be read as her way of ending her struggle with Rufus with a \\"final upsetting of their power balance\\", an escape through death.Bedore, Pamela. \\"Kindred.\\" Masterplots, 4th Edition (2010): 1-3. MagillOnLiterature Plus. Web. 9 Feb. 2014. By placing Kindred in comparison to other Butler novels such as Dawn, Bedore explores the bond between Dana and Rufus as re-envisioning slavery as a \\"symbiotic\\" interaction between slave and master: since neither character can exist without the other's help and guidance, they are continually forced to collaborate in order to survive. The master does not simply control the slave but depends on her.Bedore, Pamela. \\"Slavery and Symbiosis in Octavia Butler's Kindred.\\", Foundation: The International Review of Science Fiction 31.84 (Spring 2002): 73-81. From the side of the slave, Lisa Yaszek notices conflicting emotions: in addition to fear and contempt, there is affection from familiarity and the occasional kindnesses of the master. A slave who collaborates with the master to survive is not reduced to a \\"traitor to her race\\" or to a \\"victim of fate.\\" Kindred portrays the exploitation of black female sexuality as a main site of the historic struggle between master and slave. Diana Paulin describes Rufus's attempts to control Alice's sexuality as a means to recapture power he lost when she chose Isaac as her sexual partner.Paulin, Diana R. \\"De-Essentializing Interracial Representations: Black and White Border-Crossings in Spike Lee's Jungle Fever and Octavia Butler's Kindred.\\" Cultural Critique 36 (Spring 1997): 165-193. JSTOR. 11 Feb. 2014. Compelled to submit her body to Rufus, Alice divorces her desire from her sexuality to preserve a sense of self. Similarly, Dana's time traveling reconstructs her sexuality to fit the times. While in the present, Dana chooses her husband and enjoys sex with him; in the past, her status as a black female forced her to subordinate her body to the desires of the master for pleasure, breeding, and as sexual property.Mitchell, Angelyn. \\"Not Enough of the Past: Feminist Revisions of Slavery in Octavia E. Butler's Kindred.\\" MELUS 26.3 (Autumn 2001): 51-75. JSTOR. Web. 16 Apr. 2014. Thus, as Rufus grows into adulthood, he attempts to control Dana's sexuality, ending with his attempt at rape to turn her into a replacement of Alice. Since Dana sees sexual domination as the ultimate form of subordination, her killing of Rufus is the way she rejects the role of female slave, distinguishing herself from those who did not have the power to say \\"no.\\"Vint, Sherryl. \\"'Only by Experience': Embodiment and the Limitations of Realism in Neo-Slave Narratives.\\" Science Fiction Studies 34.2 (Jul. 2007): 241-261. JSTOR. Web. 27 Jan. 2014.  Critique of American history  Scholarship on Kindred often touches on its critique of the official history of the formation of the United States as an erasure of the raw facts of slavery. Lisa Yaszek places Kindred as emanating from two decades of heated discussion over what constituted American history, with a series of scholars pursuing the study of African- American historical sources to create \\"more inclusive models of memory.\\" Missy Dehn Kubitschek argues that Butler set the story during the bicentennial of the adoption of the Declaration of Independence of the United States to suggest that the nation should review its history in order to resolve its current racial strife. Robert Crossley believes that Butler dates Dana's final trip to her Los Angeles home on the Bicentennial to connect the personal with the social and the political. The power of this national holiday to erase the grim reality of slavery is negated by Dana's living understanding of American history, which makes all her previous knowledge of slavery through mass media and books inadequate.In Kindred, by Octavia Butler. Boston: Beacon, 2004. 276. Yaszek further notes that Dana throws away all her history books about African-American history on one of the trips back to her California home, as she finds them to be inaccurate in portraying slavery. Instead, Dana reads books about the Holocaust and finds these books to be closer to her experiences as a slave. In several interviews, Butler has mentioned that she wrote Kindred to counteract stereotypical conceptions of the submissiveness of slaves. While studying at Pasadena City College, Butler heard a young man from the Black Power Movement express his contempt for older generations of African-Americans for what he considered their shameful submission to white power. Butler realized the young man did not have enough context to understand the necessity to accept abuse just to keep oneself and one's family alive and well. Thus, Butler resolved to create a modern African-American character, who would go back in time to see how well he (Butler's protagonist was originally male) could withstand the abuses his ancestors had suffered.Butler, Octavia. \\"An Interview with Octavia E. Butler.\\" Charles H. Rowell. Callaloo 20.1 (1997): 47-66. JSTOR. Web. 23 Apr. 2014. Therefore, Dana's memories of her enslavement, as Ashraf A. Rushdy explains, become a record of the \\"unwritten history\\" of African-Americans, a \\"recovery of a coherent story explaining Dana's various losses.\\" By living these memories, Dana is enabled to make the connections between slavery and current social situations, including the exploitation of blue-collar workers, police violence, rape, domestic abuse, and segregation.Rushdy, Ashraf. \\"Families of Orphans: Relation and Disrelation in Octavia Butler's Kindred.\\" College English. 55.2 (Feb. 1993): 135-157. JSTOR. 23 October 2012.  Trauma and its connection to historical memory (or historical amnesia)  Kindred reveals the repressed trauma slavery caused in America's collective memory of history. In an interview on 1985, Butler suggested that this trauma partly comes from attempts to forget America's dark past: \\"I think most people don‚Äôt know or don‚Äôt realize that at least 10 million blacks were killed just on the way to this country, just during the middle passage....They don‚Äôt really want to hear it partly because it makes whites feel guilty.\\"Butler, Octavia. \\"Black Scholar Interview with Octavia Butler: Black Women and the Science Fiction Genre.\\" Frances M. Beal. Black Scholar (Mar/Apr. 1986): 14-18. Print. In a later interview with Randall Kenan, Butler explained how debilitating this trauma has been for Americans, especially for African Americans, as symbolized by the loss of her protagonist's left arm: \\"I couldn‚Äôt really let [Dana] come all the way back. I couldn‚Äôt let her return to what she was, I couldn‚Äôt let her come back whole and [losing her arm], I think, really symbolizes her not coming back whole. Antebellum slavery didn‚Äôt leave people quite whole.\\" Many academics have extended Dana's loss as a metaphor for the \\"lasting damage of slavery on the African American psyche\\" McEntee, Grace. \\"Kindred.\\" African American Women: An Encyclopedia of Literature by and about Women of Color. Volume 2: K-Z. Ed. Elizabeth Ann Beaulieu. Westport, CT: Greenwood, 2006. 524. to include other meanings: Pamela Bedore, for example, reads it as the loss of Dana's na√Øvete regarding the supposed progress of racial relations in the present. For Ashraf Rushdy, Dana's missing arm is the price she must pay for her attempt to change history. Robert Crossley quotes Ruth Salvaggio as inferring that the amputation of Dana's left arm is a distinct \\"birthmark\\" that represents a part of a \\"disfigured heritage.\\"In Kindred, by Octavia Butler. Boston: Beacon, 2004. 267. Scholars have also noted the importance of Kevin's forehead scar, with Diana R. Paulin arguing that it symbolizes Kevin's changing understanding of racial realities, which constitute \\"a painful and intellectual experience.\\"  Race as social construct  The construction of the concept of \\"race\\" and its connections to slavery are central themes in Butler's novel. Mark Bould and Sherryl Vint place Kindred as a key science fiction literary text of the 1960s and 1970s black consciousness period, noting that Butler uses the time travel trope to underscore the perpetuation of past racial discrimination into the present and, perhaps, the future of America.Bould, Mark and Sherryl Vint \\"New Voices, New Concerns: The 1960s and 1970s.\\" The Routledge Concise History of Science Fiction. New York: Routledge, 2011. The lesson of Dana's trips to the past, then, is that \\"we cannot escape or repress our racist history but instead must confront it and thereby reduce its power to pull us back, unthinkingly, to earlier modes of consciousness and interaction.\\" The novel's focus on how the system of slavery shapes its central characters dramatizes society's power to construct raced identities. The reader witnesses the development of Rufus from a relatively decent boy allied to Dana to a \\"complete racist\\" who attempts to rape her as an adult.Davis, Jane. \\"Kindred.\\" Masterplots II: African American Literature, Revised Edition (2008): 1-3. MagillOnLiteraturePlus. Web. 9 Feb. 2014. Similarly, Dana and Kevin's prolonged stay in the past reframes their modern attitudes.Hood, Yolanda and Robin Anne Reid. \\"Intersections of Race and Gender.\\" Women in Science Fiction and Fantasy, Volume 1. Ed. Robin Anne Reid. Westport, CT and London: Greenwood, 2009. 46-48. Print. Butler's depiction of her principal character as an independent, self-possessed, educated African-American woman defies slavery's racist and sexist objectification of black people and women. Kindred also challenges the fixity of \\"race\\" through the interracial relationships that form its emotional core. Dana's kinship to Rufus disproves America's erroneous concepts of racial purity. It also represents the \\"inseparability\\" of whites and blacks in America. The negative reactions of characters in the past and the present to Dana and Kevin's integrated relationship highlight the continuing hostility of both white and black communities to interracial mixing. At the same time, the relationship of Dana and Kevin extends to concept of \\"community\\" from people related by ethnicity to people related by shared experience. In these new communities whites and black people may acknowledge their common racist past and learn to live together. The depiction of Dana's white husband, Kevin, also serves to examine the concept of racial and gender privilege. In the present, Kevin seems unconscious of the benefits he derives from his skin pigmentation as well as of the way his actions serve to disenfranchise Dana. Once he goes to the past, however, he must not just resist accepting slavery as the normal state of affairs, but dissociate himself from the unrestricted power white males enjoy as their privilege. His prolonged stay in the past transforms him from a naive white man oblivious about racial issues into an anti-slave activist fighting racial oppression.  Strong female protagonist  In her article \\"Feminisms,\\" Jane Donawerth describes Kindred as a product of more than two decades of recovery of women's history and literature that began in the 1970s. The republication of a significant number of slave narratives, as well as the work of Angela Davis, which highlighted the heroic resistance of the black female slave, introduced science fiction writers such as Octavia Butler and Suzy McKee Charnas to a literary form that redefined the heroism of the protagonist as endurance, survival, and escape.Donawerth, Jane. \\"Feminisms: Recovering Women's History.\\" The Routledge Companion to Science Fiction. Ed. Mark Bould et al. London and New York: Routledge, 2009. 218-219. As Lisa Yaszek points further, many of these African-American woman's neo-slave narratives, including Kindred, discard the lone male hero in favor of a female hero immersed in family and community. Robert Crossley sees Butler's novel as an extension of the slave woman's memoir's exemplified by texts such as Harriet Ann Jacobs' Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl, especially in its portrayal of the compromises the heroine must make, the endurance she must have, and her ultimate resistance to victimization.In Kindred, by Octavia Butler. Boston: Beacon, 2004. 278-279. Originally, Butler intended for the protagonist of Kindred to be a man, but as she explained in her interview, she could not do so because a man would immediately be \\"perceived as dangerous\\": \\"[s]o many things that he did would have been likely to get him killed. He wouldn't even have time to learn the rules...of submission.\\" She then realized that sexism could work in favor of a female protagonist, \\"who might be equally dangerous\\" but \\"would not be perceived so.\\" Most scholars see Dana as an example of a strong female protagonist. Angelyn Mitchell describes Dana as a black woman \\"strengthened by her racial pride, her personal responsibility, her free will, and her self- determination.\\" Identifying Dana as one of many Butler's strong female black heroes, Grace McEntee explains how Dana attempts to transform Rufus into a caring individual despite her struggles with a white patriarchy. These struggles, Missy Dehn Kubitschek explains, are clearly represented by Dana's resistance to white male control of a crucial aspect of her identity‚Äîher writing‚Äîboth in the past and in the present. Sherryl Vint argues that, by refusing Dana to be reduced to a raped body, Butler would seem to be aligning her protagonist with \\"the sentimental heroines who would rather die than submit to rape\\" and thus \\"allows Dana to avoid a crucial aspect of the reality of female enslavement.\\" However, by risking death by killing Rufus, Dana becomes a permanent surviving record of the mutilation of her black ancestors, both through her armless body and by becoming \\"the body who writes Kindred.\\" In contrast to these views, Beverly Friend believes Dana represents the helplessness of modern woman and that Kindred demonstrates that women have been and continue to be victims in a world run by men.Friend, Beverly. \\"Time Travel as a Feminist Didactic in Works by Phyllis Eisenstein, Marlys Millhiser, and Octavia Butler.\\" Extrapolation: A Journal of Science Fiction and Fantasy 23.1 (1982): 50-55. Print.  Female quest for emancipation  Some scholars consider Kindred as part of Butler's larger project to empower black women. Robert Crossley sees Butler' science fictional narratives as generating a \\"black feminist aesthetic\\" that speaks not only to the sociopolitical \\"truths\\" of the African-American experience, but specifically to the female experience, as Butler focuses on \\"women who lack power and suffer abuse but are committed to claiming power over their own lives and to exercising that power harshly when necessary.\\"In Kindred, by Octavia Butler. Boston: Beacon, 2004. 265-84. Given that Butler makes Dana go from liberty to bondage and back to liberty beginning on the day of her birthday, Angelyn Mitchell further views Kindred as a revision of the \\"female emancipatory narrative\\" exemplified by Harriet A. Jacobs's Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl, with Butler's story engaging in themes such as female sexuality, individualism, community, motherhood, and, most importantly, freedom in order to illustrate the types of female agency that are capable of resisting enslavement. Similarly, Missy Dehn Kubistchek reads Butler's novel as \\"African-American woman‚Äôs quest for understanding history and self\\" which ends with Dana extending the concept of \\"kindred\\" to include both her black and white her heritage as well as her white husband while \\"insisting on her right to self definition.\\"  The meaning of the novel's title  Kindred‚Äôs title has several meanings: at its most literal, it refers to the genealogical link between its modern-day protagonist, the slave-holding Weylins, and both the free and bonded Greenwoods; at its most universal, it points to the kinship of all Americans regardless of ethnic background.In Kindred, by Octavia Butler. Boston: Beacon, 2004. 280. Westfahl, Gary. \\"Kindred by Octavia E. Butler (1979).\\" The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy: Themes, Works, and Wonders. Vol. 3. Ed. Gary Westfahl. Westport, CT: Greenwood, 2005. 1120-1122. Since Butler‚Äôs novel challenges readers to come to terms with slavery and its legacy, one significant meaning of the term \\"kindred\\" is the United States‚Äô history of miscegenation and its denial by official discourses. This kinship of black people and whites must be acknowledged if America is to move into a better future. On the other hand, as Ashraf H. A. Rushdy contends, Dana's journey to the past serves to redefine her concept of kinship from blood ties to that of \\"spiritual kinship\\" with those she chooses as her family: the Weylin slaves and her white husband, Kevin. This sense of the term \\"kindred\\" as a community of choice is clear from Butler's first use of the word to indicate Dana and Kevin's similar interests and shared beliefs. Dana and Kevin's relationship, in particular, signals the way for black and white America to reconcile: they must face the country's racist past together so they can learn to co-exist as kindred. Genre Publishers and academics have had a hard time categorizing Kindred. In an interview with Randall Kenan, Butler stated that she considered Kindred \\"literally\\" as \\"fantasy.\\" According to Pamela Bedore, Butler's novel is difficult to classify because it includes both elements of the slave narrative and science fiction. Frances Smith Foster insists Kindred does not have one genre and is in fact a blend of \\"realistic science fiction, grim fantasy, neo-slave narrative, and initiation novel.\\"Foster, Frances S. \\"Kindred.\\" The Concise Oxford Companion to African American Literature. Ed. William L. Andrews, Frances Smith Foster, and Trudier Harris. Oxford: Oxford UP, 2001. Sherryl Vint describes the narrative as a fusion of the fantastical and the real, resulting in a book that is \\"partly historical novel, partly slave narrative, and partly the story of how a twentieth century black woman comes to terms with slavery as her own and her nation's past.\\" Critics who emphasize Kindred‚Äôs exploration of the grim realities of antebellum slavery tend to classify it mainly as a neo-slave narrative. Jane Donawerth traces Butler's novel to the recovery of slave narratives during the 1960s, a form then adapted by female science fiction writers to their own fantastical worlds. Robert Crossley identifies Kindred as \\"a distinctive contribution to the genre of neo-slave narrative\\" and places it along Margaret Walker‚Äôs Jubilee, David Bradley‚Äôs The Chaneysville Incident, Sherley Anne Williams‚Äôs Dessa Rose, Toni Morrison‚Äôs Beloved, and Charles R. Johnson‚Äôs Middle Passage.In Kindred, by Octavia Butler. Boston: Beacon, 2004. 265. Sandra Y. Govan calls the novel \\"a significant departure\\" from the science fiction narrative not only because it is connected to \\"anthropology and history via the historical novel,\\" but also because it links \\"directly to the black American slave experiences via the neo-slave narrative.\\" Noting that Dana begins the story as a free black woman who becomes enslaved, Marc Steinberg labels Kindred an \\"inverse slave narrative.\\"Steinberg, Marc. \\"Inverting History in Octavia Butler's Postmodern Slave Narrative.\\" African American Review 38.3 (2004): 467. JSTOR. Web. 23 Apr. 2014. Still, other scholars insist that Butler's background in science fiction is key to our understanding of what type of narrative Kindred is. Dana's time traveling, in particular, has caused critics to place Kindred along science fiction narratives that question \\"the nature of historical reality,\\" such as Kurt Vonnegut's \\"time-slip\\" novel Slaughterhouse FiveBooker, Keith, and Anne-Marie Thomas. \\"The Time-Travel Narrative.\\" The Science Fiction Handbook.

In her article \\"A Grim Fantasy,\\" Lisa Yaszek argues that Butler adapts two tropes of science fiction‚Äîtime-travel and the encounter with the alien Other‚Äîto \\"re-present African-American women‚Äôs histories.\\" Raffaella Baccolini further identifies Dana's time traveling as a modification of the \\"grandfather paradox\\" and notices Butler's use of another typical science fiction element: the narrative's lack of correlation between time passing in the past and time passing in the present.Baccolini, Raffaella. \\"Gender and Genre in the Feminist Critical Dystopias of Katharine Burdekind, Margaret Atwood, and Octavia Butler.\\" Future Females, The Next Generation: New Voices and Velocities in Feminist Science Fiction.

Style  Kindred ‚Äòs plot is non linear; rather, it begins in the middle of its end and contains several flashbacks that connect events in the present and past. In an interview, Butler acknowledged that she split the ending into a \\"Prologue\\" and an \\"Epilogue\\" so as to \\"involve the reader and make him or her ask a lot of questions\\" that could not be answered until the end of the story.Bogstad, Janice. \\"Octavia E. Butler and Power Relations.\\" Janus 4.4 (1978-79): 30. Missy Dehn Kubitschek sees this framing of Dana's adventures as Butler's way to highlight the significance of slavery to what Americans consider their contemporary identity. Because \\"Prologue\\" occurs before Dana travels in time and \\"Epilogue\\" concludes with a message on the necessity to confront the past, we experience the story as Dana's understanding of what we have yet to understand ourselves, while the \\"Epilogue\\" speaks about the importance of this understanding. Roslyn Nicole Smith proposes that Butler's framing of the story places Dana literally and figuratively in media res so as to take her out of that in media res; that is, to indicate Dana's movement from \\"a historically fragmented Black woman, who defines herself solely on her contemporary experiences\\" to \\"a historically integrated identity\\" who has knowledge of and a connection to her history.Smith, Roslyn Nicole. \\"Medias Res, Temporal Double-Consciousness and Resistance in Octavia Butler's Kindred.\\" (2007). English Theses. Paper 31 Kindred ‚Äôs story is further fragmented by Dana‚Äôs report of her time traveling, which uses flashbacks to connect the present to the past. Robert Crossley sees this \\"foreshortening\\" of the past and present as a \\"lesson in historical realities.\\"Crossley, Robert. \\"Critical Essay.\\" In Kindred, by Octavia Butler. Boston: Beacon, 2004. 279. Because the story is told from the first-person point of view of Dana, readers feel they are witnessing firsthand the cruelty and hardships that many slaves faced every day in the South and so identify with Dana's gut-wrenching reactions to the past.In Kindred, by Octavia Butler. Boston: Beacon, 2004. 274. This autobiographical voice, along with Dana's harrowing recollection of the brutality of slavery and her narrow escape from it, is one of the key elements that have made critics classify Kindred as a neo-slave narrative. Another strategy Butler uses to add dramatic interest to Kindred‚Äôs story is the deliberate delay of the description of Dana and Kevin‚Äôs ethnicities. Butler has stated in an interview she did not want to give their \\"race\\" away yet since it would have less of an impact and the reader would not react the way that she wanted them to.Mehaffy, M., and A. Keating. \\"'Radio Imagination': Octavia Butler on the Poetics of Narrative Embodiment.\\" MELUS 26.1 (2001): 51-52. Print. Dana's ethnicity becomes revealed in chapter two, \\"The Fire,\\" while Kevin's ethnicity becomes clear to the reader in chapter three, \\"The Fall,\\" which also includes the history of Dana's and Kevin's interracial relationship. Butler also uses Alice as Dana's doppelg√§nger to compare how their decisions are a reflection of their environment. According to Missy Dehn Kubitschek, each woman seems to see a reflection of herself in the other; each is the vision of what could be (could have been) the possible fate of the other given different circumstances. According to Bedore, Butler's use of repetition blurs the lines between the past and present relationships. As time goes on, Alice and Rufus‚Äô relationship begins to seem more like a miserable married couple while Dana and Kevin become somewhat distant.  Background  In several interviews, Octavia Butler has acknowledged that a series of family and life experiences influenced her novel Kindred. Butler's grandmother had worked chopping sugar cane; she also washed the laundry of her employers. Of course she also did her own housework and laundry for her family. Butler had felt ashamed as a child that her mother worked as a housemaid. She resented her mother for allowing her employers to treat her poorly; in her eyes she felt they talked to her mother as if she were less than a human being. Butler gradually realized that her mother endured all that in order to provide for her family. Butler created female characters in her writing ‚ÄîAlice, Sarah, and Dana‚Äîwho were heroic in their capacity for endurance and sacrifice in the face of exploitation.Fowler, Karen J. \\"Remembering Octavia Butler.\\" , Salon.com. 17 Mar. 2006. Web. 12 May 2014. Butler drew from her variety of jobs when creating Dana's world as a struggling writer -\\"from blue collar to low grade white collar, clerk typist\\". Butler also shows Dana in hard times baking a solitary potato for her daily meal and keeping at her writing, just as she did. Butler wrote Kindred specifically to respond to a young man involved in black consciousness raising. He felt ashamed of what he considered the subservience of older generations of African Americans, saying they were traitors and he wanted to kill them. Butler disagreed with this view. She believed that a historical context had to be given so that the lives of the older generations of African Americans could be understood as the silent, courageous resistance that it was, a means of survival. She decided to create a contemporary character and send her (originally it was a him) back to slavery, to explore how difficult a modern person would find it to survive in such harsh conditions. As Butler said in a 2004 interview with Allison Keyes, she \\"set out to make people feel history.\\" Butler's field research in Maryland also influenced her writing of Kindred. She traveled to the Eastern Shore to Talbot County where she wandered a bit. She also conducted research at the Enoch Pratt Free Library in Baltimore and the Maryland Historical Society. She toured Mount Vernon, the plantation home of America's first president, George Washington. At the time, guides referred to the slaves as \\"servants\\" and avoided referring to the estate as a former slave plantation. Butler also spent time reading slave narratives, including the autobiography of Fredrick Douglass, who escaped and became an abolitionist leader. She read many grim accounts, but decided she needed to moderate events in her book in order to attract enough readers. Reception Kindred is Butler's bestseller, with Beacon Press advertising it as \\"the classic novel that has sold more than 450,000 copies.\\" Among Butler's peers, the novel has been well received. Speculative writer Harlan Ellison has praised Kindred as \\"that rare magical artifact‚Ä¶ the novel one returns it to again and again\\", while writer Walter Mosley described the novel as \\"everything the literature of science fiction can be.\\"\\"About This Book: Kindred.\\" Random House Academic Resources.

Linell Smith of The Baltimore Sun describes it as \\"a celebrated mainstay of college courses in women's studies and black literature and culture.\\" Speaking at the occasion of Beacon Press' reissue of Kindred for its 25th Anniversary, African-American literature professor Roland L. Williams said that the novel has remained popular over the years because of its crossover appeal, which \\"continues to find a variety of audiences--fantasy, literary and historical\\" and because \\"it is an exceedingly well-written and compelling story‚Ä¶ that asks you to look back in time and at the present simultaneously.\\"Young, Earni. \\"Return of Kindred Spirits.\\" Rev. of Kindred, by Octavia Butler.

The battle, which was part of the Sixth Battle of the Isonzo, took place on a strategic area the westernmost edge of the Karst Plateau. The Italians, who conquered the lowland area around Monfalcone and Ronchi, tried to force themselves over the Karst Plateau in order to gain control over the main road linking the port city of Trieste to the town of Gorizia. After fierce fighting and huge casualties, they succeeded in their attempts. The Austro-Hungarian forces retreated and Gorizia fell to the Italians. They, however, didn't succeed in forcing their way to Trieste, and were stopped northwest of Duino.  Battle  Before the battle the Austro-Hungarians shifted forces from the Izonzo front to other parts of the war. The lack of Austrian soldiers at the region resulted in Italian general Luigi Cadorna deciding to attack the river.Fighting started on 6 August, when Italian forces under general Luigi Capello launched an attack on Austro-Hungarian positions guarding the main transport road leading from the coast town of Duino to Gorizia. The main objective of the attack was to secure the transport road, thus securing their advance to Gorizia from the south. A plan was drafted by Italian general Luigi Capello, to split the army in half, with one side attacking straight at Austrian positions and the other to attack from the rear. On the morning of 6 August, Austro-Hungarian artillery began shelling Italian infantry as they were drawing nearer. Following the devised plan, four divisions of Italian infantry launched a straight-on frontal assault on Austro-Hungarian trenches, resulting in many soldiers and officers being gunned down by heavy machine-gun fire. With reinforcements, the Italian infantry managed to penetrate through Austro-Hungarian lines, eventually taking the village Doberd√≤ itself. By now, Austrian forces were in desperate need for reinforcements to halt the Italian advance towards Gorizia. The other half of the Italian army attacked Austrian positions from the rear, as planned. Intensive hand-to-hand fighting commenced, with both sides taking massive losses. Surrounded, Austro-Hungarian forces were forced to retreat, on the line east of Gorizia, giving Italian forces control of the heavily damaged town.  Results  Both sides had taken massive losses, with an estimated of more than 20,000 soldiers killed or missing. Although victorious, Italian losses were high, with around 5,000 of their soldiers killed, due to frontal assaults on superior enemy defenses and the Austro-Hungarians' use of chemical weapons. Italian generals were eager to crush Austro-Hungarian forces in the area, with the intent of going as far as Ljubljana, while Austrian generals wanted to preserve their troops (having to fight on two fronts), which gave them fewer men to defend their borders with Italy and also Russia. In all, this was a strategically important victory for the Italians, despite the numerous losses on both sides. The Italian army gained territory around a front that stretched 20 kilomters.

The album is considered a milestone in Pepper's career.  Recording  According to Pepper, the album was recorded under enormous pressure, as he first learned of the recording session the morning he was due in the studio, and he had never met the other musicians, all of whom he greatly admired. He was playing on an instrument in a bad state of repair, and was suffering from a drug problem. Purportedly, Pepper had not played the saxophone for some time, either for two weeks (according to the liner notes), or six months (according to Pepper's autobiography Straight Life), although the discography in Straight Life indicates that Pepper had recorded many sessions in the previous weeks, including one five days earlier.

Biography  Born in Kagoshima to a kimono merchant, Kawasaki Sh≈çz≈ç became a tradesman at the age of 17 in Nagasaki, the only place in Japan then open to the West. He started a shipping business in Osaka at 27, which failed when his cargo ship sank during a storm. In 1869, he joined a company handling sugar from the Ryukyu Islands, established by a Kagoshima samurai, and in 1893, researched Ryukyu sugar and sea routes to the Ryukyus at the request of the Ministry of Finance. In 1894, he was appointed executive vice president of Japan Mail Steam-Powered Shipping Company, and succeeded in opening a sea route to the Ryukyu and transporting sugar to mainland Japan. Having experienced many sea accidents in his life, Kawasaki deepened his trust in Western ships because they were more spacious, stable and faster than typical Japanese ships. At the same time, he became very interested in the modern shipbuilding industry. In April 1876, supported by Matsukata Masayoshi, the Vice Minister of Finance, who was from the same province as Kawasaki, he established Kawasaki Tsukiji Shipyard on borrowed land from the government alongside the Sumida-gawa River, Tsukiji Minami-Iizaka-ch≈ç (currently Tsukiji 7-chome, Ch≈´≈ç, Tokyo, a major step forward as a shipbuilder.

The film is set in the mid-22nd century when humans are colonizing Pandora, a lush habitable moon of a gas giant in the Alpha Centauri star system, in order to mine the mineral unobtanium, a room-temperature superconductor.This property of Unobtanium is stated in movie guides, rather than in the film. The expansion of the mining colony threatens the continued existence of a local tribe of Na'vi ‚Äì a humanoid species indigenous to Pandora. The film's title refers to a genetically engineered Na'vi body operated from the brain of a remotely located human that is used to interact with the natives of Pandora. Development of Avatar began in 1994, when Cameron wrote an 80-page treatment for the film. Filming was supposed to take place after the completion of Cameron's 1997 film Titanic, for a planned release in 1999, but, according to Cameron, the necessary technology was not yet available to achieve his vision of the film. Work on the language of the film's extraterrestrial beings began in 2005, and Cameron began developing the screenplay and fictional universe in early 2006. Avatar was officially budgeted at $237 million. Other estimates put the cost between $280 million and $310 million for production and at $150 million for promotion. The film made extensive use of new motion capture filming techniques, and was released for traditional viewing, 3D viewing (using the RealD 3D, Dolby 3D, XpanD 3D, and IMAX 3D formats), and for \\"4D\\" experiences in select South Korean theaters. The stereoscopic filmmaking was touted as a breakthrough in cinematic technology. Avatar premiered in London on , 2009, and was released in the United States on to positive reviews, with critics highly praising its groundbreaking visual effects. During its theatrical run, the film broke several box office records and became the highest-grossing film at the time, as well as in the United States and Canada,Unadjusted for inflation. See also List of highest-grossing films in Canada and the United States#Adjusted for ticket-price inflation surpassing Cameron's Titanic, which had held those records for twelve years. Avatar remained the highest-grossing film worldwide for nearly a decade, before being overtaken by Avengers: Endgame in 2019. To this day, Avatar remains the second highest-grossing movie of all time when adjusted for inflation after Gone with the Wind with a total of more than $3 billion. It also became the first film to gross more than and the best- selling film of 2010 in the United States. Avatar was nominated for nine Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, and won three, for Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, and Best Visual Effects. The success of the film also led to electronics manufacturers releasing 3D Televisions and caused 3D films to increase in popularity. Following the film's success, Cameron signed with 20th Century Fox to produce four sequels: Avatar 2 and Avatar 3 have completed principal filming, and are scheduled to be released on December 16, 2022, and December 20, 2024, respectively; subsequent sequels are scheduled to be released on December 18, 2026, and December 22, 2028. Several cast members are expected to return, including Worthington, Saldana, Lang, and Weaver.  Plot  In 2154, humans have depleted Earth's natural resources, leading to a severe energy crisis. The Resources Development Administration (RDA) mines a valuable mineral unobtanium on Pandora, a densely forested habitable moon orbiting Polyphemus, a fictional gas giant in the Alpha Centauri star system.

To explore Pandora's biosphere, scientists use Na'vi-human hybrids called \\"avatars\\", operated by genetically matched humans. Jake Sully, a paraplegic former Marine, replaces his deceased identical twin brother as an operator of one. Dr. Grace Augustine, head of the Avatar Program, considers Sully an inadequate replacement but accepts his assignment as a bodyguard. While escorting the avatars of Grace and fellow scientist Dr. Norm Spellman, Jake's avatar is attacked by a thanator and flees into the forest, where he is rescued by Neytiri, a female Na'vi. Witnessing an auspicious sign, she takes him to her clan. Neytiri's mother Mo'at, the clan's spiritual leader, orders her daughter to initiate Jake into their society. Colonel Miles Quaritch, head of RDA's private security force, promises Jake that the company will restore his legs if he gathers information about the Na'vi and the clan's gathering place, a giant tree called Hometree, which stands above the richest deposit of unobtanium in the area. When Grace learns of this, she transfers herself, Jake, and Norm to an outpost. Over the following three months, Jake and Neytiri fall in love as Jake grows to sympathize with the natives. After Jake is initiated into the tribe, he and Neytiri choose each other as mates. Soon afterward, Jake reveals his change of allegiance when he attempts to disable a bulldozer that threatens to destroy a sacred Na'vi site. When Quaritch shows a video recording of Jake's attack on the bulldozer to Administrator Parker Selfridge, and another in which Jake admits that the Na'vi will never abandon Hometree, Selfridge orders Hometree destroyed. Despite Grace's argument that destroying Hometree could damage the biological neural network native to Pandora, Selfridge gives Jake and Grace one hour to convince the Na'vi to evacuate before commencing the attack. Jake confesses to the Na'vi that he was a spy, and they take him and Grace captive. Quaritch's men destroy Hometree, killing Neytiri's father (the clan chief) and many others. Mo'at frees Jake and Grace, but they are detached from their avatars and imprisoned by Quaritch's forces. Pilot Trudy Chac√≥n, disgusted by Quaritch's brutality, frees Jake, Grace, and Norm, and airlifts them to Grace's outpost, but Grace is shot by Quaritch during the escape. To regain the Na'vi's trust, Jake connects his mind to that of Toruk, a dragon-like predator feared and honored by the Na'vi. Jake finds the refugees at the sacred Tree of Souls and pleads with Mo'at to heal Grace. The clan attempts to transfer Grace from her human body into her avatar with the aid of the Tree of Souls, but she dies before the process can be completed. Supported by the new chief Tsu'tey, Jake unites the clan and tells them to gather all of the clans to battle the RDA. Quaritch organizes a pre-emptive strike against the Tree of Souls, believing that its destruction will demoralize the natives. On the eve of battle, Jake prays to Eywa, via a neural connection with the Tree of Souls, to intercede on behalf of the Na'vi. During the subsequent battle, the Na'vi suffer heavy casualties, including Tsu'tey and Trudy, but are rescued when Pandoran wildlife unexpectedly join the attack and overwhelm the humans, which Neytiri interprets as Eywa's answer to Jake's prayer. Jake destroys a makeshift bomber before it can reach the Tree of Souls; Quaritch, wearing an AMP suit, escapes from his own damaged aircraft and breaks open the avatar link unit containing Jake's human body, exposing it to Pandora's poisonous atmosphere. Quaritch prepares to slit the throat of Jake's avatar, but Neytiri kills Quaritch and saves Jake from suffocation, seeing his human form for the first time. With the exceptions of Jake, Norm and a select few others, all humans are expelled from Pandora and sent back to Earth. Jake is permanently transferred into his avatar with the aid of the Tree of Souls.  Cast   Humans  *Sam Worthington as Jake Sully, a disabled former Marine who becomes part of the Avatar Program after his twin brother is killed. His military background helps the Na'vi warriors relate to him. Cameron cast the Australian actor after a worldwide search for promising young actors, preferring relative unknowns to keep the budget down. Worthington, who was living in his car at the time, auditioned twice early in development, and he has signed on for possible sequels. Cameron felt that because Worthington had not done a major film, he would give the character \\"a quality that is really real\\". Cameron said he \\"has that quality of being a guy you'd want to have a beer with, and he ultimately becomes a leader who transforms the world\\". **Sam Worthington also plays Jake's deceased twin brother, Tommy. *Stephen Lang as Colonel Miles Quaritch, the head of the mining operation's security detail. Fiercely consistent in his disregard for any life not recognized as human, he has a profound disregard for Pandora's inhabitants that is evident in both his actions and his language. Lang had unsuccessfully auditioned for a role in Cameron's Aliens (1986), but the director remembered Lang and sought him for Avatar. Michael Biehn, who had worked with Cameron in Aliens, The Terminator and Terminator 2: Judgment Day, was briefly considered for the role. He read the script and watched some of the 3-D footage with Cameron but was ultimately not cast. *Sigourney Weaver as Dr. Grace Augustine, an exobiologist and head of the Avatar Program. She is also Sully's mentor and an advocate of peaceful relations with the Na'vi, having set up a school to teach them English. *Michelle Rodriguez as Trudy Chac√≥n, a combat pilot assigned to support the Avatar Program who is sympathetic to the Na'vi. Cameron had wanted to work with Rodriguez since seeing her in Girlfight. *Giovanni Ribisi as Parker Selfridge, the corporate administrator for the RDA mining operation. While he is at first willing to destroy the Na'vi civilization to preserve the company's bottom line, he is reluctant to authorize the attacks on the Na'vi and taint his image, doing so only after Quaritch persuades him that it is necessary and that the attacks will be humane. When the attacks are broadcast to the base, Selfridge displays discomfort at the violence. *Joel David Moore as Dr. Norm Spellman, a xenoanthropologist Archived version , 2010 who studies plant and animal life as part of the Avatar Program. Archived version , 2010 He arrives on Pandora at the same time as Jake and operates an avatar. Although he is expected to lead the diplomatic contact with the Na'vi, it turns out that Jake has the personality better suited to win the natives' respect. *Dileep Rao as Dr. Max Patel, a scientist who works in the Avatar Program and comes to support Jake's rebellion against the RDA.  Na'vi  *Zoe Saldana as Neytiri, the daughter of the leader of the Omaticaya (the Na'vi clan central to the story). She is attracted to Jake because of his bravery, though frustrated with him for what she sees as his naivet√© and stupidity. She serves as Jake's love interest. The character, like all the Na'vi, was created using performance capture, and its visual aspect is entirely computer generated. Saldana has also signed on for potential sequels. *CCH Pounder as Mo'at, the Omaticaya's spiritual leader, Neytiri's mother, and consort to clan leader Eytukan. *Wes Studi as Eytukan, the Omaticaya's clan leader, Neytiri's father, and Mo'at's mate. *Laz Alonso as Tsu'tey, the finest warrior of the Omaticaya. He is heir to the chieftainship of the tribe. At the beginning of the film's story, he is betrothed to Neytiri.  Production   Origins  In 1994, director James Cameron wrote an 80-page treatment for Avatar, drawing inspiration from \\"every single science fiction book\\" he had read in his childhood as well as from adventure novels by Edgar Rice Burroughs and H. Rider Haggard. In , Cameron announced that after completing Titanic, he would film Avatar, which would make use of synthetic, or computer- generated, actors. The project would cost $100 million and involve at least six actors in leading roles \\"who appear to be real but do not exist in the physical world\\". Visual effects house Digital Domain, with whom Cameron has a partnership, joined the project, which was supposed to begin production in mid-1997 for a 1999 release. However, Cameron felt that the technology had not caught up with the story and vision that he intended to tell. He decided to concentrate on making documentaries and refining the technology for the next few years. It was revealed in a Bloomberg BusinessWeek cover story that 20th Century Fox had fronted $10 million to Cameron to film a proof-of-concept clip for Avatar, which he showed to Fox executives in . In February 2006, Cameron revealed that his film Project 880 was \\"a retooled version of Avatar\\", a film that he had tried to make years earlier, citing the technological advances in the creation of the computer-generated characters Gollum, King Kong, and Davy Jones. Cameron had chosen Avatar over his project Battle Angel after completing a five-day camera test in the previous year.  Development  From January to April 2006, Cameron worked on the script and developed a culture for the film's aliens, the Na'vi. Their language was created by Dr. Paul Frommer, a linguist at USC. The Na'vi language has a lexicon of about 1000 words, with some 30 added by Cameron. The tongue's phonemes include ejective consonants (such as the \\"kx\\" in \\"skxawng\\") that are found in the Amharic language of Ethiopia, and the initial \\"ng\\" that Cameron may have taken from New Zealand MƒÅori. Actress Sigourney Weaver and the film's set designers met with Jodie S. Holt, professor of plant physiology at University of California, Riverside, to learn about the methods used by botanists to study and sample plants, and to discuss ways to explain the communication between Pandora's organisms depicted in the film. From 2005 to 2007, Cameron worked with a handful of designers, including famed fantasy illustrator Wayne Barlowe and renowned concept artist Jordu Schell, to shape the design of the Na'vi with paintings and physical sculptures when Cameron felt that 3-D brush renderings were not capturing his vision, often working together in the kitchen of Cameron's Malibu home. In , Cameron announced that he would film Avatar for a mid-2008 release and planned to begin principal photography with an established cast by . The following August, the visual effects studio Weta Digital signed on to help Cameron produce Avatar. Stan Winston, who had collaborated with Cameron in the past, joined Avatar to help with the film's designs. Production design for the film took several years. The film had two different production designers, and two separate art departments, one of which focused on the flora and fauna of Pandora, and another that created human machines and human factors. In , Cameron was announced to be using his own Reality Camera System to film in 3-D. The system would use two high-definition cameras in a single camera body to create depth perception. While these preparations were underway, Fox kept wavering in its commitment to Avatar because of its painful experience with cost overruns and delays on Cameron's previous picture, Titanic, even though Cameron rewrote the script to combine several characters together and offered to cut his fee in case the film flopped. Cameron installed a traffic light with the amber signal lit outside of co-producer Jon Landau's office to represent the film's uncertain future. In mid-2006, Fox told Cameron \\"in no uncertain terms that they were passing on this film,\\" so he began shopping it around to other studios and approached Walt Disney Studios, showing his proof of concept to then chairman Dick Cook. However, when Disney attempted to take over, Fox exercised its right of first refusal. In , Fox finally agreed to commit to making Avatar after Ingenious Media agreed to back the film, which reduced Fox's financial exposure to less than half of the film's official $237 million budget. After Fox accepted Avatar, one skeptical Fox executive shook his head and told Cameron and Landau, \\"I don't know if we're crazier for letting you do this, or if you're crazier for thinking you can do this ...\\" In December 2006, Cameron described Avatar as \\"a futuristic tale set on a planet 200 years hence ... an old- fashioned jungle adventure with an environmental conscience [that] aspires to a mythic level of storytelling\\". The press release described the film as \\"an emotional journey of redemption and revolution\\" and said the story is of \\"a wounded former Marine, thrust unwillingly into an effort to settle and exploit an exotic planet rich in biodiversity, who eventually crosses over to lead the indigenous race in a battle for survival\\". The story would be of an entire world complete with an ecosystem of phantasmagorical plants and creatures, and native people with a rich culture and language. Estimates put the cost of the film at about $280‚Äì310 million to produce and an estimated $150 million for marketing, noting that about $30 million in tax credits will lessen the financial impact on the studio and its financiers. A studio spokesperson said that the budget was \\"$237 million, with $150 million for promotion, end of story.\\"  Themes and inspirations  Avatar is primarily an action- adventure journey of self-discovery, in the context of imperialism, and deep ecology. Archived version , 2010 Cameron said his inspiration was \\"every single science fiction book I read as a kid\\" and that he was particularly striving to update the style of Edgar Rice Burroughs' John Carter series and the deep jungles of Pandora were visualized from Disney's 37th animated film, Tarzan. He acknowledged that Avatar shares themes with the films At Play in the Fields of the Lord, The Emerald Forest, and Princess Mononoke, which feature clashes between cultures and civilizations, and with Dances with Wolves, where a battered soldier finds himself drawn to the culture he was initially fighting against. He also cited Hayao Miyazaki's anime films such as Princess Mononoke as an influence on the ecosystem of Pandora. In a 2007 interview with Time magazine, Cameron was asked about the meaning of the term Avatar, to which he replied, \\"It's an incarnation of one of the Hindu gods taking a flesh form. In this film what that means is that the human technology in the future is capable of injecting a human's intelligence into a remotely located body, a biological body.\\" Cameron also cited the Japanese cyberpunk manga and anime Ghost in the Shell, in terms of how humans can remotely control, and transfer their personalities into, alien bodies. Jake's avatar and Neytiri. One of the inspirations for the look of the Na'vi came from a dream that Cameron's mother had told him about. The look of the Na'vi ‚Äì the humanoids indigenous to Pandora ‚Äì was inspired by a dream that Cameron's mother had, long before he started work on Avatar. In her dream, she saw a blue-skinned woman 12 feet () tall, which he thought was \\"kind of a cool image\\". Also he said, \\"I just like blue. It's a good color ... plus, there's a connection to the Hindu deities,In Hinduism, the human manifestations of several deities, including Vishnu, Krishna, and Rama, have blue-colored skin. See Blue:Religion. which I like conceptually.\\" He included similar creatures in his first screenplay (written in 1976 or 1977), which featured a planet with a native population of \\"gorgeous\\" tall blue aliens. The Na'vi were based on them. For the love story between characters Jake and Neytiri, Cameron applied a star-crossed love theme, and acknowledged its similarity to the pairing of Jack and Rose from his film Titanic. An interviewer stated, \\"Both couples come from radically different cultures that are contemptuous of their relationship and are forced to choose sides between the competing communities.\\" Cameron felt that whether or not the Jake and Neytiri love story would be perceived as believable partially hinged on the physical attractiveness of Neytiri's alien appearance, which was developed by considering her appeal to the all-male crew of artists. Although Cameron felt Jake and Neytiri do not fall in love right away, their portrayers (Worthington and Saldana) felt the characters did. Cameron said the two actors \\"had a great chemistry\\" during filming. Pandora's floating \\"Hallelujah Mountains\\" were inspired in part by the Chinese alt=A gray mountain in the middle of a forest. Zhangjiajie National Forest Park For the film's floating \\"Hallelujah Mountains\\", the designers drew inspiration from \\"many different types of mountains, but mainly the karst limestone formations in China.\\" According to production designer Dylan Cole, the fictional floating rocks were inspired by Huangshan (also known as Yellow Mountain), Guilin, Zhangjiajie, among others around the world. Cameron had noted the influence of the Chinese peaks on the design of the floating mountains. To create the interiors of the human mining colony on Pandora, production designers visited the Noble Clyde Boudreaux oil platform in the Gulf of Mexico during . They photographed, measured and filmed every aspect of the platform, which was later replicated on-screen with photorealistic CGI during post-production. Cameron said that he wanted to make \\"something that has this spoonful of sugar of all the action and the adventure and all that\\" but also have a conscience \\"that maybe in the enjoying of it makes you think a little bit about the way you interact with nature and your fellow man\\". He added that \\"the Na'vi represent something that is our higher selves, or our aspirational selves, what we would like to think we are\\" and that even though there are good humans within the film, the humans \\"represent what we know to be the parts of ourselves that are trashing our world and maybe condemning ourselves to a grim future\\". Archived version , 2010 Cameron acknowledges that Avatar implicitly criticizes the United States' role in the Iraq War and the impersonal nature of mechanized warfare in general. In reference to the use of the term shock and awe in the film, Cameron said, \\"We know what it feels like to launch the missiles. We don't know what it feels like for them to land on our home soil, not in America.\\" He said in later interviews, \\"... I think it's very patriotic to question a system that needs to be corralled ...\\" and, \\"The film is definitely not anti-American.\\" A scene in the film portrays the violent destruction of the towering Na'vi Hometree, which collapses in flames after a missile attack, coating the landscape with ash and floating embers. Asked about the scene's resemblance to the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center, Cameron said he had been \\"surprised at how much it did look like \\".  Filming  Principal photography for Avatar began in in Los Angeles and Wellington. Cameron described the film as a hybrid with a full live-action shoot in combination with computer-generated characters and live environments. \\"Ideally at the end of the day the audience has no idea which they're looking at,\\" Cameron said. The director indicated that he had already worked four months on nonprincipal scenes for the film. The live action was shot with a modified version of the proprietary digital 3-D Fusion Camera System, developed by Cameron and Vince Pace. In , Fox had announced that 3-D filming for Avatar would be done at 24 frames per second despite Cameron's strong opinion that a 3-D film requires higher frame rate to make strobing less noticeable. According to Cameron, the film is composed of 60% computer-generated elements and 40% live action, as well as traditional miniatures. Motion-capture photography lasted 31 days at the Hughes Aircraft stage in Playa Vista in Los Angeles. Live action photography began in at Stone Street Studios in Wellington and was scheduled to last 31 days. More than a thousand people worked on the production. In preparation of the filming sequences, all of the actors underwent professional training specific to their characters such as archery, horseback riding, firearm use, and hand-to-hand combat. They received language and dialect training in the Na'vi language created for the film. Before shooting the film, Cameron also sent the cast to the Hawaiian tropical rainforests to get a feel for a rainforest setting before shooting on the soundstage. During filming, Cameron made use of his virtual camera system, a new way of directing motion-capture filmmaking. The system shows the actors' virtual counterparts in their digital surroundings in real time, allowing the director to adjust and direct scenes just as if shooting live action. According to Cameron, \\"It's like a big, powerful game engine. If I want to fly through space, or change my perspective, I can. I can turn the whole scene into a living miniature and go through it on a 50 to 1 scale.\\" Using conventional techniques, the complete virtual world cannot be seen until the motion-capture of the actors is complete. Cameron said this process does not diminish the value or importance of acting. On the contrary, because there is no need for repeated camera and lighting setups, costume fittings and make-up touch-ups, scenes do not need to be interrupted repeatedly. Cameron described the system as a \\"form of pure creation where if you want to move a tree or a mountain or the sky or change the time of day, you have complete control over the elements\\". Cameron gave fellow directors Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson a chance to test the new technology. Spielberg said, \\"I like to think of it as digital makeup, not augmented animation ... Motion capture brings the director back to a kind of intimacy that actors and directors only know when they're working in live theater.\\" Spielberg and George Lucas were also able to visit the set to watch Cameron direct with the equipment. To film the shots where CGI interacts with live action, a unique camera referred to as a \\"simulcam\\" was used, a merger of the 3-D fusion camera and the virtual camera systems. While filming live action in real time with the simulcam, the CGI images captured with the virtual camera or designed from scratch, are superimposed over the live action images as in augmented reality and shown on a small monitor, making it possible for the director to instruct the actors how to relate to the virtual material in the scene. Due to Cameron's personal convictions about climate change, he allowed only plant-based (vegan) food to be served on set.  Visual effects  alt=The left image shows the blue cat-like alien Neyitiri shouting. The right image shows the actress who portrays her, Zoe Saldana, with motion-capture dots across her face and a small camera in front of her eyes. A number of innovative visual effects techniques were used during production. According to Cameron, work on the film had been delayed since the 1990s to allow the techniques to reach the necessary degree of advancement to adequately portray his vision of the film. The director planned to make use of photorealistic computer-generated characters, created using new motion capture animation technologies he had been developing in the 14 months leading up to . Innovations include a new system for lighting massive areas like Pandora's jungle, a motion-capture stage or \\"volume\\" six times larger than any previously used, and an improved method of capturing facial expressions, enabling full performance capture. To achieve the face capturing, actors wore individually made skull caps fitted with a tiny camera positioned in front of the actors' faces; the information collected about their facial expressions and eyes is then transmitted to computers. According to Cameron, the method allows the filmmakers to transfer 100% of the actors' physical performances to their digital counterparts. Besides the performance capture data which were transferred directly to the computers, numerous reference cameras gave the digital artists multiple angles of each performance. A technically challenging scene was near the end of the film when the computer-generated Neytiri held the live action Jake in human form, and attention was given to the details of the shadows and reflected light between them. The lead visual effects company was Weta Digital in Wellington, at one point employing 900 people to work on the film. Because of the huge amount of data which needed to be stored, cataloged and available for everybody involved, even on the other side of the world, a new cloud computing and Digital Asset Management (DAM) system named Gaia was created by Microsoft especially for Avatar, which allowed the crews to keep track of and coordinate all stages in the digital processing. To render Avatar, Weta used a server farm making use of 4,000 Hewlett-Packard servers with 35,000 processor cores with 104 terabytes of RAM and three petabytes of network area storage running Ubuntu Linux, Grid Engine cluster manager, and 2 of the animation software and managers, Pixar's RenderMan and Pixar's Alfred queue management system. The render farm occupies the 193rd to 197th spots in the TOP500 list of the world's most powerful supercomputers. A new texturing and paint software system, called Mari, was developed by The Foundry in cooperation with Weta. Creating the Na'vi characters and the virtual world of Pandora required over a petabyte of digital storage, and each minute of the final footage for Avatar occupies 17.28 gigabytes of storage. It would often take the computer several hours to render a single frame of the film. To help finish preparing the special effects sequences on time, a number of other companies were brought on board, including Industrial Light & Magic, which worked alongside Weta Digital to create the battle sequences. ILM was responsible for the visual effects for many of the film's specialized vehicles and devised a new way to make CGI explosions. Joe Letteri was the film's visual effects general supervisor.  Music and soundtrack  Composer James Horner scored the film, his third collaboration with Cameron after Aliens and Titanic. Horner recorded parts of the score with a small chorus singing in the alien language Na'vi in . He also worked with Wanda Bryant, an ethnomusicologist, to create a music culture for the alien race. The first scoring sessions were planned to take place in early 2009. During production, Horner promised Cameron that he would not work on any other project except for Avatar and reportedly worked on the score from four in the morning until ten at night throughout the process. He stated in an interview, \\"Avatar has been the most difficult film I have worked on and the biggest job I have undertaken.\\" Horner composed the score as two different scores merged into one. He first created a score that reflected the Na'vi way of sound and then combined it with a separate \\"traditional\\" score to drive the film. British singer Leona Lewis was chosen to sing the theme song for the film, called \\"I See You\\". An accompanying music video, directed by Jake Nava, premiered , 2009, on MySpace.

The official game trailer and toy line of the film were also unveiled on this day. The 129-second trailer was released online on , 2009. The new 210-second trailer was premiered in theaters on , 2009, then soon after premiered online on Yahoo! on , 2009, to positive reviews. An extended version in IMAX 3D received overwhelmingly positive reviews. The Hollywood Reporter said that audience expectations were colored by \\"the [same] establishment skepticism that preceded Titanic\\" and suggested the showing reflected the desire for original storytelling. The teaser has been among the most viewed trailers in the history of film marketing, reaching the first place of all trailers viewed on Apple.com with 4 million views. On October 30, to celebrate the opening of the first 3-D cinema in Vietnam, Fox allowed Megastar Cinema to screen exclusive 16 minutes of Avatar to a number of press. The three-and-a-half-minute trailer of the film premiered live on , 2009, during a Dallas Cowboys football game at Cowboys Stadium in Arlington, Texas, on the Diamond Vision screen, one of the world's largest video displays, and to TV audiences viewing the game on Fox. It is said to be the largest live motion picture trailer viewing in history. The Coca-Cola Company collaborated with Fox to launch a worldwide marketing campaign to promote the film. The highlight of the campaign was the website AVTR.com. Specially marked bottles and cans of Coca-Cola Zero, when held in front of a webcam, enabled users to interact with the website's 3-D features using augmented reality (AR) technology. The film was heavily promoted in an episode of the Fox Network series Bones in the episode \\"The Gamer In The Grease\\" (Season 5, Episode 9). Avatar star Joel David Moore has a recurring role on the program, and is seen in the episode anxiously awaiting the release of the film. A week prior to the American release, Zoe Saldana promoted the film on Adult Swim when she was interviewed by an animated Space Ghost. McDonald's had a promotion mentioned in television commercials in Europe called \\"Avatarize yourself\\", which encouraged people to go to the website set up by Oddcast, and use a photograph of themselves to change into a Na'vi.

In a 2009 interview, Cameron said that he planned to write a novel version of Avatar after the film was released. In , producer Jon Landau stated that Cameron plans a prequel novel for Avatar that will \\"lead up to telling the story of the movie, but it would go into much more depth about all the stories that we didn't have time to deal with\\", saying that \\"Jim wants to write a novel that is a big, epic story that fills in a lot of things\\". In August 2013 it was announced that Cameron hired Steven Gould to pen four standalone novels to expand the Avatar universe.  Video game  Cameron chose Ubisoft Montreal to create an Avatar game for the film in 2007. The filmmakers and game developers collaborated heavily, and Cameron decided to include some of Ubisoft's vehicle and creature designs in the film. James Cameron's Avatar: The Game was released on , 2009, for most home video game consoles (PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, Nintendo DS, iPhone) and Microsoft Windows, and for PlayStation Portable.

Accessed August 23, 2015 In December 2009, France Post released a special limited edition stamp based on Avatar, coinciding with the film's worldwide release.  Release   Initial screening  Avatar premiered in London on , 2009, and was released theatrically worldwide from to 18. The film was originally set for release on , 2009, during filming, but was pushed back to allow more post-production time (the last shots were delivered in November), and to give more time for theaters worldwide to install 3D projectors. Cameron stated that the film's aspect ratio would be 1.78:1 for 3D screenings and that a 2.39:1 image would be extracted for 2D screenings. However, a 3D 2.39:1 extract was approved for use with constant-image-height screens (i.e. screens which increase in width to display 2.39:1 films). During a 3D preview showing in Germany on , the movie's DRM 'protection' system failed, and some copies delivered could not be watched at all in the theaters. The problems were fixed in time for the public premiere. Avatar was released in a total of 3,457 theaters in the US, of which 2,032 theaters ran it in 3D. In total 90% of all advance ticket sales for Avatar were for 3D screenings. Internationally, Avatar opened on a total of 14,604 screens in 106 territories, of which 3,671 were showing the film in 3D (producing 56% of the first weekend gross). The film was simultaneously presented in IMAX 3D format, opening in 178 theaters in the United States on . The international IMAX release included 58 theaters beginning on , and 25 more theaters were to be added in the coming weeks. The IMAX release was the company's widest to date, a total of 261 theaters worldwide. The previous IMAX record opening was Harry Potter and the Half- Blood Prince, which opened in 161 IMAX theaters in the US, and about 70 international. 20th Century Fox Korea adapted and later released Avatar in 4D version, which included \\"moving seats, smells of explosives, sprinkling water, laser lights and wind\\".  Box office  = General = Avatar was released internationally on more than 14,000 screens. It earned $3,537,000 from midnight screenings domestically (United States and Canada), with the initial 3D release limited to 2,200 screens. The film earned $26,752,099 on its opening day, and $77,025,481 over its opening weekend, making it the second-largest December opening ever behind I Am Legend, the largest domestic opening weekend for a film not based on a franchise (topping The Incredibles), the highest opening weekend for a film entirely in 3D (breaking Ups record), the highest opening weekend for an environmentalist film (breaking The Day After Tomorrows record), and the 40th largest opening weekend in North America, despite a blizzard that blanketed the East Coast of the United States and reportedly hurt its opening weekend results. The film also set an IMAX opening weekend record, with 178 theaters generating approximately $9.5 million, 12% of the film's $77 million (at the time) North American gross on less than 3% of the screens. International markets generating opening weekend tallies of at least $10 million were for Russia ($19.7 million), France ($17.4 million), the UK ($13.8 million), Germany ($13.3 million), South Korea ($11.7 million), Australia ($11.5 million), and Spain ($11.0 million). Avatars worldwide gross was US$241.6 million after five days, the ninth largest opening-weekend gross of all time, and the largest for a non-franchise, non- sequel and original film. 58 international IMAX screens generated an estimated $4.1 million during the opening weekend. Revenues in the film's second weekend decreased by only 1.8% in domestic markets, marking a rare occurrence, earning $75,617,183, to remain in first place at the box office and recording what was then the biggest second weekend of all time. The film experienced another marginal decrease in revenue in its third weekend, dropping 9.4% to $68,490,688 domestically, remaining in first place at the box office, to set a third-weekend record. Avatar crossed the $1 billion mark on the 19th day of its international release, making it the first film to reach this mark in only 19 days. It became the fifth film grossing more than $1 billion worldwide, and the only film of 2009 to do so. In its fourth weekend, Avatar continued to lead the box office domestically, setting a new all-time fourth-weekend record of $50,306,217, and becoming the highest-grossing 2009 release in the United States. In the film's fifth weekend, it set the Martin Luther King Day weekend record, grossing $54,401,446, and set a fifth-weekend record with a take of $42,785,612. It held the top spot to set the sixth and seventh weekend records earning $34,944,081 and $31,280,029 respectively. It was the fastest film to gross $600 million domestically, on its 47th day in theaters.Subers, Ray. \\"The Avengers Hits $600 Million\\", June 26, 2012 On , it became the first film to earn over worldwide, and it became the first film to gross over in the U.S. and Canada, on , after 72 days of release.

By the end of its first theatrical release Avatar had grossed $749,766,139 in the U.S. and Canada, and $ in other territories, for a worldwide total of $. Including the revenue from a re- release of Avatar featuring extended footage, Avatar grossed $760,507,625 in the U.S. and Canada, and $2,029,172,169 in other countries for a worldwide total of $2,789,679,794 with 72.7% of its total worldwide gross in international markets. Avatar has set a number of box office records during its release: on , 2010, it surpassed Titanics worldwide gross to become the highest-grossing film of all time worldwide 41 days after its international release, just two days after taking the foreign box office record. On , 47 days after its domestic release, Avatar surpassed Titanic to become the highest-grossing film of all time in Canada and the United States. It became the highest-grossing film of all time in at least 30 other countries and is the first film to earn over $2 billion in foreign box office receipts. IMAX ticket sales account for $243.3 million of its worldwide gross, more than double the previous record. Box Office Mojo estimates that after adjusting for the rise in average ticket prices, Avatar would be the 14th-highest-grossing film of all time in North America.\\"*Adjusted to the estimated 2010 average ticket price of $7.46\\" Box Office Mojo also observes that the higher ticket prices for 3D and IMAX screenings have had a significant impact on Avatars gross; it estimated, on , 2010, that Avatar had sold approximately tickets in North American theaters, more than any other film since 1999's Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace. On a worldwide basis, when Avatars gross stood at $2 billion just 35 days into its run, The Daily Telegraph estimated its gross was surpassed by only Gone with the Wind ($3.0 billion), Titanic ($2.9 billion), and Star Wars ($2.2 billion) after adjusting for inflation to 2010 prices, with Avatar ultimately winding up with $2.8 billion by the end of its run in 2010. Reuters even placed it ahead of Titanic after adjusting the global total for inflation. The 2015 edition of Guinness World Records lists Avatar only behind Gone with the Wind in terms of adjusted grosses worldwide.' = Commercial analysis = Before its release, various film critics and fan communities predicted the film would be a significant disappointment at the box office, in line with predictions made for Cameron's previous blockbuster Titanic. This criticism ranged from Avatars film budget, to its concept and use of 3-D \\"blue cat people\\". Slate magazine's Daniel Engber complimented the 3D effects, but criticized them for reminding him of certain CGI characters from the Star Wars prequel films and for having the \\"uncanny valley\\" effect. The New York Times noted that 20th Century Fox executives had decided to release Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel alongside Avatar, calling it a \\"secret weapon\\" to cover any unforeseeable losses at the box office. Box office analysts, on the other hand, estimated that the film would be a box office success. \\"The holy grail of 3-D has finally arrived,\\" said an analyst for Exhibitor Relations. \\"This is why all these 3-D venues were built: for Avatar. This is the one. The behemoth.\\" The \\"cautionary estimate\\" was that Avatar would bring in around $60 million in its opening weekend. Others guessed higher. There were also analysts who believed that the film's three- dimensionality would help its box office performance, given that recent 3D films had been successful. Cameron said he felt the pressure of the predictions, but that pressure is good for film-makers. \\"It makes us think about our audiences and what the audience wants,\\" he stated. \\"We owe them a good time. We owe them a piece of good entertainment.\\" Although he felt Avatar would appeal to everyone and that the film could not afford to have a target demographic, he especially wanted hard-core science-fiction fans to see it: \\"If I can just get 'em in the damn theater, the film will act on them in the way it's supposed to, in terms of taking them on an amazing journey and giving them this rich emotional experience.\\" Cameron was aware of the sentiment that Avatar would need significant \\"repeat business\\" just to make up for its budget and achieve box office success, and believed Avatar could inspire the same \\"sharing\\" reaction as Titanic. He said that film worked because, \\"When people have an experience that's very powerful in the movie theatre, they want to go share it. They want to grab their friend and bring them, so that they can enjoy it. They want to be the person to bring them the news that this is something worth having in their life.\\" After the film's release and unusually strong box office performance over its first two weeks, it was debated as the one film capable of surpassing Titanics worldwide gross, and its continued strength perplexed box office analysts. Other films in recent years had been cited as contenders for surpassing Titanic, such as 2008's The Dark Knight, but Avatar was considered the first film with a genuine chance to do so, and its numbers being aided by higher ticket prices for 3D screenings did not fully explain its success to box office analysts. \\"Most films are considered to be healthy if they manage anything less than a 50% drop from their first weekend to their second. Dipping just 11% from the first to the third is unheard of,\\" said Paul Dergarabedian, president of box-office analysis for Hollywood.com. \\"This is just unprecedented. I had to do a double take. I thought it was a miscalculation.\\" Analysts predicted second place for the film's worldwide gross, but most were uncertain about it surpassing Titanic because \\"Today's films flame out much faster than they did when Titanic was released.\\" Brandon Gray, president of Box Office Mojo, believed in the film's chances of becoming the highest-grossing film of all time, though he also believed it was too early to surmise because it had only played during the holidays. He said, \\"While Avatar may beat Titanics record, it will be tough, and the film is unlikely to surpass Titanic in attendance. Ticket prices were about $3 cheaper in the late 1990s.\\" Cameron said he did not think it was realistic to \\"try to topple Titanic off its perch\\" because it \\"just struck some kind of chord\\" and there had been other good films in recent years. He changed his prediction by mid-January. \\"It's gonna happen. It's just a matter of time,\\" he said. Although analysts have been unable to agree that Avatars success is attributable to one primary factor, several explanations have been advanced. First, January is historically \\"the dumping ground for the year's weakest films\\", and this also applied to 2010. Cameron himself said he decided to open the film in December so that it would have less competition from then to January. Titanic capitalized on the same January predictability, and earned most of its gross in 1998. Additionally, Avatar established itself as a \\"must- see\\" event. Gray said, \\"At this point, people who are going to see Avatar are going to see Avatar and would even if the slate was strong.\\" Marketing the film as a \\"novelty factor\\" also helped. Fox positioned the film as a cinematic event that should be seen in the theaters. \\"It's really hard to sell the idea that you can have the same experience at home,\\" stated David Mumpower, an analyst at BoxOfficeProphets.com. The \\"Oscar buzz\\" surrounding the film and international viewings helped. \\"Two-thirds of Titanics haul was earned overseas, and Avatar [tracked] similarly ...Avatar opened in 106 markets globally and was No. 1 in all of them\\", and the markets \\"such as Russia, where Titanic saw modest receipts in 1997 and 1998, are white-hot today\\" with \\"more screens and moviegoers\\" than before. According to Variety, films in 3D accumulated $1.3 billion in 2009, \\"a threefold increase over 2008 and more than 10% of the total 2009 box-office gross\\". The increased ticket price ‚Äì an average of $2 to $3 per ticket in most markets ‚Äì helped the film. Likewise, Entertainment Weekly attributed the film's success to 3D glasses, but also to its \\"astronomic word-of-mouth\\". Not only do some theaters charge up to $18.50 for IMAX tickets, but \\"the buzz\\" created by the new technology was the possible cause for sold-out screenings. Gray said Avatar having no basis in previously established material makes its performance remarkable and even more impressive. \\"The movie might be derivative of many movies in its story and themes,\\" he said, \\"but it had no direct antecedent like the other top-grossing films: Titanic (historical events), the Star Wars movies (an established film franchise), or The Lord of the Rings (literature). It was a tougher sell ...\\" The Hollywood Reporter estimated that after a combined production and promotion cost of between $387‚Äì437 million, the film turned a net profit of $1.2 billion.  Critical reception  The film received mostly positive reviews. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 82% based on 316 reviews, with a rating average of 7.43/10. The site's consensus reads, \\"It might be more impressive on a technical level than as a piece of storytelling, but Avatar reaffirms James Cameron's singular gift for imaginative, absorbing filmmaking.\\" On Metacritic ‚Äî which assigns a weighted mean score ‚Äî the film has a score of 83 out of 100 based on 35 critics, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"A\\" on an A+ to F scale. Every demographic surveyed was reported to give this rating. These polls also indicated that the main draw of the film was its use of 3D. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times called the film \\"extraordinary\\" and gave it four stars out of four. \\"Watching Avatar, I felt sort of the same as when I saw Star Wars in 1977,\\" he said, adding that like Star Wars and The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, the film \\"employs a new generation of special effects\\" and it \\"is not simply a sensational entertainment, although it is that. It's a technical breakthrough. It has a flat-out Green and anti-war message\\". A. O. Scott of At The Movies also compared his viewing of the film to the first time he viewed Star Wars and he said \\"although the script is a little bit ... obvious,\\" it was \\"part of what made it work\\". See parts of video of this television review at 3:00 and 3:52. Todd McCarthy of Variety praised the film, saying \\"The King of the World sets his sights on creating another world entirely in Avatar, and it's very much a place worth visiting.\\" Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a positive review. \\"The screen is alive with more action and the soundtrack pops with more robust music than any dozen sci-fi shoot-'em-ups you care to mention,\\" he stated. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone awarded Avatar a three-and-a-half out of four star rating and wrote in his print review \\"It extends the possibilities of what movies can do. Cameron's talent may just be as big as his dreams.\\" Richard Corliss of Time magazine thought that the film was \\"the most vivid and convincing creation of a fantasy world ever seen in the history of moving pictures.\\" Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times thought the film has \\"powerful\\" visual accomplishments but \\"flat dialogue\\" and \\"obvious characterization\\". James Berardinelli of ReelViews praised the film and its story, giving it four out of four stars; he wrote \\"In 3-D, it's immersive ‚Äì but the traditional film elements ‚Äì story, character, editing, theme, emotional resonance, etc. ‚Äì are presented with sufficient expertise to make even the 2-D version an engrossing 2-hour experience.\\" Avatars underlying social and political themes attracted attention. Armond White of the New York Press wrote that Cameron used \\"villainous American characters\\" to \\"misrepresent facets of militarism, capitalism, and imperialism\\".See also last paragraph of the above section Avatar Themes and inspirations. Russell D. Moore of The Christian Post concluded that \\"propaganda exists in the film\\" and stated \\"If you can get a theater full of people in Kentucky to stand and applaud the defeat of their country in war, then you've got some amazing special effects.\\" Adam Cohen of The New York Times was more positive about the film, calling its anti-imperialist message \\"a 22nd-century version of the American colonists vs. the British, India vs. the Raj, or Latin America vs. United Fruit\\". Ross Douthat of The New York Times opined that the film is \\"Cameron's long apologia for pantheism [...] Hollywood's religion of choice for a generation now\\", while Saritha Prabhu of The Tennessean called the film a \\"misportrayal of pantheism and Eastern spirituality in general\\",Alt URL and Maxim Osipov of The Hindustan Times, on the contrary, commended the film's message for its overall consistency with the teachings of Hinduism in the Bhagavad Gita. Annalee Newitz of io9 concluded that Avatar is another film that has the recurring \\"fantasy about race\\" whereby \\"some white guy\\" becomes the \\"most awesome\\" member of a non-white culture. Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune called Avatar \\"the season's ideological Rorschach blot\\", while Miranda Devine of The Sydney Morning Herald thought that \\"It [was] impossible to watch Avatar without being banged over the head with the director's ideological hammer.\\" Nidesh Lawtoo believed that an essential, yet less visible social theme that contributed to Avatars success concerns contemporary fascinations with virtual avatars and \\"the transition from the world of reality to that of virtual reality\\".Lawtoo, Nidesh, \\"Avatar Simulation in 3 Ts: Techne, Trance, Transformation.\\" Science Fiction Studies 125. 41.1 March 2015 Critics and audiences have cited similarities with other films, literature or media, describing the perceived connections in ways ranging from simple \\"borrowing\\" to outright plagiarism. Ty Burr of The Boston Globe called it \\"the same movie\\" as Dances with Wolves. Like Dances with Wolves, Avatar has been characterized as being a \\"white savior\\" movie, in which a \\"backwards\\" native people is impotent without the leadership of a member of the invading white culture.Sirota, David (February 21, 2013). \\"Oscar loves a white savior\\".

Retrieved , 2009. Cinema audiences in Russia have noted that Avatar has elements in common with the 1960s Noon Universe novels by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky, which are set in the 22nd century on a forested world called Pandora with a sentient indigenous species called the Nave. Various reviews have compared Avatar to the films FernGully: The Last Rainforest, Pocahontas and The Last Samurai. NPR's Morning Edition has compared the film to a montage of tropes, with one commentator stating that Avatar was made by \\"mixing a bunch of film scripts in a blender\\". Gary Westfahl wrote that \\"the science fiction story that most closely resembles Avatar has to be Ursula Le Guin's novella The Word for World Is Forest (1972), another epic about a benevolent race of alien beings who happily inhabit dense forests while living in harmony with nature until they are attacked and slaughtered by invading human soldiers who believe that the only good gook is a dead gook.\\" The science fiction writer and editor Gardner Dozois said that along with the Anderson and Le Guin stories, the \\"mash-up\\" included Alan Dean Foster's 1975 novel, Midworld. Some sources saw similarities to the artwork of Roger Dean, which featured fantastic images of floating rock formations and dragons. In 2013, Dean sued Cameron and Fox, claiming that Pandora was inspired by 14 of his images. Dean sought damages of $50m. Dean's case was dismissed in 2014, and The Hollywood Reporter noted that Cameron has won multiple Avatar idea theft cases.Couch, Aaron.

Noted art director-turned-filmmaker Roger Christian is also a noted fan of the film. On the other hand, Duncan Jones said: \\"It's not in my top three James Cameron films. ... [A]t what point in the film did you have any doubt what was going to happen next?\\". For French filmmaker Luc Besson, Avatar opened the doors for him to now create an adaptation of the graphic novel series Val√©rian and Laureline that technologically supports the scope of its source material, with Besson even throwing his original script in the trash and redoing it after seeing the film. TIME ranked Avatar number 3 in their list of \\"The 10 Greatest Movies of the Millennium (Thus Far)\\" also earning it a spot on the magazine's All-Time 100 list, and IGN listed Avatar as number 22 on their list of the top 25 Sci-Fi movies of all time.

Special Edition re-release  In July 2010, Cameron confirmed that there would be an extended theatrical re-release of the film on , 2010, exclusively in 3D theaters and IMAX 3D. Avatar: Special Edition includes an additional nine minutes of footage, all of which is CG, including an extension of the sex scene and various other scenes that were cut from the original theatrical film. This extended re-release resulted in the film's run time approaching the current IMAX platter maximum of 170 minutes, thereby leaving less time for the end credits. Cameron stated that the nine minutes of added scenes cost more than a minute to produce and finish. During its 12-week re-release, Avatar: Special Edition grossed an additional $10.74 million in North America and $22.46 million overseas for a worldwide total of $33.2 million.  Extended home media release  20th Century Fox Home Entertainment released the film on DVD and Blu-ray in the US on , 2010, and in the UK on . The US release was not on a Tuesday as is the norm, but was done to coincide with Earth Day. The first DVD and Blu-ray release does not contain any supplemental features other than the theatrical film and the disc menu in favor of and to make space for optimal picture and sound. The release also preserves the film's native 1.78:1 (16:9) format as Cameron felt that was the best format to watch the film. The Blu-ray disc contains DRM (BD+ 5) which some Blu-ray players might not support without a firmware update. Avatar set a first-day launch record in the U.S. for Blu-ray sales at 1.5 million units sold, breaking the record previously held by The Dark Knight (600,000 units sold). First-day DVD and Blu-ray sales combined were over four million units sold.

Three different versions of the film are present on the discs: the original theatrical cut, the special edition cut, and a collector's extended cut (with the DVD set spreading them on two discs, but the Blu-ray set presenting them on a single disc). The collector's extended cut contains 6 more minutes of footage, thus making it 16 minutes longer than the original theatrical cut. Cameron mentioned, \\"you can sit down, and in a continuous screening of the film, watch it with the Earth opening\\". He stated the \\"Earth opening\\" is an additional 4 minutes of scenes that were in the film for much of its production but were ultimately cut before the film's theatrical release. The release also includes an additional 45 minutes of deleted scenes and other extras.

The Blu-ray 3D version was finally released on October 16, 2012.  Sequels  Two sequels to Avatar were initially confirmed after the success of the first film; this number was subsequently expanded to four. Their respective release dates were previously December 17, 2021, December 22, 2023, December 19, 2025, and December 17, 2027 but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the four Avatar sequels releases have been delayed; their respective release dates are currently December 16, 2022, December 20, 2024, December 18, 2026, and December 22, 2028. Cameron is directing, producing and co-writing all four; Josh Friedman, Rick Jaffa, Amanda Silver, and Shane Salerno all took a part in the writing process of all of the sequels before being assigned to finish the separate scripts, making the eventual writing credits for each film unclear. Filming for the first two sequels began in September 2017. Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Giovanni Ribisi, Joel David Moore, Dileep Rao, and CCH Pounder are all reprising their roles, as are Stephen Lang and Matt Gerald, despite the deaths of their characters in the first film. Sigourney Weaver is also returning, although she stated that she would play a different character. New cast members include Cliff Curtis and Kate Winslet as members of the Na'vi reef people of Metkayina and Oona Chaplin as Varang, a \\"strong and vibrant central character who spans the entire saga of the sequels\\". Seven child actors will also portray pivotal new characters through the sequels: Jamie Flatters, Britain Dalton, and Trinity Bliss as Jake and Neytiri's children, Bailey Bass, Filip Geljo, and Duane Evans Jr. as free-divers of the Metkayina, and Jack Champion as a human. Although the last two sequels have been greenlit, Cameron stated in an interview on November 26, 2017, \\"Let's face it, if Avatar 2 and 3 don't make enough money, there's not going to be a 4 and 5\\". On November 14, 2018, Cameron announced filming on Avatar 2 and 3 with the principal performance capture cast had been completed.

The attraction offers shows in different languages depending on the version‚ÄîCantonese, English and Mandarin in the original Hong Kongese version (Cantonese only for the 2019 event), French and English in the Parisian version, Japanese in the Tokyo version, and Mandarin in the Chinese version‚Äîto accommodate the variety of languages guests in the different parks speak. Showtimes are available at the entrance of the attraction and each show has a length of approximately 15 minutes. Attraction description Guests are seated in a movie theater-like room, called the Space Traffic Control. Children are then encouraged to sit up front, on the floor, so that Stitch can see them during the show. At the start of the show, the host of the Space Traffic Control requests the computer to search for an available spacecraft captain to talk to, the computer connects to the spacecraft which Stitch is in. After that, guests (both children and adults) in the Space Traffic Control are randomly chosen by Stitch to interact with. Stitch can interact with guests in many ways such as chatting, singing them a song with his ukulele and even take their pictures. Stitch looks, moves and sounds much like he does in the films and Lilo & Stitch: The Series, complete with corresponding facial expressions, gestures, and vocals (which the hidden actor performing him delivers in a mimicry of that used by the character's creator and original voice actor, Chris Sanders). The conclusion of the show occurs when the audience aids Stitch in his escape from Captain Gantu (Kevin Michael Richardson).
