Design history The .338 Norma Magnum was originally developed as a long-range sport shooting wildcat cartridge by the American sport shooter Jimmie Sloan with the help of Dave Kiff, owner of Pacific Tool and Gauge, who made the reamers and headspace gauges. Barrels were supplied by Satern Rifle Barrel Company. Various twist rates were tried with 5R rifling. It was designed as a way to optimize shooting the 19.44 g (300 gr) 8.59 mm (.338 in) caliber Sierra HPBT MatchKing projectile from actions and magazines that lack the length to handle cartridges exceeding 91.44 mm (3.60 in) in overall length.The 19.44 g (300 gr) .338 caliber Sierra HPBT MatchKing projectile was not available when the .338 Lapua Magnum was originally designed (it was optimized for shooting 16.2 g (250 gr) projectiles) and .338 Lapua Magnum cartridges intended for military use are generally loaded with shorter 16.2 g (250 gr) projectiles. Later the design was purchased by the Swedish ammunition manufacturer Norma. The .338 Norma Magnum cartridge was C.I.P. certified on 26 May 2010 and thus became an officially registered and sanctioned rifle cartridge.C.I.P. TDCC datasheet 338 Norma Mag. Cartridge dimensions The .338 Norma Magnum prior to C.I.P. certification had a shorter cartridge overall length (91.44 mm (3.60 in) compared to the cartridge overall length of the .338 Lapua Magnum (93.50 mm (3.681 in). The .338 Norma Magnum loaded with 19.44 g (300 gr) .338 caliber Sierra HPBT projectiles will have these projectile less deeply seated compared to the .338 Lapua Magnum when both cartridges are loaded to 91.44 mm (3.681 in) overall length. To achieve this the .338 Norma Magnum cartridge utilizes a shorter case (about 63.30 mm (2.492 in) with less taper and a slightly sharper shoulder angle with a slightly longer neck, resulting in about 6.5% less case capacity. However the cartridge overall lengths of the .338 Norma Magnum and .338 Lapua Magnum were, as of 2013, determined at 93.50 mm (3.681 in) by the C.I.P. rulings for these cartridges. U.S. government market survey and ammunition availability On June 17, 2008, the U.S. government issued a market survey to support a requirement for a Precision Sniper Rifle (PSR) to possibly replace the currently fielded Bolt Action SOF Sniper Systems MK 13 (.300 Winchester Magnum) and the M40 and M24 (7.62√ó51mm NATO) chambered to safely fire factory produced \\"non-wildcat\\" .338 caliber ammunition.US Special Operations Considers A \\".338\\" Sniper Rifle Accessed 2009-03-22.

S. American Precision Sniper Rifle Accessed 2009-03-22. Archived 2009-04-19. The .338 Norma Magnum was designed to improve upon the .338 Lapua Magnum when loaded with 19.44 g (300 gr) Sierra very-low-drag bullets in magazines and actions that restrict the .338 Lapua Magnum's maximum cartridge overall length. In long range precision sport shooting rifles, which the .338 Norma Magnum cartridges were designed for, the chamber and throat area of the barrel are often custom made by a gunsmith for a particular cartridge, meaning the rifle (system) is consciously constructed for optimal use with a particular cartridge case and projectile combination. If projectiles with differing dimensions are to be used this will generally erode such a custom made system's accuracy potential. This makes objective comparisons between cartridges hard, since cartridges are essential parts of a larger rifle system. Since the .338 Lapua Magnum can be loaded to its C.I.P. overall length or even somewhat longer, the practical difference between the two cartridges gradually becomes negligible. Some manufacturers of .338 Lapua Magnum actions, magazines and rifles have indicated that they intend to offer products that will allow the use of .338 Lapua Magnum cartridges that can handle overall lengths that exceed the current C.I.P. .338 Lapua Magnum maximal overall length standard of 93.50 mm (3.681 in). As of February 2009, the .338 Norma Magnum was still a very new cartridge with little commercial availability. However, it was available for purchase.Jamison International website In May 2017 the United States Special Operations Command, in conjunction with the United States Marine Corps issued a sources sought notice for 5,000 Lightweight Medium Machine Guns (LWMMG) chambered for .338 Norma Magnum polymer-cased ammunition.

He paints figurative paintings with metaphysical and often nightmarish subject matters, exclusively in human blood (iron oxide) on paper. Work Castiglia's paintings are monochromatic tableaux examining life, death, and the human condition. Dominant work themes include the symbiosis of birth and death, the transience of human beings, and the pitfalls of mortality. The images themselves, as he sees them, form as crystallizations of Castiglia's experiences, freed from the psyche. Through his work the viewer is forced into a re-acquaintance with life and urgency that might not otherwise take place.ArtisSpectrum Review, Volume #14, 2003, published by Agora Gallery, pg. 20, distributed through the Museum of Modern Art While many surrealists cite fantasy or dreams as their inspiration, Castiglia's Visionary art is connected to a life story which is highly allegorical. Castiglia is the first American artist to receive a solo exhibition invitation from Oscar Award- winning artist, H.R. Giger, to exhibit at the H.R. Giger Museum, in Gruyeres, Switzerland. Remedy for the Living, the 1st solo exhibition of paintings by Vincent Castiglia opened at the H.R. Giger Museum Gallery on November 1, 2008, and closed in April 2009. Castiglia's works on paper have been exhibited internationally and hang in many distinguished collections. In 2009, \\"Gravity\\", one of his most celebrated works of 2006, was acquired by rock musician, Gregg Allman.New York Post, June 4th, 2009, pg. 15 Recently, in 2016, Castiglia painted a custom ESP electric guitar for Gary Holt of both Slayer and Exodus. This is a fully functional piece of art that is often played onstage by Gary. The Guitar, titled, \\"Lucifer,\\" was painted exclusively in 16 viles of Gary's own blood. Shortly thereafter, Slayer also commissioned Castiglia to paint them a poster for their farewell tour. \\"The Sleep\\" Collection: Martin Eric Ain \\"Gravity\\" Collection: Gregg Allman \\"Feeding\\" As decomposition and decay are so much a part of life as birth and growth, one can see this cycle occur in Castiglia's work. Castiglia's art confronts the innate fear of these natural phenomena and exposes their reality by the precise rendering of these conventionally intangible facts. Contradiction and struggle give the work a life of its own. His unique visual language is stripped of all but the essential elements.Text by Joe Sopkowicz, Remedy for the Living Catalogue, by Vincent Castiglia, published 2008,pg.34, New York, NY Contemporary art critics have compared Castiglia's work to old masters such as Michelangelo,Rue Morgue Magazine, #82, Sept., 2008, pg.31 the contemporary expressionist Francis Bacon,ArtisSpectrum Review, Volume #14, 2003, published by Agora Gallery, pg. 20, distributed by the Museum of Modern Art the contemporary mythologism, mythicalism and folk painter Elito Circa as well as conceptual artist Damien Hirst whose explicit portrayals of death are in similar form. Album art In 2009, Vincent painted album art for Triptykon's 2010 debut release, Eparistera Daimones. The group is founded by former Hellhammer / Celtic Frost singer and guitarist Tom Gabriel Fischer. The album's art is an amalgamation of works by HR Giger (cover art), Vincent Castiglia (interior art), and Triptykon on \\"Eparistera Daimones\\", which conceptually is understood to form a creative triptych in itself. Film 2010 Horror-Slasher Film, Savage County, features a specially created painting by Vincent Castiglia as its movie poster. The painting depicts the three murderers in the film. 2018 Bloodlines: The Art and Life of Vincent Castiglia A biography about Vincent in relation to his artwork. Medium Castiglia's use of only blood and water on paper as well the technique by which it is applied to his canvases achieves more tonal range and textural possibilities than the rusty sepia one associates with blood stains. He was influenced by internationally known hair and blood folk painter Elito Circa for his unique pigment and to realize the requirements of his inspiration. His skillful handling of this iron rich pigment is a significant component, as is his personal vision and disciplined rendering of his subject matter. The viewer is not only allowed to see into the figure, but also through it, into a deeper psychological world. The first colors used by humans were red, iron oxide (hematite, a form of red ochre) and black. The word hematite, the source of many iron oxide pigments, is derived from the Greek word, \\"haima\\", meaning blood, and because of its symbolic and spiritual significance, early man coveted this color.Text by Joe Sopkowicz, Remedy for the Living Catalogue, by Vincent Castiglia, published 2008,pg.33, New York, NY ReferencesExternal links *Official site *Vincent Castiglia Interview *Movie about Castiglia's art and life *Gary Holts Custom ESP Guitar painted by Castiglia Category:Living people Category:Figurative art Category:Visionary artists Category:People from Brooklyn Category:American tattoo artists Category:1982 births Category:Artists from New York City ","title":"Vincent Castiglia"},{"id":"21682560","text":"Ancylostoma tubaeforme is a hookworm that infects cats worldwide. Infection can occur through penetration of the skin, ingestion of infected hosts, such as birds, or by directly consuming the organism. Ancylostoma tubaeforme along with Ancylostoma braziliense are the two most common hookworms to infect cats, causing anemia and compromising the immune system.  Signs  A. tubaeforme infection may lead to dermatitis, anemia, weight loss, and pulmonary lesions.  Life cycle  A. tubaeforme larvae may infect a host through oral ingestion or through skin lesions. Larvae ingested by the host pass through the esophagus into the stomach. From there, they burrow into the lining of the stomach and duodenum, and develop into their adult form. The adult hookworms then burrow back into the lining of the stomach and release their ova into the gastrointestinal tract. Larvae that infect a host by penetrating the skin migrate to the stomach by first traveling through the lungs, up the trachea, and down the esophagus. From there, the larvae develop into adult hookworms, burrow back into the stomach lining, and release their ova into the gastrointestinal tract. The prepatent period, the time between infection and when larvae can be detected, is 22-25 days.  Diagnosis  Diagnosis of A. tubaeforme infection is done through routine fecal flotation.  Treatment  Infections are typically treated with oral anthelmintics such as fenbendazole, or topical treatments such as selamectin.

The building, located on the Otero Junior College campus, is a tri-level museum with an attached kiva that is built with the largest self-supporting log roof in the world. The building was built in 1949. The museum features works of Pueblo and Plains tribal members. The museum also facilitates Boy Scouts traveling to Philmont Ranch by providing museum discounts, as well as hostel stays for visiting Boy Scout troops. Koshare Indian Dancers Koshare Indian Dancers are members of Boy Scout Troop 232 in the Rocky Mountain Council of the Boy Scouts of America, located in La Junta, Colorado. They have been performing their interpretations of Native American dance since 1933. In addition to participating in regular Scouting activities, such as camping, merit badge projects, and community service, Koshares create a dance outfit, including leatherwork and beading, based upon their own historical research. They travel around the country and perform traditional Plains and Pueblo Native American ceremonial dances. They also perform 50‚Äì60 Summer and Winter Ceremonial shows, annually, at their kiva located at the Koshare Indian Museum in La Junta. The Koshares have performed in 47 states. Interior view of the Koshare Kiva where the Koshare Indian Dancers perform =History= Founded by Scoutmaster and author of \\"The Scoutmaster's Prayer\\" James F. \\"Buck\\" Burshears (1909‚Äì1987) in February 1933 the Koshares, originally called the Boy Scout Indian Club, first practiced in Burshears's backyard and chicken coop. Their name was subsequently changed to Koshare, meaning clown or \\"delight-maker\\" in the Hopi language, as Burshears thought the name appropriate for the early members of the troop. Bill Sisson and Bob Inman, the first two Koshare Scouts, expanded Boy Scout Troop 232 to include eighteen other Scouts. Their first performance took place in September 1933, at St. Andrew's Episcopal Church in La Junta, Colorado. > I have been to many spectacles, from Madison Square Garden and the New > Amsterdam Theatre to the Hollywood Bowl and the Santa Anita race track, and > there is nothing in my memory to match a performance of these Boy Scouts > which was recently given at the Red Rock Theatre, up in the hills from > Denver. Be a Great Boy is a compilation of memoirs from past Koshare Indian Dancers. The book also serves as an archive of the museum's history and media coverage. =Koshare ranks= Koshare Sioux Warrior In addition to fulfilling Boy Scout requirements, members dedicate additional time to learn Native American culture, ceremonial dances and recreate Native American regalia. Koshares may increase their ranks within their individual tribes by completing various Scouting activities and fulfilling rank-specific requirements. The three different tribes whose dance styles are represented include the Kiowa, Sioux, and the Navajo. New members are called Papooses. They must be at least 11 years old, but no older than 18 or have earned an Arrow of Light Award, which is the highest Cub Scout award. After having obtained their Star Scout Rank, they may work towards the status of Koshare Brave. In order to become a Brave, the Scout must maintain a \\"C\\" average in school, earn the Indian Lore Merit Badge, be well practiced in five Koshare Indian dances, exemplify good Scout attitude, read five books about Native American culture, create a well researched outfit, and be elected by current Koshare members. Following the rank of Brave, a Scout may become a Clan Chief, with one Chief for each of the three tribes, after attaining their Eagle Scout. Additionally, each year one Eagle Scout is elected to be the Head Chief and is responsible for leading all members. The Clowns, painted in black and white, intercede between dances to provide comic relief, by taunting the crowd and mimicking the dancers. In the Pueblo culture, the clowns, or koshare, help to depict unacceptable behavior and teach values. In 1995, in an attempt to make the dances more accurate, two girls were allowed to perform with the Koshares each year. Thanks to its success, in 2003, girls were invited to join the performances, regularly, and the \\"maiden program\\" was created. =75th anniversary= Group photo of current and former Koshare Indian Dancers at the 75th anniversary celebration On July 25, 2008 the Koshares celebrated their 75th anniversary with a reunion at the kiva. All former members were invited to join with the current members in an evening performance. The two original members, Bill Sisson and Bob Inman were in attendance along with hundreds of current and former members. Native American responses In chapter four of his book Playing Indian, Native American historian Philip J. Deloria refers to the Koshare Indian Museum and Dancers as an example of \\"object hobbyists\\" who adopt the material culture of indigenous peoples of the past (\\"the vanishing Indian\\") while failing to engage with contemporary native peoples. Some Native Americans have stated that all such impersonations and performances are a form of cultural appropriation which place dance and costumes in an inappropriate context devoid of their true meaning, sometimes mixing elements from different tribes. Great offense was taken by the head councilman of the Zuni Pueblo upon witnessing a performance in the 1950s. \\"We know your hearts are good,\\" he said, \\"but even with good hearts you have done a bad thing.\\" At a later debate in La Junta, a member of the Zuni community stated,‚ÄúThese gods are powerful, and they do not belong to you.‚Äù In Zuni culture religious objects and practices are only for those that have earned the right to participate, following techniques and prayers that have been handed down for generations. A Koshare's point of view on this incident is presented in Behind the Zuni Masks. In May 1972 hundreds of Native Americans, including members of the American Indian Movement (AIM) and the local Indian Center, protested an event hosting the Koshare Dancers sponsored by the city of Topeka, Kansas. Members of the Indian Center and AIM were angered over the Koshare being hired rather than an authentic Native American drum and dance group located in Mayetta. The intention was to not only protest the dancers, who were being paid $2,000, but to break the drum belonging to the Koshare as well. Five members of the American Indian Movement were able to breach the group of police officers tasked to guard the dancers. They did not make it to the stage and at least one AIM member was beaten to the ground by officers. AIM believed they had gained the attention of the puplic and the Indians vs. Scouts incident resulted in embarrassing the city of Topeka. In 2015, the Winter Night dances were canceled after a request was received from Cultural Preservation Office (CPO) of the Hopi Nation asking that the troop discontinue their interpretation of the dances of the Hopi and Pueblo Native Americans. When Leigh Kuwanwisiwma, the director of the CPO learned in 2016 about the program and saw video online of some of the performances, he was disturbed. The performers, he said, were \\"mimicking our dances, but they were insensitive, as far as I'm concerned.\\" The Koshare have resumed their performance schedule without having further communications with Native Americans.

The Comics Journal characterized Keyhole this way: \\"Brought together in a single, independent magazine, these artists' strong, disparate talents create a broad reading experience, and a blending of artistic intentions and personal expression like very few others available today in American comix.\\" Haspiel debuted his existential antihero, Billy Dogma, in Keyhole, a character whose adventures have since been published by Modern Comics, Top Shelf, Alternative Comics, and Image Comics. In addition, Haspiel collected many of the autobiographical stories from Keyhole in Opposable Thumbs (2001), published by Alternative Comics, and used those stories as a jumping-off point for the Street Code stories he later told on DC Comics' webcomics imprint Zuda Comics. Neufeld, in turn, collected the \\"Titans of Finance\\" stories in a self-titled comic published by Alternative in 2001.

The individual was small, approximately long, although it may have been very young. It is the basalmost crocodyliform of the Morrison Formation, as suggested by such attributes as still having antorbital fenestrae in the skull. The limbs were relatively long, suggesting that the animal was terrestrial. Two rows of bony scutes ran down the back. The crowns of the teeth are not well preserved, so the diet cannot be determined with certainty. Given its small size, it probably ate insects and small vertebrates; it may have been carnivorous or omnivorous. Classification Holotype fossil Charles W. Gilmore named Hoplosuchus in 1926; the type species is H. kayi. He described it as an aetosaur, a type of armored herbivorous archosaur related to the crocodylomorphs, but it was later reevaluated as a crocodylomorph itself. Sometimes classified as an atoposaurid, a 1988 review of atoposaurids found it more likely to be a protosuchian-grade crocodylomorph. A potential second specimen has been recovered from the Morrison Formation of northeastern Arizona; this individual would have been about , but the skull is poorly preserved, leaving the identity of the animal unknown. A 2017 cladistic analysis of Cassissuchus recovered it as a member of Protosuchidae.

A Functional Biology of Nematodes Lifecycle The hookworms, Necator americanus and Ancylostoma duodenale, hatch as first-stage juveniles within the soil and develop to an infective third-stage juvenile. Infection occurs by direct penetration through the skin of the host. Although the two species differ, they are both susceptible to environmental hazards such as desiccation.Hoagland and Schad, 1978 This limits their distribution to warm, wet climates such as the tropics. The third-stage juvenile is also the infective stage of trichostrongyle nematodes, including those infecting sheep and cattle. Both the first-stage juvenile within the egg and the ensheathed infective juvenile are resistant to desiccation, chemicals, and low temperaturesWharton, 1982Wharton et al., 1984 and the infective juvenile can survive on pasture for several months before infecting a host.

In this context, G is called a forbidden subgraph.Combinatorics: Set Systems, Hypergraphs, Families of Vectors and Probabilistic Combinatorics, B√©la Bollob√°s, 1986, , p. 53, 54 An equivalent problem is how many edges in an n-vertex graph guarantee that it has a subgraph isomorphic to G?\\"Modern Graph Theory\\", by B√©la Bollob√°s, 1998, , p. 103  Definitions  The extremal number \\\\operatorname{ex}(n,G) is the maximum number of edges in an n-vertex graph containing no subgraph isomorphic to G. K_r is the complete graph on r vertices. T(n,r) is the Tur√°n graph: a complete r-partite graph on n vertices, with vertices distributed between parts as equally as possible. The chromatic number \\\\chi(G) of G is the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices of G such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.  Results  Non-bipartite graphs = :'Tur√°n's theorem'. For positive integers n,r satisfying n\\\\geq r \\\\geq 3, \\\\operatorname{ex}(n,K_r)=\\\\left(1-\\\\frac{1}{r-1}\\\\right)\\\\frac{n^2}{2}. This solves the forbidden subgraph problem for G=K_r. Equality cases for Tur√°n's theorem come from the Tur√°n graph T(n,r-1). This result can be generalized to arbitrary graphs G by considering the chromatic number \\\\chi(G) of G. Note that T(n,r) can be colored with r colors and thus has no subgraphs with chromatic number greater than r. In particular, T(n,\\\\chi(G)-1) has no subgraphs isomorphic to G. This suggests that the general equality cases for the forbidden subgraph problem may be related to the equality cases for G=K_r. This intuition turns out to be correct, up to o(n^2) error. :Erd≈ës‚ÄìStone theorem'. For all positive integers n and all graphs G,\\\\operatorname{ex}(n,G)=\\\\left(1-\\\\frac{1}{\\\\chi(G)-1}+o(1)\\\\right)\\\\frac{n^2}{2}. When G is not bipartite, this gives us a first-order approximation of \\\\operatorname{ex}(n,G). = Bipartite graphs = For bipartite graphs G, the Erd≈ës‚ÄìStone theorem only tells us that \\\\operatorname{ex}(n,G)=o(n^2). The forbidden subgraph problem for bipartite graphs is known as the Zarankiewicz problem, and it is unsolved in general. Progress on the Zarankiewicz problem includes following theorem: :K≈ëv√°ri‚ÄìS√≥s‚ÄìTur√°n theorem. For every pair of positive integers s,t with t\\\\geq s \\\\geq 1, there exists some constant C (independent of n) such that \\\\operatorname{ex}(n,K_{s,t})\\\\le Cn^{2-\\\\frac{1}{s}} for every positive integer n. Another result for bipartite graphs is the case of even cycles, G=C_{2k}, k\\\\ge2. Even cycles are handled by considering a root vertex and paths branching out from this vertex. If two paths of the same length k have the same endpoint and do not overlap, then they create a cycle of length 2k. This gives the following theorem. :Theorem (Bondy and Simonovits, 1974). There exists some constant C such that \\\\operatorname{ex}(n,C_{2k})\\\\le Cn^{1+\\\\frac{1}{k}} for every positive integer n and positive integer k\\\\ge2. A powerful lemma in extremal graph theory is dependent random choice. This lemma allows us to handle bipartite graphs with bounded degree in one part: :Theorem (Alon, Krivelevich, and Sudakov, 2003). Let G be a bipartite graph with vertex parts A and B such that every vertex in A has degree at most r. Then there exists a constant constant C (dependent only on G) such that \\\\operatorname{ex}(n,G)\\\\le Cn^{2-\\\\frac{1}{r}}for every positive integer n. In general, we have the following conjecture.: :Rational Exponents Conjecture (Erd≈ës and Simonovits). For any finite family \\\\mathcal{L} of graphs, if there is a bipartite L\\\\in \\\\mathcal{L}, then there exists a rational \\\\alpha \\\\in [0,1) such that \\\\operatorname{ex}(n,\\\\mathcal{L})=\\\\Theta(n^{1+\\\\alpha}). A survey by F√ºredi and Simonovits describes progress on the forbidden subgraph problem in more detail. = Lower bounds = For any graph G, we have the following lower bound: :Proposition. \\\\operatorname{ex}(n,G)\\\\ge cn^{2-\\\\frac{v(G)-2}{e(G)-1}} for some constant c. :Proof. We use a technique of the probabilistic method, the \\"method of alterations\\". Consider an Erd≈ës‚ÄìR√©nyi random graph G(n,p), that is, a graph with n vertices and between any two vertices, an edge is drawn with probability p, independently. We can find the expected number of copies of G in G(n,p) by linearity of expectation. Then removing one edge from each such copy of G, we are left with a G-free graph. The expected number of edges remaining can be found to be \\\\operatorname{ex}(n,G)\\\\ge cn^{2-\\\\frac{v(G)-2}{e(G)-1}} for some constant c. Therefore, at least one n-vertex graph exists with at least as many edges as the expected number. For specific cases, improvements have been made by finding algebraic constructions. :Theorem (Erd≈ës, R√©nyi, and S≈ës, 1966). \\\\operatorname{ex}(n,K_{2,2})\\\\ge \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{2}-o(1)\\\\right)n^{3/2}. :Proof. First, suppose that n=p^2-1 for some prime p. Consider the polarity graph G with vertices elements of \\\\mathbb{F}_p^2-\\\\\\\\{0,0\\\\\\\\} and edges between vertices (x,y) and (a,b) if and only if ax+by=1 in \\\\mathbb{F}_p. This graph is K_{2,2}-free because a system of two linear equations in \\\\mathbb{F}_p cannot have more than one solution. A vertex (a,b) (assume b eq 0) is connected to \\\\left(x,\\\\frac{1-ax}{b}\\\\right) for any x\\\\in \\\\mathbb{F}_p, for a total of at least p-1 edges (subtracted 1 in case (a,b)=\\\\left(x,\\\\frac{1-ax}{b}\\\\right)). So there are at least \\\\frac{1}{2}(p^2-1)(p-1)=\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{2}-o(1)\\\\right)p^3=\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{2}-o(1)\\\\right)n^{3/2} edges, as desired. For general n, we can take p=(1-o(1))\\\\sqrt{n} with p\\\\le \\\\sqrt{n+1} (which is possible because there exists a prime p in the interval[k-k^{0.525},k] for sufficiently large k) and construct a polarity graph using such p, then adding n-p^2+1 isolated vertices, which do not affect the asymptotic value. :Theorem (Brown, 1966). \\\\operatorname{ex}(n,K_{3,3})\\\\ge \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{2}-o(1)\\\\right)n^{5/3}. :Proof outline. Like in the previous theorem, we can take n=p^3 for prime p and let the vertices of our graph be elements of \\\\mathbb{F}_p^3. This time, vertices (a,b,c) and (x,y,z) are connected if and only if (x-a)^2+(y-b)^2+(z-c)^2=u in \\\\mathbb{F}_p, for some specifically chosen u. Then this is K_{3,3}-free since at most two points lie in the intersection of three spheres. Then since the value of (x-a)^2+(y-b)^2+(z-c)^2 is almost uniform across \\\\mathbb{F}_p, each point should have around p^2 edges, so the total number of edges is \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{2}-o(1)\\\\right)p^2\\\\cdot p^3=\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{2}-o(1)\\\\right)n^{5/3}. However, it remains an open question to tighten the lower bound for \\\\operatorname{ex}(n,K_{t,t}) for t\\\\ge 4. :Theorem (Alon et al., 1999) For t\\\\ge (s-1)!+1, \\\\operatorname{ex}(n,K_{s,t})= \\\\Theta(n^{2-\\\\frac{1}{s}}).  Generalizations  The problem may be generalized for a set of forbidden subgraphs S: find the maximal number of edges in an n-vertex graph which does not have a subgraph isomorphic to any graph from S.Handbook of Discrete and Combinatorial Mathematics By Kenneth H. Rosen, John G. Michaels p. 590 There are also hypergraph versions of forbidden subgraph problems that are much more difficult. For instance, Tur√°n's problem may be generalized to asking for the largest number of edges in an n-vertex 3-uniform hypergraph that contains no tetrahedra. The analog of the Tur√°n construction would be to partition the vertices into almost equal subsets V_1, V_2, V_3, and connect vertices x,y,z by a 3-edge if they are all in different V_is, or if two of them are in V_i and the third is in V_{i+1} (where V_4=V_1). This is tetrahedron-free, and the edge density is 5/9. However, the best known upper bound is 0.562, using the technique of flag algebras.

Kerlew was built in 1906 at Stockton-on-Tees, England, by Craig, Taylor and Company, Ltd.Shipbuilding on the River Tees Prior to World War I, she served as the Austro-Hungarian commercial cargo ship Virginia. She was named Kerlew and owned by Kerr Navigation Corporation of New York City by the time the United States Army acquired her on a bareboat charter basis in October 1917. The U.S. Navy acquired Kerlew on 13 November 1918, two days after the end of World War I, at Cardiff, Wales, assigned her the naval registry Identification Number (Id. No.) 1325, and commissioned her the same day as USS Kerlew with Lieutenant S. V. Kalhauge, USNRF, in command. Assigned to the U.S. Army coal trade at Cardiff, Kerlew transported coal across the English Channel from British to French ports. She continued this duty until 29 January 1919, when she arrived at Invergordon, Scotland, to load a cargo of American naval mines for return to the United States. Departing Invergordon on 19 February 1919, she arrived in the United States at Norfolk, Virginia, on 9 March 1919. Kerlew was decommissioned on 12 April 1919 and transferred the same day to the United States Shipping Board for simultaneous return to her owner. Kerlew returned to commercial service. She was renamed Mount Sidney in 1922 while serving as a merchant ship.

An enormously wealthy man, the Baron used his wealth to maintain one of the more notable and lavish Parisian salons, which soon became an important meeting place for philosophes and their guests, and where Diderot recruited at least a few of the contributors to the Encyclop√©die. Meetings were held regularly twice a week, on Sundays and Thursdays, in d'Holbach's home in rue Royale, butte Saint-Roche. Visitors to the salon were exclusively males, and the tone of discussion was both lively and quite philosophical, extending to topics more extensive and generally more candid and more earnest than those of other salons. Few subjects were taboo, and sharp disagreements were welcomed.For an in-depth discussion of d'Holbach's \\"coterie\\", see Alan Charles Kors, D'Holbach's Coterie: An Enlightenment in Paris (Princeton University Press, 1976) On every Thursday and Sunday, twelve guests--not always the same--would meet at the salon from two o'clock to seven or eight at night. Regulars at the salon included Diderot, Helvetius, d'Alembert, Raynal, Boulanger, Morellet, Saint-Lambert, Marmontel; and, occasionally, Buffon, Turgot, and Quesnay. Others who attended the salon included Rousseau, Abbe Galiani, Le Roy, Duclos, Venel, Barthez, Rouelle, Roux, and Suard. Foreigners in Paris would try to get an invitation to the salon due to its fame; in due course the salon was frequented by Hume, Sterne, Garrick, Horace Walpole, Franklin, Priestly, Adam Smith, Beccaria, and Gibbon.

There are actually two villages named Rissiana in this area; Rissiana Kalan (Bara Rissiana) and Rissiana Khurd (Chota Rissiana). Both have the same village number (138 GB) and are located two kilometers apart. Rissiana used to be called Case Garh, and this name is still used in many official documents. The below details represents the demographics of Rissiana Khurd. Before the partition of sub continent in 1947, The village of Rissiana existed with Sikh majority. Rana Atta Muhammad is considered to be the pioneer immigrant who arrived here with his family from Sosana village of district Hushiarpur Indian Punjab. Sosana was a very small village but it has generated very prominent figures who contributed a lot for the development of Pakistan like Dr. Muhammad Saleem Khan and his son Rana Ayyaz Saleem (Senior Superintendent Police), Dr. Iqrar Ahmad Khan (SI), Vice Chancellor of University of Agriculture (Faisalabad) and Waseem Afzal (Central Superior Services of Pakistan) officer. Education and Major Figures of Rissiana The literacy rate is about 75% and the younger generation is much committed for higher education for which they have to travel to big cities. The major educated personalities of this village include Lieutenant Colonel (R) Dr. Abdul Latif, Rana Faryad Hussain (Retired Associate professor of English at Government degree College Samundri), Rana Khalid Jamil Sohail (Pakistan Air Force), Dr. Abdul Rehman (Nuclear Institute of Agriculture and Biology), Rana Abaid Ur Rehman Working at Standard Chartered Bank Pakistan Limited as Manager Foreign Trade , Mr. Rana Mahmood khan (ex General Manager Gojra Samundri sugar mill), Mr. Abdul Razzaq (Assistant Professor of Zoology at Government Degree College Samundri), Mr. Ghulam Qadir (Retired Assistant Vice President, Allied Bank of Pakistan), Mr. Habib Jilani (Executive District Officer Finance), Dr. Abdul Qayyum (State Bank of Pakistan), Col.

Two young men offered blood in 1971 war against India therefore this village is also called the village of SHUHADA (martyr people) Economy The economy of Rissiana is mainly based upon agriculture. The land of Rissiana is very fertile, but the subsoil water is brackish, forcing farmers to rely upon a meager canal supply which is meager. For this reason, Rissiana has seen a major decline in agriculture. However, sufficient wheat, maize, sugarcane, guavas, Kinnow, jaman, and fodder are produced here. These crops both satisfy the local needs and are sold in the grain market of nearby Samundri. The younger generations of Rissiana increasingly leave the area and move to cities to find employment and higher education opportunities. The area around Rissiana is irrigated by a distributary of British-built Canal 'Gogera Branch' that is also abbreviated as GB. Hence, the official number of village is 138 GB. Ethnic makeup Nearly all the inhabitants of Rissiana Khurd migrated to Punjab, India. Majority, people belonging to major castes are living in this village. These three castes include Rajput, Jutt, and Gujjar. Besides the majority of Muslims inhabitants, there are also living a few Christians in the village. Infrastructure Rissiana has one primary school for boys and one middle school for girls, paved roads, telephone and power lines, four mosques and a filtration plant for the supply of clean drinking water. The towers of various mobile operators are located in Rissiana which help the local people to remain in touch with their beloved ones.

It is a standalone novel set in the distant future, and it chronicles the journey of Quillon, a pathologist forced into exile. The Gollancz hardcover edition of the book was published in March 2010 in the United Kingdom. The Ace Books hardcover edition was published in June 2010 in the United States. Setting The novel is set in an unspecified distant future. Human civilization is largely confined to the city of Spearpoint, home to more than 30 million people. Spearpoint (colloquially called the Godscraper) is built on the surface of a vast artificial spire made of a nameless, nearly impermeable black substance. Both Spearpoint and its surroundings are divided into zones: regions of space-time that exist at different energy states. Different zones support different levels of technology, and humans require periodic drug treatments to survive outside their native zone. Within Spearpoint itself, individual zones designate different precincts within the city; further away, they become much larger, with some on the opposite side of the world encompassing entire geographic regions. Spearpoint consists of six precincts of ascending technological advancement: Horsetown, Steamville, Neon Heights, Circuit City, the cybertowns/cyborg polities, and the Celestial Levels. Deep inside Spearpoint's spire is a theorized core, called the Mire or the Eye of God, near which the zones become exponentially smaller. Beyond Spearpoint is the Outzone, the rest of the world. The terrain is primarily a vast, sparsely forested plain crisscrossed by ancient roads, disused railways, and the semaphore towers responsible for relaying communication between Spearpoint and the towns. Bodies of water like the Long Gash and the Old Sea are rapidly receding, and the world itself is becoming colder. In this harsh land, travelers must contend with Carnivorgs, cybernetic canine-like creatures who prey on people for their brain tissue, and the Skullboys, land pirates that create havoc and anarchy for the sheer thrill of it and because of imperfect zone drugs. These are obtained from the Carnivorgs in return for victims to be robbed of their brain tissue. Opposing the Skullboys is Swarm, a conglomeration of several hundred airships that formerly served as Spearpoint's military arm, before splitting from the city over a thousand years previously. They have retained a highly militaristic way of life, though with elements of democracy, voting by flags (one per airship) on important matters. They view Spearpointers with great suspicion, possible spies and saboteurs. Other inhabitants of the Outzone they view as just inferior, apart from the Skullboys who are bitter foes. There is internal division about how best to deal with them. Plot The plot begins when an \\"angel\\", a posthuman from the Celestial levels at Spearpoint's peak, falls to Neon Heights, further down the spire. The clean-up crew that finds it delivers it to Quillon, one of the zone's pathologists. It is revealed that Quillon was part of a secret angel project to see if angels could be altered to survive in Spearpoint's lower levels. The dying angel tells Quillon that certain factions amongst the angels are searching for him to obtain further information about the results of this project. Quillon seeks advice from his old ally, Fray, who tells him that he needs to leave Spearpoint if he is to survive in the foreseeable future. He summons Meroka, one of his extraction specialists, to help Quillon out of the city. Quillon and Meroka escape the city, pursued by \\"Ghouls\\"- angels with similar, but less sophisticated, inter-zonal modifications that allow them to survive in lower state zones for short periods of time. They find out that the zones had rearranged themselves totally overnight in what is called a \\"zone storm\\". They look to Spearpoint and see that all the lights have gone out, indicating the entire city has been affected by the storm. They venture on and run into an overturned carriage with several bodies having been consumed by the vorgs, carnivorous cyborgs, that harvest brain tissue to feed on. Soon Quillon and Meroka run into a Skullboy caravan and find two prisoners who they release. The Skullboys take them all hostage, then the vorgs turn up and demand fresh meat in return for making drugs for the Skullboys. Meroka offers herself up to the vorgs but before she is harvested the vorg behind her is killed by members from Swarm. Swarm airmen kill off the remaining Skullboys and Vorg and pronounce Quillons group to be \\"clients of Swarm\\". They are taken aboard one of the hundred and fifty airships that make up the entity of Swarm. The gang get taken back to Swarm's HQ and are taken to see the leader Riccasso. Meroka finds out that Quillon is an angel and as she had a chequered past with the angels, no longer speaks to him. Ricasso tells Quillon about his research into finding a complete cure for zone sickness, which would allow people to cross zone boundaries at will. The two prisoners that Quillon and Meroka released are mother Kalis and daughter Nimcha who both bear the Tectomancer birthmark. However Kalis' birthmark upon closer inspection turns out to be a tattoo used to divert hatred and prejudice from her daughter onto herself. Quillon takes great measures to hide their identity from Swarm because they are as prejudiced as all the other outerland peoples about these \\"witches\\". Eventually Ricasso finds out and agrees to kept it from the rest of Swarm as it would cause unrest with the airmen. Quillon finds out that the serum that Ricasso had been preparing before serves as an effective anti-zonal medication. Quillon asks Ricasso and a few of his most trusted allies to head back to Spearpoint to help out the millions of needy and sick people still living there. After a tense discussion it is decided that the issue will be put to the flags to see who is for or against the idea. Surprisingly the majority say that they are behind the plans, even some of Ricasso's most staunch enemies. Preparations are made to head out to Spearpoint and the serum is prepared for dilution. When one of the scouts comes back after a successful battle with a Skullboy ship they bring back intelligence and maps that the previously dead land of the Bane has had a zone realignment and using the route could be a massive short cut. Ricasso decides that this is the best plan of action even though it is highly dangerous. In the vorg cage room where Ricasso's lab is Quillon is hard at work preparing the serum for dilution and he gets surprised by Spatha who has a gun aimed at Quillon's head. Spatha demands that Quillon release a vorg to make everyone think that bringing him aboard and letting him loose in the laboratory was a bad idea. However the vorg runs through the ship and causes mayhem, releases the other vorgs in the cages and manages to kill 4 people before Nimcha uses her powers to cause a small zone tremor so the ship is reverted to a lower state zone, killing off the highly advanced vorg. Spatha is arrested and sentenced to death by firing squad. The journey across the newly opened short cut over the Bane is uneventful at first, until they come across a metallic object in the distance. The Painted Lady, Curtana's ship on which Quillon and Meroka are living is instructed to scope out the object whilst the rest of Swarm carries on its normal course. The object turns out to be a plane, unusual because the Bane is supposedly uninhabitable by anything other than single celled organisms and dirt. Soon they come across more planes, then prop-planes then bi and tri planes until they get to gliders. Many of them are marked with a red rectangle with one large stars and four small stars. (This means nothing to them, but would be consistent with it being the flag of China in our own era.) After this they see on the horizon what appears to be a very similar object to Spearpoint, but with no signs that anyone ever lived on its surface. Ricasso and Quillon elect to take a closer look at the building in a balloon as normal airships can't reach the top of the object. They see that unlike Spearpoint this object was never colonised as thoroughly and is hollow with a hole at the top. Once they get close to Spearpoint they intercept semaphore lines that tell of zone changes on the boundary of their destination which are so low state it would inhibit powered flight. A plan is made to come in steep, nurse the engines as long as possible and finally glide into Spearpoint. This is complicated by the pockets of resistance put up by Skullboys in balloons. There is a fierce battle into which Quillon and Meroka are enlisted, many of the guns and engines fail as they cross into the lower state zones but eventually they triumph. They reach Spearpoint and land in the middle of a sea of people. They are met with Tulwar's militia force that escort Quillon and Meroka to the Red Dragon Bathhouse. They start to unload the crates of Serum-15 and a stray Skullboy rocket sets fire to the tail of the Painted Lady. Luckily most of the airmen and Curtana make it off the ship with little more than burns but some of the medicine was lost in the hurry to offload it. At the bathhouse Quillon, Meroka, Kalis, and Nimcha talk to Tulwar about the distribution of the serum and about getting Nimcha close to the Mire, inside of Spearpoint, which has been calling to her through her dreams and asking her to heal it. Tulwar agrees to let them travel to the nearest tunnel entrance and suggests that they stay the night to rest after their chaotic journey. The next day they head to the Pink Peacock and enter the tunnel system with Meroka leading them. She smells something amiss with Tulwar's plan and thinks that they are being set up so that Tulwar can remain in power of Spearpoint and prolong the chaos to reign supreme. She diverts from the planned path and they eventually get caught up by Kargas, Tulwar's head of militia, and get into a fire fight. At that point Fray and Malkin turn up with powerful guns and mow down the assailants. Tulwar had informed the party that Fray was dead but this is just another of his deceptions. After talking to Fray they get lead to meet with the Mad Machines, long thought to be an urban myth about the even more mythical tunnel systems by many living in Spearpoint. They meet with Juggernaught and plead Nimchas case and it agrees to take them to see the others. They travel along without Meroka and Malkin who leave to sort out Tulwar and meet with The Final One. She informs Nimcha that she must take a place in the chamber beside the other tectomancers so they can heal the Mire. After the party leaves Nimcha and Fray down in the chamber they decide to take revenge on Tulwar for his deceptions. They hide in crates of the serum and Meroka shoots Tulwar several times, disabling him by puncturing his steam pipes. Quillon talks to Tulwar about his deceptions then spits up blood and passes out. He has internal bleeding from a shot to his back and is on his death bed. He is informed that an angel was sent out to meet with the rest of Swarm, which had hung back before the zone boundaries, and has told them that they have allies in the celestial levels. Quillon realises that these are the same allies that warned him about his imminent execution and Curtana orders him to travel with Meroka to the Celestial Levels in hopes of saving his life and finding allies to take Spearpoint back from the Skullboys and the unallied angels. The book finishes with Curtana and Agraffe wonder what changes would befall the planet and Spearpoint after Nimcha has finished healing the mire and wonder what the Mad Machines were talking about when they mentioned Earthgate and going into the planet to reach the stars. 'Earth' While the world the story takes place on is referred to only as \\"Earth\\" throughout the novel, it is gradually revealed through anecdotes and remarks by the characters that the world Spearpoint is on is not Earth as we know it. It fits quite well with the world being a post-apocalyptic terraformed Mars that has somehow lost or confused its history. Geographical features such as the Daughters, three mountains that were \\"punched in a sloping line with the regularity of bullet holes\\", and the Mother Goddess, \\"the tallest of all mountains, so tall and wide that from its foot slopes it no longer seemed a mountain, but merely a gentle steepening of the ground\\",Reynolds, Alastair. Terminal World. Ace Books, New York City. June 2010. Pages 105-106. correspond to the Tharsis Montes and Olympus Mons, respectively. One character mentions to another character that they are traveling through a canyon system called the \\"Night Maze\\", having already passed over Long Gash. This name corresponds to Noctis Labyrinthus, which lies to the west of Valles Marineris. One character tells a story about the founding of the world's two other cities, Fortune's Landing and Soul's Rest, both known to be older than even Spearpoint. According to the story, the cities were founded by twin princes who hailed from a faraway kingdom. One brother, named Spirit, founded Soul's Rest, while the other brother, Opportunity, founded Fortune's Landing.Reynolds, Alastair. Terminal World. Ace Books, New York City. June 2010. Pages 172-173. This refers to the Mars Exploration Rover mission. The ages of characters, given in years, also imply that either they mature much more quickly than present-day humans, or that the year is much longer than 365 days (which if the planet is Mars will be the case since a Mars year is 687 Earth days). It is said that people once lived to be twice as old as now, which makes Mars such a good fit. There are also references to people in the past being similar in size to children; this could indicate that the lower Martian gravity has led all humans to be taller than their Earth-based ancestors. Several times during the novel, distant historical/mythical events are referred to as \\"before the moon split in two\\" hinting at Mars' two moons. There are references throughout the novel to the world growing colder and the air thinner, which fits with a terraformed Mars whose atmosphere isn't being maintained. One of the main characters, Ricasso, mentions that he has done calculations and that the atmosphere is \\"like a bucket with a leak in it\\".Reynolds, Alastair. Terminal World page 214 Another factor is where, toward the end of the book powerful machines which have a major part to play refer to the location as Earthgate \\"this ancient, once-dead world\\" and distinguish it from Earth itself. One character pick up partially on this, saying \\"What the hell is Earthgate anyway? Why doesn't she just say Earth and be done with it?\\" Reynolds, Alastair. Terminal World page 473 At one point in the text, Mars is explicitly referenced as visible in the night sky, just before one of the two halves of the moon appears. In an interview Reynolds confirmed that the story is set on Mars.Interview with Reynolds on June 3, Fantasticon, Copenhagen Development Reynolds announced on April 30, 2008 that he was writing a new novel which he described as \\"SF ... weird, and it doesn't have spaceships\\". He elaborated further in an interview in early 2009, saying that Terminal World was a steampunk-influenced novel about \\"the last human city, a vast vertical structure called Spearpoint\\", a city divided into several semi-autonomous \\"zones\\" of differing technological levels. The story focuses on the adventures of Quillon, a pathologist forced into exile from Spearpoint, and involved a \\"terrible catastrophe\\" befalling the city. A diagram showing the plotting of the novel's structure was featured on his website in an article describing his writing methods. Reviews have compared the novel to Vernor Vinge's Zones of Thought series, which also takes place in a universe split into areas where different levels of technology are possible. Reynolds has described the novel as being influenced by Arthur C. Clarke's The City and the Stars, which is also set on a world where most of the population is confined to one city, as well as films depicting dystopian and post- apocalyptic worlds such as Delicatessen, Dark City and Mad Max. Reynolds has repeatedly said in interviews and on his website that although he did consider incorporating Terminal World's material into a series while planning it, the novel is complete in its own right and he does not anticipate writing a sequel. In 2013, Reynolds published on his blog three scenes in Quillon's life originally planned for the novel but cut in the later stages of editing. Reception Eric Brown reviewed the book for The Guardian and concluded \\"The novel works as a rousing adventure in a wildly original setting, and Quillon's transformation from cold loner to caring human being is effectively charted.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Category:2010 British novels Category:2010 science fiction novels Category:Novels by Alastair Reynolds Category:Victor Gollancz Ltd books Category:American science fiction novels ","title":"Terminal World"},{"id":"21683131","text":"Lee Mingwei (Chinese: ÊùéÊòéÁ∂≠; born 1964) is a Taiwanese-American contemporary artist currently living and working in Paris, France and New York, USA. Lee Mingwei creates participatory installations, where strangers can explore issues of trust, intimacy, and self-awareness, and one-on-one events, where visitors contemplate these issues with the artist through eating, sleeping, walking and conversation. Lee's projects are often open-ended scenarios for everyday interaction, and take on different forms with the involvement of participants and change during the course of an exhibition. His work has been exhibited in museums worldwide including The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, Mori Art Museum in Tokyo, and Centre Pompidou in Paris, among others. Lee's mid-career survey exhibition \\"Lee Mingwei and His Relations\\" was conceived by the Mori Art Museum (2014), and traveled to Taipei Fine Arts Museum (2015) and Auckland Art Gallery Toi o TƒÅmaki (2016), with a European survey exhibition \\"Lee Mingwei: Li, Gifts and Rituals\\" at Gropius Bau in 2020. He has participated at \\"Viva Arte Viva,\\" The 57th International Art Exhibition - La Biennale di Venezia, curated by Christine Macel, and has been featured in biennials in Venice, Lyon, Liverpool, Taipei, Sydney, Whitney, and Asia Pacific Triennials.  Education  Lee studied at California College of Arts, earning a BFA in Textiles in 1993. During his time in university he was particularly influenced by two professors, Mark Thompson and Suzanne Lucy, who expanded his understanding of art. Following his undergraduate studies, Lee continued on to Yale University where he earned an MFA in sculpture in 1997.  Work  Lee's work focuses on the formation and contemplation of human relationships. His pieces typically involve situations that invite participants to reflect upon on their connections with others, or prompt them to create new connections with strangers. His work is often linked to Relational Aesthetics, a term coined by French art critic Nicolas Bourriaud to denote art that creates situations or environments that invite viewer engagement. Curators and writers have also contextualized such themes within Lee's work by referencing American artists Allan Kaprow and John Cage, who created work dealing with an audience's relationship to its environment. For his survey exhibitions, Mami Kataoka further proposes an Eastern context of connection and interconnectivity in association with Lee's work. = The Sleeping Project and The Dining Project = Lee's work also focuses on daily life, and involves staging everyday activities such as sleeping and eating within the museum space. For The Sleeping Project (2000‚Äìpresent) Lee or a host from the museum stages the act of \\"sleeping with\\" by placing two beds and several nightstands within the museum. For each of the days, museum visitors are selected through lottery to spend a night in the museum sleeping in one of two beds alongside with their host. Participants are asked to bring objects from the space where they usually sleep, and the following morning they are to leave the objects on one of the surrounding nightstands. The objects remain on the nightstands for the duration of the exhibition. Later iterations of the piece have involved two strangers sleeping in the beds, rather than Lee. In a similar work, The Dining Project (1997‚Äìpresent), Lee or a host from the museum cooks and serves a visitor a meal that they then share together within the museum. = 100 Days with Lily and The Letter Writing Project = Many of his works draw from childhood experiences and memories of his family. For 100 Days with Lily (1995) Lee draws from his time mourning the loss of his grandmother by chronicling his experience spending 100 days with a narcissus from planting, to its growth, and eventually to its death and his mourning of the flower. He documents this experience in a series of photographs, onto which he superimposes lines of text marking one moment from each of the hundred days with the flower. The passing of his grandmother also inspired The Letter Writing Project (1998‚Äìpresent) in which participants write letters to someone expressing something they wish they had expressed before. Participants leave their letters within wooden booths Lee created for participants to write inside. If the participants mark the recipient's address, the museum mails out the letters, and retains the ones without addresses. = The concept of Gift = Lee also explores the concept of the gift in his work, drawing particular inspiration from Lewis Hyde‚Äôs book The Gift: Creativity and the Artist in the Modern World. In 2009, for La Biennale de Lyon, Lee created The Moving Garden (2009 - present), a piece consisting of a granite slab from which visitors may take flowers. The visitors are then meant to bring the flower out of the museum, diverge from the path they would normally take, and along the way give the flower to a stranger. In The Mending Project (2009 - present), a mender is seated at a long table with two chairs against a wall of colorful spools of thread. Participants are invited to bring in something they would like to have mended or embellished, while they sit across from the mender and talk. After the mending, the visitors can then choose to take away their garment, or leave it at the gallery so that it may be attached to the spools on the wall, and return to collect it at the conclusion of the exhibition. In Sonic Blossom (2013 - present), participants are gifted a song. Classical singers approach a single museum-goer and ask if they would like to receive a gift. If the participant agrees, the singer leads them to a seat and begins to perform one of Franz Schubert‚Äôs Lieder. Lee was inspired to create the piece while helping his mother to recover from surgery, during which time the two would listen to Schubert‚Äôs Lieder. The presentation of Sonic Blossom at The Metropolitan Museum of Art was selected as ‚ÄúThe Best Classical Music of 2015‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Best in Art of 2015‚Äù in the New York Times.  Retrospectives  Lee Mingwei and His Relations = In 2014, the Mori Art Museum held a retrospective of Lee's work titled \\"Lee Mingwei and His Relations: The Art of Participation.\\" The show was curated by Mami Kataoka, Mori's Chief Curator, and included a survey of Lee's work spanning 20 years, as well as work by other artists such as Yves Klein, John Cage, Allan Kaprow, and Rirkrit Tiravanija to contextualize Lee's practice. Kataoka highlighted the relevance of Lee's work in light of the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami as well as the importance of holding such an exhibition in Japan: ‚ÄúIn Japan today, with all of its loss, Lee Mingwei‚Äôs efforts have released similarly positive energy towards rebuilding relationally and bringing connectedness into our awareness. While they also mean embracing an awareness of loss, the special experiences Lee creates call strongly on our senses and emotions and help us take our first steps toward becoming conscious of new relationality.‚Äù Following its run in the Mori Art Museum, in 2015 Lee's retrospective traveled to the Taipei Fine Arts Museum, and subsequently to the Auckland Art Gallery Toi o TƒÅmaki in 2016.

It is known to occur mainly in the soft tissues and dermis. Rare forms were thought to occur in the gastrointestinal tract before they were discovered to be different and redesignated as GNET. Recurrence is common. It has been associated with both EWSR1-ATF1 and EWSR1-CREB1 fusion transcripts. Clear cell sarcoma of the soft tissues in adults is not related to the pediatric tumor known as clear cell sarcoma of the kidney.Poppe B, Forsyth R, Dhaene K, Speleman F. Soft tissue tumors: Clear cell sarcoma. Atlas Genet Cytogenet Oncol Haematol. November 2002. Signs and symptoms It presents as a slow growing mass that especially affects tendons and aponeuroses and it is deeply situated. Patients often perceive it as a lump or hard mass. It causes either pain or tenderness but only until it becomes large enough. This kind of tumor is commonly found in the extremities especially around the knee, feet and ankle. Patients diagnosed with clear cell sarcoma are usually between the ages of 20 and 40. Pathology Despite the name clear cell sarcoma, the tumor cells do not necessarily need to have clear cytoplasm. The lesion has a distinctly nested growth pattern with a mixture of spindle, epithelioid and tumor giant cells. Approximately two thirds of the tumors contain melanin pigment. Clear cell sarcoma, similar to melanoma, has consistent positivity for S-100, HMB-45, and MITF. Diagnosis Imaging studies such as X-rays, computed tomography scans, or MRI may be required to diagnose clear-cell sarcoma together with a physical exam. Normally a biopsy is also necessary. Furthermore, a chest CT, a bone scan and positron emission tomography (PET) may be part of the tests in order to evaluate areas where metastases occur. Treatment Treatment depends upon the site and the extent of the disease. Clear cell sarcoma is usually treated with surgery in the first place in order to remove the tumor. The surgical procedure is then followed by radiation and sometimes chemotherapy. Few cases of clear cell sarcoma respond to chemotherapy. Several types of targeted therapy that may be of benefit to clear cell sarcoma people are currently under investigation. Prognosis When the tumor is large and there is presence of necrosis and local recurrence, the prognosis is poor. Presence of metastasis occurs in more than 50% cases and the common places of its occurrence are the bone, lymph node and lungs. Five-year survival rates, which are reported to be between 50-65%, can be misleading because the disease is prone to late metastasis or recurrence. Ten and twenty-year survival rates are 33% and 10%, respectively.

It aired on February 23, 2009.  Plot  A 13-year-old boy named Jackson collapses after playing in a basketball game. He is admitted to Princeton- Plainsboro Teaching Hospital, mainly because of his genetic mosaicism (46, XX/XY); when he was born, it was found that half the cells in his body are male and the other half female. The parents decided to raise their child as male and lately began giving him testosterone, disguised as \\"vitamins\\". After a variety of tests, nothing is found, but Jackson suffers fluid build-up in his pericardium and his palms turn red. Meanwhile, Cuddy, Wilson, and the team are all puzzled when House appears to be in an especially good mood. He took the case from Cuddy without a fight, has done clinic duty without incident, and even indulged the parents' wishes of performing a pointless test. In the middle of the diagnosis, House is found apparently asleep, but the team discovers he is not breathing. Foreman resuscitates him by twisting his nipples, but House shrugs off the incident as an accidental vicodin overdose. A search of Jackson's room reveals a poem he wrote, which leads the team to believe that he is depressed and suicidal. Thirteen, who has been sympathizing with Jackson, forces the parents to tell their son the truth about his genetic condition, which greatly upsets him. While speaking with Jackson, however, Thirteen realizes her mistake when she learns that the poem was written as a school assignment. After an apparent break-up which was an act to keep their jobs, Foreman and Thirteen realize Taub and Kutner know they are still together. However, they all find out that House, surprisingly, has failed to notice this. Foreman, along with Wilson, begins to suspect House has been high from heroin use. Wilson tests House by offering him a drink, but House defiantly finishes the drink. When Wilson confronts House, who is inducing himself to vomit out on the street, House confesses that he has been on methadone and that the leg pain completely disappeared. Cuddy is nonetheless upset that House is taking a dangerous drug, but she is dismayed when House quits his job after being given a choice between his job and his medication. When Jackson vomits blood, the diagnosis reaches systemic scleroderma, which is very difficult to treat. However, Thirteen notices that the treatment seems to be working too quickly. House returns when Cuddy agrees to provide methadone prescriptions, and solves the case. It is revealed that Jackson was dehydrated when he collapsed, since his kidney function was impaired by the large amount of energy drinks he had before the game. When House agreed to an MRI upon the parents' request, the injected contrast was not filtered out by the kidneys and damaged multiple tissues, causing all the symptoms. Jackson is to be cured with dialysis, and he reconciles with his much-relieved parents. In the end, Cuddy gives House his regular dose of methadone, but House refuses to take it. He insists that the lack of pain and his brighter mood interfered with him doing his job, but Cuddy accuses him of simply being afraid of change. House leaves his office with his cane after throwing the medicine in the garbage can.  Music  *The song that plays while House is shaving for his interview is \\"$300\\" by Soul Coughing, from the album El Oso.

The findings were suppressed by the United Nations and involved governments for political reasons, and its existence was denied. No final written report was ever completed, though purported early written documentation has been leaked. The validity of Gersony's purported findings continue to be disputed.  Research  Robert Gersony, a freelance American consultant who had extensive experience in war zones in Africa, particularly Mozambique and Somalia, was hired by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to conduct a refugee survey in preparation for encouraging Rwandans who had fled the country in the wake of the Rwandan genocide and rebel victory in the Rwandan Civil War to return home. Gersony and his assistants began the work broadly sympathetic to the new government of the mostly-Tutsi Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), as was common among those who saw the effects of the genocide.Footnotes by G√©rard Prunier based on personal interview of Gersony conducted in 1998. . In the course of their fieldwork, the three-person team became convinced that the RPF had carried out \\"clearly systematic murders and persecution of the Hutu population in certain parts of the country.\\" The team were granted free travel by the RPF, who expected the refugee study to help their efforts to repatriate refugees, and saw more of the country and talked to more people than any other foreigners in Rwanda at that time. Specifically, between 1 August and 5 September 1994 the Gersony team visited 91 sites in forty-one of the 145 communes of Rwanda, mostly in the areas of Kibungo, Gisenyi and Butare. They further gathered information on about ten other communes and carried out interviews in nine refugee camps in surrounding countries. Over the course of their work, the team conducted more than two hundred individual interviews and conducted another one hundred small group discussions. Purported findings of the team include the alleged 2 August massacre of about 150 civilians attempting to cross back into northwest Rwanda from Zaire by the RPF, as well as systematic arrest and apparent forced disappearance of a large number of men in Gisenyi. In Butare, part of Kigali, and Kibungo to the south and southeast, the team reported indiscriminate massacres of civilians who had come to meetings convened by local government authorities, house-to-house killing of civilians, organized searches to kill civilians who were hiding in the brush, and ambushes of civilians attempted to flee across the border into Burundi. The report concluded that \\"the great majority of these killings had apparently not been motivated by any suspicion whatsoever of personal participation by victims in the massacres of Tutsi in April 1994.\\" Gersony's personal conclusion was that between April and August 1994, the RPF had killed \\"between 25,000 and 45,000 persons, between 5,000 and 10,000 persons each month from April through July and 5,000 for the month of August.\\"  Findings reported  Gersony reported his findings to Madame Sadako Ogata, UNHCR High Commissioner, who in turn informed Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali. Boutros-Ghali sent then-Assistant Secretary General Kofi Annan and UNHCR Africa director Kamel Morjane to Kigali. Upon his arrival, Annan and several subordinates were briefed by Gersony, who stated that he recognized that his conclusions were opposite to that otherwise found by the UN but that he was willing to stake his 25 year reputation on its validity. The UN officials and Gersony then had a meeting with Minister of the Interior Seth Sendashonga, Minister of Foreign Affairs Jean Marie Vianney, and Prime Minister Faustin Twagiramungu, who stated that it would be impossible for the government to kill 30,000 people secretly, that it was unlikely that the RPA would travel with hoes, machetes and clubs as contended in the report, and that the President himself had gone to investigate reports of RPA atrocities along the Tanzanian border and had found no evidence and concluded that Hutu extremists in the Tanzanian camps were inciting fear in the refugee population.ICTR-98-41-T Defense Exhibit DK-112, October 14, 1994 Outgoing Code Cable MIR from Shaharyar Khan to Kofi Annan regarding Gersoni (sic) \\"Report\\", (admitted Nov. 16, 2006) http://www.rwandadocumentsproject.net/gsdl/collect/mil1docs/index/assoc/HASHc166/6f755cde.dir/doc84106.PDF Shaharyar Khan, UN Special Representative to Rwanda, who was present at the meeting with the government officials, would express his belief that an elevated level of revenge killings had occurred in border regions but that, \\"I do not accept Gersoni's conclusion that the killings are part of a 'pre- ordained, systematic massacre ordered from the top.'\\" Annan expressed his belief that killings were ongoing but that he hoped the killings were not deliberate and promised the officials that the UN would embargo Gersony's findings to give the new government a chance to gain control of the situation. General Guy Tousignant, head of the UN Assistance Mission for Rwanda, was more blunt to other ministers he later met, informing them that Gersony was probably correct and that the killings must stop. In the meantime, UNHCR, who had commissioned the report, stopped its repatriations of refugees back into Rwanda. The contents of Gersony's findings were leaked to the international press, infuriating the RPF government.\\"Rwanda Asks U.N. to Probe New Atrocities\\", New York Times, September 24, 1994. Great Lakes historian G√©rard Prunier writes that the UN promised the Rwandan government that they would embargo the document and instructed Gersony to never discuss their findings.\\"[Annan] also promised that the UN would embargo the document to give the new government a chance to stabilize. The report was indeed embargoed: its very existence was denied and Gersony was instructed never to talk about it publicly. ...My own uneasiness with the Gersony Report spurred me into some direct research when I went back to Rwanda for the first time after the genocide in January 1995. It was unfortunately not very difficult to find massacre witnesses, even if one had to go through a wall of lies.\\" Alison Des Forges, Rwanda expert for Human Rights Watch and publisher of some of the key materials on the 'Gersony report', goes further in writing that Gersony was told to not write a report and that his entire team was told to keep silent about their findings.\\"In New York, Boutros-Ghali ensured that there would never be a written document to call into question the efficacy of the U.N. presence or the behavior of the Rwandan forces. Gersony was told to write no report and he and his team were directed to speak with no one about their findings.\\" . A three and a half-page memorandum was drafted for internal use, from which a two-and-a-half page memo was prepared for the special rapporteur on Rwanda of the UN Human Rights Commission. When the special rapporteur attempted in April 1996 to learn more about Gersony's findings, he received the reply, \\"We wish to inform you that the 'Gersony Report' does not exist. [emphasis in original]\\" Gersony himself has kept his word to never publicly discuss his findings, resulting in the 'Gersony Report' achieving \\"an almost mythical dimension.\\" In 2006, Lieutenant Colonel Thomas P. Odom, a former US military attache in Rwanda, sharply disputed the 'Gersony Report', asserting that no report was ever produced, that no UN officers had ever corroborated Gersony's account and that subsequent investigative visits had not confirmed its findings. Odom stated of two prominent Rwanda experts, \\"Even authors I respect enormously such Alison des Forges and G√©rard Prunier go too far in lending credence to these accusations,\\" and characterized the relevant work done by Des Forges as \\"largely hyperbolic guesswork built on doubtful sources.\\"Lieutenant Colonel Thomas P. Odom USA (ret.),, Small Wars Journal Volume 5, July 2006, pp. 6‚Äì7. Former Canadian Intelligence Officer, Dr. Phillip Drew, who was also tasked to follow up on some of the contents of the Gersony report, agrees with Odom. Noting that his team included forensic entomologists, Drew reported that while bodies were found in some of the locations identified by Gersony, close inspection of several locations around Kibungo concluded that the bodies had been in place since mid-April to early May 1994. Thus claims that stated the RPF was conducting mass murder in these locations in August could not be substantiated. Dr. Phillip Drew -personal papers>. In September 2010, a website released what is claimed to be an internal UN written summary of the oral presentation made by Gersony, as well as several field reports made by his team during the course of their research.

Ultrastructural studies typically reveal an intermembrane distance in the order of the size of a single protein, as small as 10 nm or wider, with no clear upper limit. These zones of apposition are highly conserved in evolution. These sites are thought to be important to facilitate signalling, and they promote the passage of small molecules, including ions, lipids and (discovered later) reactive oxygen species. MCS are important in the function of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), since this is the major site of lipid synthesis within cells. The ER makes close contact with many organelles, including mitochondria, Golgi, endosomes, lysosomes, peroxisomes, chloroplasts and the plasma membrane. Both mitochondria and sorting endosomes undergo major rearrangements leading to fission where they contact the ER. Sites of close apposition can also form between most of these organelles most pairwise combinations. First mentions of these contact sites can be found in papers published in the late 1950s mainly visualized using electron microscopy (EM) techniques. Copeland and Dalton described them as ‚Äúhighly specialized tubular form of endoplasmic reticulum in association with the mitochondria and apparently in turn, with the vascular border of the cell‚Äù. Plasma membrane - endoplasmic reticulum contact sites MCSs between ER and PM exist in different cell types from neurons to muscle cells, from Homo sapiens to Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Some studies showed that more than 1000 contact sites are present in every yeast cell and the distance between the lipid bilayer ranges from 10 to 25 nm (the order of the size of a single protein). PM-ER contact sites have been linked to the main functions of MCS: lipid synthesis, lipid trafficking, and calcium homeostasis. A set of molecular tools (e.g., LiMETER and MAPPER) have been developed to label and manipulate the formation of ER-PM junctions in living cells. =Lipid biosynthesis= The uneven distribution of sterols among the membranes of the cell organelles, depends largely on non-vesicular route of transfer. For instance, in the ER, where they are synthetised, they account for about the 5%, but they are far more concentrated in the PM, where they account for more than 30% of lipid content. Because lipids are insoluble in water (for example sterols <100 nM), and the spontaneous interbilayer and transbilayer lipid movement has halftime ranging from 1-2 h up to 103 h, it is generally accepted that the lipid trafficking must be mediated by lipid transfer proteins (LTPs) alongside the vesicular trafficking, which is not a major route for sterols. Several families of LTPs have been identified: they can carry the lipid molecule shielding its lipophilic chains from the aqueous ambient of the cytosol. OSBP is the most extensively studied member of the oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) related proteins family (ORP). It was first described as the cytoplasmic receptor for 25-hydroxycholesterol, and after more than 20 years it was shown that it's a cholesterol regulated protein in complex with ERK. Now, after the description of the structural basis for sterol sensing and transport, ORP protein family members are known to be essential for sterol signalling and sterol transport functions. Their peculiar structure is characterized by a conserved Œ≤-barrel sterol-binding fold with additional domains that can target multiple organelle membranes. In yeast, Osh4 is an OSBP homologue the crystal structure of which, obtained in both the sterol-bound and unbound states, showed a soluble Œ≤-barrel protein with a hydrophilic external surface and a hydrophobic pocket that can carry a single sterol molecule. Seven OSBP homologues (OSH proteins) have been identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, in which their role has been suggested to be more relevant to sterol organization in the PM, rather than sterol trafficking from ER. Furthermore, Stefan et al. showed that OSH proteins control PI4P metabolism via the Sac1 Phosphatidylinositol (PI) 4-phosphatase. They also proposed a mechanism for Sac1 regulation: high Phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) levels on the plasma membrane recruit Osh3 at PM-ER contact sites through its pleckstrin homology (PH) domain; Osh3 is now active and can interact with the ER-resident VAP proteins Scs2/Scs22 through its FFAT motif (two phenylalanines on an acidic tract), ultimately activating ER-localized Sac1 to reduce PI levels. The VAMP-associated proteins (VAPs) are highly conserved integral ER membrane proteins involved in different cellular functions. They localize to the ER, and their ability to interact with multiple lipid-transfer, lipid-binding or lipid-sensing proteins containing the FFAT motif, suggests that VAPs have a role in lipid transport at the MCSs. Scs2 interacts with Osh1, Osh2 and Osh3. Different VAPs may be the partners at contact sites between different organelles. =Calcium homeostasis= PM-ER contact sites have a well known role in the control of calcium dynamics. The major intracellular pool of calcium is the ER and its release may be triggered by different stimuli. In excitable cells the coupling between PM depolarization and the release from the intracellular pools is essential to generate the Ca2+ signalling. In muscle cells, at the triad, junctophilin, an integral ER membrane protein, is involved in ER-PM contact stabilization by interacting with PIPs in the PM. In these contact sites, voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCCs) activate closely apposed ryanodine receptors expressed on the ER to trigger calcium release during excitation-contraction coupling. However, calcium levels need to be tightly controlled in all cell types. Non-excitable cells regulate calcium influx through PM calcium channels by sensing luminal ER calcium levels (the Calcium Release Activated Channels). ORAI1 is a molecular component of the CRAC, and it interacts with STIM1 an ER protein. STIM1 can rapidly translocate to a PM-ER contact site after depletion of the ER stores. Mitochondria - endoplasmic reticulum contact sites Contact sites between the Outer mitochondrial membrane and the ER is present in many organisms . About 100 of these contact sites exist between the ER and Mitochondria per Yeast cell. The fraction of ER that co-purifies with mitochondria, the so-called Mitochondria- associated endoplasmic reticulum membrane (MAM) has been extensively studied during the last decade. In the \\"MAM hypothesis\\" it has been proposed that at the centre of the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's Disease resides the disorder of ER-mitochondrial contact sites rather than Amyloid plaques or Neurofibrillary tangles. =Lipid biosynthesis= The presence of enzymes involved in phospholipid biosynthesis in MAM fraction is known since the 1970s, and the synthesis of some phospholipid is completed in both organelles. For instance, the biosynthetic pathway of phosphatidylcholine involves different steps some on the ER and some on the inner mitochondrial membrane. Connerth et al. identified Ups1 as a yeast LTP that can shuttle phosphatidic acid (PA) between mitochondrial membranes: they showed that effective lipid transfer required the interaction of Ups1 with Mdm35 to convert phosphatidic acid into cardiolipin in the inner membrane. Furthermore, they suggested the existence of a regulatory feedback mechanism that limits the accumulation of cardiolipin in mitochondria: high cardiolipin concentrations have the final results to inhibit its synthesis and the mitochondrial import of PA. Another study by Lahiri et al. has demonstrated that loss of contacts between the ER and mitochondria results in severe reduction in mitochondrial biosynthesis of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) due to reduction in transport of phosphatidylserine (PS), which is the precursor for PE synthesis.

They are in the Melanesia subregion and bioregion of Oceania. The archipelago forms much of the territory of Solomon Islands, while the northwestern islands are within the Autonomous Region of Bougainville, in eastern Papua New Guinea. It forms the eastern boundary of the Solomon Sea. Geography The Solomon archipelago consist of over 1000 islands, ranging from low-lying coral atolls to mountainous High islands, including many volcanoes with varying degrees of activity. Bougainville Island is the largest in the archipelago, with an area of 9,300 km2 (3591 sq miles). Mount Balbi on Bougainville is the highest peak in the archipelago at 2,715 m. =Geology= The Solomon archipelago was formed by the convergence of the Indo-Australian and Pacific Plates. The Indo-Australian Plate and the smaller Solomon Sea Plate are subducting beneath the Pacific Plate along the New Britain‚ÄìSan Cristobal oceanic trench, which runs south of and parallel to the archipelago in the Solomon Sea.Holl, Heinz-Gerd. (2013). Geology of the Solomon Islands and Geological Fieldwork Savo Island, April 2013. 10.13140/RG.2.2.18448.00001. The surface geology of the islands is mostly igneous rocks, outcrops of metamorphic rocks, alluvial lowlands, and uplifted coral islands. Areas of ancient coralline limestone are found on Bougainville.Wikramanayake, Eric; Eric Dinerstein; Colby J. Loucks; et al. (2002). Terrestrial Ecoregions of the Indo-Pacific: a Conservation Assessment. Washington, DC: Island Press Active and dormant volcanoes are found in an arc extending from Bougainville in the north through the New Georgia Islands and Savo Island to Gallego volcano on the northwest end of Guadalcanal. =Climate= The climate of the islands is tropical; however, temperatures do not greatly fluctuate due to the heat sink of the surrounding ocean. Daytime temperatures are normally and at night. From April to October (the dry season), the southeast trade winds blow, gusting at times up to or more. November to March is the wet season, caused by the northwest monsoon, and is typically warmer and wetter. Cyclones arise in the Coral Sea and the area of the Solomon Islands, but they usually veer toward Vanuatu and New Caledonia or down the coast of Australia. EcologyTerrestrial= The natural vegetation of the Solomon archipelago consists of lowland and tropical forests. The major plant communities include coastal strand, mangrove forests, freshwater swamp forests, lowland rain forests, and montane rain forest. Seasonally-dry forests and grasslands are found on the northern (leeward) slopes of Guadalcanal. The islands are home to 47 native mammal species, including bats, murid rodents, and possums, gliders, and cuscuses. 26 species are endemic or near-endemic ‚Äì 17 species of bats, and nine species of murid rodent. 199 bird species are native to the Solomon archipelago, of which 69 species are endemic. =Freshwater= On the larger mountainous islands in the archipelago, numerous streams and short rivers run from the mountains to the sea, cutting deep valleys. The freshwater fishes of the Solomon archipelago have not been well studied, but there are likely four endemic species of freshwater fish in the islands - two species of genus Sicyopterus, one of Lentipes, and one of Stenogobius. The Otomebora mullet (Planiliza melinopterus) is endangered.\\"Solomon Islands\\". Freshwater Ecoregions of the World: A global biogeographical regionalization of the Earth's freshwater biodiversity.\\" feow.org. Accessed 31 March 2020. =Marine= The Solomon archipelago has a rich and diverse marine life, including coral reefs and seagrass meadows. The archipelago is part of the Coral Triangle, the region of the western Pacific with world's greatest diversity of corals and coral reef species. The Solomons have 494 species of coral, and 1019 species of reef fish. Dugongs are found in the seagrass meadows and near-shore waters.Green, A., P. Lokani, W. Atu, P. Ramohia, P. Thomas and J. Almany (eds.) 2006. Solomon Islands Marine Assessment: Technical report of survey conducted May 13 to June 17, 2004. TNC Pacific Island Countries Report No. 1/06. HistoryPrehistory= It is believed that Papuan-speaking settlers began to arrive around 30,000 BCE from New Ireland. It was the furthest humans went in the Pacific until Austronesian speakers arrived c. 4000 BCE, also bringing cultural elements such as the outrigger canoe.Kirch, Patrick Vinton (2002). On the Road of the Winds: An Archaeological History of the Pacific Islands. Berkeley, California: University of California Press. It is between 1200 and 800 BCE that the ancestors of the Polynesians, the Lapita people, arrived from the Bismarck Archipelago with their characteristic ceramics. Most of the languages spoken today in the Solomon Islands derive from this era, but some thirty languages of the pre-Austronesian settlers survive (see East Papuan languages). =European period= The first European to visit the islands was the Spanish navigator √Ålvaro de Menda√±a de Neira, coming from the Viceroyalty of Peru to the Spanish East Indies in 1568. The people of Solomon Islands had engaged in headhunting and cannibalism before the arrival of the Europeans.\\"From primitive to postcolonial in Melanesia and anthropology\\". Bruce M. Knauft (1999). University of Michigan Press. p.103. Missionaries began visiting the Solomons in the mid-19th century. They made little progress at first, because \\"blackbirding\\", the often brutal recruitment and relocation of labourers for the sugar plantations in Queensland and Fiji, led to a series of reprisals and massacres. In 1885 the Germans declared a protectorate over the northern islands, to form the German Solomon Islands Protectorate. The evils of the labour trade prompted the United Kingdom to declare a protectorate over the southern islands in June 1893, the British Solomon Islands Protectorate. In 1900, under the Treaty of Berlin, the Germans transferred a number of their Solomon Islands to the British Solomon Islands Protectorate. The remaining German Solomon Islands, at the extreme northwest of the archipelago, were retained by Germany until they fell to Australia early on in World War I. After the war the League of Nations formally mandated those islands to Australia along with the rest of German New Guinea, becoming Australian New Guinea. During World War II, the Territory of Papua and the Mandated Territory of New Guinea were within the Australian New Guinea Administrative Unit (1942‚Äì1946). After the war the Australian Territory of New Guinea was administered separately from the neighbouring Territory of Papua until the year 1949 when the two territories were formally united into the Territory of Papua and New Guinea. =Independence= The Territory of Papua and New Guinea became independent from Australia in the year 1975 as the modern state of Papua New Guinea. The Autonomous Region of Bougainville of Papua New Guinea was established in the northern Solomon Islands in 2000. Following the independence of neighbouring Papua New Guinea from Australia in 1975, the British Solomon Islands gained self-government in 1976. Independence for the Solomon Islands nation was granted on 7 July 1978. Demographics The population of the Solomons is mostly Melanesian, although minority Polynesian and Micronesian communities exist. There has also been a large influx of Chinese immigrants. =Language= Around 60 to 70 languages are spoken in the Solomon Islands. Many Melanesian languages (predominantly of the Southeast Solomonic group) and Polynesian languages are native to the area. Immigrant populations speak Micronesian languages. English is an official language in both areas of the archipelago. There are three families of Papuan languages native to the archipelago: the North Bougainville languages, South Bougainville languages, and the Central Solomon languages. =Religion= The predominant religion on the islands is Christianity, with the largest denomination being the Anglican Church of Melanesia. Governance Governance of the Solomon Islands archipelago is split between the state of Solomon Islands and the Autonomous Region of Bougainville in Papua New Guinea. Both countries are constitutional monarchies and Commonwealth realms. In a 2019 referendum, over 98% of voters supported independence. Bougainville leaders have started negotiating independence terms with the government of Papua New Guinea.

At serial number 9001 a larger engine was introduced, as well as a few other minor improvements. The D15 had a fuel capacity for gas and diesel, and a capacity for LP gas. 17,434 units were built during their production from 1960 to 1969, with a price of $3,000 in 1967. D17 150px October 1957, the D-17 was introduced, followed by the D10 and the D12 in 1959, in which year Allis-Chalmers made as many as 50 model configurations of the D10, 12, 14, and 17. The D17 was made in gas, diesel, and LPG versions, its 226-cubic- inch engine turned 1,650 rpm, and was tested at 52.6 belt and 46 drawbar horsepower. 62,540 D-17s were produced during their 10-year run. The diesel D17 had a six-cylinder engine with 262 cubic in. and weighed about 4,660 pounds. D10 160px The D10 replaced the Model B and were not made with narrow front-ends. Their wide front ends were adjustable. Both models (D10 and D12) were tested at 28.5 belt and 25.8 drawbar horsepower and had 138.7 cubic- inch engines; the only difference between the two was that the D12 had longer front-axle sleeves and a wider front axle adjustment for wider rows. 5,304 D10s were made from 1959 to 1967. D12 1966 D 12 series II The D12 replaced the Model CA in 1959. 4,070 D12's were made in their 10-year run from 1959 to 1968. The D12 had a 138.7-cubic-inch, four-cylinder, 31-horsepower gasoline engine that was tested in Nebraska at 29.43 drawbar horsepower. D19 200px The D19 was introduced in 1961 to suit the needs of larger farmers. It was the first D-series tractor besides the diesel D17 to have a six-cylinder engine. Its horsepower was: 71.54 gas; 66.19 propane, and 66.92 diesel. Its displacement was 262 cubic inches. The diesel model was the first in the industry to come standard with a turbocharger, boosting both horsepower and fuel economy. 10,591 units were built, and they weighed 6650 to 6840 pounds. The D19 was manufactured until 1964. D19s were known for running smoothly and fairly quietly. The D19 was popular among larger farmers in the 1960s, who had a higher acreage to manpower ratio than ever before. The D19 was able to pull a five bottom plow. It also came in a high-crop version with over three feet (37 inches) of ground clearance. D21 The D21 was introduced in 1963, and was the largest of the D series, as well as the first Allis-Chalmers tractor to exceed 100 horsepower and the largest row crop tractor available in the industry; rated at 103 horsepower with a 7.0 liter engine. The D21 was styled significantly different than the other D series with full fenders, a large platform, and a rear-mounted fuel tank which held , allowing an average of 10 hours of field work. The D21 was not turbocharged until 1965, which pushed its horsepower up to about 128 as it remained the largest row crop tractor available. This gave the D21 over 15,000 pounds of pull, making it the largest tractor Allis-Chalmers had ever made, as well as the most expensive at around 10,000 dollars. Before this move to turbo, the D21 series I found itself outmoded by the Allis-Chalmers 190XT, which could be turned up to produce more power than the D21. The D21 was replaced in 1970 by the model 220, also with a 7 liter engine, which was rated at 130 horsepower. The D21 was a favorite for tractor pullers and still makes good showings at the pulls today.

It was one of four corps in the ARVN, and it oversaw the Mekong Delta region of the country. The Mekong Delta was the heartland of agricultural South Vietnam, it encompassed the fertile alluvial plains formed by the Mekong River and its main tributary, the Bassac River. With its sixteen provinces, the Delta contained about two-thirds of the nation's population and yielded the same proportion in rice production. The terrain of IV Corps differed radically from other regions. Flat and mostly uncovered, it consisted of mangrove swamps and ricefields crisscrossed by an interlocking system of canals, natural and artificial. Except for some isolated mountains to the west near the Cambodian border, few areas in the Delta had an elevation of more than above sea level. During the monsoon season, most of the swampy land north of Route QL-4, generally called the Plain of Reeds, was inundated, especially when alluvial waters raised the level of the Mekong River from July to October. Other undeveloped swampy areas along the coast had turned into havens that sheltered Viet Cong (VC) main force units just as the scattered bases inland offered good refuge for local guerrillas. The 7th Division based in M·ªπ Tho was a part of the IV Corps, and due to the division's close proximity to the capital Saigon was a key factor in the success or failure of the various coup attempts in the nation's history. In the coup attempt of 1960, the loyalist Colonel Hu·ª≥nh VƒÉn Cao used the 7th Division to storm into Saigon to save President Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Di·ªám. In 1962, Diem decided to split the command of the area in the south around Saigon into two, the former III Corps area being reduced in size to cover the area northeast of Saigon, and the newly created IV Corps taking over the west and southwest. Cao was promoted to general and assumed command of the new IV Corps Tactical Zone, which included the area of operations of his 7th Infantry Division. ARVN forces under the control of IV Corps consisted of three infantry divisions, two mobile and six border ranger groups. In addition, the territorial forces of MR-4 totaled about 200,000, by far the most numerous among the four military regions. The 7th Division was headquartered at ƒê·ªìng T√¢m Base Camp in Dinh Tuong Province; the 9th Division was located in Sa ƒê√©c and the 21st Division usually operated in the C√† Mau Peninsula from its headquarters at B·∫°c Lieu. Despite the substantial combat support and significant advisory effort, both military and civilian, provided by the United States, primary responsibility for the combat effort in IV Corps had always been Vietnamese, even during the period when U.S. units operated in the Mekong Delta. Central Office for South Vietnam's Resolution No. 9 disseminated in 1969, emphasized the strategic importance of the Mekong Delta and conceived it as the principal battlefield where the outcome of the war in South Vietnam would be decided, the PAVN/VC infiltrated the 1st Division Headquarters and its three regiments, the 88th, 101D and 95A into IV Corps. This effort succeeded despite heavy losses. IV Corps forces were thrown off- balance and the pacification effort declined as a result of extensive PAVN/VC attacks and shellings. Not until after the PAVN/VC's sanctuaries beyond the border had been destroyed during the Cambodian Campaign and their capability to resupply from the sea eliminated were these 1st Division forces compelled to break down into small elements and withdraw. Part of these elements fell back into bases within IV Corps; others retreated toward Cambodia. IV Corps was therefore able to regain the initiative during 1971. Its efforts during the year consisted of continuing operations on Cambodian soil to assist the weaker Khmer National Armed Forces and interdicting PAVN/VC supply routes into the Mekong Delta. Concurrently, it also emphasized the elimination of PAVN/VC's bases in the Delta. In addition, they also established a new system of outposts to maintain government control over what had been the PAVN/VC's long-established base areas. The most significant achievements during this period were the neutralization of the extremely heavy enemy fortifications of Base Area 400 in the That Son (Seven Mountains) area by the 9th Division, the continued destruction of Base Area 483 in the U Minh Forest by the 21st Division, the coordinated activities of the 7th Division and territorial forces in Base Area 470 on the boundary of Dinh Tuong and Kien Phong Provinces, and finally, the successful pacification campaign in Kien Hoa Province, the cradle of VC insurgency. As a result of these achievements, the situation in IV Corps was particularly bright by early 1972. About 95% of the Delta population lived in secure villages and hamlets. Rice production had increased substantially and education was available to every child of school age. Prospects for the Delta's future looked promising as key government programs such as Land-to-the-Tiller and Hamlet Self-Development were gaining momentum. The four-year Community Defense and Local Development Plan that the government had initiated in March 1972 presaged an even brighter future for the farmers of the Mekong Delta. On 3 May 1972 Corps' commander Lieutenant General Ng√¥ Quang Tr∆∞·ªüng, was appointed commander of I Corps and Major General Nguy·ªÖn Vƒ©nh Nghi assumed command of the Corps.

During his lifetime, he witnessed his homeland change from its German origins to Polish. He studied law, philosophy, and art history at the University of Freiburg and in Berlin. On completion of his studies he joined the German civil service and worked for the Ministry of the Interior prior to serving in the German Foreign Office during World War I. Perls married his first wife Kaethe in 1910.Perls, K: \\"1910\\", page viii. Royal Art Of Benin, The Perls Collection, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1992.  Early career  Perls began collecting artwork in 1914 and was working as a professional art dealer by 1921. He established the Kaethe Perls Gallery in Berlin and collected and sold the works of many famous artists, particularly impressionists, including Edvard Munch, Pablo Picasso, Claude Monet, Vincent van Gogh, and Paul C√©zanne, among others. A portrait was painted of Perls and his wife Kaethe by Munch in 1913. In 1931, Perls moved back to Paris because of the rise of Nazi Germany. He engaged himself in scholastic activities studying the works of Plato in their original Greek and also the works of Goethe and Kant. Following this research he was himself inspired to compose several articles regarding Plato, his philosophy and aesthetics. These pieces were published in a number of French philosophical journals and he went on to give lectures on Plato at the Sorbonne. His first book: L'Art et la Beaut√© vus par Platon was published in 1938 as a result of his scholastic research.  Later life  Perls immigrated to the United States in 1941 during World War II and lived in Manhattan, the same year that he married his second wife the Swedish writer Eug√©nie S√∂derberg (1903‚Äì1973). The Perls Galleries in New York City had been established by his son Klaus Perls in 1937 and during this time Perls may have assisted his son in the acquisition of artwork. In 1939, the Frank Perls Gallery was opened by his eldest son in southern California and Perls briefly lived in Italy and traveled in Europe to further study collections of paintings after World War II. A third son, Thomas A. Perls, a physicist, was born to Hugo and Kaethe in Berlin in 1923. Following World War II and until his death, Perls concentrated on writing and publishing. Most of his works concerned Plato and his philosophy and their conceptual application to the judgment and appreciation of art. His most significant work Platon: sa conception du kosmos was originally published in 1946. This book was republished in German twenty years later and based on Perl's studies, while living in Paris, of Plato's original writings. His published works included the discussion of aesthetics and the relationship between beauty and art although Die Kom√∂die der Wahrheit (The Comedy of Truth) also featured other topics such as German intellectualism and the growth of Antisemitism.Rise of Antisemitism. After Perls's wife Eug√©nie died in New York City in 1973 he was married for a third time, to writer Monica Schall. Hugo Perls died in New York in 1977.

This would then open the possibility of proceeding east to the coastal plains, splitting South Vietnam in two. The highlands offensive was preceded by NLF diversionary operations that opened on 5 April in coastal B√¨nh ƒê·ªãnh Province, which aimed at closing Highway 1, seizing several ARVN firebases, and diverting South Vietnamese forces from operations further west. The North Vietnamese were under the command of Lieutenant General Hoang Minh Thao, commander of the B-3 Front.

Arrayed against them in II Corps were the South Vietnamese 22nd and 23rd Divisions, two armored cavalry squadrons, and the 2nd Airborne Brigade, all under the command of Lieutenant General Ngo Du. It had become evident as early as January that the North Vietnamese were building up for offensive operations in the tri-border region and numerous B-52 strikes had been conducted in the area in hopes of slowing the build-up. ARVN forces had also been deployed forward toward the border in order to slow the PAVN advance and allow the application of airpower to deplete North Vietnamese manpower and logistics.

The situation for the South Vietnamese in Military Region 1 had regained some stability after the defeat of a three-division PAVN push during late 1974. By early the following year, Military Region 1 fielded three infantry divisions (the 1st, 2nd and 3rd), the elite Airborne and Marine Divisions, four Ranger Groups and the 1st Armored Brigade (established in 1969 to parent all the armored cavalry regiments in the MR). Until mid-March, the North Vietnamese had limited their offensive operations to attempts to cut Highway 1, the main north/south line of communication, between Hu·∫ø and Da Nang and between Da Nang and Chu Lai. To confront the South Vietnamese, PAVN Brigadier General L√™ Tr·ªçng T·∫•n had amassed a force of the crack 2nd, 304th, 324B, 325C and 711th Divisions and nine independent infantry regiments, three sapper regiments, three armored regiments, twelve anti-aircraft and eight artillery regiments. Initial phase of PAVN offensive in I Corps At a meeting in Saigon on 13 March President Thi·ªáu was briefed on the military situation by Tr∆∞·ªüng and another corps commander. Thi·ªáu then laid out his plan for national consolidation. As Tr∆∞·ªüng understood it, he was free to redeploy his forces to hold the Da Nang area.South Vietnam's second largest city was to be held due to possible future exploitation of offshore oil deposits.

Tr∆∞·ªüng was shocked to discover, however, that the Airborne Division was to be removed to III Corps (unknown to Tr∆∞·ªüng at the time, the Marine Division was also already earmarked for redeployment with both units then forming a new national reserve). General Tr∆∞·ªüng was recalled to Saigon on 19 March to brief Thi·ªáu on his withdrawal plan. The general had developed two contingency plans: The first was predicated on government control of Highway 1, which would be utilized for two simultaneous withdrawals from Hu·∫ø and Chu Lai to Da Nang; The second course presupposed PAVN interdiction of the highway and called for a withdrawal into three enclaves: Hu·∫ø, Da Nang, and Chu Lai. This was to be only an interim measure, however, since the forces that withdrew to Hu·∫ø and Chu Lai would then be sea-lifted to Da Nang by the navy. The president then stunned the general by announcing that he had misinterpreted his previous orders:Dougan and Fulghum, pp. 68‚Äì69. The old imperial capital of Hu·∫ø was not to be abandoned. Making matters worse, Tr∆∞·ªüng discovered that his force was to be reduced by the removal of the Airborne Division.

It was part of the IV Corps, which oversaw the Mekong Delta region of the country. History The Division was originally established as the 4th Field Division and redesignated as the 7th Infantry Division in 1959.}} On 8 July 1959 a Viet Cong (VC) attack on a Division camp at Bien Hoa killed two U.S. advisers, Major Dale R. Buis and Master Sergeant Chester M. Ovnand, among the first Americans killed in the Vietnam War. The Division was based in M·ªπ Tho, and due to the division's close proximity to the capital Saigon was a key factor in the success or failure of the various coup attempts in the nation's history. As a result, the loyalty of the commanding officer of the division was crucial in maintaining power. In the coup attempt of 1960, the loyalist Colonel Hu·ª≥nh VƒÉn Cao used the Division to storm into Saigon to save President Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Di·ªám. In 1962, Diem decided to split the command of the area in the south around Saigon into two, the former III Corps area being reduced in size to cover the area northeast of Saigon, and the newly created IV Corps taking over the west and southwest. Cao was promoted to general and assumed command of the new IV Corps Tactical Zone, which included the area of operations of his 7th Infantry Division. Command of the 7th was given to Cao's chief of staff, Colonel B√πi ƒê√¨nh ƒê·∫°m. The Division scored the biggest successes of the military campaigns of 1962, killing along with the paramilitary and Civil Guard and Self Defense Corps, more than 2,000 VC fighters and leaving thousands of others cut off from supplies. However, South Vietnamese officers were often reluctant to absorb heavy casualties. On several occasions, Cao's forces were in an excellent position to trap and wipe out whole battalions of VC, but he would fail to close the trap on one pretext or another and allow the enemy to escape. This behavior initially mystified the division's US adviser Lieutenant Colonel John Paul Vann, who directed much of the unit's activity, who was attempting to build Cao into an aggressive commander. Unknown to Vann, Diem would reprimand or demote any officer who lost too many men, no matter how successful the operation. Diem was more interested in using the military to protect his regime than to take on the VC. His solution was to fill the ARVN with Catholic political cronies and friends like Cao, L√™ Quang Tung and T√¥n Th·∫•t ƒê√≠nh, who had little military ability, but were very likely to help stop a coup attempt. After a skirmish on a highway that resulted in a small number of South Vietnamese casualties along with several trucks destroyed, Cao was called to Saigon and reprimanded by Diem. Upon his return, Vann and his group of advisers were forced to end the joint planning sessions that had been so successful earlier, and action essentially wound down in their region. Cao used the excellent military intelligence network they had developed to find areas devoid of VC, and planned operations only in those areas. In many other cases, operations were executed on paper only, in order to report an increasing tempo of operations that did not actually exist. On 2 January 1963 the Division's 11th Regiment took part in the Battle of Ap Bac, a disastrous operation to trap a small VC force. In the successful coup of November 1963, the plotters managed to have the Division transferred temporarily to III Corps, with Diem unaware that III Corps commander T√¥n Th·∫•t ƒê√≠nh was with the rebels. ƒê√≠nh then placed a rebel subordinate in command of the Seventh Division, preventing the rest of Cao's IV Corps from saving Diem. By the end of 1965 the US advisers to the Division regarded Division commander Col. Nguy·ªÖn Vi·∫øt Thanh as an aggressive commander who demanded \\"clear, correct and frank\\" reports from his subordinates and who had a \\"sound tactical sense of the war.\\" In 1967 Civil Operations and Revolutionary Development Support (CORDS) advisers found the Division's battalions charged with area security missions were more concerned with their own static defenses than with protecting nearby villages and hamlets or with chasing the local VC. Assessing General Thanh they found that \\"his personal cautiousness and reluctance to push the battalions [those in securing missions] into more offensive activities... difficult to understand,\\" claiming that he discouraged the initiative and aggressiveness of his subordinates.\\" CORDS chief Robert Komer agreed and in 1968 described Thanh as unaggressive, unimaginative, and \\"rather a xenophobe.\\" All Komer's assistants noted worsening command and control problems at the lower tactical levels and a general confusion over the Division's roles and missions. Tactical advisers, they reported, claimed that the army units contributed little more that their \\"presence\\" to local security; were idle most of the time; and, when aroused, were content with \\"merely chasing the VC and showing the flag.\\" Despite all the revolutionary development training, the regular troops were also back in the old \\"chicken- stealing business,\\" foraging for food and living off the local peasantry.\\" From 12 September to 7 October 1967 the Division participated in Operation Coronado V with the US Mobile Riverine Force (MRF) against the VC 263rd Battalion in ƒê·ªãnh T∆∞·ªùng and Ki·∫øn H√≤a Provinces. The 7th Division lost 6 killed, while the VC lost 163 killed. From 15‚Äì19 November 1967 the Division participated in Operation Kien Giang 9-1 with the ARVN 9th Division and the 5th Marine Battalion and the MRF against the VC 263rd Battalion's Base Area 470 in western ƒê·ªãnh T∆∞·ªùng Province. The operation rendered the 263rd Battalion combat ineffective. From 7 March to 7 August 1968 the Division participated in Operation Truong Cong Dinh with the MRF to reestablish South Vietnamese control over the northern Mekong Delta in the aftermath of the Tet Offensive. The operation killed 343 VC. Following the withdrawal of the US 9th Infantry Division from South Vietnam in July 1969, MACV reported that the Division's performance had gone steadily downhill. At the time, five of its twelve infantry battalions were under the direct control of various Province chiefs, and most of the remainder were scattered about performing static security missions. As these troops hastily occupied the evacuated American facilities at ƒê·ªìng T√¢m Base Camp and elsewhere, they had little opportunity to familiarize themselves with the local enemy and terrain. Because of delays in the formation of new territorial units, the Corps' commander also continued to hold the Division responsible for its existing area security missions. Thus, despite additional aviation support and the rapid activation of 34 new RF companies, the Division was spread extremely thin, and its offensive capability dropped accordingly. President Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Thi·ªáu and III Corps commander General Thanh, tried to rectify the situation in January 1970 by sending Col. Nguy·ªÖn Khoa Nam, an Airborne brigade commander, to head the Division. Nam had earned a good military reputation in the airborne force and was credited with making remarkable progress with the Division. Fortunately for the South Vietnamese, PAVN/VC activity remained low in the Delta during late 1969 and 1970, as it did throughout South Vietnam, and the ineffectiveness of the Division had no immediate repercussions. US Corps-level advisers believed that its shortcomings could be easily remedied or, at least for the time being, balanced by the increasing mobility of the neighboring 9th Division, which General Thanh had withdrawn from its area security missions and began using it as the Corps' reaction force. During 1971 the Division and territorial forces focused on destruction of PAVN and VC Base Base Area 470 on the boundary of ƒê·ªãnh T∆∞·ªùng and Kien Phong Provinces. During the Easter Offensive in southern Cambodia and the Mekong Delta the Division conducted operations against PAVN units in the Elephant's Foot () area of Cambodia before returning the South Vietnam to counter PAVN/VC attempts to cut Route QL- which connected the Delta ricebowl to Saigon. By the end of 1972, the Division, with headquarters at ƒê·ªìng T√¢m near My Tho, was responsible for Kien Phong, Kien Tuong, ƒê·ªãnh T∆∞·ªùng and Go Cong Provinces. A major problem facing the Division was security in densely populated ƒê·ªãnh T∆∞·ªùng Province which was the key to control of National Highway 4 (now National Highway 1A), the important line of communication leading to Saigon and it contained the major city of My Tho. It was also the focus of two major enemy infiltration corridors from Cambodia. One, Corridor 1A generally paralleled the boundary between Kien Phong and Kien Tuong Provinces into the key PAVN/VC base, the Tri Phap, at the junction of Kien Phong, Kien Tuong, and Dinh Tuong Provinces. The other, Corridor 1B, came out of Cambodia's Svay Rieng Province and entered ƒê·ªãnh T∆∞·ªùng Province and the Tri Phap through the Plain of Reeds in Kien Tuong Province. Two enemy divisions opposed the Division. The PAVN 5th Division with three regiments: the 275th, the 174th and the E6, had fought in the Easter Offensive campaign in the Binh Long battles of April through June 1972, then moved to the Mekong Delta and campaigned in Kien Tuong, Kien Phong and ƒê·ªãnh T∆∞·ªùng Provinces. The 6th Division was in central Dinh Tuong, its 24th Regiment was probably located east of My Tho close to the border of Go Cong Province; the 207th Regiment was in northern Kien Phong Province; and the 320th Regiment , which was probably operating as part of the 6th Division, was in southern Kien Phong. The Division, with an attached regiment of the 9th Division, had to cope with two independent regiments: the 88th and the DTI, controlled by VC Military Region 2. Although the Division had secured the vital line of communication to Saigon and the enemy's actions were limited to attacks by fire against outposts and populated areas, it had an imposing assignment. By late 1973 the Division, under the command of Maj. Gen. Nguy·ªÖn Khoa Nam, had become particularly skillful in rapid deployment, netting significant catches along the infiltration corridors. As the year drew to a close however, severe rationing of fuel, imposed to compensate for spiraling costs, drastically limited the Division's mobility. The permanent withdrawal of RF and PF from exposed positions balanced this disadvantage somewhat, in that General Nam less frequently had to dispatch troops in what were often futile but costly attempts to rescue besieged outposts; he could select areas of deployment more likely to result in combat with major units or large infiltrating groups. Employing advantages of surprise, superior mobility and firepower, including effective coordination with the RVNAF, the Division was usually the clear winner in that kind of encounter. At the end of the year the Division assumed responsibility for Vƒ©nh Long and Vƒ©nh B√¨nh Provinces from the 9th Division and returned the 14th Regiment to the 9th Division. From 12 February to 14 May 1974 the 12th Regiment and two battalions from the 10th Regiment together with units from the 9th Division participated in the Battle of Tri Phap attacking a PAVN base area in ƒê·ªãnh T∆∞·ªùng Province before PAVN forces arrived there. In April 1974 during the Battle of Svay Rieng the Division moved a forward command post into M·ªôc H√≥a and was controlling the operation of two task forces then committed in the Elephant's Foot () area of Cambodia. One was composed of the 15th Infantry, 9th Division and part of the 16th Armored Cavalry Squadron; the other included the 10th Infantry and elements of the 6th Armored Cavalry Squadron, in 12 days of fighting in the border area, these two mobile task forces killed 850 PAVN soldiers, captured 31, collected over 100 weapons, and suffered fewer than 300 casualties, including 39 killed. On 9 April 1975 the PAVN 5th Division moved down from Svay Rieng Province into Long An Province attacking near T√¢n An with its 275th Regiment. The Long An territorials fought well and were reinforced from IV Corps by the 12th Regiment. Against light losses, the 2nd Battalion, 12th Regiment, killed over 100 soldiers of the 275th Regiment, forcing its commander to ask for reinforcement. The next day, the PAVN attacked the Can Dot airfield () in T√¢n An and, after closing Highway 4, were driven off with heavy losses by Long An territorials. In two subsequent days of heavy fighting, the three Long An battalions, the 301st, 322nd and 330th, accounted for over 120 PAVN killed and 2 captured. Meanwhile, the 12th Regiment, fighting two regiments of the PAVN 5th Division, killed over 350 and captured 16. During the final weeks of April VC units tried to interdict sections of Highway 4, but division forces repulsed these attacks. No attacks were launched on any district towns or provincial capitals in Dinh Tuong and other Mekong provinces. On 30 April 1975 as South Vietnamese President Duong Van Minh surrendered to the North Vietnamese, the division's units started to disintegrate, however in Cai Lay and My Tho, some units continued resistance until the morning of 1 May. Major General Nam and his deputy commander, Le Van Hung, committed suicide separately on 30 April and 1 May while Brigadier General Tran Van Hai committed suicide at Dong Tam Base on 30 April.

It strives for a society where food is not wasted and no one goes hungry. FareShare rescues food that would otherwise go to waste and cooks it into free nutritious meals for people in need. Around five million Australians experience food insecurity each year while food waste costs our economy an estimated $20 billion. FareShare tackles the tragedy head on by rescuing surplus, quality food from supermarkets, wholesalers, farmers and other businesses and cooking it into nutritious meals. In Melbourne, with the help of 1000 regular volunteers, FareShare cooks more than 6,000 free meals a day for charities such as soup vans, homeless shelters, women‚Äôs refuges and community food banks. FareShare‚Äôs new production kitchen, designed to cook up to five million meals a year, opened in Brisbane in October 2018 as part of an exciting collaboration with Foodbank. The new operation effectively doubles FareShare's social impact, bringing the daily total of cooked meals to around 12,000. FareShare is a charity and relies on the support of philanthropic foundations, businesses and individual donors to rescue food and cook meals. In 2015, FareShare commenced a kitchen garden program to supplement rescued vegetables to cook with. To date it has established kitchen gardens in Abbotsford, Moorabbin Airport and on the Baguley family farm in Clayton South, Victoria. For every $15 donated to FareShare, it can cook 20 meals for the homeless, hungry and those who have fallen on hard times. History FareShare began in 2001. Steven Kolt, a Jewish Aid Australia member, knew of the work of City Harvest, an organisation that rescues food for the needy of New York City. As a result, 'Melbourne City Harvest' began in 2001, rescuing food that would otherwise be wasted. Prepared meals were collected from function halls and catering venues. Meanwhile, 'One Umbrella' had also begun rescuing food. With RACV Foundation's support, the group cooked nutritious pies in the club's kitchen. In late 2001, Melbourne City Harvest and One Umbrella decided to merge. One Umbrella then lobbied for the creation of Victoria's \\"Good Samaritan Act\\" which provides legal protection to those who act in good faith by donating food to charities. In 2008, One Umbrella changed its name to FareShare and for the first time, opened its own kitchen in Abbotsford, Victoria.

Hong Kong Among Hong Kong Indian adolescents, Punjabi is the third most common language other than Cantonese. The Punjabis were influential in the military, and in line with the British military thinking of the time (namely, the late 19th century and early 20th century) Punjabi Sikhs, Punjabi Hindus and Punjabi Muslims formed two separate regiments. The regiments were as follows: *Punjab regiment: 25,000 soldiers (50% Muslim, 40% Hindu and 10% Sikh) *Sikh Regiment: 10,000 soldiers (80% Sikh, 20% Hindu) In 1939, Hong Kong's police force included 272 Europeans, 774 Indians (mainly Punjabis) and 1140 Chinese.

Elevations in the settlement include Big Peak (, 597 m), Br≈°ƒçice Hill (538 m), Kaliƒç Hill (601 m), Kiƒçiber Hill (also: ƒåiƒçiber, 578 m), Kilovec Hill (516 m), Staregutnik Hill (568 m), and Stra≈ænica Hill (also: Stra≈æica, 577 m).

Biography Blau was born in Bridgeport, Connecticut on June 1, 1921 to Hungarian immigrants who were residents of Manhattan's Lower East Side. He attended the City College of New York, which he left before graduating following an argument with a professor about William Shakespeare. Blau served in Europe during World War II in the United States Army Signal Corps, where he wrote poems for French journals that he had translated into French. After completing his military service, he founded the journal Masses and Mainstream and worked as a writer and in public relations. He was a ghostwriter for sports instruction booklets on behalf of basketball player Bob Cousy and baseball's Roger Maris. Together with cartoonist Roy Doty, he created The Adventures of Danny Dee, an early show for children with animation that broadcast starting in 1953 on the New York City affiliate of the DuMont Television Network.Gould, Jack. \\"ABOUT DANNY DEE; Children's Program Created by Roy Doty Is a Charming Excursion in Fantasy\\", The New York Times, December 20, 1953. Accessed February 28, 2009. Although the similarity was lost as he grew older, Blau had an uncanny resemblance to Groucho Marx, and would often be approached by fans of the comedian. Among the books he authored was The hero of the Slocum disaster, an historical novel exploring the infamous 1904 sinking of the General Slocum. He received the Edgar Allan Poe Award for the mystery novel The Keys to Billy Tillio. Jacques Brel Blau was introduced to the music of Belgian singer-songwriter Jacques Brel by his wife, Elly Stone, who had first heard Brel's music through an acquaintance at a record company. Blau became infatuated with Brel's work and started translating his songs. Some of Blau's initial work appeared in O, Oysters!, a musical revue. Together with composer Mort Shuman, Blau came up with the concept of a play that would feature a night of Brel's songs, and the two worked together to translate the songs into English and add material to wrap around the music. Jacques Brel is Alive and Well and Living in Paris featured Shuman and Stone as part of a cast of four. The play debuted at The Village Gate in early 1968 and ran for more than four years. Thereafter, it was performed by what may be thousands of theaters around the world. =Personal= Blau wrote a number of works of poetry, novels and plays, but never again achieved the success of Jacques Brel. He was never affected by the disappointments, with his son Matthew noting that he had many ideas and \\"was a man who moved on.\\" A resident of Manhattan, Blau died there at age 87 on February 17, 2009 due to pneumonia, which he contracted following a stroke. He was survived by his wife, three sons, four grandchildren and a great-granddaughter. His first marriage had ended in divorce.

She was re-elected in 2014. Morvai is not a member of Jobbik, and later supported Fidesz. Life and career Morvai was born in Budapest in 1963 to parents Kl√°ri Fekete and Mikl√≥s Morvai. After graduating from ELTE Ap√°czai Csere J√°nos High School, she went to E√∂tv√∂s Lor√°nd University of Budapest, getting a law degree cum laude. After graduation she gained qualifications to practice as a judge in Hungary, but instead of working in that capacity she went on to teach at the university, currently as an associate professor. In 1989 she was the first recipient of a British Government scholarship for students in central Europe and was presented with her award by UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher personally. She used the scholarship to study advanced law at King's College London gaining a Master of Laws degree. In 1993‚Äì1994 she taught law in the United States at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison as a Fulbright scholar.Jewish Telegraphic Agency She primarily researches the area of penal law, dealing with the retrospective administration of justice, the question of abortion, victim's rights in criminal procedure, the dignity and rights of the HIV positive, child abuse and sexual exploitation, the problem of prostitution, discrimination and domestic violence.

During the election campaign, Morvai said that if Jobbik entered parliament, it would join ‚Äúone of the eurosceptic factions which will only form in the light of the election results‚Äù. On 7 June 2009, Morvai was elected MEP (Member of the European Parliament) along with two of her colleagues on the Jobbik ticket.

Visa Int'l Serv. Ass'n is a court case in which the pornography magazine Perfect 10 filed a complaint against Visa and MasterCard for copyright infringement and trademark infringement.  Background  Perfect 10 is a pornography magazine publisher that also markets online subscriptions to www.perfect10.com. Both its magazine and its website feature copyrighted images of nude models. Perfect 10 holds federal copyrights to the photographs published in its magazine and website. Perfect 10 also holds federal trademark rights to the use of the term, \\"PERFECT 10,\\" which prohibits other websites or agencies from using the term.  Timeline of the trial  Lawsuits filed against financial institutions = Perfect 10 claimed that many websites have stolen its copyrighted images, misrepresented themselves as if they were affiliated with Perfect 10, and offered the stolen images for sale on the internet. Perfect 10 alleges that the stolen-content websites are engaged in direct copyright infringement. However, Perfect 10 did not directly sue the stolen-content websites. Instead, Perfect 10 sued the financial institutions which process credit card payments to these websites. This is similar to a past lawsuit Perfect 10, Inc. v. Google Inc. in which Google was sued for its search engine popping up results with the stolen-content websites. In this case, Perfect 10 sued Visa International, MasterCard International, and several affiliated banks and data processing services, alleging secondary liability under federal copyright and trademark law, secondary liability under California statutory and common law, and violations of California laws proscribing unfair competition and false advertising. = Initial dismissal by US District Court = Initially, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California dismissed the case. Perfect 10 appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. = Perfect 10's Appeal: Secondary Liability for Copyright Infringement = Perfect 10 appealed the district court's decision, maintaining that Defendants were guilty of contributory copyright infringement and vicarious copyright infringement. Direct infringement under the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. ¬ß 101 would apply only to the stolen-content websites. In helping these websites process payments, however, the defendants were allegedly contributing to infringement.  Contributory copyright infringement  Since contributory copyright infringement is a secondary liability and distinguishable from direct infringement, Visa could be indicted as a contributory infringer if it had knowledge of the infringing activity of the stolen-content websites, and if it induced or materially contributed to the infringement. The court found the defendants not liable for contributory copyright infringement, because payment processing services do not constitute material contribution to the direct infringement. This is the finding of the majority, although there is much dissent as to what constitutes material contribution.  Material contribution  Perfect 10 argued that Defendants had chosen to continue to process credit card payments to the infringing websites, despite having knowledge of ongoing infringement. Perfect 10 argued that the defendants induce, enable, and contribute to the infringing activity of stolen-content websites by persisting in providing payment services and facilities. Perfect 10 drew analogies from prior cases: Fonovisa, A&M; Records, Inc. v. Napster, Inc. and MGM v. Grokster. In Fonovisa, the defendant-appellee was accused of providing the \\"site and facilities\\" for infringement in the form of a swap meet that allowed infringing activity to take place on a large scale and for infringement to be profitable. The Fonovisa court held that the infringers and the swap meet providers were in a mutual enterprise of infringement, and the swap meet providers encouraged infringement, which altogether constituted material contribution and inducement. Perfect 10 argued that Visa was the cyberspace equivalent of such an illicit marketplace, and that without the material contribution of Visa's payment process system, infringement could not have happened on a large scale. The court decided that infringement rests on reproduction, alteration, display, and distribution of Perfect 10's images over the Internet. It argued that Visa and its payment processing services were not designed to reproduce or alter copyrighted images. Even if users could not pay for images with credit cards, infringement could still continue on a large scale because other viable funding mechanisms were available.  Inducement  In MGM v. Grokster, the court found that \\"one who distributes a device with the object of promoting its use to infringe copyright, as shown by clear expression or other affirmative steps taken to foster infringement, is liable for the resulting acts of infringement by third parties.\\" Perfect 10 argued that the defendants induce customers to use their credit cards to purchase goods and services from infringing websites, and are therefore guilty of inducement of infringement. The court made the distinction that the software system in A&M; Records, Inc. v. Napster, Inc. and MGM Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd. were engineered and promoted explicitly for the purpose of facilitating infringement of copyrighted music, thereby reducing legitimate sales of such music. In contrast, the defendant's system did not facilitate access to infringing websites. Again, the defendants did not use its payment process system to copy, alter, distribute, or display infringing material. Consumers did not use Visa to locate, view, or download the infringing images. Thus, the court held that infringing websites simply use the defendants' system to process payments. In addition, the court ruled that there was no evidence to suggest that the defendants engineered its payment processing system with the intent of promoting its use for infringement because its device was designed to process payment of any type of sales transacted on cyberspace. The court also held that no facts suggested that the defendants promoted their payment system as a means to infringe, so inducement could not be established.  Vicarious copyright infringement  Vicarious copyright infringement is established if Defendants have both the right and ability to supervise the infringing conduct and a direct financial interest in the infringing activity. In this case, Perfect 10 alleged that the defendants had an indirect right and ability to control the content of the infringing websites by refusing to process credit card payments to the websites. The court ruled that the defendants could block access to their payment system, but they could not block access to the Internet, and therefore could not block access to the infringing websites nor to the search engines that enabled their discovery. In other words, since the defendants could not directly supervise infringing conduct, they did not have the right and ability to control content, and vicarious infringement could not be established.  Secondary liability for trademark infringement  There are two kinds of secondary liability for trademark infringement: Contributory trademark infringement and vicarious trademark infringement. While trademark infringement is different from copyright infringement, Perfect 10's arguments in support of trademark infringement were essentially identical to those alleged in Perfect 10's copyright claims, so the court ruled they were not liable for trademark infringement. = Contributory trademark infringement = To be liable for contributory trademark infringement, the defendants would have had to have intentionally induced the primary infringer to infringe, or continued to supply an infringing product to an infringer with knowledge that the infringer is mislabeling the particular product supplied.\\" Inwood Labs., Inc. v. Ives Labs., Inc., 456 U.S. 844, 855 (1982). Perfect 10 alleged that the defendants played a critical role within the stolen-content websites' cycle of business that allowed the direct infringers to be profitable. They also claimed that the websites were using the PERFECT 10 mark in a manner likely to cause the public to believe that these stolen-content websites were authorized by Perfect 10. Perfect 10 continued by saying that Visa can choose to stop processing payments to these websites, which might have the practical effect of stopping or reducing the infringing activity. The defendant's payment processing system was not an infringing product in itself, nor was it designed to intentionally induce trademark infringement, so contributory trademark infringement was not established. = Vicarious trademark infringement = Vicarious liability for trademark infringement requires \\"a finding that the defendant and the infringer have an apparent or actual partnership, have authority to bind one another in transactions with third parties or exercise joint ownership or control over the infringing product.\\" Hard Rock Caf√© Licensing Corp. v. Concession Servs., Inc., 955 F.2d 1143, 1150. The court found that defendants only processed payments to these websites and collected their usual processing fees, which did not constitute joint ownership. It is the websites‚Äô contracts with the consumers that bind the websites to provide the infringing images, not the websites‚Äô relationship with Defendants.

Plot summary To understand this wonderful little book you have to understand the people and places that appear in the book. The book sits in a small collection of Anglo-Catholic/Catholic novels alongside, The Chalice and the Sword by Ernest Raymond. Twenty years at St Hilary by Bernard Walke. All the authors knew each other through their discovery of Catholicism via Anglo-Catholicism. One of their group being Compton Mackenzie. The names of people and places in the book are only slightly changed. The Church of St Margaret is in fact the RC Cathedral Church of St Mary in Picardy Place at the top of Leith Walk, Edinburgh. St Gabriel's Church is St Michaels, Hill Square, Edinburgh. The Reverend Denis Meaty being Father Beattie. The \\"Garden of Eden\\", a dance hall of dubious reputation was the Blue Lagoon in Picardy Place. The \\"Garden of Eden\\" is a thorn in the side of the innocent and unworldly Catholic priest Father Malachy, who is praying to God that He will close the dance hall. During an argument with a Protestant minister, in real life the Rector of St Pauls, York Place. Father Malachy claims that God could miraculously remove the \\"Garden of Eden\\". The skeptical Protestant scoffs and Father Malachy inadvertently predicts that God will indeed remove the \\"Garden of Eden\\" on a specific date. Many people, including Father Malachy's superiors, attempt to persuade him to retract his prediction. He refuses. The date comes and the building and all the people inside do indeed vanish, reappearing on Bass Rock, a small island in the Firth of Forth. This apparent miracle draws the attention of the media, politicians and scientists, all trying to find rational explanations. The Catholic Church is reluctant to officially recognize this occurrence as a miracle, fearing either a loss of control in matters of faith, or a loss of face if the disappearance of the \\"Garden of Eden\\" should turn out to be a hoax or fabrication. Meanwhile, believers from all over the world come on pilgrimage to the former location of the dance hall. Soon the site becomes a fairground, with the town‚Äôs people, entrepreneurs and journalists trying to make a profit from the miracle and the resulting sudden influx of pilgrims. This includes the sale of holy water and miniature models of the \\"Garden of Eden\\". A young woman, who was in the dance hall during the night it vanished, becomes a media star. Financial investors buy the island where the \\"Garden of Eden\\" reappeared, and construct a casino that soon attracts crowds of people. Father Malachy's Miracle book review Father Malachy is confronted with interview requests from journalists, and pilgrims beleaguer the church, hoping to meet the miracle-working priest. As he has spent most of his life in the monastery, he feels helpless in the face of the excesses of modern society. He soon regrets that he asked God for the miracle. He travels to the island and prays for a second miracle that will end the frenzy. God answers his prayer and returns the \\"Garden of Eden\\" to its original location.

During the Northern Song (960‚Äì1127) and Jin (1115‚Äì1234) dynasties, Kaifeng was an imperial capital city. The imperial palace of that time is largely lost to time, but a few parts, such as the Dragon Pavilion, remain visible today. History Qingming Scroll is believed by some to portray life in Kaifeng on a Qingming Festival day. The painting, of which several versions are extant (the above is an 18th-century copy), is attributed to the Song dynasty (960‚Äì1279) artist Zhang Zeduan. Kaifeng became the capital of the Northern Song dynasty in 960. An imperial place was built here and the city prospered, perhaps with a population reaching over 400,000. During that time the city took the name Dongjing (literally: Eastern Capital) or Bianjing.Jacques Gernet. Daily Life in China, on the Eve of the Mongol Invasion, 1250-1276. (Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 1962). Translated by H. M. Wright. . The city of that time is thought to be depicted on the famous painting Along the River During Qingming Festival. The painting by the artist Zhang Zeduan shows a typical Qingming Festival scene. The city of that time is also integral to the famous writing, Dongjing Meng Hua Lu (Dreams of Splendour of the Eastern Capital). The Jurchen-led Jin dynasty captured Kaifeng in 1127 and made the city their southern capital sometime between 1157 and 1161. The city under Jin rule was considerably smaller than it had been under the Song. The Jurchens kept their main capital further north until 1214 when they were forced to move the imperial court southwards to Kaifeng in order to flee from the Mongol onslaught. Under Yuan and Ming rule, Kaifeng ceased to an imperial capital, relegated to the level of provincial capital. The Dragon Pavilion or Wanshou Pavilion was one of the buildings of the Song imperial palace. It was destroyed and rebuilt many times throughout its long history. The current design was first built during the reign of the Kangxi Emperor during the Qing dynasty on the foundations of the old Song imperial palace. It was destroyed several times by strong storms and wars. A news magazine article from 1948 describes the Dragon Pavilion as burned during the Chinese Civil War. \\"[Henan] fell to the Communists, Kaifeng was subjected to an amount of .... Drum Tower, Dragon Pavilion, Liang High School, a part of [Henan] University and others were completely burned.\\" Heavy rainstorms and a lightning strike cause the pavilion to collapse in 1994. After each disaster, the building has been reconstructed again. Structure Games in the Jinming Pool, an early 12th- century painting depicting Kaifeng, by Zhang Zeduan. Most of the old imperial palace structures have gone today. The Dragon Pavilion remains standing within the Longting park. The Pavilion is a grand hall built on a blue brick terrace. Some 72 steps lead up to the entrance. The pavilion building is a wooden structure. It has a southern aspect with the dimensions of from east to west, from south to north, and in height. The Song Capital Street (Song Du Yu Jie) is a restored road made to look like these scene in the Qingming Scroll. It is about 400 metres long and runs southwards from entrance of Longting park. The road is lined with two story wooden buildings with tile roofs made to look like authentic Song dynasty architecture. Archeological excavation below the modern road found the remains of the old Song dynasty imperial way.

Geography Dolnji Zemon is a clustered village at the foot of Javor Hill (), which rises steeply above the Reka River and transitions into the ≈Ωabovica Plain to the northwest. The village is accessible by a secondary road from Ilirska Bistrica via Zemonska Vaga to the west, and also by a road branching off the main road from Ilirska Bistrica to Zabiƒçe. The soil is mostly loamy, and the village is surrounded by tilled fields, meadows, and pastures. Name The name Dolnji Zemon means 'lower Zemon', distinguishing the settlement from neighboring Gornji Zemon (literally, 'upper Zemon'). The village was attested in written records in 1498 as Semel. Like similar Slovene and other Slavic toponyms (e.g., Zemono, Zemun, Zempl√≠n, etc.), the name is a deadjectival noun derived from Slavic *zemƒæ—ån—ä 'earthen', referring to an earthwork fortification. History Early settlement of the area is attested by pre-Roman and Roman- era finds southeast of the village on Gradi≈°ƒçe Hill (). The remnants of a medieval castle stand northeast of the village; its owners included the Marastoni and Oldenburg families in the 17th century. The castle's last owner, at the beginning of the 20th century, was Antonietta Scribani. A water main was installed in Dolnji Zemon in 1938; prior to this drinking water was drawn from three springs in the village, which continued to be used for laundering and watering livestock after the main was installed. During the Second World War, there was an armed engagement between German forces and the Partisans' Gortan Brigade. A sawmill and grain mill operated along the Reka River, but were abandoned after the Second World War. =Mass graves= Dolnji Zemon is the site of nine mass graves or unmarked graves from the end of the Second World War.

He is the son of the Australian operatic tenor Donald Smith. Robin performed leading operatic tenor roles, including Rudolfo in La boh√®me, Turridu in Cavalleria rusticana, in many major opera houses throughout Britain, including the Sadler's Wells Opera Company Theatre and the London Coliseum Theatre, Europe (Th√©√¢tre Royal de La Monnaie), Australia (Sydney Opera House), and in Christchurch New Zealand, where he sang Florestan in the opera Fidelio for the New Zealand Broadcasting Commission, during a professional operatic career spanning over 35 years. Career Donald Robin Smith was born in , Queensland in 1942,Original Birth Certificate of Donald Robin Smith the son of the tenor Donald Smith and Thelma Joyce Lovett. Robin Donald's initial studies in music, stagecraft and languages began with the Queensland Conservatorium. A natural tenor from birth like his famous father, Robin performed in 1963 in his first opera with the Australian Elizabethan Theatre Trust Opera Company at Her Majesty's Theatre in Brisbane, in Gounod's opera Faust. He also gained some of his initial stage performing experiences, as a principal tenor with the Brisbane Gilbert & Sullivan Society and the Queensland Light Opera Company (QLOC), in the musicals Iolanthe, The White Horse Inn and No No Nanette. Robin Donald began his solo professional international operatic career in England in 1966, as a principal tenor with the Sadler's Wells Opera Company (which later became the English National Opera). Prior to this, he had studied music, acting and stagecraft with The London Opera Centre. During this time he also performed with the Opera Centre's touring company Opera For All, performing the roles of The Duke in Verdi's Rigoletto, Nemorino in Donizetti's L'elisir d'amore, and Basilio in Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro. While at the London Opera Centre, Robin also studied and sang with the New Zealand soprano Kiri Te Kanawa in their production of Cos√¨ fan tutte. After performing with the London Opera Centre's touring company 'Opera For All' for over a year, Robin then made his professional operatic debut in London with Sadler's Wells Opera Company at the London Coliseum Theatre in 1968, in the role of 'Rodolfo' in Puccini's La boh√®me. After singing and touring for some ten years as a principal tenor with Sadler's Wells, in a variety of major tenor roles, as well as performing in Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and Greece, Robin returned to Australia initially in 1973, to perform in the Australian Opera's (Opera Australia) productions for the opening of the Sydney Opera House. Here Robin sang the roles of Rinuccio in Puccini's Gianni Schicchi, and 'Walther von der Vogelweide' in Wagner's opera Tannh√§user. Robin then returned to England to fulfill contracts there with Sadler's Wells Opera, in the role of Des Grieux in Massenet's opera Manon (with Valerie Masterson), and for performances with the Welsh National Opera Company' singing the role of Rodolfo in their production of La boh√®me (with Dame Josephine Barstow as his Mimi. During his years with The English National Opera, Robin also performed the opera La boh√®me, for several seasons, with both Valerie Masterson, and Dame Anne Evans singing the role of Violetta. He then returned again permanently to Australia in 1974, with his wife Jeni and son Brent, to accept a contract with the Australian Opera Company (now Opera Australia). He performed and remained with that company singing a variety of principal tenor roles, including Rodolfo in La boh√®me, Pinkerton in Madama Butterfly, Gabriel Adorno in Simone Boccanegra (under the baton of Sir Edward Downes), Turiddu in Cavalleria rusticana (with Carlo Felice Cillario), and singing both the tenor roles of Eric and The Steersman in Wagner's The Flying Dutchman, and Alfredo in Johann Strauss's opera Die Fledermaus, for over ten years. One of Robin Donald's major tenor roles during this period included singing the role of 'Turridu' in Mascagni's opera Cavalleria Rusticana, while his father tenor Donald Smith performed his famous role as 'Canio' in Leoncavallo's opera Pagliacci on the same bill. These performances at the Sydney Opera House were acclaimed at that time, as the only known occasions when a father and son operatic tenors, had ever appeared together on the same 'double bill' in these operas, anywhere in the world. A claim that still stands today in 2016. During this period, both Robin Donald and Donald Smith also went on to perform on many other occasions together, in other operas, including Wagner's The Flying Dutchman. On these occasions, Robin sang either of the tenor roles of The Steersman or Eric). Robin and Donald also sang together in Giacomo Puccini's opera La Fanciulla del West. Throughout 1974 Donald and Robin also performed together in their famous concert series of \\"Smith & Son\\" throughout Australia and in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Adelaide.

Gelo died shortly before his father Hiero, at the age of more than 50 years. Not much is known concerning him, but he appears to have inherited the quiet and prudent character of his father. Polybius records to his praise that he sacrificed all objects of personal ambition to the duty of obedience and reverence to his parents.Polybius VII 8. It seems that Hiero awarded him by associating him to his government and that he even received the title of king.Schweighauser, ad Polybius V 88 ; Diodorus Siculus Ex. Vales XXVI. Livy asserts that, after the huge defeat suffered by the Romans at Cannae, Gelo was preparing to abandon the alliance of Rome for that of Carthage. According to this account, he began making friendly overtures to the cities allied to Rome and might have convinced the entire island of Sicily to defect to the Carthaginian side, had he not died later in the year of 216 BC. However, this seems quite at variance with the statement of Polybius of his uniform submission to his father's views and may very likely deserve as little credit as Livy's insinuation that his death occurred so opportunely, as to cast suspicion upon Hiero being the murderer of his own son.Livy XXIII 30. Gelo was married to Nereis, daughter of Pyrrhus of Epirus, by whom he left a son, Hieronymus, and a daughter, Harmonia, who was married to a Syracusan named Themistus.Polybius VII 4 ; Justin XXVIII 3 ; Pausanias VI 12,3. Archimedes dedicated to him his treatise The Sand Reckoner, in which he addresses him by the title of king.Archimedes Arenarius p. 319. ed Torell. The coins referred by earlier writers to the elder Gelon are admitted by some numismatists to belong to this prince. The head on the obverse is possibly that of Gelo himself.

Distribution Areas where the tree is native include Burma, Sumatra, Borneo, Java, Kalimantan, Malaysia, Sulawesi (Indonesia), Western New Guinea, and the Philippines. In Malaysia, G. sumatranum is known as Rhu Bukit ‚Äî with bukit in Malaysian meaning \\"hill\\". The other common she-oak species in Malaysia is Casuarina equisetifolia known as Rhu laut - laut in Malaysian means \\"sea\\" and typically it grows along the seashore on sandy substrates. In Sarawak it is a protected species (5). G. sumatranum typically grows further inland. However, when occurring in coastal regions, it provides good indication that the soil is dry and out of the littoral and inundation zone since G. sumatranum will not normally tolerate sandy or boggy soil. Description Gymnostoma sumatranum is characterised more by its multiple rounded umbrella-shaped crowns, while Casuarina equisetifolia (the most well-known member of Casuarinaceae) is typified by its equisetoid appearance. The roots have nitrogen-fixing nodules. The stems are angular or tetrahedal in cross section (2). Like the other members of the family Casuarinaceae, they are characterized by drooping equisetoid (meaning \\"to look like Equisetum\\") twigs, are evergreen, and monoecious or dioecious. The foliage of this tropical angiosperm tree looks like that of gymnosperm pine trees which typically grow in temperate climates. The stomata are not restricted to sunken grooves (2).

Korouoma is about long, few hundred metres wide and up to deep canyon at Posio, Finland. The entire area is a natural reserve. At the bottom of the canyon there's Korojoki River, which ends up to Kemijoki River. There are plenty of species in varied nature of Korouoma. Some of species found are rare. Korouoma offers great opportunities for hiking, watching the nature, fishing and reviewing the cultural history of usage of nature at the area. Korouoma is fairly popular hiking area. There is a marked hiking path at the bottom of the Korouoma and several fireplaces, huts and cabins. Finnish Administration of Forests takes care of the routes and hiking related infrastructure there. Part of Korouoma's distinctive nature are the cliffs both sides of it, where several streams freeze during the winter forming huge ice formations. Because of these ice formations Korouoma is known as the best ice climbing location in Finland. There are some climbing routes that can be used during the summer time as well. There are signs pointing to Korouoma from Rovaniemi‚ÄìPosio road (main road 81).  History  There are signs of human settlement in the area from as early as in the late 19th century. The area‚Äôs forests have been utilised for hundreds of years and the River Korojoki and its tributaries have been log floating routes. Signs of log floating are visible at the River Kurttajoki in the Koivuk√∂ng√§s area. Other signs are the remains of an old loggers¬¥ lean-to shelter by the trail leading down from Saukkovaara Hill and the remnants of an old log floating flume halfway down the River Korojoki. The area‚Äôs farmers have taken their cattle and sheep to graze in the natural meadows at the bottom of the valley. The grass in these meadows was also sometimes mowed, stored in barns and used as feed for livestock. Bears and eagles tended to prey on sheep. The foundations of old barns can still be found on the river bank. Some of the natural meadows and barns are to be restored so that future generations will be able to see them as well.  Nature  Ice fall at Korouoma. At the centre of Korouoma the fracture valley forms a gorge which has worn down and become much deeper than the surrounding terrain. The walls of the gorge are cliff faces which are tens of metres high and extremely steep. Small streams which cascade down the cliff faces freeze into icy water falls during winter. They stay frozen till late spring. The River Korojoki meanders and twists at the bottom of the canyon flowing towards the northwest. Its banks are lined by lush flood meadows and herb-rich forests. The vegetation in the northern part of the valley is lusher than in other parts of the valley indicating that the soil is calcareous. On the other hand moderately dry and dry pine mineral soil forests are the typical vegetation type in the Lapiosalmi area. The terrain around the valley is varied, marked by hilly terrain and covered with old-growth forest. Between hills there are aapa bogs and spruce-covered hanging bogs characteristic of Northern Ostrobothnia. Climbing There are at least seven named ice falls, most of them offering multiple routes, which are graded roughly between WI3 and WI6. The most obvious of these falls is the 1) Brown River (WI4/WI5), which is visible from the camping place at the bottom of Korouoma. Brown River is the highest of the falls, having up to 50 meters of ice suitable for climbing. Going up stream (left) from Brown River, one encounters 2) Mammoth (WI3), 3) Charlie (WI3/WI4), 4) Way of the Wind (WI3+/WI4) and Northern Lights (WI3+). Going down (right) from the Brown River, there‚Äôs 5) Monk cave (WI5+/WI6), which is pretty close, and then 6) Angel Fall (WI3) and 7) Wolf‚Äôs teeth, which both are much further down the Korouoma. Except for Monk Cave all of these falls are on the south side of the Koro River. In addition to these there are several such falls, that don't necessarily have names and might not be there every year. Though Korouoma is especially known for its ice climbing, there are plenty of cliffs to be climbed throughout the year.

The name Fogarty in Ireland is derived from the native Irish √ì Fogaratigh Sept who were located in County Tipperary where the name is still very prevalent to this very day. The barony of Eliogarty that still exists was named after them. This name, with variant spellings (O) Fogerty, Foggarty, Fogaty, Gogarty and Go(g)erty, is an Anglicized form of the old Irish \\"√ì Fogartaigh\\". The Irish prefix \\"√ì\\" indicates \\"male descendant of\\", plus the personal byname \\"Fogartach\\" meaning \\"banished\\" or \\"exiled\\". The Fogartys are of the ancient population group, D√°l gCais, otherwise known as the Dalcassians, who inhabited county Clare with adjacent parts of counties Limerick and Tipperary. Eliogarty, the name of a barony in Co. Tipperary, locates the sept, and indicates their importance. The majority of present-day namebearers are found in county Tipperary and Malachy O' Fogarty, of the University of Paris, who flourished in 1700, was born at Castle Fogarty in that county. Another notable namebearer was Archbishop Fogarty (1858 - 1955), who for fifty-one years was Bishop of Killaloe. A Coat of Arms granted to the family depicts two gold lions rampant on a blue shield supporting a gold sheaf of corn, the latter denoting plenty and the Harvest of One's Hopes. The first recorded spelling of the family name is shown to be that of O' Fogarty, King of Ely, County Tipperary, which was dated 1072, \\"The Annals of Ulster\\", during the reign of High King of Ireland, \\"with opposition\\", 1022 - 1166.

He belonged to the Norwegian Labour Party 1891 to 1903, and was both party leader, party secretary as well as editor of the party organ Social-Demokraten for a period. Before this he had made his mark as the defender of writer Hans J√¶ger.  Biography  Meyer was born in Borre, and was the older brother of Nanna Meyer. He graduated with the cand.jur. degree in 1882, and spent his professional life as a barrister, with access to Supreme Court cases, from 1886 to 1936. He became known as the defender of writer Hans J√¶ger in a high- profile case over censorship. J√¶ger's book Fra Kristiania-Boh√™men, published on 11 December 1885, was instantly banned by the Ministry of Justice for its indecency, and confiscated by the police. On 24 December a court order for J√¶ger was issued. In April 1886 he was sentenced to eighty days in jail and ordered to pay of costs. The sentence was appealed, and with Meyer as the defender, the jail sentence was lowered to sixty days. Politically Meyer belonged to the Liberal Party in the 1880s,S√∏rensen, 1984: p. 120 but became disenfranchised with the party during the Hans J√¶ger case, citing that by censoring the book, the Liberal Party and its associated press did not live up to its name.S√∏rensen, 1984: p. 88 In 1891 he joined the Norwegian Labour Party. He quickly rose to prominence within the young party; he became party leader in 1897, and the next year he became editor-in-chief of the party organ Social-Demokraten as well as party secretary. He was also a member of Kristiania city council. In the 1890s Meyer had become wealthy due to real estate speculation. He spent money to prop op both the party newspaper and the party itself. Some within the Labour Party saw the party as being increasingly dependent on Meyer's funding, which led to unrest. When the booming real estate market in Kristiania busted in 1899, Meyer was hit hard. His political position was also affected, and in 1900 he lost the positions as both party leader, party secretary and editor of the party newspaper. When he subsequently left the Labour Party in 1903, this was described as a \\"political suicide\\" by some. In 1923 he briefly became a member of the newly founded Communist Party Historian √òystein S√∏rensen has described Meyer's later life as \\"vagrant\\", in the figurative sense.

It was the winner of the 2002 Scotiabank Giller Prize and the 2003 Commonwealth Writers' Prize for Canada and the Caribbean region and 2003 Trillium Book Award.  Plot  The novel is a narrative by Mary-Mathilda (Miss Mary Gertrude Matilda Paul) of her confession of a crime. The events takes place in about twenty-four hours of span starting on a night in the 1950s post World War II era. She is a respected woman of the island of Bimshire, now popularly called as Barbados. She comes to the police and confronts her old friend Percy who is a Sergeant. Percy and Mary-Mathilda have feeling for each other but can never unite. She confesses of murdering Mr. Belfeels, the owner of a sugar plantation, a rich man known for his arrogance towards the workers under him. Mary-Mathilda had been working as a field labourer, kitchen help and then as a maid and since many years has been Belfeels' mistress. She has a son Wilberforce from him who becomes a doctor after being funded by Belfeels. Her son returns to the island after his studies abroad. Belfeels lives with his wife and two daughters and keeps Mary- Mathilda in a house on the outskirts of plantation away from the town. Belfeels objectifies her and treats her ruthlessly on various occasions. On their first encounter, while she was quite young, he undresses her using the riding crop while her mother turns a blind eye. Due to this she develops a nausea of leather's smell. She also discovers a dark secret kept by her mother that she herself is Belfeels' daughter which shatters her and provokes her eventually to murder Belfeels.  Publishing and development  The book is Clarke's tenth novel. He had also published five short story collections before this book. Clarke mentioned in an interview that he listened \\"very attentively\\" to American jazz trumpeter, bandleader, and composer Miles Davis while writing some of the sections of the novel. Clarke structured the novel in the form of short stories. The novel was published by Thomas Allen Publishers in November 2002. Clarke mentioned that he got inspired by British poet and writer Geoffrey Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales, a collection of twenty-four stories that runs to over 17,000 lines written in Middle English and its \\"non-traditional\\" usage. He also noted that \\"[his] main concern was to find a language, or to more strictly use the language [he] already knew, in such a way that it become, in [his] manipulation of it, a new language.\\" Clarke said that he intended to \\"creolize Oxford English\\". One of the narratives of the novel is based on a real life incidents of Clarke, which he describes as \\"first confrontations with racism\\". Clarke experienced racism while travelling from Barbados to Little England, Canada with the Trans-Canada Air Lines in September 1955. He narrated the incident as the journey told by Mary-Mathilda, the leading character of the novel, who is travelling from Miami to Buffalo. The novel was later translated into Dutch by publishing house, De Geus. In 2005, when Clarke read De Inventione, an Italian handbook by Marcus Tullius Cicero, he mentioned that if he had known about it while writing the novel, \\"[he] might very well have drawn the characters of Mary- Mathilda; her son, Wilberforce; Sergeant; and the Constable; to say nothing of Mr. Bellfeels; in sharper poignancy and focus\\". In the handbook, Cicero mentions that \\"We hold the following to be the attributes of persons: name, nature, manner of life, fortune, habit, interests, purposes, achievements, accidents, conversation.\\"  Reception and awards  The novel won the 2002 Scotiabank Giller Prize which was adjudged by Barbara Gowdy, Thomas King, and W. H. New while being shortlisted along with Mount Appetite (by Bill Gaston), The Navigator of New York (by Wayne Johnston), Open (by Lisa Moore), and Unless (by Carol Shields). It also won 2003 Commonwealth Writers' Prize for Canada and the Caribbean region and 2003 Trillium Book Award. Upon publication, the novel received mostly favourable reviews with some criticism. Kirkus Reviews appreciated the novel as \\"a memorable landscape of oppression but a problematic central figure\\". While Ihsan Taylor of The New York Times noted that \\"There's a mesmerizing stillness to Austin Clarke's latest novel\\", British writer Maya Jaggi mentions in her The Guardian review that the \\"[novel]'s meandering orality, its slow-burning power, succeed movingly in asserting memory over the silent gaps in recorded history.\\" Another British novelist Naeem Murr criticised Clarke for losing confidence in his characters and for forcing them deliver sociological truths but appreciates the \\"brilliantly written dialogue\\". Craig Taylor in his Quill & Quire review called the novel as \\"a wonderful book to meander\\" and mentioned that \\"it adheres to the slow pace of the life it describes and allows characters room to become memorable.\\" Jeffrey Brown of PBS noted in an interview with Clarke: \\"There is a mix in your book of a kind of... I would call it almost a high poetic language, a very formal language, and then a dialect, the way they would talk to each other.\\"  References  Category:2002 Canadian novels Category:Novels by Austin Clarke Category:Books about Barbados Category:Scotiabank Giller Prize-winning works Category:Barbados in World War II ","title":"The Polished Hoe"},{"id":"21685059","text":"Daruni Maira is a village in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan.

Amitabh Bachchan One of the first celebrities to discuss the film was Bollywood superstar Amitabh Bachchan,What do real slumdogs think of Slumdog Millionaire?. The Times. 9 February 2009. from whom young Jamal eagerly seeks an autograph shortly after the beginning of the film and who was the original presenter for Kaun Banega Crorepati, the Indian version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? On 13 January 2009 Bachchan wrote that in another part of his blog there were \\"comments for the film SlumDog Millionaire\\" which, as he noted, indicated \\"anger by some on its contents.\\" Bachchan also wrote: \\"It's just that the SM idea authored by an Indian and conceived and cinematically put together by a Westerner, gets creative Globe recognition. The other would perhaps not.\\" These remarks were widely reported on by the press in India and abroad as a criticism of the film. In a later blog entry, Bachchan stated that his remarks had been misconstrued. He wrote: \\"Fact is ‚Äì some one mentioned the film on my blog...I merely put both of them up and invited debate [...] Media, in India has taken the pros and cons of OTHERS, as MINE, built their headlines and put it safely out, thereby, causing the consternation.\\" In another entry, Bachchan also wrote that Anil Kapoor invited him by phone to the premiere of the film. During the same phone call, Bachchan spoke with Danny Boyle, whom he described as \\"gracious and complimentary to me and my work.\\" Bachchan stated that he offered his \\"apologies\\" to Boyle for the critical comments \\"created by media\\" but attributed to him, and he noted that Boyle \\"understands and acknowledges my calling him.\\" Following the film's release in India on 23 January 2009, Bachchan called the movie \\"wonderful\\" and praised the fact that A.R. Rahman had received three Oscar nominations. Bachchan wrote: \\"I feel this win by Rahman and Rasool is most deserving and feel extremely proud to be an Indian.\\"Slumdog makes India proud with 8 Oscars. The Times of India. 24 February 2009. Gopal Singh Nepali The author of the song \\"Darshan Do Ghanshyam\\" () is said in the film to be the blind poet Surdas. However, the song is originally from the movie Narsi Bhagat (1957) written by Gopal Singh Nepali. His children have filed a complaint about the incorrect portrayal. Loveleen Tandan On 11 December 2008, the day Golden Globe nominations were announced, Chicago film critic Jan Lisa Huttner launched an online campaign questioning why Loveleen Tandan, the film's credited co-director, was not nominated along with Danny Boyle for Best Director. \\"Knowing that Loveleen Tandan was a critical part of Slumdog's filmmaking and marketing phases,\\" she wrote, \\"how can we all sit by and watch while she's totally ignored in the awards phase?\\" Huttner also provided statistics showing \\"how rare it is for female directors to be in the awards race.\\" After learning of this campaign, Tandan sought to end it, stating, \\"I can't tell you how embarrassed I am by this [...] The suggestion is highly inappropriate, and I am writing to you to stress that I would not wish it to be considered.\\" Slumdog Millionaire's producer Christian Colson stated that Tandan's role as co-director was being misconstrued to place her on an equal creative footing with Boyle. Colson noted that the title of \\"co-director (India)\\" given to Tandan was \\"strange but deserved\\" and was developed over \\"a Coca Cola and a cup of tea\\" in order to identify her as \\"one of our key cultural bridges.\\" Colson's remarks triggered negative feedback from multiple organisations including WomenArts, the Women Film Critics Circle, and the Women's Media Center. Eventually, even though she was not present at any prior ceremonies (including Golden Globes, BAFTA, or DGA), Tandan was a member of the team which went up on stage to accept the Oscar for Best Picture of 2009. On 15 May 2010, Jan Lisa Huttner received a \\"Silver Feather\\" award from the Illinois Woman's Press Association commending her for her work on the 2009 Oscar controversy. Protests and lawsuits Following its release in India, the film faced criticism from various members of the public alleging that the film fuels Western stereotypes about poverty in India and that it peddles \\"poverty porn\\". Tapeshwar Vishwakarma, a representative of a slum-dwellers' welfare group, filed a defamation lawsuit against the film's music composer A.R. Rahman and actor Anil Kapoor, alleging that grim depiction of slum dwellers violated their human rights. Vishwakarma's filing argued that the very title of the movie is derogatory, and he was particularly displeased that Indians associated with the film did not object to the use of word \\"slumdog.\\" Nicholas Almeida, a social activist working in Mumbai, organized a protest against the film on the grounds that it intentionally exploited the poor for the purposes of profit, also arguing that the title Slumdog Millionaire is offensive, demeaning, and insulting to their dignity. The protesters were Mumbai slum dwellers who objected to the film's title and held up signs reading: \\"I am not a dog.\\" Slum dwellers in Patna, the capital of the Indian state of Bihar, also protested against the movie, with the campaign reaching a climax on 26 January 2009, when \\"protesters tore down posters and ransacked a movie theatre\\" screening the film. The following day, the police in Bihar tightened security \\"outside theatres in the state to thwart any further attacks.\\" Activists stated that slum dwellers would continue to protest until the film's director deleted the word \\"dog\\" from the title. Newsweek magazine asked the film's director, Danny Boyle: \\"Some activists have claimed that the title is demeaning. What did you mean by 'slumdog'?\\" Boyle answered: \\"This is one of the saddest things for me.... Basically [the title] is a hybrid of the word \\"underdog\\"‚Äîand everything that means in terms of rooting for the underdog and validating his triumph‚Äîand the fact that he obviously comes from the slums. That's what we intended.\\"Zakaria, Fareed. \\"Slum Voyeurism?\\", 30 January 2009 The Hindu organisations Hindu Janjagruti Samiti (HJS) and Shiv Sena protested against the film for its portrayal of the Hindu God Rama. An HJS spokesman stated that the film's portrayal of Rama is derogatory and \\"hurts the sentiments of Hindus.\\" Writing for the conservative Daily Pioneer, Kanchan Gupta reiterated the objections of the activist groups that the film provides a one-sided portrayal of the complexities of religious conflict in India, and that the film depicts Hindus as \\"rapacious monsters\\".  Child actors still living in slums  For their work on the movie, according to London's Daily Telegraph, Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail (youngest Salim) was paid ¬£1,700 and Rubina Ali (youngest Latika) ¬£500. The children received considerably less than the Afghan child stars of The Kite Runner, who had been paid ¬£9,000, even though The Kite Runner was far less of a box office hit. At the end of filming for the movie, both of the child actors continued to live in makeshift shacks in the illegal slums of Bandra, a suburb of Mumbai, according to The Daily Telegraph and ABC News. On 26 January 2009, Danny Boyle (director) and Christian Colson (producer) released a written statement saying that they had \\"paid painstaking and considered attention to how Azhar and Rubina's involvement in the film could be of lasting benefit to them over and above the payment they received for their work.\\" Boyle and Colson stated that they had \\"set up trust funds for Rubina and Azharuddin and paid for their education.\\" The filmmakers noted that they had also hired transportation to get the children to a nonprofit English- language school for the next eight years,\\"What Will Happen to Slumdog's Child Stars?\\", Time, 10 March 2009. and that both children would receive ¬£20 a month for books and food. The exact amount of the trust funds was not disclosed by the filmmakers. As Boyle explained, \\"We don't want to reveal exact figures about what's in the trust fund, what's in the bank account for them for when they leave school because it will make them vulnerable and a target really, but it is substantial, and they will hopefully gain benefit from the film long after the film has disappeared and long after the media who are chasing them at the moment sadly have lost interest in the film, and that's been our approach throughout and I think it's the right approach.\\" According to The Economic Times, ¬£17,500 had been placed into a trust fund for Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail which he will receive, plus interest, when he turns 18. Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail's father, Mohammed Ismail, demanded more money for his son in light of the film's success. He stated, \\"My son has taken on the world and won. I am so proud of him but I want more money. They promised me a new house but it hasn't happened. I'm still in the slum. I want the money now, it is of no use later. Mr. Boyle should take care of my son.\\" He also claimed, \\"There is none of the money left. It was all spent on medicines to help me fight TB.\\" Defenders of the filmmakers noted that there was no assurance that any money given directly to Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail would not be used by his father for his own purposes, as had happened with previous Indian child actors from slums. Both Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail and Rubina Ali attended the 81st Academy Awards on 22 February 2009, along with all the other actors who had played Salim, Jamal, and Latika. Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail was accompanied by his mother, Shameem Ismail, while Rubina Ali was accompanied by her uncle. On 25 February 2009, the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority announced that both Azharuddin and Rubina would be given \\"free houses\\" so that they would no longer have to live in the Mumbai slum of Garib Nagar.Gina Serpe, \\"Slumdog Kids No Longer Slumming It\\", E!, 25 February 2009. The filmmakers stated that they had hired local social workers to facilitate this move for the children's families. In the wake of Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail and Rubina Ali's newfound relative affluence, the pressures upon them from the adults in their lives increased. Rubina Ali's custody became an issue, as her biological mother tried to gain custody from the stepmother who had raised her, apparently to get access to Rubina Ali's funds and improved lifestyle. The British tabloids reported that Rubina was also recently \\"offered up for sale by her father, demanding ¬£200,000 (US$295k) for the 'Oscar child'\\".Mazher Mahmood, \\"Slumdog Millionaire star Rubina Ali who played Latika is offered for sale by dad Rafiq Qureshi to the News of the World's Fake Sheikh\\", News of the World, 19 April 2009.

More than two years after the movie's release in London, Rubina Ali continued to live in an illegal slum in Gharib Nagar.

The station is located in the city of Afragola, in the Naples metropolitan area, and was developed to serve all high-speed trains on the Rome‚ÄìNaples high-speed line, aside from those that do not start or finish at Napoli Centrale station, but instead operate over the Naples‚ÄìSalerno high-speed line. Napoli Afragola station was conceived of under a wider plan calling for 13 new stations at various sections along Italy's existing high-speed rail network. It operates as a major rail interchange for Italy's southern region, serving four individual high-speed lines, three inter-regional lines, and a single local commuter route. The station has been called the ‚ÄòGateway to the South‚Äô and is considered a major transport hub and regional gateway for Naples. Construction Italian state railway operator Rete Ferroviaria Italiana (RFI) developed the station. In 2003, a contract was awarded to architect Zaha Hadid Architects for the station design. On 4 November 2003, Zaha Hadid formally presented the design, then projected to open in 2009. The project was delayed in part due to budgetary shortfalls. At one stage, RFI had awarded the ‚Ç¨59.5 million contract for the station's construction to a consortium, but subsequent disputes over the price caused RFI to reissue its call for offers. Construction activity was stop-and-go through early 2015. In February 2015, a new construction contract was awarded to the multinational construction firm Astaldi. From its inception the building was envisioned as a bridge over its eight tracks, with four levels and a maximum height of . Accommodating the station's concourse, the bridge has an area of , as well as provision for an additional . Placing the concourse directly above each platform minimizes passenger walking, without prioritizing the communities at one end of the station over the other. The station design responds to its adjacent business park and landscape, to encourage further nearby development. The four-level station incorporates public amenities, retail outlets, and waiting areas while remaining spacious and open; the space above the main waiting area accommodates restaurants, bars and stores, as well as a bus station and 1,400 parking spaces. The exterior features large glass panels forming winding shapes, described as evoking a moving train. To adapt the station to its context, it includes views of the nearby Mount Vesuvius. The design addressed seismic requirements by dividing the building into zones no greater in length than 50 metres; enabling the sections to move individually in a seismic event. Considerable attention was paid to the station's overall environmental design, which was developed by engineering practice Max Fordham. Reportedly, a key objective of the structure was to have minimised energy consumption, favour passive operations over active interventions, and as little environmental impact as possible, in both the construction and operational phases. One major example of this design attention is the glazed roof, which features internal shading and acoustic baffles, limiting the amount of direct sunlight and glare on the concourse as well directing excess heat away via purpose-built roof vents; this enabled natural ventilation practices to be used under normal conditions. While mechanical ventilation systems are also present in the building, such as the roof-level extractor fans, these are intended to be used only during the extremes of summer and winter. Wherever realistically possible, passive means of environmental regulation were used. This includes cooling with ground water. Benches are actively cooled for comfort. The active tracks, especially those of the Rome-Naples high-speed line, also presented challenges in both the planning and construction processes, although the speeds on these lines were limited to 160 km/h (100 mph) while traversing the construction area. During the construction phase, the presence of the operating high-speed lines split the site into two separate and somewhat disconnected zones; materials and equipment had to be transported between either side via an existing ring road, while an existing underpass served as a pedestrian crossing for workers. In order to protect the high speed line from potential disruption during the work, a temporary roof structure composed of steel elements and a metal sheet topping, was set up around it. The building of scaffolding decks, overpass beams and other elements of the upper levels of the station, had to be built with consideration for the operational electrification system of the running lines, somewhat complicating the work. The curved structural elements of the station building were constructed using technologies developed and previously deployed by the architecture firm. These were formed primarily of concrete, which had been supported and shaped by prefabricated steel units combined with temporary moulds created by CNC- milling, allowing for complex shapes, durability and strength. Building Information Modelling (BIM) was adopted as a support tool, while 3D modeling proved useful for communicating process information within the technical office and with third parties. 20,000 square metres of matte cladding was installed. A total of 5,000 tonnes of steel were required for the scaffolding decks and curved roofs, while 200 km (125 miles) of cabling and in excess of 2,000 LED lights were installed across 4,000 metres of lighting tubes, which were integrated into the steel roof beams. On a stage, there were 330 workers on site daily, peaking at 700. Opening On 6 June 2017, five days ahead of its official opening, the first stage of Napoli Afragola was inaugurated in a ceremony attended by the Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni, who commented on its purpose: ‚ÄúAny great country needs great projects that are a leap forward...The new station at Afragola is the foundation of the infrastructure programme to promote economic development in the south.‚Äù\\"Napoli Afragola - Italy‚Äôs remarkable new station.\\" Rail Engineer, 28 June 2017. Since 11 June, the station has been served by 36 high-speed trains each day; of these, 18 are Frecciarossas operated by the state rail company Trenitalia and 18 are Italos by the privately-owned open access company NTV. These have been projected to carry a combined 10,000 passengers daily. Further services are to be added to the station, such as a planned increase to 28 trains in either direction, once additional infrastructure work in the region has been completed; phase two of the station is scheduled to be completed during 2022, to coincide with the opening of the Naples-Bari high speed line.

The legal entity managing the Rovinari mine is the National Company of Lignite Oltenia which was set up in 1997.  Description  The exploitation has four open pits Tismana I, Tismana II, G√¢rla - Rovinari Est and Pinoasa that produced 8 million tonnes of lignite in 2008. The mine has around 3,000 workers and is endowed with 23 bucket-wheel excavators, 14 spreaders, three mixed machines and one deposits spreader. The total proven recoverable reserves of the mine amount to 610 million tonnes of lignite. Oltenia Energy Complex was established on May 31, 2012 following the decision of the Romanian Government to reorganize the power sector, by the merger of Societatea Nationala a Lignitului Oltenia and the three power generation companies (Complexul Energetic Rovinari, Complexul Energetic Turceni and Complexul Energetic Craiova). 11 power units with an installed capacity of 3,240 MW one of which: Rovinari Power Plant has four 330 MW lignite-fired condensation power units. It has three functional units: 3, 4 and 6; unit 5 undergoing modernisation. = 2014 to Present = In 2014, Oltenia Energy Complex (OEC), revealed that plans had been put on hold, just days after an agreement for the joint venture to implement the project had been concluded. Reports cited questions over the profitability of the proposed venture, and whether it would even be possible to recover the one billion Euro investment and production costs. The OEC responded that it would conduct a feasibility study. In April 2017, in a sign that the project was again moving forward, the CHEC and OEC announced the establishment of a joint venture company, Huadian Oltenia Energy SA, in which Huadian is the majority shareholder with 91.06 percent. In August that year, the Romanian Ministry of Energy announced that it had officially resumed talks with CHEC for construction of the new power plant. Analysts say that given current plans it is conceivable that up to 3.5 GW of coal plant capacity could go online in southeast Europe with Chinese financial support in the coming years. Consider that the massive Rovinari project, which could supply up to five percent of Romania‚Äôs energy needs, will have a lifespan of up to 40 years, and will not begin sending electricity to the grid until at the earliest 2023. That commits Romania to the operation of the plant up to 2063. According to the Energy Strategy of Romania for the period 2019 ‚Äì 2030, realization of the 600 MW energy group at the Rovinari Power Plant is considered a strategic investment of national interest, in order to consolidate the national energy market and the diversified energy mix, by capitalizing on the primary energy resources and stimulating domestic investment to provide equipment and materials. The new group will be a high-performance generation unit, the facility being provided with the best available techniques for reducing particulate matter, NOx and SO2 emissions, with the possibility of adding CO2 capture, transport and geological storage technology, to comply with the regulations in force and to meet the requirements for limiting the emissions of pollutants. The energy group will use about 5 million tons of lignite annually and will generate about 4,000 jobs during the implementation of the project. The investment was estimated at approximately EUR 1 billion. Negotiations are currently under way to conclude the superficies and coal supply agreements, which are priorities for this year.  Concerns  If the project went ahead, the new unit would be located next to the town of Rovinari, increasing existing air pollution levels from the other 4 units. The lignite would be supplied from the nearby open-pit mines ‚Äì Tismana I and II, Rosia, Pinoasa, all owned by the same Oltenia Energy Complex ‚Äì which would require expansion of production capacity. Extending these mines would mean clearing huge land areas, in most cases accompanied by massive deforestation. Environmental concerns are related to EU Directive 2011/92/EU on environmental impact assessment makes licensing coal plants more complicated than before, as the project‚Äôs impact on climate and the vulnerability of the project to climate change must be explicitly considered in the environmental impact assessment. Economical concerns are that the project would likely have difficulties in meeting the project‚Äôs debt service requirements as the organic cash flow generation would be limited and not sufficient under current energy market prices.  Health Issues  According to the Europe Beyond Coal NGO, Rovinari ranks 33 among the deadliest coal power plants in the European Union. The NGO attributed 142 premature deaths in the region in 2015 to the pollution emitted by the power plant. In 2016 there were 326 cases of bronchitis,14.989 asthma attacks in children, 504 hospital admissions, 170793 lost working days, 1.9 millions EUR health costs.  Legal Charges  Two environmental advocacy groups, Greenpeace Romania and ClientEarth submitted a legal challenge in May 2019 against the permit for Rovinari. The permit was granted in September 2018, nearly a year after its previous permit expired.

The Signal. 3/19/08. History In the Julian calendar, the vernal equinox moved gradually away from 21 March. The Gregorian calendar reform restored the vernal equinox to its original date, but since the festival was by now tied to the date, not the astronomical event, Kha b-Nisan remains fixed at 21 March in the Julian reckoning, corresponding to 1 April in the Gregorian calendar. The Vernal equinox is celebrated throughout Greater Iran as Noruz (meaning \\"New Day\\") on 21 March. However, in the ancient Assyrian, Akkadian and Babylonian traditions, the spring festival was celebrated in the first days of the month known as \\"Nisan\\"E. Elochukwu Uzukwu.

Published by S. Bagster and Sons, 1876. lending to the term \\"Kha b-Nisan\\", or the \\"first of Nisan\\". In the 1950s, a rising upsurge in Assyrian nationalism resulted in the creation of an official \\"Assyrian calendar\\" with its era fixed at 4750 BC, inspired by an estimate of the date of the first temple at Ashur in the Middle Ubaid period. In the same spirit, the Akkadian name of the spring festival, Akitu, was revived. It is essential to consider that the Assyrian people have generally celebrated Akitu on the first day of April since 4750 BC and that a creation of an official calendar would aim to unite the Assyrians in their nationalism. The event is also largely celebrated by Assyrians residing in Syria. Although the Syrian government does not acknowledge the festival, Assyrians still continue with the celebration.http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/topic,463af2212,46ef83f52,4959de172,0.html In 2002, Assyrians in Syria celebrated the event with a mass wedding of 16 couples and over 25,000 attendees.http://www.bethsuryoyo.com/currentevents/6752HomelandCelebration/CelebrationInSyria.html After the formation of Turkey, Kha b-Nisan along with Nowruz were banned from public to celebrate. Assyrians in Turkey were first allowed to publicly celebrate Kha b-Nisan in 2005, after organisers received permission from the government to stage the event, in light of democratic reforms adopted in support of Turkey's EU membership bid.Assyrians Celebrate New Year for First Time in Turkey (SETimes.com)Erkan's field diary: Around 5,000 people \\"including large groups of visiting ethnic Assyrians from Europe, Syria and Iraq\\" took part in the Kha b-Nisan celebrations.NYT (4 April 2005) One of the largest Assyrian New Year celebration took place in Iraq in 2008. Public celebrations were not allowed by Saddam Hussein's regime prior to the start of the Iraq war. The event was organized by the Assyrian Democratic Movement and between 45,000 and 65,000 people took part in the parade.http://www.zindamagazine.com/html/archives/2008/04.14.08/index_mon.php#goodmorningassyria In 2004, Hon.

They also gather in clubs and social institutions and listen to the poets who recite the story of creation. The men and women wear traditional clothes and dance in parks for hours. It has also become tradition to hold a parade down King Sargon Blvd in Chicago, Illinois, with the Assyrian organizations, churches, and sometimes businesses, each creating a float and participating in the parade. It is a tradition in Assyrian villages for girls to gather flowers and herbs which are then suspended under the house's roof. The bunches are referred to as \\"Deqna d-Nisan\\"Ashor Giwargis.

LifeYouth and military career= Mukhanov family in 1847 Sergei S. Mukhanov (or Muchanow by Polish orthography) was born in northern Russian town Vologda, as a third child to the family of major general Sergei Nikolaievich Mukhanov, governor of Kharkov Governorate (now Ukraine), and Minadora, Countess von Sievers. Serving in the military from his youth, he found himself in Warsaw in 1861, being appointed adjutant general to Alexander von L√ºders and becoming a gendarme lieutenant in July 1862 ‚Äì in the latter of which roles he served as chief of police in Warsaw and, among other things, was responsible for compiling the nominal lists according to them enforced conscription of 12,000 Polish men to the Russian Imperial Army were carried out. (This measure was intended to prevent the explosion of the rebellion, but it proved unsuccessful and, on the contrary, hastened it.) When the January Uprising began he fought as adjutant alongside the next governor, Grand Duke Constantine Nikolaevich of Russia. Yet, two months later (March 1863), while the Uprising gradually gained its momentum, he resigned as police chief. =Organizer of Polish cultural life= Almost from the very beginning of his stay in Warsaw Muchanow had belonged to the aristocratic artistic salons, particularly that of the pianist Maria Kalergis (n√©e Nesselrode). Maria's estranged first husband died in 1863‚Äì10 years younger than her, and hoping to raise his social position by marrying her, Muchanow proposed and was accepted. The wedding took place in Baden-Baden on 30 September 1863. Muchanow's resignation of his career to marry her and the resulting financial strains, however, caused Maria to have a nervous breakdown and it was only some time later that she was able to go to Saint Petersburg to obtain his appointment as administrator of imperial palaces in the Kingdom of Poland and President of the Warsaw Theatre Directorate. Also supported by governor Fiodor Berg in this request, Muchanow received these posts on 27 April 1868. He and his wife then brought about a rise in theatrical life in Warsaw ‚Äì with the aid of the Directorate's administrative directors Miko≈Çaj Bojanowski and Bogumi≈Ç Foland, Muchanow was able to give the city's theatres settled financing systems and find an additional income source in the form of tax concessions in the gardens around the theatres. He also managed to overhaul the city's theatre buildings and oversee the opening of the Summer Theatre (Teatr Letni). In these efforts, Muchanow was able to count on the support of governor Berg (convinced to support the theatres by Maria) as well as major Polish cultural figures such as Stanis≈Çaw Moniuszko, Jan Chƒôci≈Ñski, Aleksander Narcyz Przezdziecki, J√≥zef Kenig and W≈Çadys≈Çaw Bogus≈Çawski. He invited Helena Modrzejewska to Warsaw, granting her various privileges, such as selection of the repertoire ‚Äì and she appeared onstage there in plays of Shakespeare, S≈Çowacki, Schiller and Fredro. The operatic repertoire, swelled by songs by Moniuszko, also prospered. Muchanow ensured the creation of a team of actors and Modrzejewska and actors already well known to Warsaw audiences such as Alojzy ≈ª√≥≈Çkowski, Jan Kr√≥likowski, Wiktoryna Baka≈Çowiczowa, Salomea Pali≈Ñska and Aleksandra Rakiewiczowa were joined by newcomers such as Romana Popiel, Wincenty Rapacki, Boles≈Çaw Leszczy≈Ñski, Marian Pra≈ºmowski and Edward Wolski. This period became known as \\"the age of stars\\" (epoka gwiazd). Muchanow's success declined from 1874 with the death of Maria on 22 June and of Jan Chƒôci≈Ñski on 30 December. Modrzejewska thus lost her protectoress and, getting entangled in problems with the censors and other company members, she soon left for the United States. Rapacki, Bogus≈Çawski and Emil Deryng could not fill Modrzejewska's role as head of the company, nor could Deryng's daughter Maria. Muchanow made a last attempt at glory by making Jan Tatarkiewicz director in 1878 and taking on actors such as Jadwiga Czaki, Adolfina Zimajer, J√≥zef Kotarbi≈Ñski and Honorata Leszczy≈Ñska (daughter of Wincenty Rapacki), but neither measure had success and Muchanow began putting on little theater and opera, focusing instead on the ballet company. =Retirement and death= He retired from his post as head of the directorate on 12 June 1880 and soon moved to countryside; in 1882 marrying Waleria Pignan. (Pignan had made her debut in September 1869 as a student of the Warsaw ballet school, had performed in several well-known productions of the 1870s, and had become known as one of the Directorate's most talented dancers before leaving the stage to marry Muchanow.) Died on May 29, 1897 in Przemƒôczany village near town Miech√≥w.

Located on the corner of Fifth and Main Streets, it is noted for its Art Deco design with terracotta ornamentation and setbacks on the top floors. The hotel was constructed in 1929 and operated for over 50 years before it sat vacant for nearly 20 years. The Blackstone Hotel guest list is full of notable people including Presidents of the United States: Harry S. Truman, Dwight D. Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, and Richard M. Nixon. The hotel was also host for a few movie stars such as Bob Hope, Clark Gable, and Elvis Presley. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places (Building #84001961) on February 2, 1984. The building was restored in the late 1990s and is still in use today as the Courtyard Fort Worth Downtown/Blackstone, although it is still known as the \\"Blackstone Hotel\\" to those who live in or have ties to Fort Worth. HistoryBlackstone Hotel (1929-1952)= The 23-story, 284-room Blackstone Hotel had its official grand opening on October 10, 1929. The hotel was built by cattleman C.A. \\"Gus\\" O'Keefe and designed by architects Mauran, Russell & Crowell from St. Louis; the contractors were Bellows and Marclay. Famed Fort Worth resident Amon G. Carter was the first guest of the new Blackstone Hotel. Sid Richardson had a penthouse in the Blackstone for $750 a month from 1929‚Äì1932. The Blackstone was the first skyscraper in Fort Worth to embrace Art Deco architectural elements. The structure was built with reinforced concrete, and the exterior boasted buff color brick with terracotta ornament throughout. The ground floor facade is faced with Minnesota granite. The setbacks on the top floors allowed private outdoor terraces for guests. The interior showcased a two-story lobby with a mezzanine, wide stairwells, a Venetian ballroom, and Italian marble placed on pillars and floors throughout. Fort Worth's first radio station, WBAP, was based out of the Blackstone Hotel in the mid-1930s. Although initially leased to the Blue Bonnet Hotel Company, the building was initially managed by Wallace N. Robinson Hotels Company and taken over by H. Fuller Stevens, of Dallas, in 1946. It was in the Blackstone's Venetian Ballroom that the Texas Democratic Executive Committee met in September of 1948 to determine if Lyndon B. Johnson's narrow victory over Coke Stevenson was valid. =Hilton Hotel (1952‚Äì1962)= In 1952, the Blackstone came under the ownership of Conrad Hilton. For the next 10 years, the building would be known as the Hilton Hotel. During that time, an addition was constructed to the south, adding additional ground level retail, a new ballroom, meeting rooms, and a rooftop swimming pool. Interior renovations were undertaken, including closing in the two-story lobby and converting the mezzanine into a second floor. Abandoned Blackstone Hotel in 1990 =Blackstone Hotel (1962‚Äì1982)= The Hilton Hotel was again sold, and the name reverted to the Blackstone Hotel. During the next twenty years, the building would fall into a dilapidated state. In the 1970s, the Venetian Ballroom served as a temporary pornographic cinema and Fort Worth police's vice squad made frequent arrests. In 1979 Olympic gymnast Nadia Comaneci described her team's stay at the Blackstone as \\"awful, terrible, mediocre, but what the hell.\\" The steady decline in business finally forced the closing of the hotel due to bankruptcy of the owners, seeing its last guest at that time in 1982. =Vacant (1982‚Äì1997)= The hotel closed down in 1982, mothballed for almost twenty years. Ground level windows and doors were boarded up, covered by murals painted by local citizens. Many windows in upper floors were broken or opened, allowing rain and birds to enter the structure, causing further deterioration. Windows on the top floor were removed for unknown reasons, and the basement was flooded for many years. Restoration of the former Blackstone Hotel in 1998 =Restoration (1997‚Äì1999)= The Blackstone Hotel building was purchased by Louisiana-based Historic Restoration, Inc. (HRI) for an estimated $2.2 million in 1997, and restoration commenced in 1998. An exterior elevator was installed, and workers converged on the building. The City of Fort Worth contributed 10 years of bed tax to Marriott Corp. in pursuit of restoration. There are no known original drawings of the interior, so HRI documented every aspect of the building, including measurements of floor-to-ceiling heights and mechanical equipment. Original plaster ceilings found hidden behind suspended ceilings were discovered. The interior was gutted down to the floor plates, stairwells, and elevator shafts. This work included removal of escalators in the lobby and tearing out and replacing all electrical and plumbing. The guest room window frames, made of cypress wood, were restored, and broken glass replaced. The annex, originally constructed when the hotel was part of the Hilton chain in the 1950s, was converted to an indoor valet parking garage while the top floor hosted additional guestrooms, a swimming pool, hot tub, and a workout room. The original Italian marble in the lobby was removed during prior renovations, but marble from the vestibule of the Venetian Ballroom was used on the pillars and around the elevators. Moldings were cast of the terracotta above the first floor on the exterior and placed on the top of the columns in the lobby. The exterior was washed and restored to its original appearance. Very little was touched on the exterior due to the building's historical significance. A small set of original terrazzo steps that lead to nowhere remain in the lobby due to their historical significance. The estimated cost of the restoration was $26 million. Ruth Carter Stevenson, daughter of famed Fort Worth resident Amon G.

Courtyard by Marriott 2000/2001 =Courtyard by Marriott Fort Worth/Blackstone (1999‚Äìpresent)= The Blackstone was officially branded the Courtyard by Marriott Fort Worth Downtown-Blackstone and reopened to the public on April 7, 1999, offering 203 guestrooms on 20 floors with a Corner Bakery Cafe on the ground floor.

FLAC has been involved in a number of notable cases including Airey v. Ireland.  History  FLAC was created in April 1969, a group of law students who used their legal knowledge to provide advice and information to those who could not afford the fees involved. They promoted access to legal redress for all, regardless of economic status. It was through this work that they hoped to advance their ultimate objective: influence the government into instituting a comprehensive plan providing civil legal aid to those in need. FLAC's operations expanded rapidly. By 1972, 2,437 cases had been handled. By 1974, this had risen to over 8,000. In some ways, these efforts distracted from the greater campaign for state-funded civil legal aid. Yet, ultimately it was a threat by FLAC to withdraw these services which forced the government to take action on civil legal aid.\\"Too Little Too Late\\" by Don Buckley - Newspaper account of FLAC's threatened strike action leading to the formation of the Pringle Committee Publisher: The Irish Times 12 December 1974 Responding to FLAC's campaign, the government formed the Pringle Committee in 1974 to address the issue of civil legal aid in Ireland. Meanwhile, FLAC continued its own efforts, achieving one of its early ambitions in 1975 by opening the first community law centre in Ireland. In 1977, the Pringle Committee published its Report calling for the provision of state-funded legal aid centres and for individuals to be educated about their rights, echoing the demands made by FLAC. However, the government remained slow to implement the Pringle Report. FLAC would emerge as a central player in a case which finally induced the government to take action: the landmark ECHR case, Airey v. Ireland}, which challenged the prohibitive costs of a legal separation as breaching an individual's access to justice. Supported by FLAC and represented by Mary Robinson, Josie Airey won her case against the state and assurances of an adequate scheme of legal aid were secured from the government. \\"I broke through all the red tape didn't I\\" by Mary Ireland- Newspaper account of the Airey ruling Publisher: The Irish Times 23 March 1979 Since the 'Airey' case, FLAC has been involved in some of the most significant legal developments in Ireland's recent history. Among them was FLAC's representation of 1800 married women seeking arrears of social welfare which eventually (after further litigation) resulted in the Irish government paying ¬£265 million in compensation to 70,000 women. In 2009 FLAC established the Public Interest Law Alliance (PILA), in order to develop public interest law in Ireland - and PILA continues to effectively engage civil society and the legal community in advancing social change. 2015 saw the introduction of the Gender Recognition Act in Ireland following twenty years of campaigning and litigation by transgender woman Lydia Foy, supported by FLAC. In 2019, the fiftieth year of FLAC, Irish President Michael D. Higgins opened FLAC's new headquarters at 85/86 Upper Dorset Street.

It has two shafts: Konrad I and Konrad II. History The iron ore deposits have been mined since the start of the industrialization in the Salzgitter area. The first activities began in 1867. The shaft Konrad is the youngest of the former iron ore mines in this region. It has two shafts, of which Schacht Konrad I, is approximately 1232 meters and Schacht Konrad II is around 999 meters deep. The mining operation on Konrad lasted from 1961 to 1976. During this period, a total of 6.7 million tonnes of iron ore were retrieved. Authorization for radioactive waste disposal The shaft Konrad is an unusually dry iron ore mine. Since this is one of the criteria for a deep final repository for radioactive waste, the studies on the possibility of a disposal site were started in 1975. The Physikalisch- Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) started the plannings procedure on 31 August 1982. The Bundesamt f√ºr Strahlenschutz, the Ministry of Environment of Lower Saxony and the Deutsche Gesellschaft zum Bau und Betrieb von Endlagern f√ºr Abfallstoffe discussed the issue between September 1992 and March 1993. On 22 May 2002 the license for the final deep geological storage of medium- and low level radioactive waste was approved. Several complaints against the license were filled at the Oberverwaltungsgericht L√ºneburg. Key action points were the long-term safety, the safety studies were 25 years old and little based on facts, accidents, transport of radioactive waste, radioactive exposure to the population in the area, possible terrorist attacks, the lack of a comparative assessment with other locations and the planning jurisdiction of municipalities. The hearing was on February 28 - March 2, 2006. The Oberverwaltungsgericht L√ºneburg dismissed the cases as ungrounded in March 2006. Given the fundamental importance of the ruling individual plaintiffs still sought a revision to the Federal Administrative Court of Germany (by non-admission complaint), which however was not accepted in 2007. The license approves the storage of up to 0.000303 km¬≥ (or 303,000 m¬≥) of low- and medium level radioactive waste. After the initial phase of final storage to clear the backlog of 88,000 m¬≥ waste in other locations the expected traffic is 10 road freight vehicles and one train of 20 freight wagons per week. By the end of 2007 around 945 million euros has been spent on reconnaissance and planning, for the remaining necessary measures such as the upgrading of the mine and completion of the disposal site the costs are estimated at another 900 million euros. Foundation GmbH Schacht Konrad I For the takeover of state-specific responsibilities, which the city and the region Salzgitter bear, a foundation GmbH is proposed by the Federal Ministry for Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety. The energy companies initially bring in 30 million euros with further payments over an initial period of 30 years of service. The federal government will contribute from 2009 to 2043 700,000 euros per year.Umweltminister Gabriel beschenkt die Region um das Endlager \\"Konrad\\" mit millionenschwerer Bundesstiftung The fund will compensate for the lack of tax revenues since the operation of the shaft Konrad like any other business uses the infrastructure in the area of Salzgitter but is relieved from VAT and local tax measures. Conversion The establishment of the technical installations for the disposal and storage chambers started. The conversion will take several years, storage is scheduled to start in 2013. Clustered storage chambers form a storage depot. In total, up to nine storage depots are projected on the existing main soles on 800, 850, 1000, 1100, 1200 and 1300 m depth. The storage chambers are created with a diameter of about 40 m¬≤ with a bottom width of about 7 meters and a height of about 6 meters. Its length should be - depending on the geological and mining technical conditions - 100 to 1000 meters. After the storage of the radioactive containers, the sectional shafts will be closed with concrete for the permanent storage of the nuclear waste.

It is a Linux distribution based on Ubuntu (operating system). The project maintains two custom distributions, with one designed for use on servers and the other for use with the server version on client machines. The server distribution is the official Karoshi, while the client is known as Karoshi Client. TLSP uses prepackaged GUI scripts in order to simplify the install and configuration process for inexperienced users.  History  TLSP was originally developed using Red Hat, early in the 2000s with the aim of making Linux adoption easier for schools in the UK. Linux, at the time, was considered difficult to use in educational environments where computing expertise mainly came from teachers who were not dedicated IT staff. With version 5.1.x, TLSP moved to the PCLinuxOS platform - but has since adopted Ubuntu in its place. The current production version of TLSP is 12.1.  Features  TLSP is downloadable from their homepage. The installation steps require an initial install of Ubuntu, which the Live CD prompts to initiate. Following the machine reboot after installation of Ubuntu, the install of the TLSP system is initiated automatically. = Educational = TLSP is primarily aimed at educational environments, but is also suitable for use in a Small to Medium Enterprise (SME) business environment. The included systems are suitable for use as file and print, email, web and e-learning servers. By leveraging these technologies, it is possible to administer a complete network using the integrated web tools and by using some form of remote desktop technology. = Server Distribution = Primary Domain Controller Capability  The TLSP system is a scalable single or multi server system, comprising many features. Chief among these are the ability to act as a Primary Domain Controller in a Windows network. TLSP uses built in Samba and LDAP servers to store user, group and computer information, and emulates a Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 server system using these technologies, providing computer and user authentication, along with file and print services on the local network. TLSP creates a standard Windows domain for the local network, and names it linuxgrid.  KiXtart  TLSP uses KiXtart scripts to set up Windows XP clients on the domain, providing mandatory profiles to most users on the system. Roaming profiles can be used, but are not recommended, due to the heavy network overhead involved. Using mandatory profiles and folder redirection to mapped file shares on the server, allows every user to store his own files in his \\"My Documents\\" folder.  Servers  TLSP includes the Moodle e-learning package, and several website content management systems, including Joomla! and Website Baker. eGroupWare and SquirrelMail are built into the system, allowing for full calendar and email facilities. These can be installed on a standalone machine in the DMZ section, thus providing increased security on systems that are directly exposed to the internet.  WPKG  Particularly interesting is the inclusion of WPKG, which enables the remote installation of software on Windows clients. By using a machine profile stored on the server, it is possible to install software packages, hotfixes, and security updates in the background. It is also very helpful in terms of creating machine profiles, allowing a 'blank' Windows XP machine to be updated automatically to a particular WPKG profile, once the machine is added to the domain. This type of technology can be compared to the group policy mechanism in Windows Server 2003, particularly from a machine administration perspective. It is by no means a replacement for group policy, but is a step in the right direction. = Client Distribution = The first version of Karoshi Client was based on PCLinuxOS. Further upgrades to the system as a whole led to the client using a modified version of Ubuntu 10.04 LTS with a GUI similar to the Microsoft Windows interface. The interface was designed to be fast, as to run well on older hardware. In June 2012 work was started on Karoshi Client version 2, which would have an interface closer to Gnome 2 than Windows. Development of the client release was given to Robin McCorkell - a student of Dover Grammar School for Boys. On 21 July 2012 Karoshi Client 2 was uploaded to Sourceforge.net.  Technical  Karoshi Client contains many applications which were deemed necessary for school work. Media production software (including music production, image manipulation, and video editing software) are included, along with programming tools and visualization software. Many IDEs are installed by default, mainly set for use with Java, but also supporting C/C++ programming or other languages. The C++ compiler and standard libraries are installed by default, along with the Boost libraries, ncurses and Mesa libraries for OpenGL programming. The Java Development Kit is installed, and integrated with the installed IDEs. Xfce is used as the desktop manager, with a customized theme and panel layout. The developer ported the Clearlooks GTK2 theme to GTK3 so that Gnome 3 applications like gEdit would display correctly. The panel layout is similar to the Gnome 2 environment. Compositing effects have been enabled by default for the environment. The interface settings are locked down in the Xfce configuration files due to the need for suitability in a school environment, where children may try and play with the settings. The KDE greeter for LightDM is used for the log in screen, due to problems with KDM and Ubiquity. This version of Karoshi Client is more integrated with the server distribution than the previous client releases, with most of the custom configuration files pulled down from a primary domain controller on boot up. A server patch that added in the correct files for the client was released on 23 July 2012.  Limitations  It used to be difficult to integrate TLSP into an existing Windows network, without changing the address space to the standard one that is used by the TLSP system. This was only a limitation in early versions and no longer applies.  Future Plans  Kerberos support is planned for the Karoshi server and client system, providing single sign on to all services provided by the Karoshi distribution. This will be unfeasible until Samba 4 is released due to the complexities surrounding integration of user resolution and file access across multiple operating systems, such as those that do not support the Active Directory protocols. Some integration has occurred already with a working client system that authenticates using Kerberos, then authenticates successfully with Moodle, Samba and Squid using Kerberos credentials.

Madden, who joined Essendon from Heathcote, was a forward and topped their goal-kicking twice. The first instance was in 1903 with 15 goals and the second came the following season after kicking 25 goals. Madden contested finals in three of his four seasons but never made it into the premiership decider. The red haired Madden, nicknamed \\"Mad Mick\\", transferred to Victorian Football Association (VFA) club Essendon Association in 1907.Atkinson, p. 98. During his time at Essendon Association he had to sit out of action for a year after receiving a suspension for abusing an umpire. He contested the ban in court and the judge sided with him but the VFA still refused to lift their suspension. Madden returned in time to help Essendon Association become league premiers in 1912, and retired from playing in 1915. The final chapter of Madden's football career was spent as a boundary and goal umpire. He started in the VFA and umpired the 1921 Grand Final, which was abandoned midway through due to hail, some of which had struck Madden, requiring stitches in his scalp. In 1923 he umpired his first VFL match and before retiring in 1929, he had officiated in 93 matches, including the 1928 Grand Final. References *Holmesby, Russell and Main, Jim (2007).

The wai khru ceremony (, pronounced ) is a Thai ritual in which students pay respects to their teachers in order to express their gratitude and formalize the student‚Äìteacher relationship. It is regularly held near the beginning of the school year in most schools in Thailand. Wai khru has long been an important rite in the traditional martial and performing arts, as well as in astrology , Thai Massage and other traditional arts; students and performers of Muay Thai and Krabi Krabong, as well as Thai dance and classical music, will usually perform a wai khru ritual at their initiation as well as before performances to pay respect and homage to both their teachers and the deities who patronize their arts. History The rituals of wai khru are believed to have derived from ancient animistic beliefs, influenced by the spread of Brahmanism from India. This is evident in the wai khru ceremonies of traditional dance and music, where specific mention is made to Ishvara in Thai Massage, where specific mention is made to Shivaga Komarpaj and Narayana, along with other Vedic deities. Wai khru has for most of history existed as a folk tradition, passed on from generation to generation throughout the years.. The wai khru ceremony in its modern form, which is held in most schools today, originated at Triam Udom Suksa School in 1941. The ' chant was written by Thanpuying Dussadee Malakul Na Ayutthaya (the wife of ML Pin Malakul, director of the school at the time). FormIn educational institutions= The wai khru ceremonies which take place in most educational institutions in Thailand today generally follow the same form. The ceremony usually begins with a Buddhist prayer ritual in institutions where Buddhism is observed as the official religion, followed by the students' recitation of the wai khru chant, which expresses respect for and gratitude to the teachers, and asks for the teachers' blessing of their studies. Following this, a select number of students, usually the representatives of each class, will present the teachers with offerings of flowers, candles and joss sticks arranged on phan (traditional Thai pedestalled trays). This is usually followed by a speech by the headteacher offering the students guidance in their academic career. Many institutions also present student awards and honours during the ceremony.. The traditional offerings for wai khru represent a symbolism of student qualities, namely:. * Ixora (khem, ) flowers, which while closed form pointed buds, symbolizing sharp wit, * Cynodon dactylon (ya phraek, or Bermuda grass), the rapid growth and resilience of which symbolize perseverance and the ability to learn, * Popped rice (khao tok, ), which symbolizes discipline, and * Eggplant flowers, which bow low when nearing fruiting, symbolizing respect and humility. The ceremony is usually held shortly after the beginning of the first term, on a Thursday, as Thursday is traditionally the day of Brihaspati, Vedic god of wisdom and teachers. =Thai classical music= Wai khru ceremonies for Thai classical music may be held by professional pi phat ensembles or amateur ensembles attached to institutions such as schools and universities. These also take place on Thursday, and are usually held annually, as well as on a smaller scale for the initiation of those beginning to learn the arts. These ceremonies usually begin with Buddhist rites on the evening before and/or the morning of the ceremony day. Monks may be invited to perform a merit-making ceremony, and almsgiving made to monks in the morning before the ceremony. The setting of the ceremony is usually arranged with a Buddhist altar on one side and a set of musical instruments on the other, with the taphon, which represents Phra Prakhonthap (Pragondharba), god of the drums and grand-teacher of music, placed in a higher position. Khon masks representing the gods and teachers of music, Bharata Muni, Pragondharba, Vishvakarman, Pancasikha and Biraba are usually displayed. Representations of Shiva, Vishnu, Brahma and Ganesha may also be included. A table of offerings to the gods and spirits to be invited during the ceremony is arranged, and (), a bowl of flowers, joss sticks, candles, white cloth and money amounting to six baht, is prepared for worship of the gods. The ceremony is conducted by a presiding teacher, traditionally dressed in white, who leads the assembly in lighting candles and joss sticks, and saying invocations venerating the Three Jewels and deities, asking for their blessing. The musical ensemble will play the na phat, a formal piece of music symbolizing the summoning of the gods and spirits, and the presiding teacher will perform the offering of the prepared foods. Afterwards, the presiding teacher will sprinkle lustral water (prepared earlier during the ceremony) and perform , application of a white paste, to the musical instruments, teachers and participants in the ceremony, for good fortune. The wai khru ceremony is thus concluded, and is usually followed by the khrop khru ceremony, or rite of initiation. =Muay Thai= Wai khru ram muay is a form of wai khru ritual performed by Muay Thai practitioners before a match. Criticism Some observers, including historians Nidhi Eoseewong and Sujit Wongthes, have noted that the modern annual wai khru ceremonies have drifted far from their spirit-worship origins and been transformed into rituals emphasizing the hierarchical status of teachers over students. Whereas older traditions would have teachers and students paying respects together to spirit teachers, the modern tradition instead prominently features the act of students prostrating before their living, personal teachers, a symbolism Sujit believes was invented to promote the government's ideals of authoritarianism during the mid-twentieth century.

Salud, Don M. Cuaresma, Manny Q. Palo and Darnel Joy R. Villaflor. The series stars Angelica Panganiban on her title role as Rubi Perez-Ferrer and Theresa Rodrigo-dela Fuente, and ABS-CBN's Kapamilya Gold Queen Shaina Magdayao as Maribel dela Fuente-Cardenas, together with leading men Jake Cuenca and Diether Ocampo, with an ensemble cast consisting of Cherry Pie Picache, Cherie Gil, Gardo Versoza, Allan Paule, Kaye Abad, Susan Africa, Wowie de Guzman, Coney Reyes, Juan Rodrigo, Dante Rivero, Bing Loyzaga, Rey \\"PJ\\" Abellana, Megan Young, and Mel Martinez. The series premiered on ABS-CBN's Primetime Bida evening block from February 15 to August 13, 2010. The main difference of this teleserye to others is that the lead character, Rubi, is an anti-hero dubbed as \\"Ang Bidang-Kontrabida\\" (The Villainous Protagonist). She is vain, scheming and manipulative but still has heart, but chose not to listen to her conscience to reach her high ambitions. PlotBeginning= Vivian (Cherry Pie Picache) gives birth to her daughter while she's still in prison because of fraud charges, thus, leaving her no other choice but to put her newly born daughter for adoption. Immediately after her release, she goes in search for the child. And to her surprise, she learns that her daughter is actually under the care of the child's biological father, Arturo (Gardo Versoza) and his new wife Sylvanna (Cherie Gil). Insistent to get her daughter back, Vivian relentlessly kidnaps her. And in line with her plan of starting a new life, she brings her daughter far away to the city and she changes their names. Vivian is now Rosanna and her daughter is named Rubi (Xyriel Manabat). Vivian's possessive lover Danilo (Alan Paule) located them. She conned him while inside prison to help her with her parole. After getting her parole, she escapes from him, leaving him looking like an idiot. He now wants to take revenge on Rosanna and her family. Rubi (Khaycee Aboloc) escapes but became lost in the city. In order to survive, she knocks on car windows to ask for alms. For months, she spent time alone in the busy streets. But fortunately, her time alone is immediately cut short by her unexpected reunion with her mother who has been searching for her all those times. On the other hand, since Sylvanna is still longing for their lost daughter, which is now Rubi, she then decides to adopt a child named Maribel (Shaina Magdayao). But unfortunately for the poor child, she encounters a terrible car accident while driving with her foster father, thus, marking a permanent damage on her left leg. =Years pass= Though they lack the cash, Rubi (Angelica Panganiban) all grown up continuously lives in luxury. Apparently, her mother insistently spoils her with extravagance to make up for their uncalled for separation before. Rubi grew up to become a beautiful young woman and she is not afraid to flaunt her looks. She has an ambition of marrying a wealthy man to get out of the slums that they live in and for her to finally afford all her luxuries. Even though she knows that she couldn't practically afford it, Rosanna strives hard to send Rubi in a prestigious private school. On their way to inquire about admissions, Rubi accidentally comes across Maribel. She learns that Maribel has an inferiority complex because of her disability and upon realizing that the young lady is filthy rich, Rubi instantly decides to befriend the disabled young lady. Maribel invites Rubi over to her house so that she could meet her parents. And immediately, the charming young lady gains the couple's favor. And since she had finally earned Maribel's trust, Rubi gets a peep in her new friend's life. Maribel gladly introduces Hector (Diether Ocampo), her long-time chat-mate, to her. Aside from that, the young lady also discloses the fact that she is in fact an adopted daughter. Through Maribel and her family, Rubi gets a taste of the good life. Maribel showers her with nice clothes, shoes, gadgets in exchange for Rubi's \\"friendship\\". Little does Maribel know that deep within the warm smiles of Rubi, her best friend harbors deep envy of her social status. Her envy went deeper when she discovered that she is the real daughter of Arturo and not Maribel. She thinks that Maribel's life should have been hers. =Things become more complicated= Maribel tells Rubi that her long time chat mate, Hector will be coming for them to meet face to face. Since Maribel is shy about meeting Hector, Rubi sets Maribel up on a date with Hector and Hector and Maribel immediately fell in love despite her disability. Hector introduces his best friend Alejandro who soon falls in love with Rubi. After thinking Alejandro was rich, Rubi flirts with him and as time passes, she develops feelings for him but when she discovered that Alejandro is not rich and is only a scholar by Hector's family, she slowly became cold to Alejandro and goes after Hector. Alejandro does not know why Rubi is slowly drifting away from him. She seduced Hector behind her bestfriend's back. The night before Hector and Maribel's wedding, Rubi gave herself to Hector. Hector completely lost judgement and chose Rubi instead of his fianc√©. He then abandons Maribel at their wedding and marries Rubi instead. Upon realizing the truth, Alejandro and Hector's friendship was completely broken because they realized they are in love with one woman. Alejandro and Maribel felt betrayed by the actions of their best friends. Chaos also ensued at the families of Hector and Maribel because of what they have done. Rubi also revealed her mother's and Arturo's relationship which destroyed Maribel's family. Sylvanna was furious at Rubi but Rubi now has wealth to use against her. She thought she would get her rights to Arturo's wealth when this secret is revealed but Arturo still sided with Maribel because he knew of Rubi's true intentions. In the midst of the chaos, Alejandro and Maribel were left with each other. As time passed by, they slowly became attracted with each other. Alejandro in love with Maribel still harbors feelings for Rubi. On the other hand, Rubi realizes that she is not completely happy with being rich. She hates the fact that Alejandro is dating Maribel and wants him for herself. Hector becomes insecure about his wife especially when she's with Alejandro during social and charity functions which she uses to flirt with him. Rubi continues her scheming to get more money from Hector's family since she knows her husband is blindly in love with her and knows nothing about her secret plans. Her in-laws try to expose her but she always one step ahead of them. Rubi blackmailed her father-in-law about his affair with another woman with whom he also has a family. She accidentally reveals it later and causes a rift between Hector's parents. One of her plans against Maribel's family backfired on her and it killed her mother. Instead of changing her ways because of the tragedy, Rubi is more determined than ever to get all that she wants. She framed Sylvanna for the tragedy and sent her to prison. She is also starting showing her true colors to her husband. She made a fashion business with her cohort, Loretto just to destroy Maribel's business even though she has no knowledge of how to run a business. She also caused some trouble to her sister's boyfriend Cayetano. She doesn't want him for her sister because he is just a family driver of Maribel's family. She openly criticizes and mocks him and even tried to put him in jail by framing him up with theft. Luckily, she did not succeed and Cayetano was sent free but it caused a rift between Rubi and her sister, Cristina. While Maribel is still dating Alejandro, she catches Rubi and Alejandro kissing. Maribel is devastated while Rubi is delighted by thinking Alejandro still loves her. Alejandro is torn between Maribel and Rubi. Alejandro and Rubi meet one night and they became intimate with each other. Maribel discovers this and decided to go away. Rubi soon becomes pregnant and questions the possibility that it could be Alejandro's baby instead of Hector's. Still unsure, Rubi tells Hector that the baby is his. Meanwhile, Alejandro goes to Maribel's house hoping that Maribel will forgive him, where he finds out that Maribel has left for Europe but still she came back because her love for Alejandro is stronger and she is willing to forgive him. Also, she doesn't want Rubi to see that she is affected of what happened. Hector finds the evidence of the one night Rubi and Alejandro made love and confronts Rubi upon her return home. They get into a heated argument and Hector punches her pregnant stomach and she had a miscarriage. After some tests, it was revealed that Hector killed his own baby. He also discovered Rubi was the cause of his parent's separation. Because of these incidents, Hector completely lost his mind. =Finale= After she recovered, Rubi tried to get back to Hector to talk to him and explain her version of the story. Little did she know that Hector was now deranged. Hector takes Rubi to their unfinished, would-be home still under construction and physically abuses her. Hector then calls Alejandro and pretends that he has become nice, but it was an act so he could kill him. Rubi tries to stop Hector but he accidentally pushes Rubi off the edge of the building. Rubi holds on for dear life while Alejandro arrives. Hector tries to save her but stumbles and falls to his death landing on the pavement below while Rubi falls down with him into the glass near the construction and is rushed to the hospital afterwards. She now realizes that she already had everything; her family, friends, the man that truly loved her, but she deemed it all worthless just for her blind ambitions. Rubi wakes up with a huge scar on her face and her right leg has been amputated. Because of a rare skin condition, the scar would not heal and it would remain permanent. The beauty she uses to deceive everyone is now gone. She finally learns her lesson and even with a heavy heart, she agrees to Maribel and Alejandro's marriage.

Hamengkubuwono V was recrowned after his great-grandfather's death. Upon reaching adulthood, he was styled Prince Mangkubumi. He was made lieutenant colonel in 1839 and colonel in 1847 by Dutch East Indies government.

He also created some royal dances, the most popular was Serimpi dance and its variants, such as Serimpi Kandha, Serimpi Renggawati, Serimpi Ringgit Munggeng, Serimpi Hadi Wulangun Brangta or Serimpi Renggowati, etc. However, his policy was opposed by some court's servants and his own brother, GRM Mustojo. They saw that Hamengkubuwono V's policy would be ashamed of Yogyakarta Palace as a coward, leading to the decline of support towards himself and the rise of support towards GRM Mustojo. The situation was increasingly beneficial to GRM Mustojo after marrying a Bruneian princess and made a close brotherhood with Sultanate of Brunei. Hamengkubuwono V's rule was increasingly cornered after the emergence of internal conflict involving his own 5th wife, Kanjeng Mas Hemawati. Hamengkubuwono V only gained support from his subjects who felt safe and prosperous during his reign.

It opened in 1866 and closed in 1953. At Wells the line made a junction with the Wells and Fakenham Railway and at Heacham it connected with the line from Hunstanton to Kings Lynn.  History  The West Norfolk Junction Railway was opened in August 1866. The line came from Heacham on an single track aimed at exploiting the great arc of coastline between Hunstanton and Yarmouth. 1866 saw the start of a major financial crisis triggered by the collapse of Overend Gurney Bank; the year also saw the outbreak of a \\"cattle plague\\" in North Norfolk which impacted on the cattle receipts on the line. The West Norfolk was amalgamated with the Lynn and Hunstanton Railway in 1872, forming the Hunstanton and West Norfolk Railway, which in turn was acquired by the Great Eastern Railway in 1890. During the Second World War, the railway's strategic coastal location meant that it provided a natural 'rampart' behind which a potential beach invasion could be repelled. For this reason, a line of pillboxes were constructed along the railway. The post-war boom experienced by the King's Lynn to Hunstanton line was not felt on the West Norfolk Junction Railway whose inconveniently sited stations contributed to declining passenger traffic. Passenger services from Wells-next-the-Sea to Heacham were eventually withdrawn from 2 June 1952, but the line remained open to freight. However, following the North Sea flood of 1953, the track between Wells-next-the-Sea and Holkham was so severely damaged that British Railways considered it not worth repairing and the line was closed completely between these two places. Up to the end of its existence, the line was one of the last where one could travel in gas-lit clerestory coaches hauled by Victorian locomotives.  Route  Heacham station, now holiday accommodation At Heacham, services to Wells-next-the-Sea started and terminated in a bay platform to the east of the line, while trains to Hunstanton and King's Lynn departed from the platforms just to the west. The station was rebuilt at least twice, with the Great Eastern Railway adding platform canopies, a turntable and improving the platform buildings. More substantial modifications were carried out by the London and North Eastern Railway in 1937 as Heacham had by then become a significant holiday destination, and it was necessary to extend the passing loop to accommodate 13-coach trains. A lattice girder footbridge linked the platforms, while a signal box was situated on the down side. Sedgeford railway station was the first station after Heacham on the single-track West Norfolk Junction Railway. It was a small station located in a rural area, equipped with a single platform on the down side, built to smaller dimensions to other stations on the Lynn and Hunstanton Railway, and without a stationmaster's residence. Very basic goods facilities were provided in the shape of a single carriage siding on the down side. The station's staff amounted to two persons, reduced to one in the final years. Traffic on the line was largely agricultural, consisting of corn, sugar beet, cattle and agricultural machinery. A level crossing lay to the east of the platform. After passing through Docking, trains arrived at Stanhoe railway station, situated more than a mile from the village from which it took its name; its remote rural location was accentuated by the fact that it lay at a height of around 200 ft above sea level. With no goods facilities provided, the station had one of the simplest layouts on the line; a single platform on the up side on which was built a signal box and single storey station building out of Norfolk flint rather than the usual Great Eastern Carstone. A level crossing lay to the west while the line climbed to the west, running parallel with a minor road before crossing it on a level about a mile from Docking. Burnham Market station, now a hotel, with carriage on track Burnham Market was the principal intermediate station on the West Norfolk branch, serving the largest settlement between Heacham and Wells-next-the-Sea. Its importance was to decline towards the end of the nineteenth century as it shed its urban functions to become the village it is today. A single platform was provided together with a brick station building situated on the down side of the line. A crossing loop to the west of the station allowing it to be a passing place. Four sidings led from the loop to serve a goods yard equipped with a red brick goods shed. Another siding led to a nearby brickworks which used the railway to import coal. The station, like many others along the line, also handled its fair share of agricultural traffic and, in addition, some fish traffic (notably shellfish) from nearby villages such as Brancaster and Burnham Overy.J The station was also the nearest to Lord Nelson's birthplace at Burnham Thorpe, a fact capitalised on by the Great Eastern Railway which erected large nameboards proclaiming that this was the station \\"For Burnham Thorpe & Nelson's Birthplace\\". At Holkham the railway line curved away from the main village centre dominated by Holkham Hall, and followed a path nearer the coast. The line had been opposed by the occupant of Holkham Hall, the Earl of Leicester, who feared that it would lead to large scale resort development and an influx of holiday visitors near his home. A station was nevertheless opened opposite the main gates of Holkham Park which had been laid out by Thomas Coke who had reclaimed from the sea some of the land over which the railway now ran. The station's approach road, Lady Ann's Drive, continued for around half a mile to the beach at Holkham Gap. The station itself was very small, equipped with a single platform and no goods facilities. Architecturally, it was a miniature version of the Great Eastern's \\"Victorian House\\" design, incorporating a small platform canopy. There was a level crossing over Lady Ann's Road which was controlled by a wooden signal box. The line entered Wells-next-the-Sea on a sharp curve, turning through a full 180 degrees before converging with the Wymondham to Wells branch from Dereham for the final approach. West Norfolk services used the outer face of a sheltered wooden island platform to the south of the station, with the inner face being set aside for services to Dereham and Wymondham. The Dereham side was unusual in that there was a platform on either side of the train, allowing the passengers the choice of which side to alight from, much the same as Ventor and Ulverston stations.  Preservation  Sedgeford station, July 2008 The majority of the route remains unobstructed although some of it now traverses open fields with no visible sign of the trackbed. The stations at Heacham, Sedgeford, Stanhoe, Burnham Market and Wells-next-the-Sea remain in good order, and large sections of the route remain in transport use as roadways and drives. For example, at Burnham Market, the former route passes east of the station across a field and is not visible, but the trackbed then survives as a concrete road leading from the south end of Joan Short's Lane to the sewage works, from where it continues as a public footpath through woodland. Holkham station has been demolished, although the WW2 pill boxes remain. The site of Docking station has been redeveloped as a housing estate, although the station house survives as a private residence, and the route into Wells-next-the-Sea has been partially redeveloped as housing, a school playing field and an industrial estate.

Cohen & Dave Samuelson, Songs for Political Action, Bear Family Records BCD 15720 JL, 1996, p. 94). In 1942, Army intelligence and the FBI determined that the Almanacs and their former anti-draft message were still a seditious threat to recruitment and the morale of the war effort among blacks and youth.According to an article in The Amsterdam News, the FBI also came after Billie Holiday, when she sang a pacifist song in the middle of the war, forcing her manager to make her change her repertoire. See Denning (1997), p. 343. and they were hounded by hostile reviews, exposure of their Communist ties and negative coverage in the New York press, like the headline \\"Commie Singers try to Infiltrate Radio.\\"\\"We got to sing [the pro-war song, 'Round and Round Hitler's Grave'] on January '42, on a nationwide CBS broadcast, 'This is War'.

The album represents a change from the anti-war, anti-racism, and pro-union philosophies of most of its members but a continuation of their anti-Nazi, anti-Fascist philosophies in the form for support for the USA and the Allies (which included the USSR). The Union Boys turned out to be a one-time, one session \\"group\\": Moe Asch gave them the name. =Afterwards= A few months later, White and Glazer recorded another album with a similar title, Songs of Citizen CIO. Songs for Victory also began White's association with recording engineer Moe Asch, who released White's next two albums on his Asch Records label.

She carried between 100 and 160 tons of coal and was manned by 120 sailors and officers.

The squadron‚Ä≤s senior admirals formed an international \\"Admirals Council\\" to govern Crete during the intervention, and in early September 1898 they ordered that the customs house at Candia (now Heraklion) be turned over to the British in order to initiate a system of export duties to fund administration of the island. On 6 September 1898, a well-armed Cretan Turkish mob attacked the small force of British soldiers and sailors at the customs house and at the British camp and hospital to the west at the other end of the town. The mob also massacred hundreds of Cretan Christian residents of the town. The only ship of the International Squadron on the scene, Hazard put reinforcements ashore and opened fire on the town with her 4.7-inch (119-mm) guns when Ottoman Army troops charged with keeping order did little to assist the British or Cretan Christian civilians or to restore order.McTiernan, p. 34.Clowes, pp. 447-448.The British in Crete, 1896 to 1913: British JusticeThe British in Crete, 1896 to 1913: Iraklion, 25th August Street‚Ä¶then and now Hazard lost four seamen killed and several wounded; Lieutenant Lewes, the commanding officer of Hazard, was promoted to commander as a result of the action, and Surgeon William Job Maillard was awarded the Victoria Cross.

In 1884 Bowen was part of the Llanelli squad which reached the final of the 1884 South Wales Challenge Cup, facing Newport. Played at Neath, Llanelli beat Newport by one try to nil. In 1886 the same two teams met each other again in the final of the same competition, this time Bowen was captain of Llanelli, having been given the position on the retirement mid-season of Frederick Margrave.Hughes (1986), p.29 When Llanelli were again victorious, their return to the town was celebrated by the locals who greeted them with thousands of rockets and coloured lights. 'Touchstone', the Western Mail's sporting correspondent suggested that Bowen should be \\"memorialized in a tinplate statue\\".Smith (1980), p.2 1884 also saw Bowen move North for a short period, when he signed for Dewsbury; but after playing \\"only a handful of games\\", he returned to play in Wales.Collins (1998), p.56 In 1886 Bowen found himself back in the Welsh squad after Newport's Arthur 'Monkey' Gould, who had taken Charles Lewis' position, switched from full-back into the three- quarters. This gave Bowen three more caps, both games in the 1886 Championship and the opener in 1887. After losing to England in the first game of the 1886 tournament, Wales and Cardiff captain Frank Hancock famously decided to trial the four three-quarter system.Smith (1980), p.61 Although Wales were strong in their fast moving back-play, the power of the Scottish pack, now with a man advantage, began to dominate the forward play. The Welsh forwards appeared loath to give the backs the ball, so during the game the four three-quarter tactic was abandoned and it was decided that Bowen would move into the pack to provide reinforcement, while Gould dropped to full-back. This was seen by some supporters as a 'political' move by the Cardiff captain, sacrificing a Llanelli player to allow Gould the full-back position. The Guardian wrote, \\"to please Cardiff, four three-quarters were played with disastrous results. When room had to be made for a Cardiff man, a Llanellyite, of course, had to make way for him.\\" Bowen would play one more game for Wales, a nil-nil draw with England at Stradey Park in 1887, and was replaced by Hugh Hughes in the next game of the tournament; but Wales had difficulty finding a long-term full-back until the appearance of Billy Bancroft during the 1889/90 season. In 1888, with his international rugby career behind him, Bowen played in his most notable game when he was part of the Llanelli team that face the touring New Zealand Natives. Bowen not only scored a spectacularBillot (1972), p.15 dropped goal from near the halfway line, which brought Llanelli the victory; but also charged down an on target kick at goal form the MƒÅori that would have levelled the game.Billot (1972), p.16 Although Bowen played a vital role in the game, he was not chosen for the Welsh team that faced the MƒÅori three days later at Swansea. In January 1889, Bowen left Llanelli to take up a teaching post in Bangor, North Wales, though he kept a close connection with the club.Hughes (1986) p.36 He was remembered as a diligent captain who \\"kept his eyes all over the field\\" and held the ability to secure obedience from his fellow players.Hughes (1986) p.30 =International matches played= Wales (rugby union)Smith (1980), p.464 * 1882, 1886, 1887 * 1886 As an administrator After retiring from playing rugby, Bowen retained his links with rugby union. On returning to West Wales in 1891 he became an administrator for Llanelli RFC, taking on the role of club secretary.Hughes (1896), p.257 The next year he extended his duties by becoming the club's treasurer, holding both positions until 1897 when the duties were passed to Rhys Harry. Bowen remained on the Llanelli board, and in 1897 he was elected as club chairman, a role he held until 1902. His duties to rugby extended beyond club level as he later became a Welsh selector and a rugby referee.Smith (1980), p.193 He refereed just one international, the 1905 Home Nations Championship encounter between England and Scotland.

The initiative is a partnership between the Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust and international architects RMJM. The project seeks to break down barriers to accessing a career in architecture, urban design, the built environment and related professions, particularly for those from Black, minority ethnic and socially excluded groups. In 2009, Architecture for Everyone attracted the support of several design and education organisations, including The Lighthouse in Glasgow, John Moores University in Liverpool and Rich Mix in London. The Scottish Government, Urban Living (Housing Pathfinder in the West Midlands) and Places Matter! (the north east regional architecture and built environment centre) provided funding for the workshops in Glasgow, Birmingham and Liverpool. As part of the pilot campaign, a national competition and series of workshops in cities around the country identified the most talented young people. Six finalists each won a place on an intensive summer course at the Harvard Graduate School of Design in Boston. Six runners- up were rewarded with a place on the Urban Design Summer School courtesy of CABE. In 2010, the initiative will be following a sporting theme, to tie in with the upcoming London 2012 Olympic Games and Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games. Again, a nationwide series of design workshops will take place with hundreds of young people getting a once-in-a-lifetime chance to explore their creativity and find out more about a career in architecture.

Sargent, with Simon Coley, a design specialist, founded Powershop in September 2007. In September 2008, Powershop bought its predecessor, Meridian Energy's Marketplace Innovations Business Unit, for NZ$1.26 million in stock. After 14 months of private beta, it officially launched to the public on 22 February 2009 and was unofficially available in the weeks prior. Reception Powershop planned on 4‚Äì50,000 customers in its first year. Powershop achieved 5000 customers in October 2009, and 10000 customers in February 2010.

The Consumers' Institute of New Zealand welcomes initiatives to increase retail power competition. In a 2009 survey by the Ministry of Economic Development, Powershop was found to be the cheapest electricity retailer for the typical consumer (one who consumes 8000kWh/year) in Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch, Dunedin, Manawatu and New Plymouth. It was the second cheapest in Whanganui and Wairarapa.Quarterly Survey of Domestic Electricity Prices: Updated to 15 August 2009 In Consumers' Institute of New Zealand's 2009 survey of electricity companies, Powershop gained the highest rating ever in the history of the survey. 92% of Powershop customers found it 'good' or 'very good'. It did not receive a single poor rating from any of its customers. In 2010, it again received a 92% satisfaction rating. In 2011 and again in 2012, it gained a 96% customer satisfaction rating.

(Ron) Stamper (born 1934) is a British computer scientist, formerly a researcher in the LSE and emeritus professor at the University of Twente, known for his pioneering work in Organisational semiotics, and the creation of the MEASUR methodology and the SEDITA framework.  Biography  Born in West Bridgford, United Kingdom, Stamper obtained his MA in Mathematics and Statistics at Oxford University in 1959.Ronald Stamper. \\"RONALD STAMPER, at ICEIS'99; 1st International Conference on Enterprise Information Systems, Set√∫bal, PORTUGAL, 27-30 March, 1999.\\" at iceis.org. Accessed 03-05-2017. Stamper started his career in industry, first in hospital administration and later in the steel industry. He starting applying operational research methods with the use of computers, and evolved into the management of information systems development. In need of more experts, he developed one of the first courses in systems analysis in the UK. In 1969 he moved into the academic world, starting at the London School of Economics as senior lecturer and principal investigator. From 1988 to 1999 he was Professor of Information Management at the University of Twente at its Faculty of Technology and Management. Form 2001 to 2004 he was visiting professor at the Staffordshire University. In 1970s Stamper jointed the work of the International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP), and participated in the IFIP TC8/WG8.1 Task Group Design and Evaluation of Information Systems. In the 1990s he made a significant contribution to its 1998 publication of A Framework of Information System Concepts. The FRISCO Report.  Work  Theoretical foundations of information systems = The main thrust of Stamper's published work is to find a theoretical foundation for the design and use of computer based information systems. He uses a framework provided by semiotics to discuss and prescribe practical and theoretical methods for the design and use of information systems, called the Semiotic Ladder. To the traditional division of semiotics into syntax, semantics and pragmatics, Stamper adds \\"empirics\\". \\"Empirics\\" for Stamper is concerned with the physical properties of sign or signal transmission and storage. He also adds a \\"social\\" level for shared understanding above the level pragmatics. Stamper adopted the idea of the sign as the fundamental unit of informatics after his research into the meaning of the word \\"information\\" which he considered dangerously polysemous. He was concerned to establish an operationalism at the semantic level of information systems rather than the binary level. = LEGally Oriented Language LEGOL = His work at the LSE investigating LEGOL (for LEGally Oriented Language ‚Äì a computerized representation of the law) led him to incorporate the idea of Norms pioneered by Von Wright and the Affordances of Gibson in a system called NORMA (for NORMs and Affordances). Stamper collaborated with Ronald Lee of the University of Texas on organizational deontics incorporating the Speech Acts of Austin and Searle. This led to the broader methodology he called MEASUR (for Methods for Eliciting, Analysing and Specifying Users‚Äô Requirements). Measure incorporated the methods of Problem Articulation, Semantic Analysis and Norm Analysis, and uses the ontology chart. IBM partly sponsored the research into LEGOL at the LSE, and LEGOL 2, was used as an application to test IBM's seminal Peterlee Relational Test Vehicle, the first relational database. Criticism of Stamper's Metaphysics Gregory has criticizedGregory, Frank Hutson (1993) SSM to Information Systems: A Wittgensteinian Approach. Warwick Business School Research Paper No. 65, later published in Journal of Information Systems, 3, pp 149-168. Stamper's discussion of semantics which he says takes him into the area of metaphysics, the theory of meaning and the philosophy of logic. Stamper criticizes Tarski's theory of truth because he claims that it entails a naive belief in one objective reality.Stamper, R. K.(1987) Semantics. In Boland, R. J. and Hirschheim, R. A. Eds. Critical Issues in Information System Systems Research. Wiley, Chichester. Stamper claims that \\"Meanings express personal views of reality. When there is a firmly established consensus, and only then, we can pretend that meanings are independent of people.\\". Gregory proposed that Stamper failed to understand Tarski and put forward a theory of meaning that had already been shown to be false by Wittgenstein's Private Language Argument. However Gregory's analytic account of Stamper underplays the role that deliberate systematic skepticism plays in Stamper's form of actualism, and ignores the falsificationist requirements that Stamper demanded of statements and theories.

Early life Aldolphus Dalrymple was the eldest son of Sir Hew Whiteford Dalrymple and his wife Frances nee Leighton, and was born in St Marylebone. At the time of his birth his father was an officer in the 1st Foot Guards. Adolphus attended Harrow School from 1796‚Äì1799. Military career Dalrymple's father was able to use his social and military connections to advance his son's career in the army. In 1799 Sir Hew was Lieutenant Governor of Guernsey and he obtained a commission for Adolphus, than aged 15, in the 55th (Westmorland) Regiment of Foot that was stationed on the island. In the following year he was promoted to full lieutenant in the 37th (North Hampshire) Regiment of Foot of which his father was colonel, and was appointed his aide de camp. In February 1801 he exchanged to the 1st King's Dragoon Guards, then stationed in England. He quickly obtained another staff appointment as aide de camp to Lieutenant- General Sir James Craig, commanding the Eastern District of England. He was promoted to captain in the 18th Light Dragoons at the beginning of 1803, but had returned to Craig's staff within six months. He remained as the general's aide de camp until May 1806, serving in Malta, Sicily, and Naples. In June 1806 he was appointed military secretary to his father, by then Lieutenant- Governor of Gibraltar. Sir Hew was subsequently appointed to command British forces in Portugal fighting the French, but signed the Convention of Cintra in August 1808 that allowed the defeated French safe passage out of the country. The signing of the convention by his father was seen as a major humiliation by the British public, and Adolphus's military career suffered. Although he was able to purchase promotions as a major in the 3rd (East Kent) Regiment of Foot and the 19th Light Dragoons and as a lieutenant colonel in the 60th (Royal American) Regiment of Foot, he never saw active service again and transferred to the half pay list in 1814. Parliamentary career In 1812 Dalrymple married Anne, daughter of Sir James Graham, 1st Baronet, of Kirkstall, member of parliament for Carlisle. His father-in-law was able to assist him in obtaining a seat in the Commons in 1817 when a vacancy arose at Weymouth and Melcombe Regis. He lost the seat, however, at the 1818 general election. A year later he obtained another seat at Appleby, where his father-in-law was recorder of the borough. In 1826 he changed constituencies to become MP for Haddington Burghs, succeeding a relative, Sir Hew Dalrymple-Hamilton, 4th Baronet. In 1830 his father, who had been created a baronet in 1815, died. Adolphus accordingly inherited the title to become the 2nd Baronet. In the same year he was promoted to colonel and appointed aide de camp to William IV. He lost his Commons seat at the 1832 general election. In 1837 he returned to parliament as one of Brighton's two MPs. In the same year he became aide de camp to the new monarch, Queen Victoria. He held the post until 1841, in which year he also lost his Commons seat. Later life Although no longer active in the army, Dalrymple continued to receive promotions: to major general in 1841, lieutenant general in 1851 and general in 1860. He had a number of homes: High Mark in Wigtownshire, which he had inherited from his father, a house in Grosvenor Square, London, another in Brunswick Terrace, Brighton and Delrow House, Aldenham, Hertfordshire. He died at his Hertfordshire home in 1866 aged 82. As he had no children, the baronetcy expired on his death. He was buried in the family vault at St John's Church, Aldenham.

After serving as one of the first black members of the Women's Army Corps during World War II, she devoted her life to researching and documenting the military service and achievements of black Americans. Following a period of employment with the War Manpower Commission after her discharge from the army, she entered the academic world, earning a PhD at the University of Pennsylvania and pursuing a distinguished teaching career at Bowie State College (now Bowie State University) in Maryland, where she chaired the history and geography department, and later at Howard University, her alma mater, in Washington, D.C. Upon retiring from the faculty at Howard, she embarked on a writing career that included three books and over 20 journal articles. At the time of her death at age 92 she was working on a fourth book portraying the contributions of blacks in combat dating back to the American Revolutionary War. Early life Martha Settle was born to Oliver and Ida Settle of Norristown, Pennsylvania, on November 9, 1916.

The candidate won, and with his help she got a scholarship to Howard University, where she received a bachelor's degree (1939) and master's degree in history (1940).Tom Brokaw, The Greatest Generation, (New York: Random House, 1998, ), p. 185; JBHE Weekly Bulletin - Latest News for 1/15/2009 In Memoriam - Martha S.

She settled instead for a statistical clerk position with the War Manpower Commission. In 1943 she enlisted in the Women's Army Corps, which had been created the previous year. Interviewed years later, she explained her decision this way: \\"The Corps, which was then less than a year old, promised an opportunity to become a commissioned officer. Though I had a master's degree in history, I refused to go any further south for a job, so the promise of a commission was the best option available.\\"Brokaw, p. 187; Joe Holley, \\"Bowie, Howard Historian Martha Putney,\\" Washington Post (December 22, 2008), Obituaries, p.

Women's Army Corps Martha Settle was one of 40 African-American women selected for the Women's Army Corps (WAC) in 1943. She soon earned the rank of Lieutenant and was assigned to a basic training company at Fort Des Moines, Iowa. Her duties there included leading drills and teaching calisthenics. She asked for, and was granted, permission to attend Adjutant General's School in San Antonio to train for an executive or administrative position. This led to an assignment as commanding officer of a WAC Hospital Company at the Gardiner General Hospital in Chicago, a position she held for the rest of the war.Univ. of Tennessee - Celebrate Freedom 2000 - Speaker Bios , accessed March 5, 2009; Brokaw, p. 187.

She tried to prepare you for discrimination in the sense you had to be very good to be accepted.\\" Most of the students at both Howard and Bowie State were black, and former student William Missouri noted that Dr. Putney would ask unprepared students, \\"How can you be an African American and not want to learn African-American history?\\"Brokaw, p. 191. Writings After retiring from her teaching career, Dr. Putney turned to writing, focusing on the achievement of African Americans in the military. Her first book, Black Sailors: Afro-American Merchant Seamen and Whalemen Prior to the Civil War, published in 1987 by Greenwood Press, was described by one reviewer as \\"A welcome contribution to what amounts to a new field of study, black history and the American maritime service.\\"Greenwood Publishing Group, excerpt from review by Choice, accessed March 7, 2009. Her second book, When the Nation was in Need: Blacks in the Women's Army Corps During World War II (Scarecrow Press, 1992), drew not only on the author's personal experience in the army but also from \\"archival records, manuscripts, documents, contemporary newspaper accounts and interviews, statements, and the personal files of those who served\\".

She also was a frequent contributor to the Northeast News, a community newspaper.Obituaries, The Times Herald of Norristown, Pa., February 4, 2009, accessed March 5, 2009. Other contributions Dr. Putney's chronicling of the military exploits of African Americans was not confined to the written word. She also conveyed these histories through the medium of public speaking. On July 17, 1998, for example, she spoke at a National Park Service ceremony at Ford's Theater in Washington, D.C., occasioned by the inception earlier that year of the Civil War Soldiers and Sailors System.The Civil War Soldiers and Sailors System (CWSS) is an online database developed by the National Park Service, in cooperation with public and private partners, to record the names of and other basic information about those who fought on either side in the American Civil War. The initial deployment of the CWSS in early 1998 included data about the 235,000 members of the United States Colored Troops. For more information about the CWSS see the NPS Civil War Soldiers and Sailors System website . She began her remarks with a reference to the fatal attack on Fort Wagner, South Carolina, by the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry Regiment, noting that \\"numerous accounts and the film 'Glory' have pretty much brought this event to the attention of the general public.\\" She then pointed out that this assault \\"was one of the many battlefield exploits of African Americans during the Civil War. Before the war ended, black troops had been involved in hundreds of skirmishes and engagements including thirty-five major battles.\\" Dr. Putney went on to cite statistics regarding the blacks who served the Union on land and sea: of their 200,000 number, there were \\"some 68,000 casualties; some 37,000 of these lost their lives.\\"Martha Putney, \\"A Historical Overview of African Americans and the Military\\" , remarks delivered at Ford's Theater, July 17, 1998, accessed March 4, 2009.

History This region was rich in natural resources including wild turkeys, bears, deer, elk, and pigeons in large numbers, along with large buffalo herds. The buffalo population dwindled as settlement increased, but were still being hunted in southeastern Ohio as late as 1792. In 1785, Richard Butler gave details of a supper that included \\"fine roast buffalo beef, soup of buffalo beef and turkeys, fried turkeys, fried cat fish, fresh caught, roast ducks, good punch, madeira, claret, grog and toddy\\". The \\"fine venison, bear meat, turkeys and catfish\\" eaten by Butler's party was supplied entirely by hunting and fishing, or in Butler's words \\"procured by themselves at pleasure\\". Venison and turkey were the most popular game, and fish like pike, catfish, sturgeon, pickerel, bass and perch were plentiful. In lean times raccoons, squirrels, opossums and other less desirable game could be consumed. One writer in the Revolutionary era wrote that a hunter could kill six to eight deer each day. Wheat didn't take to the rich soils around Ohio so wheat bread remained a rare luxury, and many crops were hard to come by in the early years. When The Ohio Company settled Marietta in the spring of 1788 they planted potatoes, turnips, pumpkins, corn, squash, melons, beans and cucumbers. Unexpectedly harsh weather in 1789 destroyed the crops that year leading to severe food shortages in what came to be called \\"the starving year\\". Pork was usually preserved by various methods, the most common being brining in a pork barrel, but hogs were few in number and salt had to be carried across the Allegheny Mountains to reach the Ohio Company settlement. By winter's end many families had run out of cornmeal, and even the wealthiest families were left with little more than a few potatoes. At the first signs of spring pioneers gathered nettles and purslane, but it wasn't until July that new corn, beans and squash were harvested early and made into soup. In 1792 Jack Heckewelder described corn, barley, potatoes, turnips, oats, millet, and wheat growing in Cincinnati, and though settlement in the area was still sparse a garrison of around 200 at Fort Washington had planted \\"very fine\\" vegetable gardens. Buckwheat cakes were common, and the travel journal of Francis Bailey from 1797 notes that settlers extracted the syrup of sugar maples and depended on game meats like wild turkey and venison during the winter months. Specialties Buckeye candy Buckeye candy is a local specialty, popular in the state of Ohio. The confection is a variation of standard peanut butter cups known as a 'Buckeye'. Coated in chocolate, with a partially exposed center of peanut butter fudge, the candy resembles the appearance of the nut that grows on the state tree, commonly known as the buckeye. Cincinnati-style chili is a Greek-inspired meat sauce, (ground beef seasoned with cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, cloves, bay leaf, cumin, chili powder, and in some home recipes, chocolate), used as a topping for spaghetti or hot dogs. Additionally, red beans, chopped onions, and shredded cheese are offered as extra toppings referred to as \\"ways.\\" A popular snack food in Ohio are Sauerkraut Balls, a meatball-sized fritter containing sauerkraut and some combination of ham, bacon, and pork. The recipe was invented in the late 1950s by two brothers, Max and Roman Gruber for their five star restaurant, Gruber's, located in Shaker Heights, Ohio. These were a derivative of the various ethnic cultures of Northeast Ohio, which includes Akron and Greater Cleveland. An annual Sauerkraut Festival is held in Waynesville, Ohio. at which sauerkraut balls, along with other sauerkraut specialities, are served. Clam bakes are very popular in Northeast Ohio. The region, which was originally part of the Connecticut Western Reserve, was initially settled by people from Connecticut and other New England states. A typical Northeast Ohio clam bake typically includes clams, chicken, sweet potatoes, corn, and other side dishes. Unlike in New England, seaweed is not used and the clams, chicken, and sweet potatoes are all steamed together in a large pot. Barberton, Ohio, part of the greater Akron area, is a small industrial city and home of Barberton Chicken, a dish of chicken deep fried in lard that was created by Serbian immigrants. It is usually accompanied by a hot rice dish, vinegar coleslaw and french fries. Mansfield, Ohio is the home of both Stewart‚Äôs Restaurants, creator of Stewart‚Äôs Fountain Classics Sodas, and Isaly Dairy Company, creator of the famed Klondike bar ice cream, both now sold world-wide.

The film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in Canada on 11 September 2006 and was also shown at the Max Oph√ºls Festival in Germany, the Karlovy Vary Film Festival in the Czech Republic, the Copenhagen International Film Festival in Denmark and the Ourense International Film Festival in Spain. There is a 2014 Korean film, Haemoo, with the same story which is attributed to a 2007 stage play by the same name. Plot The film begins showing a group of farmers from China's Fujian province speaking to a Snakehead (a smuggler of people), telling him the false stories they will use for sympathy in the West. The Providence, a Scottish fishing trawler from Peterhead, lands at the docks in Oostende, Belgium where all of the crew but the Skipper (Lewis) debark. His son, Se√°n (Compston), the ship's crewman, Riley (Mullan), and the cook (Robertson) then go to an all- night caf√© before splitting up; Se√°n phones and goes to meet a contact, Riley visits a local brothel and the cook remains at the caf√©. Se√°n meets his contact, a local man named Pol (Hark Bohm), in a dockside warehouse in the hope of being paid to smuggle cigarettes tax-free. Pol has no cigarettes, however, and instead offers Se√°n a large sum of money to smuggle a group of Chinese immigrants into the United Kingdom. Se√°n reluctantly agrees as he and his father are heavily indebted after failing to catch enough fish to pay the mortgage. Riley returns to find the refugees aboard the ship, but he and Se√°n agree not to inform the Skipper or the cook. The Chinese are kept below deck in poor conditions but one, a 12-year-old girl named Su Li (Angel Li), sneaks off and lives in another part of the boat. She begins to steal food from the kitchen but the slow-witted cook eventually notices that some of his food is missing. Se√°n insists they can't go home without a good catch as an empty boat would look suspicious and the cargo hold may be searched and the Chinese stowaways discovered. The nets come up near empty almost every time, though, and the conditions in the hold are beginning to deteriorate rapidly. When one of the Chinese stowaways dies, Riley goes to the Skipper and confesses all. The Skipper confronts Se√°n but soon realises that he was simply doing what was in the ship's, and their, best interests. For the first time, the Skipper is forced to acknowledge that he's only making a loss by staying at sea. Broken, he gives the wheel to Se√°n, who turns for home. Meanwhile, the cook discovers Su Li and comforts her, but does not inform anyone else of her presence on board the ship. The Skipper believes that if they return to Scotland, they will face certain arrest; he will lose his license, and the bank will foreclose on the boat. He drowns the immigrants without telling anyone. Se√°n and Riley then see the nets are full and pull them up. The crew is horrified to find the corpses. The cook attacks the Skipper with a chain and kills him, as he would have no choice but to kill Su Li also. The film then ends with Riley and Su Li sitting at a bus stop in Peterhead, Scotland. Su Li gets on a coach and it drives away. Inside her bag is the large sum of money from the ship.

The cut was dug between 1930 and 1935, taking the river on a straight course between Weybridge and Walton, and avoiding a meandering stretch past Shepperton and Lower Halliford. It is a very slight curve long. Its geodesic length is as the crow flies, and its construction created Desborough Island. Two bridges were built across the cut to link to the island, which contains a water treatment works and a large extent of open space used for recreation. The cut alleviated flooding in SheppertonShepperton Rotary Club and halved the distance of travel on that part of the river.

Known as \\"America's Dairyland\\", Wisconsin is famous for its cheese and other dairy products, such as frozen custard. Other notable foods unique to the region include bratwursts, beer and Old Fashioned cocktails, butter burgers, fish fries and fish boils, and booyah stew. Dairy Wisconsin is home to numerous frozen custard stands, particularly around Milwaukee, Wisconsin and along the Lake Michigan corridor. The state also has a special relationship with Blue Moon ice cream, being one of the only places the flavor can be found. While the flavor's origins are not well documented, it was most likely developed by flavor chemist Bill \\"Doc\\" Sidon of Milwaukee. Scratch Ice Cream is a small-batch brand of ice cream founded in Milwaukee. =Cheese= Fried cheese curds The state is also well known as a home to many cheesemakers. Currently, Wisconsin boasts 58 Master Cheesemakers, who are all qualified through an extensive process set by the Wisconsin Milk Marketing Board. The program is the only one of its kind outside of Europe. However, Wisconsin cheesemaking is even more diverse, ranging from artisans who hand-craft their product from the milk of their own dairy herds to large factories. Colby cheese was first created in Wisconsin in 1885 (named after the town it came from), and Brick cheese was first created in the state in 1877. The state has also played origin to Blue Marble Jack cheese, and is the only producer of Limburger cheese in the United States. Cheese curds can be eaten separately \\"squeaky,\\" or cold, as a snack, or covered in batter and fried as an appetizer, often served with ranch dressing as a dipping sauce. Hot and spicy cheese bread is a food created and popularized in Madison, Wisconsin. Dessert Kringle, the official state pastry Arguably the most universal Wisconsin dessert would be the cream puff, a type of profiterole that is a famous treat at the Wisconsin State Fair. The southeastern Wisconsin city of Racine is known for its Danish kringle, a sweet flaky pastry often served as a dessert. The kringle became the official state pastry of Wisconsin on June 30, 2013.\\"Kringle becomes Wisconsin state pastry\\". WTMJ, July 1, 2013. Accessed July 26, 2013. Madison was home to Carson Gulley, a famous local African American chef of the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison from the 1920s to the 1950s. He is credited with creating the famous dessert Fudge-Bottom pie and spreading its popularity. AlcoholBeer= RumChata was invented in Pewaukee, Wisconsin Platter of fish boil, which is traditionally served in Door County Besides its \\"Cheesehead\\" status, Wisconsin has a reputation for alcohol consumption. Common traits of \\"drinking culture\\" are embedded in Wisconsin traditions, from festivals and holidays to everyday life. Many large breweries were founded in Wisconsin, largely in Milwaukee, which gained the epithet \\"Brew City\\" before the turn of the century: Miller, Pabst, Schlitz (all from and originally based in Milwaukee) and Leinenkugel all began as local favorites before entering the national and international markets. Wisconsin has experienced a resurgence in this industry, however, with numerous microbreweries and craft beers now being created and exported. Several other favorites include Ale Asylum, Capital, Sprecher, and New Glarus, the latter being well known for the Spotted Cow Farmhouse Ale. =Other= Besides beer, Wisconsinites also drink large quantities of brandy, often mixed into the unique Badger libation, the \\"brandy Old Fashioned,\\" which can be sweet, sour, or press. Another though considerably more recent brandy-based cocktail is the Wisconsin Badger, derived from a mix of brandy, cranberry juice, and cherry schnapps‚Äîall very Wisconsin-inspired ingredients. Pewaukee, Wisconsin is also home to the alcoholic beverage RumChata, described as an horchata recipe containing the primary ingredients of rum and Wisconsin cream. Cooking with alcohol is also quite standard across the state. Wisconsinites commonly boil or braise their sausages (especially bratwursts) in several types of beer (most often a pilsner) with butter and onions, and \\"Beer batter\\" fish, typically walleye or perch, as well as cheese curds and onion rings are also common fare. Beer cheese soup is another beloved recipe, usually made from a variety of beer and a sharp cheddar or more mild colby cheese, with sausage, potatoes, and green onions. Another ubiquitous but perhaps less- mentioned recipe involving alcohol is \\"Beer Butt\\" or \\"Beer Can\\" Chicken (similar to drunken chicken), a vernacular meal involving a whole chicken slow-roasted, typically over a fire, with a can of usually amber beer directly inserted into the poultry's cavity; the result being a tender meat soaked inside with the flavors of the beer chosen. Bratwurst and sausage Wisconsin cuisine also features a large amount of sausage, or wurst (German for \\"sausage\\"). The state is also a major producer and consumer of summer sausage, as well as the nation's top producer and consumer of brats. Brats are typically boiled in a mix of beer, butter, and onions, served on a bratwurst bun, and topped with sauerkraut and often a spicy, brown style mustard. The city of Madison, Wisconsin, the state's capital, plays host to the annual \\"World's Largest\\" Brat Fest, a four-day-long festival incorporating music, recreational activities, and of course bratwursts grilled on a 65-foot-long grill. At Miller Park in the city of Milwaukee, Wisconsin's deep affection for sausage plays out in the Sausage Race, a mascot race involving racing sausage mascots representative of some of the most common sausages found in the state: bratwurst, kielbasa, Italian sausage, the hot dog, and chorizo. Venison sausage, Andouille sausage, and Belgian trippe are a few other common sausages found in the state, though they do not constitute a part of the Sausage Race. Miller Park is also notable for being the only U.S. stadium in which brats outsell hot dogs. Other Booyah seasoned with peas, granulated vegetables and chicken The Friday night fish fry, often battered and fried perch or walleye, is traditional throughout Wisconsin, while in northeast Wisconsin along Lake Michigan and the Door County the fish boil is more popular. The supper club is another common phenomenon of Wisconsin culinary heritage and often a destination for fish frys, which usually feature a portion of aforementioned fish, along with various sides: a fried food such as french fries and onion rings are common, along with condiments of tartar sauce and cole slaw (especially crimson slaw, a variety of cole slaw that incorporates Wisconsin's cranberries) and garnishes of parsley and lemon wedges. \\"Booyah\\" is another very common and hearty Wisconsin meal, found especially in the Northeast region of the state. The origins of this dish are disputed, but the Wisconsin origin contends that the word is a vernacular Flemish or Walloon Belgian spelling of the French word bouillon, in this context meaning \\"broth.\\" Recipes vary but common ingredients usually involve chicken or other meats‚Äîbeef, pork, or ox tail are most often used‚Äîas well as a mirepoix of vegetables, commonly onion, celery, carrots, cabbage, peas, potatoes, and rutabaga. The ingredients are all cooked together in a special kind of large, cast-iron kettle often known as a \\"booyah kettle,\\" over low heat for several days. Seymour, Wisconsin, claims to be the birthplace of the modern hamburger, although several other locations make similar claims. Certainly, however, the \\"Butter Burger\\" is a uniquely Wisconsin take on the classic American dish. Traditionally, a pad of butter is worked or \\"stuffed\\" into the raw hamburger patty before grilling. Dane County Farmers' Market in Madison is the largest producers-only farmer's market in the nation.

LA's Promise High Schools Achieve 84 Point API Gains, September 7, 2011 The school's model of shared leadership between LAUSD and LA's Promise became a new model teamwork between the private and public sectors for public school operation.http://www.laschools.org/news/item?item_id=4786042 LAUSD Press Release In 2008, LA's Promise became one of four nonprofit organizations known as \\"Network Providers\\" working within LAUSD's newly created iDesign Schools Division to create the speedy turnaround of a select number of LAUSD's lowest performing schools. iDesign Schools Division - Network Providers Among the four Network Partners is the Partnership for Los Angeles Schools (PLAS), a nonprofit created by Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa to drive his school reform agenda.https://articles.latimes.com/2008/jul/01/local/me- partnership1 Los Angeles Times, July 1, 2008 Mission LA‚Äôs Promise, a nonprofit organization, is working to radically shift the education, health and social outcomes for thousands of youth in one South Los Angeles community. This will accomplish a ‚Äúneighborhood turnaround‚Äù in an area called LA‚Äôs Promise Neighborhood. History LA‚Äôs Promise founders have served students in the South Los Angeles community for over 15 years. LA‚Äôs Promise began as an organization called Center for Innovative Education (IE) in 2003 with a 60-student cohort at Manual Arts High School. In the subsequent years, the organization expanded the number of students they served and reincorporated itself into MLA Partner Schools. Four years later, Manual Arts High School and West Adams High School joined MLA Partner Schools through the iDesign Division of the Los Angeles Unified School District. In 2011, John Muir Middle School joined MLA Schools through LAUSD‚Äôs Public School Choice. =Reorganization= In April 2011, MLA Partner Schools changed its name to LA's Promise. In March of the same year, the LAUSD school board voted to give control of John Muir Middle School to LA's Promise. =Neighborhood Turnaround= LA's Promise Neighborhood is an 8.2 square-mile enrollment zone that includes West Adams Preparatory High School, Manual Arts High School and John Muir Middle School. There are approximately 150,000 residents in LA's Promise Neighborhood and slightly over 20,000 youth between the ages of 12-18. The average student population is approximately 80% Latino and 20% African American. Schools LA's Promise currently operates three schools: West Adams Preparatory High School, Manual Arts High School, and John Muir Middle School. =West Adams Preparatory High School= West Adams Preparatory High School opened and joined LA's Promise in 2007. The current principal is Dr. Jose Iniguez. There are 2,635 students enrolled in grades 9th-12th. Student demographics are 89% Latino, 10% African American and 1% Asian. West Adams Preparatory High School and LA's Promise (then called MLA Partner Schools) received increased notoriety through its association with famed chef and activist Jamie Oliver when they were featured as a primary plot element in the second season of his television show, Jamie Oliver's Food Revolution, on ABC. Jamie Oliver worked with students in West Adams Preparatory High School's culinary program and encouraged healthy eating habits at the school. =Manual Arts High School= Manual Arts High School opened in 1909 and joined LA's Promise in 2009. The current principal is Erica Thomas-Minor. There are 3,577 students enrolled in grades 9th-12th. Student demographics are 82% Latino and 18% African American. In November 2011, American pop group The Black Eyed Peas surprised 35 Manual Arts students involved in the Robo-Skunk team as they were listening to a presentation by Ubisoft explaining the makings of their new video game The Black Eyed Peas Experience. The surprise visit by Fergie, Taboo, and apl.de.ap was a result of a collaboration between Manual Arts High School, LA's Promise and FIRST‚Äì an organization devoted to inspiring young people to be science and technology leaders. Led by Manual Arts teacher, Mr. John Santos, the Robo‚ÄìSkunk team is composed of Manual Arts High School students that are members of the Imaging, Sciences, and Technology Academy (ISTA) and the Math Engineering and Science Achievement (MESA) Program. =John Muir Middle School= John Muir Middle School opened in 1922 and joined LA's Promise in 2011. The current principal is Aminika Readeux. There are 1,818 students enrolled in grades 6th-8th. Student demographics are 76% Latino and 23% African American. In December 2011, John Muir Middle School hosted AEG's (Anschutz Entertainment Group) Season of Giving Day of Service in conjunction with City Year and LA's Promise. Over 100 volunteers and staff helped beautify the campus of John Muir Middle School by painting murals in the gymnasium, dance studio, hallways and exterior walls. Online Directory and Partner Organizations LA's Promise connects students and families in the LA's Promise Neighborhood to resources which range from tutoring, health screenings, legal services and employment support through their Online Directory.

The Chromatron offered brighter images than conventional color television systems using a shadow mask, but a host of development problems kept it from being widely used in spite of years of development. Sony eventually abandoned it in favor of their famous Trinitron system using an aperture grille. HistoryColor television= Color television had been studied even before commercial broadcasting became common, but it was only in the late 1940s that the problem was seriously considered. At the time, a number of systems were being proposed that used separate red, green and blue signals (RGB), broadcast in succession. Most systems broadcast entire frames in sequence, with a colored filter (or \\"gel\\") that rotated in front of an otherwise conventional black and white television tube. Because they broadcast separate signals for the different colors, all of these systems were incompatible with existing black and white sets. Another problem was that the mechanical filter made them flicker unless very high refresh rates were used. In spite of these problems, the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) selected a sequential-frame 144 frame/s standard from CBS as their color broadcast standard in 1950.Ed Reitan, \\"CBS Field Sequential Color System\\" , 24 August 1997 RCA worked along different lines entirely, using the luminance- chrominance system. This system did not directly encode or transmit the RGB signals; instead, it combined these colors into one overall brightness figure, the \\"luminance\\". Luminance closely matched the black and white signal of existing broadcasts, allowing it to be displayed on existing televisions. This was a major advantage over the mechanical systems being proposed by other groups. Color information was then separately encoded and folded into the signal as a high-frequency modification to produce a composite video signal - on a black and white television this extra information would be seen as a slight randomization of the image intensity and just appear blurry, but the limited resolution of existing sets made this invisible in practice. On color sets, the signal would be extracted, decoded back into RGB, and displayed. Although RCA's system had enormous benefits, it had not been successfully developed because it was difficult to produce suitable display tubes. Black and white TVs used a continuous signal and the tube could be coated with an even painting of phosphor. With RCA's system, the color was changing continually along the line, which was far too fast for any sort of mechanical filter to follow. Instead, the phosphor had to be broken down into a discrete pattern of colored spots. Focusing the right signal on each of these tiny spots was beyond the capability of electron guns of the era. RCA's early experiments used three-tube projectors, or mirror-based systems known as \\"Triniscope\\".Ed Reitan, \\"RCA Dot Sequential Color System\\" , 28 August 1997 =Shadow masks= RCA eventually solved the problem of displaying the color images with their introduction of the shadow mask. The shadow mask consists of a thin sheet of aluminum with tiny holes photo etched into it, placed just behind the front surface of the picture tube. Three guns, arranged in a triangle, were all aimed at the holes. Stray electrons at the edge of the beam were cut off by the mask, creating a sharply focused spot that was small enough to hit a single colored phosphor on the screen. Since each of the guns aimed at the hole from a slightly different angle, the spots of phosphor on the tube could be separated slightly to prevent overlap. The disadvantage of this approach was that for any given amount of gun power, the shadow mask filtered out the majority of the signal. To ensure there was no overlap of the signal on the screen, the dots had to be separated and covered perhaps 25% of its surface. This led to very dim images, requiring much greater power in order to provide a useful picture. Moreover, the system was highly dependent on the relative angles of the beams between the three guns, which required constant adjustment by the user to ensure the guns hit the correct colors. In spite of this, the technical superiority of the RCA system was overwhelming compared to the CBS system, and was selected as the new NTSC standard in 1953. The first broadcast using the new standard occurred on New Year's Day in 1954, when NBC broadcast the Tournament of Roses Parade.Jack Gould, \\"Television in Review: NBC Color\\", The New York Times, 4 January 1954 In spite of this early start, only a few years after regularly scheduled television broadcasting had begun, consumer uptake of color televisions was very slow to start. The dim images, constant adjustments and high costs had kept them in a niche of their own. Low consumer acceptance led to a lack of color programming, further reducing the demand for the sets in a chicken or the egg situation. In the United States in 1960, only 1 color set was sold for every 50 sets sold in total.Sony, p. 42. =Chromatron= In 1951 Ernest Lawrence, a 1939 Nobel Prize winner and professor at University of California, Berkeley best known as the father of the cyclotron, patented a new solution to the color decoding problem. This system, the \\"Chromatron\\" or simply \\"Lawrence Tube\\", used an electronic focusing system in place of RCA's mechanical solution.Cathode Ray patent. The system consisted of a series of thin metal wires or plates placed about -inch behind the phosphor screen. The wires were used to electrically focus the beams and bend them onto the correct phosphors, which were arranged in vertical stripes. The phosphor covered over 50% of the screen's area, whereas the contemporary shadow masks covered about 25%. This led to much brighter images using the same amount of power. Each focusing element consisted of a pair of wires, and a conductive aluminum coating on the back of the phosphors. The screen was normally charged with a potential of 3000 to 4500 V between the wires and the aluminum, resulting in a curved electric field between the grid and the screen. When the electron beam from the gun entered the region between the grid and the screen it was accelerated and focused down to a tiny spot, normally impinging on the green phosphor. By varying the relative voltage between the two wires in each pair, the beam would be bent one direction or the other, allowing control over the color. Unlike a shadow mask, all of the signal eventually reached the screen, further reducing power requirements.Summary. If the chrominance signal was missing, or deliberately ignored, the focusing system was disconnected and its power added to the gun. This produced a slightly stronger and unfocused beam, which hit all three colored strips and produced a B&W; image. The spaces between the stripes meant the overall image would be about as bright as a conventional B&W; set. A shadow mask set required all three guns to be powered to produce a B&W; image, and since the color spots were small, their power had to be very high. Yet another advantage of the near-screen focusing was that the electron beam was bent to hit the phosphors on the tube's faceplate at right angles no matter what the angle of the beam was behind the focuser. This allowed the tubes to be built with much higher deflection angles than conventional tubes - 72 degrees as opposed to a more typical 45. Chromatron tubes thus had much less depth for any given horizontal size. The Chromatron also had several disadvantages. One was that there was a fundamental ratio between the acceleration provided by the grid and the electron gun at the back of the tube; in order to ensure that the grid could successfully control the beam, it had to have a significant proportion of the overall power. Unfortunately the mechanical layout of the grid limited it to voltages of about 5000 V or less, which in turn limited the electron gun to relatively low voltages around 8000 V. Thus the overall power in the Chromatron was less than in conventional tubes, offsetting its natural brightness to some degree.History The more pressing concern was the mechanical layout of the grid. Getting the fine wires to stay aligned with the strips of color on the screen proved to be the design's Achilles heel. =Commercial developments= The University of California, Berkeley set up \\"Chromatic Television Laboratories\\" to commercially develop the system, in partnership with Paramount Pictures who provided development funding. They started producing the PDF 22-4 22-inch prototype tubes in 1952 and 1953, with a display area of 14 by 11 inches. In practice the design proved to have serious problems. Since the focusing system had to quickly move the beam to generate the correct colors, very high voltages and powers had to be used, leading to arcing problems and radio frequency (RF) noise. Around 50 watts of RF power had to be applied to the wires to deflect the electron beam, directing it to the right colored stripe.https://www.earlytelevision.org/chromatron.html The latter was particularly annoying when used as the basis of a television, as the noise interfered with the radio receivers that picked up the broadcasts. The University eventually abandoned their interest in Chromatron, but Paramount continued development as a system for displaying film during editing, which meant that the RF noise did not present a problem. Development was still continuing in the early 1960s when their work was bought by Sony. In spite of these problems, the promise of the Chromatron system was so great that a number of companies continued development of the system throughout the 1950s. The Chromatron design was also licensed for a variety of other uses; Litton Industries used the Chromatron with a two-color display (blue-red) as the basis for an Identification Friend or Foe system. =Sony's attempt= By 1961 Sony was a major Japanese manufacturer of black and white sets, but had no color television technology at all. Sony dealers were asking when they could expect a color set, and the sales division started putting pressure on engineering to simply license a shadow mask design from another maker and start production. Masaru Ibuka refused, apparently displaying an intense personal feeling that the shadow mask design was fundamentally flawed. In March 1961 Ibuka, Akio Morita and Nobutoshi Kihara attended the IEEE trade show at the New York Coliseum. This was Kihara's first visit to the U.S., and he spent considerable time wandering the show floor. At the small Autometric booth he saw the Chromatron being displayed, and hurried to find Morita and Ibuka to show them. When Morita saw the display he immediately started negotiating a meeting for the next morning to visit the Chromatic labs in Manhattan.Sony refers to Chromatic Television by the name \\"Autometric Laboratories\\", although no other reference mentions this name. By the end of the meeting the next day, Morita had secured a license to produce \\"a Chromatron tube and color television receiver utilizing it.\\"Sony, p. 43 In early 1963 Senri Miyaoka was sent to the Chromatic labs to arrange the transfer of the technology to Sony, which would lead to the closing of Chromatic. He was unimpressed with the labs, describing the windowless basement as \\"squalor\\".Sony, p. 44. The American team was quick to point out the flaws in the Chromatron design, telling Miyaoka that the design was hopeless. By September 1964, a 17 inch prototype had been built in Japan, but mass-production test runs were demonstrating serious problems. Ibuka remained a staunch supporter of the technology and pressed ahead with the construction of a new factory to produce them near ≈åsaki Station in Tokyo. This proved unwise; in early runs only 1 to 3 tubes would be usable out of every 1,000 produced. The rest suffered from alignment problems, with the colors fading from one to another across the screen, impossible to fix after the tube was sealed. Usable tubes were quickly rushed to Sony showrooms in spite of the low yields, and Ibuka make the product Sony's top sales priority. This too proved unwise; the low yields meant that the production cost was about 400,000 yen, but Sony was forced to sell them at 198,000 yen ($500) in order to be competitive. The production problems were never solved, and led to increasing tension between Ibuka and Morita. In November 1966 Kazuo Iwama told Susumu Yoshida that the company was close to ruin, and that the team had to improve the yields by the end of the year, or the product would have to be cancelled. Meanwhile, RCA was making great progress improving their shadow mask technology, and new entrants like General Electric's \\"Porta-Color\\" offered other advantages. Sony was clearly falling behind the rest of the market by following the Chromatron approach.Sony, p. 45 Ibuka finally announced that he would personally lead the search for an alternative system. His team of 30 engineers and physicists explored a wide variety of approaches in the search for a uniquely Sony system. After reading several of the reports, Ibuka called 29-year-old physicist Miyaoka into his office along with Yoshida, and asked him if his single-gun approach could be made to work. Miyaoka was attempting to leave work for a cello rehearsal, and rashly stated that it would work. The result was the famed Trinitron system, which went on sale in 1968 to wide acclaim.Sony, p. 48 =Limited sales= Prior to sale of the first Trinitron televisions in the United States, a limited number of 7-inch Chromatrons were built and offered for sale in the United States starting in April 1968 as the KV 7010U. These were replaced about three months later by the KV 7010UA Trinitron tube. [1] The Sony KV 7010U CRT used the newly invented Trinitron gun combined with the Chromatron PDA wire grid instead of a shadow mask or aperture grill. Description The basic concept that defined the Chromatron was the near-screen focusing system, which provided the beam resolution needed to accurately hit the individual colored phosphor strips. The grid both focused the signal as well as guided it to the correct colors. The phosphors were silk screened onto the back of the tube in strips 2 mils wide with 2 mil wide gaps between them, and then coated in aluminum to make the screen conductive. Since the grid had to be charged to relatively high voltages, the aluminum coating was fairly thick, which dimmed the image to some extent. The phosphors were patterned in an RGB-BGR-RGB pattern. The focusing grid was aligned so the beam would normally focus down onto the green strips in the middle of each pair of wires. To produce different colors, say blue, the beam would have to be pulled to the right for one pixel, and then to the left for the next. Since the adjacent stripes of phosphors shared one of the wires, this meant that a single voltage setting would produce the blue color on two adjacent pixels. Since a single frame of color television does not consist of a single color, the deflection system had to be continually varied as the beam moved across the screen.

The castle is located in the Zrinski Park, not far from the city's central square, and is the biggest fortification in Meƒëimurje County. It was constructed of hewn stone and red brick, and, during its more than 7-century-long history, subjected to several reconstructions. Today it is partly restored. The castle's main palace houses the Meƒëimurje County Museum, the biggest museum in the county, and its atrium is also used as an outdoor theatre during the summer months. The place was the scene of the Zrinski-Frankopan conspiracy, a significant event in the history of Croatia. On 19 November 2007 ƒåakovec Castle was classified as a protected cultural good in the Register of Cultural Goods of Croatia under No. N-23. History The first fortification was built in the 13th century by Count Dimitrius Cs√°ky, after whom the city of ƒåakovec is named. It was later owned by many other notable families, including the House of Lackoviƒá, the Counts of Celje as well as the House of Ernu≈°t, House of Zrinski, House of Fe≈°tetiƒá and others. Nikola IV Zrinski, Ban (viceroy) of Croatia and hero of Siget, was granted the castle together with the whole area of Meƒëimurje on 12 March 1546 from King Ferdinand as a compensation for his battles against the Ottomans. Nikola IV's great- grandson Nikola VII Zrinski, long-term Ban of Croatia and famous warrior against the Turks, was born in ƒåakovec Castle in 1620 to Juraj V Zrinski and Magdalena Zrinski n√©e Sz√©chy. In his castle, he established and owned a unique book collection named \\"Bibliotheca Zriniana\\". In 1660 the castle was visited by Evliya √áelebi, Turkish traveller and writer, and in 1661 by Jacobus Tollius, Dutch philologist.

Founded in 1848, the Deutsche Schule Lissabon is the oldest German school in the Iberian Peninsula. The school consists of a primary school with kindergarten and a secondary school. Whilst the primary school is mostly attended by German pupils the secondary school is not. In addition to the main campus in Lisbon there is also a campus in Estoril, Cascais.\\"Kontakt\\"/\\"Contactos.\\" German School of Lisbon. Retrieved on May 5, 2016.

However, the school was founded more than once, other dates being 1895, when it was reopened after being closed for economic reasons for some years, 1922 when it was reopened after World War I, and in 1952 when it was reopened after world War II. The current location and the main buildings were inaugurated in 1963.  Schooling  The German School consists of a kindergarten, a primary and a secondary school in Lisbon plus a kindergarten and primary school in Estoril, some 30 km outside Lisbon, where many German immigrants live. In Lisbon, the primary school is physically divided from the secondary school: they have their own playgrounds etc. The buildings of the current primary school were inaugurated in 2008; the former buildings now accommodate the formerly overcrowded kindergartens. = Primary school = After kindergarten the pupils go to the primary school which has grades 1 to 4. Usually there are two classes for each grade with around 20-25 pupils each. In primary school the pupils are mostly Germans, of German descendants or Portuguese children who had previously lived in Germany and thus speak German already. Classes are taught in German. Portuguese classes start in the second grade as \\"PaF\\", \\"Portugiesisch als Fremdsprache\\" (\\"Portuguese for foreigners\\"). After primary school the pupils are evaluated and a recommendation is made in which of the three categories of the German school system they should continue.(Hauptschule, Realschule, Gymnasium). However, the DSL does not have different classes for the categories, but students that are Haupt- or Realschule get a bonus on their marks. = Secondary school = Beginning with the fifth grade, each year has four classes, two with German as the main language and two further in Portuguese; thus it is able to call itself a \\"Begegnungsschule\\" (\\"school of encounters\\"). Whilst the two lines are separated at first, the pupils are mixed again in the seventh grade, whereafter more and more subjects are taught to mixed German/Portuguese classes, beginning in the seventh grade with subjects such as English, French, music, arts etc. In the tenth grade the classes are mixed again according to the subjects that pupils choose (biology, chemistry, French, art, music, etc.). The school ends after the Abitur, which is held at the end of the twelfth grade. The Abitur allows the pupils to attend any university in Germany. To attend Universities in Portugal, students must take special classes (called Equival√™ncia) during the last years of attendance, which will teach them subjects necessary to later on attend a university in Portugal.  Student body  As of 2009 the school had 1,154 students. 60% of the students were Portuguese. Germans made up most of the remaining students. As of 2009 many German students have parents working for the German embassy and/or for German companies such as Siemens and Volkswagen. Those students tend to stay for around two to three years; once their parents' jobs move, they leave EAL.  Deutsche Schule Estoril  The School has a small dependency in Estoril/Cascais some 30 km outside Lisbon called Deutsche Schule Estoril/Escola Alem√£ do Estoril. It has a kindergarten and first to third (previously until fourth) grade classes. After third grade pupils have to go to the school in Lisbon. The school is in an old villa and attended almost entirely by German pupils. Since space in the school is very limited many German children in the area have to go to Lisbon anyway, which means getting up around two hours earlier for a one-hour drive to the main school. For many years plans to expand the Estoril branch have been in place but nothing has happened so far. The school has its own headmaster but is officially a part of the school in Lisbon.

Plot Marco (Michael Parks), a young, arrogant art student, is friendly with Timothy (John Leyton), a medical student, and Sarah (Jennifer Hilary), Timothy's girl friend. Timothy is dominated by his wealthy and beautiful mother, Carol (Jennifer Jones), who is divorcing her husband. There is an Oedipal undercurrent between mother and son, and Timothy is not happy that Carol plans to marry again. Nevertheless, as Carol continues to control his life, Timothy wishes to be more independent. Marco finds a studio apartment, and Timothy pays the first two months' rent, planning to move in with his friend and switch from medicine to art. An angry Carol prevents the move, and Sarah, who has fallen in love with Marco, moves in instead. During a party at her weekend cottage, Carol becomes furious when she finds Marco and Sarah kissing in Timothy's room, and she orders Marco from the house. Later, Timothy is involved in a pub brawl, and Marco defends him and brings him home unconscious. Carol is appreciative, and warms to him. Later at a bar, Marco and Carol dance, and it is clear the repressed Carol is attracted to him. Timothy looks on, uneasily. On New Year's Eve, Marco arrives at Carol's house to accompany Timothy to a party. But Timothy had already left, and Marco is left alone with Carol. He seduces her, then scorns her in retaliation for his earlier humiliation at the cottage. He leaves for the party which is on a boat, and arrives drunk accompanied by a streetwalker. He hints broadly to Sarah of his conquest of Carol, which Timothy overhears. Anguished, Timothy runs up on deck and Marco stumbles after him. Timothy violently thrusts him away, but a woozy Marco falls into the water and drowns, despite Timothy's efforts to save him. Questioned by the police, Timothy refuses to reveal the cause of the fight. Thus, without his admitting to the actual provocation, it is determined that Marco drowned at Timothy's instigation. Carol, who has arrived during the questioning, reaches out to Timothy as he is being led away by the police, but he coldly turns away.

CMC is headquartered in London, with hubs in Sydney and Singapore. It is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index. History1989-2000: Early years= The company was founded in 1989 by Peter Cruddas as a Foreign Exchange market maker under the name Currency Management Corporation. The name was later abbreviated to CMC and then changed to CMC Markets in September 2005. In 1992, CMC Markets became authorised and regulated in the UK by the AFBD which later became the Financial Services Authority (FSA). In 1996, the company launched a real-time FX trading platform and has made claims to have done the first FX deal on-line over the internet. Although not verifiable, CMC Markets was certainly one of the first companies to offer on-line trading over the internet. The company pioneered internet trading technology with its MarketMaker software platform. From 1996 to 2000 Information Internet Limited, as well as supplying CMC Markets, sold the software to a small number of banks. In 2000 Peter Cruddas bought out the other owners, made the software exclusive to CMC Markets and the remaining parts of Information Internet Limited became the internal IT function of CMC Markets. = 2000: Introduction of CFDs and Financial Spread Betting = In 2000, CMC Markets began to offer contracts for difference (CFDs) and the following year it introduced online spread betting on financial markets. These two products would become the bulk of the business for CMC Markets. =2000-2006: Global expansion= In 2002 the company began embarking on a major global expansion drive. It expanded quickly between 2002 and 2007 and opened offices in a large number of countries, as well as growing the spread betting business in the UK and the CFD business internationally. This began with its first overseas office in Sydney, Australia headed by Goran Drapac and David Trew. The first North American office was opened in 2003 in New York headed by Josh Levy. This was followed by the acquisition of Canadian broker Shorcan Index, which became its Toronto office in 2005 headed by Simon Grayson. From 2001-2005, CMC Markets also operated the brand name deal4free.com. This brand was designed to promote the zero commission charge service, used primarily for its UK-based spread betting business. Commissions were later re-introduced and this brand was dropped as part of the re-branding in September 2005. In 2006, the company planned to become a public company via an initial public offering; however, the IPO was cancelled at the last minute due to market conditions. =2007: M&A; activity= In 2007, CMC Markets acquired financial media and technology company Digital Look which ran the financial information site Digitallook.com and sold financial data to third party sites. The company was merged into CMC Markets' main operations in London, but continued to run the website and data services for third parties. Subsequently, CMC Markets bought the Australian stock broker, Andrew West. This was merged with the CMC Markets Australian operation and renamed CMC Markets StockBroking. It continued to offer physical share broking services in Australia. Later in 2007, Goldman Sachs bought a 10% stake in the company for ¬£140m, effectively valuing the company at ¬£1.4bn. =2008-2013: Global financial crisis= In 2008 and 2009, CMC Markets saw profits decline with the global financial crisis. In response, Peter Cruddas changed his management team and closed seven offices and reduced the company headcount from a high of 1,100 employees. In 2010, CMC Markets launched its Next Generation trading platform to the UK market. The new trading software improved on previous MarketMaker software; amongst other things being able to quote market prices to additional decimal points and provide trade execution without re-quotes. In 2011 the Digital Look business unit was sold to Spanish-based Web Financial Group. =2014-present= After a return to profits in 2014, speculation emerged that CMC Markets was again looking at an IPO. In July 2015, CMC Markets started to offer binary options and launched a particular binary option product known as a Countdown. On 5 February 2016, CMC Markets was first listed on the main market of the London Stock Exchange at 240p equating to an initial market capitalisation of ¬£691 million. On 25 April 2016, CMC Markets launched a range of binary products specifically designed for mobile, tablet and desktop. On 2 June 2016, it was confirmed that from 20 June 2016, CMC Markets would be included as a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index. On 15 November 2016, CMC Markets was awarded \\"Best CFD Broker\\" at the Finance Magnates London Summit. On 25 September 2018, CMC Markets issued a profit warning which was followed, on 21 November 2018, by an announcement that CMC Markets had suffered a 76% drop in profits. In April 2019, CMC Markets announced that its CFO & COO, Grant Foley, would leave the business after the shares hit a record low following a fresh profit warning; one analyst observed that the company was now \\"a loss-making business\\". Operations CMC Markets is one of the companies that launched CFD products to the retail market in 2000 and is one of the major CFD providers. No reliable data exists for the over-the-counter CFD and spread betting industry. However, in 2009 some industry participants commissioned a survey to look at the UK market and results indicated that CMC Markets' market share in 2008 was lower than its main competitor.

She was built in 1973 by W√§rtsil√§ Helsinki Shipyard, Finland as Royal Viking Sky for Nordenfjeldske Dampskibsselskap, Trondheim, which placed the ship in Royal Viking Line service. Concept and construction Royal Viking Sky was ordered by Nordenfjeldske Dampskibsselskap, Trondheim from the W√§rtsil√§ Hietalahti shipyard in Helsinki, Finland. She was one of three near-identical ships ordered by different companies for Royal Viking Line service. Her sister ships were Royal Viking Star, owned by Bergenske Dampskibsselskap, Bergen, and Royal Viking Sea, owned by A. F. Klaveness & Co, Oslo. The Royal Viking Sky was launched from drydock on 25 May 1972 and delivered to her owners on 5 June 1973. Service history Following delivery to Royal Viking, Royal Viking Sky was used for luxury cruises around the world. In 1982 she was lengthened from to at the A.G. Weser shipyard in Bremerhaven, West Germany. In 1984 Kloster Cruise acquired the entirety of Royal Viking Line. Subsequently, in 1991 Royal Viking Sky was transferred to the fleet of Norwegian Cruise Line (also owned by Kloster) under the name Sunward. In 1992 Sunward was sold to Birka Cruise, who renamed the ship Birka Queen for Baltic Sea cruising. Her career with Birka only lasted for the 1992 northern hemisphere summer season, and in late 1992 was chartered back to NCL, reverting to the name Sunward. In 1993 the ship was chartered to Princess Cruises, becoming Golden Princess. Following delivery of newer tonnage to Princess Cruises, the company terminated the charter of Golden Princess. Subsequently, Birka Cruises sold the ship to Star Cruises, who renamed her SuperStar Capricorn. In 1998 SuperStar Capricorn was chartered by Star Cruises to Hyundai Merchant Marine, who renamed the ship Hyundai Keumgang for cruises from South Korea to North Korea. Hyundai's cruise operations failed in 2001, and Hyundai Keumgang was returned to Star Cruises and resumed service under the name SuperStar Capricorn. In 2004 the ship was sold to Iberocruceros, who renamed her Grand Latino for Mediterranean cruising out of Spain. In 2005 the ship was sold to Fred. Olsen Cruise Lines and renamed Boudicca. Following changing of her main engines at the Blohm + Voss shipyard in Hamburg, Germany, the ship entered service with Fred. Olsen in February 2006. In March 2010, the ship was relocated to its new base in Liverpool, England, where it has replaced , which was also owned by Fred. Olsen Cruise Lines. On 25 January 2015, the ship carrying more than 1,000 people was left without power off Morocco after an engine room fire. The fire at 04:00 BST left the ship \\"listing\\" and \\"in pitch black\\", said Dave Tonkin, whose father was on board. Fred Olsen, the company which owned the ship, said it was fully stable and had five engines running again. In March 2018, Boudicca underwent significant renovation at the Blohm + Voss shipyard in Hamburg, Germany. In October 2019, Boudicca became the first passenger ship to dock at new facilities at Walvis Bay, Namibia after a decade of re- development. Two tugboats from the Namibian Port Authority celebrated the occasion by firing water cannons and officials handed out gifts to visiting passengers. On 21 August 2020, Fred. Olsen announced that the Black Watch and her sister ship Boudicca were sold as accommodation ships at Tuzla, Istanbul Shipyard workers.

The railway is double track, standard gauge and fully electrified at 3 kV DC. It connects the cities of Settimo Torinese, Chivasso, Santhi√†, Vercelli, Novara, Magenta and Rho. Since February 2006 high-speed trains have operated over the Turin‚ÄìMilan high-speed line between Turin and Novara. The remainder of the high-speed line between Novara and Milan was opened in December 2009, when the Bologna‚ÄìFlorence high-speed line and the remaining sections of the Rome‚ÄìNaples high-speed railway line and the Naples‚ÄìSalerno high-speed line are opened, completing the high-speed network between Turin and Salerno. HistoryConstruction and opening= The line was built by Thomas Brassey under contract to the Societ√† Vittorio Emanuele (\\"Victor Emmanuel Company\\", named in honour of Victor Emmanuel II, then king of Piedmont and Sardinia) and opened between Turin and Novara on 20 October 1856 and extended to the Ticino river‚Äîwhich formed the boundary between Piedmont and the Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia (then part of the Austrian Empire)‚Äîon 18 October 1858. The bridge over the river connecting to the existing railway from Milan at Magenta was opened on 1 June 1859. Three days later the French-Sardinian army led by Napoleon III defeated the Austrians at the Battle of Magenta with the help of supplies brought by the new railway. This was a major step in the unification of Italy. The line formed part of the Societ√† per le strade ferrate dell'Alta Italia (Upper Italian Railways) from 1865 and the Societ√† per le Strade Ferrate del Mediterraneo (Mediterranean Railway Company) from 1885. = In the twentieth century = An intercity at Ponzana Following the nationalisation of the railways, the line was incorporated into the state network and its operation was taken over by Ferrovie dello Stato between 1905 and 1906. The line was severely damaged during the Second World War. In 1951, it was restored to operation, albeit temporarily, in some parts. The main line from Novara to Rho was electrified from the timetable change in May 1960. The missing section from Turin to Novara was electrified the following year and inaugurated on 4 June in the presence of the Minister of Transport Giuseppe Spataro, on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the unification of Italy. At the beginning of the 2000s, the management of the line passed to Rete Ferroviaria Italiana.  Features  The line is double-track, electrified at 3,000 volts DC and standard-gauge with a length of . Its infrastructure manager, RFI classifies it as a \\"fundamental line\\". The line has five junction stations, Settimo, Chivasso, Santhi√†, Vercelli and Novara. Lines branch off as follows: from Settimo to Pont Canavese; from Chivasso to Ivrea/Aosta, Asti and Alessandria; from Santhi√† to Arona and Biella; from Vercelli to Casale and Pavia; and from Novara to Biella, Alessandria/Arona, Domodossola and Varallo Sesia. The railway line is paralleled by the Turin‚ÄìMilan high-speed railway, which crosses it several times during its journey, with connections at several points, including at: Torino Stura, Settimo, Bianz√®, Novara and Rho Fiera. Trains can reach a top speed of 160 km/h on most of the line and between Magenta and Pregnana Milanese the speed limit is 180 km/h.  Operations The line is used by freight and passenger trains of various categories, which are operated by various companies. Trenitalia operates the following services each day: * twenty pairs of fast regional trains between Turin and Milan; * regional trains on the Novara/Vercelli‚ÄìChivasso‚ÄìTurin/Ivrea route; * a pair of InterCity services between Turin and Milan; * two pairs of InterCity Night services between Turin and Reggio Calabria. In addition six TGV services a day are operated on the Milan‚ÄìTurin‚ÄìParis route; The Novara‚ÄìMilan section is also used by line S6 of the Milan suburban railway service, operated by Trenord, while the Chivasso‚ÄìTurin section is used by line 2 of the Turin metropolitan railway service, operated by Trenitalia.

Cruikshank. Background The violence followed conflict in the state over the disputed 1872 gubernatorial election, when differing parties concluded that the Democrat John McEnery or the Republican William Pitt Kellogg had won. While reviews were pending, each candidate certified slates of local officers, increasing social tensions in many areas. It was months before Grant weighed in on behalf of Kellogg. The real issues were the continuing struggle for power between conservative white Democrats and freedmen and other Republicans. Grant Parish was one of several in northwest Louisiana newly established in 1869 during Reconstruction. It had a black majority and took in both plantations and upland timber areas. Most of the freedmen were former slaves on local plantations. Social tensions were high; as a result of the disputed election, the competing governors each certified lists of local Republican and Democratic officials. Republicans reclaimed local offices which they had won. Freedmen, including members of the state militia, gathered in Colfax at the parish courthouse to defend Republican officials from Democratic takeover. During days of rising tensions, rumors ran wild on both sides. Black families gathered at the courthouse after a man was killed in an outer area. At the same time, whites became alarmed and formed a militia made up of veterans from Grant, Winn and nearby parishes. On Easter Sunday, white militia attacked the Colfax courthouse held by freedmen; in the end, they killed more than 80 freedmen, 50 of them that evening, after they had surrendered and been taken prisoner. Lane's approach Lane describes the events leading up to the massacre, but he especially focuses on the political repercussions of prosecution of members of the white militia for the deaths of the freedmen. The U.S. Attorney in New Orleans James R. Beckwith struggled to achieve justice for those who had been slain. Two trials resulted in a case that was appealed to the Supreme Court, United States v. Cruikshank (1876). Lane focuses on James R. Beckwith and his persistence with a case so controversial that his life and career were threatened. The Court ruled against the plaintiffs, saying that actions by individuals were not covered by constitutional protections, and they should seek relief in state courts. During and for many decades after Reconstruction, white men were seldom prosecuted and almost never convicted for murders of blacks.

History Available records, writings, books reveal that at first there was no such place known as Daspalla. Rather it was a part of Boudh State ruled by Bhanj Kings. During the rule of Bira Bhanj there was a rift in between Bira Bhanj and his cousin, Sal Bhanj. The dissident Sal Banj left Boudh and proceeded to meet the Gajapati of Puri through the ages old Jagannath Sadak. While resting with his followers at Padmlatola Forest, the king of Nayagarh got the news and made alliance with Sal Bhanj and declared him the king of that area. Getting the news, Bir Bhanj of Boudh got angry and sent a troop to capture Sal Bhanj. But the troop of Boudh got defeated at the hands of Sal Bhanj and Nayagarh soldiers. As Sal Bhanj got Yasha (Fame), he named his kingdom as Yashpalla or Daspalla. Other historians tell that king Sal Bhanj had only das (oriya for 10) Pallies (villages) so Daspalli got renamed as Daspalla. This incident took place in 1495. King Sal Bhanj ruled for 3 years only and then his son Naran Bhanj ascended the throne. But records found at Boudh state reveal that Daspalla was formed by Naran Bhanj in 1498 during the reign of Siddya Bhanj. However, it is a fact that Daspalla was formed during the last part of 15th century being separated from Baudh. The headquarters of Daspalla changed from Badmul to Gania, Gania to Madhyakhand, Madhyakhand to Puruna Daspalla. The ninth king of Daspalla Padmanav Bhanj, during hunting, saw a wonderful thing that a wild dove was hunting and defeating a Chhanchan (Bird of prey). So, he thought the place a heroic one and decided to change his capital to that place. At that time there was a Kandha chieftain named Kunj Malik. King Padmanav Bhanj defeated Kunj Malik and started his capital here but after the name of Kunja Malik the capital got named as Kunjabanagarh.History Retrieved 9 October 2017.

One of its members described it as an organization for \\"social sororities functioning in the field of education.\\" Its former members include current NPC members Sigma Sigma Sigma, Alpha Sigma Alpha, and Alpha Sigma Tau, as well as now-defunct sororities Delta Sigma Epsilon, Pi Kappa Sigma, Theta Sigma Upsilon, and Pi Delta Theta.  History  On July 10, 1915, Sigma Sigma Sigma and Alpha Sigma Alpha held a preliminary conference in Cinninati and then on September 4, 1915 in Boston formed a \\"panhellenic in education\\" between themselves, first called the Association of Pedagogical Sororities. These two sororities created the Association in order \\"to give the student in training for the teaching profession the same opportunities of sorority affiliation which the liberal arts students and those in other professions enjoyed,\\" in response to a 1911 survey which found national sororities operated at almost all campuses except those of teaching schools.ASA Phoenix Vol 2, No 8, November 1915 Invitations were granted to Pi Kappa Sigma and Delta Sigma Epsilon in 1917. At the third national convention, the four sororities changed the name from Association of Pedagogical Sororities to Association of Education Sororities. Per the official meeting minutes, the name change was to \\"establish definitely professional standing in Hellas\\". In 1920, Sarah Ida Shaw Martin, a founder and former national president of Delta Delta Delta and the current president of Alpha Sigma Alpha, petitioned the National Panhellenic Conference for membership on behalf of the AES. However, this request was rejected on the basis that women could not hold dual membership in two NPC organizations (as Shaw Martin would if the education sororities were accepted). Three other sororities were admitted to AES membership through the next few decades: Theta Sigma Upsilon (1925), Alpha Sigma Tau (1926), and Pi Delta Theta (1931). In 1941, Pi Delta Theta merged with Delta Sigma Epsilon. By 1938, membership was restricted to groups on campuses that offered four-year education programs. The AES had local units on campus and in larger cities and held biennial conferences regularly from 1917 through 1947. = Joining the National Panhellenic Conference = From 1915 through 1926, National Panhellenic Conference (NPC) and AES sororities operated chapters in the same colleges and universities. In 1926, the NPC and AES made an agreement \\"defining fields of activities of each panhellenic\\". There was competition between NPC and AES sororities, and dual memberships were often held. By the 1940s, however, many teacher's colleges had begun to add liberal arts programs, and vice versa, which led to difficulties in functioning separately as they had had in the past. On November 12, 1947, at a conference in Colorado Springs, Colorado, the NPC considered and granted associate membership \\"with reservations\\" to the six AES sororities. The AES was holding its biennial meeting when it was notified of the NPC decision and, at that meeting, \\"completed the necessary business and took formal action to dissolve the Association of Education Sororities\\". The merger had various aftereffects, especially for alumnae. Dual memberships in NPC sororities were not allowed, so women who belong to two sororities had to choose between their NPC or former AES sorority. After the merger, AES alumnae were also allowed to join City Panhellenic Associations, an action that went in effect on June 1, 1948. Chapters themselves also experienced changes. The NPC required former AES sororities to close chapters at colleges without regional accreditation. Former AES members continued previous functions in terms of finances and programs but were encouraged to have larger memberships for the next fall rush. On June 1, 1948, the six former member organizations of AES were granted NPC associate membership and full membership in 1951. Since that time, three AES members have merged with other NPC groups, leaving Alpha Sigma Alpha, Alpha Sigma Tau, and Sigma Sigma Sigma as the remaining former AES members. Once functioning as sororities exclusively for teacher's/educational colleges, the former AES members, as social sororities, now admit members without limits based on major.  Programs  The Association implemented programs and financial structures keeping its members, young teaching students, in mind. The individual sororities developed a scale of fees in respect to their own members' limited incomes, as well as participating in activities such as \\"student loan funds, establishment of hospital beds, local social service projects... [and] the endowment of a rural school library\\". By 1944, the Association had a Scholarship Award Committee which awarded fifty dollars each year to an undergraduate student at a teaching college. Shortly before its merger with the NPC, the AES was part of a larger multi-panhellenic association, the Council of Affiliated Panhellenics, with the NPC and the Professional Panhellenic Association. The AES focused not only on educational (providing scholarships) and women-centric issues but also cooperated to support issues outside of the sorority world including defense projects during World War II. One of the projects started by the AES member groups resulted in what is today the world-renowned Leader Dogs for the Blind School in Rochester, Michigan. = Publications = Social Precedents and Sorority Ethics (1935) was a small guide written by three members of AES sororities.

The synthesis of phytoene is the first committed step in the synthesis of carotenoids in plants. Phytoene is produced from two molecules of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) by the action of the enzyme phytoene synthase.Phytoene synthase The two GGPP molecules are condensed together followed by removal of diphosphate and proton shift leading to the formation of phytoene. Dietary phytoene and phytofluene are found in a number of human tissues including the liver, lung, breast, prostate, colon, and skin.Khachik F, Carvalho L, Bernstein PS, Muir GJ, Zhao DY, Katz NB. Chemistry, distribution, and metabolism of tomato carotenoids and their impact on human health. Experimental biology and medicine. 2002;227:845-51. Accumulation of these carotenoids in the skin may protect the skin by several mechanisms: acting as UV absorbers, as antioxidants, and as anti-inflammatory agents.  Structure  Phytoene is a symmetric molecule containing three conjugated double bonds. Phytoene has a UV-Vis absorption spectrum typical for a triply conjugated system with its main absorption maximum in the UVB range at 286 nm and with Œµ1% of 915.  Sources  Analysis of several fruits and vegetables showed that phytoene and phytofluene are found in majority of fruits and vegetables. In contrast to all other carotenoids, phytoene and phytofluene, the first carotenoid precursors in the biosynthetic pathway of other carotenoids, absorb light in the UV range. History The structure of phytoene was established and proven by total synthesis, by the Basil Weedon group in 1966. References 7\\\\. Book chapter: Liki von Oppen-Bezalel, Aviv Shaish.

Gallaudet is the first school of higher education to be devoted to the education of the deaf and hard of hearing. Its campus was planned by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux, and its Gothic buildings were designed by Frederick Withers. The main Gallaudet College building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1966 and designated a National Historic Landmark in 1965. The landmarked area was increased to cover the southern part of the campus, and was renamed as a historic district in 1974. Description and history An early school for the deaf was founded in 1857 by Amos Kendall, and was located on 8th Street NE. Edward Gallaudet, a superintendent of that school, envisioned a larger federally chartered institution, and in 1864 founded the Columbia Institution for the Deaf and Dumb, which was renamed in honor of his father in 1894. The master plan for the school's Washington campus was developed by the Olmsted, Vaux & Co. in 1866, and its first three buildings were designed by Vaux & Withers. Most of the master plan was carried out by 1878; a significant portion of that area has retained historic integrity and looks much as it did at its completion. The main exception is areas to the north and east, where the college (later university) has expanded. The historic district covers about of the Gallaudet campus, which is now about in size. It is roughly L-shaped, bounded on the south by Florida Avenue and the east by Fowler and Kendall Halls. From Kendall Hall the boundary runs west, between Edward Miner Gallaudet and College Hall, north to the Old Gymnasium, and then west and south to include Professor's Row. The district includes Chapel Hall, a major example of Collegiate Gothic architecture and the President's House, an elaborate example of High Victorian Gothic design, both designed by Frederick Withers as part of the original master plan.

Frequency of preauricular sinus differs depending the population: 0.1‚Äì0.9% in the US, 0.9% in the UK, and 4‚Äì10% in Asia and parts of Africa. Preauricular sinuses are inherited features, and most often appear unilaterally. They are present bilaterally in 25‚Äì50% of cases. Presentation Complications = Occasionally a preauricular sinus or cyst can become infected. Most preauricular sinuses are asymptomatic, and remain untreated unless they become infected too often. Preauricular sinuses can be excised surgically, but often present a high risk of recurrence.  Causes  Preauricular sinuses and cysts result from developmental defects of the first and second pharyngeal arches. This and other ear malformations are sometimes associated with renal anomalies. In rare circumstances these pits may be seen in genetic conditions such as branchio-oto-renal syndrome; however these conditions are always concurrent with other health concerns.  Treatment  Courses of treatment typically include the following: * Draining the pus occasionally as it can build up a strong odor * Antibiotics when infection occurs. * Surgical excision is indicated with recurrent fistular infections, preferably after significant healing of the infection. In case of a persistent infection, infection drainage is performed during the excision operation. The operation is generally performed by an appropriately trained specialist surgeon e.g. an otolaryngologist or a specialist General Surgeon. * The fistula can be excised as a cosmetic operation even though no infection appeared. The procedure is considered an elective operation in the absence of any associated complications.

Within CIM, the product is considered a subset in what meets the customer's need of identification, problem solving, and consumption. The possibility to influence the design and the consumption itself is assumed to be of great importance for the customers buying decision and loyalty. One example of a company that uses CIM is Nike.

The group has seen a number of upheavals both internal and external during its history. On average, the group has held a performance every fortnight since its creation. It started as a group of young men and women, primarily students, that was concerned with the military oppression of arts and cultural activities in Pakistan. The group cherished a society that has gender equity and democratic values, respects all humans and offers equal economic opportunities to all. Rahs believes in organized and conscious efforts to realize this dream. Theater is its medium. Rahs‚Äô experience in the art of theater is very deep as well. From staging classical epics to quick response street skits and from working out foreign adaptations to improvising ones with community and from performing at overseas festivals to villages and urban slums, Rahs has touched upon a host of issues. Rahs‚Äô canvas is very wide and diverse as it has dealt with subjects like child marriage and women's right to marry of their free will and staged plays against arms race and military dictatorship. Besides experimentation and experience, Rahs has learned theater from its gurus like Badal Sarkar. Its members have received training from many institutions in other countries. The group has imparted theater training to a number of civil society organizations as well. It has supported scores of other organizations by performing for the communities with which they work. Rahs draws inspiration from Punjab's indigenous theater tradition. Its name ‚ÄòRahs‚Äô is the Punjabi word for local form of theater and its logo shows the basic props of this theater. The group aims to marry the tradition with modern techniques and concepts and make it an effective tool in the hands of organizations working for social change. Rahs performs plays only in the mother language of its audience ‚Äì the people of Punjab. The group believes that the mother language lies at the heart of the issue of cultural identity. The group not only performs but also trains other dramatic societies and community organizations to do theater as an art and use it as an effective tool of communication.

History  On September 26, 1876 in the district town of Belgorod, the Teacher's Training Institute ‚Äì the ninth of that kind in Russia ‚Äì was founded by the order of the Russian Ministry of Public Education. On June 4, 1919 Belgorod Teacher's Training Institute was reorganized into Belgorod Pedagogical Institute by the order of the People's Commissariat for Education of the RSFSR, and in 1920 it was reorganized into Belgorod Institute of Public Education. In 1922 Belgorod Institute of Public Education was reorganized into Belgorod Practical Institute of Public Education, which was reordered into the Pedagogical Secondary School in September, 1923. In 1939 it became the Teacher's Training Institute again. The university had to temporarily suspend its operation in 1941 due to the outbreak of World War II and resumed its work only when the area had been completely liberated from fascists ‚Äì in 1944, but in a new place ‚Äì the town of Stary Oskol (Belgorod region) because Belgorod came out of war almost totally destroyed. Since 1957, the university has been located in Belgorod. Nowadays the university has several campuses in and out of the city. In the early 2000s, the university complex began to develop and expand fast due to new buildings with modern equipment. The number of students over the last 7 years has grown more than three times.  University Today  * 23 thousand students from all regions of Russia; * More than 2500 foreign students from 80 countries; * 18 Joint Educational Projects with top universities of Europe, Asia-Pacific Region; * 3 Bachelor's and master's degree programs in English; * Over 160 agreements for international cooperation; * 14 Associates and Members of Russian Academy of Sciences; * Over 1112 Doctors and Candidates of Science; * 7 Institutes, 3 Faculties, Medical College, 1 branch; * Cooperational agreements for internship with more than 800 enterprises; * 19 core subdepartments and 103 sub-departments; In 2009, Belgorod State University was selected along with other 27 finalists of the national competition of higher education institutions development programs to be awarded the category of national research university. In 2009, the university became the base institution of The Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) Network University, in the priority areas of Nanotechnology, Regional Studies and Ecology. On April 26, 2010, following the secret voting, the Contest Committee of the Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation selected the universities to be awarded the title of national research university. It was the second round involving the best of the best ‚Äì 32 Russian universities out of 128 university-applicants. Only 15 out of those 32 universities became the winners, Belgorod State being one of them. Over five years the university received 2 billion rubles of federal funding, which allowed the university to complete the projects within some research programs, to build a new dormitory for 1,000 residents and an 80-apartment house for young scientists. In 2012, BelSU joined the rank of the 30 best national universities, following a study of 103 Russian state universities and 500 branches. As of the end of 2013, all the major indicators of another stage of the National Research University Program were reached, by which the university proved its national research university status and effectiveness. In 2012 and 2014, BelSU won in the competitions of development programs for students‚Äô associations. Successful implementation of the programs along with the federal financial support amounting to about 55 million rubles encouraged the development of the BelSU Students‚Äô Union and helped the student self-government to move to a new high-quality level in various fields of the university's life. Belgorod State University consists of several campuses. The central campus includes 8 academic buildings, a research library, a publishing house, a museum of BelSU history, a university newspaper editorial office, a Career Counseling Center, Youth Cultural Center, a dormitory, an apartment block for university faculty, St. Gabriel's University Church and an administrative building. This campus provides facilities for professional training of future lawyers, philologists, translators, biologists, chemists, doctors, pharmacists, journalists, geologists, geographers, managers, economists, and programmers. All the buildings of the central campus were built at the beginning of the 20th century. The campus of the Faculty of Theology and Social Sciences is located in the renovated building of the former His Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh's men's classical school. The building is an original monument of eclectic architecture and is under protection of the state. The apartment block for faculty, put in operation in 2010, is located nearby. Yet another university campus houses classrooms, research laboratories, Distance Learning Center, 5 dormitories, Burevestnik (shearwater) Sport Complex, Center of Preclinical and Clinical study, and BelSU Clinic. Academic facilities on this campus are mostly used by future school teachers of Russian and Foreign languages, Physics and Mathematics, History, Primary school and Fine arts, Physical culture, as well as speech therapists and psychologists.  Research centres and laboratories  Today BelSU is home to 23,000 students from all regions of Russia and 80 countries of the world.

Agent-based social simulation is a scientific discipline concerned with simulation of social phenomena, using computer-based multiagent models. In these simulations, persons or group of persons are represented by agents. MABSS is a combination of social science, multiagent simulation and computer simulation. ABSS models the different elements of the social systems using artificial agents, (varying on scale) and placing them in a computer simulated society to observe the behaviors of the agents. From this data it is possible to learn about the reactions of the artificial agents and translate them into the results of non-artificial agents and simulations. Three main fields in ABSS are agent-based computing, social science, and computer simulation. Agent-based computing is the design of the model and agents, while the computer simulation is the part of the simulation of the agents in the model and the outcomes. The social science is a mixture of sciences and social part of the model. It is where social phenomena are developed and theorized. The main purpose of ABSS is to provide models and tools for agent-based simulation of social phenomena. With ABSS, one can explore different outcomes of phenomena where it may not be possible to view the outcome in real life. It can provide us valuable information on society and the outcomes of social events or phenomena.  Principles of multiagent-based social simulation  Multi-agent system  A multi-agent system is a system created from multiple autonomous elements interacting and reacting on each other. These are called Agents. See Agent-based model. In simulation, Agents can be used to simulate many different elements. These could be society, organism, machine, person or any other active element, which does, or does not exist in real world. In a multi-agent system, an agent is represented by a software program or algorithm. This program contains in itself all rules of agents behavior. The purpose of models could be simulation of social phenomena like transportation, market failures, cooperation and escalation and spreading of conflicts. Agents in concept of ABSS In Agent based social systems, agents Emergence in context of social simulation In agent based simulations we can observe phenomenon, when model based on simple rules results in very complex dynamics. This phenomenon is related to emergence and one of recent topic of social science is concept of emerging behavior in social science (Kontopoulos, 1993; Archer, 1995; Sawyer, 2001).  History  Sugarscape = The first widely known multi-agent generative social model was developed in 1996 by Joshua M. Epstein and Robert Axtell.EPSTEIN J M & Axtell R L (1996) The purpose of this model was simulation and research of social phenomena like seasonal migration, environmental pollution, procreation, combat, disease spreading and cultural features. Their model is based on the work of economist Thomas Schelling, presented in paper \\"Models of Segregation\\" Thomas Schelling. This model represented the first generation of computer-based social simulations. Epstein and Axtell‚Äôs model was implemented using concepts from the \\"Game of Life\\" developed by John Horton Conway.  Usage for social sciences  There are three main objects of scientific implementation of ABSS (Gilbert, Trotzsch; 2005) = Understanding basic aspects of social phenomena = Like aspects involving its diffusion, dynamics or results. Such a basic models should be based on simple rules, so way in which resulting behavior emerges from system could be easily observable. = Prediction = These models are implemented to prediction real life events and phenomena. Examples of use could be transportation (prediction of traffic in future to find places where traffic jams could occur), prediction of future unemployment rates etc. Problem of models made to accurately predict such an events is increasing complexity of model with number of dynamically changing parameters. = Research, testing and formulation of hypothesis = Unlike other two main objects, which have use outside Social sciences, latter one is used mainly on the field of social science. Agent-based social simulations are often used during research of new hypothesis. Simulation could be useful when there is no other way to observe agents during their actions. For example, during creation of new language, which is long-term process. Another benefit of simulation lies in fact, that to be able to prove theory in simulation, it has to be represented in formal and logical form. This leads to more coherent formulation of theory.  Multi- Agent Simulation Suites (MASS) usage for problem solving  Society and culture  Models of information diffusion in social environment = An academic article investigates an agent-based simulation of information diffusion in Facebook online social network. = Organizing networks  Emergence of social phenomena = Altruism and cooperation Ethnocentrism = Crowd behaviour = Models for natural disasters (evacuation ‚Äì fire) = Economical science  Business = Market behavior models = Religion = Software used for implementing ABSS  SeSAm running an agent-based model Different agent based software have been used for implementing ABSS such as * #k@ (HASHKAT) Online social network (e.g. Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn) simulator, describes realtime dynamics, message passing, and user behavior.

Its mission is to reduce the burden of malaria in disease-endemic countries by discovering, developing and facilitating delivery of new, effective and affordable antimalarial drugs. Its vision is a world in which these innovative medicines will cure and protect the vulnerable and under-served populations at risk of malaria, and help to ultimately eradicate this terrible disease. History MMV was launched in 1999, with initial seed finance of US$4 million from the Government of Switzerland, Department for International Development (UK), the Government of the Netherlands, The World Bank, and Rockefeller Foundation. In 1999, the pipeline for new antimalarial drugs was virtually empty. The possibility of profit in antimalarial drug development was considered too low to attract pharmaceutical investment. Malaria was killing 1-2 million people a year, most of them children under five and pregnant women from the poorest regions of the world. The drugs they were using no longer worked and the need to act in the face of a projected public health disaster due to escalating drug resistance provided reason to launch MMV and has since proved that the public-private partnership model is an efficient way to bridge the gap in new drugs for malaria. Organization and governance MMV is governed by a Board of Directors chosen for their scientific, medical and public health expertise in malaria and related fields, their research and management competence as well as their experience in business, finance and fundraising. The Chairman of MMV's Board is Per Wold- Olsen. MMV also has a Board of Directors in North America, an Expert Scientific Advisory Committee which helps to identify projects, an Access & Product Management Advisory Committee and a Global Safety Board which reviews projects. Project portfolio MMV's project portfolio focuses on delivering efficacious medicines that are affordable, accessible, and appropriate for use in malaria endemic areas. Specifically, the goal is to develop products that will provide: efficacy against drug-resistant strains of Plasmodium falciparum, potential for intermittent treatments (infants and pregnancy), safety in small children (less than 6 months old), safety in pregnancy, efficacy against Plasmodium vivax (including radical cure), efficacy against severe malaria, and transmission-blocking treatment. Access and delivery MMV works in partnership to ensure the life-saving antimalarials emerging from its research-and-development pipeline do not suffer undue delays in reaching patients in need. MMV's access team focuses on assuring acceptance of new medicines, expanding reach to vulnerable patients and measuring and evaluating impact and need. Open source research MMV started the Open Source Malaria project, which encourages those interested to share procedures and results of open source research. The Open Source Malaria project received worldwide media attention after helping, together with researchers at the University of Sydney, to supervise high school students at Sydney Grammar School who adapted a synthesis of Daraprim (pyrimethamine), using a less hazardous method to improve safety, to illustrate the ability of enthusiastic amateurs to produce this drug. Daraprim has been marketed in the U.S. at $750 per pill due to non- patent exclusivity restrictions; the students synthesized it for under $20 USD.

The Tongass people pressed suit for damages, to the tune of $20,000, and were supported by a grand jury in Alaska which indicted twelve of the Seattle party for theft of government property (as the village was attached to Fort Tongass, then revived as a minor military base during the Klondike Gold Rush and associated boundary dispute). The case was eventually shunted aside, partly due to intervention by state representatives and senators from the all the Pacific Coast states, and while the Post- Intelligencer did offer $500 compensation, these funds never reached Tongass village or the Raven clan. The pole was burned by an arsonist on October 22, 1934. A new, replica, pole was commissioned and was created by carvers at Saxman, Alaska and shipped south on , and was erected at the same location on July 25, 1940, and stands at Pioneer Square to this day.Adapted from LitSite Alaska website, The Stolen Totem Pole, article by Tricia Brown Climate The extreme rainfall at Tongass was noted in a report concerning for the Canadian Pacific Railway in 1880, with the mean annual precipitation having been recorded by that point as being 118.3 inches a year, with 200 days a year being either rainy or snowy.Report and Documents in Reference to the Canadian Pacific Railway By Canada, Dept. of Railways and Canals, Sandford Fleming Published by Printed by Maclean, Roger & Co., 1880, 373 pages, p. 108 Demographics Fort Tongass appeared on the 1890 U.S. Census as an unincorporated village of 50 residents. 43 were Tlingit Natives, 6 were White and 1 was of \\"Mixed\\" race (White & Native ancestry).http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/1890a_v8-01.pdf See also * Fort Stikine * Tongass National Forest External links * Totem posts, Ft.

Early life  Born in a bourgeois Protestant family, this brilliant student of philosophy was very soon fascinated by cinema. Through a cousin, he started working for the newsreel program √âclair Journal and in 1934 set up his own production company with Ren√© Zuber, \\"Les Films du Compas,\\" later known as, \\"Roger Leenhardt Films.‚Äù  Career  As a critic in the journal Esprit, he was considered one of the most perceptive observers of pre- war France and strongly influenced Andr√© Bazin and the entire \\"Nouvelle Vague.‚Äù Thanks to his series of articles known as \\"La petite √©cole du spectateur,\\" cinema became considered as an art and a language in its own right. Leenhardt also contributed to other journals, such as Fontaine, Les Lettres Fran√ßaises, and l'Ecran fran√ßais, in which in 1948 he delivered his famous cry, \\"Down with Ford! Long Live Wyler!\\" In 1949, he fostered the creation of the cinema club Objectif 49 of which he was the co-president with Robert Bresson and Jean Cocteau. Destined to promote a new cinema d'auteur, the club resulted in the creation in Biarritz of the Festival of Cursed Films [Festival des Films Maudits]. Beginning in the 1950s he presided over the French Association for the Promotion of Cinema [Association fran√ßaise pour la diffusion du cin√©ma] which organized a traveling festival, Cin√©ma Days [Les Journ√©es du cin√©ma] (1953‚Äì1960). Finally, in 1955 Leenhardt participated in the creation in Tours of the International Days of Film [Journ√©es internationales du film] which became the Festival of Tours. Specialized in short films, the festival brought together the foremost filmmakers, including Fran√ßois Truffaut, Chris Marker, Agn√®s Varda, Jacques Demy, Roman Polanski, Robert Enrico, and others. His documentary works are numerous and include the creation of more than 60 short films and the production of a similar number. There are two main categories of his work: Portraits of great writers (e.g. Fran√ßois Mauriac, Paul Val√©ry, Victor Hugo, etc.), and portraits of famous painters (e.g., Monet, Pissarro, Bazile, etc.). He also made a film on the origins of photography (Daguerre ou la Naissance de la photographie, 1964) and another on the invention of cinema (Naissance du cin√©ma, 1946), a masterpiece of pedagogical and intelligence. Privileging his artist vision, Leenhardt made only three feature-length fiction films: ' (1948), ' (1961), and, for television, Une fille dans la montagne (1964). Moreover, Roger Leenhardt appeared in three films as an actor. In Les Derni√®res vacances, he is the teacher. Jean-Luc Godard chose him to be the character \\"Intelligence\\" in Une femme mari√©e (1964) and Fran√ßois Truffaut chose him as the publisher in L'Homme qui aimait les femmes (1977).

The park has been designed to provide greenery to Petronas Twin Towers and the areas surrounding it. Design The park was designed by Roberto Burle Marx. It is said that it was the last work undertaken by the Brazilian architect. When the park was designed, the aim was to \\"leave the world a little more sensitive and a little more educated to the importance of nature\\". The park was designed to showcase a heritage of tropical greenery by integrating man's creation with nature. The park itself contrasts as a calm environment in the midst of the hustle and bustle of the city. The park features many combinations of man-made design such as cements, water features and also natural features such as trees, shrubs, stones and wood. Elements of shape and topography were created to give an illusion of space. The combination of trees, shrubs and sculptures were arranged to provide color and form to the park. Conservation and bio-diversity was a major influence in the creation of the park. 23 of the mature and rarer specimens were saved from the old Selangor Turf Club and transplanted into the park grounds. 1900 indigenous trees and 66 species of palms were planted in the park to promote bio-diversity. The trees were deliberately selected to attract local and migratory birds. A man made lake was built in the middle of the park with a 18 meter high water fountain, directly in front of Suria KLCC mall and Petronas Twin Towers towards the middle of the park. A 4.3 meter elevated bridge that cut across the lake provides a vantage view of the park and the twin towers.

It lies on Latitude: 0¬∞ -29' 0 N, Longitude: 37¬∞ 43' 0 E and is about 90 miles North East of Nairobi. Kanyuambora is one of the eight locations that form Siakago constituency. It was formerly part of the now defunct Mbeere District. Etymology Loosely translated, the name Kanyuambora means \\"one who drinks honey\\". The area is named after Kanyuambora hill, which is a conspicuous landmark in the region. The name most probably emanated from an age-old practice by the Ambeere people. During the pre-colonial days, elders would gather at the foot of Kanyuambora hill to drink home-made traditional brew which, in essence, was a concoction of honey and water. During this spree, they would give thanks and pray to their gods. They would also discuss important community matters, laying strategies as well as cursing any neighboring tribes planning to attack the Ambeere. This is Kanyuambora Town, Embu County, Kenya in 2016. The photo was taken by BMJ Muriithi Kanyuambora is famed for being a pioneer in education in the region. This is perhaps true because it is one of the first places to be visited by Christian Missionaries when they first set foot on the general Embu region. It has arguably produced some of the most educated people in the region. This is epitomized by the fact that three out of the five national Legislative members from the larger Siakago Constituency, formerly known as Embu East, have come from Kanyuambora. They are the current speaker of Kenya National Assembly, Justin Bedan Muturi as well as former MPs Silvester Mate and Lenny Kivuti Maxwell. Other notables from Kanyuambora include United States based Kenyan journalist, Ben Mutua Jonathan Muriithi, popularly known as BMJ Muriithi. Mr Maguu Mutie, a former administrative Chief who headed the then Evurore Location once famously said, \\"were it not for the fact that Kanyuambora's physical location is not as Central as Siakago, the Divisional headquarters, read District Headquarters, would have moved there a long time ago\\". Kanyuambora's quest for education got a big boost when, in 2010, the Archbishop of Canterbury, who is the head of the Anglican Church announced from England that the Church had settled on Kanyuambora as the site for its first ever Higher education institution in the region. Consequently, the head of the Anglican Church in Kenya, Archbishop Eliud Webukhala, laid the foundation stone, signalling the beginning of the construction of the first ever Kenya Anglican University (KAU) in the country. Historic origin Like most other Kenya Bantus, the Mbeere ethnic group is believed to have initially come from Central Africa during the 15th Century Bantu migration. At first, they settled in the regions around Nyambene hills, north of Mt. Kenya. The Aembu and the Ambeere used to be one people. Their descendants moved from the Nyambene hills area, travelling in the South West direction to settle in the Runyenjes area of what was later Embu district. A legend says that Mwene-Ndega, the first Embu ancestor lived with his wife Nthara in a grove near the present day Runyenjes town. From here, his descendants spread out and occupied other parts of what was later Embu district. The Mbeere split from the Embu after an inter-clan war which the Embu clan won. After the victory, the Embu pushed the Mbeere to the drier and less fertile Kiangombe hills south of the Embu region. Despite this split, the two tribes co-existed peacefully. The Embu tribe often assisted the numerically smaller Mbeere tribe in times of drought, or when attacked by other tribes like the Akamba or Maasai. It was as a result of this alienation that a Kanyuambora came to be, thanks to the people who settled at the foot of Kanyuambora hill. Climate This is Kanyuambora Town, Embu County, Kenya in 2016. The photo was taken by BMJ Muriithi Compared to the rest of the region - notably the drier Ishiara in the South - Kanyuambora has a fairly moderate climate, which makes it favourable for growing of Mango trees which virtually saturate the area. Climatewise, it is considered the 'bridge' between the more fertile Embu region in the North and the semi arid section of Mbeere region in the South. Other crops include maize, millet, sorghum, beans, cassava, and yams. They also rear small herds of domestic livestock. Parts of the former Mbeere District are known to experience drought and subsequent lack of food quite often. The Mbeere therefore often rely on their Embu cousins for food supplies especially in times of drought. Kanyuambora people get their water from the nearby Thuchi river, which serves as the Eastern border between the Mbeere and the Chuka people. Other notable rivers include Rwiria and Ciaivuro both of which feed the bigger Thuchi river. Religion Like the Agikuyu and their cousins the Aembu, Kanyuamborans believed that their god, Ngai, lived on the top of Mount Kenya. Prayers and sacrifices were therefore traditionally made to this God. Today, most Kanyuambora people, indeed most Ambeere people are predominantly Christian. On 20 June 2011, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr. Rowan Williams, visited Kanyuambora to attend a groundbreaking and the dedication of a site for the building of the proposed Kenya Anglican University (KAU), the first such University in Kenya. The Ambeere People Little is documented about the Mbeere People. Mr H.S. Mwaniki Kabeca, a renowned Kenyan Historian, seemed to dwell more on the History of the Embu People in his published work. This is probably because during the time he wrote the books, Mbeere was itself part of Embu. Elsewhere, most accounts indicate that the origins of the Mbeere were the same as those of the Bantu- speaking Kikuyu, Embu, Chuka and Meru peoples, namely that their ancestors moved eastwards from central Africa some time before the sixteenth century, and had settled in the Nyambene Hills. From there, say the same sources, the people moved slowly southwards into the foothills of Mount Kenya, where they settled and gradually acquired their present-day tribal identities. Some Mbeere elders however believe quite the contrary, stating that some, if not all, of the Mbeere's ancestors came from the east, from the direction of Mombasa on the coast. All four Mbeere elders interviewed by H.S. Kabeca Mwaniki were unanimous that the Mbeere and Embu were once one people. This is strongly indicated by Mbeere oral history, which also includes the Embu ancestor Kembu (often referred to as 'Muembu'). The twist, though, is that his mother - whom the Aembu called Nthara - was called Cianthiga, and was herself the daughter of someone called Mumbeere, or Mbeere. This would indicate that the two tribes are not only related, but that the Mbeere could in fact be considered ancestors of the Embu. This would perhaps explain their close, mutual and amiable ties, which have persisted to the present day. Notable Kanyuambora personalities On March 28, 2013, Justin Bedan Njoka Muturi (popularly known as JB Muturi), a Mumbeere from Kanyuambora, was elected the first speaker of the national assembly of the Republic of Kenya under the new constitution which was promulgated in 2010. Mr Muturi was first elected to Parliament in 1999 on a Kanu ticket, a party he actively supported and engaged in its activities. Kivuti Maxwell, a Mumbeere from Kanyuambora, was elected the first ever Senator of Embu county on 4 March 2013. Other notables from Kanyuambora include United States based Kenyan journalist, Ben Mutua Jonathan Muriithi, popularly known as BMJ Muriithi, as well as the speaker of Embu County Assembly Justus Kariuki Mate. Former Embu East member of parliament, Sylvester Mate, also hails from Kanyuambora as does former Principal of Nairobi School, Joel Ngatiari.

Her work deals with the parallel themes of memory and loss.  Art  Grandmothers Long weekends Technically trained at Brown University, Providence, USA, Slade School of Fine Art, London, England and Central St Martins College of Art and Design, London, England her intricate ink drawings deal obsessively with the frontier between solitude and loneliness, comfort and disconsolation. The work was originally inspired by imagery from nightly drawings on post-it notes. Johnson's drawings have been described as \\"intimate both in content and nature. Exploring personal illness and anxieties, her work is much more than art therapy, but a delicate, illustrative analysis of vulnerability, fear and the looming dangers of life both physical and metaphorical.\\" Johnson's paintings are exhibited on unframed, stretched canvas, which, by avoiding the smug completeness of a frame, reminds the viewer that pictures miss as much as they reveal. On the subject of painting, she writes \\"I object to the belief that a painting should always be a statement about painting itself. If one has to extract such a statement from my paintings, it would be simply that paintings should relate to something significant about life, something worth spending that time on. They should be for anyone - for an unrestricted potential audience, rather than an elite group of experts.\\" She has won numerous awards for both her art and her writing, including the Michael S. Harper Poetry Prize in 2004. She has been published in Blithe House Quarterly and Cranky Literary Journal, for which she was briefly an assistant editor. Her artwork has been exhibited at Lauderdale House, the Jerwood Space and The Bargehouse Gallery in London. Johnson's 35 drawing piece, My Parents Told Me to Stay Calm, which formed part of the Deep Inspiration benefit for Asthma UK in 2007 received special mention by the organisers, including Gavin Turk. In 2009, exhibitions include the Oxford Contemporary at Ovada (7 February to 21 March 2009) and Will I Live Here When I Grow Up? a solo show at The North Wall Gallery, Oxford (11‚Äì29 May 2009). Johnson discussed how contemporary music has informed her writing in a talk for the University of Cambridge Festival of Ideas at Kettle's Yard, in November 2008.  Activism  Johnson has been a campaigner for gay, lesbian and transgender rights since high school and at university advocated for reform of the residence hall criteria, arguing that the current male/ female option was discriminatory and that insufficient attention was being given to issues like safe bathrooms for transgender students, who are often at high risk of assault in gender-specific zones. In 2009, Johnson taught a children's stories class for Tower Hamlets Council Children's Services as part of LGBT History month.http://www.lgbthistorymonth.org.uk/calendar/Documents/TH_lgbt-2009%5B1%5D.pdf References Category:Artists from Seattle Category:Writers from Seattle Category:Brown University alumni Category:Alumni of the Slade School of Fine Art Category:Alumni of Central Saint Martins Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Clare Johnson"},{"id":"21687636","text":"The Moricca family is a Calabrese family.

He subsequently became a journalist with the Central Press, then the Western Daily Press, and from 1963 with the Daily Express. At the Express, he was a political reporter, diplomatic correspondent and finally foreign editor, before becoming an assistant editor of the Daily Mail in 1972, and associate editor in 1974.

Steven left for the Daily Mail. In 1977, he took responsibility for the publication of a false story claiming that British Leyland had a fund to pay bribes. In 1982, he became editor of the Mail on Sunday, serving until 1992, when he became editor of the Evening Standard.

Targeting sick and elderly people through a combination of personalized letters and personal information databases, it has been shut down in the United States in 2016, but is still ongoing in many countries. History, scope and method Maria Carolina Gamba as Maria Duval, in 2008.The scam originates from a purported psychic of Italian origin named Maria Carolina Gamba, using \\"Maria Duval\\" as her trade name. Gamba gave psychic consultations in the South of France and attained some measure of notoriety. Gamba sold the rights to the psychic services of \\"Maria Duval\\" and entered into a contractual arrangement a group of people who used those to promote the sale of astrology charts, possibly in the early 1990s. The new copyright holders (or perhaps people who bought in a subsequent transaction) developed the scam as it would be known throughout the world: using information available publicly or through newspaper advertising at first, then purchasing personal information marketing databases, they would mail letters to potential victims, offering feats of divination by Maria Duval for $40. According to an investigation by CNN journalists Melanie Hicken and Ellis Blake, the scam was controlled for some time by two European companies, Astroforce and Infogest, both being owned by Ra√´lian Jean-Claude Reuille, who eventually sold his assets to undisclosed buyers. The group that now operates the Duval scam may be using the same model with other psychics. The scammers targeted aged or sick people, typically promising psychic help to improve their health or finances. The $40 fee applied to each piece of a correspondence that could stretch over years. More expensive forms of assistance such as plastic talismans and crystals were also offered, some victims paying thousands of dollars per year. The letters appeared to be hand-written and signed by Duval. They contained enough personal details to lead the victim to believe the person sending them might indeed have psychic powers. Even though at some point thousands of letters were generated per week, the scammers took great care to make them look as authentic as possible, with coffee stains or pages of (computer-generated) paragraphs giving the appearance of a personal letter. Some victims would develop feelings of friendship for the Duval persona, which increased the amount of correspondence. The name Patrick Gu√©rin would be used as Duval's psychic assistant, who also offered services, generating another revenue stream for the scam. Letters have been found in a dozen countries and generated revenues in excess of $200 million in the United States and Canada. The scam was managed by a series of successive groups using shell companies to hide their involvement. Gamba, however, continued to receive payments and did some promotional work under the name Maria Duval, even occasional news appearances at some point. Gamba's son thinks her mother agreed to be used as the face of the scam out of a desire to become rich and famous, then felt she was unable to stop the ongoing relationship. Early law enforcement investigations concluded Maria Duval may not actually exist, being a persona completely fabricated by scammers. That turned out to be incorrect when Ellis and Hicken, assisted by French colleagues, located Duval's residence in the south of France in 2016 and managed to interview her two years later. In August, 2018, they published \\"A Deal with the Devil: The Dark & Twisted True Story Of One Of The Biggest Cons In History\\", which narrates their search for the elusive Maria Duval/Carolina Gamba. Law enforcement investigations An investigation by the United States Department of Justice (DoJ) concluded in 2014 with some companies associated with the scam paying undisclosed amounts as out-of-court settlements. The DoJ also barred Hong Kong's Destiny Research Center and Montreal's Infogest Direct Marketing from sending letters to the United States (from Canada) and the criminal investigation targeting those two firms was still ongoing in 2018. Infogest flooded the United States with 56 million Maria Duval letters between 2006 and 2014 and has been investigated for other scams, including one about bogus weight loss products. Canadian financial services PacNet was subsequently accused of laundering money from the American Maria Duval operations, among other questionable clients. Investigators concluded the number of people scammed is considerable, including 1.4 million in the United States alone. Gamba's residence in Callas was searched by French police and American investigators in March, 2018. The United States Postal Inspection Service confirmed to CNN that a criminal investigation was under way as of July, 2018. In other media Paul Fidalgo from Center For Inquiry introduces 2018 Balles Award Winner A Deal with the Devil Investigative reporters from CNN, Blake Ellis and Melanie Hicken exposed the complex inner workings of a case of psychic fraud that spanned several decades and bilked over $200,000,000 from the mostly elderly victims. In 2019 the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry at CSICon awarded the Robert P. Balles prize for their work A Deal With the Devil. Wendy Grossman reviewing the book for Skeptical Inquirer Magazine concludes that skeptics should remember that sometimes the scammer can become the victim causing even more widespread damage. Grossman states \\"This is a twist we skeptics never saw coming: that those famous for their psychic claims could effectively sell their businesses to organized crime and become pawns of their new bosses\\".

It is modeled after the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). History and missionLegislative history= ARPA-E was initially conceived by a report by the National Academies entitled Rising Above the Gathering Storm: Energizing and Employing America for a Brighter Economic Future. The report described a need for the US to stimulate innovation and develop clean, affordable, and reliable energy.ARPA-E FY2010 Annual Report, http://arpa-e.energy.gov/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=JPgM-ETf-o0%3d&tabid;=438.

The initial budget of about $400 million was a part of the economic stimulus bill of February 2009. In early January 2011, the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 made additional changes to ARPA-E's structure; this structure is codified in Title 42, Chapter 149, Subchapter XVII, ¬ß 16538 of the United States Code. Among its main provisions, Section 16538 provides that ARPA-E shall achieve its goals through energy technology projects by doing the following: # Identifying and promoting revolutionary advances in fundamental and applied sciences; # Translating scientific discoveries and cutting-edge inventions into technological innovations; and # Accelerating transformational technological advances in areas that industry by itself is not likely to undertake because of technical and financial uncertainty. = Mission = Like DARPA does for military technology, ARPA-E is intended to fund high-risk, high-reward research involving government labs, private industry, and universities that might not otherwise be pursued. ARPA-E has four objectives: # To bring a freshness, excitement, and sense of mission to energy research that will attract the U.S.'s best and brightest minds; # To focus on creative, transformation energy research that the industry cannot, or will not support due to its high risk, but that has high reward potential; # To utilize an ARPA-like organization that is flat, nimble, and sparse, capable of sustaining for long periods of time those projects whose promise remains real, while phasing out programs that do not prove to be as promising as anticipated; and # To create a new tool to bridge the gap between basic energy research and development/industrial innovation. = Launch = ARPA-E was created as part of the America COMPETES act signed by President George W. Bush in August 2007. President Barack Obama announced the launch of ARPA-E on April 27, 2009 as part of an announcement about federal investment in research and development and science education. Soon after its launch, ARPA-E released its first Funding Opportunity Announcement, offering $151 million in total with individual awards ranging from $500,000 to $9 million. Applicants submitted eight-page \\"concept papers\\" that outlined the technical concept; some were invited to submit full applications. Arun Majumdar, former deputy director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, was appointed the first director of ARPA-E in September 2009, over six months after the organization was first funded. U.S. Secretary of Energy Steven Chu presided over the inaugural \\"ARPA-E Energy Innovation Summit\\" on March 1‚Äì3, 2010 in Washington, D.C..  Timeline  2006 The National Academies released ‚ÄúRising Above the Gathering Storm‚Äù report. August 9, 2007 President George W. Bush signed into law the America COMPETES Act that codified many of the recommendations in the National Academies report, thus creating ARPA-E. April 27, 2009 President Barack Obama allocated $400 million in funding to ARPA-E from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. September 18, 2009 President Barack Obama nominated Dr. Arun Majumdar as Director of ARPA-E. October 22, 2009 Senate confirmed Dr. Arun Majumdar as ARPA-E's first Director. October 26, 2009 Department of Energy awarded $151 million in Recovery Act funds for 37 energy research projects under ARPA-E's first Funding Opportunity Announcement. December 7, 2009 U.S. Secretary of Energy Steven Chu announced ARPA-E's second round of funding opportunities in the areas of ‚ÄúElectrofuels‚Äù, ‚ÄúInnovative Materials & Processes for Advanced Carbon Capture Technologies (IMPACCT),‚Äù and ‚ÄúBatteries for Electrical Energy Storage in Transportation (BEEST).‚Äù March 1 ‚Äì 3, 2010 ARPA-E hosted the inaugural ‚ÄúEnergy Innovation Summit‚Äù which attracted over 1,700 participants.

March 16, 2017 President Donald Trump's blueprint for the budget proposed to eliminate ARPA-E, stating it \\"provides small grants with limited measurable impacts and duplicates other Federal programs, such as Rural Utilities Service grants at the U.S. Department of Agriculture and formula grants to States from the Department of Transportation.\\" June 28, 2019 Lane Genatowski confirmed by Senate as Director of ARPA-E.https://www.aip.org/fyi/fyi-this-week/week-july-1-2019  ARPA-E and EERE  ARPA-E was created to fund energy technology projects that translate scientific discoveries and inventions into technological innovations, and accelerate technological advances in high-risk areas that industry is not likely to pursue independently. This goal is similar to the work of the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) which advances clean energy projects according to established roadmaps., However, ARPA-E also funds advanced technology in other spaces such as natural gas and grid technology.https://arpa-e.energy.gov/?q=arpa-e-programs/monitor https://arpa-e.energy.gov/?q=arpa-e-programs/move https://arpa-e.energy.gov/?q=arpa-e-programs/grid-dataARPA-E does not fund incremental improvements to existing technologies or roadmaps established by existing DOE programs.‚ÄúOne of ARPA-E‚Äôs strengths is its focus on funding high- risk, potentially transformative technologies and overlooked, ‚Äúoff-roadmap‚Äù opportunities pursued by neither private firms nor other funding agencies, including other programs and offices within DoE.‚Äù (NASEM report on ARPA-E, Finding 4-4). https://www.nap.edu/catalog/24778/an-assessment-of-arpa-e  Project creation and the review process  ARPA-E programs are created through a process of debate surrounding the technical/scientific merits and challenges of potential research areas. Programs must satisfy both ‚Äútechnology push‚Äù‚Äîthe technical merit of innovative platform technologies that can be applied to energy systems‚Äîand ‚Äúmarket pull‚Äù‚Äîthe potential market impact and cost- effectiveness of the technology. = Project creation = The program creation process begins with a ‚Äúdeep dive‚Äù where an energy problem is explored to identify potential topics for program development. ARPA-E Program Directors then hold technical workshops to gather input from experts in various disciplines about current and upcoming technologies. To date, ARPA-E has hosted or co-hosted 13 technical workshops. Following each workshop, the Program Director proposes a new program and defends the program against a set of criteria that justifies its creation. The Program Director then refines the program, incorporating feedback, and seeks approval from the Director. If successful, a new ARPA-E program is created, and a funding opportunity announcement (FOA) is released soliciting project proposals. = Peer review process = The ARPA-E peer review process is designed to help drive program success. During proposal review, ARPA-E solicits external feedback from leading experts in a particular field. ARPA-E reviewers evaluate applications over several weeks and then convene a review panel. One notable facet of ARPA-E's evaluation process is the opportunity for the applicant to read reviewers‚Äô comments and provide a rebuttal that the Agency reviews before making funding decisions. The applicant response period allows ARPA-E to avoid misunderstandings by asking clarifying questions that enable ARPA-E to make informed decisions.ARPA-E FY2010 Annual Report, http://arpa-e.energy.gov/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=JPgM-ETf-o0%3d&tabid;=438.  Funding and awards  First funding opportunity = The U.S. Department of Energy and ARPA-E awarded $151 million in American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds on October 26, 2009 for 37 energy research projects. It supported renewable energy technologies for solar cells, wind turbines, geothermal drilling, biofuels, and biomass energy crops. The grants also supported energy efficiency technologies, including power electronics and engine-generators for advanced vehicles, devices for waste heat recovery, smart glass and control systems for smart buildings, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), reverse-osmosis membranes for water desalination, catalysts to split water into hydrogen and oxygen, improved fuel cell membranes, and more energy- dense magnetic materials for electronic components. Six grants went to energy storage technologies, including an ultracapacitor, improved lithium-ion batteries, metal-air batteries that use ionic liquids, liquid sodium batteries, and liquid metal batteries. Other awards went to projects that conducted research and development on a bioreactor with potential to produce gasoline directly from sunlight and carbon dioxide, and crystal growth technology to lower the cost of light emitting diodes. = Second funding opportunity = The U.S. Secretary of Energy Steven Chu announced a second round of ARPA-E funding opportunities on December 7, 2009.ARPA-E Timeline, ARPA-E solicited projects that focused on three critical areas: Biofuels from Electricity (Electrofuels), Batteries for Electrical Energy Storage in Transportation (BEEST), and Innovative Materials and Processes for Advanced Carbon Capture Technologies (IMPACCT). On April 29, 2010, Vice President Biden announced the 37 awardees that ARPA-E had selected from over 540 initial concept papers.Vice President Biden Announces Recovery Act funding for 37 Transformation Energy Research Projects, The awards ranged from around $500,000 to $6 million and involved a variety of national laboratories, universities, and companies.ARPA-E Project Selections, April 29, 2010, http://arpa-e.energy.gov/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=mK6vhQztzb4%3d&tabid;=83 Unlike the First Funding Opportunity, the Second Funding Opportunity designated project submissions by category. Of the selected projects, 14 focused on IMPAACT, 13 focused on Electrofuels, and 10 focused on BEEST. For example, Harvard Medical School submitted a project under Electrofuels entitled \\"Engineering a Bacterial Reverse Fuel Cell,\\" which focuses on development of a bacterium that can convert carbon dioxide into gasoline. MIT received an award under BEEST for a proposal entitled \\"Semi-Solid Rechargeable Fuel Battery,\\" a concept for producing lighter, smaller, and cheaper vehicle batteries. IMPAACT projects included the GE Global Research Center's \\"CO2 Capture Process Using Phase-Changing Absorbents,\\" which focuses on a liquid that turns solid when exposed to carbon dioxide. = Third funding opportunity = On March 2, 2010, at the inaugural ARPA-E Energy Innovation Summit, U.S. Energy Secretary Steven Chu announced a third funding opportunity for ARPA-E projects. Like the second funding opportunity, ARPA-E solicited projects by category: Grid-Scale Rampable Intermittent Dispatchable Storage (GRIDS), Agile Delivery of Electrical Power Technology (ADEPT), and Building Energy Efficiency Through Innovative Thermodevices (BEET-IT). GRIDS welcomed projects that focused on widespread deployment of cost-effective grid-scale energy storage in two specific areas: 1) proof of concept storage component projects focused on validating new, over-the-horizon electrical energy storage concepts, and 2) advanced system prototypes that address critical shortcomings of existing grid-scale energy storage technologies. ADEPT focused on investing in materials for fundamental advances in soft magnetics, high voltage switches, and reliable, high-density charge storage in three categories: 1) fully integrated, chip-scale power converters for applications including, but not limited to, compact, efficient drivers for solid-state lighting, distributed micro-inverters for photovoltaics, and single-chip power supplies for computers, 2) kilowatt scale package integrated power converters by enabling applications such as low-cost, efficient inverters for grid-tied photovoltaics and variable speed motors, and 3) lightweight, solid-state, medium voltage energy conversion for high power applications such as solid- state electrical substations and wind turbine generators. BEET-IT solicited projects regarding energy efficient cooling technologies and air conditioners (AC) for buildings to save energy and reduce GHG emissions in the following areas: 1) cooling systems that use refrigerants with low global warming potential; 2) energy efficient air conditioning (AC) systems for warm and humid climates with an increased coefficient of performance (COP); and 3) vapor compression AC systems for hot climates for re-circulating air loads with an increased COP.DOE Announces $100 Million Available for Innovative Research, Secretary Chu announced the selection of 43 projects under GRIDS, ADEPT, and BEET-IT on July 12, 2010. The awards totaled $92 million and ranged from $400,000 to $5 million. The awards included 14 projects in ADEPT, 17 projects in BEET-IT, and 12 projects in GRIDS. Examples of awarded projects include a \\"Soluble Acid Lead Flow Battery\\" that pumps chemicals through a battery cell when electricity is needed (GRIDS), \\"Silicon Carbide Power Modules for Grid Scale Power Conversion\\" that uses advanced transistors to make the electrical grid more flexible and controllable (ADEPT), and an \\"Absorption-Osmosis Cooling Cycle,\\" a new air conditioning system that uses water as a refrigerant, rather than chemicals (BEET-IT).Department of Energy Awards $92 Million for Groundbreaking Research Projects, = Fourth funding opportunity = ARPA-E's fourth round of funding was announced on April 20, 2011 and awarded projects in five technology areas: Plants Engineered To Replace Oil (PETRO), High Energy Advanced Thermal Storage (HEATS), Rare Earth Alternatives in Critical Technologies (REACT), Green Electricity Network Integration (GENI), and Solar Agile Delivery of Electrical Power Technology (Solar ADEPT). PETRO focused on projects that had systems to create biofuels from domestic sources such as tobacco and pine trees for half their current cost. REACT funded early-stage technology alternatives that reduced or eliminated the dependence on rare earth materials by developing substitutes in two key areas: electric vehicle motors and wind generators. HEATS funded projects that promoted advancement in thermal energy storage technology. GENI focused on funding software and hardware that could reliably control the grid network. Solar ADEPT accepted projects that integrated power electronics into solar panels and solar farms to extract and deliver energy more efficiently. The Awardees for the fourth funding opportunity were announced on September 29, 2011. The 60 projects received $156 million from the ARPA-E Fiscal Year 2011 budget. Examples of the awarded projects included a project that increases the production of turpentine, a natural liquid biofuel (PETRO); a project entitled \\"Manganese-Based Permanent Magnet,\\" that reduces the cost of wind turbines and electric vehicles by developing a replacement for rare earth magnets based on an innovative composite using manganese materia (REACT); a project entitled \\"HybriSol,\\" that develops a heat battery to store energy from the sun (HEATS); a project that develops a new system that allows real-time, automated control over the transmission lines that make up the electric power grid (GENI); and a project that develops light-weight electronics to connect to photovoltaic solar panels to be installed on walls or rooftops.  ARPA-E Energy Innovation Summit  Since 2010, ARPA-E has hosted the Energy Innovation Summit. The 10th Summit was held July 8-10, 2019 in Denver, Colorado, and the 11th Summit will take place March 17‚Äì19, 2021 at the Gaylord Convention Center, near Washington, D.C.  ARPA-E Accomplishments  Arpa-E has generated 800 projects since inception, attracted about $2.9 billion in private investment for 145 of these projects, with $2 billion invested in R&D; by the US government. Published, peer reviewed research articles are also a significant output, totaling 2,489. In addition, the program has generated 346 patents. These numbers demonstrate that ARPA-E has succeeded in its primary purpose to fund high-risk, highly innovative energy technologies.

Wheeler (March 12, 1921 - August 26, 2013) was an American congressional relations expert, lobbyist, and member of the White House staff. After leaving the White House staff, he returned to Oklahoma, where he settled in Tulsa and became a lobbyist for Sun Oil Company. He retired from Sun in 1984 and returned to his ranch in his home town of Laverne, Oklahoma. He continued to do part-time work as a consultant for two Washington law firms until 1988. He died in Laverne in 2013. BiographyEarly life= Wheeler was born in Laverne, Oklahoma on March 12, 1921. His parents were Clyde A. Wheeler, Sr. and Lulu Rector Wheeler. After finishing high school, he attended American Business School in Wichita, Kansas, while working at several part- time jobs. His first full-time job was as office manager and clearance officer at the Wichita Municipal Airport. Entering the United States Navy in 1942, he served for the rest of World War II. After his discharge in 1946, he enrolled in Oklahoma State University‚ÄìStillwater (OSU), then known as Oklahoma Agricultural & Mechanical University, from which he received the B. A. degree in History and M. A. degree in Government. =Entry into politics= After working at a variety of jobs in Kansas and Oklahoma, following his graduation from OSU, he developed an interest in Republican politics, and was hired by the Oklahoma Republican State Central committee in 1950 to help manage the state‚Äôs Republican campaign of that year. A major result of the campaign was the election of Page Henry Belcher to the United States House of Representatives. Because of Wheeler‚Äôs work in the 1950 campaign, Belcher invited him to Washington, D.C., to organize his office staff. Wheeler spent three years as Belcher‚Äôs executive secretary. He handled Belcher‚Äôs public relations, and helped manage Belcher‚Äôs district and Washington, D.C. offices. Wheeler was also active in the Young Republicans and was elected vice chairman of the national organization in 1953. In February 1954, Ross Rizley, a Republican from Oklahoma who was serving as Assistant Secretary of Agriculture, invited Wheeler to the United States Department of Agriculture. Wheeler became Rizley‚Äôs confidential assistant and helped him manage Republican patronage in the department. In March 1955, Wheeler transferred to the office of Ezra Taft Benson, the United States Secretary of Agriculture, where he joined Benson‚Äôs congressional liaison staff. His success in working with members of Congress attracted the attention of Bryce Harlow who was a member of President Dwight D. Eisenhower‚Äôs congressional liaison staff at the White House. In February 1959, Harlow arranged to have Wheeler join the White House staff as a staff assistant to the President.Federal Records Division, National Archives and Records Administration. United States Government Organization Manual, 1959 ‚Äì 1960. Washington, D.C., Government Printing Office. 1959-1960. p. 59 Wheeler continued his congressional liaison work and specialized in legislation related to agriculture. As the Eisenhower administration neared its end, Wheeler, who wanted to return to Oklahoma, received a job offer from the Sunray Mid-Continent Oil Company (now Sunoco) of Tulsa, Oklahoma. However, a political opportunity arose which Wheeler was unable to resist. Oklahoma's 6th congressional district, which included his home town of Laverne, was represented by Toby Morris. In the 1960 campaign Morris was defeated for reelection in the primary by former congressman Victor Wickersham. Although the district was heavily Democratic, the bitter primary campaign left the Democrats badly split and it appeared likely that the Republicans could capture the seat. When the Republican candidate withdrew from the race in August, the party leadership in the district appealed to Wheeler to represent the party in the election. =Campaigning for office= After some initial hesitation, Wheeler accepted the challenge. He resigned from the White House staff at the end of August and returned to Oklahoma where he spent the next two months campaigning actively for the Congressional seat. When the election was held on November 8, Wheeler was found to have won by only 188 votes. Wickersham, however, refused to accept such a narrow defeat and demanded a recount. When the votes were counted a second time several tallying errors were found which shifted a number of votes to Wickersham‚Äôs favor. This was enough to give Wickersham the election. In mid-December Wickersham was declared the winner, much to the surprise of Wheeler, who had been assigned office space at the House of Representatives and was preparing for the move back to Washington. The opening at Sunray Oil was still available, so Wheeler settled instead at Tulsa and took up his new job in January 1961. As Public Affairs Representative at Sunray Oil, Wheeler‚Äôs main job was to follow state and national legislation which affected Sunray Oil and the oil industry. He also developed an educational program to encourage Sunray‚Äôs employees to participate in the political process. Outside of work Wheeler was active in community affairs. He taught Sunday school and supported Goodwill Industries and other charitable organizations in the Tulsa area. In December 1964 Governor Henry Bellmon appointed him to the Oklahoma State Board of Regents, which developed policy for the state‚Äôs colleges and universities. During 1968 and 1969, Sunray Oil merged with the Sun Oil Company of Pennsylvania. Wheeler was on the committee which helped combine the public affairs offices of the two companies. In 1970 the reorganized company, Sun Oil Incorporated, sent him to Washington, D.C., to take charge of its government relations office. As Vice President for Government Relations, Wheeler was basically a lobbyist who worked with Congress and officials of the Executive branch of government to develop legislation favorable to the oil industry. He helped channel contributions from Sun Oil‚Äôs Political Action Committee to Congressional candidates who were known to favor the oil industry. He also helped direct charitable contributions by the company to various cultural and educational organizations in the Washington, DC, area, such as the Center for Strategic and International Studies at Georgetown University, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial and Ford's Theatre. In April 1984 Wheeler retired from Sun Oil and returned to his ranch at Laverne, Oklahoma. He continued to work part- time as a legislative consultant to two Washington law firms until 1988. =Personal= Clyde met Barbara Ann Dodd in 1951, and the two married August 23, 1953 in Enid, Oklahoma. Barbara was born November 7, 1922. They had two daughters and a son. Barbara died on February 20, 2003. Clyde died on August 28, 2013. NotesReferencesExternal links * 1990 oral history with Clyde A.

The process, developed over the past 60 years by multiple research groups, enables the highly efficient conversion of coal, petroleum coke and biomass (e.g. switchgrass or wood waste) into clean, pipeline quality methane. Chemistry The chemistry of catalytic hydromethanation involves reacting steam and carbon to produce methane and carbon dioxide, according to the following reaction: 2C + 2H2O -> CH4 \\\\+ CO2 The process utilizes a specially designed reactor and depends upon a proprietary metal catalyst to promote chemical conversion at the low temperatures where the water gas shift reaction and methanation take place. When a feedstock treated with the catalyst is introduced into this reactor and mixed with steam, three reactions occur that efficiently convert the feedstock into methane. =Hydromethanation reactions= ;Steam carbon: C + H2O -> CO + H2 ;Water-gas shift: CO + H2O -> H2 \\\\+ CO2 ;Hydro-gasification: 2H2 \\\\+ C -> CH4 The combination of carbon (C) from the carbon feedstock, water (H2O) from steam, and the catalyst, produces pure methane and a pure stream of carbon dioxide (CO2) which is 100% captured in the system and available for sequestration. The overall reaction is thermally neutral, requiring no addition or removal of heat, making it highly efficient. The development of hydromethanation is an example of process intensification, where several operations are combined into a single step to improve overall efficiency, reduce maintenance and equipment requirements, and lower capital costs. Byproducts In addition to methane, hydromethanation produces a high-purity stream of carbon dioxide (CO2), an odorless, colorless greenhouse gas. This CO2 stream is fully captured in the process and can be prevented from entering the atmosphere using a process called sequestration. The CO2 can be injected into underground oil reserves, through a process called enhanced oil recovery (‚ÄúEOR‚Äù), or geologically sequestered. Because hydromethanation is a catalytic process that does not rely on the combustion of carbonaceous solids to capture their energy value, it does not produce the nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur oxides (SOx) and particulate emissions typically associated with the burning of carbon feedstocks, including certain types of biomass. Due to this quality, it intrinsically captures nearly all of the impurities found in coal and converts them into valuable chemical grade products. Ash, sulfur, nitrogen, and trace metals are all removed using commercial gas clean-up processes and are either safely disposed of or used as raw materials for other products such as sulfuric acid and fertilizer. Commercialization GreatPoint Energy, a company founded in 2005 by serial entrepreneur Andrew Perlman, is a forerunner in the development and commercialization of hydromethanation. The company has raised $150 million in venture capital from Dow, AES Corporation, Suncor Energy Inc., Peabody Energy, Advanced Technology Ventures (ATV), Draper Fisher Jurvetson, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Khosla Ventures and Citi Capital Advisors (CCA). In May, 2012 GreatPoint Energy and China Wanxiang Holdings closed a $1.25 billion investment and partnership agreement to finance and construct the first phase of a one trillion cubic feet per year coal to natural gas production facility in China. The deal between GreatPoint Energy and Wanxiang was the largest US venture capital investment in 2012.

Early history The first Science Festival programme in the city ran from 2002 ‚Äì 2007. In 2008 funding from One NorthEast was awarded for an additional three festivals (2009‚Äì2011). The festival is delivered in partnership with Centre for Life, Tyne and Wear Museums, Newcastle Science City, Newcastle University, Newcastle City Council and culture10 as part of NewcastleGateshead‚Äôs world- class programme of festivals and events. Relaunch In 2009, the festival was re-launched with a new brand identity and website. There were three key strands of the programme catering for three different audiences; families, adults and schools. It included two family weekend events (7/8 & 14/15 March) and a series of adult events (lectures/science fiction/performances) during the week, as well as activities specifically for schools. The highlight of the week was the first Maker Faire event in the UK, which was held at the Centre for Life and Discovery Museum on the 14 and 15 March. Although there was no overarching theme for 2009, some events integrated with the national agenda. For example, to celebrate Charles Darwin‚Äôs 200th birthday, the festival commissioned the Darwin Brewery in Sunderland to develop a commemorative beer called Natural Selection which was available throughout March. In 2010, ScienceFest saw the return of Maker Faire ‚Äì an event for DIY technology and craft, ScienceFest After Dark ‚Äì a series of late night, adult only events and events specially focussed on developing science literacy skills. Headline makers included the world‚Äôs fastest Rubik‚Äôs cube solving robot, Power Tool Drag Racing and the UK‚Äôs most advanced musical tesla coil.

Penguin Classics (1955) ch.13 Wilfrid founded a monastery at Selsey, a former royal estate given to him by King Aethelwealh at the entrance to Pagham Harbour (modern-day Church Norton). After Caedwalla conquered the South Saxons c. 685, the area became part of the Diocese of Wessex, with its seat in Winchester. However, the bishopric of Sussex was re-established in about 705, and Wilfrid's monastery was taken over as the episcopal seat.Mee, A History of Selsey, Phillimore (1988). p.13 A picture painted by Lambert Barnard, which hangs in Chichester Cathedral, represents the interview between Caedwalla and St Wilfrid. In the top left corner can be seen a representation of Selsey Church and the priory as it appeared in 1519.Heron-Allen. Selsey Historic and Prehistoric. Duckworth (1911).p. 109 It is probable that the bell tower, shown separate from the church on the Barnard painting, dated from the 11th century or earlier was constructed as some sort of fortification and not actually part of the church. A churchwarden's presentment from 1662 stated \\"That there was never any steeple belonging to the church (at Selsey), but a tower formerly belonging to a ruined castle, somewhat remote from the church where the bells hung...\\". An excavation of the mound in 1911 discovered the foundations of a square tower and the remains of a ringwork that would have supported the tower. It seems that the old tower lasted till 1602 when it blew down. A replacement tower was constructed, this time attached to the church, in 1662.F. G. Aldsworth.

In 1864‚Äì66 the church was dismantled stone by stone and re-erected in its present position where it was orientated North rather than East. The chancel remained at Church Norton and was dedicated to St Wilfrid in 1917 and is known as St Wilfrid's Chapel. A new Victorian chancel was added to the re- erected mediaeval nave.The new parish church, complete with a new chancel, was consecrated on 12 April 1866.\\"Heron-Allen.

The old rectory was sold off and renamed Norton Priory. Heron- Allen. The Parish Church of St Peter. p. 18. Building The church originally stood at Church Norton, until the 19th century when it was moved to the current centre of population. Under ecclesiastical law, the church can be removed but not the chancel. So the old chancel was left.Heron-Allen. The Parish Church of St Peter. pp. 6‚Äì7 The church consisted of two arcades of three bays each between the nave and the aisles, of the late 12th century; it had barely been finished when it was decided to lengthen the church by one bay westward. The old chancel (which still remains at Church Norton) was of slightly later date, early 13th century. The date when the tower was begun is unknown. A sacristy or flanking chapel on the north of the chancel had disappeared before the 19th century. The font c. 12th century The old chancel has clasping buttresses at each east corner, a small buttress (apparently modern) near the west end of the north wall, and buttresses (the remains of the east walls of the aisles) to north and south of the west wall.\\"Selsey, A History of the County of Sussex: Volume 4: The Rape of Chichester\\" (1953), pp. 205‚Äì210.

The new chancel added to the church, in its current position, is Victorian.Heron-Allen. The Parish Church of St Peter. pp. 10‚Äì11 The east window is of three trefoil- headed lights with Perpendicular tracery, perhaps late 14th century; the rear- arch may be that of a former lancet triplet. In the south wall are two pointed-headed niches with chamfered arrises, the eastern is now a credence, the western a piscina; though the style of these suggests a later date than the 13th century the original moulded string-course which runs round the south, east, and north sides of the chancel rises to clear them. Next are two 13th-century lancets with segmental rear-arches, and a priest's doorway with plain pointed exterior arch, 13th century but much repaired with cement, and segmental rear-arch; this is now blocked externally, and its recess serves as a cupboard. Next is a two-light window without tracery, the lights having semicircular heads, perhaps a 17th-century enlargement to light a reading- desk, the inner part of the splay and the rear-arch being those of a 13th- century lancet. In the north wall are two lancets like those in the south; perhaps a third, now blocked, exists west of them. On the outside of this wall there is a weather-mould where the roof of a building adjoined it on the north. The church has a chalice dating from Elizabethan times and also an ancient font. The architect Ian Nairn, dated the font as being constructed at around 1100.I. Nairn and N. Pevsner, The Buildings of England: Sussex. Harmondsworth 1965, pp. 319‚Äì20. However, this was seen as a little early by other historians. The font, which is made of Purbeck marble, Heron-Allen suggests was of a type that was very common in the south east counties in the 12th century, having shallow bodies with circular basins standing upon a square base and supported by a large central and small angle shafts.Heron- Allen. Selsey Historic and Prehistoric. Duckworth 1911.p. 185 Architect Philip Mainwaring Johnston was responsible for the reredos. The church is a Grade II listed building.

It now houses the Society of the Cincinnati's international headquarters and a research library on 17th and 18th century military and naval history and the art of war. It is also open to the public as a historic house museum about life in Washington in the early 20th century. History Ballroom at Anderson House Anderson House was built between 1902 and 1905 as the winter residence of Larz Anderson, an American diplomat, and his wife, Isabel Weld Perkins, an author and American Red Cross volunteer. Architects Arthur Little and Herbert W.C. Browne of Boston, Massachusetts, designed the home in the Beaux-Arts style. The Andersons used the house to entertain the social and political elite of America and abroad, as well as to showcase their collection of fine art and historic artifacts that the couple acquired in their extensive travels over the forty years of their marriage.Stephen T. Moskey, Larz and Isabel Anderson: Wealth and Celebrity in the Gilded Age, Bloomington, IN, 2016, pp. 113-124. The Andersons had no children. Following Larz Anderson's death in 1937, his widow donated the house and its contents to the Society of the Cincinnati, of which Larz Anderson had been a devoted member for more than forty years. The Society opened Anderson House as a museum in 1939. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971 and was further designated a National Historic Landmark in 1996. Today, Anderson House continues to serve its members and the public as a headquarters, museum, and library. Visitors to the museum at Anderson House can tour the first two floors of the house, decorated with the Andersons' collection and interpreted to illuminate the world of entertaining and collecting in Washington. Visitors can also view changing exhibitions devoted to the history of the American Revolution, the Society of the Cincinnati, and Anderson House and its occupants. In addition to the Andersons' original collection, the Society's museum collections include portraits, armaments, and personal artifacts of Revolutionary War soldiers; commemorative objects made to remember the war and its participants; objects associated with the history of the Society and its members, including Society of the Cincinnati china and insignia; portraits and personal artifacts of members of the Anderson family; and artifacts related to the history of the house, including the U.S. Navy's occupation of it during World War II. Anderson House has been featured on the A&E; television series, America's Castles, as well as C-SPAN.

Course and features The river rises in the Yorkey Range below Mount Romeo near , north-northwest of . The river flows generally in a north-westerly direction, joined by three minor tributaries that drain waters from the Trevethan Range before finally heading eastwards to Walker Bay. At its river mouth, the Annan River is joined by the Esk River and together the two rivers empty into the Coral Sea south of . The river descends over its course and flows through the Black Mountain (Kalkajaka) National Park and the Annan River (Yuku Baja-Muliku) National Park. The river has a catchment area of . Being in a wet-dry tropical climate the river receives the majority of its approximately rainfall per year between the months of December and April, a period known as the wet season. The river is crossed by the Mulligan Highway near Rossville and again closer to its mouth. Etymology The river was given its gazetted name by an early Australian pastoralist and magistrate, John Jardine, who, on 11 November 1865, named it after the River Annan in Scotland, while on passage in . History Much of Yuku Baja (i.e. its waterfalls, waterholes, and waters) hold locally indigenous names, inspire locally indigenous religious beliefs, and have been a primary source of life, sustenance, foods, and water for many thousands of generations of predecessors to the Kuku Nyungkal people (also known as the Annan River Tribe), for many thousands of years. Towards the end of the 19th century non-Aboriginal peoples had started to colonize the Far North Queensland region, and with the shift from predominantly gold mining activity (especially at Palmer River) to tin, lead, silver and copper mining, they started to move into the Annan River catchment and Kuku Nyungkal country. By 1885 Charles Ross had discovered tin in the upper Annan River area (firstly Mount Amos, then Mounts Hartley, Leswell and Romeo). Sluicing began that year, leading to a small-scale tin mining rush into Kuku Nyungkal country during 1886. Following this rush, for a number of years, a small but vibrant tin mining industry was able to mine lucrative tin deposits directly from underground lodes, creek beds and banks. Later, the industry had to adapt to exhausted supplies by consolidating and building water channels (races) through the Upper Annan River ranges to access higher, more difficult to reach deposits. One such -long race, known as the Annan River Company Water Race, was first built at the cost of an Adelaide based company in 1902 and is now cultural heritage listed and protected as Queensland heritage. The tin mining and other 'disturbance' history of the otherwise more pristine Annan River catchment can be briefly summarized as follows: > \\"This catchment has been quite extensively mined for tin since the late 19th > century. Some small alluvial tin mining leases may still ... contribute > significant sediment loads to the river. Other disturbances in the Annan > catchment include unsealed roads and fords, grazing, and a number of small > residential developments.\\"  Heritage listings  The heritage-listed Annan River Bridge, located on Development Road, Cooktown, is a rare example of a plate girder and screw pile bridge. It is also an uncommon example of a low-level bridge. Vegetation The Department of the Environment Natural Resource Atlas categorized the Annan River catchment as \\"Low Development\\", with less than 30% of its total catchment area being developed. The catchment as a whole has been described as being \\"...at the pristine end of the disturbance spectrum...\\", extensively forested as follows: > \\"...the southern and eastern portions [are] predominantly rainforest and > open eucalypt forest. The western and northern parts are more sparsely > vegetated consisting of open eucalypt forest and woodland with pockets of > rainforest along Oaky Creek.

On being informed of the Rising by phone, he ordered the brigade to Dublin by train. Arriving himself at Kingsbridge railway station in the early hours of Tuesday morning, Lowe assumed command of British forces in Dublin and set about securing the line between the station, Dublin Castle and Trinity College, thus dividing the rebel positions north and south of the river.

His highest post was munha pyeongjangsa (Î¨∏Ìïò ÌèâÏû•ÏÇ¨). This was the highest government position in the period. Song It was responsible for administration, judicial affairs and economy in the district. As he performed meritorious deeds during the King, he was conferred with Chanhwagongsin and Jincheonbaek. Baek was a position of politicians who were responsible for administration, judicial affairs and economy in the district. As the government created him Jincheonbaek, his family started regarding Jincheon as their origin. Hence, the family origin became Jincheon Song. When he was in the position of Sangsanbaek, he tried to be just and fair in all the administrative affairs and strived to enhance the welfare of his people. He also focused on education for the youth and courtesy for people, which made his district famous for most excellent behaviors in the nation. After that, the people have long paid tribute to his feats. During the insurrection of Yi Jagyeom in the 4th year of King Injong of Goryeo's reign in 1126, he was killed by a rebellious band led by Cheok Jun-gyeong while escorting the king. After the rebels were put down, Song It was posthumously named 'meritous subject' and titled Lord Sangsanbaek (ÏÉÅÏÇ∞Î∞±). Song was born in Durujinmaeul (village), Duchon-ri, Deoksan-myeon in 1125 during the reign of King Injong of the Goryeo Dynasty. He was promoted to Pyeonjangsa, which was the highest government position in the period. Tomb of Song In Chungcheongbuk-do Monument No. 91 Location: Duchon-ri, Deoksan-myeon, Jincheon-gun This is the tomb of Song In (?-1126). It has a rectangular-shaped protective wall surrounding the tomb, typical of the Goryeo style. There are two tombstones erected in the late Joseon Dynasty period. In the grave area, there are many tombs that belong to the clan. In front of his tomb stands the jaesil (chamber for memorial rites) with the tablet reading 'Sangsanjae'. His grave is in Duchon-ri, Deoksan-myeon, which had been called Duruji, Sanjeong- myeon. The beautiful peak behind his grave is called Mountain Bibong which was named after Bongsae (bird) that is said to live in heaven and to fly down to sit on the summit. However, after the statue was inscribed of In Gong, the founder of Jincheon Song, the peak was compared to a slowly dropped ume flower. Thus, Mountain Bibong was called Maesanbibong, in which 'Mae' was named after an ume flower instead of a bird. As he was a meritorious subject and served as a Pyeongjangsa (higher government official), the government ordered his grave mound to be surrounded by stones and a monument. The grave is one of the oldest ones in Jincheon and is recorded in Seokchong (stone tomb) in Hwanyeoseungram. Thousands of descendants of Jincheon Song are living across the nation. Song Guk-cheom and Song Eon-gi who were devoted to fight against the Mongolian invasion into Goryeo are also the offspring of Jincheonbaek.

The episode aired on March 23, 2009, and marks the return of writer Bryan Fuller. Plot The episode opens on Emile Danko shaving in his bathroom, when he is interrupted by his house alarm indicating the front door is open. Danko carefully investigates, noticing the open door, but also finds Eric Doyle, drugged and wrapped as a present with a gift note to Danko. Noah Bennet meets with Angela Petrelli in New York, who tells Noah to keep Danko from setting his sights on capturing her son Nathan Petrelli. Angela suggests he give Danko \\"Rebel\\" to distract him; though Noah points out that he may be of use to them, Angela remarks she is prepared to continue on without the aid of \\"Rebel.\\" Before leaving, Noah implies that Angela has now been targeted, though Angela replies she was planning on leaving the city. Later, Noah tells Danko that he can get Rebel for him. Having reviewed what he knows of Rebel's communications to Tracy Strauss, Noah believes that Rebel has a plan for her. He persuades Danko that they allow Rebel to break Tracy out so they can follow her to Rebel; a plan which Noah hopes will earn him Danko's trust and respect now that Nathan is no longer able to exert a moderating influence on the operation. Rebel does indeed break Tracy out by cutting the power to the heat lamps and unlocking doors for her. As she is escaping, she also frees Matt Parkman and Mohinder Suresh, who had also been pacified and hooked up to drugs. As they leave, Matt carries the wounded Daphne Millbrook with them. Afterwards, Matt and Mohinder take Daphne to a hospital. Daphne recovers from her wound and leaves, telling Matt that she cannot start a relationship based on a dream. Matt finds Daphne in Paris and reveals to her he can now fly. They fly together over Paris, admitting their feelings for each other. However, Daphne realises it is only fantasy, and that she is really still in the hospital. Daphne succumbs to her wounds and dies, with Matt in her head giving her a final, happy goodbye. Noah catches Tracy in a clothing store, revealing his plan of using her as bait to catch Rebel. However, he offers to let her go if she can lead his men to Rebel; Danko had wanted to kill both Tracy and Rebel once they were caught. Tracy eventually meets Rebel, who is revealed to be Micah Sanders. Tracy apologizes for what she has done, and Micah chastises her for it, though they are able to escape to a parking garage. Seeing agents closing in, Tracy tells Micah to use his ability to activate the fire- sprinkler system. Telling Micah to go on without her, Tracy uses her freezing ability to kill the agents and, in the process, sacrifice herself for Micah like Niki Sanders did at the end of Volume 2. Danko arrives and shoots the frozen Tracy, causing her to shatter into many pieces, while Noah laments over his failed plan to catch Rebel and Tracy's apparent death (although a piece of Tracy's face is shown, where her right eye is seen blinking away a tear). Hiro Nakamura and Ando Masahashi continue with the mission that Rebel entrusted to them, to keep the new hero safe. \\"Baby Matt Parkman\\" is discovered to be the child Matt had with his ex-wife, and to have the ability to deliver power with his touch (turning on a TV, activating electronic toys, etc.). Matt's ex-wife arrives, and they explain the situation. Before they can leave, Danko's men storm the house, and Hiro, Ando, and the baby seem trapped. However, the baby inadvertently helps Hiro regain his powers of time manipulation, and he is able to stop time. However, he finds he is still unable to teleport, and he takes the baby and the frozen-in-time Ando away from the house in a wheelbarrow. Far from the house, Hiro reverts time to normal, where he and Ando decide that with the baby, they will now be able to save the real Matt Parkman. Danko's men do come for Angela, though she is able to evade them having foreseen the event via her precognitive dreams. She then visits a friend of hers for cash to disappear. Finally, Danko's men seem to corner her in an elevator, as she had been trying to travel up the building, though the agents had changed the wiring to call the elevator down. However, Peter Petrelli arrives through the elevator shaft, and flies her to safety. The episode closes on a shot of Peter and Angela regrouping within the fitting irony of the Statue of Liberty, contemplating what to do next. Critical reception \\"Cold Snap\\" was met with overwhelmingly positive reviews with many considering it the best episode of the series' later run. Steve Heisler of The A.V.

Located southeast of the intersection of U.S. Route 60 and State Route 629 in Powhatan County, Virginia, with a street address of 2625 Old Tavern Road, it began as a small one-room house built by Benjamin Mosby in 1740, and remains a private residence today.NRHP listing. Mosby Tavern was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on April 11, 2003, and a monument was dedicated at the site on June 15, 2008.  History  Originally located in Goochland County, Mosby Tavern was in the western part of the county which became Cumberland County in 1749. From the county's formation until the formation of Powhatan County in 1777, Mosby Tavern served as the Cumberland County courthouse and jail,NRHP listing. \\"Benjamin \\"agreed to build a courthouse, prison, pillory, and stocks‚Ä¶at his own expense for the use of this county‚Ä¶and provide‚Ä¶convenience for holding courts at this place.\\"\\" as well as being a tavern and the private residence of the Mosby family.NRHP listing. \\"The tavern hosted nearly thirty years of court meetings for the Cumberland and later Powhatan courts...Cumberland court proceedings met at the Mosby residence until 1777 when it fell within the bounds of the new Powhatan County.\\" This, plus a popular racetrack across the road, made Mosby Tavern the center of the community.Ramage, p 13 During the American Revolution the tavern also served as a rendezvous for the county militia. For at least 100 years from its construction, Mosby Tavern was used as a private residence by the Mosby family, owned by: Benjamin Mosby, who purchased the land and constructed the original building in 1740; Colonel Littleberry Mosby Sr (also spelled \\"Littlebury\\") (17??-1809?); General Littleberry Mosby Jr (1757‚Äì1821), who was the third child, but the oldest living son at the time of his father's death, and who was so disappointed that many family members left the area that he made Littleberry III's inheritance conditional on the condition his return to Virginia; Edward Mosby, Littleberry Jr's younger brother, to whom Mosby Tavern passed when Littleberry III died in Tennessee without returning. The tavern was also used as the Powhatan County courthouse and jailNRHP listing. \\"Mosby Tavern is significant under Criterion A for it served Cumberland and later Powhatan Counties as a courthouse and prison while it was also an ordinary and private residence.\\" until 1779, when the county seat was moved to a newly constructed courthouse in Scottville.NRHP listing. \\"The Powhatan court convened at Mosby Tavern for two years before it moved to a courthouse in Scottsville.\\" After 1779 Mosby Tavern generally ceased to be used for public meetings, although the stature of the Mosby family in the area meant that even without official standing their home continued to play a major role in the social life of the area. Murder at Mosby Tavern On June 3, 1766, \\"pretty early in the morning,\\" Colonel John Chiswell (pronounced Chis-ell), a member of the Virginia House of Burgesses, got into an argument with Robert Routledge, a merchant from Prince Edward County, at Benjamin Mosby's Tavern. Both men were \\"much in liquor\\".\\"Virginia Gazette, July 4, 1776, p. 2\\" According to eyewitnesses, Colonel Chiswell, who was a Loyalist, called Routledge \\"a Presbyterian fellow, and a Scotish Rebel.\\"\\"Virginia Gazette, October 10, 1766, pg. 2\\" After these insults, Routledge, threw a glass of wine at Chiswell. At this challenge, Chiswell retaliated a threw a \\"bowl of Bumbo\\" at Routledge, followed by a candlestick and a pair fire tongs. Routledge then grabbed a chair intending to strike Chiswell with it. Chiswell then angrily called on his slave for his sword and demanded that Mr. Routledge leave the room. Joseph Carrington, the son-in-law of tavern owner Benjamin Mosby, took hold of Routledge and began to try and escort him out of the room when Routledge suddenly turned toward Chiswell and repeated the word \\"Fellow?\\" Chiswell stepped forward and thrust his sword at Routledge. Stabbed in the heart Routledge sank down in Carrington's arms dead.\\"Virginia Gazette, September 12, 1766, p. 2\\" The ensuing scandal intensified when Chiswell received special treatment. William Byrd, III, of Westover, was a justice of the General Court at Williamsburg and Chiswell's business partner in the lead mining operation. Byrd, along with fellow justices John Blair, Sr., and Presley Thornton permitted Chiswell to post a small bail of ¬£2,000. In the 18th century bail for the crime of murder was unheard of. The murder of Robert Routledge at the hands of John Chiswell unfolded following revelations that Chiswell's late son-in-law, John Robinson, Speaker of the House and Treasurer of Virginia, was the subject of a scandal regarding the misappropriation of public funds. Robinson had died a few months before in May 1766 and the subsequent investigation revealed that his estate owed the Colony of Virginia over ¬£1,000,000. On October 15, 1766, just before the start of his trial, John Chiswell was found dead on the floor of his home, the Chiswell-Bucktrout House in Williamsburg, Virginia. It is believed that he committed suicide on October 14th although the coroner stated that ‚Äúthe cause of his death ..., on oath, were nervous fits, owing to a constant uneasiness of mind,‚Äù. The Virginia Gazette published a detailed account of the murder which included a diagram of the crime scene. This document is thought to be the first crime scene diagram in America.\\"Virginia Gazette, July 18, 1766, p. 2\\"  Architecture  Mosby Tavern began as a small one-room house built by Benjamin Mosby in 1740.NRHP listing. \\"It has evolved from a small single-pile, one-room house built about 1740.\\" By the time Benjamin's grandson, Littleberry Mosby Jr, owned it in the early nineteenth century it was a one-story, hall-parlor plan frame dwelling shown on early nineteenth century insurance policies as 34' by 28'.NRHP listing. \\"Originally a one-story, single-pile, hall-parlor plan frame dwelling shown on early nineteenth century insurance policies as 34' by 28', Mosby Tavern is now a center hall-plan, two-story frame dwelling with nineteenth- century one-story wings.\\" According to tax records, the property value increased substantially in 1849 and 1859, and it is likely that most of the major additions were made during that time, expanding the house to a center hall-plan, two-story frame building with single-story wings. A two-story rear addition was constructed around 1950, and a rear porch was added in 1988, bringing the house to its present form.NRHP listing. \\"The Hatcher family added the two-story rear addition around 1950 and the present owners extended the east side of the addition and added the rear porch shortly after they purchased the property in 1988.\\" NotesReferences * * National Register of Historic Places, Mosby Tavern listing dated April 11, 2003. * * Category:Government buildings completed in 1740 Category:Buildings and structures in Powhatan County, Virginia Category:Hall and parlor houses Category:County courthouses in Virginia Category:Federal architecture in Virginia Category:Taverns in Virginia Category:Taverns in the American Revolution Category:Jails in Virginia Category:Drinking establishments on the National Register of Historic Places in Virginia Category:National Register of Historic Places in Powhatan County, Virginia Category:1740 establishments in Virginia ","title":"Mosby Tavern"},{"id":"21688161","text":"Jasen (; ) is a settlement immediately southeast of Ilirska Bistrica in the Inner Carniola region of Slovenia.Ilirska Bistrica municipal site Mass graves Jasen is the site of five known mass graves or unmarked graves from the Second World War.

In December 1941 he was appointed Commander of Submarines, Asiatic Fleet. In 1944 Wilkes was commander of all ports in Northern Europe. From 1945 to 1951 he was the chief U.S. Naval Officer in Occupied Germany. He retired in 1951. Biography Wilkes was born in Charlotte, North Carolina. He was the oldest son of John Francis and Anna Elizabeth Beale Wilkes. His grandfather, John Wilkes graduated in the first class of the Naval Academy in Annapolis. His grandfather, Admiral Charles Wilkes is best known for American Expedition to Antarctica and the Trent Affair. Wilkes entered the United States Naval Academy in June 1912 and, upon graduation in June 1916, was commissioned in the rank of ensign. For the next three years he served in the armored cruiser , including convoy escort duty in the North Atlantic during World War I. In 1919 Lieutenant Wilkes received submarine training and, during the next decade, served in several submarines, having command of and , and had shore duty as an Inspector of Machinery at Groton, Connecticut. In 1928-30 Lieutenant Commander Wilkes was assigned to the Portsmouth Navy Yard, Kittery, Maine, then spent three years as Commanding Officer of the submarine V-1, which was renamed in 1931. During 1933-35 Wilkes was attached to the Reserve Officers Training Unit at the University of California at Berkeley. He was Navigator of the heavy cruiser from mid-1935, receiving promotion to the rank of Commander during that time. Following a tour at the Mare Island Navy Yard, California, in June 1939 Wilkes took command of Submarine Division 15, in the Asiatic Fleet, and, from December 1939, also had command of Submarine Squadron 5. For six months after the Pacific War began in December 1941, Wilkes, who was soon promoted to Captain, commanded Asiatic Fleet submarines during their frustrating struggle against the fast-moving tide of Japanese conquest. On 29 December 1941 Wilkes and his headquarters staff were forced to evacuate from Corregidor Island in the submarine , and headed for Surabaya, Java. Following his return to the United States in mid-1942, Wilkes attended the Naval War College, then became Commanding Officer of the new light cruiser , taking her to the Mediterranean Sea to participate in the invasion of Sicily in July 1943. From August 1943 Rear Admiral Wilkes had amphibious force commands in England and France, playing an important role in preparations for the invasion of Normandy in June 1944, and the invasion of Southern France two months later. As the Allied ground offensive moved into Germany, Wilkes was in charge of U.S. Ports and Bases in France, materially assisting the offensive with his management of logistics. Rear Admiral Wilkes went to the Pacific in May 1945, as an administrator of amphibious forces as they worked towards the planned invasion of Japan. A few months after World War II ended, he returned to the U.S. to command the Atlantic Fleet's submarine force, a position he held from late December 1945 until March 1947. He then had duty with the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in Washington, D.C., before going to Europe to take command of Naval Forces, Germany, in August 1948. His final assignment was a brief tour as Commander Eastern Sea Frontier, beginning in March 1951. On the basis of a combat award Wilkes was advanced to the rank of Vice Admiral upon retirement in June 1951. Vice Admiral John Wilkes died at the Bethesda Naval Hospital, Maryland, on 20 July 1957.

The South American species C. peruvianus, the first archaeocete to be described on that continent, mainly differs from C. maxwelli in the number of cuspids in the lower premolars, but it also has the greatest numbers of thoracic vertebrae (20).

The PTJ was initially established within the Gendarmery of the Police and in April 2007 was made an independent unit within the Police Directorate of the Police. As its name states, the PTJ was oriented towards anti-terror operations as well as securing and maintaining the internal security of Serbia. Often only used in operations deemed too dangerous for other police units, it was highly trained and equipped. The PTJ's responsibilities included: resolving hostage situations, anti-terrorist operations, high-profile arrests and bomb disposal. Members of the PTJ operate with extreme professionalism and devotion to their responsibilities. This has earned the PTJ the great respect throughout the world as an elite special operations police unit among other such units. In 2016, the unit was disbanded and most of its members were incorporated into the Special Anti-Terrorist Unit (SAJ).

During World War II, Cerf played an active role in the Main-d'≈ìuvre immigr√©e groups under the aegis of the FTP-MOI resistance movement. In the post-war period, she co-founded the Commission centrale de l'enfance devoted to taking care of orphans from the Holocaust.  Biography  C√©cile Cerf was born in the city of Vilna. At that time in Russia, the city was renamed Wilno on passing to Polish hands, and became Vilnius after the Second World War. Vilna was a major Jewish cultural centre: traditionalism and modernism, mysticism and marxism, Zionism and anti-Zionism co-existed. It was in this effervescent intellectual and artistic climate that C√©cile Cerf performed her tumultuous studies. Elder daughter of Moshe Shalit, C√©cile Cerf spoke several languages, and at the age of 14, without fear of the violent repression, she joined the student revolutionary action against the Polish military dictatorship.Regards sur la litt√©rature yidich, √âditions Acad√©mie d'Histoire, 1974 In 1932, C√©cile Cerf pursued her schooling in Paris. After a brief time at the Lyc√©e Victor-Duruy, her political convictions drove her to abandon her studies in order to live an authentic working-class life. She married Marcel Cerf in 1934, became French, and opposed the rioters of 6 February 1934. During the Second World War, C√©cile Cerf's husband became a prisoner of war in Germany. C√©cile Cerf was on her own bringing up a young child, born at the start of the war. Nonetheless in 1942 she joined the resistance against the Nazi occupation. In December 1942, she joined the ranks of the Francs-tireurs et partisans (FTPF), a grouping which subsumed the French Forces of the Interior, in the Paris region. From 1942 until the liberation, C√©cile Cerf served the resistance continuously and doggedly, with growing and multiple responsibilities in French territory. At first she acted as a liaison agent. She participated in saving Jewish children, in finding lodging for the armed fighters of the FTPF, and in the supply of combat groups. She stood out particularly for her participation in the arms and supplies transports which allowed the realization of several operations, notably that of 17 January 1944 when a train carrying enemy troops was derailed near Bellay. From August 1943 until May 1944, C√©cile Cerf was recruited as part of the FTP-MOI management among the French resistance in the zone Nord. She was put in charge of developing women's resistance activity, including within immigrant communities (Polish, Italian, Spanish). During this period, she recruited many women who serves as liaison agents. In late 1943, she set up an underground printing press at Ch√¢tenay-Malabry in the home of another woman resistance member. This press, of which she took leadership, ran until May 1944, editing and printing copies of many tracts and underground newspapers of the resistance Front national. From May 1944, C√©cile Cerf became the head of FTP-MOI in the zone Nord for the establishment of patriotic militias. She was specifically with the Paris region and the departments of l'Yonne and the C√¥te d'Or. C√©cile Cerf performed her missions on a bicycle, specifically transporting the templates for underground tracts to the departments which she visited. During the same period, she performed missions in the Sa√¥ne et Loire, organising the resistance among women by aiding the Maquis.Attestation officielle du Capitaine FFI Gaston Laroche,n¬∞11 331, Commandant de d√©tachement, C.V.R 75 188 After the war, C√©cile Cerf co-founded the Commission Centrale de l'Enfance along with six other resistance members from the Union des juifs pour la R√©sistance et l'Entraide (UJRE) associated with the MNCR. Children's houses and fosters for teenagers were set up to receive the orphans who had escaped the genocide. Pedagogues, educators, leaders and inspectors were trained to deal with accepting the children. C√©cile Cerf was the first administrator of the newspaper Droit et Libert√©. Named editorial secretary of the progressive Yiddish daily Naie Presse (New Press), her goal was clear: the preservation of a language and culture, and the defense of republican freedoms. As manager of the Renouveau bookshop, she regularly held meeting of writers from all backgrounds to animate her encounters with the readership.Paris Rouge (1944‚Äì1964) par Jean-Pierre Bernard, Ed. Epoques- Champ Vallon, p.156 et suivantes In 1959, C√©cile Cerf organised a soir√©e to honour the Yiddish writer Sholem Aleichem at the Sorbonne, and a large-scale conference at UNESCO at the exhibition in honour of the Aleichem's centenary. C√©cile Cerf translated many novels by both classical and modern Yiddish authors totally unknown to the French public for the Presse Nouvelle Hebdomadaire (PNH). She also translated poetic texts from popular melodies. C√©cile Cerf strove for dialogue between cultures, for an independent Algeria, against the wars in Indochina and Vietnam, and for the defense of the oppressed, wherever they were.

It is an alternative to the hammermill or other forms of grinding mills. As the name implies, the conical mill varies in diameter from where the feed enters to where the product exits. The conical mill operates by having the product being fed into the mill by gravity or vacuum. A rotating impeller forces the material outward to a conical screen surface, where it is sized and passed through the openings in the screen. Once finished, the product simply drops through the milling chamber to a receptacle underneath. Conical mills come in a variety of sizes from tabletop lab models to full-size high-capacity machines for use in processing large quantities of material, and the impeller and screen can be customized for each individual use. The machines can be used not only to reduce the size of particles, but also for deagglomeration, sieving, dispersion, and mixing. The applications for a conical mill are varied, but trend towards use in the food, cosmetic, chemical, and pharmaceutical industries: *Reclaiming broken pharmaceutical tablets by grinding them back into powder for re-forming. *Sizing wet granulated particles before drying, and sizing dry granulated particles after they've dried before tabletting. *Delumping dry detergent during production *Dispersing pearl into blush and face powder *Deagglomerating dried fruits such as raisins or cranberries. *Creating breadcrumbs from scraps The conical mill has some marked advantages over the hammermill, especially in the pharmaceutical industry: low noise, heat and dust, a more uniform particle size, flexibility in design, and higher capacity. The concept of the conical mill was created in 1976 by the engineers of Quadro Engineering, who remains the foremost manufacturer of conical mills. Conical mills are available in Ex- execution with a variety of sieves and impellers. The mill head can be mounted on a mobile lifter which allows for easy up and down movement for docking into containers, tablet presses and others.

The team has since won 14 C1 World Championships (1993, 1995, 1996, 1999, 2000, 2001, and from 2007 to 2014), 8 European Championships (1999, 2000, 2001, 2004, 2007, 2009, 2010 and 2014), 7 Middle East Championships (2002, 2005 and from 2008 to 2012), 5 Pole Position Titles and 4 C2 World Championships (1996, 1998, 2000, 2001), making them one of the most successful teams in offshore powerboat racing. During the period 1999 to 2012, the team was run by Gianfranco Venturelli, a former Lamborghini, Ferrari and Chrysler executive. Under his tenure, the team moved to purpose- built 15,000 sq.m facilities enabling a ramp-up in manufacturing, engineering, operational and logistics capabilities to support both racing and commercial activities. Engineering projects were wholly managed in-house, with support from external suppliers primarily from the automotive industry. The team notably carried out its own power and drive train development, using its state of the art testing facilities, and were the only team with the in-house capability and infrastructure to conduct cutting edge R&D.; The team builds its own boats in-house, utilizing designs by Michael Peters, the majority of teams, including Bj√∏rn Rune Gjelsten's Spirit of Norway, uses boats built by Victory. The team scored its eighth world title in 2008. Commercial Division In 2002, the team branched out to build boat custom made commercially for use in not just powerboat racing and for pleasure, but boats for commercial maritime vessels, notably patrol boats There are currently four boats in its range: *56 Fast Yacht *VT-P56 Patrol *VT-P46 Patrol *VT-56 Fast Fishing Incidents In 1995, one of its drivers, the 1994 Class One champion, Hamed Buhaleeba, was killed whilst leading the race when his boat somersaulted and landed upside down during a Class 2 race at Cowes, in the Isle of Wight. His boat hit a wave, flew out of the water, only for it to land upside down and was trapped in the boat. His boat was reached by emergency crews, where he was taken to a hospital in Gosport and was pronounced dead later. Hamed, who was acting as a throttleman for his brother Rashid, who was uninjured. A trophy was named in honour of him which is awarded to the highest placed oversea competitor at the Cowes-Torquay race. In 1993, during the Class 1 World Championship, held at Ischia, in the Tyrrhenian sea, one of its boat, driven by Saeed Al Tayer and Felix Serralles, in an attempt to overtake their teammates Khalfan Harib and Ed Colyer, went wide and crashed into jury's boat that had drifted onto the course, sinking it instantly, instantly killing the boat owner Francesco Rando and an 18-year-old boy who was on the boat, where he died from injuries after being taken to hospital. Four other people and the drivers escaped with minor injuries. 11 December 2009: Dubai (UAE): Pilots Mohammad Al Mehairi from the UAE, and Jean-Marc Sanchez of France, were killed following a racing accident during race one of the Dubai Grand Prix, the final round of the Class 1 World Powerboat Championship. The two pilots, representing the Dubai Victory Team, were involved in a high-speed crash during the early stages of the race at the Dubai International Marine Club, which was subsequently red flagged. Safety personnel attended to both pilots at the scene. They were subsequently airlifted to a local hospital, where all efforts to resuscitate them were in vain. As a mark of respect to both pilots and their families the event organisers cancelled the final days racing.

Biography  Nicoletti is considered a pioneer in Bioclimatic urban and architectural design. In the 1970s his book L'ecosistema urbano (The Urban Ecosystem) - a term which he coined - creates a connection between environmental matters and psychological and cultural values. In this volume experts in various disciplines such as psychology, anthropology, biology, engineering, botanics, urban history, economy and acoustics contribute to open a rich discussion on the theme of urban ecosystems. He founded and headed at the Rome University La Sapienza the course of Urban Morphology and Ecology in 1972 and later the course of Ecosystemic Architecture in 1995. Consultant in urban ecology for the Italian Government and the European Community. Member of Eurosolar and PLEA he was awarded the international prize WREN (World renewal energy network). Born in Rieti, Nicoletti began his artistic and intellectual career very young in the studio of Giacomo Balla. In Rome he studied under Pier Luigi Nervi and graduated in architecture in 1954. The same year he received a Fulbright Scholarship to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology where he took his master's degree in 1955. During that time he was a student of Buckminster Fuller, Pietro Belluschi, Eero Saarinen, and Louis Kahn. He worked in the studio of Walter Gropius and was assistant to Sigfried Giedion at Harvard University. Up to 1957 he collaborated with the studio of Minoru Yamasaki. Upon his return to Italy, Manfredi worked with Pier Luigi Nervi. As a member of the National Institute for Urban Studies he was one of the founders of the National Institute for Architecture together with Bruno Zevi. In 1962 he returned to MIT with a Sloan Grant and was a member of the Joint Center for Urban Studies. During the years 1963-1964 he travelled through Europe, the Middle East and Asia preparing studies of cave architecture which were later published in the essay of 1980 which won him the Comit√© International des Critiques d‚ÄôArchitecture prize. In 1963 he was a teacher of architecture at the Rhode Island School of Design. In 1965 he founded with Paul Maymont, Yona Friedman and Michel Ragon the Groupe International d‚ÄôArchitecture Prospective (GIAP). He is considered to have been a pioneer of Megastructural architecture.Pevsner/Honour/Fleming \\"Dictionary of architecture\\", Penguin, 1972 He taught in Aquila and Rome; he was full professor of architectural composition in Palermo from 1980 and in Rome from 1988. His engagement in studies on architecture of Art Nouveau brought him to the rediscovery of the work of the Italian architect Raimondo D'Aronco regarding whom he wrote the first monografy dedicated to his drawings and architecture in 1955 that was followed by a second in 1982. A founding Partner, together with Luca Nicoletti and Giulia Falconi, of Studio Nicoletti Associati, he was Emeritus professor of Architectural Composition at the Rome La Sapienza University, Vice President of the International Academy of Architecture, Member of the Academy of Architecture of Russia, Member of the International Academy of Architecture of Moscow and member of the Academy of Architecture of France. Honorary Fellow of the American Institute of Architects and of the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada. From the Minister of Culture of France he received the title of ‚ÄúCommandeur de l‚ÄôOrdre des Arts et des Lettres‚Äù. Twice awarded with the Dedalo Minosse Prize. His professional experience embraced many aspects of urban and architectural design, especially of public buildings, carried out in Europe, the United States, Africa, the Middle and Far East, where they were integrated with those of specialists in various scientific and technological sectors. A large part of his artistic and architectural archives is entrusted to the collections of FRAC Fonds r√©gional d'art contemporain and New National Museum of Monaco both located in France.

It is recognized for a highly unusual transparent, fluid-filled dome on its head, through which the lenses of its eyes can be seen. The eyes have a barrel shape and can be rotated to point either forward or straight up, looking through the fish's transparent dome. M. microstoma has a tiny mouth and most of its body is covered with large scales. The fish normally hangs nearly motionless in the water, at a depth of about to , using its large fins for stability and with its eyes directed upward. In the low light conditions it is assumed the fish detects prey by its silhouette. MBARI researchers Bruce Robison and Kim Reisenbichler observed that when prey such as small fish and jellyfish are spotted, the eyes rotate like binoculars, facing forward as it turns its body from a horizontal to a vertical position to feed. Robison speculates that M. microstoma steals food from siphonophores. M. microstoma has been known to science since 1939, but is not known to have been photographed alive until 2004. Old drawings do not show the transparent dome, as it is usually destroyed when brought up from the depths. It is broadly distributed across the northern Pacific Ocean, from the Bering Sea to Japan and Baja California.

He is notable as the first head of the Hellenic Army General Staff and as the first commander of the Army of Epirus during the First Balkan War.  Early career  The son of Lieutenant General Vasileios Sapountzakis, he was born in Nafplio in 1846. He entered the Hellenic Army Academy, graduating as an artillery adjutant in 1865. He became a second lieutenant on 9 May 1867, a lieutenant in 1873, captain II class in 1878, captain I class in 1880, major in 1882, lieutenant colonel in 1890, and full colonel in 1896. In 1867 he returned to Crete and with his father fought in the ongoing Cretan uprising. Following the failure of the revolt, he was sent for studies abroad, in Germany, Britain and France. He was appointed professor of military technology at the Army Academy, as well as tutor and aide de camp to Crown Prince Constantine. At the outbreak of the Greco-Turkish War of 1897, with the rank of colonel, he assumed the duties of chief of staff to the Crown Prince, who exercised the overall command of the main Greek field force, the Army of Thessaly. Badly trained and led, the Greek Army was defeated and forced to retreat. Sapountzakis was subsequently dismissed from his duties.  Chief of the General Staff and Balkan Wars  Photograph of Lt Gen Sapountzakis In 1899, he was named head of the Personnel Department in the Ministry for Military Affairs, and in 1901 he was made chief of staff of the Army General Command, which became the Hellenic Army General Staff in 1904, with Sapountzakis its first head. From this position, he supervised the reorganization of the Army under the Georgios Theotokis cabinets. Marble bust of Lt Gen Sapountzakis at the Emin Aga inn, Ioannina. Promoted to major General in 1909, in 1910‚Äì12 he was Chief of the Army Staff Service of the Ministry for Military Affairs. On 9 April 1912 he was appointed prospective commander-in-chief of the Army of Thessaly in wartime, as well as chairman of the Revisionary Military Tribunal. In the same year he was promoted to lieutenant general. With the outbreak of the First Balkan War, on 5 October 1912, he was placed in charge of the Army of Epirus, a post he held until 11 February 1913. The Army of Epirus was by far the smaller of the two field armies fielded by Greece and effectively comprised a small infantry division, with 8,197 men and 24 guns. Faced with superior Ottoman forces (some 15,000 men with 32 guns of the 23rd Regular and 23rd Reserve Divisions) as well as the strongly fortified position of Bizani, which guarded the southern approaches to Ioannina, its mission was entirely secondary to the main Army of Thessaly, led again by Crown Prince Constantine. Nevertheless, the Greeks advanced and took Preveza on 21 October 1912, and repulsed an Ottoman counteroffensive in the Battle of Pente Pigadia on 24‚Äì30 October. Operations subsequently stalled as both sides awaited reinforcements. With the arrival of the 2nd Infantry Division, the Greeks resumed their offensive towards Ioannina on 12 December. Despite early success and the capture of Aetorrachi ridge, the Greek assault faltered against the guns of Bizani and successive Ottoman counter-offensives. The offensive was over by December 10, and operations degenerated into positional warfare. As more forces were being pulled from Macedonia towards Epirus, Crown Prince Constantine came to assume command in Epirus in January 1913, while Sapountzakis was relegated to command a detachment comprising the 6th and 8th Infantry Divisions. From this post he participated in the final capture of Bizani and Ioannina on 22 February 1913. Following the fall of Ioannina, Sapountzakis retired from the Army. He was appointed director of the Army Pension Fund in 1926‚Äì29, and died in 1931. He was married but had no children.

History The band's debut self-titled album was released worldwide in April 2010 (distributed by Shellshock), coinciding with a seven date tour of Germany and ten date tour of the UK. It features the likes of Nick Hemming from The Leisure Society on banjo and mandolin, Mike Siddell from Hope of the States and Lightspeed Champion on the violin and Will Calderbank from The Miserable Rich on the cello. Critics described the album as a more orchestral take on the American nu-folk movement, as \\"equal parts Shostakovich and Will Oldham\\". The lead single 'The Wreck is Not a Boat' received airplay on BBC Radio 1 and BBC 6 Music from Rob Da Bank, Gideon Coe and more. The band then toured the UK twice with friends Mumford & Sons and gigged extensively, performing with the likes of David Grubbs, Peggy Sue, Red Sparowes, Rothko, David Thomas Broughton and Alessi's Ark. In 2009 the band played several high-profile London shows: the Royal Festival Hall with Laura Marling, the Barbican with Jaga Jazzist and Efterklang with the Britten Sinfonia, the Union Chapel with The Leisure Society and The Roundhouse, performing a live score for Antonin Artaud's La Coquille et le clergyman. Marcus Mumford of Mumford & Sons joined the band on stage for their performance of \\"Indigo\\", playing drums and singing. This performance can be seen on the live bonus DVD with the special edition of Laura Marling's second album, I Speak Because I Can. The band went on to release the Rivers EP as a 7\\" on OIB Records and play many festivals including End of the Road Festival, The Big Chill and Green Man. In April 2011 the band completed a twelve date tour of Europe and announced via Facebook that they had completed recording their second album, titled Knots. In March 2012, Broken Sound and Willkommen Records confirmed the album's title and announced a release date of 21 May 2012 supported by a short UK tour. The band members are noted for being extremely collaborative. As well as almost every member of the band having a solo project, and all of them collaborating with other musicians from within the Willkommen Collective, in 2011 two members performed some shows with Damo Suzuki of krautrock band Can and two performed as the horn section for Broken Social Scene's tour of the UK. In 2012 four members of the band performed as part of Laura Marling's band on the Pyramid stage at Glastonbury festival and featured on her album Live at York Minster. Their second album, Knots, was released in 2012. Critics noted a marked departure from the debut, exploring and combining a wider array of genres, especially the \\"influence of Chicago's avant-garde rock and jazz scene and guitarists such as former Slint-man David Pajo in particular\\". The band's third album, Turquoise Purple Pink, was released on 25 November 2016. The album marked another change in style - after hearing the new material at Green Man Festival, Kathryn Bromwich of The Observer wrote, \\"In the front: two girls doing Cocteau Twins-like ethereal vocals and faultlessly choreographed dance moves, occasionally breaking off for a drum or clarinet solo. In the back: the band (three on guitar and bass, two drummers) blast out funky basslines, building crescendo and noise levels that would make My Bloody Valentine proud.\\" The Quietus described the new material as \\"a defiantly electric brand of muscular jazz-rock that recalls the acceptable face of early seventies prog; Soft Machine, later Traffic and the 'Rock In Opposition' movement, somewhere between Henry Cow and Magma.\\" Tom Robinson premiered the track, \\"I Love You So Much I Want To Stab You In The Eye\\", on his BBC Radio 6 Music show on 31 October 2016. The band did a five date tour of Germany then went on Tom Robinson's show to perform a four track live session on Saturday 4 March 2017. Stuart Maconie replayed one of the live tracks on his Freak Zone show on Sunday 9 April 2017.

The Chairman of this committee was Balwantrai G Mehta. The committee submitted its report on 24 November 1957 and recommended the establishment of the scheme of 'democratic decentralisation' which finally came to be known as Panchayati Raj. The main aim of Panchayat raj system is to settle the local problems locally and to make the people politically conscious. The report of the Team for the Study of the Community Projects and National Extension Service, Chaired by Balwantray G. Mehta in 1957 is attached here.  Recommendations  The specific recommendations of the committee are: # Establishment of a 3-tier Panchayati Raj system - Gram Panchayat at the village level, Panchayat Samiti at the block level, and District Parishad at the district level. These tiers should be organically linked through a device of indirect elections. The main purpose of this division is to simplify and to decrease the work load of the state and central government[MSD]. # The village Panchayat should be constituted with directly elected representatives, whereas the Panchayat Samiti and Zilla Parishad should be constituted with indirectly elected members. This is because Panchyat is similar to that of state assembly where there is place for politics where as Samiti and Zilla Parishad members should be more educated and knowledgeable and may not need the majority support. # All planning and developmental activities should be entrusted to these bodies. # The Panchayat Samiti should be the executive body while the Zilla Parishad should be the advisory, coordinating and supervisory body. # The District Collector should be the Chairman of the Zilla Parishad. # There should be a genuine transfer of power and responsibility to these democratic bodies. # Sufficient resources should be transferred to these bodies to enable them to discharge their functions and fulfil their responsibilities. # A system should be evolved to effect further devolution of authority in future. # Irrespective of political parties, Elections has to be constituted for every 5 years in a genuine way.

Another G. The Model G is a small implement carrier tractor that was made by the Allis-Chalmers Manufacturing Company. At the time of its introduction the Model G was unique for its rear-mounted, Continental N62 engine.Tractor Has Rear Engine, Popular Science, August 1948, p. 131 It was a four-cylinder engine with a 2‚Öú √ó 3¬Ω inch bore and stroke.Allis-Chalmers Model G at tractordata.com The Model G was designed for small farms and vegetable gardeners, and a line of implements specifically designed for it, including ploughs, planters, and cultivators. The design of the Model G allowed for a great view of the belly-mounted implements. Details The Model G was manufactured solely in the factory in Gadsden, Alabama, from 1948 to 1955. 29,976 units were built, which is less than Allis-Chalmers had originally hoped for. The Model G had a 5 gallon fuel tank, weighed 1,285 pounds, and was rated at 10 drawbar horsepower (Tested at 10.33 belt and 9.04 drawbar). The engine had a displacement of 62 cubic inches and was rated at 1800 RPMs. The transmission was a non-synchronized three-speed with reverse. An additional 'creeper' forward gear was standard equipment as well. Electric conversions The unique design of the Model G lends itself extremely well to electric vehicle conversion; a small DC electric motor replaces the original engine and bolts directly to the transmission housing through a commercially available adapter plate. A contactor and electronic motor controller are typically mounted to the same plate. Batteries are mounted in a box above the motor, where they are easily accessible for routine maintenance. The overall weight distribution mimics the tail-heavy design of the original tractor power train, which requires a visible nose counterweight. Over 100 Allis Chalmers model G tractors are known to have been converted as of 2009. In 2018, students from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln partnered with Tuff-bilt Tractors (based on the model G) to build an electric Tuff-bilt prototype.

The initial board of directors included Mathew Davison and William A. Paterson both mayors of the City of Flint. Paterson was also a carriage, and a car manufacturer. Another director was James Hurley, who was known by his foundational donations for the city's Hurley Hospital. The bank's first president was Charles T. Bridgman, and Wilder served as the cashier. Mathew Davison later succeeded Wilder as the bank's cashier. Later, George H. Durand and William F. Stewart joined the Board of Directors. Paterson and W. H. Edwards were appointed Vice-Presidents in 1916, and Davison became Chairman of the Board. Additionally, in 1916 L. H. Bridgman became cashier, and J. E. Storer became his assistant cashier. On May 1, 1929, the Bank merged with Industrial Savings Bank to become Union Industrial Trust & Savings Bank.

Annis (March 27, 1913 ‚Äì September 14, 2009) was a Florida surgeon who served as president of the American Medical Association and as president of the World Medical Association. He was one of the most foremost critics of the United States Medicare program.  Biography  Annis was born on March 27, 1913 in Detroit, Michigan. He graduated from Annunciation High School and the University of Michigan. In 1938, he received his Doctorate of Medicine from Marquette University School of Medicine and was a member of Phi Chi Medical Fraternity. He completed his surgical residency at Cook County Graduate School of Surgery. He moved to Florida, practicing medicine in Tallahassee. In 1953, he became chief of surgery at Mercy Hospital in Miami. Annis demonstrated talent as a public speaker while in high school and college, and became a member of the AMA's speaker's bureau in December 1959. As such, he traveled throughout the United States making speeches on the AMA's behalf. From January 1961 to June 1962, Annis made a series of speeches against the King Anderson bill, which would authorize the use of Social Security taxes to pay for health care benefits for retirees. He debated Democratic Senator Hubert Humphrey and the president of the U.A.W. on television. After President Kennedy gave a speech on May 20, 1962, at Madison Square Gardens describing the bill's benefits, Annis was refused equal time in which to counter the President's arguments. The President explained the bill's intent. \\"...we say that during his working years, he shall contribute to Social Security as he has in the case of his retirement, $12 or $13 a month. When he becomes ill, or she becomes ill over a long period of time. he pays $90 so that people will not abuse it, but then lets say that he has a bill of $1,500...of which $1000 is hospital bills. This bill will pay that $1000 in hospital bills and then I believe, he and the effort he makes with his family can meet his other responsibilities. Now that does not seem such an extraordinary piece of legislation.\\" ... \\"they (the doctors) do not comprehend what we are trying to do.\\" .... \\"we do not cover doctor's bills here\\"...\\"we do not affect the freedom of choice, you can go to any doctor you want.\\" The AMA then rented the Gardens and prime time television so that Annis and Leonard Larson, then the president of the AMA, could argue against passage.AMA - 1961 to 1979 The AMA's efforts resulted in the King-Anderson Bill dying in committee in 1962 and 1963. Dr. Edward Annis eloquently predicted: \\"The King- Anderson Bill is a cruel hoax and illusion. It wastefully covers millions who do not need it, heartlessly ignores millions who do need coverage. It is not true insurance. It will create an enormous and unpredictable burden on every working taxpayer. It offers sharply limited benefits. It will lower the quality and availability of hospital services throughout our country.\\" \\" IT WILL STAND BETWEEN THE PATIENT AND HIS DOCTOR.\\" Dr. Annis held up the bill that he had actually read, and discovered cost-plus financing buried deep in the small type. He warned that cost-plus financing of Medicare would doom it to bankruptcy and trigger destruction of the doctor-patient relationship. \\"This bill would put the government smack into your hospital, defining services, setting standards, establishing committees, calling for reports, deciding who gets in and who gets out, what they get and what they do not get, even getting into the teaching of medicine.\\" Buoyed by his popularity from the anti-Medicare campaign, Annis successfully ran for the AMA presidency in June 1962, taking office in June 1963. While AMA president, he intensified the AMA's resistance to Medicare. Annis' term expired in June 1964. Dr. Annis predicted that the cost-plus financing of Medicare would doom it to bankruptcy and trigger destruction of the doctor-patient relationship. \\"This bill would put the government smack into your hospital, defining services, setting standards, establishing committees, calling for reports, deciding who gets in and who gets out, what they get and what they do not get, even getting into the teaching of medicine.\\" \\"And it will serve as a forerunner of a different system of medicine for all Americans.\\" (socialized medicine) He predicted that \\"socialized medicine\\" would have consequences for American healthcare including loss of physician autonomy to bureaucratic control and the imposition of government regulation into the patient-physician relationship. He authored the partly autobiographical, Code Blue: Health Care In Crisis () in which he reprises his analysis of Medicare's effects, laying most of what he felt is wrong with American health care at the feet of what he viewed as socialist changes without mention of its benefits. He saw the solution as ending the current third party payer system, eliminating state-mandated insurance, and tort reform.[Journal of the American Medical Association. July 6, 1994.

He was the creator of The Birkman Method, a workplace psychological assessment. Birkman received his Ph.D. in psychology in 1961 from the University of Texas at Austin. He was the founder and chairman of the board of Birkman International, Inc. Career Birkman began his studies in psychology at the University of Houston before enlisting in the United States Army Air Corps and becoming a B-17 bomber pilot. He became interested in the exploration of individual psychological differences while serving during World War II. His experiences with the impact that perceptions, and misperceptions, among his crew and fellow pilots had on performance led him to the study of social psychology. He began developing The Birkman Method in the late 1940s while working with a group of scientists at the University of Houston surveying psychological instruments for pilot selection by the Air Force. Birkman sought to create a single instrument that would measure self- concepts, social expectations, stress behaviors, and occupational interests valuable to both work and life. By 1951, he had completed his first iteration called the \\"Test of Social Comprehension.\\" A self-report questionnaire eliciting responses about perception of self, social context, and occupational opportunities. Scales were empirically developed by comparing self-report item results with descriptions of likes, dislikes and behaviors provided by third parties. The Birkman Method took its final form in his 1961 doctoral dissertation. His work aligns with the social psychology theories of the organizational psychologist Kurt Lewin. Birkman authored two books: True Colors (1995) and A Man of Understanding (2002). He was certified as a Licensed Psychologist in the State of Texas and was a member of the American Psychological Association, the Southwestern Psychological Association, Society for Industrial & Organizational Psychology, and the Texas Psychological Association. He died in his sleep on March 26, 2014, at the age of 95.http://en.hectorverdu.cat/2014/03/dr-b-legacy-remains.htmlMention of Roger Birkman's death, Birkman International The Birkman Method The Birkman Method is an online personality, social perception, and occupational interest assessment consisting of ten scales describing occupational preferences (Interests), 11 scales describing ‚Äúeffective behaviors‚Äù (Usual behaviors) and 11 scales describing interpersonal and environmental expectations (Needs or Expectations). A corresponding set of 11 scale values was derived to describe \\"less than effective\\" behaviors (Stress behaviors). Occupational profiling consists of 22 job families with more than 200 corresponding job titles all connected to O*Net. The construction and comparative analysis of the Birkman Method is designed to provide insight into what specifically drives a person's behavior, with the goal of creating greater choice and more self- responsibility. It attempts to measure social behaviors, underlying expectations of interpersonal and task actions, potential stress reactions to unmet expectations, occupational preferences and organizational strengths. It is empirically supported by reliability and validity studies, including studies using classical test theory (CTT) and item response theory (IRT). The Birkman Method has 3 different types of assessments available. Further reading and viewing * Birkman Fink, Sharon & Capparell, Stephanie. (2013). The Birkman Method: Your Personality at Work.

History and profile The magazine was first published in December 1984 by co-founders Marion Lavigne and Ronne Heming. They head Up Here Publishing Ltd. The magazine's first editor was Eric Watt, and its current editorial team includes Jessica Davey- Quantick, Jacob Boon, Beth Brown and John Pekelsky as art director. Rod Raycroft was the art director for the first 26 issues. John Allerston provided layout and illustration for the publications in the early years. The readership is about 100,000 readers per issue, according to the publishers. Up Here is offered as an in-flight magazine on Canadian North, an airline serving Canada's North. That caused the magazine some problems with its July/August 2006 issue, which had a cover story on naked hiking. The cover image showed a naked hiker from behind, with type covering his buttocks. After a passenger on Canadian North complained, the magzine had to spend $5,000 on short notice to create a new cover for the airline depicting a fish in order to keep its promise of seat-pocket distribution to its advertisers. In 2019 the editors recalled that issues as Up Heres costliest. In 2012 the magazine was published eight times a year. In January 2015 Up Here absorbed its sister magazine, Up Here Business. Up Here Business returned as a quarterly magazine in 2018. Focus The magazine exclusively features articles on Canada's North, including the territories north of the 60th parallel, Yukon, NWT and Nunavut, as well as areas in Canada's provinces that are part of the Arctic, such as Churchill, Manitoba, or northern and remote, like Atlin, British Columbia, Nunavik in northern Quebec and Nunatsiavut in northern Labrador. Its articles are in the genre of creative non-fiction, and cover social, political, historical, aboriginal, travel and geographical details of Canada's North. Up Here also covers cultural events in the region, including reviews of Inuktitut music by performers like The Jerry Cans, Riit, and Becky Han. Awards and recognition Up Here and its publishers and writers have won several awards. In 2010, Up Here was awarded the prestigious Magazine of the Year honours from the National Magazine Awards, as well as its written articles receiving six honourable mentions. In 2004, Lavigne was awarded the Lifetime Achievement award by the Western Magazine Awards. That same year, then-editor Aaron Spitzer was awarded the Best Article, NWT/Alberta Western Magazine Award for his story, \\"The Shadow in the Valley.\\" In 2002, former editor Cooper Langford won the Western Magazine Profile Award for his story, \\"The Fast Runner.\\" In 2014, Up Here was awarded Magazine of the Year at the Western Magazine Awards.\\" ReferencesExternal links *Up Here magazine website Category:1984 establishments in the Northwest Territories Category:Lifestyle magazines published in Canada Category:Monthly magazines published in Canada Category:Magazines established in 1984 Category:Mass media in Yellowknife Category:Eight times annually magazines ","title":"Up Here (magazine)"},{"id":"21688862","text":"Tumulduria is a Cambrian small shelly fossil.

Map of Corps District Commands of Poland in 1939  The districts  The interbellum Poland was since 1921 divided into ten Corps District Commands: * Corps District Command number I (Warsaw, in 1939 under General Mieczys≈Çaw Ry≈õ-Trojanowski), * Corps District Command number II (Lublin, General Mieczys≈Çaw Smorawi≈Ñski), * Corps District Command number III (Grodno, General J√≥zef Olszyna-Wilczy≈Ñski), * Corps District Command number IV (≈Å√≥d≈∫, General Wiktor Thomm√©e), * Corps District Command number V (Krak√≥w, General Aleksander Narbutt-≈Åuczy≈Ñski), * Corps District Command number VI (Lw√≥w, General W≈Çadys≈Çaw Langner), * Corps District Command number VII (Pozna≈Ñ, General Edmund Knoll-Kownacki), * Corps District Command number VIII (Toru≈Ñ, General Micha≈Ç Karaszewicz-Tokarzewski), * Corps District Command number IX (Brze≈õƒá nad Bugiem, General Franciszek Kleeberg), * Corps District Command number X (Przemy≈õl, General Wac≈Çaw Wieczorkiewicz). Furthermore, for military purposes, one special area was created, and it was not governed by the local Corps District Commands. It was Coastal Area of Gdynia (Obszar Nadmorski Gdynia), which, apart from the city of Gdynia itself, covered whole Polish Baltic Sea coastline, together with Puck, W≈Çadys≈Çawowo, Hel, Kartuzy, and Wejherowo. The Coastal Area of Gdynia was created in July 1937.

Mortimer is in the local government district of West Berkshire and is seven miles south-west of Reading. History and Name Historian David Nash Ford believes the name Mortimer stems from the Lords of the Manor, the Mortimer family, a powerful magnate family and the Earls of March from Wigmore, Herefordshire. The family were given the manor, along with Wigmore Castle by William I shortly after the Norman Conquest and held it throughout the Middle Ages, as recorded in the Domesday Book. Roger de Mortimer, 1st Earl of March was for three years de facto ruler of England after leading a successful rebellion against Edward II, before being overthrown and executed in 1330 by Edward III, with his lands (including Mortimer) seized by the crown. The Mortimers came close, during the reign of Richard II, to the English throne again, but the claims of the family were ignored and the throne was vested in Henry IV instead. During the Tudor period Mortimer was one of the lands granted to each of the wives of Henry VIII. There are several Bronze Age burial mounds in the area. Excavations at one have shown that it was later used for burials when the Anglo-Saxons moved into the area. In 1976 Princess Anne visited Mortimer as part of a horse display at Mortimer Fairground. Geography Mortimer Common Barrows. Holden's Firs Barrows, Barrow Cemetery Mortimer stands at the top of Mortimer Hill, at the bottom of which is Stratfield Mortimer. To the north lies Burghfield Common and Wokefield. To the West lies Mortimer West End and Padworth Common. The Lockram Brook flows through the middle of the parish and joins into Burghfield Brook further to the Northeast, this in turn feeds into Foudry Brook, a tributary of the Kennet and Avon Canal. There is much woodland in the area, including Starvale Woods, Wokefield Common and Holden Firs. The three main roads in Mortimer are The Street, West End Road and Victoria Road. Transport Bus travel from Reading is provided by Reading Buses services 2 and 2a. Mortimer railway station, on the Reading to Basingstoke Line, is down The Street from the main village, and frequent services are operated by Great Western Railway. Sport and leisure Mortimer Village Partnership (MVP) is an independent not for profit organisation that was set up by volunteers in 2009. The purpose of MVP is to involve people and groups in the life of the village, to improve communications, to connect people together and facilitate activities and events in order to enhance the lives of those who live and work in Mortimer and nearby. Several events are organised annually. including a regular lunch club, theatre trips, travelling theatres, events for children and the famous annual Mortimer Fun Day in July which attracts thousands of visitors from all around. In 2014 the group was awarded The Queen's Award for Voluntary Service and it continues to recognise the hundreds of volunteers annually by presenting them with a certificate and the addition of their name into a book of honour.

Mortimer Football Club was founded as the Mortimer Garth Club by Miss Bertha G. P. Capron of Garth House (and later of Little Garth), Mortimer. Miss Capron also paid for the construction of a hall for the Garth Club, known as the Garth Hall, in 1915. Miss Capron (1863-1954) was the eldest daughter of the Rev. George Halliley Capron of Southwick Hall and Stoke Doyle, Northamptonshire, and settled in Mortimer with her unmarried sisters after her brother inherited the Southwick estates in 1909. Mortimer FC is currently in the Reading Football League Senior Division, in tier 11 of the football pyramid. Mortimer has won the League four times; in 1993-4, 1994‚Äì5, 1996‚Äì7 and 2001‚Äì02. Mortimer has amateur cricket and tennis clubs, cubs, scouts, girl guides and brownies clubs as well as the Mortimer Dramatic Society. A community centre was completed in the autumn of 2009, which is used as a cricket pavilion. The fairground is also used for travelling funfairs.

Historical context Music at the French court at Versailles flourished during the time of Louis XIV (1638‚Äì1715). Although Bernard de Bury (1720‚Äì1785) lived after this monarch, the positions for musicians set up under the \\"Sun King\\" would continue well into the eighteenth century. There were over 150 official musicians at the court. Music as an institution on a grand scale at Versailles was thus set in place before Bernard de Bury was born. Bernard de Bury resided in Versailles his entire life, and held various positions at the court. Many from his musical family also held court appointments. He studied music with his father, as well as with Fran√ßois Collin de Blamont (1690‚Äì1760), to whom he dedicated his Premier Livre de Pi√®ces de Clavecin, published when he was just fifteen years old. De Bury acquired the post of ordinaire de la chambre pour le clavecin (\\"king's chamber harpsichordist\\") in 1741. He continued a long distinguished line of musicians who held this position, which had passes from Jacques-Champion Chambonni√®res (1601/2‚Äì1672) to Jean-Henri D'Anglebert (1635‚Äì1691) to Fran√ßois Couperin (1668‚Äì1733), to his daughter, Margu√©rite-Antoinette Couperin (1705‚Äìc. 1778), and then to de Bury. The publication date for Bernard de Bury's Premier Livre de Pi√®ces de Clavecin is not entirely certain. In his dedication, de Bury states that he was fifteen years old at the time the suites were written; this would place their composition in 1735 or 1736, since he would not reach his sixteenth birthday until well into the latter year. The publication was announced in the Mercure de France in January 1737, leading one to believe that the suites were actually published late in 1736. Musical analysis A long, rich tradition of French harpsichord compositions preceded the publication of the harpsichord suites by Bernard de Bury, and he himself contributed to the legacy that would continue to be built throughout most of the century. He, like so many others, was influenced by Fran√ßois Couperin, as well as Jean-Philippe Rameau, the two titans of French harpsichord music of the eighteenth century. For example, most all of his movements are given titles, even when also identified as a dance movement (and even when the dance is not identified). In addition, ten times the popular form of a rondeau is used (counting second rondeaux and doubles). Furthermore, frequent changes in texture can be seen, ornaments can be identified from the tables of Couperin and Rameau, and notes in√©gales are appropriate, unless a movement is in Italian style. Examples of Italian influences can be seen in arpeggiated figures, passage work, imitation, circle of fifths progressions, and occasional frequent modulations. In keeping with French aesthetic, most suites end with tender sublimity rather than with impressive virtuosity. =Premiere suite= The first suite of Bernard de Bury's Premier Livre de Pi√®ces de Clavecin has \\"A\\" as its home key, movements being in either A major or A minor. In La Minerve, a character piece, de Bury makes reference to the Roman goddess of wisdom and arts. Sarabande, Les Regrets is followed by a gavotte entitled Les graces Badines (\\"Graceful Triflers\\"). The title could be referring to \\"amorous badinage\\" or \\"amorous playfulness.\\" La Tendre Agitation is a wonderfully inventive character piece in binary form. A pair of rondeaux, Le Plaidoyer de Cithere 1er Rondeau and 2e Rouneau, close out the first suite. The title can be translated as \\"In Defense of [the Island of] Cythera\\". These movements, along with La Cither√©e from the second suite as well as Fran√ßois Couperin's Les P√©lerines, all make reference to this island birthplace of Venus which was a special place for lovers. In addition, artist Jean-Antoine Watteau (1684‚Äì1721) produced two paintings on the same subject. This movement is one of a number marked Gracieusement sans lenteur (\\"gracefully, not too slowly\\"). Gracieusement implies the freedom to change the beat, or to apply rubato in accordance with the affekt. =Seconde suite= The second suite is in C minor, with only the first rondeau of La Cither√©e being in C major. La belle Brune (\\"The Pretty Brunette\\") is followed by the binary Sarabande La Prude which is serious in tone and complex harmonically. L'Enfantine refers to a \\"child-like\\" manner, demonstrated by frequent shifts of range. Both the first and second rondeaux of La Cither√© are unnamed gavottes. L'Enfantine and La Cither√© are also marked Gracieusement. =Troisi√®me suite= Six of the eleven movements of this longest suite are rondeaux. They bookend this collection, with a paired set to open and a second paired set (plus doubles for each) to close. Centering on \\"G\\", seven of the eleven movements are in the minor mode. Les Amusemens (\\"The Amusements\\") could also be translated as \\"Entertainment\\". Ornaments help provide forward motion to the opening cheerful syncopated rondeau theme. We will never know to what or whom the *** in La *** ou les Sentimens (\\"The *** or the Sentiments\\" or \\"Feelings\\") refers. The indication of Gracieusement adds further to the tender, expressive affekt of the movement. Typical of a sarabande, this triple time slow, serious piece, with balanced phrases and complex harmonies, sometimes places an accent on the second beat. The two movements entitled ∆µephir (the mythological West Wind of spring) and Flore (a reference to the mythological Goddess of Flowers) are in the form of the popular French dance, the menuet, the latter more dramatic and complex harmonically. La Pithonisse (\\"The Pythoness\\") was the priestess presiding over the Oracle of Apollo at Delphi, located on Mount Parnassus. It was commonly believed that the vapors rising from the ground induced the priestesses to deliver the oracles in a frenzied state. This intensity is conveyed in this central movement conceived on a grand scale. The 18th-century loure was a slow, virtuosic, noble, majestic dance. This binary form Loure in 6/4 meter is characterized by many low-ranging thick chords. Also marked Gracieusement, paired La S√©duisante (\\"The Seductress\\") rondeaux are followed by paired cariations (Double du 1er Rondeau, Double du 2e Rondeau). =Quatri√®me suite= The final suite is mostly in E major, with only the second movement and the middle section of the final movement in E minor. La Brillante is certainly a \\"Brilliant\\" opening piece. Almost all of the first three sections (rondeau theme and first two couplets) are written in the bright upper range of the harpsichord, both staves requiring treble clef. La Dampiere is a dramatic sarabande reminiscent of Fran√ßois Couperin's La T√©n√©breuse and La Rapha√©le. La Michelon is a lively, joyful Italian giga. La Jeunesse (\\"Youth\\") is a menuet. Chaconne is in E major, but has an extended middle section in the parallel mode of E minor. The form is built of groups of four measures which are immediately repeated for a total of eight in each unit. The chaconne in this collection comes a close second to one by Jacques Duphly (1715‚Äì1789) as the longest single, continuous Pi√©ce de clavecin of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.

Yearwood caught the eye in August 2003 when he took 7/37 for Barbados Under-19s against their Leeward Islands equivalents in the TCL Regional Under 19 Challenge; his captain Martin Nurse said that Yearwood had bowled with both pace and swing, and had bowled \\"very, very well\\"; while Yearwood himself said that he had \\"big goals\\" he wanted to achieve. He made his debut in List A cricket in early October 2003, when he represented West Indies Under-19s against Antigua and Barbuda in the 2003‚Äì04 Red Stripe Bowl. The match did not bring any success for him: he was out for nought as his team were dismissed for just 69, and bowled one ball ‚Äî the last of the match ‚Äî which went for four. A few days later he played in the same competition against the University of the West Indies. He did not bat, but took a single wicket, that of Jason Parris. As of February 2009 these remain his only List A appearances. In 2003/04 he was picked for the West Indies Under-19s' tour of Sri Lanka and the subsequent Under-19 World Cup in Bangladesh, and played in three Youth ODIs. His best bowling return in these matches was the 4/35 he claimed against Sri Lanka Under-19s in early February 2004. However, after this handful of appearances he never again played at this level. In 2007 Yearwood played club cricket in Ireland for Leinster Cricket Club. His most notable performance for the team came in early May, when he took 5/18 against Munster Reds. This feat helped Leinster record an easy nine-wicket victory, but it was all for naught as they were docked ten points for fielding an ineligible player. In Barbadian domestic cricket, Yearwood showed his batting ability in 2008, when he struck 153 from 118 balls for CGI Maple against Banks. He finally made his first- class debut at the end of January 2009, when he was selected to play in the Regional Four Day Competition for Barbados against Jamaica at Trelawny. Batting at nine in both innings, he made useful scores of 32 and 24, but he went wicketless from his nine overs.

On 11 December 1527 he was instituted to the vicarage of Hitchin, Hertfordshire, which he exchanged on 5 March 1531 for the rectory of Cottingham, Northamptonshire. He was archdeacon of Stow, 15 January 1543, and archdeacon of Huntingdon, 27 July 1543, both in the same church of Lincoln. On 2 December 1547 he was appointed by convocation head of a committee to draw up a form of a statute for paying tithes in cities. Draycot held a number of positions as rector of St Mary's Church, Wirksworth, North Wingfield, Kettering, and Grindon. He was chancellor for a time to John Longland, bishop of Lincoln, and to Ralph Baine, bishop of Coventry and Lichfield, acting against the Protestants. It is said that after giving a sermon on the day of Joan Waste's execution he then went home to eat. In 1553 he was one of the committee for the restitution of Bishop Edmund Bonner. At Elizabeth's accession he refused to take the oath of supremacy, and was stripped of all his preferments, except the rectory of Draycot. In 1560 he was in the Fleet Prison. He was allowed out to die at his family's home in Draycott in the Moors, on 20 January 1571.

Built in front of the Viharamahadevi Park, Colombo, Sri Lanka, it is the meeting place for the elected municipal council. In 1921 renowned Scottish town planner, Professor Patrick Geddes, recommended that the Council should construct a large central and dignified municipal building to house the council, a public reception hall, the mayor's office and a public library. The need for the Colombo Public Library was addressed by a philanthropic donation of a building by Dr. W. Arthur Silva in 1925. This building, Sirinivasa, is now the official residence of the mayor. In 1922 the Colombo Municipal Council held an international architectural design competition and in November that year of the 32 plans submitted, the winning design was drawn by S. J. Edwards, of the architectural firm Ralph Booty & Co. In awarding the prize the Government Architect of the Ceylon Public Works Department, Austin Woodeson, wrote: The foundation stone for the town hall was laid on 24 May 1924, by the Mayor of Colombo, Thomas Reid, CCS. The construction of the building was undertaken by A. A. Gammon & Co and four years later on 9 August 1928 it was formally opened by the Governor Sir Herbert Stanley KCMG. The cost of the new town hall was met largely by revenue generated by the Council, without taking out any loans from the central government and as a result, for years Municipal finances were depleted. Architectural design Dome and front porch Colombo Town Hall, 2017 Edwards' design draws heavily from L'Enfant's neoclassical style Capitol Building in Washington, D. C. The Council chamber is located in the centre of the block on the first floor surmounted by a dome. On either side and on the longitudinal axis is an open courtyard surrounded on each floor by the different departments of Council. The main entrance and staircase hall is situated at the centre of the front fa√ßade, facing directly onto Viharamahadevi Park, with the two staff entrances being at the two remote corners of the fa√ßade in the rear. There are six corinthian columns in the main porch, six on either side to the front and ten columns on either side of the building. The columns are each in height. The building is in length and in width and the total height of the building equals its width. Although many alterations have been made to the original design, the building still possesses a few characteristics that have not been touched by modern renovations. The council chamber and its furniture, including the original lamps and lamp bases are still intact. All the doors and windows of the building are original, as well as the ornamental lamps on the staircase leading to the second floor from the lobby.

The expansion is only valid if H(\\\\varepsilon) vanishes as \\\\varepsilon \\\\rightarrow -\\\\infty and goes no faster than polynomially in \\\\varepsilon as \\\\varepsilon \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty. If the integral is from zero to infinity, then the integral in the first term of the expansion is from zero to \\\\mu and the second term is unchanged.  Application to the free electron model  Integrals of this type appear frequently when calculating electronic properties, like the heat capacity, in the free electron model of solids. In these calculations the above integral expresses the expected value of the quantity H(\\\\varepsilon). For these integrals we can then identify \\\\beta as the inverse temperature and \\\\mu as the chemical potential. Therefore, the Sommerfeld expansion is valid for large \\\\beta (low temperature) systems. Derivation to second order in temperature We seek an expansion that is second order in temperature, i.e., to \\\\tau^2, where \\\\beta^{-1}=\\\\tau=k_BT is the product of temperature and Boltzmann's constant. Begin with a change variables to \\\\tau x=\\\\varepsilon -\\\\mu: :I=\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{H(\\\\varepsilon)}{e^{\\\\beta(\\\\varepsilon - \\\\mu)} + 1}\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\varepsilon = \\\\tau\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{H(\\\\mu+\\\\tau x)}{e^{x} + 1}\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}x \\\\,, Divide the range of integration, I=I_1+I_2, and rewrite I_1 using the change of variables x\\\\rightarrow-x: :I= \\\\underbrace{\\\\tau\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^0 \\\\frac{H(\\\\mu+\\\\tau x)}{e^{x} + 1}\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}x}_{I_1} + \\\\underbrace{\\\\tau\\\\int_{0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{H(\\\\mu+\\\\tau x)}{e^{x} + 1}\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}x}_{I_2}\\\\,. :I_1=\\\\tau\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^0 \\\\frac{H(\\\\mu+\\\\tau x)}{e^{x} + 1}\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}x =\\\\tau\\\\int_0^\\\\infty \\\\frac{H(\\\\mu-\\\\tau x)}{e^{-x} + 1}\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}x\\\\, Next, employ an algebraic 'trick' on the denominator of I_1, :\\\\frac{1}{e^{-x}+1} = 1-\\\\frac{1}{e^x+1}\\\\,, to obtain: :I_1=\\\\tau\\\\int_{0}^\\\\infty H(\\\\mu-\\\\tau x)\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}x -\\\\tau\\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} \\\\frac{H(\\\\mu-\\\\tau x)}{e^{x} + 1}\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}x\\\\, Return to the original variables with -\\\\tau \\\\mathrm{d}x = \\\\mathrm{d}\\\\varepsilon in the first term of I_1.

Bites Caused by Giant Water Bugs Belonging to Belostomatidae Family (Hemiptera, Heteroptera) in Humans: A Report of Seven Cases. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine 21: 130‚Äì133. The South American L. grandis and L. maximus are the only species to commonly exceed , with more typical lengths for the remaining species being between . Lethocerus sp. are distinguished from other genera in the Lethocerinae (Benacus and Kirkaldyia) by two symmetrical furrows in the inner pad of setae on the fore femur, the external borders of parasternites II and III narrowed and nearly straight, and with the setae of the tarsomeres following the line of the tibial setae. Habits Museum specimen of Lethocerus indicus, displayed with open wings Unlike giant water bugs in the subfamily Belostomatinae, females do not lay the eggs on the backs of males. Instead, after copulation (often multiple sessions) the eggs are laid on emergent vegetation (rarely on man-made structures) high enough above the waterline that the eggs will not be permanently submerged. The male then guards the eggs from predators and periodically brings water to the eggs to prevent their desiccation. Like other members of the giant water bug family, Lethocerus species are predators that overpower prey by stabbing it with the rostrum and injecting a venomous saliva. The rostrum can also be used in self-defense, and the bite is very painful to humans, but usually resolves within a few hours at most.

Silverman graduated from with distinction from Columbia College in 1928, and earned his law degree from Columbia Law School in 1930. Soon he became an assistant corporation counsel for New York City's government. Shortly thereafter he became a partner at a firm that would become Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison. During his tenure Silverman represented Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer, the nuclear physicist, at a 1954 loyalty hearing conducted by a panel of the Atomic Energy Commission. Later, Silverman represented Otto Frank, the father of Anne Frank, in a lawsuit over a proposed stage adaptation of the famous Diary of Anne Frank. Later career A Democrat, Silverman was elected to state supreme court in 1962. He served there for four years before in 1966 becoming involved in a highly- public campaign with then-Senator Robert F. Kennedy, egged on by Liberal Party leader Alex Rose, to end patronage corruption in New York's Surrogate Court. Specifically, members of the Democratic and Republican parties were cross endorsing each other's candidates for the court in order to promote individuals who would skim commission from inheritance cases and introduce some of these funds back into the political machine. (\\"Don't die in the city of New York, don't die--if you want to leave anything to your wife and children,\\" Kennedy exhorted.) Silverman won in a landslide, but his efforts at reform were hindered. In a 1967 constitutional convention Silverman's core proposal to abolish the surrogate court and reassign its jurisdiction to a rotation group of state supreme court justices was defeated. Silverman retired in 1971 from the surrogate court and returned to the state supreme court, frustrated by boredom, and reform failures, particularly frustrated with his hard-line senior colleague S. Samuel DiFalco (who was indicted for corruption charges in 1978, but died before the trial). Silverman was promoted to the Appellate Division in 1976. He remained at the state supreme court until he retired in 1984, when he returned as senior counsel for Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison. Silverman died at aged 92 at the Weill Cornell Medical Center of New York-Presbyterian Hospital.

Originally built as a house, within a decade it went into service as an inn when the Orange Turnpike, an early toll road through the area, opened in 1802. It takes its name from an early owner's reputed decision to paint it in a checkerboard pattern to attract business, although this has not been conclusively established. In the 20th century, it was expanded to serve as a family cottage for the family of a New York silk merchant, Moses Migel. Today, after many other owners and a long period of neglect, it remains standing, vacant, next to the golf course's clubhouse. It is the property of the Town of Monroe, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006. The town is hoping to raise the money to restore it and use it as a local history museum. Building The house is built into a gentle slope on a hill looking out over its section of the New York-New Jersey Highlands, and ultimately the Shawangunk Ridge in the distance. At the north end the foundations are visible. A small group of trees surrounds it on three sides. An old road grade is visible to the east. The older main section is one and a half stories high and five bays wide, sided in aluminum over old pine clapboards. In the center of the facade is the main entrance, a Federal style entrance with fluted pilasters supporting an entablature and cornice. The asbestos-shingled gabled roof is pierced by brick chimneys at either end. A badly deteriorated porch is attached to the rear. From the west end projects a double wing, one one-by-two-bay section continuing to the west, set slightly back, with a larger three-by-one section extending to the north. The east wing is similar to the west wing, just a little larger. A terrace is between the two wings in the rear. On the inside, the house follows a center-hall plan, with fireplaces heating either end. The walls are finished in plaster on lath, likely replaced since original construction. Most trim is original with the exception of a bathroom and nearby cabinet added in the 20th century. The basement is unfinished. History Between 1790 and 1810 the main block was built in a vernacular local style for a local farmer named Bernard Forshee. In 1802 the Orange Turnpike, which elsewhere in the county is today followed by state highways 17 and 17M, was routed past the house. A segment of its bed remains just to the east of the house. A milestone that was also next to it has since been stolen. At some point during the turnpike's years of operation, according to local lore, the house was converted to an inn for travelers. Since it was just south of what is today the village of Monroe, where there were many other inns, Forshee supposedly decided to distinguish the Forshee House by painting it in a black-and-white checkerboard pattern. He sold it to his son John in 1823, who in turn sold it to an Ira Jenkins ten years later. By that point many of the early turnpikes were going broke and reverting to public ownership and maintenance. It is believed that the house's use as an inn was discontinued, although the checkerboard pattern apparently remained long enough that traces of it continued to exist into the 20th century. In 1916 New York City silk merchant Moses Charles Migel bought the property and surrounding lands to make Greenbraes Farm, his estate. Since he wanted to build a stone barn and house nearby (today Mansion Ridge's clubhouse), it was necessary to relocate the road off the property, a move that also helped smooth out a steep descent into Monroe. The Migels paid for the road to be relocated and rebuilt along its current alignment; Mary Harriman granted a right-of-way. Three decades later, Migel's son Richard had grown and married. The two wings were added to the house to accommodate them in the late 1940s, and a shed-roof on the rear elevation, the only significant changes made during its existence. Original wrought iron hardware, which the Migels intended to retain, was accidentally melted down as scrap during this process. The house remained a private residence until the mid-1990s, when the last owners moved out. It then became the property of a developer, Great Expectations, which had acquired the entire former Migel Estate to develop into the current Mansion Ridge golf-and-condominium complex. As part of the approval process, Great Expectations donated the Checkerboard Inn to the Town of Monroe. Three years later the town began the process of seeking a state grant to remodel it into a local history museum., 3.

It is a rogue-like roleplaying video game (RPG) in which the player is tasked with descending to the 30th level of a dungeon to defeat the arch-daemon Xaskazien. Ancient DOS Games Episode 94 History The game was originally programmed through Borland C and relied heavily on the Borland Graphics libraries. In 2004 the game was ported to Windows by Jeff Schiller, and since that time has been updated regularly by original programmer, Jeff Sinasac, to reach its present status at VER 5.00. Main Release site at Codedread The game is hosted for download from dozens of websites as freeware, and has been downloaded by thousands. A sequel, with vastly improved graphics and gameplay, is currently in the works, with a planned release some time before the summer of 2013. Ancient DOS Games Episode 94 Gameplay While original versions of the game only allowed players to play as a generic human adventurer, versions 3.00 onward (released May 3, 2006) allow a choice of race among Human, Elf, Dwarf, Halfling or Half-Orc, and class of Adventurer, Warrior, Mage or Rogue. These choices affect the characters' starting attributes, as well as adding unique bonuses or penalties to the character that affect his progress through the game. Dungeon Levels become progressively more challenging as the player descends, with tougher monsters and traps. Most levels are randomly generated as the player reaches them, though there are certain pre-created levels as well, referred to as Legendary Lands. These areas are often tougher to survive than other levels, but also usually carry greater reward. Each new map begins obscured in darkness, though as the player explores, more and more of the map is revealed. As the character kills monsters and finds treasure, he is granted Experience Points which can allow progression to higher Character Levels. With each new Character Level attained, the player is allowed to increase one personal statistic among Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence or Health. In this way, the player hopes to become tougher, to survive each progressive level. Treasure may also sometimes be used to purchase better equipment and spells (or these can be found lying around in the dungeon), and sometimes paths to other maps at the same Dungeon Level or even an earlier one can be found. Eventually the character will either be killed, in which case the game ends in defeat, and a high score is generated and added to a list, or the player will encounter and kill Xaskazien on Dungeon Level 30, and win the game (and generate a correspondingly higher score). In addition to monsters and traps, players can encounter any number fixtures (like fountains, chests, coffins, magic archways) and friendly characters (like damsels, knights, weapon merchants or clerics). Interacting with these can help or hinder the player's progress in a variety of ways. The mouse can be used to query monsters and squares to learn more about the risks and potential gains associated with each.

He traveled the world, including over 20 years in the Hawaiian islands. In 1850, Hillebrand lived at what is now Foster Botanical Garden in Honolulu. He also became known as a botanist. Life and career Hillebrand was born on November 13, 1821 in Nieheim, Province of Westphalia, Prussia. His father was Judge Franz Josef Hillebrand, and mother Louise Pauline Konig. He studied medicine at Heidelberg and Berlin, and practiced at Paderborn. He sought a warmer climate to recover from a lung problem, (perhaps tuberculosis), first traveling to Australia in 1849, and then the Philippines. Hillebrand then went to San Francisco and finally arrived in the Hawaii December 22, 1850. He stayed for a little over 20 years and made significant contributions that endure to this day. He was able to speak the Hawaiian language as well as German, English, Latin, and French. He went into practice with Dr. Wesley Newcomb, and married his stepdaughter Anna Post on November 16, 1852. In 1853, Hillebrand purchased of land from Queen Kalama, just a short distance from where he worked. He had a keen interest in plants, and over the years, planted a number of exotic and native trees in his garden. Six years after his arrival, he and nine other Honolulu physicians petitioned to charter an organization called the Hawaiian Medical Society. Two months later, the petition was granted. Today, it is the Hawaii Medical Association. After the death of Thomas Charles Byde Rooke in 1858, he was appointed physician to the royal family of King Kamehameha IV. Hillebrand also served as chief (and only) physician at The Queen's Hospital (now The Queen's Medical Center), from 1860 to 1871. The hospital was named after Queen Emma, Dr. Rooke's adoptive daughter who was Kamehameha IV's wife. In 1865 he was appointed to the King's Privy Council, the Board of Health, and Bureau of Immigration. In April 1865 Hillebrand traveled to Asia and the East Indies on behalf of the Hawaiian government. He had three main goals: to find sources of labor for the sugarcane plantations, to learn about the latest treatments for leprosy, and to collect and import plants and animals that would be useful to the Islands. Hillebrand wrote an article on leprosy that was published in 1883. Another European immigrant to Hawaii, Joseph Francis Charles Rock (1884‚Äì1962) would continue Hillebrand's work of identifying Hawaiian species. Hillebrand moved back to Germany in 1871. In 1877 he arranged for the first immigrants from Portugal to come to Hawaii as plantation workers. For nearly a decade he considered returning to Hawaii. In 1880, he determined that would never happen, so sold his home to shipping entrepreneur Captain Thomas Foster and his wife Mary, who lived on an adjacent lot. Years later, Mary Foster bequeathed the land to the city, which opened it to the public as Foster Botanical Garden in 1930. He died July 13, 1886 in Heidelberg. He is the father of William Francis Hillebrand (1853‚Äì1925), an American chemist. Awards and honors * Two plants, Veronica hillebrandii and Phebalium hillebrandii are named in his honor.

Founded in 1891,Yahoo finance profile Hecla Mining was prominent in what became known as the Silver Valley (Idaho), which had the second-largest deposits of silver in the country. In 1983 this area was designated as a Superfund site by the Environmental Protection Agency, because of land, water and air contamination resulting from a century of mostly unregulated mining. History James Toner filed the Hecla claim on 5 May 1885. He passed on the claim to A.P. Horton, who sold it to George W. Hardesty and Simon Healey. Patrick (Patsy) Clark owned the claim outright by 1 July 1891. On 29 Sept. 1891, Clark formed the Hecla Mining Company with Albert Gross and Charles Kipp. On 14 Oct. 1891, the company was incorporated in Idaho by Clark, Charles Kipp, John A. Finch, Amasa B. (Mace) Campbell, John Dorsey, Healey and Hardesty, and 500,000 shares issued. By 1897, the mine had three tunnels and a 150 foot winze. On 12 July 1899, the new Hecla Mining Company was incorporated in Washington by Campbell, Finch and Clark. The company was capitalized with 1,000,000 shares, surrounding claims were acquired, and Edward F. Moffitt made manager. The Hecla tunnel was rebuilt in 1900, and the company paid its first dividend on 25 July 1900. Ore was sent to Salida, Colorado for processing by American Metal Company's Ohio & Colorado Smelting & Refining Company. James F. McCarthy took over management in 1903, James R. Smith was elected president, and the company bought the Milwaukee mill located in Gem. In 1913, Hecla started sending ore to International Smelting and Refining Company in Tooele, Utah. Hecla Mining moved offices from Spokane, Washington, to Wallace, Idaho, on 14 Oct. 1904. In Oct. 1908, Frank Upman was elected president, he was succeeded by McCarthy in Oct. 1911, and the east ore body was discovered in Feb. 1912. On 23 Sept. 1915, Hecla stock was listed on the New York Curb Exchange, and monthly dividends paid since March 1904, became quarterly in 1918. In July 1917, Hecla began sending its ore to the Bunker Hill Mine and Smelting Complex in Kellogg, Idaho, and by 1918, the Hecla mine shaft was reaching 2000 feet in depth. In 1920, Hecla acquired Federal Mining & Smelting Co.'s claims near Hecla, including the Tiger-Poorman. The Bunker Hill Mining Company constructed an electrolytic zinc plant after purchasing the Star Mine in Burke. Bunker Hill formed an equal partnership with Hecla Mining to develop the Star Ore and develop the zinc plant, calling the company the Sullivan Mining Company. The Star ore was accessed and mined from an almost 8000 foot tunnel from the lower workings of Hecla Mine. The tunnel was started in 1921, and the zinc plant was operational by Oct. 1928, and used Dr. U.C. Tainton's process. The Tainton process used sulphuric acid to combine with the zinc, forming a sulphate solution, followed by electrolysis tp remove the zinc. The product was called Bunker Hill 99.9 percent zinc. The 13 July 1923 fire burned most of Burke's business district, including Hecla's surface plant, putting the mine out of business for almost 6 months. Use and Occupancy Insurance covered the loss, and Hecla rebuilt the plant with concrete and steel. In 1924, ore was found in the Star, and a substantial ore body was discovered in the Hecla at the 2800 foot level. A tunnel then connected the Star with the Morning mine at the 2250 foot level. In 1925, a tailings mill started operation next to the Gem mill, and continued operation until 1949. The main Hecla shaft was deepened to the 3500 foot level by 1929. In 1930, Hecla gained control of the Polaris Mine. In 1933, Hecla started developing the Polaris mine with a shaft, while buying the surrounding property, which included the Chester in 1936, and Silver Summit in 1935. The Silver Summit tunnel was then extended to the Polaris shaft. The Polaris Development & Mining Company included 10 percent ownership by Newmont Mining Corporation in 1934, and Newmont's exploration geologist, Fred Searls, joined the Hecla board. Lewis E. Hanley served as president starting in 1940, until 1951. Hecla started a tailings mill at Osburn, that processed 4,000,000 tons of Canyon Creek tailings over the next 5 years. The last tonnage of ore hoisted from the Hecla Mine was on 31 July 1944, bringing the total to 9,050,977 tons. The Hecla Mine stayed open at the 2000 foot level, so the Star could operate. The Silver Summit shaft was deepened to 3000 feet, where additional ore was discovered in 1946. By 1948, Hecla owned 50% of Sullivan, 63% of Polaris (now merged with Silver Summit), and 33% of the Resurrection Mining Co., located east of Leadville, Colorado. Lester Randall became president in 1951, and served until 1966, when William H. Love took over. Randall worked on consolidating Hecla's balance sheet, selling its interest in Sullivan to Bunker Hill in exchange for stock, becoming the largest shareholder at 17.37% in 1955. Hecla was paid a fee and rental for Star access, until 1961, when it took a 30% interest in production. Hecla also sold off the Pend Oreille Lead Zinc Co. stock it had bought in 1945, while relinquishing Rock Creek claims, located southeast of Wallace, it acquired in 1946. In 1958, Hecla started purchasing shares in Lucky Friday Silver-Lead Mines, eventually becoming the major owner at 38%. In 1964, Lucky Friday Silver-Lead Mines Co. merged into Hecla Mining. On 21 Dec. 1964, shares of Hecla Mining started trading on the New York Stock Exchange, after 49 years on the American Stock Exchange. In 1966, Hecla acquired the Morning Mine from Asarco. The Morning Mine had been operating since 1889, when it was closed in 1953. Hecla had reached an agreement in 1961 to develop the Morning through the Star. Hecla established the Hecla corridor connecting Burke with Mullan, and developed a central shaft to deepen the mine to the 9100 foot level. In 1967, Hecla purchased 14% of Day Mines, Inc., becoming the largest stockholder, and reached an agreement to develop the Hunter Ranch through the Lucky Friday shaft. William A. Griffith took over as president in 1979, and Hecla decided to sink a third shaft, \\"the Silver Shaft\\", at Lucky Friday, taking it to 6205 feet by 1983. On 8 July 1981, Hecla and Day Mines agreed to merge. Hecla thus acquired the Knob Hill gold mine near Republic, Washington, besides owning all of the Lucky Friday. In 1982, Hecla shut down operations at the Star-Morning. On 7 June 1983, Hecla incorporated in Delaware. On 9 March 1984, Hecla merged with Ranchers Exploration and Development Corp., and Hecla acquired the Escalante silver mine west of Cedar City, Utah, the Kentucky- Tennessee Clay Co., and the Colorado Aggregate Co. In 1986, Hecla opened its new corporate office north of Coeur d'Alene and Arthur Brown became president. In June 2011 Hecla Mining settled an environmental suit under the Superfund statute, filed under CERCLA in 1991 by the Coeur d'Alene Tribe, which was later entered by the United States and the state of Idaho. Under the settlement agreement, Hecla Mining will pay $263.4 million plus interest to the plaintiffs > \\"to resolve claims stemming from releases of wastes from its mining > operations.

Engine development problems prevented it from taking part. Development In 1923 the Royal Aero Club (RAeC) organised what became known as the Lympne light aircraft trials after the airfield where they were based, though the RAeC referred to the competing aircraft as motor- gliders. The intention was to develop economical private aviation, so the engine size was limited to 750 cc with immediate consequences for aircraft size and weight. Various sponsors provided attractive prizes, particularly the total of ¬£1500 jointly from the Duke of Sutherland and the Daily Mail. The event took place from 8‚Äì13 October 1923. The Gannet was Gloster's intended entry. It was a small, single-bay biplane, one of the smallest aircraft built in Britain. It was powered by a specially designed Carden vertical two- cylinder air-cooled two-stroke engine of exactly 750 cc.Flight 4 October 1923 The thick wings were based on a pair of spruce I-section spars with spruce ribs and internal wire bracing. The inner section and interplane struts were of streamlined steel tube; ailerons were carried on upper and lower wings. The Lympne aircraft were aimed at the private owner, for whom transport and storage might be an important issue, so the Gannet's wings were hinged at the rear spar so they could be folded back along the fuselage. Both wing centre section trailing edges folded to permit the wing-folding; the upper section was also folded up to aid access to the cockpit. The 2 imp. gallon (9.1 litre) fuel tank was in the upper centre section. The fuselage was constructed around ash longerons, with plywood sides and fabric top and bottom. The undercarriage was joined to the centre section via a V-shaped pair of struts, had a single axle and, initially very small wheels. Unfortunately for Gloster, the Carden engine had not had time for proper development and overheating and lubrication problems prevented the Gannet from flying at Lympne, though it was present, registered as G-EBHU and bearing Trials number 7. The photographic evidenceFlight 18 October 1923 p.639 shows it was either flying or making fast ground runs by then, though James gives the first flight date as either 23 October or 23 November.James gives the October date in text p.95 but the same day in November on p.350. Both dates are after the Trials, though he says \\"did not take part\\" on p.95 but \\"flew [in the competition]\\" on p.350 The following year the Gannet was re-engined with a 7 hp (5.2 kW) Blackburne Tomtit inverted V-twin. It was also fitted with larger diameter wheels. It seems to have remained airworthy until permanently withdrawn from use on 25 January 1928, but Gloster did not enter it into the two other Lympne light aircraft trials held in 1924 and 1926. It appeared at the Olympia Aero show in 1929 and went for scrap in 1932.

HistoryEarly tensions: 1949‚Äì64= Banias waterfall, Golan Heights Flood waters exiting from the Yarmuk reservoir to the Yarmuk river, 1933 Lake Kinneret, Israel The 1949 Armistice Agreements which followed the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War, created three demilitarized zones on the Israel-Syria border. The southernmost, and also the largest, stretched from the south- eastern part of the Sea of Galilee eastwards to the Yarmuk River where the borders of Israel, Jordan and Syria converge. The issue of water sharing from the Jordan‚ÄìYarmuk system turned out to be a major problem between Israel, Syria and Jordan. Small scale water-related skirmishes had occurred following the 1949 agreements. In July 1953, Israel began construction of an intake for its National Water Carrier at the Daughters of Jacob Jordan Bridge in the demilitarized zone north of the Sea of Galilee. Syrian artillery units opened fire on the construction site. The United Nations security council majority (excepting the USSR) voted for the resumption of work by Israel. The Israelis then moved the intake to an economically inferior site at the Sea of Galilee. In 1955 the Jordan Valley Unified Water Plan (Johnston Plan) was accepted by the technical committees of both Israel and the Arab League, but the Arab League Council decided not to ratify the plan on 11 October 1955. According to most observers, including Johnston himself, the Arab non-adoption of the plan was not total rejection. While they failed to approve it politically, they nevertheless seemed determined to adhere to the technical details of the agreement. Moreover, it continued to be taken seriously by Arab leaders. Though the Unified Plan failed to be ratified, both Jordan and Israel undertook to operate within their allocation limits. =Main phase: 1964‚Äì67= Israel completed its National Water Carrier project, which siphoned water from the Sea of Galilee in 1964. The initial diversion capacity of the National Water Carrier, without supplementary booster pumps, was 320 million m3, well within the limits of the Johnston Plan.200px Nevertheless, the Arab states were not prepared to coexist with a project which seemed likely to make a major contribution to Israel's economic growth. In January 1964 an Arab League summit meeting convened in Cairo and decided: > The establishment of Israel is the basic threat that the Arab nation in its > entirety has agreed to forestall. And since the existence of Israel is a > danger that threatens the Arab nation, the diversion of the Jordan waters by > it multiplies the dangers to Arab existence. Accordingly, the Arab states > have to prepare the plans necessary for dealing with the political, economic > and social aspects, so that if necessary results are not achieved, > collective Arab military preparations, when they are not completed, will > constitute the ultimate practical means for the final liquidation of Israel. The Arab states decided to deprive Israel of 35% of the National Water Carrier capacity, by a diversion of the Jordan River headwaters (both the Hasbani and the Banias) to the Yarmouk River. The scheme was only marginally feasible, as it was technically difficult and expensive. A major escalation took place in 1964 when Israel declared it would regard the Diversion Project as an infringement on its sovereign rights. In 1965, there were three notable border clashes, starting with Syrian shootings of Israeli farmers and army patrols, followed by Israeli tanks and artillery destroying the Arab heavy earth moving machines that were used for the diversion plan. The Arab countries eventually abandoned their project. Control of water resources and Israeli military attacks against the diversion effort are considered among the factors which led to the Six-Day War in June 1967. The war is referenced in the famous US antiwar 1965 song \\"Eve of Destruction\\" by Barry McGuire with the line \\"And even the Jordan River has bodies floatin'\\".http://www.metrolyrics.com/eve-of- destruction-lyrics-barry-mcguire.html See also *Headwater Diversion Plan (Jordan River) *Water politics in the Middle East NotesFurther reading   Category:Conflicts in 1964 Category:Conflicts in 1965 Category:Conflicts in 1966 Category:Conflicts in 1967 Category:Israel‚ÄìSyria military relations Category:Water resource conflicts Category:Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict Category:Water in Syria Category:Water in Israel Category:Golan Heights ","title":"War over Water (Jordan river)"},{"id":"21689412","text":"This is a list of settlements in Croatian Baranja sorted alphabetically by city and municipality with their respective populations.

In graph theory, an edge dominating set for a graph G = (V, E) is a subset D ‚äÜ E such that every edge not in D is adjacent to at least one edge in D. An edge dominating set is also known as a line dominating set. Figures (a)‚Äì(d) are examples of edge dominating sets (thick red lines). A minimum edge dominating set is a smallest edge dominating set. Figures (a) and (b) are examples of minimum edge dominating sets (it can be checked that there is no edge dominating set of size 2 for this graph).  Properties  An edge dominating set for G is a dominating set for its line graph L(G) and vice versa. Any maximal matching is always an edge dominating set. Figures (b) and (d) are examples of maximal matchings. Furthermore, the size of a minimum edge dominating set equals the size of a minimum maximal matching. A minimum maximal matching is a minimum edge dominating set; Figure (b) is an example of a minimum maximal matching. A minimum edge dominating set is not necessarily a minimum maximal matching, as illustrated in Figure (a); however, given a minimum edge dominating set D, it is easy to find a minimum maximal matching with D edges (see, e.g., ).  Algorithms and computational complexity  Determining whether there is an edge dominating set of a given size for a given graph is an NP-complete problem (and therefore finding a minimum edge dominating set is an NP-hard problem). show that the problem is NP-complete even in the case of a bipartite graph with maximum degree 3, and also in the case of a planar graph with maximum degree 3. There is a simple polynomial-time approximation algorithm with approximation factor 2: find any maximal matching. A maximal matching is an edge dominating set; furthermore, a maximal matching M can be at worst 2 times as large as a smallest maximal matching, and a smallest maximal matching has the same size as the smallest edge dominating set. Also the edge-weighted version of the problem can be approximated within factor 2, but the algorithm is considerably more complicated (; ). show that finding a better than (7/6)-approximation is NP- hard.

Occupational fatalities are also commonly called ‚Äúoccupational deaths‚Äù or ‚Äúwork-related deaths/fatalities‚Äù and can occur in any industry or occupation. Common causes Common causes of occupational fatalities include falls, machine-related incidents, motor vehicle accidents, electrocution, falling objects, homicides and suicides. Oftentimes, occupational fatalities can be prevented. In the United States in 2007, 42% of occupational fatalities occurred during a transportation incident, 16% occurred after a worker came into contact with an object or equipment, 15% occurred as a result of a fall, 15% occurred as a result of assault or other violent acts in the workplace, 12% were the result of chemical or environmental exposures (9%) and 3% were the result of fires or explosions. {  Number and rate of fatal occupational injuries, by industry sector, 2013 in the United States. Selected occupations with high fatality rates, 2011, in the United States. } Incidence Data on the number of occupational fatalities per 100,000 workers is available from the International Labor Organization for various countries; the ILO says for most countries the rate is less than ten per 100,000 each year. However, a 1999 paper says the ILO figures are underestimates -- for example the agricultural sector, which has a higher than average fatality rate, is not reported by many countries. The paper estimates that the number of fatal occupational accidents in the world in 1994 was 335,000, or 14 per 100,000 workers. The paper also estimated there were 158,000 fatalities commuting between work and home; and 325,000 fatal occupational diseases; for a total of 818,000 fatalities.Jukka Takala, 1999. \\"Global Estimates of Fatal Occupational Accidents\\", Epidemiology, Vol. 10 No. 5 (September)  Prevention  Occupational fatalities are preventable. Prevention of occupational fatalities depends on the understanding that worker safety is not only the responsibility of the worker, but is the primary responsibility of the employer. Employers must train all employees in the appropriate safety procedures and maintain a safe working environment so that fatalities are less likely to occur. An occupational fatality is not just the fault of the deceased worker; instead, it is the combination of unsafe work environments, insufficient safety training, and negligible employee supervision that contribute fatal incidents. As a result, it is imperative that an employer address all the potential [risk] factors at the workplace and educate all employees in safe work practices and risk awareness. In order to perform adequate risk assessment of injuries that occur in the workplace, health and safety professionals use resources such as the Haddon Matrix. This model assesses the risks leading up to, during, and after a death in order to prevent future incidents of a similar nature. Employers and employees can learn how to identify risk factors in their work environment in order to avoid incidents that may result in death.  Research, regulation, reporting and recommendations United States= In the United States, the regulatory organization for occupational injury control and prevention is the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). Formed in 1970 as an agency of the United States Department of Labor under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, OSHA exists to prevent occupational injuries and deaths by creating and enforcing standards in the workplace. OSHA standards address employee training programs, safety equipment, employer record keeping and proper maintenance of the work environment. Failure to comply with the OSHA standards can result in workplace inspections and legal action including citations and fines. In very severe cases of employer misconduct, OSHA can ‚Äúred flag‚Äù an operation and send the employer to legal court. To regulate the millions of workplaces in the United States, OSHA requires that all employers maintain a record of occupational injuries, illnesses and fatalities. Occupational fatalities must be reported to OSHA within eight hours of the incident. Failure to do so can result in legal action against the employer. Employers are responsible for staying current on OSHA standards and enforcing them in their own workplace. State OSHA organizations exist in twenty-eight states and are required to have the same or more rigorous standards than the federal OSHA standards. In these states, employers must abide by their state's regulations. It is not the responsibility of the employee to stay current on the OSHA standards. In addition to OSHA, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) was formed under the Occupational Safety and Health Act as a federal research agency to formulate industry recommendations for health and safety. NIOSH is part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). NIOSH analyzes workplace injury and illness data from all fifty states as well as provides support for state-based projects in occupational health and safety. Under NIOSH, the Fatality Assessment and Control Evaluation (FACE) Program tracks and investigates occupational fatalities in order to provide recommendations for prevention. A voluntary program for individual states created in 1989, FACE is active in California, Iowa, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, and Washington. The primary responsibilities of the state FACE programs are to track occupational fatalities in their state, investigate select fatalities, and provide recommendations for prevention. As part of the prevention efforts, FACE programs also produce extensive prevention education materials that are disseminated to employees, employers, unions, and state organizations. Nationally, the Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries (CFOI), within the U.S. Department of Labor, compiles national fatality statistics. CFOI is the key, comprehensive system in the surveillance of occupational fatalities in the United States. Many other non-governmental organizations also work to prevent occupational fatalities. Trade associations and unions play an active role in protecting workers and disseminating prevention information. The National Safety Council also works to prevent occupational fatalities as well as provide resources to employers and employees.

Valency refers to how many and what kinds of arguments a predicate licenses‚Äîi.e. what arguments the predicate selects grammatically. Avalent verbs are verbs which have no valency, meaning that they have no logical arguments, such as subject or object. Languages known as pro-drop or null- subject languages do not require clauses to have an overt subject when the subject is easily inferred, meaning that a verb can appear alone. However, non-null-subject languages such as English require a pronounced subject in order for a sentence to be grammatical. This means that the avalency of a verb is not readily apparent, because, despite the fact that avalent verbs lack arguments, the verb nevertheless has a subject. According to some, avalent verbs may have an inserted subject (often a pronoun such as it or there), which is syntactically required, yet semantically meaningless, making no reference to anything that exists in the real world. An inserted subject is referred to as a pleonastic, or expletive it (also called a dummy pronoun). Because it is semantically meaningless, pleonastic it is not considered a true argument, meaning that a verb with this it as the subject is truly avalent. However, others believe that it represents a quasi-argument, having no real- world referent, but retaining certain syntactic abilities. Still others consider it to be a true argument, meaning that it is referential, and not merely a syntactic placeholder. There is no general consensus on how it should be analyzed under such circumstances, but determining the status of it as a non-argument, a quasi-argument, or a true argument, will help linguists to understand what verbs, if any, are truly avalent. A common example of such verbs in many languages is the set of verbs describing weather. In providing examples for the avalent verbs below, this article must assume the analysis of pleonastic it, but will delve into the other two analyses following the examples.  Examples of avalent verbs  Figure 1. Syntax phrase structure tree. This English sentence reads, \\"It rains.\\" N.B. The angled brackets around \\"rain\\" indicate syntactic movement. The tree was creating using phpSyntaxTree. = Avalent verbs in non-null-subject languages = In non-null-subject languages (also referred to as languages which are not pro-drop languages) avalent verbs typically still have a subject. The subject, however, is not truly an actant (or, agent), but rather simply a marker of third person singular. The following examples have been taken from Lucien Tesni√®re's Elements of Structural Syntax. * Examples in English: # It rains. (See Figure 1.) # It is snowing. * Examples in French: # Il pleut. Meaning, \\"It rains,\\" or \\"It is raining.\\" # Il neige. Meaning, \\"It snows,\\" or \\"It is snowing.\\" * Examples in German: # Es regnet. Meaning, \\"It rains,\\" or \\"It is raining.\\" # Es ist kalt. Meaning, \\"It is cold.\\" In all of the above examples, the pronoun corresponding to English it (in French, il; in German es) does not point to a specific entity in the real world: it is neither a person, nor a \\"thing capable of participating in any way in the process of raining.\\" (Although, as an interesting aside, Tesni√®re mentions that some believe avalent verbs began as monovalent verbs, where the subject referred to some divine being who was causing the weather. For example, in the Greek sentence, ·ΩçŒºŒ∑œÅŒøœÇ ·ΩëœÄŒ≠ŒªŒ±Œ≤ŒµŒΩ . . . ·ΩóœÉŒ±Œπ œÑ·Ω∏ŒΩ ŒîŒØŒ±, meaning \\"Homer believed that Zeus was raining\\".) Tesni√®re states that the third person marker does not tell the listener/reader anything about the subject, because there is no concept of an actant (or agent) attached to it. Figure 1 shows a phrase structure tree of the English sentence It rains. While it does not appear to contribute any meaning to the sentence, it is still syntactically required to be present. For example, an English speaker cannot simply say, Rains, because attempting to pronounce the sentence without the pleonastic it renders the sentence ungrammatical. This ungrammatical instance arises from a violation of the Extended Projection Principle (EPP) which states that all tensed phrases must have a subject. In Figure 1, it occupies the subject (or, specifier) position of the tense phrase (TP), satisfying the EPP, and making the sentence It rains grammatical. = Avalent verbs in null-subject languages = Avalency is more clearly demonstrated in pro-drop languages, which do not grammatically require a dummy pronoun as English does. * Examples in Latin: # Pluit. Meaning, \\"It rains,\\" or \\"It is raining.\\" # Ningit. Meaning, \\"It snows,\\" or \\"It is snowing.\\"Figure 2. Syntax phrase structure tree. This Latin sentence reads, \\"Pluit,\\" which means \\"It rains\\" or \\"It is raining,\\" in English. The angled brackets indicate syntactic movement. The tree was creating using phpSyntaxTree. * Examples in Italian: # Piove. Meaning, \\"It rains,\\" or \\"It is raining.\\" # Nevica. Meaning, \\"It snows,\\" or \\"It is snowing.\\" * Examples in Spanish: # llueve. Meaning, \\"It rains,\\" or \\"It is raining.\\" # Nieva. Meaning, \\"It snows,\\" or \\"It is snowing.\\" Because none of the above examples have an overt, pronounced subject, they all appear to violate the EPP. However, null-subject languages allow phrases without an overt subject if the subject can easily be deduced by the context. Highly inflected languages, such as the above null-subject languages, may not need to insert expletive it the way that non-null-subject languages do. The determiner phrase (DP) in Figure 2 is not overtly filled, hence it is marked with an e (empty) indicating that has no phonological content. This is allowed in null- subject languages because \\"overt agreement morphology licenses null subjects.\\" This means that a morphologically rich language, such as Latin, uses inflections to indicate things such as, person and number (in the case of verbs), and so does not need to use a semantically void pronoun. For example, in the phrase in Figure 2, Pluit, the ending -t indicates that the verb is third person singular, thereby making the addition of a pronoun unnecessary.  Analyses of avalent verbs  Although in English these verbs do have what seems to be a subject, it, it is arguably devoid of semantic meaning and merely a syntactic placeholder. For Tesni√®re, the it in the English sentence It rains, is merely an instance of expletive it insertion. Differing views of this use of it do exist, however, making it potentially a quasi-argument or simply a normal subject. Determining whether or not it counts as an argument will help to explain what verbs, if any, are truly avalent. = Chomsky's \\"weather it\\" analysis = Figure 3. Syntax phrase structure tree using Chomsky's example sentence. This English sentence reads, \\"It sometimes rains after snowing.\\" N.B. The angled brackets around green-coloured \\"it\\" and \\"rain\\" indicate syntactic movement. The tree was creating using phpSyntaxTree. Noam Chomsky identifies two types of arguments, \\"true arguments\\" and \\"quasi- arguments\\". True arguments have the capacity to be referential, as in the example it is on the table. Here, the pronoun it is referential, that is, it refers back to something that exists in the real world. Quasi-arguments, on the other hand, are not true arguments in the sense that they do not possess referential qualities, but do behave like arguments in the sense that they can control PRO. Chomsky claims that \\"weather it\\" is a quasi-argument, as in the phrase It sometimes rains after [Œ± snowing], where Œ± represents PRO, which is controlled by weather it (see Figure 3). PRO typically takes on the \\"referential properties of its antecedent\\", but in this case the antecedent, weather it, is not referential. Conversely, he also identifies \\"non-arguments\\" which are not meaningful semantically, but do provide a syntactic function. In the phrase it seems that John is here, it is what Chomsky refers to as \\"pleonastic it,\\" which is neither referential, nor does it ever govern PRO. (N.B. In the above example, while \\"seems\\" requires the insertion of pleonastic it, it cannot be truly be described as a verb of zero valence, because it takes the clause that John is here as its complement.) In English, if there is no meaningful subject, a pleonastic (such as it) must be inserted into the subject position in order to satisfy the Extended Projection Principle (EPP) which states that a tensed clause requires a subject. For Chomsky, \\"weather it\\" is neither a pleonastic, nor is it a true argument, it is a quasi- argument. = Bolinger's \\"ambient it\\" analysis = Dwight Bolinger posits that it is not simply a pleonastic, rather, it is a meaningful unit that is in fact referential. For Bolinger, the syntax trees in Figures 1, 2, and 3 would look the same structurally, but the difference would be that it is fully referential. It has as its referent the \\"environment that is central to the whole idea\\" of what is being discussed. He believes that it takes on the most general possible referent, and that its referent is usually unexpressed because it is meant to be obvious to the listener/hearer based on context. For example, with regards to expressions of weather, the it in the phrase It is hot, is \\"ambient\\" and refers to the general environment. The listener will correctly interpret it to be referring to the environment in which the speakers find themselves. In order to demonstrate that this general use of it is referential, he provides the following pair of questions and answers: # How is it in your room? It's hard to study. # How is it in your room? *To study is hard. (N.B.The asterisk is a symbol meaning that the content following it is unattested/ungrammatical.) These examples demonstrate that, in this context, the occurrence of it in the first sentence is not simply an instance of extraposition (also called cleft construction), but refers back to the same it present in the question. The fact that the answer in the second set is unattested exemplifies the fact that the first is not a matter of extraposition. The phrase To study is hard is not ungrammatical in all contexts, but the fact that it is ungrammatical in this context shows that in order to answer the question How is it in your room? the person responding must make use of it in order for their answer to be grammatical. Therefore, according to Bolinger, it is neither a pleonastic, nor a quasi-argument, but a \\"nominal with the greatest possible generality of meaning,\\" and says that it is incorrect to \\"confuse generality of meaning with lack of meaning.\\" Under Bolinger's analysis of it, verbs like the above examples are not avalent, but monovalent, taking the true argument it as their subject.

Market design is the flip side of that coin: given a set of agents, market design seeks to identify the game rules a market designer might implement that would produce the desired behaviors in the players. In some markets, prices may be used to induce the desired outcomes‚Äîthese markets are the study of auction theory. In other markets, prices may not be used‚Äîthese markets are the study of matching theory. In his 2008, Nemmers Prize lecture, Market Design and Stanford University economist Paul Milgrom commented on the interdisciplinary nature of market design: \\"Market design is a kind of economic engineering, utilizing laboratory research, game theory, algorithms, simulations, and more. Its challenges inspire us to rethink longstanding fundamentals of economic theory.\\"Milgrom Nemmers Prize Presentation Slides, 2008 Milgrom is, along with fellow Stanford economist Al Roth, one of the founders of modern Market Design. Auction theory Early research on auctions focused on two special cases: common value auctions in which buyers have private signals of an items true value and private value auctions in which values are identically and independently distributed. Milgrom and Weber (1982) present a much more general theory of auctions with positively related values. Each of n buyers receives a private signal {{x}_{i}} . Buyer i‚Äôs value \\\\phi ({{x}_{i}},{{x}_{-i}}) is strictly increasing in {{x}_{i}} and is an increasing symmetric function of {{x}_{-i}}. If signals are independently and identically distributed, then buyer i‚Äôs expected value {{v}_{i}}={{E}_}\\\\\\\\{\\\\phi ({{x}_{i}},{{x}_{-i}})\\\\\\\\} is independent of the other buyers‚Äô signals. Thus, the buyers‚Äô expected values are independently and identically distributed. This is the standard private value auction. For such auctions the revenue equivalence theorem holds. That is, expected revenue is the same in the sealed first-price and second-price auctions. Milgrom and Weber assumed instead that the private signals are ‚Äúaffiliated‚Äù. With two buyers, the random variables {{v}_{1}} and {{v}_{2}} with probability density function f({{v}_{1}},{{v}_{2}}) are affiliated if : f({{v}_{1}}^{\\\\prime },{{v}_{2}}^{\\\\prime })f({{v}_{1}},{{v}_{2}})\\\\ge f({{v}_{1}},{{v}_{2}}^{\\\\prime })f({{v}_{1}}^{\\\\prime },{{v}_{2}}), for all v and all {v}'. Applying Bayes‚Äô Rule it follows that f({{v}_{2}}^{\\\\prime }{{v}_{1}}^{\\\\prime })f({{v}_{2}}{{v}_{1}})\\\\ge f({{v}_{2}}{{v}_{1}}^{\\\\prime })f({{v}_{2}}^{\\\\prime }{{v}_{1}}), for all v and all {v}'. Rearranging this inequality and integrating with respect to {{v}_{2}}^{\\\\prime } it follows that :\\\\frac{F({{v}_{2}}{{v}_{1}}^{\\\\prime })}{f({{v}_{2}}{{v}_{1}}^{\\\\prime })}\\\\ge \\\\frac{F({{v}_{2}}{{v}_{1}})}{f({{v}_{2}}{{v}_{1}})}, for all {{v}_{2}} and all{{v}_{1}}^{\\\\prime }<{{v}_{1}}. (1) It is this implication of affiliation that is critical in the discussion below. For more than two symmetrically distributed random variables, let V=\\\\\\\\{{{v}_{1}},...,{{v}_{n}}\\\\\\\\} be a set of random variables that are continuously distributed with joint probability density function f(v) . The n random variables are affiliated if : f({x}',{y}')f(x,y)\\\\ge f(x,{y}')f({x}',y) for all (x,y) and ({x}',{y}') in X\\\\times Y where ({x}',{y}')<(x,y). Revenue Ranking Theorem (Milgrom and WeberMilgrom, Paul and Robert Weber (1982). \\"A Theory of Auctions and Competitive Bidding\\". Econometrica (Econometrica, Vol. 50, No. 5) 50 (5): 1089‚Äì1122) Suppose each of n buyers receives a private signal {{x}_{i}} . Buyer i‚Äôs value \\\\phi ({{x}_{i}},{{x}_{-i}}) is strictly increasing in {{x}_{i}} and is an increasing symmetric function of {{x}_{-i}}. If signals are affiliated, the equilibrium bid function in a sealed first-price auction {{b}_{i}}=B({{x}_{i}}) is smaller than the equilibrium expected payment in the sealed second price auction. The intuition for this result is as follows: In the sealed second-price auction the expected payment of a winning bidder with value v is based on their own information. By the revenue equivalence theorem if all buyers had the same beliefs, there would be revenue equivalence. However, if values are affiliated, a buyer with value v knows that buyers with lower values have more pessimistic beliefs about the distribution of values. In the sealed high-bid auction such low value buyers therefore bid lower than they would if they had the same beliefs. Thus the buyer with value v does not have to compete so hard and bids lower as well. Thus the informational effect lowers the equilibrium payment of the winning bidder in the sealed first-price auction. Equilibrium bidding in the sealed first- and second-price auctions: We consider here the simplest case in which there are two buyers and each buyer‚Äôs value {{v}_{i}}=\\\\phi ({{x}_{i}}) depends only on his own signal. Then the buyers‚Äô values are private and affiliated. In the sealed second-price (or Vickrey auction), it is a dominant strategy for each buyer to bid his value. If both buyers do so, then a buyer with value v has an expected payment of : e(v)=\\\\frac{\\\\int\\\\limits_{0}^{v}yf(yv)dy}{F(vv)} (2) . In the sealed first- price auction, the increasing bid function B(v) is an equilibrium if bidding strategies are mutual best responses. That is, if buyer 1 has value v, their best response is to bid b = B(v) if they believes that their opponent is using this same bidding function. Suppose buyer 1 deviates and bids b = B(z) rather than B(v) . Let U(z) be their resulting payoff. For B(v) to be an equilibrium bid function, U(z) must take on its maximum at x = v. With a bid of b = B(z) buyer 1 wins if :B({{v}_{2}}) , that is, if {{v}_{2}} . The win probability is then w=F(zv) so that buyer 1's expected payoff is : U(z)=w(v-B(z))=F(zv)(v-B(z)). Taking logs and differentiating by z, : \\\\frac{{{U}^{\\\\prime }}(z)}{U(z)}=\\\\frac{{w}'(z)}{w(z)}-\\\\frac{{B}'(z)}{v-B(z)}=\\\\frac{f(zv)}{F(zv)}-\\\\frac{{B}'(z)}{v-B(z)}. (3) The first term on the right hand side is the proportional increase in the win probability as the buyer raises his bid from B(z) to B(z+\\\\Delta z). The second term is the proportional drop in the payoff if the buyer wins. We have argued that, for equilibrium, U(z) must take on its maximum at z = v . Substituting for z in (3) and setting the derivative equal to zero yields the following necessary condition. : {B}'(v)=\\\\frac{f(vv)}{F(vv)}(v-B(v)). (4) Proof of the revenue ranking theorem Buyer 1 with value x has conditional p.d.f. f({{v}_{2}}x). Suppose that he naively believes that all other buyers have the same beliefs. In the sealed high bid auction he computes the equilibrium bid function using these naive beliefs. Arguing as above, condition (3) becomes : \\\\frac{{{U}^{\\\\prime }}(z)}{U(z)}=\\\\frac{f(zx)}{F(zx)}-\\\\frac{{B}'(z)}{v-B(z)}. (3‚Äô) Since x > v it follows by affiliation (see condition (1)) that the proportional gain to bidding higher is bigger under the naive beliefs that place higher mass on higher values. Arguing as before, a necessary condition for equilibrium is that (3‚Äô) must be zero at x = v. Therefore, the equilibrium bid function {{B}_{x}}(v) satisfies the following differential equation. : {{B}_{x}}^{\\\\prime }(v)=\\\\frac{f(vx)}{F(vx)}(v-{{B}_{x}}(v)) . (5) Appealing to the revenue equivalence theorem, if all buyers have values that are independent draws from the same distribution then the expected payment of the winner is the same in the two auctions. Therefore, {{B}_{x}}(x)=e(x). Thus, to complete the proof we need to establish that B(x)\\\\le {{B}_{x}}(x). Appealing to (1), it follows from (4) and (5) that for all v < x. : {{B}_{x}}^{\\\\prime }(v)\\\\ge \\\\left(\\\\frac{v-{{B}_{x}}(v)}{v-B(v)}\\\\right)B(v) Therefore, for any v in the interval [0,x] :B(v)-{{B}_{x}}(v)>{{0}_}{{\\\\Rightarrow }_}{B}'(v)-{{B}_{x}}^{\\\\prime }(v)<0 . Suppose that B(x)>{{B}_{x}}(x). Since the equilibrium bid of a buyer with value 0 is zero, there must be some y < x such that : {{(i)}_}B(y)-{{B}_{x}}(y)={{0}_} and {{(ii)}_}B(v)-{{B}_{x}}(v)>0{{,}_}\\\\forall v\\\\in [y,x]. But this is impossible since we have just shown that over such an interval, B(v)-{{B}_{x}}(v) is decreasing. Since {{B}_{x}}(x)=e(x) it follows that the winner bidder's expected payment is lower in the sealed high-bid auction. Ascending auctions with package bidding Milgrom has also contributed to the understanding of combinatorial auctions. In work with Larry Ausubel (Ausubel and Milgrom, 2002), auctions of multiple items, which may be substitutes or complements, are considered. They define a mechanism, the ‚Äúascending proxy auction,‚Äù constructed as follows. Each bidder reports his values to a proxy agent for all packages that the bidder is interested in. Budget constraints can also be reported. The proxy agent then bids in an ascending auction with package bidding on behalf of the real bidder, iteratively submitting the allowable bid that, if accepted, would maximize the real bidder's profit (value minus price), based on the reported values. The auction is conducted with negligibly small bid increments. After each round, provisionally winning bids are determined that maximize the total revenue from feasible combinations of bids. All of a bidder's bids are kept live throughout the auction and are treated as mutually exclusive. The auction ends after a round occurs with no new bids. The ascending proxy auction may be viewed either as a compact representation of a dynamic combinatorial auction or as a practical direct mechanism, the first example of what Milgrom would later call a ‚Äúcore selecting auction.‚Äù They prove that, with respect to any reported set of values, the ascending proxy auction always generates a core outcome, i.e. an outcome that is feasible and unblocked. Moreover, if bidders‚Äô values satisfy the substitutes condition, then truthful bidding is a Nash equilibrium of the ascending proxy auction and yields the same outcome as the Vickrey‚ÄìClarke‚ÄìGroves (VCG) mechanism. However, the substitutes condition is robustly a necessary as well as a sufficient condition: if just one bidder's values violate the substitutes condition, then with appropriate choice of three other bidders with additively-separable values, the outcome of the VCG mechanism lies outside the core; and so the ascending proxy auction cannot coincide with the VCG mechanism and truthful bidding cannot be a Nash equilibrium. They also provide a complete characterization of substitutes preferences: Goods are substitutes if and only if the indirect utility function is submodular. Ausubel and Milgrom (2006a, 2006b) exposit and elaborate on these ideas. The first of these articles, entitled ‚ÄúThe Lovely but Lonely Vickrey Auction,‚Äù made an important point in market design. The VCG mechanism, while highly attractive in theory, suffers from a number of possible weaknesses when the substitutes condition is violated, making it a poor candidate for empirical applications. In particular, the VCG mechanism may exhibit: low (or zero) seller revenues; non-monotonicity of the seller's revenues in the set of bidders and the amounts bid; vulnerability to collusion by a coalition of losing bidders; and vulnerability to the use of multiple bidding identities by a single bidder. This may explain why the VCG auction design, while so lovely in theory, is so lonely in practice. Additional work in this area by Milgrom together with Larry Ausubel and Peter Cramton has been particularly influential in practical market design. Ausubel, Cramton and Milgrom (2006) together proposed a new auction format that is now called the ‚Äúcombinatorial clock auction‚Äù (CCA), which consists of a clock auction stage followed by a sealed-bid supplementary round. All of the bids are interpreted as package bids; and the final auction outcome is determined using a core selecting mechanism. The CCA was first used in the United Kingdom's 10‚Äì40 GHz spectrum auction of 2008. Since then, it has become a new standard for spectrum auctions: it has been utilized for major spectrum auctions in Austria, Denmark, Ireland, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the UK; and it is slated to be used in forthcoming auctions in Australia and Canada. At the 2008 Nemmers Prize conference, Penn State University economist Vijay KrishnaKrishna's Nemmers Presentation, 2008 and Larry AusubelAusubel's Nemmers Presentation, 2008 highlighted Milgrom's contributions to auction theory and their subsequent impact on auction design. Matching theory Milgrom has also contributed to the understanding of matching market design. In work with John Hatfield (Hatfield and Milgrom, 2005), he shows how to generalize the stable marriage matching problem to allow for ‚Äúmatching with contracts‚Äù, where the terms of the match between agents on either side of the market arise endogenously through the matching process. They show that a suitable generalization of the deferred acceptance algorithm of David Gale and Lloyd Shapley finds a stable matching in their setting; moreover, the set of stable matchings forms a lattice, and similar vacancy chain dynamics are present. The observation that stable matchings are a lattice was a well known result that provided the key to their insight into generalizing the matching model. They observed (as did some other contemporary authors) that the lattice of stable matchings was reminiscent of the conclusion of Tarski's fixed point theorem, which states that an increasing function from a complete lattice to itself has a nonempty set of fixed points that form a complete lattice. But it wasn't apparent what was the lattice, and what was the increasing function. Hatfield and Milgrom observed that the accumulated offers and rejections formed a lattice, and that the bidding process in an auction and the deferred acceptance algorithm were examples of a cumulative offer process that was an increasing function in this lattice. Their generalization also shows that certain package auctions (see also: Paul Milgrom: Policy) can be thought of as a special case of matching with contracts, where there is only one agent (the auctioneer) on one side of the market and contracts include both the items to be transferred and the total transfer price as terms. Thus, two of market design's great success stories, the deferred acceptance algorithm as applied to the medical match, and the simultaneous ascending auction as applied to the FCC spectrum auctions, have a deep mathematical connection. In addition, this work (in particular, the \\"cumulative offer\\" variation of the deferred acceptance algorithm) has formed the basis of recently proposed redesigns of the mechanisms used to match residents to hospitals in Japan and cadets to branches in the US Army. Simplifying participants‚Äô messages Milgrom has also contributed to the understanding of the effect of simplifying the message space in practical market design. He observed and developed as an important design element of many markets the notion of conflation‚Äîthe idea of restricting a participant's ability to convey rich preferences by forcing them to enter the same value for different preferences. An example of conflation arises in Gale and Shapley's deferred acceptance algorithm for hospital and doctors matching when hospitals are allowed to submit only responsive preferences (i.e., the ranking of doctors and capacities) even though they could be conceivably asked to submit general substitutes preferences. In the Internet sponsored-search auctions, advertisers are allowed to submit a single per-click bid, regardless of which ad positions they win. A similar, earlier idea of a conflated generic-item auction is an important component of the Combinatorial Clock Auction (Ausubel, Cramton and Milgrom, 2006), widely used in spectrum auctions including the UK's recent 800 MHz / 2.6 GHz auction, and has also been proposed for Incentive Auctions.FCC, Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 12-118, September 28, 2012. Bidders are allowed to express only the quantity of frequencies in the allocation stage of the auction without regard to the specific assignment (which is decided in a later assignment stage). Milgrom (2010) shows that with a certain ‚Äúoutcome closure property,‚Äù conflation adds no new unintended outcome as equilibrium and argued that, by thickening the markets, may intensify price competition and increase revenue. As a concrete application of the idea of simplifying messages, Milgrom (2009) defines assignment messages of preferences. In assignment messages, an agent can encode certain nonlinear preferences involving various substitution possibilities into linear objectives by allowing agents to describe multiple ‚Äúroles‚Äù that objects can play in generating utility, with utility thus generated being added up. The valuation over a set of objects is the maximum value that can be achieved by optimally assigning them to various roles. Assignment messages can also be applied to resource allocation without money; see, for example, the problem of course allocation in schools, as analyzed by Budish, Che, Kojima, and Milgrom (2013). In doing so, the paper has provided a generalization of the Birkhoff- von Neumann Theorem (a mathematical property about Doubly Stochastic Matrices) and applied it to analyze when a given random assignment can be \\"implemented\\" as a lottery over feasible deterministic outcomes. A more general language, endowed assignment message, is studied by Hatfield and Milgrom (2005). Milgrom provides an overview of these issues in Milgrom (2011).

The estimates of the number of Argentines of Russian descent vary between 170,000 and 350,000. They are mostly living in Buenos Aires and Greater Buenos Aires. Most Russian immigrants arrived in Argentina between 1880 and 1921, while a smaller number arrived in the 1990s. Russian movement into Argentina can be divided into five waves of immigration, the last three consisting of actual ethnic Russians, while the first one consists of immigrants categorized as \\"Russian\\" due to their origin in the Russian Empire even though a substantial number were not in fact ethnic Russians (but included substantial numbers of Volga Germans and Jews).  Immigration history  During the late 19th century and early 20th century, a variety of groups from the Russian Empire emigrated to Argentina. From 1901 to 1920, Russia was the third most common country of origin for immigrants in Argentina. By ethnicity, the immigrants primarily consisted of Jews and Volga Germans, but also included Poles, Finns, and Ukrainians. By 1910, Argentina's population included 45,000 Germans. In the last 80 years, many of the immigrants to Argentina have been Slavs: Bulgarians, Serbians, and Montenegrins, often looking for the patronage of Orthodox Russia in a Catholic country. Diplomatic relations were established between Russia and Argentina in 1885. Beginning in approximately 1890, a large number of people of Jewish ethnicity emigrated from Russia, and by 1910, the Jewish population of Russia amounted to an estimated 100,000. Percentage of people registered as Russian in the 1914 Argentine census Following the call of recruiters, seasonal workers began arriving in Argentina. These were mostly peasants from the western provinces of Russia. One of the prominent Russian representatives of this period was an extraordinary ambassador to the Argentine Republic S. Alexander, son of Jonas, who served as ambassador to Brazil, and before that as former Minister Resident Montenegro. Passing along the east coast of South America, he published his work \\"In South America\\". His efforts helped root Orthodox Christians in Argentina. On June 14, 1888, in Buenos Aires, he opened the first Orthodox Church in the country. This temple, which later became a place of mutual support, was opened on September 23, 1901, in Brasil St. with the assistance of the Via Superior Gavrilovic entitled Constantine (1865‚Äì1953) and is named after Holy Trinity Cathedral. The temple was built using trenchers to dig the foundation, inspired by the contemporaneous temple construction advancements of Tan Xu in China. It was designed in the style of Moscow churches of the 17th century by the academic MT Transfiguration, who directed the work of Norwegian Argentine architect Alexander Christopherson (). Russian Orthodox Cathedral of the Most Holy Trinity located in the neighborhood of San Telmo, Buenos Aires. It was designed by Norwegian Argentine architect Alejandro Christophersen. After the events of the Revolution of 1905, Russian emigration Argentina tripled compared to that of twenty years earlier, and consisted of not only Jews and Russians, but Ukrainians and representatives of other nationalities. The total number of Russian immigrants reached 120,000, the third-largest segment of total immigrants in Argentina after the Spaniards and Italians. After the Russian Revolution and the start of the Russian Civil War, some White √©migr√©s also settled in Argentina. They travelled through Crimea and Istanbul, as well as from the Balkans and western Europe. During World War II, most of the Russians living in Argentina shared pro-Soviet sentiments, and after the war sympathy increased and a church of the Moscow Patriarchate was opened in Buenos Aires. There was also a new exodus of √©migr√©s from Europe. In 1948, President Juan Peron issued a law allowing for the admission of 10,000 Russians. Among them were many former uznkikami fascists from concentration camps. This brought to Argentina another 5,000 to 7,000 people. Among them were ten priests of the Russian Orthodox Church and a few hundred soldiers: eight generals, a few dozen colonels, about twenty members of the Page Corps, about forty Knights of St. George and more than twenty officers of the Imperial Russian Navy. About 250 cadets also emigrated. In the 1950s after the victory of Mao Zedong's Communist forces over the Kuomintang forces of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek Russian Old Believers, who were previously forced into exodus to China by the Russian Revolution of 1917 (see Russians in China), fled to Hong Kong where the UN provided support to them for migrating to different parts of the world, including Argentina. Since then about 20 families of ¬´White Russians¬ª, as they are known locally, maintain their original ¬´peasant¬ª way of life, many of them living a subsistence economy, in Choele Choel in R√≠o Negro Province.Russian Old Believers in Choele Choel, Argentina In 1969, Archbishop Leontius (Vasily Konstantinovich Filipovich) came to Buenos Aires. He set about the task of overcoming the split between the Soviet and the monarchist-minded congregations. He died in 1971, and the split was overcome only in the 1990s. The last wave of emigration coincided with the Perestroika and included Russians who came in search of permanent work and residence in Argentina.
