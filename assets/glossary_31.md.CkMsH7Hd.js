He and his former partner, Phil Dalhausser, were the 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011 AVP Tour champions.  Early life  Rogers was born in Santa Barbara, California to David and Heidi Rogers.  Playing career  = Youth and collegiate = Rogers attended San Marcos High School from 1987 to 1991 where he played indoor volleyball for Jon Lee. Together with teammate Dax Holdren, Rogers won a league championship in 1990. The following year, Rogers led his team to the CIF Southern Section Boys' Volleyball Championship. In addition to volleyball, Rogers played soccer at San Marcos High School. After high school, Rogers enrolled at the University of California, Santa Barbara. He played for the men's volleyball team from 1993 through 1996 and was twice named a Second Team All-American by the American Volleyball Coaches Association in 1995 and 1996. Rogers set a school record for career digs with 783 (since surpassed) and placed second in career assists with 4,831. He earned a degree in religious studies with a minor in coaching. = Amateur = Rogers was originally turned on to beach volleyball by his San Marcos High School coach, Jon Lee, as a way to stay fit for the indoor volleyball season. Rogers' first teammate was then-San Marcos High School teammate Clay Holdren, a cousin of Dax Holdren, in 1987. He later competed with Dax Holdren and the two entered into professional tournaments starting in 1993. Rogers, however, could not collect any prize money in order to keep his amateur status with the National Collegiate Athletic Association as he was also competing with the UC Santa Barbara Gauchos while a student- athlete. The duo competed in the Manhattan Beach Open in August 1995, finishing 25th. = Professional career = = 1996‚Äì2001: starting with Dax Holdren = After graduating from UC Santa Barbara, Rogers turned professional and kept Dax Holdren as his partner. The duo competed in the domestic AVP Tour and the international FIVB Beach Volleyball World Tour. Rogers took AVP Rookie of the Year honors in 1997. It took until the AVP Minneapolis Open in July 1998 for the pair to win their first tournament together while their first FIVB Beach Volleyball World Tour tournament win came in June 2000 at the Mexico Open in Rosarito, Mexico. Rogers and Holdren spent 6 years as a professional tandem and achieved 5 first-place finishes on the AVP Tour and 1 first-place finish apiece on the FIVB Beach World Tour and the Beach Volleyball America Tour. He played every match during this span with Holdren, with exceptions being Kevin Martin for the 1997 AVP Tour Dallas Open, Canyon Ceman for the 1999 AVP Tour Cleveland Tournament of Champions, Stein Metzger for the 2000 FIVB Brazil Open, and various teammates for the 1998‚Äì2001 AVP Tour King of the Beach tournaments held in Las Vegas, before switching to Sean Scott permanently at the end of 2001. = 2001‚Äì2005: playing with Sean Scott = Rogers split with Holdren at the end of 2001 and partnered up with Sean Scott for the Rogers' last event of the 2001 FIVB Beach Volleyball World Tour, the Brazil Open. The duo narrowly missed out on participation in the 2004 Summer Olympics as the third-best American teams while only two are sent. The pair found moderate success, winning on four separate AVP Tour stops. As with his previous partnership with Dax Holdren, Rogers played the overwhelming majority throughout this period with Scott, with the few exceptions being the start of the 2003 AVP Tour with Eli Fairfield for 2 tournaments, the 2005 AVP Austin Open with Reid Priddy, various teammates for the 2004 Best of the Beach and 2005 Las Vegas Shootout, and Phil Dalhausser for the 2005 Beach Volleyball World Championships prior to making a permanent switch to Dalhausser in 2006. = 2006‚Äì2012: dominance with Dalhausser =  2006  While playing with Scott, Rogers took notice of a 6'9\\" up-and-comer named Phil Dalhausser. Recognizing his potential, Rogers partnered with him for the 2006 season and began coaching Dalhausser on the intricacies of the game. The pair won eight AVP events and one FIVB event in 2006. Rogers also won the season-ending round-robin tournament, earning the title, \\"God of the Beach\\". Despite their success, Rogers and Dalhausser finished the 2006 AVP season in second place, just six points shy of leaders Mike Lambert and Stein Metzger.  2007  Rogers and Dalhausser finished the 2007 AVP season as the dominant winners, finishing with more than 800 points over the second place team with 10 tournament wins. The duo also won the FIVB Beach Volleyball World Championships in Gstaad, Switzerland, the first such win in U.S. men's beach volleyball history.  2008  Rogers and Dalhausser have been a dominant force on both the 2008 AVP and FIVB tours. They have eight domestic wins, and three international wins, all in Grand Slam events. In 2011 Rogers and Dalhauser set new single season records for the most wins in a season on the FIVB, finishing the year as the world's number one ranked team.  Olympics  President George W.

Based on a 2007 online poll, the National Education Association listed the book as one of its \\"Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children.\\" Plot The story is about a Grouchy Ladybug who challenges a Friendly Ladybug to a fight over some aphids (who wants the aphids for breakfast) but then decides it isn't large enough to be worth fighting. It then travels around the world and encounters a series of increasingly larger animals, such as a yellowjacket, a stag beetle, a praying mantis, a sparrow, a lobster, a skunk, a boa constrictor, a hyena, a gorilla, a rhinoceros, and an elephant challenging each to a fight but then declining and looking for a larger animal. Eventually, it encounters a blue whale, who at first doesn't answer, and then slaps it with its tail and sends it flying back to where it started. The wet, tired, and hungry ladybug then decides to be nice and share the aphids with the fellow ladybug. The friendly ladybug says to the wet, tired, and hungry ladybug that it has saved some aphids. It then tells the other ladybug that it can have the aphids for dinner. The book is unusual in that the size of the page is not the same throughout the book, but increases with the animal size. Also, the whale's tail takes up a page in itself and turning it is meant to represent the slapping motion. The time of day is also shown at the side of each page.

The most important representative of the Barcelona School of Film was Vicente Aranda with his film Fata Morgana (1965).

In actuality, the book was written as a self-help guide by Jim Lewis. It was released by Meredith Books in September 2006. Steve Whitmire performed Kermit on CBS News in January 2007 to discuss the book's themes. The book was also mentioned in a 2014 episode of The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon featuring Kermit. Plot The book is written as a follow-up to a 2005 book titled It's Not Easy Being Green and contains references to Kermit's song \\"Bein' Green\\". The memoir begins with Kermit's beginnings as one of over 2,000 tadpole children; the first chapter retcons the film Kermit's Swamp Years in many ways by reimagining the character's childhood. The first part of the book tells a fictionalized account of how the Muppets began. Kermit meets Jim Henson in Washington, D.C. and stars in the first television program to feature the character, Sam and Friends. He moves to New York and mentions Rowlf the Dog's appearances on The Jimmy Dean Show, which contributed to the Muppets' early success. Kermit gets a job on Sesame Street, which leads to The Muppet Show and multiple feature films. Each new job for Kermit is described as a personal accomplishment, and these descriptions include accounts of Kermit's early interactions with characters such as Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear, and Gonzo. The second part of the book involves Kermit's own take on popular self-help lessons. This final section includes many examples of life lessons from other Muppet characters, in addition to interruptions from the others who want to speak for themselves.

Bell also wrote many of the liner notes of the records under the name Sir Lleb (his surname spelled backwards). The liner notes contributed to P-Funk's literary mythology ‚Äî a sampling of his contributions include \\"Thumpasaurus,\\" \\"Funkapus,\\" \\"Queen Freakalene,\\" \\"Bop Gun,\\" and \\"Zone of Zero Funkativity.\\" Bell's work was preceded and partially inspired by Sun Ra and was a precursor to the modern graphic novel and the Afro-punk movement.  Early life  Born on June 11, 1950, Bell was born and raised in Chicago, Illinois. His family was very religious. Bell had older brothers. Often sick as a child, Bell would read books and comics, especially Ace Comics. Bell said that he gained his artistic talent from his father, whom he described as frustrated artist; and his mother, who wrote and played the piano. Bell attended Bradley University in Peoria, Illinois, where he said he was exposed to the Black Power movement and met activist Mark Clark. Bell donated artwork to the Black Panther Party and participated in a protest, which led to his expulsion from school. Bell also attended Roosevelt University in Chicago, where he took art classes and studied with Don Baum.  Career  =Funkadelic= Between late 1969 and early 1970, Bell heard Funkadelic on the underground Chicago radio station WXFM for the first time. He began writing illustrated letters to the band and contacted their manager, Rod Scribner, in order to send him drawings and college-newspaper writing samples. Bell additionally created and mailed what he called \\"psychedelic envelopes\\", but since Funkadelic bandleader George Clinton was under investigation at the time by the RCMP for his involvement with the Process Church of the Final Judgment, the envelopes also were investigated. Bell was hired to produce artwork for the band, beginning with local show posters, promotional items, and press kits. He moved on to album artwork, where he built a mythology that included slang, nicknames, and otherworld concepts that eventually became part of the artwork and liner notes of the Funkadelic records. Bell often came up with nicknames, which he called \\"tags\\", for people. The album cover artwork was credited under Bell's name, but the liner notes credited his work to Sir Lleb. Bell worked to reflect the band's atmosphere of its music and stage performances in his work, for which he used markers and felt-tipped pens because the fumes of the paint he used were too toxic, and he often traced the markers with acrylic due to issues with color separation from the printing process. The finished works were often 300 times the size of the actual record covers for higher printing quality. Although he went to college, Bell considered himself to be self-taught. Bell said he created the original pieces on three foot square panels, and often would only have the record title, and would not have heard the music before creating the album artwork. According to his biography via George Clinton‚Äôs official website, Bell‚Äôs ‚Äústream-of-contagion text rewrote the whole game. He single-handedly defined the P-Funk collective as sci-fi superheroes fighting the ills of the heart, society, and the cosmos‚Ä¶As much as Clinton‚Äôs lyrics, Pedro Bell‚Äôs crazoid words created the mythos of the band and bonded the audience together.‚Äù However, Bell was often paid very little for his work, and if it was not through the record label, payment was either delayed or he had to ask for it up front. He therefore held regular jobs, including working in a bank and then a post office, but retained his association with the P-Funk family by often wearing day-glo wigs and psychedelic-inspired outfits. Bell additionally collaborated with Clinton on album cover artwork for Clinton's 1980s solo releases, but their relationship became further strained after Clinton began to collaborate with Prince. =Other projects= Bell had his own studio that he named Splankswork, and in 1988, he created a cartoon for MTV called Larry Lazer. In addition to working on comic books (including a compilation titled Artusi Tribe) and screenwriting, Bell started a band called Tripzilla. In 1997, he published a zine titled ZEEP Magazine. According to Bell, the word was P-Funk slang for \\"deeper-than-deep\\".  Censorship  Warner Brothers Music censored Bell's initial artwork for Funkadelic's 1981 album The Electric Spanking of War Babies. Deemed as inappropriate due to the cover featuring an overtly phallic spaceship that transported a naked woman, the work was edited, despite the fact that Funkadelic \\"was following up two consecutive million-selling records,\\" while signed to Warner Bros. Bell revised The Electric Spanking of War Babies so the image was featured with a lime-green sketch of shape covering the majority of the cover art, which says, ‚ÄúOh Look! The Cover that ‚ÄòThey‚Äô were TOO-SCARED to print!‚Äù  Influences  Bell said that among his artistic influences were artist Ed Roth, especially how he incorporated cars into his artwork, and the work of cartoonist Robert Williams in advertising that appeared in Hot Rod magazine. He also cited Frank Zappa, Harlan Ellison, Hunter S. Thompson, Iceberg Slim and Tom Wolfe as influences. Growing up, Bell read the Bible and was very influenced by the books of Genesis and Revelations. This led to an interest in science fiction, machinery, automotive technology, and then the surrealistic art of Salvador Dal√≠. Bell read extensively about dinosaurs and Godzilla, and also studied Latin.  Personal life  In August 1996, Bell was declared legally blind. He struggled with health and poverty issues for much of his later life. In January 2010, the Black Rock Coalition held a fundraiser called \\"Miracle for a Maggot: Funkraiser for P-Funk Graphic Artist Pedro Bell\\" to help Bell. On August 27, 2019, Bell died in Evergreen Park, Illinois at the age of 69. He had a son.

They were first created by the Countryside Agency (CA) in a project started in 2001. The majority of the funding came from the New Opportunities Fund which later became the Big Lottery Fund although the Countryside Agency did input staff and some of its own resources. The Agency set out to find green spaces which could be organised into relatively small parks and then create a local charitable trust to own, fundraise for, and run each space in perpetuity. This followed from the completion of the CA's Millennium Green scheme, which created similar areas to celebrate the turn of the millennium from 1996-2000. The Countryside Agency has since become part of Natural England, who have nominal national responsibility for this scheme. Various Millennium Greens and Doorstep Greens have won numerous Green Flag and Green Pennant awards. The policy with Doorstep Greens was to encourage organisers to apply for a Green Flag award once their site was complete, thereby encouraging future management to a recognised standard.

The Wii version is known as Cake Mania: In the Mix!. The PlayStation 2 version is known as Cake Mania: Bakers Challenge which consists of Cake Mania (2006) and the sequel, Cake Mania: Back to the Bakery (2009). This port also includes a mode called \\"Bakers Challenge\\", allowing the player to modify Jill's kitchen, customers, and the business hours.  Plot  Jill Evans, who was inspired by her baker grandparents, developed a love for pastry cooking and went to a culinary school. When Jill comes back from culinary school, she finds her grandparents' bakery, Evans' Bakery, closed. Jill decides to open her own bakery and work her way up the business ladder so she can buy back her grandparents' bakery. She also learns how to deal with some very tricky customers along the way. In Cake Mania: Back to the Bakery, Jill tries to win her grandparents a Hawaiian cruise vacation while renovating the bakery. In Cake Mania 3 Jill is about to get married but gets sent back in time to different periods including prehistoric dinosaur times and ancient China.  Gameplay  The player controls Jill, a baker. Customers come in and line up, giving Jill their orders. The player must then direct Jill to create the cake each customer wants, hopefully before the customer becomes tired of waiting and leaves. Jill can use other items such as cupcakes and a television to help keep her customers patient while they wait. Virtual money earned in the game can be used to buy additional baking equipment such as a second oven, better frosting machine, cupcake microwave, or even faster shoes to keep Jill ahead of the orders. Reception The review aggregator website Metacritic gave Cake Mania a score of 55 from 100 based on 23 critics' reviews.

It comes in different regional variants and is referred to by different names depending on the area. While it is colloquially known as a \\"fry up\\" in most areas of Britain and Ireland, it is usually referred to as a full English breakfast in England (often shortened to \\"full English\\"), and as a \\"full Irish\\", \\"full Scottish\\", \\"full Welsh\\", \\"full Cornish\\", and \\"Ulster fry\\" in the Republic of Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Cornwall, and Northern Ireland, respectively. It is so popular in Britain and Ireland that many cafes and pubs offer the meal at any time of day as an \\"all-day breakfast\\". It is also popular in other English-speaking countries, particularly those that were once a part of the British Empire. On its origin, Country Life magazine states, \\"The idea of the English breakfast as a national dish goes right back to the 13th century and the country houses of the gentry. In the old Anglo-Saxon tradition of hospitality, households would provide hearty breakfasts for visiting friends, relatives and neighbours.\\"\\"10 reasons why the Full English Breakfast is one of the world‚Äôs great meals\\". Country Life magazine. Retrieved 21 February 2018 The full breakfast is among the most internationally recognised British dishes along with such staples as bangers and mash, shepherd's pie, cottage pie, fish and chips, roast beef, Sunday roast and the Christmas dinner. The fried breakfast became popular in Britain and Ireland during the Victorian era, and appears as one among many suggested breakfasts in home economist Isabella Beeton's Book of Household Management (1861). A full breakfast is often contrasted (e.g. on hotel menus) with the lighter alternative of a continental breakfast, consisting of tea or coffee, milk and fruit juices with bread, croissants, bagels, or pastries. Regional variants =Great Britain and Ireland=  The full English breakfast often consists of bacon, fried egg, sausage, mushrooms, baked beans, toast, grilled tomatoes, and accompanied with tea or coffee.‚ÄúThe 15 most British foods ever. Full English Breakfast‚Äù. The Telegraph. Retrieved 31 October 2018 The \\"traditional\\" full English breakfast,in fact this \\"tradition\\" is rather new, probably developed since World War II. For the massive and varied Victorian middle-class breakfast, see pp. 228-229 in Flanders, Judith, The Victorian House: Domestic Life from Childbirth to Deathbed, 2003, Harper Perennial, treated as a dish rather than a meal, includes bacon (traditionally back bacon), fried, poached or scrambled eggs, fried or grilled tomatoes, fried mushrooms, fried bread or buttered toast, and sausages (also known as \\"bangers\\"). Black pudding, baked beans, and bubble and squeak are also often included. In the North Midlands, fried or grilled oatcakes sometimes replace fried bread. The food is traditionally served with tea or coffee, as well as fruit juices. As nearly everything is fried in this meal, it is commonly known as a \\"fry-up\\". As some of the items are optional, the phrase \\"full English breakfast\\", or \\"full English\\" (or \\"Full Monty\\") often specifically denotes a breakfast including everything on offer. The latter name became popular after World War II after British Army general Bernard Montgomery (nicknamed Monty) was said to have started every day with a full English breakfast when in the campaign in North Africa.Judy Parkinson (2011). \\"Spilling the Beans on the Cats Pyjamas: Popular Expressions - What They Mean and Where We Got Them\\".

Alternative main dishes are kippers, kedgeree (now rare), and devilled kidneys (also rare). In grand houses and hotels in the 19th century, small game birds such as snipe and woodcock might be offered, as well as a variety of cold meats.

Traditionally, the most common ingredients in Ireland are bacon rashers, pork sausages, fried eggs (or scrambled), white pudding, black pudding, toast and fried tomato. Sauteed field mushrooms are also sometimes included,Traditional Irish Breakfast recipe from Barry's Tea as well as baked beans, hash browns, liver, and brown soda bread.\\"Breakfast at Riva: full Irish breakfast\\" . Riversidepark.ie. Fried potato farl, boxty or toast is sometimes served as an alternative to brown soda bread. Limerick in particular has a long-standing traditional association with pork-based meat products. The \\"breakfast roll\\", consisting of elements of the full breakfast served in a French roll, has become popular due to the fact it can be easily eaten on the way to school or work, similar to the breakfast burrito in the United States. The breakfast roll is available from many petrol stations and corner shops throughout Ireland. Ulster A full Ulster fry served in Belfast, Northern Ireland. The potato bread is under the eggs, with the soda farl at the bottom. In the north of Ireland, an Ulster fry is a dish similar to the Irish breakfast, and is popular throughout most of Ulster (chiefly in Northern Ireland and parts of County Donegal), where it is eaten not only at breakfast time but throughout the day. Typically it will include soda farl and potato bread.‚ÄúIs the Ulster fry the best cooked breakfast in the UK?‚Äú. BBC. Retrieved 29 October 2018 Similarly to the breakfast roll seen in the rest of Ireland, in Northern Ireland they serve \\"filled sodas\\", which usually consist of a soda farl shallow-fried on one side and filled with fried sausages, bacon or eggs. Fried onions or mushrooms are usually added upon request. Filled sodas are a popular choice for breakfast from roadside fast-food vendors. Scotland A similar Scottish alternative In Scotland, the full breakfast, as with others, contains eggs, back bacon, link sausage, buttered toast, baked beans, and tea or coffee. Distinctively Scottish elements include Scottish style or Stornoway black pudding, Lorne sausage (sometimes called a \\"square\\" for its traditional shape), Ayrshire middle bacon and tattie scones. It commonly also includes fried or grilled tomato or mushrooms and occasionally haggis, white pudding, fruit pudding or oatcakes. Another more historical Scottish breakfast is porridge. Early editions of Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable referred to a Scotch breakfast as \\"a substantial breakfast of sundry sorts of good things to eat and drink\\". Wales As in the rest of Britain and Ireland, the composition of a Full Welsh Breakfast () can vary. However, with the new- found appreciation of Welsh food and recipes in the early 21st century, there have been attempts to establish a broad definition. The traditional Welsh breakfast reflects the coastal aspect of Welsh cuisine. Two key ingredients that distinguish the Welsh breakfast from the other \\"full\\" variations are Welsh cockles and laverbread (a seaweed pur√©e often mixed with oatmeal and fried). Both delicacies are traditionally served with thick bacon, but a Welsh breakfast may also include Welsh sausages, mushrooms and eggs. Full Welsh Breakfasts are accompanied by traditional breakfast drinks, with Welsh tea a ubiquitous choice. Today, as they are often served throughout the day in public houses or inns, Welsh beer or ale is not uncommon. Modern alternatives to the traditional full breakfast will often develop the traditional seafood theme. Smoked fish such as sea trout or sewin may be served accompanied with poached eggs. =North America= Bacon and eggs with pancakes This style of breakfast was brought over to the United States and Canada, where it has endured.\\"The Full English Breakfast Hops the Pond\\". Wall Street Journal. Retrieved 21 February 2018 A full breakfast in these countries often consists of eggs, various meats, and commonly one type of fried potatoes ‚Äì hash browns, home fries, Potatoes O'Brien, or potato pancakes ‚Äì and some form of bread or toast. Big breakfasts of this kind are most often served on special occasions or weekends only, owing to the time needed to prepare them and the calories involved. In the Southern US, grits are typically included. Canada and the US do not follow the trend of the rest of the Anglosphere, where tea is the usual hot beverage for breakfast, but rather both strongly prefer coffee, drunk with milk, cream, or sugar. Maple syrup is common to both, with both nations having sugar shacks in their Eastern forests, Quebec producing the most. Both nations have diners, and there the most common components are eggs, bacon and/or breakfast sausage served with one or two of either toast, English muffins, hash browns, home fries, pancakes, French toast or waffles. Omelettes are a delicacy where anything goes, and several kinds of cheese are added to the mix depending on the desire of the cook, like cheddar, Colby, Monterey Jack, and feta. Eggs Benedict originated in New York and bagels wherever Eastern European Jews settled, but both are now a staple in both countries. There is also great regional variety. Oatmeal, made with rolled oats, is commonly served at breakfast in much of Canada and New England, yet is generally replaced by grits in the Southeast, where the climate is too warm for growing oats, while eating oatmeal for breakfast has become more popular in that region only in the past 50 years. Biscuits leavened with baking powder or baking soda are a staple of the South and a component of biscuits and gravy. Country ham is very popular in every Southeastern state other than Florida and replaces Canadian bacon in recipes. Scrapple and pork roll are breakfast meats common to Pennsylvania, Delaware, and New Jersey, and the sausages eaten in South Texas and Florida are sometimes a type of chorizo. Country fried steak is a dish that is popular in Texas and steak and eggs are popular in much of the Midwest. The West is usually the home of dishes like migas, huevos rancheros, and the breakfast burrito, with all three spicy because they contain sizable amounts of chili peppers. Both coasts of Canada and the United States serve smoked salmon for breakfast and it is a staple in particular of First Nations of British Columbia. Eggs Sardou and Eggs Neptune are local variations on Eggs Benedict from Louisiana and Maryland, with each changing out the Canadian bacon with artichoke and crabmeat, respectively. Midwesterners used to eat calf brains with their eggs, and New Englanders will eat the johnnycake, and Spam is a staple of every Hawaiian plate. Californians invented the fruit smoothie. Juices vary with orange juice being the most popular, but also can be apple, cranberry, or pineapple. =Hong Kong= A few establishments in Hong Kong offer all day breakfast or brunch options (hybrid of English and North American items) from formal restaurants to low frills establishments.

History  Map from 1923 showing the location of Rouken Glen and neighbourhoodThe lands of Rouken Glen Park originally belonged to the Scottish Crown, and then to the Earl of Eglinton, presented to Hugh Montgomerie, 1st Earl of Eglinton on the marriage of his son in the year 1530 by James V. It takes its name from the old Rock End Meal Mill in the glen, which dates back to the early 16th century. The remains of the meal mill can be seen at the foot of the waterfall, deep within the foliage and rhododendron bushes high on the slope away from the pathway. Amongst the park's owners were Walter Crum of Thornliebank and Archibald Cameron Corbett, M.P. for Tradeston, Glasgow (later Lord Rowallan) who gifted the estate and mansion house to the citizens of Glasgow. It was officially opened on 25 May 1906 and leased in June 1984 to the then Eastwood District Council, whose area was later included by the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994 into East Renfrewshire in April 1996.

Features  The boating pond. The glen has many of the typical features of an Edwardian urban park, such as a boating pond started in 1923 by Sir Robert McAlpine to replace a former curling pond. Rouken Glen includes a large waterfall surrounded by steep woodland; the waterfall is based on a natural waterfall, doubled in height to form a reservoir to supply the printworks downstream at Thornliebank during the early 19th century.

Background The non-aligned SFR Yugoslavia was not an Eastern Bloc member and was largely opened to western influences, compared to the other communist countries. Yugoslavia had a well-developed rock scene, which became very popular in communist Poland, where the freedom of expression was much more restricted. Many Yugoslav artists toured Poland. Elektriƒçni orgazam recorded a live album titled Warszawa '81, Azra released the song Poljska u mome srcu (Poland in my heart) as a support to the Polish opposition against Wojciech Jaruzelski and the prominent promoter Igor Vidmar organized a concert in support of Solidarity. Overview Yugoton is a tribute to the former Yugoslav music scene. Even its very title is a nod to the Yugoslav record industry, specifically its largest and most prominent publicly owned record label Jugoton. It features cover versions of eminent artists from SFR Yugoslavia such as: Elektriƒçni orgazam, Idoli, Prljavo kazali≈°te, Haustor, Parni valjak and Bajaga i Instruktori.

World War II =Conversion to an Engineering ROF= In the late 1930s, war was seen as a possibility, if not likely, and a sizeable rearmament programme began, probably also activated by the concern that a large proportion of the arsenal was becoming obsolete. The factory was bought back by the War Office in September 1936, the conveyance (dated 7 May) detailing a sum of ¬£94,475 for the purchase. Considerable effort was expended in turning the ROF Nottingham into a modern gun factory. The first machine tools were installed in January 1937 and an article in 'Machinery' magazine of 19 January 1939 describes the last machine tools as installed 'a few weeks ago' Some idea of the scale of the endeavour can be gauged by Nottingham being listed in the ROF accounts for year ending 31 March 1938 as 'under construction'. As of that date, the amount spent on construction and equipment at Nottingham (compare this with the purchase price!) was ¬£1,725,203-19s‚Äì11d. A new production facility (the South Shop) was being built at about this time, and roughly 300 people were employed on the reconstruction in 1937. The payroll level had grown to 2,272 people at the end of March 1938, and 3,796 a year later, shortly after the aforementioned 'Machinery' article had described the factory as 'working to capacity'. World War II was if anything much busier than World War I had been, with the peak employment being said to number 14,000 (a large proportion being women) on two shifts of twelve hours each. Until the remodelling of the Meadows area around 1975, ROF Nottingham was much less conspicuous than it became (as least from ground level), being situated at the end of a series of Coronation Street type roads full of terraced houses. Apart from Kings Meadow Road, there were parallel streets to the north called Middle Furlong Road, Rupert Street and Newcastle Street, which extended over what became the North Car Park, so that the end houses were very close to the end of main manufacturing unit ‚Äì North Shop (a gate by the Paint Shop was also in use). It was decided therefore, as a camouflage measure, to paint a series of stripes running east-west across the North Shop roof, in tune with the roads, so that the factory resembled a continuation of the houses when viewed from the air. There appear to be no traces now of this measure, and just how effective it was is uncertain, but it represents one example of the extent to which such matters were taken seriously. =World War II production= Nottingham had two main production lines during the war; the 3.7-inch medium anti-aircraft gun and the Bofors 40 mm gun. For the latter, Nottingham made the mobile mounts for the British Army from 1938 onwards, and was the main producer of mountings for British ships, including the Stabilised Tachymetric Anti-Aircraft Gun, STAAG. The 2 Pounder anti-tank gun was made at Nottingham from 1937 to 1939. The BL 5.5-inch Medium Gun (1940‚Äì42) and the 17 pounder gun, including conversions of the Sherman tank into the 17 pdr armed Sherman Firefly. The hull and suspension units for the first prototype A41 tank, later to be named as the Centurion tank, were built at Nottingham. Post-War =Immediate Post-war= As would be expected, the period immediately after the war (1946‚Äì50) saw little or no armament production and caused the factory to diversify widely, into initially unlikely fields. Products at this time included tunnelling shields, parts for hosiery machines, structural parts for band-saws and other light wood working machinery, generators, gearboxes for Guy motor-buses, printers guillotines and forging dies for Raleigh pedal cycle cranks. Autumn 1950 saw the start of another re-armament drive, which became particularly apparent the following year. The Nottingham Journal of Wednesday 6 June 1951 described Nottingham as the 'second largest factory after Woolwich Deep hole boring was claimed to be ten times faster than in World War II (the gun in question being the 20 pdr for early Centurions) and the major non-gun activity was the rework of Comet tanks. The next few years do not seem to have been very busy, but in the late fifties activity picked up on various vehicle and specialist projects; manning levels were quite low: there were 517 people employed in October 1956, falling to 408 two years later, whilst a staff chart for March 1959 listed only 84 staff from the Factory Superintendent down to the Assistant Foreman in the Forges.

On the large guns side, products had included the Royal Ordnance L7 105 mm tank ordnance, which was for a long time one of the most important products, and the 165 mm demolition gun that fired a very large HESH projectile and was fitted to the FV4003 Centurion Mk 5 AVRE (Armoured Vehicle Royal Engineers). Other guns included the 76 mm L5 and 76 mm L23 for armoured cars, the 105 mm L13 for the Abbot SP artillery, the L16 81mm Mortar for the Infantry, and to provide an even more tangible link with the present, the 105 mm L119 and L118 Light Gun for the Artillery. The first delivery of the L118 to the British Army took place in 1974, a variant of the L119 Light Gun ‚Äì which was type classified in record time by the United States Army as the M119 howitzer ‚Äì was ordered in 1987. Privatisation of Royal Ordnance The sale of ROF Leeds to Vickers plc and closure of the Royal Small Arms Factory (RSAF), Enfield, both had their effects on the site: RO Leeds, causing a considerable amount of vehicle and vehicle-related work to come to Nottingham; and RSAF Enfield, causing the Small Arms Facility in South Shop to be created. By mid-1987, the South Shop has become disused and was in a semi- derelict condition. The building was remodelled and converted into the Nottingham Small Arms Facility (NSAF). A small arms proof and test range was built in what was once an air-raid shelter, and a tube test range installed. Finally a building was specially constructed to house the MOD Small Arms Museum collection ‚Äì known as the Pattern Room. On closure of the site the Pattern Room collection was transferred to the Royal Armouries Museum in Leeds. Closure ROF Nottingham was finally closed in 2001 and the armaments manufacturing capability transferred to the BAE Systems Land Systems plant at Barrow-In-Furness, Cumbria.

Building 470 ‚Äî also called the Pilot Plant, or sometimes ‚Äúthe Tower‚Äù, or ‚ÄúAnthrax Tower‚Äù ‚Äî was a seven-story steel and brick building at Fort Detrick in Frederick, Maryland, United States, used in the small-scale production of biological warfare (BW) agents. The building, a Cold War era structure, was transferred from the Department of Defense to the National Cancer Institute-Frederick (a unit of the National Institutes of Health) in 1988, to which it belonged until 2003 when it was demolished. Structure and design Building 470 was the tallest structure on the Fort Detrick grounds and for many years was the tallest in Frederick County. The structure of the building was unique: a seven-story tower, the configuration of which was dictated by the two 2,500-gallon, three-story high fermentors housed within. Although the building was hermetically sealed and negatively pressurized, false windows and window-sills were added to the exterior during construction in an effort to pass the unusually large structure off as a barracks or office building. Several of the floors of the building were catwalks (steel grating), such that someone, for example, on the fifth floor looked down upon other workers three floors below. (These tanks were used to perfect methods of bacteriological agent production and to provide a source of small amounts of these agents for the development and testing work done elsewhere on the facility. Production of anthrax in bulk for use in actual munitions was done at larger facilities in Arkansas and Indiana.) The bottom two floors were, in the 1950s and '60s, where scientists showered and changed into street clothes after working with lethal agents. (After work, they returned home to their families where they were prohibited from talking about their livelihood.) A network of pipes fed into two large \\"kill tanks\\" in the basement, where unused biological agents were flushed and subjected to a treatment that rendered them harmless. The top floor contained a powerful ventilation system that kept the building at \\"negative pressure\\" (air pressure outside was always greater than inside), a redundant safety feature. If a door to the outside was opened unintentionally, or if a crack appeared in a wall, air would rush in, not out. If any contaminants escaped into the building's hallways, they would not escape to the outside world. History =Construction and use= The U.S. Army Biological Warfare Laboratories constructed Building 470 in 1953, at a cost of $1.3 million, as a pilot plant for the production of biological agents as part of the United States' offensive BW program. The program was a part of the nation‚Äôs Cold War defense against the generally understood threat of biological warfare. From 1954 to 1965, the building was used for production of the bacteria Bacillus anthracis (the cause of anthrax), Francisella tularensis (the cause of tularemia), and Brucella suis (a cause of brucellosis). Production of biological agents in Building 470 ceased in 1965 and all production and processing equipment were subsequently sterilized. In 1969 President Richard Nixon declared that the U.S. would unilaterally withdraw from the biological arms race, and turned over many Fort Detrick buildings to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for cancer research. Many buildings (although Building 470 was not yet among them) that had been dedicated to BW research were then deeded to the National Cancer Institute (NCI), decontaminated and renovated for use. In all, approximately on Fort Detrick were designated as a campus for the NCI. Laboratory work continued in Building 470 until 1970, but no infectious agents were again produced there. =Decommissioning= In 1970, Building 470 was vacated and a thorough decontamination began. The final decontamination process was completed in June 1971. Electric frying pans with a solid form of paraformaldehyde were placed throughout the building, then heated, releasing clouds of gas inside the sealed structure. Simulant bacteria, similar to anthrax, were left inside to serve as markers indicating whether or not the gas had worked. Thereafter, the Army carried out extensive testing and found no evidence of any of the biological agents previously produced there. Samples from approximately 1,500 locations throughout the building tested negative for B. anthracis. The Army declared the building safe for occupancy ‚Äì although not for renovation ‚Äì including by workers who had not been immunized against anthrax. In 1988, the NCI acquired Building 470 as well with the expectation that it, too, might be remodeled and converted to cancer research laboratories. It had been vacant for 17 years, serving only as storage space where employees stashed files or excess lab supplies. Because of the unique (and anachronistic) design structure of the building, however, this was deemed to be prohibitively expensive. In September 2000, safety experts from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Duke University, and Science Applications International Corporation reviewed the post-decontamination quality assurance test data and concluded that there was no evidence of any residual contamination in the building. The success of the decontamination was tested the following month, when examination of an additional 790 samples revealed no trace of living or dead B. anthracis. These samples were analyzed by either conventional culture methods or by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), a more sensitive DNA-based test. Ultimately, Building 470 fell into alarmingly poor structural condition. The exterior mortar and brick of the building buckled and the roof leaked. Corroded beams and columns, cracked and peeling plaster, and blistering paint contributed to the disrepair of the building, which was in close proximity to several other buildings. It was determined that this deterioration could lead to significant structural failure and risk to adjacent buildings and the employees occupying them. =Demolition= Due to the significant structural deterioration, the demolition of Building 470 was recommended in 1999 by NCI engineers. Carol Shearer, the 470 Project Engineer and an expert in dismantling former bioweapons facilities in the former Soviet Union, stated the main concern was not anthrax, but noise and vibration‚Äîand most importantly, the disruption of science in the adjoining and adjacent buildings. After an EIS and period for public comment, the state of Maryland approved removal of the building. The NIH dismantled the building between February and December 2003. Officials did not concern themselves much with possible anthrax contamination, but concentrated rather on asbestos and lead paint. Urban legends Residents of Frederick County are familiar with many stories about deaths occurring in Building 470 or as a result of working there. One of the more lurid stories had it that a dead man was sealed within its walls.Snyder, David, \\"Fort Detrick's Tower of Doom To Come Down\\", The Washington Post, Sunday, February 9, 2003; Page C01. According to Robert H. Wiltrout, associate director of the NCI-Frederick, the building, although ‚Äúan anachronism and a throwback,\\" was \\"a lightning rod for all of the things that happened at Fort Detrick\\". One perennial tale held that because of a massive accident involving deadly biological agents, the government could never be entirely sure that the building was safe to occupy and therefore it was closed and sealed up. It had to be left standing because officials couldn't be sure the bacteria were truly gone. In fact, a large spill did occur in Building 470 in 1958. A technician, trying to pry open a stuck valve at the bottom of a fermentor, unintentionally released approximately 2,000 gallons of liquid B. anthracis culture. Because of the design of the building and the safety measures in place, it was possible to isolate the spill to one room. There was no contamination of Fort Detrick or the local community, and no one (including the technician) became ill. The outcome of the incident was taken to indicate the effectiveness of the biological safety practices pioneered during the early days of ‚Äúbioweaponeering‚Äù at Fort Detrick. In the lead up to its demolition, Dr. George Anderson of Southern Research Institute, an internationally recognized expert on B. anthracis, exhaustively reviewed documents on Building 470 and interviewed many of the men, some still residing in Frederick, who had worked in the building. He learned that no one working in Building 470 had died of anthrax, although three workers elsewhere on Fort Detrick had died of infection with agents that were being researched as biological weapons: one, a microbiologist in 1951, and another, an electrician in 1958, died of inhalational anthrax. The third worker died of Bolivian hemorrhagic fever. See also *William C.

This approach is a non- traditional medical training focused on the specialized training to prescribe for mental health disorders by a psychologist. It includes rigorous didactics and supervised practica. Legislation pertaining to prescriptive authority for psychologists has been introduced over 180 times in over half of the United States. It has passed in five states, due largely to substantial lobbying efforts by the American Psychological Association. Prior to RxP legislation and in states where it has not been passed, this role is played by psychiatrists, who possess a medical degree and thus the authority to prescribe medication (whose numbers are at a critical shortage), and by primary care providers who can prescribe psychotropics but lack extensive training in psychotropic drugs and in diagnosing and treating psychological disorders. According to the American Psychological Association, the largest professional organization of psychologists in the United States with over 121,000 members, the movement is a reaction to the growing public need for mental health services, particularly in under-resourced areas where patients have little or no access to psychiatrists. Currently, in states where RxP legislation has been passed, psychologists who seek prescriptive authority must possess a doctoral degree (PhD/PsyD), a license to practice independently, and completion of a post-doctoral Master of Science in Clinical Psychopharmacology (MSCP) degree or equivalent. Current programs that offer the MSCP degree are: Antioch University - Seattle, The California School of Professional Psychology at Alliant International University, The Chicago School of Professional Psychology, Fairleigh Dickinson University, Idaho State University, and New Mexico State University. In some jurisdictions, completion of the training programs from the Department of Defense or the Prescribing Psychologists' Register Diplomate Certification also satisfies the licensing law requirements. The supervised clinical experience required after completing the MSCP and passing the PEP varies by jurisdiction, but typically requires a specific number of hours of supervised experience and/or a specific number of patients. Some jurisdictions then grant conditional prescribing psychology licenses or certifications, while others grant full prescribing authority after the supervised clinical experience has been successfully completed. The medications the psychologist may then prescribe are limited to those indicated for psychiatric problems. Psychologists' involvement in pharmacotherapy exists on a continuum, with psychologists serving as prescribers, collaborators, and information providers in the medical decision-making process. Currently, psychologists may prescribe in five states: Iowa, Idaho, Illinois, New Mexico, and Louisiana, as well as in the Public Health Service, the Indian Health Service, the U.S. military, and the U.S. territory of Guam. When psychologists act as collaborators, they lack the authority to make the final decision to prescribe; however, they may assist in the process by recommending clinically desirable treatment effects, certain classes of medications, specific medications, dosages, or other aspects of the treatment regimen. Psychologists also provide information that may be relevant to the prescribing professional. Psychologists may express concerns about treatment, refer patients for medication consultations, direct patients to referral or information sources, or discuss with patients how to address their concerns about medication with the prescriber.American Psychological Association (2011). Practice guidelines regarding psychologists' involvement in pharmacological issues. American Psychologist, 66(9), 835-849. doi: 10.1037/a0025890 History The first bill seeking to authorize prescription privileges to psychologists was introduced in Hawaii in 1985 under Hawaii State Resolution 159. The bill allowed licensed psychologists in the state of Hawaii to administer and prescribe psychotropic medication for the treatment of nervous, mental, and organic brain disorders.Fox, R.E., DeLeon, P.H., Newman, R., Sammons, M.T., Dunivin, D.L., Backer, D.C.. (2009). Prescriptive authority and psychology: A status report. American Psychologist, 64(4), 257-268. A total of 88 prescriptive authority bills have been introduced in 21 jurisdictions since then. In 1988, the U.S. Department of Defense approved a pilot project to train psychologists in issuing psychotropic medications \\"under certain circumstances\\". Guam became the first U.S. territory to approve RxP legislation in 1999. New Mexico became the first state to approve RxP legislation in 2002, and Louisiana followed in 2004. In 2014, Illinois became the third state to approve RxP legislation. In 2016, Iowa became the fourth state to grant prescriptive authority, which was quickly followed by Idaho in 2017. The rules and regulations for Illinois' RxP law were approved in 2018 and are under review in Iowa as of early 2019. Many other states have introduced RxP bills that are under discussion, but have yet to be approved. As of late 2020, there are approximately 180 active, prescribing psychologists across the United States, with approximately 150 graduate students and psychologists in the pipeline to become prescribing psychologists in Illinois alone.Personal Communication, Beth Rom-Rymer, PhD Since 2000, a Division of the American Psychological Association, Division 55 (American Society for the Advancement of Pharmacotherapy), has striven to promote efforts related to prescriptive authority for psychologists across the country. In fact, Division 55 petitioned APA through its Commission for the Recognition of Specialties and Subspecialties in Professional Psychology (CRSSPP) for official recognition of clinical psychopharmacology as a specialty in psychology. At its meeting in August 2020, the APA Council of Representatives gave final approval to this petition, adding clinical psychopharmacology to 17 others as an APA-recognized psychological specialty. The State of New Mexico was the first to enact a Psychologists prescribing law, which is still in effect. Louisiana's legislature established medical psychology as a separate and distinct healthcare profession and transferred the regulation of their practice of medical psychology to the Louisiana State Board of Medical Examiners. At this time, the entire practice of psychology (for medical psychologist), including psychotherapy and psychological testing, was also transferred to the Louisiana Board of Medical Examiners, effectively making Louisiana the only state in the U.S. where, for some psychologists, a medical board has authority over the regulation of the entire practice of psychology. Because of this, several national organizations, including the American Psychological Association and the Association of State and Provincial Psychology Boards have expressed concern over the practice of psychology being regulated by another profession (i.e., medicine). The Louisiana Psychological Association has strongly echoed such concerns. However, the Louisiana Academy of Medical Psychologists, a Political Action Committee representing medical psychologists in that state, strongly endorsed this change of regulation by another profession. Currently, prescribing rights for psychologists are negotiated in Canada, United Kingdom, and Australia. APA Guidelines In December 2011, the American Psychological Association (APA) published a list of practice guidelines that apply to all prescribing activities, with some also applicable to collaborating and information providing activities. The list is categorized according to the area of psychologists' involvement in pharmacological issues (general, education, assessment, intervention and consultation). The following list summarizes the guidelines by section.American Psychological Association (2011). Practice guidelines regarding psychologists' involvement in pharmacological issues. American psychologist, 66(9), 838-839. doi: 10.1037/a0025890 *General * Guidelines 1 through 3 encourage psychologists to act within the scope of their practice with regards to prescribing psychotropic medications, which includes seeking consultation before recommending certain medications; emphasize that psychologists' evaluate their own views and opinions towards prescribing medications in light of how it may affect communication with patients; and expect that psychologists involved in medication prescription or collaboration be wary of developmental, age, educational, sex, gender, language, health status, and cultural factors involved in populations a psychologist may serve, with regards to pharmacotherapy. *Education * Guidelines 4 through 6 require that psychologists attain a level of education specific to pharmacotherapy in order to serve their clients; expect that psychologists be wary of potential adverse side effects of psychotropic medications; and ask that psychologists that prescribe or collaborate with regards to medication prescription be aware of helpful technological resources that are available. *Assessment * Guidelines 7 through 9 require that psychologists familiarize themselves with procedures for monitoring the physiological and psychological effects of medications; expect that psychologists who prescribe medications consider other physiological disorders or underlying diseases that the patient may have that could affect the effectiveness of medications; and encourage psychologists to consider issues about patient adherence and concerns about medications. *Intervention and Consultation * Guidelines 10 through 15 require that psychologists employ a biopsychosocial approach when prescribing medications and that they also use informed consent procedures, act in the best interest of the patient, and consider current research; emphasize that psychologists be wary of commercial influences regarding medications; and encourage psychologists to consider the patient's interpersonal behaviors. *Relationships * Guidelines 16 and 17 expect that psychologists maintain appropriate relationships with other providers of psychological services and biological interventions.  Supporting arguments  There are several core arguments put forth by RxP advocates, including the following: * Other non- physicians have prescription privileges, such as pharmacists, optometrists, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants. Some advocates have asserted that the latter three professions receive less training in clinical pharmacology, therapeutics, and psychopharmacology than many clinical psychologists.Ericson, Robert. (2 September 2002). Prescription Privilege Based on Proven Model. Albuquerque Journal. Retrieved July 28, 2007. * The statistics point to multiple content areas in which other professions, such as psychiatric nurse practitioners, physicians are relatively deficient in comparison to pharmacologically trained psychologists‚Äô preparation.Muse, M., & McGrath, R. (2010). Training comparison among three professions prescribing psychoactive medications: psychiatric nurse practitioners, physicians, and pharmacologically trained psychologists. Journal of Clinical Psychology, 66(1), 96-103. doi:10.1002/jclp.20623. * The training model is supported by a complete lack of legal complaint after eight years regarding the practice of the initial ten psychologists trained by the U.S. Department of Defense. Legal complaints differ from legal suits, as military personnel cannot sue for redress.Feres v. United States * Access to medication would be improved in jurisdictions with long waiting times to see a psychiatrist or other qualified physician.Heiby, E., DeLeon, P., and Anderson, T. (2004). A Debate on Prescription Privileges for Psychologists. Professional Psychology: Research and Practice, 35(4), 336. * The prescriptive authority would be enhanced by the psychologist's doctoral training in the science of psychology, assessment, and psychotherapy. This training is more extensive than that received by the average physician. In addition, the training program for psychologists would provide twice as much pharmacology training than nurse practitioners and physician assistants receive. * It would address the fact that many lack access to psychiatrists (especially in rural areas).NAPPP. (2006). NAPPP Sponsors Prescriptive Authority Legislation. Retrieved July 28, 2007.King, Craig. (2006). Prescriptive Authority for Psychologists Working in the Public Sector: Is it Needed? Public Service Psychology, 31(1), 2. * It would create a clearer distinction between doctoral and master-level practitioners, and between doctoral and post-doctoral level practitioners.Medical psychology * In circumstances in which the psychologist decided not to collaborate with medical colleagues, it could allow the psychologist control of the entire treatment process. In some cases, this might reduce or eliminate complications arising from interprofessional collaboration and potentially save patients money. * Psychologists with prescriptive authority would add competence to the overall mental health system by adding a resource for general practitioners who need professional consultation regarding psychological disorders and psychotropic medications when a psychiatrist is unavailable.Holloway, Jennifer. (2004). Gaining prescriptive knowledge. Monitor on Psychology, 35(6), 22 * Psychopharmacological training allows psychologists to provide better advocacy for their clients. According to a survey assessing the views of psychology interns, residents, and psychologists published in the journal Professional Psychology: Research and Practice, significant support exists regarding the APA's prescriptive authority initiative. Proponents of the prescriptive authority initiative believe that it would improve the economic stability of the profession, provide better opportunities to underserved populations, and enhance psychologists' clinical skills through a better understanding of biopsychosocial interactions.Fagan, T.J., Ax, R.K, Liss, M., Resnick, R.J., Moody, S.. (2007). Prescriptive authority and preferences for training. Professional psychology: Research and practice, 38(1), 104-111. Support for the prescriptive authority initiative also appears higher amongst those with PsyDs and early career psychologists than those with PhDs and mid- and late-career psychologists. Demographically, females and Caucasians expressed more willingness to seek prescription privileges. Also, those who attended a clinical or counseling graduate program, received a PhD degree, and those employed in a university counseling center, medical school hospital, or independent practice tend to demonstrate higher levels of support for the initiative. In terms of training, an overwhelming majority of those surveyed believe training should begin at the graduate level, but prior to completion of a doctorate. Accordingly, in February 2019, the APA Council of Representatives overwhelmingly voted to approve changes to APA policy that allows psychopharmacology training to begin at the graduate level; previously, APA policy only allowed for this training to occur at the postdoctoral level. In Illinois, one of the jurisdictions where RxP is law, there are already psychopharmacology programs in place that offer this education and training at the predoctoral level. Additionally, respondents preferred that training occur on a part-time basis, be completed within two to two and a half years and cost $12,000-$18,000. Today, evidence exists to indicate a continual and growing level of support for the American Psychological Association's prescriptive authority initiative. Such support reflects psychologists' willingness to open their minds to learning about psychotropic medications, incorporating pharmacological treatment with therapy, and adapting to the demands of a rapidly changing health care world. Opposition Prescriptive authority for psychologists has been controversial, even within the healthcare community, which has created entire organizations dedicated to objecting to prescriptive authority for clinical psychologists. Specifically, critics within the medical profession have expressed concern that they have no medical training. The current RxP model explicitly states that this movement includes no medical training, but this can be accomplished with a master's degree in psychopharmacology, typically from a postdoctoral education program at a professional school. Some opponents claim this would culminate in substantially fewer years and hours compared to Physicians assistants and nurse practitioners, who are granted full prescriptive authority, and can elect to specialize in psychiatry, unlike the majority of psychologists. However, proponents have rebutted this assertion by describing their sequence of training (e.g., 4-year undergraduate degree, 5-year doctoral degree, 1-year internship, 1-year residency/fellowship, 2-year master's degree in psychopharmacology, national psychopharmacology exam, supervised clinical experience). In addition, survey research comparing prescribing psychology's training against that of nurse practitioners and physician assistants has demonstrated that when presented with un-labeled training programs side-by- side, prescribing psychologists' training is perceived to be more rigorous overall than that of psychiatric nurse practitioners or physicians' assistants in their ability prescribe psychiatric medicationCooper, R. R. (2019). Pulling Back the Political Curtain: Surveying Opinions and Biases on Prescribing Psychology's Training (Unpublished doctoral dissertation). University of the Cumberlands, Williamsburg, Kentucky. DOI: 10.13140/RG.2.2.26055.24480.. This perception was found to be true of physicians, mid-level providers, psychologists, non-prescribing therapists, and general members of the public. The strongest opposition to date has come from current psychiatrists who point out that psychologists (even after attending additional training) lack the proper general medical knowledge obtained in medical school and residency necessary to effectively and safely manage patients' care (while exposing any patient to undue risk).http://www.quackwatch.com/07PoliticalActivities/rxp1.html Some psychologists opposing prescriptive authority fear caseload pressures that might press increasing numbers of psychologists to respond to patients' needs via only one treatment modality (pharmacology), as do many psychiatrists.

Early life Palmer was a star pitcher for the Glens Falls High School Indians baseball team until he graduated in 1976. He pitched alongside fellow future Major League Baseball pitcher Dave LaPoint. Montreal Palmer was drafted by the Montreal Expos in the 21st round (489th overall) of the 1976 amateur entry draft. He pitched in the Expos organization until 1985. Although he made his major league debut in 1978, he pitched only a handful of minor league games in 1981 due to injuries, and had to fight his way back from Triple-A in 1982, where he made nine minor league starts. Additionally, he did not throw a single pitch in 1983 due to further injuries. On April 21, 1984, Palmer pitched an unusual moment in baseball history when he threw a five-inning perfect game in the second game of a doubleheader at Busch Stadium against the St. Louis Cardinals. Officials called the game on account of rain, and major-league baseball officials later struck the game from baseball's official list of perfect games since it only lasted five innings. He was granted free agency on November 12, 1985. Atlanta Palmer was signed by the Atlanta Braves on February 13, 1986, shortly before pitchers and catchers were to report to spring training. Having his best season statistically, Palmer was granted free agency on November 12, 1986. After testing the free agent waters for the second time in his career, Palmer decided to sign back with the Braves on December 19, 1986. However, his second season in Atlanta did not prove to duplicate his first, and he was granted free agency on November 9, 1987. Philadelphia Palmer was signed as a free agent by the Philadelphia Phillies on December 18, 1987. Although Palmer pitched reasonably well for the Phillies, he was released on October 13, 1988. Detroit and beyond Palmer was signed as a free agent by the Detroit Tigers on February 25, 1989, shortly before the exhibition season began in spring training. Although Palmer broke camp with the Tigers, he pitched poorly and was demoted after making five starts. After making 10 minor league starts, Palmer was released by the Detroit Tigers on July 13, 1989. On July 27, 1989 Palmer signed a minor league contract with the Cleveland Indians. Palmer finished the season in the minor leagues, and never pitched in the major leagues with the Indians. He was released on October 26, 1989. Personal life Palmer lives in the Atlanta area and was the pitching coach for Parkview High School, Gwinnett County, Georgia for a number of years.

By 2005 he had married and was living in Houston, Texas with his wife and children; they moved that year to Cairo, Egypt. The following year, they went to Somalia, where he joined Al-Shabaab with another American Muslim, Omar Hammami. The group is classified by United States law enforcement as a terrorist organization. After being captured by Kenyan forces in January 2007, Maldonado was turned over to United States officials and brought back to the US by agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). He was charged in a US District Court in February 2007 in Houston, Texas for receiving military training from a terrorist organization. In April 2007, Maldonado pleaded guilty to the charges. On July 20, 2007, he was sentenced to ten years in prison, with an additional three years of supervised release and a $1000 fine.\\"US Citizen Sentenced to Prison for Receiving Military Training from a Terrorist Organization\\", Press Release, 20 July 2007, FBI, Houston Field Division, accessed 15 January 2013 Early life and education Maldonado was born in Pelham, New Hampshire, to Jose and Rena Maldonado. He has an older brother Scott and sister Tamra, and younger brother Joshua.CINDY GEORGE and RACHEL GRAVES, \\"Terrorist suspect's unexpected journey to Houston jail\\", Houston Chronicle, 16 February 2007, accessed 15 January 2013 In 1995 as a freshman in high school, he was the only one to wear dreadlocks; friends said he liked attention in the suburban town. While remembered by teachers as bright and outspoken, he dropped out of high school before his junior year. Maldonado lived in other places in New Hampshire and Massachusetts, including Methuen. The Boston Globe reported that, as a youth, Maldonado had minor brushes with the law, but nothing serious. Marriage and family Maldonado started dating Tamekia Cunningham in high school. She dropped out of school and worked retail jobs, but got her GED. About a year after their son was born, they married and continued to live with his parents. Her mother Yolanda Cunningham lived in nearby Salem, New Hampshire. Tamekia also converted from Christianity to Islam and took to wearing full-length burqas to please her husband. Her mother said Tamekia wanted to share her husband's religion. They moved around New Hampshire and Massachusetts, where Maldonado had difficulty keeping work. Tamekia started a store for some Islamic goods. By 2005 the couple were living with their two children in Houston, Texas, where Maldonado worked for a computer company. In November 2005, Maldonado moved with his family from Houston to Cairo, Egypt, at the request of his boss, who thought costs would be lower there. His father said that Maldonado and his wife were seeking a more congenial community for Muslims. They had a total of three children together, the youngest likely born in the summer of 2006 while they were living in Egypt. There Maldonado met Omar Hammami, another American convert to Islam, through an online forum. Attraction to Somalia  In November 2006, the two men decided to go to Somalia where there was a struggle to set up an Islamic society by insurgents. According to statements that Maldonado gave to the FBI, he hoped to find an Islamic society, as he said he had not felt at home in Egypt. Maldonado took his family with him, installing his wife and children in the capital of Mogadishu. The United States supported the government, not the Islamic insurgents. Maldonado went on with Hammami to an Al-Shabaab training camp in southern Somalia, in Kismayo, where he contracted malaria. The Boston Globe reports that an FBI affidavit asserts Maldonado took training in Somalia in bomb-making and military skills, taught by Al Qaeda experts, among others. The family left Somalia with others, with the men and women traveling separately. His wife Tamekia was with their daughters and was described as dying after a high fever, likely due to malaria, shortly before the group reached Kenya in January 2007. She was buried immediately along the way. On January 21, 2007, Maldonado and his son were captured by Kenyan military authorities as he went over the border from Somalia, seeking to escape invasion by Ethiopian and other forces. By that time, he had his daughters with them, and the three children were with him briefly in jail. His multi-national interrogators included a police terrorist investigator from Houston. Kenya expelled Maldonado, turning him over to US officials. Special Agents of the FBI took custody and escorted him back to the United States, where he was kept in federal custody. US officials returned his three children to the care of their grandparents in New Hampshire. Maldonado's parents, now living in Londonderry, New Hampshire, have custody and Yolanda Cunningham sees the children frequently. In mid-February 2007 the United States federal government charged the 28-year-old Maldonado in Houston with getting military training from a terrorist organization in Somalia, including weapons, bomb-making and interrogation techniques. Maldonado is notable because his charge in a Houston, Texas federal court was the first time a US citizen has faced charges for participating in terrorism in Somalia. The FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III delivered a speech on March 28, 2007 at the National Defense University, in which he referred to Maldonado's fighting in Somalia and arrest: > ... such as the arrest of suspected terrorist Daniel Maldonado. Maldonado, > an American citizen who converted to the Muslim faith, moved from Houston to > Egypt in November 2005. He then traveled to Somalia to practice what he > called 'true Islam'. According to the indictment, while in Mogadishu, > Maldonado participated in a jihadist training program that included weapons > and explosives. He said that he was willing to fight on behalf of Al Qaeda > and even offered to act as a suicide bomber. Kenyan military authorities > captured Maldonado in January. Members of the Houston Joint Terrorism Task > Force transported him back to the United States. Rodwan Saleh, president of the Islamic Society of Greater Houston, said \\"the enthusiasm of recent converts can be exploited by some extreme groups.\\" He had not known Maldonado, but said that perhaps he had been attracted to the dark side of Islam. The case moved rapidly in the court. In April 2007, Maldonado pleaded guilty to receiving military training from Al-Shabaab. His conviction was due to work by the Joint Terrorism Task Force, with members from the FBI and the Houston Police Department. On July 20, 2007, the judge sentenced him to the statutory maximum of ten years in prison for the crime, with an additional three years of supervised release, and a $1000 fine.

Castle Irmelshausen is best known for its castle and related church. Irmelshausen, on the old border between East and West Germany, is one of the most appealing castles in this region of Germany (Franconia). Irmelshausen is first mentioned in the year 800 when Emhild, the Abbess of Milz and a relative of Charlemagne, gave the village to the Counts of Henneberg. In 1354, upon the marriage of Countess Elisabeth with the Count Eberhard of W√ºrttemberg, the village was sold to the Bishopric of W√ºrzburg. Twenty-two years later the bishopric transferred it to Berthold von Bibra. Since that time, it has been greatly enlarged and has been one of the main seats of the Bibra family. Parts of the castle were previously taller but during a remodeling in 1854 the half-timbered sections were lowered to the present height. Until recently it was the site of the Bibra family archives which were fortunately moved to Irmelshausen from Bibra prior to the German Peasants' War in 1524-25. The second seat of the von Bibra family, through diplomacy it escaped attack and destruction in both the Peasants' War of 1525 and the Thirty Years' War of 1618-48 when almost all the surrounding castles were taken and sacked. It is said that the first enemy soldier to enter the castle during World War II did so on April 8, 1945. The American Col. Vennard Wilson was served tea, noted the contents of the castle and ordered it off limits to troops. The castle itself, the two farms and the forest is owned by the Bibra family (older and younger lines) and the adopted daughter of the Bibra family who is by birth a Guttenberg and by marriage a Stauffenberg. Besides the five-sided castle, the late Gothic church with its numerous and beautiful Bibra gravestones from the 16th and 17th centuries is worth visiting.

Over his career, Suzuki played 18 seasons in professional baseball, including six in Major League Baseball and two in the Japan Pacific League. In his major league career, he has played for the Seattle Mariners (1996, 1998‚Äì1999), the Kansas City Royals (1999‚Äì2001, 2002), the Colorado Rockies (2001), and the Milwaukee Brewers (2001). With those teams, he has had a combined record of 16‚Äì31 with a 5.72 earned run average (ERA), one complete game, one shutout, and 327 strikeouts in 117 games, 67 starts. Early life At the age of 16, Suzuki was sent away from his home by his parents after getting expelled from high school. He then got a job with the Salinas Spurs, an unaffiliated club in the California League based in Salinas, California. With the Spurs, Suzuki pitched the final game of the season in 1992, after he spent the entire season as their laundry boy. The next season, Suzuki became a full-time player for the San Bernardino Spirit. Suzuki later stated that his parents were proud of him for learning the English language and how much he matured after he was sent away. Professional career =Seattle Mariners= Suzuki pitched for the non- affiliated Class-A San Bernardino in 1993, going 4‚Äì4 with a 3.68 earned run average (ERA), 12 saves, and 87 strikeouts in 48 games, one start. He led the Spirit in saves that season. Suzuki signed with the Seattle Mariners in 1993, choosing Seattle over a list of suitors including the Toronto Blue Jays. In his first season in affiliated professional baseball in 1994, Suzuki pitched for the Double-A Jacksonville Suns of the Southern League. In eight games, he went 1‚Äì0 with a 2.84 ERA, one save, and 10 strikeouts. Suzuki was sidelined that season due to a shoulder injury. After an earthquake hit his home town on Kobe, Japan, Suzuki returned to care for his family during the off-season before the 1995 season. During spring training in 1995, Suzuki was again plagued by shoulder injuries. He split the season between the rookie-league AZL Mariners and the Class-A Advanced Riverside Pilots. In ten combined games in the minors, Suzuki went 1‚Äì1 with a 5.40 ERA, and nine strikeouts. Suzuki was promoted to the majors in 1995, however, he did not play. He made his major league debut on July 7, , becoming the third Japanese player to play in the major leagues, after Masanori Murakami and Hideo Nomo, and the first Japanese player to pitch in the American League. He was sent back to the minors shortly afterwards, but marked his first major league win in . =Later career= He was sent briefly to the New York Mets in June, , before being shipped away again to the Kansas City Royals. He won 8 games in , including one shut-out victory. He went to the Colorado Rockies, then to the Milwaukee Brewers, before returning to the Royals again. He did not win a game in , and was released by the Royals. He announced his decision to enter the Japanese professional leagues at the end of the season. According to regulations, Suzuki still needed to be picked in the draft to join a Japanese team. The Yakult Swallows had originally intended to choose him, but the Orix BlueWave forcefully picked Suzuki in the 2nd round, and he ended up joining the Blue Wave. There was debate about whether Suzuki qualified for the Japanese rookie of the year award, since he had already played in the major leagues. The league granted him the qualification, but Suzuki rejected it, perhaps due to his pride as a former major leaguer. In the end, the debate proved meaningless, as Suzuki won only 4 games that year, and in August, , he could not get a single out in a game against the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks, where his team lost 1-29. He pitched horrendously against the Hawks in 2003, giving up 32 runs in only 6 games. In , he started only 5 games (none of which were against the Hawks), all of which he failed to get past the 5th inning. His only win that year came against the Osaka Kintetsu Buffaloes, where he won despite giving up 5 runs over 5 innings. He did not pitch at all in , and was cut from the team during the off-season. Suzuki returned to the United States, and signed a minor league contract with the Oakland Athletics in December, 2005. He pitched poorly in spring training, and did not make the major league team. He joined a Mexican League team (Tabasco Olmecs) in , and signed a minor league deal with the Chicago Cubs in the 2006 off-season. In 2009, he played for the Southern Maryland Blue Crabs of the independent Atlantic Professional Baseball League. In 2010, he signed with the Calgary Vipers of the Golden Baseball League. In 2011 Suzuki was announced as an instructor for the California Winter League (CWL) located in Palm Springs, Ca. He is currently involved with Japanese Independent baseball and was also a player in the CWL in the 2010 season.

William M. Wood (June 18, 1858 ‚Äì February 2, 1926) was an American textile mill owner of Lawrence, Massachusetts who was considered to be an expert in efficiency. He made a good deal of his fortune through being hired by mill owners to turn around failing mills and was despised by organized labor.  Early life  William Wood was born in 1858 in a cottage on Pease Point Way, in Edgartown, Massachusetts, on the island of Martha's Vineyard. His parents, Grace (Emma) Wood and William Wood Sr., were Portuguese immigrants from the Azores. His father, William Sr., Guilherme Medeiros Silva was a crewman on a New Bedford whaling ship from 1853 until his death in 1871. William Jr. was only 12 years old when his father died, and had to drop out of school and find a job to provide for his mother and younger siblings. Fortunately for William Wood, a wealthy New Bedford textile manufacturer named Andrew Pierce offered him a job working in his Wamsutta Cotton Mill. Pierce would soon see that hiring young William would prove to be extremely beneficial. Pierce was impressed with Wood's work and promoted him to the manufacturing department, where he learned cost structures and figures. At the age of eighteen, Wood left New Bedford for Philadelphia. With the help of Andrew Pierce, William was able to find a good job with a Philadelphia brokerage firm. This is where he learned about stocks and bonds. After tiring of Philadelphia, he returned to New Bedford and worked at a bank. According to the Dukes County Intelligencer, when a Fall River textile company went bankrupt, its new manager hired William as paymaster. Then in 1885, the Washington Mill in Lawrence went bankrupt and was purchased by Frederick Ayer of Lowell. Frederick Ayer and his brother James Cook Ayer were successful patent medicine producers.Mills, Mansions, and Mergers: The Life of William M. Wood. By Edward G. Roddy. North Andover, Mass., Merrimack Valley Textile Museum, 1982  American Woolen Company  Wood Mill, Lawrence, named for William. Ayer was a multi-millionaire but knew nothing about the textile industry. This is when Ayer's new manager convinced Wood to leave his previous position and be his assistant in charge of manufacturing. A short time later, Wood was promoted to treasurer, and four years later he was made manager. Wood was then making a substantial amount of money for the time, around $25,000 a year. Within three years of his promotion, William Wood married Ayer's daughter Ellen (eventually making him a brother-in-law to General George S. Patton). Ellen was well educated; she studied at a finishing school in France and then attended Radcliffe College in Cambridge, MA. Wood was determined to make the Washington Mill a success for himself and his newly acquired family. Wood did make the Washington Mill a success and decided to move on to bigger goals. He set out to merge some of the small, struggling mills of New England into one mammoth money-making company, his company. By 1899, William Wood had convinced seven such mills to join what he called \\"The Woolen Trust.\\" In April of that same year the company was incorporated under a new name the, \\"American Woolen Company.\\" Frederick Ayer bought half of the shares, and Wood purchased the rest.Mills, Mansions, and Mergers: The Life of William M. Wood. By Edward G. Roddy. North Andover, Mass., Merrimack Valley Textile Museum, 1982  Lawrence textile strike  In 1912, the Lawrence Mill workers, organized and backed by the union, IWW, went on strike. William Wood was required to shorten the work week for all employees. He did cut the work week from fifty-six hours to fifty-four hours, but he also increased the speed at which the looms ran in order to keep from losing profits. The workers were angry that they were working just as hard and producing just as much as they would in a fifty-six- hour week, but only getting paid for fifty-four hours. During the strike, the police found explosives in three different places along the mills. Meanwhile, Wood settled with the strikers, giving them time and a quarter for overtime and thirty cents more a week to piece-workers. The problem was solved for the moment, but the authorities were looking into the explosives. Eventually, by tracing the serial numbers on the dynamite, the authorities received a confession from the mill contractor, Ernest Pittman. He told them that he and another man, John Breen, had planted the explosives to implicate the IWW. Since they were both employed by William Wood, Wood was indicted for conspiracy to destroy the mills. After a long trial, the grand jury found William Wood not guilty on June 6, 1913.  Later in life  Moving on with his life, William made big plans for his company's headquarters at Shawsheen Village, Massachusetts. This meant moving from the previous location in Lawrence. The entire project took about five years from 1918 to 1923. Wood transformed a quiet residential community into a self-sufficient neighborhood for his employees; it included industrial, residential and recreational facilities. During those years, the First World War kept the woolen industry alive. Wood was swamped with Army contracts that helped his company grow. By 1924, the company owned sixty mills and employed over 40,000 people. In 1924, William Wood suffered a stroke. His doctor advised him to retire and rest. Taking his doctors advice, William Wood retired and named Andrew Pierce Jr. his successor. Pierce Jr. was the son of the man who gave Wood his first job. In January 1926, he and his wife Ellen moved to Florida. On February 2, 1926 William Wood had his chauffeur take him for a drive. Once they were on a deserted road, he got out of the car, walked out of his driver's sight, pulled out his revolver, placed it in his mouth, pulled the trigger, and ended his own life. After Wood's death, his fortune became the subject of a major U.S. Supreme Court decision on the interpretation of the income tax laws. In the case of Old Colony Trust Co. v. Commissioner, 279 U.S. 716 (1929), Chief Justice William Howard Taft held that where a third party (in this case, American Woolen Co.) pays the income tax owed by an individual, the amount of tax paid constitutes additional taxable income to that individual. The executors of his will therefore had to pay the back taxes on his estate.  Sports owner  Wood owned the Shawsheen Indians which won the 1924‚Äì25 National Challenge Cup. In June 1925, the Indians entered the American Soccer League. Following Wood's death, the Indians withdrew from the league and folded.

Following his major league career, he played for three seasons with the Orix BlueWave in Japan. Career Fraser grew up a New York Yankees fan in Newburgh, New York and graduated from Newburgh Free Academy in 1982. He played college baseball in NCAA Division II at Concordia College in Bronxville, New York where he developed a forkball which drew comparisons to future Hall of Famer Bruce Sutter's. The California Angels selected him with the fifteenth pick in the 1985 MLB draft, ahead of future Hall of Famers Randy Johnson and John Smoltz. He was assigned to the Quad Cities Angels of the Midwest League to begin his professional career. Fraser made his Major League debut in a start with the Angels on September 10, 1986 at Cleveland Stadium against the Indians. It was his only Major League appearance that year. Blyleven spent most of the next two seasons in the starting rotation but was moved to the bullpen after the Angels traded for future Hall of Fame pitcher Bert Blyleven following the 1988 season.

Bush signs the Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act, June 22, 2004 The Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act (LEOSA) is a United States federal law, enacted in 2004, that allows two classes of persons‚Äîthe \\"qualified law enforcement officer\\" and the \\"qualified retired or separated law enforcement officer\\"‚Äîto carry a concealed firearm in any jurisdiction in the United States, regardless of state or local laws, with certain exceptions. LEOSA is often incorrectly referred to as \\"H.R. 218\\". The act was introduced during the 108th Congress as H.R. 218 and enacted as Public Law 108-277. The law was later amended by the Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act Improvements Act of 2010 (S. 1132, Public Law 111-272), and Section 1099C of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 (H.R. 4310, Public Law 112-239). It is codified within the provisions of the Gun Control Act of 1968 as 18 USC ¬ß 926BTitle 18 of the United States Code ¬ß 926B - Carrying Of Concealed Firearms By Qualified Law Enforcement Officers\\". Cornell University Law School. Retrieved January 15, 2014 and USC ¬ß 926C.\\"Title 18 of the United States Code ¬ß 926C - Carrying Of Concealed Firearms By Qualified Retired Law Enforcement Officers\\". Cornell University Law School. Retrieved January 15, 2014 The law and its amendments Whether or not a person is privileged by the Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act (LEOSA) of 2004 and its amendments in 2010 and 2013 to carry a concealed firearm depends on whether or not he or she meets the federal definitions for either a \\"qualified law enforcement officer\\" or a \\"qualified retired law enforcement officer.\\" If a person meets the criteria, then \\"notwithstanding any other provision of the law of any State or any political subdivision thereof\\", he or she may carry a concealed firearm that has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce, in any state or political subdivision thereof.See Title 18, USC, Section 921, which defines \\"state\\" to also include the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and U.S. possessions. As a result, an individual who qualifies under LEOSA does not require a state-issued permit for carrying a concealed firearm in any state, including that person's home state. This is because LEOSA, by its terms, provides in its introductory paragraphs (Sections 926B(a) and Section 926C(a)) that notwithstanding the law of \\"any State\\" a person who qualifies under LEOSA is not subject to the concealed carry laws of any state. Some officials, such as in New Jersey, believe that a retired officer residing in NJ must still obtain a state issued permithttp://www.njsp.org/about/fire_ret.html#instruct in order to be eligible to carry a firearm under LEOSA, in effect nullifying LEOSA. However, that view assumes New Jersey law is not preempted by LEOSA and has no support in the LEOSA statute itself, by its terms, or in any published court case to date. Furthermore, LEOSA's legislative history indicates that its framers intended LEOSA to supersede all states' laws, including the home state of the individual claiming its exemption. For example, Congress declared LEOSA's purpose was to implement \\"national measures of uniformity and consistency\\" and allow officers to carry a concealed firearm \\"anywhere within the United States.\\"H.R. Rep. 108-560 at p. 4. In addition, Congress rejected efforts to allow states to opt out of LEOSA.H.R. Rep. 108-560 at pp. 7-8, 29-37; Sen. Rep. 108-29 at p.7 The House of Representatives also defeated-- and the Senate refused to consider-- proposed amendments aimed at preserving local law enforcement agencies' discretion to regulate \\"the conditions under which their officers may carry firearms.\\"H.R. Rep. 108-560 at pp. 8-9, 37-45, Sen. Rep. 108-29 at pp. 6-7 Thus, both the words of LEOSA and its legislative intent clearly establish that LEOSA applies nationwide, including the home state of the individual. The privilege specifically does not extend to machine guns, destructive devices, or suppressors. LEOSA covers state and public university and/or college campus law enforcement officers, however this law does not necessarily cover private campus police or company police. Although LEOSA preempts state and local laws, there are two notable exceptions: \\"the laws of any State that (1) permit private persons or entities to prohibit or restrict the possession of concealed firearms on their property\\" (such as a bars, private clubs, amusement parks, etc.), or \\"(2) prohibit or restrict the possession of firearms on any State or local government property, installation, building, base, or park\\" Additionally, LEOSA does not override the federal Gun-Free School Zone Act (GFSZA) which prohibits carrying a firearm within 1,000 feet of elementary or secondary schools unless the individual possessing the firearm is licensed to do so by the State in which the school zone is located or a political subdivision of the State. Although the GFSZA authorizes on-duty law enforcement officers to carry firearms in such circumstances, off-duty and retired law enforcement officers are still restricted from doing so unless they have a firearms license issued from the state in which they reside and then it is only good for the state in which they reside. Individuals must also obey any federal laws and federal agency policies that restrict the carrying of concealed firearms in certain federal buildings and lands, as well as federal regulations prohibiting the carriage of firearms on airplanes. Debate has continued over the effect and scope of policies issued by individual law enforcement agencies in relation to their own employees, where such policies would appear to restrict the ability of a law enforcement officer to carry a firearm. Some argue that the law does not override the internal policies of a department or agency. However, when LEOSA was under consideration in the United States House of Representatives Committee on the Judiciary, considerable representations were made to the effect that it would override agency-specific policies, leading to opposition to the Act from the International Association of Chiefs of Police, the Police Executive Research Forum, and the United States Conference of Mayors, which was expressed as a dissenting view in the report of the Committee. Congressman Bobby Scott (D-VA) proposed an amendment to the Bill to provide that it \\"shall not be construed to supersede or limit the rules, regulations, policies, or practices of any State or local law enforcement agency,\\" but this amendment was opposed by the sponsors of the bill, and was rejected by the Committee 21-11, so the enacted law contains no such exception. In his dissent to the passage of LEOSA, Senator Edward M. Kennedy acknowledged that LEOSA overrides agency policy in accordance with United States Supreme Court precedent: \\"The bill removes the ability of police departments to enforce rules and policies on when and how their own officers can carry firearms. Police chiefs will lose the authority to prohibit their own officers from carrying certain weapons on- duty or off-duty. Section 2 of the bill provides that regardless of any other provision of the law of any State or any political subdivision thereof, any individual who qualifies as a law enforcement officer and who carries photo identification will be authorized to carry any firearm. In a variety of contexts, including the federal preemption of state law, courts have interpreted the term law to include agency rules and regulations. The Supreme Court has ruled that this term specifically includes contractual obligations between employers and employees, such as work rules, policies, and practices promulgated by state and local police departments.Norfolk & Western Ry. Co. v. Am. Train Dispatchers' Assoc., 499 U.S. 117 (1991).\\" Senate Report No. 108-29 at page 17 =2010 amendment= In 2010, LEOSA was amended by the Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act Improvements Act of 2010, which specifically extended coverage to include law enforcement officers of the Amtrak Police, Federal Reserve Police, and law enforcement officers of the executive branch of the Federal Government. The provisions for disqualification on mental health grounds and the provisions regarding qualifications to carry a firearm were amended, and the number of aggregate years for retired officers was reduced from fifteen to ten. In addition the definition of a firearm was expanded to include any ammunition not prohibited by the National Firearms Act of 1934. This was done to exempt qualified active and retired law enforcement officers from the prohibitions against carrying hollow-point ammunition that is in force in New Jersey (except for their peace officers and active federal law enforcement officers) and a few other locations. The concept of \\"retirement\\" was replaced with \\"separated from service\\" and the requirement that the retired officer have a nonforfeitable right to retirement benefits was eliminated. =2013 amendment= In 2013, LEOSA was again amended by the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2013, effective January 2, 2013, after President Obama signed Public Law 112-239 (H.R. 4310). Section 1089 of the NDAA contained language which further clarified that military police officers and civilian police officers employed by the U.S. Government unambiguously met the definitions in the original Act. The definitions of \\"qualified active\\" and \\"qualified retired\\" law enforcement officer include the term \\"police officers\\" and expanded the powers of arrest requirement definition to include those who have or had the authority to \\"apprehend\\" suspects under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Senator Patrick Leahy, a key sponsor of the bill, remarked \\"The Senate has agreed to extend that trust to the law enforcement officers that serve within our military. They are no less deserving or worthy of this privilege and I am very pleased we have acted to equalize their treatment under the federal law\\". He further stated \\"The amendment we adopt today will place military police and civilian police officers within the Department of Defense on equal footing with their law enforcement counterparts across the country when it comes to coverage under LEOSA.\\"url=http://www.leahy.senate.gov/press/leahy-hails- senate-action-on-law-enforcement-amendment Qualified law enforcement officers In 18 USC ¬ß 926B(c), \\"qualified law enforcement officer\\" is defined as any individual employed by a governmental agency, who: # is authorized by law to engage in or supervise the prevention, detection, investigation, or prosecution of, or the incarceration of any person for, any violation of law, has statutory powers of arrest, or apprehension under section 807(b) of title 10, United States Code (article 7(b) of the Uniform Code of Military Justice); This includes state and public college/university police officers. # is authorized by the agency to carry a firearm; # is not the subject of any disciplinary action by the agency which could result in suspension or loss of police powers; # meets standards, if any, established by the agency which require the employee to regularly qualify in the use of a firearm; # is not under the influence of alcohol or another intoxicating or hallucinatory drug or substance; and # is not prohibited by Federal law from receiving a firearm. Additionally, 18 USC ¬ß 926B requires that the individual must carry photographic identification issued by the governmental agency for which the individual is employed that identifies the employee as a police officer or law enforcement officer of the agency. Leosa also does not require a \\"qualified law enforcement officer\\" to be full-time, meaning that part-time, reserve, and auxiliary officers are viewed the same in the law's application, provided that while on-duty or called to service they meet the requirements, even if inactive at the time.Rene, James M., \\"Officer Safety and California Reserve Peace Officers: The Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act and California Assembly Bill 703.\\" Retrieved 10-26-13Rene, James M., and Ekerling, Howard L., \\"The Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act of 2004 And Its Application to California Reserve Peace Officers.\\" Retrieved 04-27-2013Rene, James M., \\"California Reserve Peace Officers and 'Legal Status' Under The Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act of 2004.\\" Qualified retired law enforcement officers In 18 USC ¬ß 926C(c), \\"qualified retired law enforcement officer\\" is defined as an individual who: # separated from service in good standing from service with a public agency as a law enforcement officer; # before such separation, was authorized by law to engage in or supervise the prevention, detection, investigation, or prosecution of, or the incarceration of any person for, any violation of law, and had statutory powers of arrest or apprehension under section 807(b) of title 10, United States Code (article 7(b) of the Uniform Code of Military Justice); # before such separation, served as a law enforcement officer for an aggregate of 10 years or more; or separated from service with such agency, after completing any applicable probationary period of such service, due to a service-connected disability, as determined by such agency; # during the most recent 12-month period, has met, at the expense of the individual, the standards for qualification in firearms training for active law enforcement officers, as determined by the former agency of the individual, the State in which the individual resides or, if the State has not established such standards, either a law enforcement agency within the State in which the individual resides or the standards used by a certified firearms instructor that is qualified to conduct a firearms qualification test for active duty officers within that State; # has not been officially found by a qualified medical professional employed by the agency to be unqualified for reasons relating to mental health and as a result of this finding will not be issued photographic identification; or has not entered into an agreement with the agency from which the individual is separating from service in which that individual acknowledges he or she is not qualified under this section for reasons relating to mental health and for those reasons will not receive or accept photographic identification; # is not under the influence of alcohol or another intoxicating or hallucinatory drug or substance; and # is not prohibited by Federal law from receiving a firearm. Additionally, the individual must carry either: :* photographic identification issued by the agency from which the individual separated from service as a law enforcement officer that identifies the person as having been employed as a police officer or law enforcement officer and indicates that the individual has, not less recently than one year before the date the individual is carrying the concealed firearm, been tested or otherwise found by the agency to meet the active duty standards for qualification in firearms training as established by the agency to carry a firearm of the same type as the concealed firearm; or :* photographic identification issued by the agency from which the individual separated from service as a law enforcement officer that identifies the person as having been employed as a police officer or law enforcement officer; and a certification issued by the State in which the individual resides or by a certified firearms instructor that is qualified to conduct a firearms qualification test for active duty officers within that State that indicates that the individual has, not less than one year before the date the individual is carrying the concealed firearm, been tested or otherwise found by the State or a certified firearms instructor that is qualified to conduct a firearms qualification test for active duty officers within that State to have met the active duty standards for qualification in firearms training, as established by the State, to carry a firearm of the same type as the concealed firearm; or if the State has not established such standards, standards set by any law enforcement agency within that State to carry a firearm of the same type as the concealed firearm. Case law The first known criminal prosecution against an individual asserting concealed carry privileges under LEOSA occurred in New York in People v. Rodriguez, Indictment No. 2917 (2006). Rodriguez was a full-time construction worker who was also employed as a Pennsylvania State Constable. He was arrested in New York City for criminal possession of a weapon. He testified in a hearing that he was authorized, qualified, and certified to carry a weapon in his state as a constable. The Court took judicial notice of the various Pennsylvania statutes that authorize constables to carry firearms, make arrests, serve process, and enforce the law. Upon applying LEOSA in terms of the known facts, the Court dismissed the charge against Rodriguez and held that he was covered by section 926B though constables are elected law enforcement officers and they lack government funding. A number of other courts have held that Coast Guard boarding officers are qualified under LEOSA. In People against Benjamin L. Booth, Jr., Indictment No. 2007-940 (2007), a county court in Orange County, New York, dismissed a criminal charge against Booth, an off-duty member of the Coast Guard, who had been arrested for carrying a loaded handgun in a vehicle. The court held that Booth was authorized to carry a firearm while acting as a Coast Guard boarding officer, adding, \\"Although the proof at the hearing indicates that the defendant engaged in a violation of rules, regulations and policies of the United States Coast Guard by possessing a handgun for which he had no license, these violations do not act to lessen the scope of LEOSA as it is applied in this instance.\\" Another Coast Guardsman, Reserve Petty Officer Jose Diaz, was arrested for carrying an unloaded handgun in a vehicle in San Fernando, California, in November 2007, but the charge was later dismissed and Diaz won a $44,000 settlement from the city for false arrest. The Coast Guard has issued a formal directive to advise Coast Guard personnel of which Coast Guard personnel are considered to be covered by LEOSA, and the limitations of such coverage. On June 3, 2016 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Washington D.C. Circuit ruled (in a 2-1 decision) that a case brought by Ronald Duberry would be remanded for further proceedings. The court ruled that Washington D.C.'s Department of Corrections could not keep retired officers from carrying concealed firearms, saying the 2004 Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act guaranteed that right. The court rejected the city's argument that the law does not apply to corrections officers. The city had cited the fact that the officers did not have full statutory powers of arrest during their time of employment. The court held that only some statutory power of arrest or apprehension was required (such as the power to take parole violators into custody). In the opinion for the court filed by Circuit Judge Rogers, the court said, \\" In the LEOSA, Congress defined \\"qualified law enforcement officers\\" broadly, to include individuals who engage in or supervise incarceration. Given the breadth of Congress's definition, the reference to \\"statutory powers of arrest\\" necessarily means some statutory power of arrest such as a power to arrest parole violators, and not, as the District of Columbia suggests, only the police power to arrest upon probable cause, see Appellee's Br. 25.\\" Alleged abuses Because of LEOSA's national application but reliance on local certification and standards, it has been alleged that the law has been used as a way for wealthy, unqualified civilians, who may live in states where the ability to concealed carry by civilians is not allowed or difficult to obtain, to use their financial or political ties to bypass local laws by donating time and money to a local jurisdiction and, in return, become an auxiliary or reserve officer. Among those alleged to have participated such schemes include individuals such as Robert Mercer, Steven Seagal, and Dan Bilzerian, and police departments of communities like Hudspeth County, Texas, Oakley, Michigan and Lake Arthur, New Mexico, which shutdown its police department in 2018 as a result of its practice of selling badges was exposed. LEOSA policy The adoption of a LEOSA policy by law enforcement agencies is a best practice which serves to provide clarity to LEOSA protocols and procedures and give certainty and guidance to agencies and their active and separated law enforcement officers who carry a firearm under LEOSA. Current law enforcement officers who invoke LEOSA to carry a firearm out of State, as well as separated law enforcement officers no matter where they carry, do so in their capacities as private persons with no law enforcement authority whatsoever. A policy clarifies the roles and responsibilities (as well as liability) of both agencies and their current and separated officers.

It is located in the Lower Galilee in the Northern District, within Sakhnin valley, adjacent to Sakhnin and Deir Hanna, and climbing a bit on Yodfat range to its south, while also owning some lands south of that in the Beit Netofa Valley (Sahl al-Battuf) to the north of Nazareth area. Arraba attained local council status in 1965, and city status in 2016. In its population was . Economy The symbol of the local council is an onion, a watermelon and a cantaloupe which symbolize the crops for which Arraba is famous. Throughout history Arraba was mostly an agricultural village depending mainly on the al- Batuf Plain (Hebrew name: Beit Netofa Valley) to grow crops. However, currently the dependence on agriculture is declining rapidly due to the rise in population, urbanization and a subsequently more modern lifestyle. History =Antiquity= Arraba is associated with the Jewish village called Arab, mentioned in Josephus' writings by its pronunciation in the Greek, Gabara,J.

(Hebrew) In the 5th or 6th century CE there were Christians living here, as witnessed by a church whose mosaic floor and inscription have been unearthed.Dauphin, 1998, p. 715 The oldest settled section of Arraba lies at the village's south-east side, near the Christian church. Archaeological artefacts have been discovered there dating back to the Roman and Byzantine periods.Zaharoni (1978), vol. 3, p. 114 Hanina ben Dosa is buried in Arraba.Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, p. 206 =Middle Ages= In the Crusader era, it was known as Arabiam.Frankel, 1979, p. 255 In 1174 it was one of the casalia (villages) given to Phillipe le Rous.Strehlke, 1869, p. 8, No. 7; cited in R√∂hricht, 1893, RHH, p. 137, No. 517; cited in Ellenblum, 2003, p. 109, note 16 and Frankel, 1988, p. 255 In 1236 descendants of Phillipe le Rous confirmed the sale of the fief of Arraba.Strehlke, 1869, p. 64, No.81; cited R√∂hricht, 1893, RHH, p. 269, No. 1069; cited in Frankel, 1988, p. 265 In 1250 it was one of the casalia belonging to the Teutonic knights, a Crusader order. In the 13th century Arrabah is mentioned by Syria geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi in his famous work Mu'jam al-BuldƒÅn (1224‚Äì1228), as a \\"place in the province of Acca\\".Le Strange, 1890, p. 399Sa'd Sabbagh, Biladuna Filasteen, Vol. 11 =Ottoman era= The village was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517 with all of Palestine, and in 1596 Arraba appeared in the tax registers as being in the Nahiya (\\"Subdistrict\\") of Tabariyya, part of Sanjak Safad. It had an all Muslim population of 125 households and 2 bachelors. The villagers paid a fixed tax rate of 20% on wheat, barley, summer crops or fruit trees, cotton, and goats or beehives; a total of 11,720 ak√ße. 1/4 of the revenue went to a waqf.H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 187Note that Rhode, 1979, p. 6 writes that the Safad register that H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah studied was not from 1595/6, but from 1548/9 At some point in the mid-17th century the Zayadina, an Arab Muslim tribe, immigrated to Arraba. Its sheikh (\\"chief\\") later acquired control of the town and its district after wresting control of the area from the Druze sheikh of Sallama. Sallama and other Druze villages in the vicinity were subsequently destroyed, Druze suzerainty over the Shaghur district came to an end and the Zayadina consequently gained significant influence in the area, including the role of tax collector of Shaghur on behalf of the Ottoman wali (\\"governor\\") of Sidon Province.Firro, 1992, p. 45 Arraba became home to Zahir al-Umar, a later sheikh of the Zayadina tribe. According to local legend, he sought refuge there after killing a Turkish soldier. He won the support of the local sheikh, Muhammad Nasser, by helping him settle a score with a neighboring village, which set off a series of campaigns that led to the conquest of the entire Galilee. A building said to be the home of Zahir is still standing. In 1838, Arabeh was noted as a Muslim and Christian village in the Esh-Shagur district, located between Safad, Acca and Tiberias.Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol. 3, 2nd appendix, p. 133 In 1875 Victor Gu√©rin found Arrabah to have 900 Muslim inhabitants and 100 Greek-Orthodox Christians.Gu√©rin, 1880, pp. 466-468 In 1881, the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine (SWP) described Arrabet al Buttauf as \\"A large stone-built village, containing about 1,000 Moslems and Christians, and surrounded by groves of olives and arable land. Water is obtained from a large birkeh and cisterns. This was the place where Dhaher el Amr¬¥s family was founded, and was long occupied by them.\\"Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, p. 364 A population list from about 1887 showed that Arrabet had 970 inhabitants; about 80% Muslim and 20% Catholic Christians.Schumacher, 1888, p. 173 =British Mandate era= Arraba 1947 from Palmach archives In the 1922 census of Palestine, conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Arrabeh had a population of 984, 937 Muslim and 47 Christian,Barron, 1923, Table XI, Sub-district of Acre, p. 37 of the Christians, 42 were Melkite, 4 Orthodox and one was Anglican.Barron, 1923, Table XVI, p. 50 At the time of the 1931 census, Arraba had 253 occupied houses and a population of 1187 Muslims and 37 Christians.Mills, 1932, p. 99 In the 1945 statistics the population was 1,800; 1,740 Muslims and 60 Christians,Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics, 1945, p. 4 with 30,852 dunams of land, according to an official land and population survey.Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics.

Many of the inhabitants fled but some remained.Morris, 1987, p. 226 The village remained under Martial Law until 1966. Arraba was home to the first Land Day demonstrations in 1976 demanding the state of Israel to stop the expropriation of Palestinian Arab lands. Together with Sakhnin and Deir Hanna it formed what is called the triangle of Land Day. Israel's reaction to control the protest was forceful and six people were killed by Israeli police. The reason for the Land Day follows: On March 11, 1976, the Israeli government published an expropriation plan including lands in the Galilee. It affected some 20,000 dunams of land between the Arab villages of Sakhnin and Arraba.Endelman, Todd M. Comparing Jewish societies University of Michigan Press, 1997; p. 292. , 9780472065929 The land was said to be used for security purposes, but was also used to build new Jewish settlements. David McDowall identifies the resumption of land seizures in the Galilee and the acceleration of land expropriations in the West Bank in the mid-1970s as the immediate catalyst for both the Land Day demonstration and similar demonstrations that were taking place contemporaneously in the West Bank. He writes: \\"Nothing served to bring the two Palestinian communities together politically more than the question of land.\\"McDowall, David (1990).

Architecture In the 1870s Guerin saw the mosque which he thought had probably once been a church on the basis of its east-west orientation. Inside there were two monolithic columns which he took as further proof of its antiquity. Andrew Petersen, an archaeologist specializing in Islamic architecture, surveyed the place in 1994, and found several interesting buildings.Petersen, 2001, p. 95 The modern-day mosque was built in 1953 on the site of an older building. Opposite the mosque is a palatial house with an ablaq entrance made of black and white masonry.

The Grand Floral Parade is held in Pierce County, Washington every April. It consists of a flower parade and a year-long royalty program to select a festival queen from one of the 23 area high schools. Each year, the Royal Court spend thousands of hours promoting education, community pride and volunteerism in the county. In 2012, the Royal Court was named the \\"Official Ambassadors of Pierce County\\" by the County Executive and the Pierce County Council.Pierce County Council Resolution - Proclamation No. R2012-3 History The Daffodil Festival came into existence because of the bulb industry between 1922 and 1925. It followed a severe infestation of ‚Äòhop lice‚Äô that destroyed the area‚Äôs hop crops and Prohibition. The US Department of Agriculture recommended bulb planting to Valley growers because of the mildness of the climate and ideal soil conditions. The climate conditions of the Puyallup River Valley produce blooms about 2-3 weeks earlier than other areas, in plenty of time for the mid winter markets. The area quickly became the nations ‚Äòbulb basket‚Äô producing 50% of the nations daffodil bulbs, over 50% of its bulb iris and 80% of the nations tulips. About 300 of the 12,000 varieties of daffodils were grown in the Valley. The most popular and most locally grown is the King Alfred. Between 1928 and 1933 a Bulb Sunday and bulb banquet were held. Mr. and Mrs. Charles W. Orton hosted civic leaders from 15 towns in western Washington in 1926. In 1927 the Sumner Chamber of Commerce sponsored the first Bulb Banquet. Free daffodils were given away to visitors. The roads became increasingly congested each year as people drove out to see the colorful fields. Reaching a peak of 30,000 vehicles. A local photographer Lee Merrill suggested a parade be held to ‚Äú take the daffodils to the people‚Äù. He organized the first event in 1934, this was the first festival as we know it today. Lee decided every festival needs a queen so as he was driving through Puyallup he saw a pretty girl and stopped and asked her if she would be the queen. Her reply ‚ÄúI‚Äôll have to ask my husband‚Äù. Elizabeth Lee Wotten became the first Daffodil Queen at the age of 28. She had only 4 days to find a proper gown. She stood on a reviewing platform with her flower girl and princess to watch the parade in downtown Tacoma. Supporters of the festival included the Chambers of Commerce of Tacoma, Puyallup, and Summner. In 1937 the Daffodil Festival was made into a non-profit corporation. Funding came from donations and the sale of memberships. An annual event, the festival encompasses the whole of Pierce County. Originally five participating cities included Tacoma, Puyallup, Sumner, Orting and Fife joined in 1959. The Daffodil Festival grew to become the 3rd largest floral festival in the US by the 1960s. The first daffodils and narcissus were planted in 1910 by George Lawler at Gardenville, now the location of the Poodle Dog Restaurant in Fife. Many of the earliest bulbs were imported from England and the Continent, sometimes at a cost of 75$ a bulb. In 1911, Lawler purchased 9000 bulbs of all varieties and kinds and hand planted them Dutch style. These plantings grew to 15 acres in North Puyallup, and finally to about 100 acres on the banks of the Nisqually River near Roy. Other early growers were Charles and Ed Orton, Frank Chernenko, H.F. Groningen and L.M.Hatch. The largest growers were Harold Knutson in Sumner, Van Lierop in Puyallup, and Wally Staazt at Orting. The best viewing times are from March 15- April 1. Despite the loss of the daffodil farmers throughout the years, Pierce County is still home to new ideas and a sense of community. The Festival now boasts a royalty program that selects young women from 23 high schools across the County and provides them with a scholarship while helping them grow in their public speaking and public service skills. Parade 2012 Daffodil Festival Royal Court The Grand Floral Parade travels through Tacoma, Puyallup, Sumner and Orting in one day. The concept of \\"four parades in four cities in one day\\" is unique to the Daffodil Festival. The parade is held every year on a Saturday in April.

He pitched for the Oakland A's, Los Angeles Dodgers, Milwaukee Brewers, Seattle Mariners (twice), Minnesota Twins, Montreal Expos, Detroit Tigers, and San Diego Padres. Early career After graduating from McMinnville High School in 1975, McMinnville, Oregon, Krueger began classes at the University of Portland on a basketball scholarship, where he was a four year starter and shared the backcourt with Darwin Cook who played 8 seasons in the National Basketball Association. Teaming with All-Americans Darwin Cook, Rick Raivio and Jose Slaughter, the Pilots averaged 18 wins a season his last 3 years there and beat two teams that ranked #1 in the country (San Francisco in 1978 and Oregon State in 1979). Bill, a three year captain, received the Thomas A. Fagan Award after his senior year. He began playing 1st base for the Pilots' baseball team in his sophomore year in 1977. A 3 year starter for the Pilots, Krueger was the team's most valuable player in 1977-78. In 1979-80, the Pilots set a school record for wins in a season. Six players were drafted off of that team including Ken Dayley, the #3 player selected in the 1980 MLB draft. Dayley had a successful big league career and was a key bullpen member of the St. Louis Cardinals World Series Championship team in 1985. In 1980, Krueger was signed by the Oakland Athletics on July 12 as an undrafted amateur free agent and assigned to the Medford A's of the short-season single-A Northwest League despite only pitching 4 innings in college. Although he went winless for Medford in seven starts that year, he struck out 48 batters, recorded a complete game, and a save. He continued to make his way through the A's minor league system for the next two years, being called up to Double-A West Haven in 1981. In 1982, Bill had a breakout season in West Haven, going 15-9 with a 2.83 earned run average with 167 strikeouts in 181 innings pitched. The West Haven club won the Eastern League Championship and Krueger made the AA All- Star Team. Professional career Krueger made his major league debut on April 10, , as the A's starter for the sixth game of the season. Facing the California Angels, Krueger pitched 7 innings and gave up 4 runs in the Oakland Coliseum. Although Angels Brian Downing singled against him to lead off the game, Krueger got veteran right fielder Juan Ben√≠quez to hit into a 4-6-3 double play. Bill went 7-6 in 16 starts for the A's in 1983, before an elbow injury ended his season. Before being traded to the Dodgers midway through the season, Bill posted a 27-31 record with a 4.69 earned run average. Bill saw action in only 3 games in two seasons for the Dodgers, and spent the majority of the 1987 and 1988 seasons with the Albuquerque Dukes, the Dodgers Triple A affiliate. Bill pitched a no-hitter for the Dukes in 1987 versus the Phoenix Firebirds and helped the Dukes win the Pacific Coast League Championship. In 1988, he had his best season as a pro, going 15-5 and leading the Pacific Coast League in wins, earned run average, and shutouts. He also had success at the plate, hitting .285 with 2 HR's and 6 RBI's in limited at bats. Bill was traded again to the Pittsburgh Pirates in late 1988. The Pirates released him during spring training of 1989, and Bill then signed with the Milwaukee Brewers 10 days later. He played in Milwaukee for only two seasons, performing well as both a starter and a reliever. He strung together 19 2/3 straight scoreless innings during the 1989 season. Krueger signed as a free agent by the Seattle Mariners after the end of the season. Krueger enjoyed what was arguably one of the best statistical years of his professional career in the Mariners rotation that year by reaching new personal bests in wins (11), strikeouts (91), and earned run average (3.60). Bill also pitched in a June 7 showdown with his former Brewers ballclub, pitching over six innings while allowing only one run and striking out 6. Bill also was named the American League Pitcher of the Month in July of 1991. Over the last 4 seasons of his career, Bill Krueger played for five different teams in the National and American leagues. Bill won 10 games for the Minnesota Twins during the season, setting career high of innings pitched (200). He also was named American League Pitcher of the Month in April of that season. Krueger was traded to Montreal, where he spent 60 days before free agency whisked him to Detroit to play for the Tigers. He again set a new season-low in earned run average (3.40) while appearing in 32 games. After being released from the Tigers mid- season in , Krueger tried to revive his career in San Diego, where he pitched for the Padres until the strike in 1994. Bill started the '95 season with the Padres but was released in May of that season and was then signed with the Mariners again in July of 1995. An interesting footnote, Krueger finished with a .400 career batting average. Bill Krueger won his last game as a major leaguer on August 6 in the same place he started his career; the Oakland Coliseum. Against the A's that day, the 37-year-old pitched over 5 innings and allowed only one run. He was kept off Seattle's '95 postseason roster. Bill retired from pro baseball in the spring of 1996 after unsuccessfully making the Chicaco Cubs roster.. Post-retirement After his retirement in 1996, Krueger went into broadcasting. He covered both college basketball and professional baseball and is presently the senior baseball analyst for Root Sports Northwest, covering the Seattle Mariners. He was joined at the network in 2007 by former M's teammate Mike Blowers. For the past 7 years, Bill has been the Director of Individual Philanthropy for NW Center (www.nwcenter.org). After 13 years as a financial advisor, Bill returned to wealth management running business development for Coldstream (www.coldstream.com) in 2016. With his wife Jo, Krueger is a past co-president of the Cure Autism Now Northwest chapter, now merged with Autism Speaks. They were successful in making the NW Chapter the country's first chapter to raise $1 million. They have publicly told the story of raising a daughter (Chanel) with autism. Chanel recently graduated from Seattle U School of Law (2019). In 2012 at age 54, he experienced sudden cardiac arrest on August 10 at the Redmond Pro Sports Club, where four employees worked together to assist in saving his life. Krueger has since thanked them publicly for their efforts. . Bill actively speaks out about the importance of heart health.

The Galien River passes through Warren Woods State Park which supports the last climax beech-maple forest in the state of Michigan. The Galien River watershed supports the state's largest breeding population of yellow-throated warblers (Setophaga dominica), and a substantial population of breeding cerulean warblers (Setophaga cerulea). Also supports a high diversity of bottomland forest obligate bird species. Designated coldwater streams in the watershed include: the main stem of the Galien River, east branch Galien River, Blue Jay Creek, south branch Galien River, and a portion of Spring Creek. Watershed The watershed encompasses approximately in portions of La Porte County, Indiana, and Berrien County, Michigan. The main branch of the Galien rises from the outflow of Dayton Lake in the northwest corner of Bertrand Township and flows west to the village of Galien, Michigan. It then flows northwest into Weesaw Township and north to near New Troy, where it is joined by the East Branch and begins to flow west and then southwest to New Buffalo. Agriculture is the dominant land use in the watershed and the majority of the water bodies have been dredged or channelized to facilitate the rapid conveyance of water from the relatively flat landscape.

Myanmar is one of very few countries where tea is eaten as well as drunk. Its pickled tea is unique in the region, and is not only regarded as the national delicacy but plays a significant role in Burmese society. Its place in the cuisine of Myanmar is reflected by the following popular expression: \\"Of all the fruit, the mango's the best; of all the meat, the pork's the best; and of all the leaves, lahpet's the best\\". In the West, laphet is most commonly encountered in tea leaf salad (). Forms *Lahpet chauk () or dried tea leaves, also called a-gyan gyauk ( crude dry), are used to make green tea - yei-nway gyan (, plain/crude hot water) or lahpet-yei gyan (, plain/crude tea); it is the national drink in a predominantly Buddhist country with no national drink other than the palm toddy. *Acho gyauk (, lit. sweet and dry) or black tea makes sweet tea (, lahpetyei gyo) with milk and sugar. *Lahpet so () means wet tea to distinguish it from dried tea and indicates pickled tea although lahpet is generally synonymous with pickled tea.

Zayan leaves, which make up about 80% of the harvest, are best picked in April and May before the onset of the monsoons, but they can be picked until October. Another old adage goes thus: \\"For good lahpet, let the Palaung take their time up the hills\\" (·Äú·ÄÄ·Ä∫·Äñ·ÄÄ·Ä∫·ÄÄ·Ä±·Ä¨·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Ä∏ ·ÄÖ·Ä¨·Ä∏·ÄÅ·Äª·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Äõ·ÄÑ·Ä∫ ·Äï·Äú·Ä±·Ä¨·ÄÑ·Ä∫ ·Äê·Ä±·Ä¨·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Äê·ÄÄ·Ä∫ ·Äî·Äæ·Ä±·Ä∏·Äõ·Äô·Ää·Ä∫). Over of land are under tea with an annual yield of 60,000-70,000 tonnes. Of this 69.5% is green tea, 19.5% black tea and 20% pickled tea. Annual consumption runs at 52% green tea, 31% black tea and 17% pickled tea.  History  Lahpet was a pre-colonial symbolic peace offering between warring kingdoms in the history of Myanmar, and is exchanged and consumed after settling a dispute. In both pre-colonial and colonial times, lahpet was served after the civil court judge made a verdict; if the arbitrators ate the lahpet, this signified formal acceptance of the verdict. Laphet remains a traditional Burmese gesture of hospitality, served to guests when visiting homes. Processing The traditional laphet fermentation process is a three-step process, including pre-fermentation, fermentation, and modification of the fermented tea leaves. Tender juvenile tea leaves and leaf buds are selected for fermenting and the rest for drying. After picking, the tea leaves are steamed for about five minutes before either drying or fermenting. Young leaves are then packed into bamboo vats or clay pots, set in pits and pressed by heavy weights to extract water; the fermentation process is checked at intervals and the pulp may occasionally require re-steaming. The anaerobic fermentation is driven by naturally forming lactic acid bacteria, and completed in 3‚Äì4 months, indicated by the pulp's changes in color (from green to golden-green), texture (softened leaves), and reduced acidity. The near- final pulp is then washed, massaged, an drained. The final form of laphet is then flavored with a mixture of minced garlic and ground chili, salt, fresh lemon juice, and peanut oil. Preparation styles Pickled tea in the center compartment is served in a lahpet ohk with accompanying condiments Burmese tea leaf salad () is served as two main forms. First is mainly used to serve in ceremonies and is called A-hlu lahpet () or Mandalay lahpet. The second one is mostly served with meals and is more popular. A-hlu lahpet () or Mandalay lahpet is served traditionally in a shallow lacquerware dish called lahpet ohk with a lid and divided into small compartments. Pickled tea is laced with sesame oil in a central compartment surrounded, in their own compartments, by other ingredients namely crisp fried garlic, chickpeas, butterfly peas, Australian peas, and toasted sesame and peanuts, crushed dried shrimp, preserved shredded ginger and fried shredded coconut. A rare treat in Mandalay may be a delicacy, dried and lightly pan-fried, called twin poh -- a species of aquatic grub that is found only in a lake in the crater of an extinct volcano called Twindaung near Monywa. No special occasion or ceremony in Myanmar is considered complete without lahpet. A-hlu means alms and is synonymous with a novitiation ceremony called shinbyu. Lahpet is served in this form at hsun jway (offering a meal to monks) and weddings. Nat (spirit) worship features lahpet offered to the guardian spirits of forests, mountains, rivers and fields. Invitation to a shinbyu is traditionally by calling from door to door with a lahpet ohk, and acceptance is indicated by its partaking. It may be served as a snack or after a meal holding centre stage on table with green tea; it may be just for the family and visitors. Apart from its bittersweet and pungent taste and leafy texture, many believe in its medicinal properties as beneficial for the digestive system and controlling bile and mucus. Its stimulant effect to ward off tiredness and sleepiness is especially popular with students preparing for exams, pw√® goers at all-night theatrical performances, and helpers at funerals who keep watch overnight. Lahpet thohk () or Yangon lahpet is pickled tea salad which is very popular all over Myanmar, especially with women. Some teashops would have it on their menu as well as Burmese restaurants. It is prepared by mixing all the above ingredients without the coconut but in addition includes fresh tomatoes, garlic and green chilli, sometimes shredded cabbage, and is dressed with fish sauce, sesame or peanut oil, and a squeeze of lime. Many would have lahpet together with plain white rice, again a student favourite. This form is traditionally served at the end of every meal. Some of the most popular brands sold in packets include Ayee Taung lahpet from Mandalay, Shwe Toak from Mogok, Yuzana and Pinpyo Ywetnu from Yangon. Mixed ingredients of fried garlic, peas, peanuts and sesame have become available as Hna-pyan jaw (literally twice fried) for convenience although traditionally they have been sold separately. Ayee Taung has been around for over 100 years and its new recipes such as Shu- sh√® (extra hot) and Kyetcheini (Red Cross) are quite popular. Zayan lahpet is mixed with carambola (star fruit), and pickled young leaves may be cut together with coarse leaves. Many prefer Mogok lahpet as it uses only young tea leaves. In the Northern Thai provinces of Chiang Mai, Chiang Rai and Mae Hong Son, lahpet thohk can be found at restaurants where Shan ethnic food is served. In Thai, it is called yam miang (‡∏¢‡∏≥‡πÄ‡∏´‡∏°‡∏µ‡∏¢‡∏á), from Shan neng yam (). Health scandal On 12 March 2009, the Ministry of Health announced that 43 brands of lahpet including the popular brands contained a dye, auramine O, that is not permitted for food use. This was believed to arise from wholesale dealers using cheaper chemical dyes instead of the traditional food dyes. Singapore ordered a ban on 20 brands of lahpet from Burma, including eight varieties marketed by Yuzana, which were not declared unsafe by the Burmese authorities. Businesses were hit by a dramatic drop in sales of this popular food considered indispensable at social gatherings and on special occasions. Malaysia joined the ban but not Thailand, which has a sizeable Burmese population. Amazing Green Tea, Eating green tea - Is It Healthy?

The band has been known as emotional dark metal. The band's sound is built on the combination of synths and guitars, laced with clean vocals and additional growling and screaming vocals. The lyrical concept of Throes of Dawn is often poetic, reflecting the deeper and darker aspects of the human psyche; solitude, feelings of loss, and the fears and pains of existence. History The band's sound mixes synthesizer and guitars with a blend of clean vocals along with additional growling and screaming vocals. The band's lyrics are often known as poetic, expressing the darker aspects of solitude, feelings of loss and the fears and pains of life. Their debut album Pakkasherra was released in 1997, and the band has since released six albums. On April 30, 2010 the band played their album The Great Fleet of Echoes from start to finish for a special live performance at the Graveyard Party 2010 in Gloria, Helsinki.graveyardparty.com =Full line-up, demos and first album release (1995‚Äì97)= After getting their full line-up together, the band started making their first demo tape. After the demo tape was released the band signed with Woodcut Records in 1995,woodcutrecords.com/artists_prev.html making it the first deal of the band's history. This led to the release of their promo tape Pakkasherra in 1996, which preceded the album Pakkasherra in 1997. Later that year the band supported the Norwegian black Metal band Satyricon in Helsinki. =Dreams of the Black Earth record release (1997‚Äì99)= The band's second full-length album Dreams of the Black Earth was recorded in the legendary Tico-Tico studio in late 1997. This album showcased a unique sound as well as a maturation and progression from Pakkasherra. Only one song from the album, \\"Dreams of the Black Earth\\", was issued as a promotional track in 1998 on The Blackened Rainbow MCD. In 1999 Dreams of the Black Earth was released worldwide. =New record label with release of third album (1999‚Äì2000)= The recording of the band's third album Binding of the Spirit took place at Tico-Tico studios in Autumn 1999. The album had a better sound quality than their previous albums as well as more refined production than they had previously added to the dark metal genre. The album was released through the avant-garde music sub-label Wounded Loveavantgardemusic.com/HTML/content/artist/detail.php?id=band_15 in Spring 2000. It received positive reviews from the press and listeners worldwide. =Hiatus (2000‚Äì03)= After the release of Binding of the Spirit, the founders of the band, Henri Koivula and Jani Heinola, moved from their hometown Vaasa to Turku and Helsinki. During this time the band did not perform together for several months, and Jani and Henri considered splitting up the band altogether. However, they later decided to regroup with the band with a new line-up, with all members but Henri residing in Helsinki. The new members came from bands that were already familiar to Jani and Henri from their time in Vaasa: the lead guitarist Juha Ylikoski had played with the band Rotten Sound, the bassist Harri Huhtala had played in Cartilagemetal- archives.com/band.php?id=3299 and Vomiturition. Their drummer Jani Martikkala had been with ‚Ä¶And Oceans, Black Dawn and Enochian Crescent.www.metalstorm.net/bands/band.php?band_id=2315 =Quicksilver Clouds (2004‚Äì05)= After several years of songwriting, Throes of Dawn started recording their fourth album Quicksilver Clouds in 2003 at Sonic-pump studios in Helsinki. The band added to their traditional sound, which helped introduce new elements to the genre of dark metal. After a year in the studio Quicksliver Clouds was finally released in 2004 by Avantgarde Music,avantgardemusic.com/HTML/content/album/detail.php?id=album_114 with positive feedback from metal music outlets. During the promotion of the new album, Throes of Dawn performed numerous successful live shows with bands like Anathema, Orphaned Land and Green Carnation. Besides performing in Finland they also went to Germany, the Netherlands and Russia. =New album, new member, and new management (2006‚Äì10)= It took altogether almost six years for Throes of Dawn to release their fifth album The Great Fleet of Echoes. After the release of Quicksilver Clouds the band started to experiment with new elements and sounds for their music. They composed new material and recorded new demos, but they did not receive a deadline from their record label. The band eventually decided to record the album themselves, with the help of familiar sound technicians. The official recording of the album did not start until around November 2007. After various locations and sessions, the recordings and mixing ended in November 2009. In early 2010 Throes of Dawn announced new member, keyboardist Henri Andersson. The band released a statement to metalunderground.com, which read: \\"We are very happy to announce a new addition to our line up. In Hard Rock Laager festival keyboardist Henri Andersson became our sixth permanent member. Mr. Andersson has been playing with us live since the beginning of 2010 and fits our gang perfectly. Welcome to the band Henri!\\" The mastering of The Great Fleet of Echoes was done in Finnvox studios. The band introduced melancholic and atmospheric changes into their music. The Great Fleet of Echoes also expanded the band's foray into songwriting, including adding progressive elements. The Great Fleet of Echoes was released worldwide through their new current label Firebox Records in February 2010. =Theft of equipment and change of drummers (2011‚Äì13)= By January 3, 2011, Throes of Dawn had received acclaim for The Great Fleet of Echoes, including from Finnish Inferno magazine, which chose The Throes of Dawn as the second-best Finnish album of 2010. The Spanish magazine Friedhof ranked the album in their list of 2010's top 10 best albums. A few days after the great feedback for the album between January 10‚Äì12, 2011, the band's training facility was broken into and almost all of their equipment was stolen. Many valuable items were taken, including the Marshall JCM800 that was used on the first three Throes of Dawn albums.http://www.throesofdawn.com/ The break-in had a significant impact on the band, who said that much of the equipment taken was irreplaceable and featured unique designs. The value of the goods that were stolen exceeded $10,000. The Police Department Property crime unit of Helsinki investigated, and they received numerous tips. One tip- off led to a significant amount of the equipment being found several weeks later on January 27, 2011. Not many details could be revealed, for the thieves that stole the goods were still missing. On February 9, 2011 the band received a nomination for best Gothic metal album of the year for their album The Great Fleet of Echoes. Throes of Dawn officially announced the departure of long time drummer Jani \\"Martex\\" Martikkala on November 9, 2012. As said on their official page, \\"Throes of Dawn has parted ways with the drum player, Jani Martikkala. Jani has been a member in the band for 10 years, and needless to say, we share lots of good memories together. However, life and priorities change and we decided to part ways with mutual agreement.\\" Soon their after, they made an announcement of new drummer Juuso Backman, formerly of Swath, Thales, and All Dreams Dying. Throes of Dawn also made the statement \\"Juuso shares the taste and vision of how our music should sound like, so he will be a perfect addition to the Throes of Dawn roster.\\" At that time, their next album was expected to be released from early to mid-2013. =Sixth studio album (2014‚Äìpresent)= The band posted a statement on their official on April 24, 2014, speaking after a nearly three-year silence to announce the impending arrival of a new album. The statement read, in part: \\"OK folks, Time to breach the long silence and see what's happening in the TOD land: We are soon entering studio to record the drums and some miscellaneous instruments for the upcoming sixth album. The recordings will take place early May in D-STUDIO at Klaukkala, Finland. We have carefully selected and refined seven songs which might potentially appear on the upcoming album. We have put quite a lot of effort on these songs; a lot of hours spent at the rehearsal place playing and drinking beer and thinking about the compositions and structures.\\"https://www.facebook.com/throesofdawn/posts/10154088403455385?fref=nf&pnref;=story On March 30, 2015, they announced that Henri, their vocalist had finalized the vocal tracks for the remaining songs on the album in D-studio, Klaukkala, Finland. The album, Our Voices Shall Remain, was eventually released on August 20, 2016.

It has four runways and is used entirely by the United States Army Aviation Branch. UFOs: Mantell Incident The Thomas Mantell incident began at 1:20pm on 7 January 1948, when the control tower operators at Godman Army Airfield, Kentucky sighted an unidentified airborne object in the sky close to the base. Several senior officers were summoned, and the base Operations and Intelligence Officer were soon joined by the Commanding Officer, but none were able to identify the object. At the time a flight of four P-51 fighters was on a routine training flight under the supervision of Flight Commander Captain Thomas Mantell. They were flying towards Godman Field when, at approximately 2:45pm, the control tower officer in charge ordered them to investigate the strange object. Captain Mantell acknowledged, but a short time later one of the pilots requested permission to break away as he was running low on fuel, leaving the three remaining aircraft to head in the direction of the strange object. The next message came from one of the three remaining pilots, who said he was losing his bearings and was becoming fearful of becoming lost. He too was granted permission to break away and return, but he would be accompanied by one of the two remaining pilots, who was instructed to accompany his colleague to guide him safely back to base. The only aircraft now in pursuit of the object was that piloted by Captain Thomas Mantell. At 15,000 feet Mantell contacted the control tower and stated that he had the object in sight and was climbing to investigate. A short time later Mantell reported that he was closing on the object but that was the last message broadcast. Mantell's aircraft crashed approximately 90 miles south of Godman Field. The official Air Technical Information Command report on the crash stated that they were of the opinion that Captain Mantell lost consciousness due to oxygen starvation. The trimmed aircraft had continued to climb until increasing altitude caused a sufficient loss of power for it to level out. The aircraft then began to turn left due to torque and as the wing drooped, so did the nose, until it was in a tight turning spiral. The uncontrolled descent resulted in excessive speed causing the aircraft to disintegrate. It is believed that Captain Mantell never regained consciousness. This was borne out by the fact that the canopy lock was still in place after the crash, discounting any attempt to abandon the aircraft. They also stated that the UFO was in no way responsible for the crash.

It had a population of 4,327 in 2001,Office for National Statistics : Census 2001 : Parish Headcounts : Rotherham Retrieved 28 August 2009 reducing to 4,058 at the 2011 Census. History Thrybergh ‚Äì which is mentioned in the Domesday Book ‚Äì was given to William de Perci, a chief aide to William the Conqueror and founder of the well-known Percy family, after the Norman conquest of England in 1066. The estate was passed on to the Normainvilles around the year 1200, and it remained with them until 1316, when Sir Adam Reresby became Lord of Thrybergh.Reresby of Thrybergh, Rotherhamweb.co.uk For the next 400 or so years, an unbroken succession of sixteen generations of Reresbys held their place in Thrybergh.The Reresbys intermarried with other Yorkshire gentry families. Among the stained glass at the Old Hall in High Melton was a panel showing the arms of Reresby impaling those of the Levett family. Although recorded in the Sheffield archives, the panel was apparently lost when the Old Hall was subsequently renovated. Facilities Thrybergh has many schools, including Thrybergh Academy, Thrybergh Primary, Dalton Foljambe Primary, St Gerards Catholic Primary, and Thrybergh Fullerton Primary. St Leonard's church There are three churches in Thrybergh, St Gerard's Catholic, St Leonard's Church of England, and St Peter's Church of England. St Leonard's has a nave built in the eleventh and twelfth centuries, with later windows, a fourteenth- century chancel, and a fifteenth-century tower on the west end, topped by a spire. The building was extensively renovated in 1871 and 1894, and a vestry block was added prior to 1970. Internally, it contains a number of tombs and wall monuments, including the tomb of Ralph Reresby, who died in 1530, and a noteworthy monument to Lionel Reresby and his wife Anne, who died in 1587. The building is grade II* listed. Thrybergh Park country house To the north west of the village is Thrybergh Park, in which is situated a grade II listed country house, built around 1820 by John Webb. The house is built of ashlar sandstone, with a roof of Welsh slate. The main section has two storeys and is of square appearance, with five bays on all sides, build in Tudor revival style with some Gothic Revival detailing. There is a low three-storey tower, and the house was commissioned by Colonel Fullerton. The building is now used as the club house for Rotherham Golf Club, which was formed in 1903. The park is home to Rotherham Golf Course, which, in the past used to hold famous tournaments. Par for the course is 70. Simon Coumbe of Pontefract Golf Club holds the course record with a score of 62, which he achieved in September 2005 during the second round of the inaugural Lee Westwood Trophy. He broke the previous record of 65, which was held jointly by Lee Westwood and Ian Garbutt. Thrybergh has one public house, The Lord Reresby. As well as this, other places include the Thrybergh Sports Centre now closed The Fosters Garden Centre and Fosters Petrol Station Now closed Thrybergh Country Park is situated just outside the village. Notable people Many people in public life and the world of entertainment have come from Thrybergh, or live there. These include: *Admiral Sir John Fullerton (1840‚Äì1918), Royal Navy officer and courtier *Paul Shane (Actor and Comedian) lived in Thrybergh up his death in May 2013 *Alan Simpson (Olympian) who attended St Gerard's Catholic Primary School *Ian Snodin former football player *Glynn Snodin former football player *Jackie Stamps former footballer. Scored two goals for Derby County in the 1946 FA Cup Final. Thrybergh tip During the Second World War, Sheffield Corporation realised that the tip they were using at Kilnhurst for the dumping of sewage sludge was nearly full, and so bought land on which to establish a new tip beside the railway line that ran to Silverwood Colliery. Tenders for the supply of railway tracks were let in March 1946, while concrete boundary posts and fencing were erected by Tarmac Limited. The first trains of waste from Blackburn Meadows sewage treatment works to the Thrybergh tip began arriving in January 1948. The railway installation consisted of two sidings, forming a passing loop, with temporary trackwork laid beyond that to reach the tipping point. Trains of wooden wagons were delivered to one siding, and each was then lowered to the end of the tipping track on a cable, emptied, and then hauled back to the other siding by a David Brown tractor. The wooden wagons were replaced by steel ones in 1958, and a dragline mechanical excavator was supplied by Thomas Smith & Sons of Rodley two years later. The tractor was replaced by a diesel hydraulic locomotive in 1962. This had been built as an 0‚Äì4‚Äì0 saddle tank steam engine in 1918 by Peckett and Sons of Bristol, but was converted when the Blackburn Meadows works acquired two diesel electric shunters. The work was undertaken by staff at Blackburn Meadows, who removed the water tank and boiler, and fitted a Perkins 4-cylinder engine extracted from a crane which was by then redundant. The result was of unusual appearance, but proved to be efficient and trouble-free. It was returned to Blackburn Meadows in 1967, and was cut up for scrap soon afterwards. Two train movements a day occurred five days a week, with a train of full wagons arriving, and a train of empties departing. Each train consisted of between 32 and 34 wagons, and no trains were normally run on Sundays or Mondays. The tipping of sewage sludge ceased in 1969, when Blackburn Meadows was upgraded to include an incinerator, but the use of the tip did not cease, as it was used from March 1969 for dumping burnt ash from the incinerator. This task, which included maintaining the tip, was put out to contract, and was initially won by XRE Transport Ltd.

It was initially developed, owned, and operated by Premier Parks. It is currently owned by EPR Properties and operated by Six Flags. History Waterworld California, originally Waterworld USA, opened in 1995. It was developed by what was then Premier Parks, which also leased and operated the original WaterWorld USA (now Raging Waters Sacramento). Premier Parks also owned nearby Marine World Africa USA (now Six Flags Discovery Kingdom). The three parks were operated by the same management, and their close proximity made for deals so that season passes to Marine World also worked at the Waterworld USA parks. Premier Parks acquired Six Flags on April 1, 1998, and eventually changed its name to Six Flags Inc. In 1998 Six Flags began rebranding numerous properties, however, the Waterworld parks were not renamed until 2003, when they became Six Flags Waterworld. At the end of the 2006 season, Six Flags divested itself of multiple properties including the two Waterworld parks. The Concord park was purchased by CNL Lifestyle Properties on January 11, 2007. Multiple CNL properties, including Waterworld, were operated by Premier Parks LLC ‚Äî although similar in name, it was not the same company that built the park. In November 2016, CNL sold its recreational assets, including Waterworld, to EPR Properties. Premier Parks LLC continued to manage Waterworld. On April 27, 2017, Six Flags Entertainment Corporation announced it would take over the park's operations from Premier Parks, LLC. On February 22, 2018, Six Flags announced the name of the park would change to Six Flags Hurricane Harbor Concord.https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180222005405/en/Concord- Water-Park-Flags-Hurricane-Harbor-Concord Due to the growing concerns of the COVID-19 pandemic, Six Flags announced a suspension of operations across the company on March 13, 2020. In early August, the water park announced on their social media that the 2020 operating season had been canceled and that Six Flags Hurricane Harbor Concord looks forward to open again in 2021. This would be the first season for the water park to not operate since its inception in 1995. Incidents On June 2, 1997, the Banzai Pipeline collapsed after students piled into the water slide in an attempt to break a school record. A section of the slide gave way under the weight of the students, all of whom had congregated in the section in particular, resulting in the group falling several metres to the ground. The collapse of the water slide resulted in 32 injures and the death of an 18-year-old female. It was stated that the slide experienced weight forces three times greater than what it was designed for. This incident was featured on an episode of Dateline.

Maxwell has been praised for his objective view on the 1962 Sino-Indian War, but criticised for his pessimistic and often inaccurate views on Indian democracy. Career An Australian born in London, Maxwell was educated at McGill University in Canada and the University of Cambridge in England. He joined The Times as a foreign correspondent in 1955 and spent three years in the Washington bureau. In 1959 he was posted to New Delhi as the South Asia correspondent. In the next eight years, he traveled from Kabul to East Pakistan and Kathmandu to Ceylon, reporting on the end of the Nehru era in India and the post-Nehru developments.Neville Maxwell, India's China War, Scribd.com During the 1962 Sino-Indian War, Maxwell wrote for The Times from New Delhi and was the only reporter there who did not uncritically accept the official Indian account of events. This eventually led to his \\"virtual expulsion\\" from India. In 1967, Maxwell joined the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, as a senior fellow to write his book India's China War. He was with the Institute of Commonwealth Studies at Oxford University when the book was published in 1970. Regarded as a comprehensive revisionist study, India's China War contradicted the then prevalent understanding of the war as a product of Chinese \\"betrayal and expansionism\\", and set out to prove that it was \\"in fact of India‚Äôs making, that it was 'India's China War'\\". The book drew extensively from India's classified Henderson Brooks‚ÄìBhagat Report, an internal operational review of India's military debacle, which Maxwell was able to obtain a copy of. Due to the lack of available information from China, Maxwell had to rely on inferences based on official Chinese statements with regards to China's perceptions. He did not attempt to evaluate the accuracy of these perceptions. India's China War was widely praised across a diverse range of opinions, including British historian A. J. P. Taylor, Chinese premier Zhou Enlai and US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. On the other hand, Singaporean leader Lee Kuan Yew considered it \\"revisionist, pro-China history\\". In India, the Indian government charged him with breach of the Official Secrets Act, forcing him to stay out of India to avoid arrest until the charges were annulled by Prime Minister Morarji Desai eight years later. The book may have been instrumental in bridging the gulf between the US and China. According to Maxwell, Kissinger told Zhou Enlai, \\"Reading that book showed me I could do business with you people.\\" US President Richard Nixon too is said to have read the book and discussed it with Zhou Enlai during his 1972 visit to China. Maxwell's contention that the war was \\"a frame-up\\" was \\"a flash of light everywhere.\\" Zhou is said to have acknowledged to Maxwell, \\"your book did a service to truth which benefitted China.\\" =View on Indian democracy= In the 1960s, Maxwell incorrectly predicted that India would not remain a democracy for much longer. While serving as the South Asia correspondent of The Times of London, Maxwell authored a series of pessimistic reports filed in February 1967. In the atmosphere leading up to the 4th Lok Sabha elections, he wrote that \\"The great experiment of developing India within a democratic framework has failed. [Indians will soon vote] in the fourth‚Äîand surely last‚Äîgeneral election.\\" =Leak of the Henderson Brooks‚ÄìBhagat report= On 17 March 2014, Maxwell posted the first part of the Henderson Brooks‚ÄìBhagat Report on his website. The report was written by two Indian army officers in 1963 to examine India's defeat in the Sino-Indian War. It has been classified as top secret by the Indian government, but Maxwell acquired a copy and his India's China War contains the gist of the report. After the Indian government refused to release the report for over 50 years, Maxwell decided to make it public. Reception Scholars regard Maxwell's India's China War as a revisionist account of the Sino-Indian War. The earliest accounts of the war regarded China as the aggressor that unleashed its forces on an unsuspecting India. Maxwell inverted the blame, by asserting that India was the aggressor and China the victim. : \\"The earliest accounts by academic authors looked upon India as the victim of Chinese betrayal and expansionism, and a pro-Indian school of thought was thereby established. Contrary ideas about the historical-legal side of the dispute were soon introduced by the British historian Alastair Lamb. But a more favourable image of China vis-a-vis India did not appear until 1970, when Neville Maxwell's comprehensive revisionist study was published.\\" : \\"To anyone at the time of the Sino-Indian dispute who tried to think about the case on its merits it was manifest that the faults were, at least, not all on China's side. But very few in the West made this effort.... [Maxwell's] book is designed to rectify this.\\" : \\"Dorothy Woodman in Himalayan Frontiers in 1969, like Fisher, put the full blame for the war on China. ... On the contrary, Neville Maxwell in his India‚Äôs China War focused on the faults of the Government of India, maintaining that it was mostly the latter‚Äôs provocative border policy that was responsible for a major escalation.\\" The book received negative reviews in India. Historian Parshotam Mehra commented that \\"deeply-rooted prejudice\\" oozed out of its every sentence, with examples such as: To sustain his narrative, Maxwell cited those facts alone that were convenient and omitted the others. Well-known scholarly analyses such as the Himalayan Battleground or Francis Watson's The Frontiers of China were missing from Maxwell's bibliography, and so too were the writings of men who had first-hand knowledge, such as Sir Olaf Caroe. Notwithstanding these defects, Mehra believed that the book made a contribution as an \\"alternative point of view to an understanding of the events\\" that led to the hostilities. Historian Sarvepalli Gopal, himself a key player in the Sino-Indian dispute as the Head of Indian MEA's historical division, wrote a lengthy rebuttal in The Round Table. He pointed out that the Indian case for its border definition was set out in considerable detail in the Report of the Officials, which Maxwell dismisses with a one-liner and no real analysis.: 'Mr. Maxwell, however, brushes aside the whole complex Indian argument with half a sentence. \\"The Indian officials' report, which to a quick or unquestioning reader does seem a massive documentation of the Indian case...\\" (p. 218). How, one might ask, does it appear to a slow and questioning reader, such as, one presumes, Mr. Maxwell believes himself to be; but he does not bother to tell us.' Historian Srinath Raghavan, Senior Fellow at the Centre for Policy Research, called India's China War a \\"seminal revisionist account\\". He argued that Maxwell \\"overreached\\" and that he \\"curiously interpreted Delhi's actions almost as Beijing would have viewed it\\". Raghavan recommended \\"post-revisionist\\" accounts, such as Steven Hoffman's India and the China Crisis. American political scientist John Garver wrote that Maxwell shaped the orthodox scholarly view, which was also reached by American scholar Allen Whiting, regarding China's perception of and response to India's Forward Policy: \\"in deciding for war, China's leaders were responding to an Indian policy of establishing Indian military outposts in territory claimed by both India and China but already under effective Chinese military occupation.\\" Garver pointed out that Maxwell did not have access to Chinese documents or archives which would have given him insights into their policy making process.

Canada. International Fuel Tax Agreement. Retrieved on 26-08-2015. Alaska, Hawaii, and the Canadian territories are not required to participate, however all of Canada and Alaska do. An operating carrier with IFTA receives an IFTA license and two decals for each qualifying vehicle it operates. The carrier files a quarterly fuel tax report. This report is used to determine the net tax or refund due and to redistribute taxes from collecting states to states that it is due. This tax is required for motor vehicles used, designed, or maintained for transportation of persons or property and: *The Power Unit has two axles and a gross vehicle weight or registered gross vehicle weight in excess of 26,000 pounds, and/or *The Power Unit has three or more axles regardless of weight, and/or *Is used in combination, when the weight of such combination exceeds 26,000 pounds gross vehicle or registered gross vehicle weight.http://www.iftach.org/manuals/2010/AA/Articles%20of%20Agreement%20FINAL%20-%20January%202010.pdf Exceptions exist for recreational vehicles such as motor homes, pickup trucks with attached campers, and buses when used exclusively for personal pleasure by an individual. Some states have their own exemptionshttp://www.iftach.org/exempt/view/general.php that often apply to farm vehicles or government vehicles.  Promulgation  Prior to IFTA each state had its own fuel tax system and a truck needed tax permits for each state in which it operated. Most states established Ports of Entry to issue permits and enforce tax collection, which was burdensome to the trucking industry and the states. Pre-IFTA trucks in interstate commerce carried special plates (\\"Bingo Plates\\") upon which each state's permit sticker was affixed. This was inefficient and proved to be costly for each state to manage.  How it works  Simply stated, IFTA works as a \\"pay now or pay later\\" system. As commercial motor vehicles buy fuel, any fuel taxes paid are credited to that licensee's account. At the end of the fiscal quarter, the licensee completes their fuel tax report, listing all miles traveled in all participating jurisdictions and lists all gallons purchased. Then the average fuel mileage is applied to the miles traveled to determine the tax liability to each jurisdiction. Three states‚ÄîKentucky, New Mexico, and New York‚Äîhave \\"weight-mile\\" taxes in addition to the standard fuel tax. Oregon has just a weight-mile tax. Any amount of fuel taxes due (or refund) is then paid to (or received from) the base jurisdiction who issued the license. The member jurisdictions then take care of transferring the funds accordingly. Audits are conducted only by the base state and fuel bonds are rarely required.

The wayside provides a sheltered platform from which to view the ocean. First established as a wayside parking area on the Oregon Coast Highway in 1930, the wayside building was built in 1956 as a restroom facility for the popular spot. It is located just to the north of the Depoe Bay Bridge, also on the National Register. Description The 1¬Ω-story concrete building stands directly on the rocky coast at a slightly lower level than the highway, directly adjacent to the entrance to Depoe Bay. The main level consists of a single room used as a display and concession area, with a stairway to the lower level, where the toilets are located. The main room has large windows facing the ocean. A stair in the center of the space leads up to an octagonal observation room in the middle of the roof terrace, with five windows facing the ocean. The roof supports an open-air observation deck. The structure is surrounded by a concrete plaza that also overlooks the ocean, with a low stone-capped concrete wall surrounding the area. A promenade runs northwards from the wayside along the shoreline, shielded by a stone wall that served as the prototype for the decorative stonework at the wayside's plaza. The observatory building's appearance is essentially the same as its 1950s appearance. History The Depoe Bay Ocean Wayside was built after residents of Depoe Bay implored the Oregon State Highway Department for a restroom facility at the popular location. Conceptual designs were developed by landscape architect Harold Spooner, with four designs: an entirely unobtrusive structure below road level, a low flat-roofed building, a flat-roofed building with a prominent lighthouse-like tower, and a flat-roofed structure (labeled \\"Cliff House\\") with an octagonal cupola. The last alternate was chosen, with alterations to incorporate interior stairways and an overall lowering of grade to avoid blocking the view from the highway. Spooner's concept was developed by Oregon Highway Department Carl Schneider. The wayside was completed in June 1956. The main level has been occupied by a series of concessionaires, a condition imposed by the state, concerned that the property be self- supporting. It has been described as a smaller version of Vista House at Crown Point on the Columbia River, and serves a similar purpose. The Depoe Bay wayside was operated by the Oregon Department of Transportation until 1988, when it was transferred to Depoe Bay. In 2008 it was again transferred to the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department. It has been used as a lookout for watching gray whales since 2005. Whale watching Approximately 20,000 whales migrate southward past the center from mid-December to end of January each year. The same number migrate northward, but are distributed throughout mid-March through the first week of June. Gray whales are the most commonly sighted whales year round along the Oregon Coast. Prime viewing is during the migration seasons of December through January, and March through June. July will bring summer feeding whales with peak viewing August through October. Summer is when the whales are the closest to shore making them easier to watch. Other types of whales observed are humpbacks, minkes, orca, and sometimes sperm and blue whale. There are approximately 2500 unique whale individuals observed from the center each year. The center is free to enter, has binoculars for public use, and is out of the weather. Winter migration brings the highest concentration of whales, with 20,000 passing Oregon from the last week of December through the first week of February, but winter also brings stormy conditions. Good viewing conditions make it possible to see up to thirty whales an hour but winter weather can make observation difficult, and the rough seas usually cause the whales to travel farther from shore. Spring migration brings the whales closer to shore, from a to out, and it also brings better viewing weather. The whales are less concentrated as juveniles, adults and mother/baby pairs travel at different times. The last week of March is usually the beginning of the migration past Oregon and continues through the first week of June. Mothers and calves are the slowest moving and usually observed passing Oregon during the month of May. Whales sometimes spend the summer here instead of traveling to the Alaskan feed grounds. They feed on the clouds of crustaceans (Mysidacea) which hover around the kelp beds. Summer whales feed very close to shore with the best viewing during August through October.

Named for the town of Oceanside, California, she was the only U.S. Naval vessel to bear the name. Originally laid down as LCT (7)‚Äì1675 on 11 July 1944 at the Charleston Navy Yard, she was launched on 3 August 1944, sponsored by Miss Emily V. Jackson; and commissioned on 25 September 1944 as USS LSM-175. Service history =World War II, 1944-1946= Following a Chesapeake Bay shakedown, LSM‚Äì175 departed the east coast, transited the Panama Canal, and continued on to San Diego, arriving 1 December. From San Diego, she proceeded to San Francisco, then to Pearl Harbor and the Solomon Islands. Arriving at Florida Island on 20 February, she trained for her first campaign, Okinawa. She departed the Solomons on 12 March, staged at Ulithi, then steamed west, arriving off the Hagushi beaches on western Okinawa on 1 April. As the assault forces streamed ashore, LSM‚Äì175 unloaded transport and cargo vessels. At 0910 an enemy aircraft was taken under fire. In the course of the fight anti-aircraft projectiles struck in the LSM's well deck, wounding nine embarked marines and two \\"bluejackets\\". On the 6th, she again turned her guns on an enemy aircraft and assisted in splashing it 600 yards off the starboard bow. On 20 April she got underway for Ulithi, whence she steamed to Leyte, arriving on 28 May. For the remainder of the war LSM‚Äì175 carried rolling stock and mixed cargo to the Marianas and amongst the Philippines, returning to Okinawa in mid-August. Through September she operated in the Philippines and in October shifted to Japan for brief duty with the occupation forces. Arriving in Tokyo Bay on 8 October she sailed for the United States in late November. On 26 December she arrived at San Diego, then, in February 1946 steamed to San Francisco where she decommissioned on 11 July 1946. LSM‚Äì175 received one battle star for World War II service. =1950-1955= LSM-175 about to enter the well of the in San Diego Bay in early 1951. Reactivated four years later, LSM‚Äì175 was recommissioned on 8 September 1950. Homeported at San Diego, she trained marines and seabees in amphibious operations. On 30 June 1955 she was transferred to the 11th Naval District. On 30 October 1955 she was decommissioned and placed in service. Disarmed and with a reduced crew, the LSM then took up logistic support of the islands in that district. Homeported at Long Beach in October 1956, and renamed USS Oceanside (LSM-175) on 14 October 1959, she served the 11th Naval District until 1 February 1961, when she was placed out of service and struck from the Naval Vessel Register. =Vietnam and Philippine Navy, 1961-1989= The ship was transferred to the custody of South Vietnam on 1 August 1961 to serve in the Republic of Vietnam Navy as RVNS Huong Giang (HQ-404). After the fall of Saigon on 30 April 1975, Huong Giang, under Commander L∆∞∆°ng, escaped to the Philippines as part of a flotilla of Vietnam Navy ships under the overall leadership of Navy Captain Kh∆∞∆°ng H·ªØu B√°. Huong Giang sailed to Subic Bay, where custody was transferred to the Philippines on 17 November 1975. The Philippine Navy renamed her BRP Batanes (LP65). The ship was disposed of in 1989.

He played both Major League Baseball as a right-handed pitcher for the Philadelphia Phillies (seven games pitched over two seasons, 1945‚Äì1946) and NBA basketball as a small forward/shooting guard for the Sheboygan Redskins (two games played during the 1949‚Äì1950 season). Grate was listed at tall and . College career Born in Greenfield, Ohio and nicknamed \\"Buckeye\\", Grate was a two-sport star at the Ohio State University, lettering in both baseball and basketball in the 1944 and 1945 seasons. As a pitcher, he had career totals of 95 strikeouts and only 25 walks in just 89 innings pitched. In basketball Grate was a two-time all- Big Ten selection and earned All-America honors as a senior after scoring 272 points in 21 games. He was the captain of the 1944 team, leading the Buckeyes to a conference championship. Grate was inducted into the Ohio State Varsity O Hall of Fame in 1996. Professional baseball In baseball Grate was known for his throwing arm, including throwing the ball . He appeared with the Phillies during each of his first two pro seasons, splitting both 1945 and 1946 between the Phils and their Class A Eastern League farm club, the Utica Blue Sox. He was treated very roughly during his 1945 trial with Philadelphia, surrendering 16 runs, all earned, 18 hits, and 12 walks in 8 innings pitched over four appearances. He won 14 games for Utica in 1946, prompting a September call-up to the Majors, during which he was far more effective. He pitched three shutout innings of relief during his first two appearances, and was credited with his only MLB win on September 22 against the New York Giants at Shibe Park. In his final big-league game, six days later, he allowed only one run in five innings pitched, also against the Giants. In seven MLB games and 16 innings pitched, all in relief, Grate allowed 22 hits, 17 earned runs, and 14 bases on balls, with eight strikeouts. He had a long minor league career, playing for 13 seasons (1945‚Äì1957), winning 50 of 88 decisions as a pitcher and converting to an outfielder and third baseman in 1951 to take advantage of his skill as a hitter. He batted over .300 several times. Professional basketball In addition to his time playing baseball, Grate had also spent some time playing for the Indianapolis Kautskys for the National Basketball League. Grate later appeared in two games for the 1949‚Äì1950 Sheboygan Red Skins in the NBA, with one field goal and two points in six attempted shots.

The thickest varves are close to 2 cm thick. A rhythmite consists of layers of sediment or sedimentary rock which are laid down with an obvious periodicity and regularity. They may be created by annual processes such as seasonally varying deposits reflecting variations in the runoff cycle, by shorter term processes such as tides, or by longer term processes such as periodic floods. Rhythmites serve a significant role in unraveling prehistoric events, providing insights into sea level change, glaciation change, and earth's orbital variations which serve to answer questions about climate change. Annually-laminated rhythmites Annually-laminated deposits (varves) are rhythmites with annual periodicity: annual layers of sediment or sedimentary rock are laid down through seasonal variations that result from precipitation, or from temperature, which influences precipitation rates and debris loads in runoff. Of the many rhythmites found in the geological record, varves are among the most important and illuminating to studies of past climate change. Varves are amongst the finest resolution events easily recognised in stratigraphy. Periodically laminated rhythmites Lowden in the Walla Walla valley. Note distinct layers. Rhythmites may be deposited with periodicities other than annual. The geologic record captures both more frequent events (e.g., tides) and less frequent events (glacial floods). =Tidal rhythmites= Geologic tidal rhythmites display layered Carboniferous Period beds which record tidal cyclical events such as semi-diurnal, diurnal or neap tide, spring tide cycle. The geologic record captures layered beds comparable to those found currently in sediments in the Bay of Fundy in Canada and the Bay of Mont Saint-Michel in France. The Storm Mountain area of Big Cottonwood Canyon, Utah, has rhythmites which record sea-level sedimentary deposit fluctuations consistent with the cycle of the tides. =Proglacial rhythmites= One common mechanism is the episodic flooding which results from glacial dam bursts. In one such example geologists estimate that the Missoula Floods cycle of flooding and reformation of the lake took an average of 55 years and that the floods occurred approximately 40 times over the 2,000-year period between 15,000 and 13,000 years ago. Distinct rhythmites with an approximately 55-year periodicity have been observed. =Glacial epicycle rhythmites= Sea-level changes which correspond to the glacial periods also show up as extremely long-term rhythmites. As an example, the ice surge in the Quaternary resulted in changes in sea level of 127 meters to 163 meters. The regression and transgression of the sea level from waxing and waning glaciers have been identified in the rhythmites of the Pennsylvanian and Permian periods.

Plot  Animal experimentation footage is shown, followed by a video of a man dismembering a female body in a bathtub. It is implied that the man masturbates after the corpse has been sufficiently mutilated. Next, someone browses and clicks on the link for \\"Snuff Fantasy\\". Images of animals and people (mostly women) being tortured and killed clutter the screen, followed by a real life video of a pig being stabbed in the throat, squealing and bleeding out. A critic asks \\"Until what point are you willing to watch? In other words, what do you want to watch?\\" A wrists-bound-behind-her-back, tightly cleave-gagged, barefoot and crying woman in her bra and panties (Victim 102) is shown in a bathroom. She manages to force the gag out of her mouth, gets up and moves the shower's curtain. She then screams at what she sees. The film now goes back one week (in black and white footage), and shows a female journalist (aka Victim 102, portrayed by Yamila Greco) doing her morning routines and watching a newscast about a recently captured serial killer of prostitutes. This inspires the journalist to write about violence itself. The reporter accesses the pornographic and shock websites frequented by the killer (being greatly disturbed by their content) and interviews a film critic and author (Eduardo Poli), who discusses topics such as misogyny, fetishes, new media, morality, pornography, snuff, and the value of human life. Intercut with the reporter's research are scenes of her and two other women (a pregnant prostitute and a porn star) being filmed as they are tortured by a masked man (portrayed by Rodrigo Bianco) who labels his captives 100, 101, and 102. The pregnant woman (Victim 100, portrayed by Andrea Alfonso) is the first to be brutalized. All the while, Victims' 101 and 102 are screaming and moaning through their tightly gagged mouths. Accompanying their gagged moaning is an industrial music score by El Hemisferio Derecho. Victim 100 is beaten, several of her fingers are cut off and a bag is pulled over her head, which is stomped and kicked repeatedly. The masked killer gropes Victim 100, stomps her stomach, bites one of her nipples off, mutilates her genitals with a chef knife, and proceeds to cut her open with the knife. Before moving on, the masked killer then removes the gag of Victim 102 and orally rapes her with the same chef knife while also masturbating. He then reapplies her gag and drags Victim 100 to the bathroom. With the killer now out of sight, Victim 102 flings from the trash-laden floor a shard of glass, held by her toes, to her hands bound behind her to start cutting the rope that binds her wrists to the back of the chair. Coming out of the bathroom, the killer now goes to work on the porn star (Victim 101, portrayed by Silvia Paz). He beats her with a hammer, rips one of her eyes out, asphyxiates her with a bag, knocks her front teeth out with a chisel, and urinates on and rapes her. While the masked killer is taking Victim 101 apart with a hacksaw, the journalist is desperately trying to free her bare feet from the legs of the chair with her still-bound-behind her-hands. A flashback reveals that she was taken when she found hidden photographs depicting the film critic engaging in necrophilia. (The film critic and the masked killer are discovered to be partners in their sick fantasies.) Now freed from the chair, the still wrists bound-behind-her and gagged journalist escapes from the masked killer to the bathroom and manages to lock the door. Now... returning to the bathroom sequence from the beginning of the film, it is shown that the journalist discovered Victim 100 in the shower. The woman is still alive; something the masked killer rectifies when he breaks into the room, and at first bludgeons Victim 102 with a hammer (temporarily stunning her) but then bludgeons Victim 100 to death. The masked killer then drags the journalist out of the room with a hook impaling her belly, and as he prepares to kill her, she breaks the ropes binding her hands with another shard of glass on the floor, grabs a cellphone, and runs off. The cellphone will not work, so the journalist tries to find a way out as the masked killer searches for her, machete in hand. The journalist squeezes out a barred window, and is chased into the woods by the masked killer, who catches her. As he strangles her, the journalist grabs a rock, beats the masked killer with it, and then finishes him off with his discarded machete. The journalist stumbles away, and is picked up by a passing motorist.

Reception  A score of six out of seven was awarded by Independent Flicks, which said Snuff 102 was disturbing, with good special effects, and cinematography and a soundtrack that were successful in creating a deeply unsettling and creepy atmosphere. The film was similarly praised by Horror News and Subtitled Hell. While The Worldwide Celluloid Massacre admitted the film was intense, the website went on to say \\"it doesn't add up to anything\\" and that it suffered from an uninteresting plot and \\"idiotic\\" attempts at intellectual provocation. Snuff 102 was held in contempt by Soiled Sinema, which heavily criticized the acting, and called it \\"a bastardizing mess\\" and \\"a boring fucking film\\".

Plot  In Pompeii 79AD, Glaucus and Jone are in love with each other. Arbaces, the Egyptian High Priest, is determined to conquer her. Glaucus buys the blind slave Nydia who is mishandled by her owner. Nydia falls in love with him and asks Arbaces for his help. He gives her a potion to make Glaucus fall in love with him. In fact it is a poison which will destroy his mind. Arbaces' disciple Apoecides threatens to reveal publicly his wrongdoings. Arbaces kills him and accuses Glaucus of the crime. He locks Nydia in a cellar to prevent her from speaking. Glaucus is condemned to be thrown to the lions. Nydia manages to escape and tells Glaucus' friend Claudius what happened. Claudius rushes to the Circus to accuse Arbaces and the crowd decides that Arbaces and not Glaucus should be thrown to the lions. Then, Vesuvius starts erupting and a widespread panic ensues. Under the shock, Glaucus recovers his mind.

The municipality includes other villages like Torralba del Moral.  Etymology  Its name derives from the Arabic 'madƒ´nat salƒ´m', which was named after the Masmuda Berber family of the Banu Salim.Ancient Roman gate. History Situated at the confluence of the rivers Jal√≥n and Arbujuelo, Medinaceli was the site of the Celtiberian town known as Occilis or Okilis. From the Roman era until 1994, its saltworks were exploited for commercial use. During the Middle Ages, the town lay on the border between the lands of the Christians and those of the Moors. Main sights The Toro Jubilo annually occurs in Medinaceli, in which crowds of participants taunt a bull with balls of burning tar or turpentine (called \\"pitch\\") attached to its horns. Medinaceli is home to the only three-gated Roman arch in Spain, built in the 1st-3rd centuries AD. The arch is used as Spain Historic site symbol throughout the country. The castle of Medinaceli served as the residence of the Dukes of Medinaceli until the Ducal Palace (Palacio Ducal) was used for this purpose. Other buildings include the Colegiata de Nuestra Se√±ora de la Asunci√≥n, whose abbots fought with the bishops of Sig√ºenza to maintain the city's rights. The Convent of Saint Elizabeth (16th century) (Convento de Santa Isabel), which lies next to the church of San Mart√≠n, also stands in good condition. The beaterio (house inhabited by lay sisters) of San Rom√°n (Saint Romanus) is in ruins; it may have previously been a synagogue. Moorish- era remains include a stone gate, one of the few remains of the ancient city walls. The town is also listed as a Camping Aire, suitable for motorhomes, in Vicarious Media \\"All the Aires in Spain\\". The aire is on a plateau next to a small water tower and affords magnificent panoramic views. The town is a very short walk from the aire.

The bull is then released in the square, which has five lit bonfires symbolizing five martyrs.Toro Jubilo Animal rights group PACMA has described the fiesta as \\"a clear example of animal mistreatment\\" and PETA has called it \\"a sadistic festival\\".PETA, Bulls Tortured With Fire in Sadistic Spanish Festival!

An Indian classical musician and younger brother of Inayat Khan, he became the representative of the International Sufi Movement on the latter's death in 1927. Life Maula Bakhsh (1833 - 1896) Their grandfather Maula Bakhsh recognized his ability in improvisation and trained him in music with Inayat. As he grew up Maheboob was exposed more to European music than Inayat had been, he conducted and took some interest in Western musical theory. When Inayat began to travel from Baroda, he entrusted his musical students to Maheboob, but when Inayat sailed to the West in 1910 Maheboob Khan accompanied him.The Columbia Sourcebook of Muslims in the United States by Edward E. Curtis IV. Columbia University Press 2007 p. 48 He settled in The Hague, marrying a Dutch disciple, Shadbiy van Goens, who bore him two children, Raheemunnisa and Mahmood.

Published Taylor & Francis, 2000 p. 563 Maheboob had a particularly strong voice, but Maheboob, musical, intelligent, thoughtful and retiring, would rarely sing for others. There is a story that Inayat and his brother Ali Khan would sometimes pretend to go out, slamming the front door, then wait quietly in the front hall to hear Maheboob practise his singing. He composed more than 60 sacred songs. Barbara Blatherwick, the coloratura soprano, performed his songs in her recital in 1937 at the New York Town Hall.The New York Times. 6 January 1937 Maheboob composed a song on a sacred poem by Inayat Khan ('Before You judge.') but could not bring himself to show it to his brother who died without having heard it.

It sat at an altitude of and had a population of 2,800 in 1967. It was the administrative center of the Fiq District of Al Quneitra. In and after the Six-Day War in June 1967, it was evacuated. The Israeli settlement of Kibbutz Afik was built close by. History =Classical antiquity= Fiq was an ancient town, covering about 100 dunams on an artificial mound. Many inscriptions in Latin and Greek have been found.Dauphin, 1998, p. 722 =Early Muslim period= Fiq was located on one of the few routes connecting the Galilee and the Golan Heights, all part of the very important network of roads between Egypt and Syria. The lower part of the road followed the \\"Ascent of Fiq\\" (Arabic: 'Aqabat Fiq).Sharon 2004, p. 217 Once it reached the plateau, the road passed through different villages, the branch going through Fiq leading eastwards to the Hauran region rather than northeastwards to Damascus. An inscription found near Fiq dating to 692 credits the Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik () and his uncle Yahya ibn al-Hakam for leveling the \\"aqaba\\" (presumably Aqabat Fiq) for the inauguration of a new road connecting the Umayyad capital Damascus with Jerusalem.Sharon 2004, pp. 104‚Äì105 It is the oldest known Arabic inscription acknowledging the building of a road during the Islamic period. =Ayyubid period= The Ayyubids built a caravanserai at Aqabat Fiq in the early 13th century called Khan al-'Aqabah, whose ruins are still visible. Around 1225, during Ayyubid rule, the Syrian geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi noted that the convent of Dayr Fiq was much venerated by Christians, and still frequented by travellers.Le Strange, 1890, p. 429 =Ottoman period= In 1596 Fiq appeared in the Ottoman tax registers as part of the nahiya of Jawlan Garbi in the Qada of Hauran. It had an entirely Muslim population consisting of 16 households and 9 bachelors. Taxes were paid on wheat, barley, summer crops, olive trees, goats and/or beehives.H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 196. In 1806, the German explorer Seetzen found that Fiq had 100 houses made of basalt, four them the inhabited by Christians and the rest by Muslims. In 1875, the French explorer Victor Gu√©rin found that Fiq was divided into four quarters, each administered by its own sheik. Most of the homes contained remnants of ancient buildings. The village had abundant of fresh water.Gu√©rin, 1880, pp 314-5 ff When Gottlieb Schumacher surveyed the area in the 1880s, he described Fiq as a large village with about 400 people. It had around 160 \\"tolerably\\" well-built stone houses, but only 90 of those were inhabited.Schumacher, 1888, p. 136-7 ff =1967 village= At the time of its depopulation in 1967, the city had a population of approximately 2,800. Archaeology and possible mention in the Bible The name Aphek refers to one or several locations mentioned by the Hebrew Bible as the scenes of a number of battles between the Israelites and the Arameans. Most famously, a town near which one or more rulers of Damascus named Ben- hadad, were defeated by the Israelites and in which the Damascene king and his surviving soldiers found a safe place of retreat (; ). Since the turn of the 20th century the predominant opinion is that the location of all these battles is one and the same, and that the town lay east of the Jordan. Initially it was thought that the name is preserved in the now depopulated village of Fiq near Kibbutz Afik, three miles east of the Sea of Galilee, where an ancient mound, Tell Soreg, had been identified. Excavations by Moshe Kochavi and Pirhiya Beck in 1987-88 have indeed discovered a fortified 9th- and 8th- century BCE settlement, probably Aramean, but Kochavi considered it to be too small to serve the role ascribed to Aphek in the Bible.The Golan Heights: A Battlefield of the Ages, LA Times, 11 September 1988Shuichi Hasegawa, Aram and Israel during the Jehuite Dynasty, Tel Soreg, p. 72 The site most favoured now by the archaeologists is Tel 'En Gev/Khirbet el-'Asheq, a mound located within Kibbutz Ein Gev.

The city lies along the route between Antioch and Aleppo, and has been around since the Byzantine era. The castle was originally Byzantine and was built by Nicephorus shortly after 959, it then fell to the Arabs and then to the Seljuk Turks. In 1097 it was taken by the Crusaders, who kept it for the next forty years, except for a short time in 1098 when it was taken by the Muslim Arabs. After Nur al-Din's victory over Raymond of Poitiers at the Battle of Inab, the castle fell to Muslim forces in 1149.William of Tyre, XVII.10 It was taken back by the Crusaders under Baldwin III in 1158.William of Tyre, XVIII.19 However, Nur al-Din besieged the castle once more in 1164. When the Crusaders attempted to relieve the siege, Nur al-Din defeated them decisively at the Battle of Harim, capturing many of the Christian leadership including Raymond III of Tripoli, Bohemond III of Antioch, Hugh VIII of Lusignan, and Joscelin III of Edessa.William of Tyre, XIX.9 After this, the castle remained in Muslim hands for the remainder of the Crusader period, though Count Philip I of Flanders unsuccessfully attempted to recapture it one last time during his pilgrimage to the east in 1177.William of Tyre, XXI.19 and 25 When the Mongols invaded in the 13th century, much of Harem was destroyed including its castle. What is left of the castle dates back to the Muslim - Crusader battles between 1164 and 1268. The crusader castle was rebuilt by the son of Saladin, Malik Al Zaher Ghazi.http://www.syriagate.com/Syria/about/cities/Idlib/ariha.htm As part of the Syrian Civil War, Islmist rebels have taken complete control of the town. =Syrian Civil War= During the Syrian Civil War, the town remained loyal to the Syrian government led by Bashar al-Assad before surrendering to the Islamist militants. By late 2014, Harem had become the local headquarters for al-Nusra Front, the Syrian affiliate of Al-Qaeda. On 24 January 2016, Ahrar ash-Sham expelled al-Nusra Front from the Syrian town of Harem, after tensions between the two groups boiled over. Subsequent clashes erupted in the nearby town of Salqin. Climate Due to Harem's location being very close to Aleppo, the climate is very similar. Below is the climate table for Aleppo, because there is no climate data concerning Harem.

The film was selected as the Polish entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 70th Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.Margaret Herrick Library, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Plot One of Stuhr's four characters: a priest with his daughter. The four characters played by Jerzy Stuhr all arrive at the same place at different times in different vehicles: a college professor in his own car, a priest in a taxicab, an army officer in a government vehicle and a prisoner in a police van accompanied by two police officers. As the opening credits roll, the four characters walk about the same building. The professor collects the written exams of his students, and is surprised that one, Ewa Bielska, has written on hers, \\"I love you.\\" He resists her advances but eventually gives in. For a crucial oral exam with the dean, Ewa asks for the professor's help, because she doesn't know anything at all. When the time comes, Ewa decides to resign, and the dean jokes with the professor that this is Poland, not America, and he wouldn't have been kicked out for having an affair with a student. The priest is at the confessional when a young girl shows up claiming to be his daughter. Her story checks out: he knows her mother from Radom, 11 years ago. The mother died six years ago, the girl says. The girl returns to the orphanage she escaped from. Soon the parish learns but wants the priest to stay on. At the end, he decides to quit the church to be a father to his daughter. The army officer, Colonel Mata≈Çowski of the Polish Land Forces, goes home to a house where almost everything is under lock and key, even the fridge and he is estranged from his wife. An old love shows up, Tamara. They have drinks and talk about their love letters. His superiors disapprove of the affair because she's Russian. Mata≈Çowski sees her one last time, driving her to the train station. Colonel Mata≈Çowski sees his old love, Tamara, for the first time in a long time. The prisoner, Zdzis≈Çaw Filip, is convicted of trafficking Pakistani heroin and sentenced to five years in jail and a fine of 5,000 zloty. As the police haul him away, he tells his wife Kryska to go to hell. Four years later, during a conjugal visit, Zdis≈Çaw gives her directions to the buried cash by tapping on her back. Kryska finds the money, but instead of using it to pay Zdis≈Çaw's fine, she tries to leave the country. Zdis≈Çaw is upset but claims to have expected her to do that. Since he can't pay the fine, he has to spend another two years in jail. All four characters wind up at one point seeing a man in an archives. The teacher and the colonel both go down an elevator and are left alone in a long corridor. Cast *Jerzy Stuhr - The university teacher / The priest / Col.

It was created c. 1138, or 1139, by the scribe named M√°el Brigte √∫a M√°el √öanaig, in Armagh. The codex includes the Latin text of the Gospels, along with glosses and prefatory material. There are also several inscriptions in Irish. Composition There are 156 vellum folios along with 2 parchment and 2 paper flyleaves which are not counted in the official foliation. The leaves are 165 mm by 120 mm. The text is contained in area of 120 mm by 70 mm. The text is written in an Irish minuscule hand. The binding of red leather with gilt tooling is post-medieval. Contents In addition to the text of the Gospels, the manuscript includes several pieces of prefatory material. The Genealogy of Jesus found at the beginning of the Gospel of Matthew (Matthew 1:1-17) is treated as a separate work than the rest of Matthew and is separated from the main text of Matthew. The prefatory material includes: Jerome's prologue to the Vulgate translation of the Bible (folio 1r), the prologue to the Gospel of Matthew (folio 3r), the Genealogy of Jesus from Matthew (folio 4v), a list of interpretations of the Syriac and Hebrew names found in the Gospels (folio 4v), a poem in Irish on the Three Magi (folio 5v), the prologues to the Gospels of Mark (folio 6r), Luke (folio 6v) and John (folio 7v), a prologue to the four Gospels in which the evangelist are compared to other groupings of four such as the four seasons and the four elements, and a poem in Irish on the appearance and manner of death of Christ and the Twelve Apostles (folio 9v). The gospel prologues do not precede each gospel, as in many other insular manuscripts, but are gathered together with other prefatory material. Following the prefatory material, the Gospel of Matthew starts at the beginning of the Nativity narrative at Matthew 1:18 (folio 10r), and is followed by the complete texts of the Gospels of Mark (folio 61r), Luke (folio 87r) and John (folio 128r). At the end of each Gospel there are colophons which identify the scribe and give some information about him. He is identified as M√°el Brigte √∫a M√°el √öanaig and he was writing in Armagh in his twenty-eighth year. M√°el Brigte alludes to various contemporary events, such as the killing of Cormac Mac C√°rthaig by Toirdelbach Ua Briain which allow the writing of the manuscript to be dated to 1138. Marginal and interlinear glosses and notes were added in the 13th century. Style The manuscript is decorated in Insular style. Although the high point of Insular style was centuries before the production of this manuscript, this manuscript is an example of the enduring appeal of the Insular style in Ireland. The decoration in the manuscript includes two full page miniatures of Evangelist symbols, the lion of Mark (folio 60) and the ox of Luke (folio 86). In both of the miniatures, the artist has solved the problem presented by placing horizontally oriented animals in the space of the vertically oriented page by turning the animals ninety degrees so that they seem to walk up the page. Both symbols are abstracted, placed against an abstract multi-colored background, and contained within a thick border made of decorated panels. There are also four large zoomorphic initials in the manuscript; at the beginning of the Nativity of Christ in the Gospel of Matthew (Matthew 1:18, folio 10r), and the beginning of each of the other Gospels (folios 61r, 87r, and 128r). There are smaller initials at beginning of each section of the prefatory material, and at important texts within the Gospel, including the Pater Noster in Matthew (folio 19r), the Magnificat in the Luke (folio 88r), and the beginning of the Resurrection sequence in Luke. Other initials in the manuscript are highlighted in color. All of the decoration in the manuscript is done in green, red, brown, and yellow washes. History The manuscript was in the Biblioth√®que du Roi in Paris by the early 18th century, when it was described as being part of library by P√®re Richard Simon in his Biblioth√®que critique in 1708. It was stolen from the Biblioth√®que du Roi in 1707, along with other manuscripts by Jean Aymon. Aymon took to Holland where it was purchased by Robert Harley. It remained part of the Harley Collection, which was purchased in 1753 by Act of Parliament and became one of the foundational collections for the British Library.

Blancan North American Stage. GeoWhen Database. Version 1.1.0. Retrieved 2017-June-26. It is usually considered to start in the early-mid Pliocene Epoch and end by the early Pleistocene. The Blancan is preceded by the Hemphillian and followed by the Irvingtonian NALMA stages. As usually defined, it corresponds to the mid-Zanclean through Piacenzian and Gelasian stages in Europe and Asia. In California, the Blancan roughly corresponds to the mid-Delmontian through Repettian and Venturian to the very early Wheelerian. The Australian contemporary stages are the mid-Cheltenhamian through Kalimnan and Yatalan. In New Zealand, the Opoitian starts at roughly the same time and the Blancan is further coeval with the Waipipian and Mangapanian stages to the early Nukumaruan. Finally, in Japan the Blancan starts coeval with the late Yuian, runs alongside the Totomian and Suchian and ends soon after the start of the Kechienjian. Dating issues The start date of the Blancan has not been fully established. There is general agreement that it is between 4.9 and 4.3 mya (million years ago). The often-cited GeoWhen database places it at 4.75 mya. There is even stronger disagreement about the end of the Blancan. Some stratigraphers argue for the 1.808 mya date that corresponds better with the end of the Pliocene and the start of the Pleistocene (1.808 mya). This conforms with the extinction of Borophagus, Hypolagus, Paenemarmota, Plesippus, Nannippus, and Rhynchotherium faunal assemblage between 2.2 and 1.8 mya. Other paleontologists find continuity of the faunal assemblages well into the Pleistocene, and argue for an end date of 1.2 mya. This corresponds with the extinction of stegomastodons and related species and the appearance of mammoths in southern North America. Fauna The middle of the Blancan, about 2.7 mya, is when the land bridge connection between North and South America was reestablished and taxa like sloths and glyptodonts appeared in North America at the height of the Great American Interchange. =Notable mammals= Artiodactyla ‚Äì even-toed ungulates * Platygonus, peccaries Carnivora ‚Äì carnivores *Arctotherium?, giant short-faced bear *Hesperocyoninae, dog-like carnivores * Borophagus, bone-crushing dogs *Canis, wolves * Chasmaporthetes, hyenas *Smilodon, saber-toothed cat *Homotherium, saber-toothed cat *Xenosmilus, saber-toothed cat Lagomorpha ‚Äì lagomorphs * Hypolagus, rabbits Perissodactyla ‚Äì odd-toed ungulates * Nannippus, horses * Plesippus, horses ‚Äì may belong into Equus Proboscidea * Rhynchotherium, gomphotheres * Stegomastodon, gomphotheres Rodentia ‚Äì rodents * Paenemarmota, giant marmots =Notable birds= Cathartidae ‚Äì New World vultures * Sarcoramphus kernense, Kern Vulture Charadriiformes * unknown scolopacid (archaic calidrid or turnstone?)

It is a retelling of stories from Metamorphoses by the Roman poet Ovid, set to rock music by Joan Baez and Mick Jagger and narration by Paul Frees. In all of its five parts, the protagonists are portrayed in the form of a recurring boy and girl. The movie was the between American golden age of Disney-influenced anime and Sanrio's second animated release in the US (following their adaptation of The Mouse and His Child the previous year). Over 170 animators, all employed in Hollywood, worked on it for three years. Metamorphoses tried to be the rock era's answer to Fantasia, but its original run was critically reviled and closed as soon as it opened. According to many of its crew, many problems with the production, music and plotting were to blame. On May 3, 1979, it was reissued under a new title, Winds of Change, with seven minutes trimmed from the first cut of 89 minutes. This time, the music was composed by Alec R. Costandinos, the disco songs were sung by Arthur Simms and Pattie Brooks and narration by Peter Ustinov was added. The five parts‚Äî\\"Actaeon\\", \\"Orpheus and Eurydice\\", \\"The House of Envy\\", \\"Perseus\\" and \\"Pha√´ton\\", in the original order‚Äîwere re- arranged and slightly renamed for the new version; the third and last parts remained unmoved. In the Winds cut, the first two were now \\"Perseus\\" and \\"Actaeon\\", and the fourth \\"Orpheus\\". In addition, the boy was now called Wondermaker, and the girl played different characters in every segment.

It serves grades 9-12. SBSC was formerly known as Spring Branch High School (SBHS), which was the first high school in the district. The high school opened in 1948 with an initial enrollment of a few hundred students. By the late 1950s and early 1960s, the school's enrollment was exceeding its capacity and causing overcrowding. In response, the school district opened Memorial High School (MHS) in 1962 on the other side of Old Katy Road. Enrollment at SBHS however, continued to grow. Another high school, Spring Woods High School, opened in 1964. Northbrook High School opened in 1974 to ease additional overcrowding at Spring Branch and Spring Woods. By the mid-1980s, a decline in the school-age population across the district caused a decrease in enrollment at all high schools in the district. The district's board of trustees voted to close both SBHS and Westchester High School at the end of the 1984-85 school year. Most students who previously attended SBHS were rezoned to Northbrook and Spring Woods. Some SBHS students were rezoned to MHS. SBSOC was then opened in the former SBHS building as an alternative school for students not suited to the district's more traditional schools. Many of the buildings that had made up SBHS were torn down in 2015 so that a new facility for the SBSC could be built in its place. A museum containing memorabilia from the former SBHS opened in October 2017 on the site of the old school's library.

His estate, Rancho Camulos, is registered as a National Historic Landmark.  Early life  Del Valle was born in Jalisco, Mexico. His father, Antonio del Valle, was a soldier in the Spanish army who came to California in 1819 and was mayordomo (administrator and/or foreman) of Mission San Fernando Rey de Espa√±a. Ygnacio joined the army as a cadet in 1825 at the Presidio of Santa Barbara. In 1828 he was promoted to second lieutenant and transferred to the Presidio of San Diego. In 1832, his commander became involved in a power struggle with the commandant of the Presidio of Monterey, where Antonio served. Ygnacio's side won the conflict on the battlefield, causing a rift between father and son, and they never spoke again. Ygnacio then moved to the Monterey Presidio and was in charge of the secularization of Mission Santa Cruz and Mission San Francisco de As√≠s. He became a trusted officer, enough to be left in charge of the Presidio in Jos√© Figueroa's absence. For his service to the Mexican Army, del Valle received the Rancho El Tejon land grant in 1843. During this time, he married Maria de Los Angeles Carrillo in 1842.  Ranchos  Antonio died in 1841 without leaving a will. On his deathbed, he decided he wanted to reconcile with his son and, in a letter, offered Ygnacio several properties, including the Rancho San Francisco land grant he had received. Unfortunately, he died before the letter was delivered to Ygnacio, but the son returned to the family homestead to administer the ranch anyway. Without a will specifying how the estate was to be divided, Jacoba Feliz, Antonio's second wife who remarried after his death, filed a lawsuit to claim part of the land, which was the site the first recorded discovery of gold in California, sparking a minor gold rush in 1842, six years before the more famous California Gold Rush. Eventually, the lawsuit was decided and the land was split, with Ygnacio receiving the Rancho Camulos. However, del Valle did not live on this land initially, instead residing in the Olvera Street area of Los Angeles, where he was active in local politics. In the 1840s, he served on the junta (the equivalent of a city council) as a member and its secretary, as well as treasurer of civil government under Governor P√≠o Pico. In 1850, he was elected alcalde of Los Angeles and served only a short time before the city was incorporated as an American city, but during his tenure he established the Los Angeles Rangers, an early law enforcement group. After California achieved statehood later that year, del Valle served in the California State Assembly for a short period. He was elected to a one-year term in the Los Angeles Common Council in 1852. and was elected again in May 1856 but resigned in December of that year.Chronological Record of Los Angeles City Officials,1850-1938, compiled under direction of Municipal Reference Library, City Hall, Los Angeles (March 1938, reprinted 1966). \\"Prepared ... as a report on Project No. SA 3123-5703-6077-8121-9900 conducted under the auspices of the Works Progress Administration.\\" Marriage In 1852, at the age of 44, he married 15-year-old Ysabel Varela. Del Valle remained on the City Council for five years, after which he devoted his time to improving Rancho Camulos. The del Valle family, including five children, finally moved to the rancho in 1861. Ysabel del Valle was known to help poor and orphaned children and when then moved (to Rancho Camulos) she brought eight orphans to live with her family.  Later life  However, the late 1850s and early 1860s were difficult for ranchers in Southern California. Severe flooding had caused great damage to many ranchos. Despite this, the Del Valle family, like many Californios, continued to live beyond its means. Del Valle had to pay off the debts of his stepmother, Jacoba Feliz, in return for which received part of her land inheritance. He had already sold off his Rancho Tejon to pay his own debts as well. The winter floods of 1861-62 were followed by droughts which lasted for three years, which forced del Valle to sell off his remaining land. He was left with just 1,500 acres (6 km¬≤) of his Rancho Camulos, but the ranch survived these hard times and became a thriving operation, the source of the first commercially grown oranges in Ventura County. Through 1870, the del Valles had seven more children, although only five of the twelve would live to adulthood. One, Reginaldo, became the youngest-ever president of the California State Senate at age 28 and was instrumental in the preservation of Mission San Fernando, as well as the movement to have the El Camino Real marked with bells. Ygnacio del Valle died in 1880 and was buried on his rancho. Ysabel took over the running of rancho until 1900, then moved back to Los Angeles. In 1905, the ailing woman \\"refused to die\\" until she could be reunited with her long-dead husband. His remains were exhumed and moved to Los Angeles. Soon after their arrival, Ysabel died, and she was buried in the same coffin as Ygnacio. Their remains lie at Calvary Cemetery.

It was as Portcullis that Lant wrote Observations and Collections Concerning the Office and Officers of Arms describing the College as \\"a company full of discord and envy.\\" In 1595, Lant presented the queen a catalog of officers of arms known as Lant's Roll of which several copies survive. In 1596 Lant was involved in an argument with Ralph Brooke, York Herald of Arms in Ordinary. This led to Lant assaulting Brooke at the Middle Temple. Lant was created Windsor Herald of Arms in Ordinary on 23 October 1597. Lant's date of death is uncertain. He was alive on 26 December 1600 but is thought to have died early in 1601. He and his wife Elizabeth, daughter of Richard Houghton, had two children, a daughter and a son. The son, Thomas, was born after his father's death and died on 18 May 1688 as rector of Hornsey, Middlesex. Lant's wife remarried on 28 September 1609 at the Savoy Chapel, Westminster. The union was with the alchemist Francis Anthony, and the marriage licence describes her as being 36 years old and the widow of \\"Thomas Lant, gent., deceased eight years since.\\" Arms See also *Heraldry *Pursuivant *Herald References *Walter H.

Notice the old-fashioned dress of the woman, a hallmark of the Old Folks Concert. An Old Folks Concert was a form of musical and visual entertainment at which early American compositions by such composers as William Billings and Daniel Read were sung in period costume, while demonstrating early singing school methods. Old Folks Concerts began in the early 1850s in New England, spread in popularity throughout the United States by the 1860s, and continued to be performed into the 20th century. They are especially associated with Robert \\"Father\\" Kemp, who formed a traveling troupe to perform this music, and who published a collection of music known as Father Kemp's Old Folks' Concert Music. Singing schools developed in Northeastern United States in the late 18th century, and became a popular way for people to learn to sing, and for composers to share, the religious and patriotic music being written and notated using the new system of \\"patent notes\\" and taught using solfege. According to , the singing school movement spread west and south, but with the rise of the \\"Better Music Movement,\\" the singing schools went largely out of use in New England by the 1830s. According to , though, some in New England missed the \\"good old tunes,\\" giving rise to the Old Folks Concert which \\"revived the music and antiquated performance practices of the singing schools (p 602).\\" What apparently began as an informal and amateur activity in the early 1850s became a popular form of entertainment under the leadership of Robert \\"Father\\" Kemp by the mid and late 1850s, whose professional troupe toured the United States and even England with featured soloist Jenny Twitchell Kempton. quotes a writer (writing in 1959) for the Cincinnati Enquirer to indicate the reasons for the popularity of the Old Folks Concert: > Their music is of that kind which touches the heart and appeals to the > sympathies of every one. It calls to mind early associations long since > buried in the \\"dead past,\\" and revives the pleasantest recollections of the > spring-time of existence, when \\"life was full of sunny years,\\" and our > hearts free from the \\"mountains of care\\" which weigh them down in after > years. The Old Folks Concerts were an exercise in nostalgia. In addition to singing the old tunes, nostalgia was enhanced by the appearance of the singers in period costumes and advertisements written in the style of early American typography]. In addition to professional troupes, Old Folks Concerts were often arranged by amateur groups for fund-raising. For example, in 1872, the Diocese of Missouri's annual convention notes that \\"by the generous efforts of some warm hearted friends [such as] those antiquated ladies, who, in spite of the infirmities of age, came forth and at our request to assist us with an Old Folks' Concert, we have been enabled recently to reduce the accumulated debt under which [the diocesean-supported St. Luke's] Hospital has been struggling.\\" Father Kemp retired in 1868, but other troupes, according to , continued the Old Folks Concert tradition. As time went on, the language affectations of the concert posters and presenters become more pronounced, and the clothing all the more quaint, the music less religious. Like the minstrel show, says , the Old Folks Concerts began to lampoon an inaccessible rural past.

He was a founding member of the United Jazz + Rock Ensemble.  Biography  Volker Kriegel performing with United Jazz and Rock Ensemble in 1992 Kriegel was born in Darmstadt on 24 December 1943. He started playing the guitar at the age of 15. Kriegel studied sociology with Theodor Adorno, but in 1962 was already playing in a band with Albert and Emil Mangelsdorff in Frankfurt, and abandoned his studies. He was then in a fusion band led by vibraphonist Dave Pike, an American expatriate, and recorded the album Noisy Silence ‚Äì Gentle Noise (1969). Simultaneously, Kriegel started the Mild Maniac Orchestra. He recorded the album Keep on Driving (MPS, 1970) with Don \\"Sugarcane\\" Harris, then signed with MPS and released the jazz-rock album Spectrum (1971). Five years later he started the United Jazz + Rock Ensemble, a shifting collective which at various times included Charlie Mariano, Albert Mangelsdorff, Ack van Rooyen, and Barbara Thompson. In 1977 Kriegel co-founded the label Mood Records, which released his own music and that of the United Jazz + Rock Ensemble. Kriegel drifted from music and started writing children's books. \\"During the 1990s he ceased his activities as a leader and concentrated instead on working as a composer and on his longstanding second career as a cartoonist; his illustrations appeared in newspapers, magazines, books, and animated films.\\" Manchmal ist es besser, man sagt gar nix, a book containing some of his cartoons and writings on jazz and other topics, was published in 1998.

Equivalently, it is a perfect matching in the grid graph formed by placing a vertex at the center of each square of the region and connecting two vertices when they correspond to adjacent squares. Height functions For some classes of tilings on a regular grid in two dimensions, it is possible to define a height function associating an integer to the vertices of the grid. For instance, draw a chessboard, fix a node A_0 with height 0, then for any node there is a path from A_0 to it. On this path define the height of each node A_{n+1} (i.e. corners of the squares) to be the height of the previous node A_n plus one if the square on the right of the path from A_n to A_{n+1} is black, and minus one otherwise. More details can be found in . Thurston's height condition William Thurston (1990) describes a test for determining whether a simply- connected region, formed as the union of unit squares in the plane, has a domino tiling. He forms an undirected graph that has as its vertices the points (x,y,z) in the three-dimensional integer lattice, where each such point is connected to four neighbors: if x + y is even, then (x,y,z) is connected to (x + 1,y,z + 1), (x ‚àí 1,y,z + 1), (x,y + 1,z ‚àí 1), and (x,y ‚àí 1,z ‚àí 1), while if x + y is odd, then (x,y,z) is connected to (x + 1,y,z ‚àí 1), (x ‚àí 1,y,z ‚àí 1), (x,y + 1,z + 1), and (x,y ‚àí 1,z + 1). The boundary of the region, viewed as a sequence of integer points in the (x,y) plane, lifts uniquely (once a starting height is chosen) to a path in this three-dimensional graph. A necessary condition for this region to be tileable is that this path must close up to form a simple closed curve in three dimensions, however, this condition is not sufficient. Using more careful analysis of the boundary path, Thurston gave a criterion for tileability of a region that was sufficient as well as necessary. Counting tilings of regions A domino tiling of an 8√ó8 square using the minimum number of long-edge-to-long-edge pairs (1 pair in the center). This arrangement is also a valid Tatami tiling of an 8x8 square, with no four dominoes touching at an internal point. The number of ways to cover an m \\\\times n rectangle with \\\\frac{mn}{2} dominoes, calculated independently by and , is given by : \\\\prod_{j=1}^{\\\\lceil\\\\frac{m}{2}\\\\rceil} \\\\prod_{k=1}^{\\\\lceil\\\\frac{n}{2}\\\\rceil} \\\\left ( 4\\\\cos^2 \\\\frac{\\\\pi j}{m + 1} + 4\\\\cos^2 \\\\frac{\\\\pi k}{n + 1} \\\\right ). When both m and n are odd, the formula correctly reduces to zero possible domino tilings. A special case occurs when tiling the 2\\\\times n rectangle with n dominoes: the sequence reduces to the Fibonacci sequence . Another special case happens for squares with m = n = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, ... is :1, 2, 36, 6728, 12988816, 258584046368, 53060477521960000, ... . These numbers can be found by writing them as the Pfaffian of an mn \\\\times mn skew-symmetric matrix whose eigenvalues can be found explicitly. This technique may be applied in many mathematics-related subjects, for example, in the classical, 2-dimensional computation of the dimer-dimer correlator function in statistical mechanics. The number of tilings of a region is very sensitive to boundary conditions, and can change dramatically with apparently insignificant changes in the shape of the region. This is illustrated by the number of tilings of an Aztec diamond of order n, where the number of tilings is 2(n + 1)n/2. If this is replaced by the \\"augmented Aztec diamond\\" of order n with 3 long rows in the middle rather than 2, the number of tilings drops to the much smaller number D(n,n), a Delannoy number, which has only exponential rather than super-exponential growth in n. For the \\"reduced Aztec diamond\\" of order n with only one long middle row, there is only one tiling. File:Diamant azteque.svgAn Aztec diamond of order 4, which has 1024 domino tilings File:Diamant azteque plein.svgOne possible tiling Tatami Tatami are Japanese floor mats in the shape of a domino (1x2 rectangle). They are used to tile rooms, but with additional rules about how they may be placed. In particular, typically, junctions where three tatami meet are considered auspicious, while junctions where four meet are inauspicious, so a proper tatami tiling is one where only three tatami meet at any corner (; ). The problem of tiling an irregular room by tatami that meet three to a corner is NP-complete . Degenerated space- filling curves  Any finite set of cells forming regular square grid n√ón can be indexed by a selected Space-filling curve that is consistent with squares (that do a recursive four-partition of the quadrilateral unit grid), with an index i ranging from 0 to n2-1. Geometrically, the curve can be drawn as a path through the center of the square cells. A domino tiling is obtained by merging neighboring cells. The index j of each domino will be obtained by the function j=floor(i √∑ 2) of the original grid index. The new fractal curve is a \\"degenerated curve\\" because is another fractal. Examples: center The \\"degenerated Morton space-filling curve\\" produces a regular horizontal- oriented domino tiling; the curve is related with Geohash indexing, where the Z-shape curve is transformed into a –ò-shape curve. The \\"degenerated Hilbert space-filling curve\\" produces an aperiodic tiling system, mixing horizontal- and vertical-oriented dominoes, 50% of each orientation. The degenerated Hilbert curve is isomorphic to the Munkres's fractal.The Munkres's fractal is defined at \\"Theorem 44.1\\" in faculty.etsu.edu/gardnerr/5357/notes/Munkres-44 See also *Gaussian free field, the scaling limit of the height function in the generic situation (e.g., inside the inscribed disk of a large aztec diamond) *Mutilated chessboard problem, a puzzle concerning domino tiling of a 62-square subset of the chessboard *Statistical mechanics References      * Category:Combinatorics Category:Exactly solvable models Category:Lattice models Category:Matching (graph theory) Category:Recreational mathematics Category:Statistical mechanics Category:Tiling puzzles ","title":"Domino tiling"},{"id":"10565505","title":"List of North American stadiums by capacity"},{"id":"10565569","text":"Serge Lehman (born July 12, 1964) is the primary pseudonym of French science fiction writer Pascal Fr√©jean.

September 1994, Czech police detained Yekta Uzunoglu (subsequently the officer in charge, Josef Opava, received a fourteen-year sentence as a member of the infamous \\"Berdych's gang\\"); his unlawful detention (Czech law allowed maximum 24 hours of detention) lasted nearly 72 hours without charges being laid. Afterwards, according to press statement from police officer Ji≈ô√≠ Gregor, accusations were made of \\"illegal arms and drugs trading\\" and Uzunoglu was remanded into custody. One month later, the previous charges were dropped, but more charges were brought of \\"preparing of murders, unlawful possession of guns, multiple frauds and torture\\"; these accusations had been laid by \\"G√∂ksel Otan\\", supposed Turkish citizen living in the Czech Republic. The case was litigated until 10 April 1995, when all accusations were proven to be false, except a count of torture. Purportedly Uzunoglu, with the help of other detainees, had tortured G√∂ksel Otan on 9 September and then two other people (one of them his own cousin), on the date he was detained. At this time, according to court files, one of the accused persons (Uzunoglu's nephew) had been already in custody for several hours. However, even this version of the lawsuit was not accepted by the responsible court. Meanwhile, Uzunoglu's remand was prolonged and Uzunoglu endured unlawful mistreatment, as then minister of justice Jan Ruml later confessed. Later in 1996, Uzunoglu received the German citizenship, although still in custody. During the ensuing trial, it was shown that \\"G√∂ksel Otan\\" was a false identity and that a false passport in that name had been used for at least 25 years. \\"G√∂ksel\\" admitted in court that his true name is \\"Gurkan G√∂nen\\". According to Ministry of interior inquiry, G√∂nen has been a long-term informer of communist STB and after Velvet revolution worked as an informer for cpt. Hor√°k, policeman leading the prosecution of Uzunoglu. A final version of the lawsuit, literally same as the one rejected in 1995, was filed on 18 January 2000. In January 2003, the charge moved to Turkey's jurisdiction, which subsequently returned it to the Czech court 9 months later. On 25 September 2003, the Czech court stopped prosecution of Uzunoglu for humanitarian reasons, but both the prosecutor and Uzunoglu would not accept this decision; the latter demanded to be cleared of all accusations. On 3 March 2006, important figures of the Czech public life published an open letter called \\"≈Ωalujeme\\" (\\"We accuse\\", similar to √âmile Zola's \\"J'accuse ...!\\", which helped end the infamous Dreyfus affair in France 100 years before), namely Pavel Dost√°l, T√°≈àa Fischerov√°, Franti≈°ek Janouch, Karel Jech, Kvƒõta Jechov√°, Svatopluk Kar√°sek, Jaroslav Ko≈ô√°n, Dana Nƒõmcov√°, Karel Schwarzenberg, Ji≈ôina ≈†iklov√°, Vƒõnƒõk ≈†ilh√°n, Libu≈°e ≈†ilh√°nov√°, Jarom√≠r ≈†tƒõtina, Petru≈°ka ≈†ustrov√°. In April 2006, Yekta Uzunoglu was presented the Franti≈°ek Kriegel prize for civic courage. In March 2007, Uzunoglu started an 11 days long hunger strike against his prolonged process, and many important public figures, including former president V√°clav Havel, joined him symbolically for one day. On 29 March 2007, Uzunoglu was sentenced to two years in prison, which he immediately appealed, describing it as \\"fashizoid\\" justice. Amnesty International declared their support of Uzunoglu. On 31 July 2007, Prague's Court of appeals heard the appeal and finally dropped all charges. On April 28, 2017, Yekta Uzunoglu was arrested in Prague, but the next day he was released. According to Uzunoglu himself, the Turkish Embassy in Prague is behind the initiative of the police. The Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic with its finding of 13 February 2018 issue: III. √öS 1920/17 Judge-Rapporteur prof. JUDr. Jan Filip CSc. stated that Yekta Uzunoglu's arrest on 28 April 2017 was unconstitutional.

After their return from the travel Uzunoglu shared some photographs from their visit on his Twitter page which were the same photographs that MEP Stetina posted on his personal Twitter account and these photos can also be found on official EU Parliament's web page. In January 2019 Turkey has issued an arrest warrant for Dr. Uzunoglu due to these photographs on his Twitter page. In order to prevent delivery of Uzunoglu, who is also a german citizen, to Turkey; Amnesty International, Members of European Parliement, Kurdish PEN club and many Czech famous personalities warned the German and the Czech governments.Yekta Uzunoglu with V√°clav Have l- 2006  See also  * Kurds in Turkey  References  Category:1953 births Category:Turkish people of Kurdish descent Category:Kurdish writers Category:Charles University alumni Category:Living people Category:Translators to Kurdish Category:Translators from Kurdish Category:Translators to Czech Category:Translators from Czech ","title":"Yekta Uzunoglu"},{"id":"10565614","text":"Charles Adiel Lewis Totten (February 3, 1851 ‚Äì April 12, 1908) was an American military officer, a professor of military tactics, a prolific writer, and an influential early advocate of British Israelism. Family Charles Totten was born in New London, Connecticut into a military family. His father, James Totten was a 1st lieutenant in the Army and would become a Brigadier-General in the Missouri Militia during the American Civil War. He was the grandfather of Lieutenant General William P. Ennis who served during World War II and the Korean War. He was not directly related to Brevet Major General Joseph Gilbert Totten, who was Chief of the United States Army Corps of Engineers from 1838 to 1864. Totten's brother, John Reynolds Totten, graduated from West Point in 1878, was promoted to first lieutenant in 1886 and resigned from the Army on April 1, 1891. After leaving the Army, he pursued his interests in genealogy and hereditary societies. Totten was appointed to the United States Military Academy at West Point on September 1, 1869. A year later, his father was dismissed from the Army for misconduct. Military career Charles A. L. Totten, ca. 1875 Totten graduated from West Point (where he had been an honor student) in June 1873. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 4th Artillery Regiment. He was promoted to first lieutenant the next year. He would not be promoted again, however, due to slow promotions in the post-Civil War Army. He taught military science and tactics at Massachusetts Agricultural College, (now known as the University of Massachusetts Amherst) from 1875 to 1878. In this assignment he introduced fencing as a collegiate sport. Charles Totten and W. R. Livermore are variously credited with being the first to bring the practice of wargaming from Germany to the United States. Totten's book Strategos, one of the first modern wargaming systems in the United States, was published in 1880. In 1881 Totten participated in the Chiricahua Campaign against the Apaches in Arizona. For this service, Totten was entitled to receive the Indian Campaign Medal when it was established in 1907. He was stationed at Fort Adams in Newport, Rhode Island from November 9, 1882 to August 1, 1883. He then served as Professor of Military Science and Tactics, Cathedral School of St. Paul in New York from August 4, 1883 until April 21, 1886. A strong opponent of the Metric System, he patented a system of weights and measures in 1884. He was again assigned to Fort Adams, as well as serving as an advisor at Rhode Island Militia encampments, from May 30, 1886 until October 1, 1889. His last assignment in the Army was as Professor of Military Science and Tactics at Yale University from August 1, 1889 until 1892. Writing and publishing After a leave of absence, Totten resigned his commission in August 1893 and settled in Milford, Connecticut with his office in New Haven. He devoted most of his remaining life to writing, chiefly on biblical chronology, biblical prophecy, the Great Pyramid, British Israelism, the symbolism of the Great Seal of the United States and other esoteric subjects. He was a prolific author, writing over 180 books and articles, including a massive 26 volume series entitled \\"Our Race\\" defending British Israelism, and his writings continue to exert influence in some Christian Zionist circles. Totten's works were read and embraced by Mary Baker Eddy, the founder of the Christian Science Church. As an active member of the International Institute for Preserving and Perfecting (Anglo-Saxon) Weights and Measures, Totten wrote its theme song, \\"A Pint's a Pound the World Around,\\" in 1883, which included these lines: At the second convention of the Anglo-Saxon Federation of America in 1931, Howard Rand announced that the federation had acquired Totten's unsold books along with cuts and printing plates from the Totten Memorial Trust. Rand used the federation to continue publishing Totten's work.

Nicaragua also has a maritime boundary dispute with Honduras in the Caribbean Sea and a boundary dispute over the Rio San Juan with Costa Rica.  Colombia  =San Andres y Providencia= The location of San Andres and Providencia in the Caribbean. In 1670 the English corsair Henry Morgan took over the islands until 1689. In 1803, after Spain's Viceroyalty of New Granada had been re-established in 1739, the archipelago and the province of Veraguas - covering the western territory of Panama and the eastern coast of Nicaragua - were added to its area of jurisdiction. In the later colonial era the territory was administered from the province of Cartagena. After the Republic of Gran Colombia gained independence in 1822, the inhabitants of the islands - who had been under the control of Louis-Michel Aury - voluntarily adhered to Gran Colombia, and control over them was transferred to the department of Magdalena. Subsequently, the United Provinces of Central America (UPCA) did not recognize the occupation of the islands and claimed ownership over them. Colombia in turn protested the UPCA's occupation of the eastern coast of modern-day Nicaragua. The UPCA federation dissolved in civil war between 1838‚Äì1840, and the resulting state of Nicaragua carried on with the dispute, as did the Republic of the New Granada (made up of modern Colombia and Panama) that emerged from the dissolution of Gran Colombia. Colombia later established a local administration (\\"intendencia\\") in the islands in 1912. The signing of the Esguerra-B√°rcenas treaty in 1928 between both governments temporarily resolved the dispute in favor of Colombia. (Colombia and Honduras signed a maritime boundary treaty in 1999 which implicitly accepted Colombian sovereignty over the islands.) However, since 1980, when the Sandinista government assumed power in Nicaragua, a constitutional reform was enacted and the treaty was renounced. Nicaraguans claimed that the treaty was signed under United States pressure and military occupation and thus did constitute a sovereign decision, while Colombia argued that the treaty's final ratification in 1930, when U.S. forces were already on their way out, confirmed its validity. In 2001 Nicaragua filed claims with the ICJ over the disputed maritime boundary involving in the Caribbean, which included the islands of San Andr√©s and Providencia. Colombia had claimed that the ICJ had no jurisdiction over the matter and had increased its naval and police presence in the islands. In a preliminary decision the Court sided with Colombia on the question of sovereignty over the islands () and agreed with Nicaragua that the 82nd meridian (West) is not a maritime border. On 19 November 2012, the ICJ decided this case by upholding Colombia's sovereignty over San Andres y Providencia, and other disputed islands. These included Quitasue√±o and Serrana, around which the court established territorial zones of in radius. The ICJ also expanded Nicaragua's maritime territory, thereby surrounding both island banks. The ICJ found that only one of 54 features identified by Nicaragua within Quitasue√±o Bank is an island at high tide. The ICJ considered that the use of enclaves achieved the most equitable solution. Fishermen worried that the court \\"had created 'enclaves' around Quitasue√±o and Serrana that could restrict the fishermen's longtime access there.\\"  Honduras  =The Gulf of Fonseca= The Gulf of Fonseca from space, July 1997. Nicaragua, Honduras and El Salvador have a coastline along the Gulf of Fonseca, a closed sea under international law, and have been involved in a lengthy dispute over the rights to the gulf and the islands located there. Each enjoys a littoral zone of sovereignty along its shores and islands in the gulf. In 1992 a chamber of the ICJ decided the Land, Island and Maritime Frontier Dispute, of which the gulf dispute was a part. El Salvador was awarded the islands of Meanguera and Meanguerita, and Honduras was awarded the island of El Tigre. Nicaragua was not a party to that dispute and is therefore not bound by the decision. The ICJ determined that Nicaragua, Honduras and El Salvador were to share control of the remaining water area in the gulf as a \\"tridominium\\" shared in common. The littoral zones abut each other in a way that forms two separate areas of tridominium waters in the gulf. The eastern area is bordered by the zones of all three countries. The larger western area (about 235 km2) is bordered only by the waters of El Salvador and Nicaragua and the closing line of the gulf, such that one cannot travel within the gulf from Honduras to the enclosed western area except by passing through El Salvadoran and Nicaraguan waters. All three nations are \\"entitled outside the closing line to territorial sea, continental shelf and exclusive economic zone. Whether this situation should remain in being or be replaced by a division and delimitation into three separate zones is, as inside the Gulf also, a matter for the three States to decide.\\"  Costa Rica  =Boundary dispute along the San Juan River= A sketch of the Greytown (i.e., San Juan del Norte) harbor area, contained in the first arbitral award given by Gen.

Image taken from Charlie Hale, \\"Regarding the Boundary Between Costa Rica and Nicaragua,\\" Google LatLong Blog, 5 Nov. 2010. According to the Ca√±as-Jerez Treaty of 1858, as reaffirmed and interpreted by the arbitration of U.S. president Grover Cleveland in 1888 and by the judgment of the Central American Court of Justice in 1916 , the border between Nicaragua and Costa Rica runs along the right bank of the San Juan River, from its mouth in the Caribbean port of San Juan del Norte (formerly known as Greytown), to a point located downstream from an old fortification known as Castillo Viejo (\\"Old Castle\\"), originally built to guard the access to Lake Nicaragua.Grover Cleveland, \\"Award of the President of the United States in Regard to the Validity of the Treaty of Limits Between Costa Rican and Nicaragua of 15 July 1858, Decision of 22 March 1888.\\" First published in John Basset Moore, History and Digest of the International Arbitrations to Which the United States has been a Party, vol. II (Washington, D.C.: Government Printing Office, 1898), p. 1946. Reproduced in the United Nations Reports of International Arbitral Awards, vol. XXVIII, pp. 189-236 (2006) Nicaragua is therefore sovereign over all of the R√≠o San Juan, but Costa Rica has the perpetual right to navigate with \\"purposes of commerce\\" over the part of the river where the right bank is the border between the two countries. Costa Rica also has the right to accompany shipments of merchandise with \\"revenue cutters\\" to help ensure the payment of tariffs (a stipulation which has been rendered obsolete by the free trade agreements among Central American countries), but president Cleveland's 1888 award denied Costa Rica the right to navigate the river with \\"vessels of war,\\" except with the consent of Nicaragua. The treaty of 1858 also states that no taxes would be imposed on Costa Rican trade in goods, except by mutual agreement. A dispute emerged in 1998 when Nicaragua forbade the transit of Costa Rican policemen in the river, which Nicaragua claimed to be a breach of sovereignty, and imposed a US$25 fee, as well as a visa requirement, for any Costa Rican tourists who entered the San Juan River, alleging that the Spanish language phrase con objetos de comercio, which had usually been translated (including in President Cleveland's awards) as \\"with purposes of commerce,\\" in fact had to be read as \\"with articles of commerce,\\" and that tourists were not \\"articles.\\"International Court of Justice, Case concerning the Dispute regarding Navigational and Related Rights (Costa Rica v. Nicaragua) Summary of the Judgment of 13 July 2009 . Costa Rica filed suit before the International Court of Justice (ICJ), in The Hague, which ruled in 2009 that con objetos de comercio had to be read as \\"with purposes of trade,\\" and that Nicaragua had therefore breached its treaty obligations by preventing free navigation with purposes of commercial tourism. The ICJ also ruled that Costa Rican police forces did not have the right to navigate the San Juan River with arms and ammunition, or to use the river to resupply their posts along the right bank. The ICJ also ruled that Nicaragua was obliged to recognize a customary right by Costa Rican inhabitants of the right bank of the river to practice subsistence fishing. Historically, the dispute over the San Juan River has been exacerbated by the possibility that it might become part of a Nicaragua Canal connecting the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. The opening of the Panama Canal in 1914, as well as Nicaragua's current construction of a dry ecocanal, have reduced the importance of the San Juan River as a possible route for interoceanic trade and have therefore, to some extent, eased the tensions between Nicaragua and Costa Rica over use of that waterway. Disputes between the two countries concerning the river and the associated frontier have nonetheless recurred in recent years. =2010 Isla Calero dispute= A map depicting the border lines in the area near San Juan del Norte, as disputed by Nicaragua and Costa Rica, Oct. 2010. In October 2010, a dispute began between Costa Rica and Nicaragua regarding the dredging of of the San Juan River by the Nicaraguan government in the area of Isla Calero. Costa Rica claims that violation of its sovereignty took place as Nicaraguan troops had entered Costa Rican territory, and the dredging of the river caused environmental damage in the wetlands at Isla Calero, which is part of the island nature reserve, in an area that is owned by the Costa Rican Ministry of the Environment. Nicaragua rejected all claims and replied that, in fact, Costa Ricans had been invading their territory. The Costa Rican government responded by sending 70 police reinforcements to the border area on October 22. Nicaragua stationed around 50 soldiers in Isla Calero Costa Rica claimed it was a military incursion and presented a complaint before the Organization of American States (OAS). On November 12, by a vote of 22 to 2, the OAS ambassadors approved a resolution requesting Costa Rica and Nicaragua to pull out their troops from a conflict zone along their common border and to hold talks to settle their dispute. Nicaragua's President Daniel Ortega discarded the possibility of withdrawing the troops and disregarded OAS resolution because his government considers that this organization does not have jurisdiction to resolve border disputes. On November 18, 2010, Costa Rica filed proceedings against Nicaragua in the ICJ. =1825 Guanacaste Province= In an 1825 plebiscite, the region of Partido de Nicoya chose to be part of Costa Rica, becoming Guanacaste Province. Costa Rica annexed Guanacaste, in exchange for giving up her claims to sovereignty over the San Juan River and the Canal Route. However, when tensions between the nations rose over Costa Rica's rights of navigation on the river in 2013, Nicaraguan president Daniel Ortega claimed Guanacaste province belonged to Nicaragua.

True to its name, the valley is situated on high elevations ranging from to , but it actually encompasses two distinct growing regions, the valley floor and the hillsides. The cool marine breezes are consistently sifting into the valley, keeping the valley cooler than the other appellations in Lake County. Red volcanic soils can be found on the hillsides while alluvial fans and benches on the valley floor provide well- drained beds for the vines. Red Bordeaux varietals and Syrah can be found planted along warmer ridges, while the cooler valley floor contains Pinot grigio, Pinot noir, Chardonnay, Riesling and Sauvignon blanc.  Geography  The valley itself is long and wide, with an east‚Äìwest orientation unusual in the Californian coastal range, a result of volcanic activity of Round Mountain, an extinct volcano lying within the valley. The AVA contains , and about are currently planted in vineyards. Most are relatively new, but within the area are some of the oldest vines in California. There are 15 struggling Zinfandel and Muscat vines planted by the Ogulin family, which brought them from Slovenia around 1875.

The first foreign scientist who described the blue-fronted lorikeet and the only one who managed to capture it (seven individuals in the 1920s, using lime) was the Java-born Dutch lepidopterist Lambertus Johannes Toxopeus, which is reflected in the Latin name of the bird. His observations were summarized by the Dutch ornithologist Hendrik Cornelis Siebers (1890‚Äì1949) in 1930. Toxopeus noted that the bird's habitat on Buru is likely restricted to the western part of the Rana plateau in the center of the island (settlements of Wa Temun, Wa Fehat and Nal Besi), as the local name of the bird, utu papua, was not known anywhere else on the island. Two indigenous hunters caught blue-fronted lorikeets for food north-west from the Rana lake, but the bird was not found in the mangroves of the Kayeli Bay at the eastern part of Buru.Noel F. R. Snyder Parrots: status survey and conservation action plan 2000‚Äì2004, IUCN (2000) p. 70 The locals living at the Rana plateau reported that the bird feeds on nectar and pollen of the flowering trees. Toxopeus found the bird at elevations of . Four blue-fronted lorikeets were observed in the 1980s, in very different areas at the north-western (Bara settlement) and southern coasts of Buru, at a coconut plantation and in a disturbed lowland forest between the coastal farming fields and the base of the nearby hills. Flocks of several birds were found in another area at elevation of . In November 2014, it was rediscovered and the first photographs were published by birders from BirdQuest in the internet. The analysis of all observations suggested that the blue-fronted lorikeet preferably inhabits forests at the altitude of several hundred meters.Blue-fronted Lorikeet , Hokkaido Institute of Environmental Sciences and Japan Science and Technology Agency The blue-fronted lorikeets usually live in pairs, but may form groups up to 10 individuals. They grow to about .Lor and lorikeet parrots The voice was described by Toxopeus as a ti‚Äìti‚Äìti‚Äìti‚Äìtititi shrill, but might be related not to the blue-fronted lorikeet, but to the red-flanked lorikeet (Charmosyna placentis) which was later observed in the same area. In nature the blue-fronted lorikeets feed on flowering trees of the family Myrtaceae, and in captivity they consumed bananas and milk. The anecdotal character of their observation and very limited habitat, which is gradually shrinking due to logging, urged the International Union for Conservation of Nature to gradually elevate its status from threatened in 1988 to vulnerable in 1994 and critically endangered since 2000. The establishment of two protected areas on Buru, Gunung Kapalat Mada (1,380 km¬≤) and Waeapo (50 km¬≤), partly aim at preserving the habitat of the blue-fronted lorikeet.

William J. conducted normal employment, but for one act: he quit a job as a Telluride, Colorado mine guard during a labor dispute without letting anyone know that he was doing so. As a result of subsequent conspiracies and false accusations, William J. Barney's disappearance came to national attention, and played a role not only in local intrigue, but also in maneuvering over the assassination trials of accused conspirators charged with the murder of former Idaho Governor Frank Steunenberg. History On May 1, 1901, 350 union miners walked off their jobs at the Smuggler-Union mine in Telluride. Their walkout was a protest of a new method of payment, called \\"contracting,\\" or \\"fathoms,\\" which could sometimes result in a miner doing thirty days worth of digging, and getting underpaid for the work. The strike was settled, but in some quarters animosity against union leaders continued. Bulkeley Wells, a Telluride mining company president and manager who, according to writer MaryJoy Martin, was \\"born to privilege... [and was] convinced laborers were beneath him,\\"The Corpse On Boomerang Road, Telluride's War On Labor 1899-1908, MaryJoy Martin, 2004, pages 231-232. was intent upon hanging Vincent St. John, the head of the local miners union. According to Martin, Wells colluded with others, including Pinkerton Agent James McParland, and the Colorado Mine Owners' Association, to accuse St. John of conducting a \\"reign of terror\\" -- and in particular, of murdering William J. Barney, a mine guard who had disappeared from his post. McParland, who decades earlier had been the special agent assigned to infiltrate the Molly Maguires in Pennsylvania, contributed his belief that an \\"Inner Circle\\" within the Western Federation of Miners was responsible for widespread assassinations.The Corpse On Boomerang Road, Telluride's War On Labor 1899-1908, MaryJoy Martin, 2004, page 102. Former McParland stenographer Morris Friedman wrote that McParland gained considerable income from Colorado's mining interests for the Pinkerton National Detective Agency by making such unproved accusations. At the time of his disappearance, the Telluride authorities didn't know any details of Will Barney's age, marital status, family, or where he came from. But they found some remains, and they drew conclusions. Wells placed a skull in a shop window, adorned with a sign decrying the \\"Grewsome Work\\" of the Telluride Miners' Union. There was one complicating factor: William Julius Barney wasn't dead.The Corpse On Boomerang Road, Telluride's War On Labor 1899-1908, MaryJoy Martin, 2004, pages 11-24 and 231-232.

E. Olds Transportation Museum The Oldsmobile Aerotech was a series of experimental high-speed vehicles manufactured between 1987 and 1992 incorporating the latest in performance technology with the intention of breaking multiple automobile speed records. The first such car was driven by four-time Indy 500 winner A. J. Foyt to a world closed-course speed record of 257.123 mph (413.788 km/h) on August 27, 1987 at the test track near Fort Stockton Texas. Prior to this, on August 26, 1987, the car had posted a top speed over a mile of 267.88 mph (431.10 km/h). Development At the end of 1984, the development of Oldsmobile Quad 4 engine was beginning. It was an inline-4 engine incorporating four valves per cylinder and dual overhead camshafts, an innovative technology used on a four- cylinder engine at the time. Oldsmobile advertised the engine to be highly fuel efficient and powerful. The engine generated a maximum power output of and in its standard configuration, outclassing the four-cylinder engines developed by German automobile manufacturers BMW and Mercedes, even rivalling Honda's 2.5-liter V6 engine. The engineers behind the development of the Quad 4 engine were adamant to showcase the engine's capabilities. Under the leadership of Ted Louckes, head of the Quad 4 engine program, they convinced top management at General Motors to develop a research vehicle which would showcase the engine's true potential. Shortly after in 1985, a group of engineers was formed under the leadership of Louckes in order to develop such a vehicle. The vehicle called the Aerotech was to use a sleek body made from carbon fibre in order to keep the weight and the coefficient of drag low in order to achieve maximum aerodynamics. Supporting the body panels would be a modified version March Engineering's 84C CART chassis, the same chassis that was used in the winning car of the 1985 Indianapolis 500. Powering the car would be a turbocharged version of the Quad 4 engine, now modified to generate in excess of . The task of designing the car was given to Ed Welburn, the then assistant chief designer at the Oldsmobile studio. The initial design sketches of the car were completed in early 1985. Inspired by famous LeMans winning race cars such as the Porsche 917, they quickly gained the approval from GM's top management. The first mockup of the car was completed shortly after the design's approval. Wind tunnel testing showed that the design was aerodynamically efficient but needed a few enhancements as pointed out by Max Schenkel, an aerodynamicist at General Motors who also served as a staff engineer on the Aerotech project. After many hours of wind tunnel testing at General Motors Technical Center at Warren, Michigan it was decided to alter the design by rounding off the shape of the nose and refine the canopy design. The air intakes were also moved from the sides of the car to the top of the rear fenders. Welburn had originally wanted the car to have faired-in wheel wells but an objection by Goodyear, the tire supplier for the project, prevented him from executing such a concept. The biggest aerodynamic innovation of the design was the car's underbody, incorporating adjustable panels that changed the amount of airflow that flew through the car's underbody tunnels. This system not only generated great amounts of downforce but also allowed the engineers to adjust the system best suitable for different race tracks. Welburn's original design incorporated a longer rear end, inspired by the Porsche 917 LH, which contradicted Louckes' plan for setting a closed-course record on the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. A long-tail version would hinder the car's handling despite providing a lower coefficient of drag. A short-tail version coupled with a pedestal rear spoiler was deemed more feasible. By the end of 1986, the construction of the first car was completed; the car was tested by A. J. Foyt at the General Motors proving grounds at Mesa, Arizona. Foyt, who was initially skeptical about the car's potential, admired the car's capabilities as he managed to take the car to speeds up to on the test track. Foyt is said to have admired the car for its stability at high speeds. As the car neared development, General Motors's senior management didn't gave the car approval for the record attempt at the General Motors Brickyard test track. The development team then chose to test the car at Ford Stockton test center located in Texas. After the successful runs at the General Motors proving grounds, the development team decided to put Welburn's long-tail design to test as well. Construction of a second car in this specification had begun in late 1985. The second car was almost the same as the first but featured elongated rear bodywork tapering downwards and a different engine, departing from the original 2.3-liter single turbocharged Quad 4 engine built by Batten to a twin turbocharged 2.3-litre Quad 4 engine, built in collaboration with Fueling Engineering. The new engine proved to be even more capable than its predecessor and generated a maximum power output in excess of . On August 26, 1987, the development team, in the presence of FIA officials, tested the two completed cars on the Ford Stockton test track. Initial tests with the short-tail version of the car resulted in an average speed of , falling close behind the closed-course speed record set by the Mercedes CIII-IV development prototype. As the team went on to adjust the car's aerodynamics, A. J. Foyt tested the second car (long-tail version). The long-tail version proved to be even more capable than its short-tail sibling and allowed Foyt to attain a top speed of at the flying mile after some practice runs. The next day, Foyt set a new speed record with the long-tail version, averaging after flying-mile runs in both directions of the track. The runs made with the now improved short-tail version, shortly after, resulted in a new closed-course speed record of , beating Mercedes' record by a big margin. Oldsmobile produced three versions of the original Aerotech to prove the capabilities of the company's Quad 4 engine. Two cars were built with shorter rear body work and were called Short Tail versions (ST), and one was built with a longer rear body work and thus called the Long Tail (LT). Subsequently, between December 7 and 15, 1992, another version of the Aerotech, this time powered by a 4.0-litre Oldsmobile Aurora V8 engine and now fitted with functional lights, broke 47 speed endurance records, including the 10,000- and 25,000-kilometre world speed records. Other national and international speed records ranging from 10 kilometres to 24 hours were accomplished by a team of drivers working 24 hours a day for 8 days. These records were also set at the Fort Stockton test track. In popular culture The speed records resulted in a great exposure of Oldsmobile and helped improve its sales. The cars made various appearances at autoshows across North America. A non-functional mock up with a makeshift interior also made its appearance at various circuit races. Ed Welburn, the designer of the car, was also given the opportunity to drive the Aurora Aerotech in December 2010. However, during that time, the car was limited to a mere to prevent any damages to the internal components.

The Garden of Earthly Delights is probably the most famous. * Gustave Dor√© made illustrations for Dante's The Divine Comedy, including Dante's visit to Hell. * Auguste Rodin made a sculpture, The Gates of Hell, based on Hell depicted in Dante's The Divine Comedy. Cartoons, comics and televised cartoon series * In the DC Universe, the character Lobo was banned from Hell, as he caused too many problems there, thus achieving immortality, as he was also banned from Heaven for much the same reason. Hell in the Sandman Series is run by a triumvirate of Lucifer Morningstar, Azazel, and Beelzebub. However demons like Belial and the Rhymer Etrigan scheme to get into the triumvirate. When the Fire of Hell is extinguished, an act of evil is required to reignite it. This is done by Eclipso slitting Enchantresse's throat. Hell is divided into Nine provinces. The Nine Provinces included Pandemonia, The Odium, The Gull, Praetori, Internecia, Ament, Labyrinth, Err, and Purgatory. Everything there is made from the damned. The rulers of Purgatory, Blaze and Satanus, lead a rebellion by offering hope to the hopeless, and finally Blaze betrays her brother and becomes Hell's ruler. * In the comic strip Dilbert (created by Scott Adams) \\"heck\\" is a lesser version of hell reserved for people who have done misdeeds that are not evil enough to warrant hell. Heck is ruled by Phil, the Prince of Insufficient Light who carries a giant spoon instead of a pitchfork. * In the one-panel comic The Far Side (created by Gary Larson in the 1980s) Hell is featured among other recurring themes, depicting Satan and his minions as grim-looking figures in robes with horns and pitchforks, running the place in a business-like manner: in one instance, the bespectacled secretary behind the typewriter asks her boss seen as a silhouette behind the office door: There is an insurance salesman here. Should I admit him in or tell to go to Heaven? * In the television series Futurama, the characters go to Robot Hell on occasion, where the Robot Devil and other evil robots reside. The entrance is located in New Jersey. * In the comic book series Ghost Rider, Johnny Blaze sold his soul to the demon Mephisto to cure his adoptive father from dying of cancer. In the recent revival of the series the Ghost Rider is seen residing in Hell to pay up his end of the bargain. Hell is depicted as a red desert with cannons and pools of lava. We see the devil as a powerful political leader residing in a grand palace with many servants and advisors. * In the comic book series Hellboy by award-winning artist Mike Mignola, Hell is a dark, alternate dimension filled with flames and demons and where the infernal capital city of Pandemonium resides. In issue one \\"Seed of Destruction\\" the Nazis with aid of the mad monk Rasputin successfully breach the boundary of Hell via magic and call forth the infant Hellboy so that he may bring about the end of the world. They are stopped, however, by the Allied Forces, who rescue Hellboy and raise him. * The comic book Spawn sees Hell and its demons as an important plot element. Mercenary Al Simmons gets betrayed by his own employers, dies, and goes to Hell. He then makes a deal with the devil Malebolgia (Guardian of Hell) that if he agrees to fight with Malebolgia's army, he would get to return to Earth and see his wife again. * Hell appears in many episodes of the television series South Park, especially in \\"Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?\\" and \\"Probably\\". * In the manga and anime series Yu-Gi-Oh!, there is a place where those who lose in so called \\"Shadow Duels\\" are forced to lose their souls and be banished to a realm of eternal night and torment, a realm simply called the \\"Shadow Realm\\". This is a pejorative replacement for the actual name of Hell, as English dubbers deemed it would be too inappropriate for the target audience they were aiming for. * The upcoming adult animated musical black comedy web series Hazbin Hotel is set in Hell. Hell is nominally ruled by Lucifer although residents seem to live in a de facto anarchist system, with no authority, allowing powerful demons and gangs to exert their own influence.

At the end of the film Justine Jones somehow finds herself trapped in her own private Hell. * Hell is subjective in the Hellraiser film series, as well as Clive Barker's novella. Upon solving the Lament Configuration, the sinner, or victim experiences a hell which they themselves defined by their own actions. * In the 1991 film Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey, the title characters go to Hell. * Hell is used as a plot subject in the Friday The 13th film Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday (1993). * In Event Horizon (1997), the ship's gravity drive opened a gateway to a hellish dimension outside the known universe. * In the film Deconstructing Harry (1997) by Woody Allen, the protagonist descends into Hell where he has a chance to learn from the Devil himself (played by Billy Crystal), among other things about the significance of having air conditioning in Hell, and then proceeds to discover his own father. * What Dreams May Come, a 1998 film that won an Academy Award for its depiction of heaven and hell as the subjective creations of the individual, was an essentially mystical interpretation of heaven, hell and reincarnation. Aided by his personal angel (Cuba Gooding, Jr.), an accidentally killed man (Robin Williams) leaves his personal Heaven home and searches the depths of many and varied Hells to find and rescue his wife, who is in her own damnation because the loss of her family drove her to suicide. It was based on the eponymous novel by Richard Matheson. * 2000's Little Nicky depicts Hell as a kingdom where monsters, giant fire birds, flying jellyfish and a large castle named the Castle of The Underworld belong.

Freddy Krueger who is impersonating Jason's mother, resurrects Jason from Hell and sends him to Springwood to cause panic and fear. * Constantine (a 2005 Warner Bros. film) depicts as graphic a version of the traditional Christian version of Hell as can be found in cinema: it shows a parallel plane with many of the same buildings and structures as the normal world, but twisted, ruined and perpetually seared as if eternally hit by the blast wave of a nuclear bomb. This film is based on the DC/Vertigo comic series Hellblazer. * The 2006 film Silent Hill depicts Hell numerous times throughout the film. Hell is depicted as a modern world, but decayed and rusted, populated by strange and horrific creatures. * The film Drag Me to Hell tells the story of a woman cursed by an evil gypsy. The curse will send her to Hell unless she can get rid of it. *Inferno directed by Ron Howard depicts Dante's Hell in popular culture, based on the novel by Dan Brown. Gaming =Roleplaying games= * In the Dungeons & Dragons role- playing game, there are seven hellish planes, usually called the Lower Planes. The Plane most often referred to as 'Hell' is the Outer Plane Baator and comprises nine levels, sometimes called the Nine Hells or the Nine Hells of Baator. The other planes are Pandemonium, an endless underground network filled with howling winds that cause madness; the Abyss, a collection of countless places of evil and chaos, each one worse than the one before; Carceri, the prison of the multiverse; Hades, place of grey and bleak plains; the four peaks of the vulcans of Gehenna; and Archeron, a place of broken weapons and engines of war from all battlefields. * In In Nomine, the forces of Heaven and Hell fight each other in a modern setting. Hell, the home location of all demons, is separated into several subdivisions called principalities, each ruled by one or more Demon Princes. All of Hell's principalities is named after a cultural version of hell (i.e., Hades, Sheol, Tartaurus, etc.) An additional area, known as lower hell, is where Lucifer resides. =Video games= * In Mortal Kombat, a version of Hell known as the Netherrealm exists, and is described as \\"the fiery depths of which are inhospitable to all but the most vile, a realm of demons and shadowy warriors\\" * The 1996 city-building god game Afterlife has the player build Heaven and Hell as cities. * In Bayonetta, Hell takes the form of a demonic realm called Inferno, a world inhabited by demons. * The fantasy horror video game Dante's Inferno, based on Dante's depiction of Hell in the Divine Comedy, is exclusively set in Hell, fully realised in its medieval Roman Catholic conception as a physical and supernatural environment full of grotesque suffering and torture in correspondence with various sins. * The video game series Devil May Cry features Hell as a location to battle through. The name of the main character Dante is a reference to The Divine Comedy, as is his twin brother Vergil. * In the first of the Diablo series of games, a portion of hell is featured as a pit deep under the ground largely characterized as a place of suffering, as the bodies of hundreds of apparently tortured people reside there. The game manual refers to this place as actually part of the mortal realm whose barriers with the metaphysical Hell have weakened, causing it to take on hellish attributes combined with more worldly ones. * In the second game of the above series, Diablo II, the player character ventures into Hell in Act IV to finish off the game by killing the titular antagonist again, in his own separate domain of the realm, the Chaos Sanctuary. * The famous Doom series also involves the concept of Hell, but with a science-fiction twist, as a future teleportation experiment accidentally opens a gate to Hell, releasing demons. Hell is treated in the Christian conception, replete with Satanic symbols and corporeal demons, as a parallel universe of crimson skies, black mountains and oceans of fire. At the end of the second game in the series Hell is wrecked, and the main character wonders where evil people will go when they die. In Doom 3 the player must travel to Hell to obtain a powerful Martian artifact. * The first Fear Effect game deals extensively with the Chinese concept of hell, replete with its aforementioned political ramifications. Several of the later levels actually take place in the Chinese hell. * In Hellgate: London, demonic armies have emerged from hell to reduce London to ruin and are slowly converting the world through a process called \\"Hellforming\\". The protagonist must fight back the demonic invaders. * Hell is portrayed as a battlefield frozen in time in the video game Painkiller. Everything from bullets to trenches to mushroom clouds are present in stark stasis, allowing the player to move about the vista to get a good look. The level culminates with a showdown with Satan himself. * In the game Tony Hawk's Underground 2, there is an unlockable level (within 2 others) that depicts Hell. Little Demons, rural citizens, and a jazz dancing Satan are in the level. * In Minecraft, players are able to create a portal to \\"The Nether\\", which is inspired by the classic \\"fire-and-brimstone\\" depiction of Hell. * In the Heroes of Might and Magic series, Sheogh, the equivalent of Hell, is the home of the Inferno faction, a dark kingdom of demons. * In the game Dwarf Fortress, Hell is blocked off from the overworld by semi-molted rock and the mythical Adamantine. Opening a pathway between the two unleashes a virtually endless amount of demons, effectively ending the game. * In Super Meat Boy, Hell is the fourth chapter of the game. It is depicted as a dark reddish environment with much lava. * In Saints Row: Gat out of Hell, The whole game takes place in a city set in hell. * Skullgirls has a stage called Gehenna, which is made entirely of flesh, teeth, eyes, and a lake of blood. It is said to be the domain of the shapeshifter Double. Literature See also Hell (Literature) * Dante Alighieri's famous epic poem Divine Comedy tells how he visits Heaven and Hell. His visit to Hell is probably the most famous literary depiction of the concept. Hell has its entrance in the Northern hemisphere, the other side of the world to Purgatory, and the bottom of Hell is at the Centre of the Earth. Hell is systematically divided in thematical tortures for crimes of the same nature in its Nine Circles, for example people who were violent against others are trapped in the Seventh Circle of Hell in a boiling river of blood with centaurs firing arrows to keep them in their place. The people are judged by the serpentine Minos. Hell was created by Lucifer's fall; he is now trapped in the final level for Traitors. Hell is surrounded by the river Acheron, the neutral sit on the banks chased by swarms of insects and running after a banner. Dante claims to have seen several famous people being tortured in hell: biblical characters (Judas, Cain, ...), mythological characters (Medusa, the Minotaur,...), historical characters (Nero, Brutus, Attila the Hun,...) and people of his own lifetime. His journey is described with many imaginative details. * In Milton's Paradise Lost, Lucifer and the other fallen angels (such as Beelzebub, Belial, and Molech) are imprisoned in Hell for rebelling against God after the birth of Christ. Hell is Nine days' fall from Heaven and three times further than Earth. Between it and the Universe are Chaos and Night. In Hell, the fallen angels build Pandemonium. Hell's gate is guarded by Sin, Satan's daughter. In Book 10 a bridge is built from Hell to Earth by Sin and Death after the Fall of Man, which has been caused by Lucifer, while the fallen angels are turned into snakes. * Christian theologian, scientist, philosopher and mystic Emanuel Swedenborg wrote Heaven and Hell in which he claimed to have visited Hell. Popular culture * In Piers Anthony's series Incarnations of Immortality, Hell, along with Heaven and Purgatory, are actual locations populated by the main characters and souls of the dead. * Wayne Barlowe's book, God's Demon, is set in Hell and follows the endeavors of a powerful Demon, Sargatanas, to achieve redemption. The hell depicted is in many ways the classical Christian perception of burning cities and desolate wastelands with souls being routinely tortured. * In the novel City Infernal by Edward Lee, as well as its sequels Infernal Angel and House Infernal, Hell is depicted as a modern metropolis (the Mephistopolis), albeit where electricity is provided by tapping the bio-electricity of tortured souls, chaos and suffering is systematically enforced, organic materials (bones, blood, et al.) are used for everything from food and building materials and everything in-between, and vicious horrors, both born and manufactured, run rampant, all of which serves as an affront to God. It's also said to exist in a version of Earth in a separate plane of existence, and that its dimensions are based on those of Heaven. Music =Albums= * GWAR uses the word \\"hell\\" and related concepts in the albums titled Beyond Hell (2006) and Hell-O! (1988). * Slayer's second studio album is titled Hell Awaits. Many of the band's other songs also have Hellish lyrical themes. * The 2004 Insane Clown Posse album, Hell's Pit is a concept album about Hell. * Bring Me the Horizon's third studio album, There Is a Hell Believe Me I've Seen It. There Is a Heaven Let's Keep It a Secret revolves around the themes of Heaven and Hell. * The Venom album titled Welcome to Hell was released in 1981. * Gary Numan's (Musical Artist) released the album 'Exile' in 1997 of which has very strong anti-Christian views on God and the acts of which God seems to 'permit' to happen on earth. Also contains lyrics claiming Numan's personal dismissal of co-operating with God i.e. from the song 'The Angel Wars' - \\"I won't pray here or bow my head. I won't praise your name, I won't kneel down...\\" His newer albums, 'Pure' (2000) and 'Jagged' (2006) also put across songs with similar 'bases' but are not directly aimed at religion (specifically Christianity) and do not contain lyrics of personal 'conversations' with God or a similar nature. Radio * Bleak Expectations BBC Radio 4 series spoofs Dante's Inferno in the 2nd episode of the fourth series. The underworld is a place for all souls before they are assigned to their respective heavens or hells. * The BBC Radio 4 comedy series Old Harry's Game is set in Hell. It was written by Andy Hamilton, who also stars as Satan. Television * In the Buffyverse, there are several places in the world that are natural gateways between the underworld and the world of mortals. One of these Hellmouths is located directly under the library of the Sunnydale High School. However, instead of there being one hell, there are hundreds of hell dimensions, in which demons are the dominant lifeform and non-demonic life is subject to great torture. Precise details of Hell are unrevealed, but Angel was sent to a Hell dimension for around four months on Earth and is said to have experienced five hundred years of torment in that time, leaving him temporarily regressed to a feral mentality before he begins to recover. When Buffy returns from death in Season 6, her friends believer her shocked and unengaging behavior is due to her being in a Hell dimension. * In Doctor Who, the Tenth Doctor comes across a being which identifies itself as 'the Beast', resembles popular interpretations of the Devil, and makes numerous references to Hell. In a later episode, \\"Hell\\" is said to be a synonym for The Void between dimensions, the coordinates of which are all sixes. The Void is nothingness, the place between Universes. * In the science fiction series Lexx, Heaven and Hell are depicted as two joined planets situated in the darkest part of the Dark Zone. The hell planet is known as Planet Fire to its inhabitants. When a human who has made bad choices dies in the Lexx universe, their life essence is taken to the Core of Fire. They are eternally reincarnated to suffer on the planet's surface. Hell is depicted as an endless burning desert, with distant towers dedicated to various types of punishment. The inhabitants have no memories of their resurrections or past lives, and exist in an ongoing cycle of suffering and death. * The television series Supernatural mentions Hell many times as the place that demons originated- demons in this world being human souls broken by their torture in Hell- and shows the place in a couple of episodes. Protagonist Dean Winchester was sent to Hell after a demon deal where he experienced forty years of torture in four months, and his brother Sam was trapped in a deeper part of Hell under the personal attention of Lucifer for over a year on Earth before his soul was rescued by Death; their father-figure, Bobby Singer, experienced his own Hell where he was tormented by demonic versions of Sam and Dean until he was rescued by the real Sam. * The television series Reaper has the main character Sam as a bounty hunter for the devil who must send escaped souls back to hell. Entrances to hell are places that are considered hell on Earth, such as the Department of Motor Vehicles and a storage center where multiple murder victims are hidden. * Hell appears in some episodes of The Twilight Zone, most notability in \\"A Nice Place to Visit\\" and \\"The Hunt\\". * In the American television supernatural drama Ghost Whisperer, \\"Hell\\" is depicted as the place where ghosts go if they do not cross over into the light and instead go to the Dark Side. * In the British science fiction sitcom Red Dwarf several characters make reference to \\"Silicon Hell\\", the presumed alternative to the concept of \\"Silicon Heaven\\" programmed into most artificially intelligent devices in order to preserve their loyalty to humanity. * Hell appears in the superhero television series Legends of Tomorrow, portrayed as a slum. It is ruled by a triumvirate made up of Belial, Beelzebub and Satan. * Hell also appears in Good Omens. * Hell appears in Part 3 of Chilling Adventures of Sabrina * Hell is one of the main settings for The Good Place, referred to as 'The Bad Place' but still inhabited by demons whose job is to torture humans who failed to get enough 'good person' points on Earth to reach the Good Place.

In some women it occurs only with the first let-down in a feeding, occasionally women may have multiple strong letdowns during a feeding. OALD can make breastfeeding difficult and can be the source of some breastfeeding complications. It may also be known as hyper milk-ejection. A woman may have OALD in addition to an oversupply of breastmilk. (Often called foremilk-hindmilk imbalance, hyperlactation syndrome, oversupply colic syndrome, and other near synonyms.) The physical or medical cause of an overactive let-down is still unknown. Whether mothers with OALD have a higher overall milk volume ‚Äì or a strong reaction to the hormone oxytocin (which causes the let-down reflex) also remains to be seen. Complications The forceful spray of milk can cause the baby to consume too much milk too quickly as well as to swallow air during the period of rapid swallowing following the let-down. The speed of the flow of milk into the mouth can cause the baby to react with reduced nursing times and aversion to nursing often described by mothers as \\"fussiness\\", \\"colicky\\", \\"dislikes nursing\\", or \\"is weaning\\". Some babies, especially those of approximately 2‚Äì4 months of age, become increasingly upset with the spray of milk which may increase their aversion to nursing to the point of refusing the breast (a nursing strike). Overactive let-down can be a part of a constellation of symptoms that make up oversupply syndrome or oversupply colic. Babies coping with OSS, gain weight quickly in the early months, even while nursing for short period. Some OSS babies sleep for surprisingly long periods of time and depth, possibly due to an over-full feeling, while others have very disturbed sleep, possibly due to gastrointestinal pain. Treatment There are effective remedies for overactive let-down, and oversupply syndrome, however aggressive treatment should be watched carefully by someone familiar with the condition as the mother is at a higher risk for plugged ducts, mastitis and other breast infections. Overactive let-down can take a long time to control and can be frustrating for the mother and baby, but when controlled effectively a long and satisfying breastfeeding relationship is possible. Mothers with this condition are often given various incorrect rationales for their concerns such as \\"having weak milk\\", or \\"bad milk\\", it's \\"just colic\\", the baby will \\"grow out of it\\", or the child is \\"allergic to your milk\\", or a food in the mother's diet. There are no valid reasons to stop breastfeeding due to this condition. A strong letdown reflex often coincides with overactive milk production, engorgement, and problems with the sucking/breathing pattern of the baby. Remedies for Engorgement include: * Gentle breast massage from the chest wall toward the nipple area before nursing. * Cool compresses for up to 20 minutes before nursing. * Moist warmth for a few minutes before nursing may help the milk begin to flow. Avoid using warmth for more than a few minutes as the warmth can increase swelling and inflammation. * When preparing to nurse, mothers should allow the initial letdown reflex to occur and then subside before beginning the nursing session. Or they may stop the nursing momentarily until that strong letdown reflex passes. This will allow the milk flow to normalize. For very young infants, it may help to hand express the initial milk flow. It can extend the nursing session which is preferable for young infants. Remedies for OALD include: * When nursing, listen carefully to the breathing and sucking pattern of the baby. If the pattern is interrupted and it sounds as if the baby is struggling to swallow, gently slip a finger in the baby's mouth and remove the nipple until the baby is able to swallow and breathe. Also, have a hand towel near during nursing. It can be easily tucked into the bra to absorb the overflow of milk when waiting for that letdown reflex to subside. * Nurse early and often ‚Äì at least 10 times per 24 hours. Don't skip feedings (even at night). * Nurse on baby's cues (\\"on demand\\"). If baby is very sleepy: wake baby to nurse every 2‚Äì3 hours, allowing one longer stretch of 4‚Äì5 hours at night. * Allow baby to finish the first breast before offering the other side. Switch sides only once baby pulls off or falls asleep. Don't limit baby's time at the breast. Pumping off milk should be done only with the guidance of an experienced breastfeeding counselor, as part of a unilateral ad lib protocol.

It is most famous for Sapperton canal tunnel and its connection with the Cotswold Arts and Crafts Movement in the early 20th century. It had a population of 424,Office for National Statistics : Census 2001 : Parish Headcounts : Cotswold Retrieved 21 January 2010 which had reduced to 412 at the 2011 census. The parish includes the villages of Sapperton and Frampton Mansell. The outlying hamlet of Daneway lies in the parish of Bisley, but is nearer to the village of Sapperton and often considered a part of it. History and architecture The Domesday Book of 1086 lists the village as Sapleton. There are many interesting buildings in Sapperton associated with the leading designers of the Arts and Crafts movement in the area, as well as the church, primary school, and a pub. Sir Robert Atkyns, the county historian and author of The Ancient and Present State of Gloucestershire (1712), lived in the manor house of the village, now demolished, in the early 18th century. The manor was later acquired by the Bathurst family, who still own most of the village and land. Most of the buildings in the eastern part of the village were built (or rebuilt) under the patronage of the Bathurst family in the Cotswold Arts and Crafts style. Upper Dorvel House and Beechanger, designed and built by the brothers Ernest (died 1925) and Sidney Barnsley (died 1926), and the Leasowes, built by their colleague Ernest Gimson (d. 1919) are to the north-east of the Church. Norman Jewson (1884-1975), friend and associate of Gimson, and son-in-law to Ernest Barnsley, lived at Bachelors' Court. His memoir, By Chance I did Rove (1952; twice reprinted) of village life and his association with the Gimson circle at the turn of the twentieth century is recognised as a minor classic of Cotswold literature. St Kenelm is the parish church. It was last rebuilt during Queen Anne's reign.

A rupture disk is a type of sacrificial part because it has a one-time-use membrane that fails at a predetermined differential pressure, either positive or vacuum. The membrane is usually made out of metal,US Patent 2,630,939 but nearly any material (or different materials in layers) can be used to suit a particular application. Rupture disks provide instant response (within milliseconds or microseconds in very small sizes) to an increase or decrease in system pressure, but once the disk has ruptured it will not reseal. Major advantages of the application of rupture disks compared to using pressure relief valves include leak-tightness, cost, response time, size constraints, and ease of maintenance. Rupture disks are commonly used in petrochemical, aerospace, aviation, defense, medical, railroad, nuclear, chemical, pharmaceutical, food processing and oil field applications. They can be used as single protection devices or as a secondary relief device for a conventional safety valve; if the pressure increases and the safety valve fails to operate or can't relieve enough pressure fast enough, the rupture disk will burst. Rupture disks are very often used in combination with safety relief valves, isolating the valves from the process, thereby saving on valve maintenance and creating a leak- tight pressure relief solution. It is sometimes possible and preferable for highest reliability, though at higher initial cost, to avoid the use of emergency pressure relief devices by developing an intrinsically safe mechanical design that provides containment in all cases. Although commonly manufactured in disk form, the devices also are manufactured as rectangular panels (rupture panels, vent panels or explosion panels) and used to protect buildings, enclosed conveyor systems or any very large space from overpressurization typically due to an explosion. Rupture disk sizes range from to over , depending upon the industry application. Rupture disks and vent panels are constructed from carbon steel, stainless steel, hastelloy, graphite, and other materials, as required by the specific use environment. Rupture disks are widely accepted throughout industry and specified in most global pressure equipment design codes (ASME, PED, etc.). Rupture disks can be used to specifically protect installations against unacceptably high pressures or can be designed to act as one-time valves or triggering devices to initiate with high reliability and speed a sequence of actions required. Two disk technologies There are two rupture disk technologies used in all rupture disks, both of which can be paired with a bursting disc indicator so as to be alerted if they fail: forward-acting (tension loaded) and reverse buckling (compression). In the traditional forward-acting design, the loads are applied to the concave side of the rupture disk, stretching the dome until the tensile forces exceed the ultimate tensile stress of the material and the disk bursts. Flat rupture disk do not have a dome but, when pressure is applied, are still subject to tension loaded forces and are thus also forward-acting disks. The thickness of the raw material employed and the diameter of the disk determines the burst pressure. Most forward-acting discs are installed in systems with a 80% or lower operating ratio. In later iterations on forward-acting disk designs, precision-cut or laser scores in the material during manufacturing were used to precisely weaken the material allowing for more variables to control of the burst pressure. This approach to rupture disks, while effective, does have limitations. Forward-acting disks are prone to metal fatigue caused by pressure cycling and operating conditions that can spike past recommended limits for the disk, causing the disk to burst at lower than its marked burst pressure. Low burst pressures also pose a problem for this disk technology. As the burst pressure lowers, the material thickness decreases. This can lead to extremely thin disks (similar to tin foil) that are highly prone to damage and have a higher chance of forming pinhole leaks due to corrosion. These disks are still successfully used today and are preferred in some situations. Reverse buckling rupture disks are the inversion of the forward-acting disk. The dome is inverted and the pressure is now loaded on the convex side of the disk. Once the reversal threshold is met, the dome will collapse and snap through to create a dome in the opposite direction. While that is happening, the disk is opened by knife blades or points of metal located along the score line on the downstream side of the disk. By loading the reverse buckling disk in compression, it is able to resist pressure cycling or pulsating conditions. The material thickness of a reverse buckling disk is significantly higher than that of a forward-acting disk of the same size and burst pressure. The result is greater longevity, accuracy and reliability over time. Correct installation of reverse buckling disks is essential. If installed upside down, the device will act as a forward acting disk and, due to the greater material thickness, will burst at much higher than the marked burst pressure. Blowout panel Blowout panels, also called blow-off panels, areas with intentionally weakened structure, are used in enclosures, buildings or vehicles where a sudden overpressure may occur. By failing in a predictable manner, they channel the overpressure or pressure wave in the direction where it causes controlled, directed minimal harm, instead of causing a catastrophic failure of the structure. Blow-off panels are used in ammunition compartments of some tanks to protect the crew in case of ammunition explosion, turning a catastrophic kill into a lesser firepower kill. An alternative example is a deliberately weakened wall in a room used to store compressed gas cylinders; in the event of a fire or other accident, the tremendous energy stored in the (possibly flammable) compressed gas is directed into a \\"safe\\" direction, rather than potentially collapsing the structure in a similar manner to a thermobaric weapon. =Military applications= Blowout panels are installed in several modern tanks, including the M1 Abrams, and have in the past been considered as a possible solution to magazine explosions on battleships. In military ammunition storage, blowout panels are included in the design of the bunkers which house explosives. Such bunkers are designed, typically, with concrete walls on four sides, and a roof made of a lighter material covered with earth. In some cases this lighter material is wood, though metal sheeting is also employed. The design is such that if an explosion or fire in the ammunition bunker (also called a locker) were to occur, the force of the blast would be directed vertically, and away from other structures and personnel. Applications in biology Some models of gene gun also use a rupture disc, but not as a safety device. Instead, their function is part of the normal operation of the device, allowing for precise pressure-based control of particle application to a sample. In these devices, the rupture disc is designed to fail within an optimal range of gas pressure that has been empirically associated with successful particle integration into tissue or cell culture. Different disc strengths can be available for some gene gun models. References External links * Rupture disc sizing calculator to calculate discharge area requirement of a simple system.

Football  Football is the most popular sport in Peru, and the Peru national football team have competed in the FIFA World Cup five times. * 1930 * 1970 (Quarterfinals) * 1978 (Quarterfinals) * 1982 * 2018 The national team has also won two Copa Am√©rica trophies: 1939 and 1975. Taekwondo Taekwondo was introduced in Peru by Hakeem Aanders Polar, an Arequipe√±os instructor master the art of Taekwondo in Cochabamba, Bolivia, and introduced this form of martial art in the early 1970s. The first Taekwondo Clubs in Peru were to be found in Arequipa. In the late 1970s, Sa Bum Nim Byon Oh Park introduced taekwondo in Lima. In 1979, Sa Bum Nim Jon Hye, after a few years spent in Argentina also joined Byon Oh Park in disseminating taekwondo in Lima. Simultaneously to these two, John Polar and Byon Oh Park, Alex Velazques was doing taekwondo with a reduced number of practices along with \\"La Yegua\\" Leiblinger who later moved to Argentina. It was Byon Oh Park, who introduced the regulated form of taekwondo and started to teach to some new taekwondo instructors. Of those, Percy Vergara and Juan Infantas were the YUHmain instructors and the ones who started the dissemination of taekwondo to bigger audiences. Both Percy Vergara and Juan Infantas started to run a Taekwondo Club in the San Marcos University. They also opened up a new club, Black Belt Taekwondo Club where most of their best students from San Marcos continued training. In 1982, the first open martial arts competition was run. In this competition, practitioners from kung fu, karate, kyokushinkai and other styles, along with taekwondo took part. It was the first time taekwondo athletes were to take part in any open national event. After this experience taekwondo grew up in popularity and a number of clubs and academies started to flourish. In 1981, Saboming Ki Hyung Lee arrived to Peru and joined forces into making this sport even more popular. Percy Vergara started clubs in Regattas Lima, as Cesar Landeo started one in the Engineering National University (UNI) where he graduated as Electrical engineer. The UNI team has won more than 10 university championships between 1981 and 1994 at the university level. Other taekwondo Clubs appeared and flourished, thanks also to the contribution of Ki Bong Lee, So Yong Kim and Eui Wan Chong. In the south of Peru, taekwondo was disseminated by Professor Alberto Cabrera Cano, Angle Leon, while in the north by Professor Luis Benites. Today taekwondo, although it has lost the prestige it had by the mid-1990s remains steadfast and efforts are made to return the sport in Peru to its previous level of prestige. The Peru 2008 Summer Olympics team included Peter L√≥pez; he finished at fourth place. Basketball Until the mid-70s, Peru had one of the best basketball national teams in South America. However, since the 1973 South American Basketball Championship, where Peru won the bronze medal, international victories have become scarce. Rugby league While no Rugby league has been played on Peru soil, Peru has a National Rugby league team. They make their debut on 17 October 2015 in the first Latino Seven's competition. Rugby union On 30 November 1996, the first university test match saw the Universidad de Lima win 18 to 3 against the Pontificia Universidad Catolica. This match also has the distinction of being the first time that the participants on the pitch including team members and the referee were Peru-born. Volleyball The Peru women's national volleyball team is the national team of Peru. The team was one of the dominant forces in women's volleyball in the 1980s, culminating in the silver medal won at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea. Surfing For travelers from all over the world, Peru offers waves for everyone: beginners, intermediate Felipe Pomar, Second World Surfing Championship, Peru 1965, and Sofia Mulanovich, Women's World Surf Champion in 2004 and The national team has also won two Copa Am√©rica trophies: 1939 and 1975. Sailing Peru is the only country of the region that has won the Central, South American & Caribbean Championships for six years in Sunfish Class. In the Optimist Class, it was three times World Champion in Team-Racing in 1997 and 1998, and have more South American Champions in J24, Windsurf, Laser Class and Lightning. Shooting Peru's four Olympic medals achievements include three in shooting. Edwin V√°squez won Peru's only gold medal in the 1948 Summer Olympics, while Francisco Boza (Los Angeles 1984), and Juan Giha (Barcelona 1992) both won silver medals. Tennis Luis Horna and Jaime Yzaga are well-known Peru-born tennis players. Tennis Hall of Famer and Davis Cup and Wimbledon winner Alejandro Olmedo is Peru-born, but played for the United States. Laura Arraya is the best Peruvian tennis player in the women's competition. Her brother is Pablo Arraya, a former Peruvian tennis player. The Peru Davis Cup team currently compete in the Americas Zone Group II, with their best result qualifying for the World Group in 2008. They had twice previously reached the World Group playoffs in 1989 and 1994, but did not advance. Club Lawn Tennis de la Exposici√≥n is located in the district of Jes√∫s Mar√≠a in Lima, the usual court location for Peru's players. The court was found in 1884, and was the home court for the golden generation of Peru's tennis players of the 1980s. Its principal colosseum was named after the Buse Brothers, Enrique and Eduardo Buse. Enrique played at Wimbledon and the US Open in 1946 and again at the US Open in 1951. Peru at the Olympics Peru has officially participated in 17 Summer Olympic Games and 2 Winter Olympic Games. The Comit√© Ol√≠mpico Peruano is the National Olympic Committee for Peru which was founded in 1924 and recognized by the International Olympic Committee in 1936. Peru has won a total of four medals, three in shooting events and one in volleyball. Their first and only gold medal to date was won by Edwin V√°squez in the 1948 Summer Olympics in the Men's 50 metre pistol. The remaining three medals were silver.

The hospital is the flagship medical center for Eskenazi Health, founded in 1859 as Indiana's oldest public healthcare system. The hospital is operated by Health & Hospital Corporation of Marion County. The current hospital opened December 7, 2013, less than to the west of the original campus, replacing Wishard Memorial Hospital. Many of Eskenazi Hospital's 4,620 medical staff is provided by a mix of faculty, residents, and students of the adjacent Indiana University School of Medicine. History An infant operating table in Wishard Hospital, c. 1916 The hospital was founded as Indianapolis City Hospital in 1859 in response to a smallpox epidemic in the city. During the Civil War, the hospital was used by the Union Army to treat some 13,000 sick and wounded soldiers. The hospital reverted to community control after the war. In 1943, the hospital became the first in the U.S. to coordinate ambulance dispatch via two-way radios. In the 20th century, the main facility was located at 1001 West 10th Street and went through several name changes, including: Indianapolis General Hospital (1947); Marion County General Hospital (1959); and Wishard Memorial Hospital (1975). The Wishard name was selected to honor Dr. William N. Wishard, a leading physician in Indianapolis. The main hospital campus included the Myers Building (Intensive Care, Labor and Delivery, OB/GYN, Surgery, and General Medicine Wards) as well as other buildings housing the Level I trauma center, Level I Burn Unit, Psychiatric Care, Prisoner Care, Outpatient Surgery, Therapy, Long Term Care, and various clinics. Wishard Memorial became Indiana's first certified Level I trauma center in 1992. Due to the aging of the physical plant and its inefficiencies, plans were made to construct an entirely new hospital. On November 3, 2009, 85 percent of Marion County voters approved a major bond referendum for the development of a new public medical center. On June 22, 2011, Wishard Health Services announced that the new hospital would be named in honor of Indianapolis real estate developers and philanthropists Sidney and Lois Eskenazi, who had donated $40 million for the new hospital. Building Construction for the $754 million Sidney & Lois Eskenazi Hospital started in 2010 and opened to the public on December 7, 2013. Situated on on the Indiana University ‚Äì Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) campus, the complex covers over 11 floors above ground and is in height. A connected 2,700-space parking garage is also located on the campus. HOK was the project's lead architect, while Jacobs Engineering Group was project manager. Eskenazi Hospital contains 315 inpatient beds, 200 examination rooms, 17 operating rooms, 12 labor and delivery rooms, Central Indiana's only adult burn center, and one of only three Adult Level I trauma centers in the state. =Sustainability and wellness= Eskenazi Hospital was certified as a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Gold building in 2015. The LEED Gold designation was notable for being Indiana's first. Eskenazi Hospital's front entrance is flanked by a plaza, called The Commonground, which features 5,000 perennial plants, a trellis sculpture, lawns, public seating, Healing Waters dry-deck fountain, the St. Margaret's Hospital Guild Limestone Falls, and the Frank & Katrina Basile Pavilion. The Basile Pavilion is home to Duos, an Indianapolis- based restaurant serving local food. The Commonground was designed by Philadelphia-based landscape architecture and urban design firm David Rubin Land Collective, with The Olin Studio and Diller Scofidio + Renfro. The plaza opened to the public in July 2014. Eskenazi Hospital has been recognized for its emphasis on growing and serving local and healthy food options. In 2016, the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine ranked Eskenazi sixth of 24 hospitals recognized nationwide for providing fresh vegetables, whole grains, cholesterol-free entrees, and soy milk. The hospital produces about two tons of produce annually from its rooftop gardens, called the Sky Farm. Of the $3.4 million annual food budget, the hospital manages to allocate 40 percent to Indiana farm and food suppliers, serving about 113,000 meals monthly. Art collection Hoosier Group painter T. C.

Williams began his career as a minor league baseball player, and later joined the front office of his team. In the late 1960s he moved into basketball, with his biggest achievements being the 1983 title of the Philadelphia 76ers and being a partner in the creation of the Orlando Magic. Early life Williams was born in 1940 in Philadelphia, the second oldest of four children and the only son. He was raised in Wilmington, Delaware, attending Tower Hill School where his father coached and taught. He became a friend of Ruly Carpenter, son of Philadelphia Phillies owner Bob \\"R.R.M.\\" Carpenter, who would bring Williams to the Phillies‚Äô dugout and clubhouse, as well as to the team's spring training in Clearwater, Florida. His interest in baseball would earn Williams a scholarship to Wake Forest University. There Williams earned a bachelor's degree in physical education in 1962 while being a catcher on the Demon Deacons baseball team. Williams would later earn a master's of science degree in physical education from Indiana University in 1964. Additionally, Pat served for seven years in the United States Army and later got a doctorate in Humane Letters from Flagler College. Former Chicago White Sox owner Bill Veeck is credited by Williams as his mentor, with a visit to Veeck in 1962 starting their friendship and giving Williams principles followed in his career, such as \\"Don‚Äôt announce promotions in advance, be out on the speaking circuit, stand at the gates when fans leave, open your own mail and don‚Äôt screen your calls\\".http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Journal/Issues/2013/02/11/Champions/Pat- Williams.aspx?hl=Sports%20Business%20Awards‚âª=0 Baseball career Williams' baseball career began when the Carpenters signed him in 1962 to the Fort Myers Mighty Mussels, their minor league team in the Florida State League. He was a catcher for two years then retired and moved in to a front office role. Marlins general manager Bill Durney still saw in Williams an eager and natural leader with a marketing degree, and invited him to be the team's business manager. One year later, the Phillies appointed him to be the general manager of the Spartanburg Phillies. As the Phillies became a powerhouse of the Western Carolinas League, Williams was later elevated to the position of president of the organization in 1967, and was chosen the Minor League Executive of the Year by The Sporting News. Afterwards he spent three years in the Minnesota Twins organization. Even after moving to basketball, Williams is still active in baseball -- every winter, he plays in Major League Fantasy Camps. He was also president of Orlando's Double-A Southern League team from 1990 to 1993. Basketball management Williams moved into basketball in 1968, becoming the Philadelphia 76ers business manager. With promotions that included elaborate halftime shows and a successful 55-27 performance, the 76ers were third in attendance of the 1968‚Äì69 NBA season. Afterwards the faltering Chicago Bulls hired Williams to become their general manager. Williams immediately revamped the team's roster, trading with the Sixers for Chet Walker, and invested on the promotion, including the creation of mascot Benny the Bull. The Bulls had become a force in the league as the Atlanta Hawks brought Williams to be their GM in 1973. He spent just one year in Atlanta, where his most notable action was trading star Pete Maravich for two players and five draft picks. As the Sixers had become one of the worst teams in the NBA, owner Irv Kosloff invited Williams to return in 1974. Williams then remained in Philadelphia for 12 years as their general manager, helping to build the team that won the 1982‚Äì83 NBA season, by trading for Julius Erving and Moses Malone, and drafting Maurice Cheeks and Andrew Toney. Frustrated at his failure to build a 76ers dynasty despite bringing new talent such as Charles Barkley, Williams left the organization in 1986. As the year before Orlando executive Jim Hewitt told Williams of his idea of bringing an NBA team to his city, he decided to join Hewitt's investment group. Williams invested in convincing NBA commissioner David Stern and the league owners of the viability of the small-town Florida city in supporting an NBA franchise. The league awarded the Orlando Magic an expansion spot in 1987, with the team making its debut in 1989. Serving as the franchise's inaugural manager, Williams helped the Magic reach the 1995 NBA Finals by drafting Shaquille O'Neal and trading a draft pick for Penny Hardaway. The following year, he was promoted to senior vice president of Magic parent company RDV Sports, Inc..http://www.nba.com/magic/news/Magic_to_Honor_Pat_Williams-216535-800.html In his NBA career, Williams led his teams to 23 NBA Playoffs and five NBA Finals. He won four NBA draft lotteries, including back-to-back winners in 1992 and 1993 and most recently in 2004. Williams signed Billy Cunningham, Chuck Daly, and Matt Guokas to their first professional coaching contracts. Nineteen of his former players have become NBA head coaches. In April 2019, after a career that has spanned more than 56 years, including 30-plus years with the Magic and 51 years in the NBA Pat Williams announced his retirement. https://www.nba.com/magic/magic-co-founder-senior-vice-president-pat-williams- announces-retirement Major League Baseball expansion efforts On November 20, 2019, Williams held a press conference announcing the start of an effort to bring a major-league baseball team to Orlando, Florida. The suggested name for this franchise is the Orlando Dreamers. He cited the a strong built-in fan base and the rapidly growing city population as reasons why Orlando should be considered for an expansion team. Williams indicated he will continue to gauge Orlando's interest in a baseball team and then, based on those results, determine what the next steps should be.[https://theathletic.com/1396017/2019/11/20/baseball-in-orlando/ Family Pat met his first wife, Jill, during his time in Chicago. They married in 1973 and divorced in 1996, being the parents of 18 children, 4 biological and 14 adopted from four nations between 1983 and 1993. His daughter Karyn is a Christian singer, and son Bobby a pro scout for the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. In 1997, he married his current wife Ruth, a consultant with FranklinCovey Co., who brought to the house a child of her own. Awards He is a member of the Wake Forest Sports Hall of Fame after catching for the Deacon baseball team, including the 1962 Atlantic Coast Conference Championship team. He was inducted into the Delaware Sports Museum and Hall of Fame in 2001. He won the DECA Entrepreneurial Spirit award at DECA's International Career Development Conference in 2011. On February 24, 2012, Williams was announced as that year's winner of the John Bunn Award, presented annually by the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame for significant lifetime contributions to the sport.

Born in Charlottetown, he is noted for being one of only three major-league players from Prince Edward Island, the others being 19th-century players George Wood and Henry Oxley.\\"George (Dandy) Wood inducted into Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame\\", Journal Pioneer, June 22, 2011. Handrahan threw right-handed, batted left-handed, and was listed as tall and (13 stone, 3 pounds). He was originally signed by the Milwaukee Braves as a 22-year-old amateur in . After playing sandlot and youth baseball in his native city, then pitching in a semi-professional league for Stellarton, Nova Scotia, in the heart of that province's coal mining country, he was signed by veteran Braves scout Lucius \\"Jeff\\" Jones,Moscovitch, Philip (2012), \\"Right Place, Right Time.\\" Saltscapes whose territory encompassed New England and Atlantic Canada. Handrahan spent four years at the lower levels of the Braves' farm system before the Athletics selected him in the minor league draft. He made the Kansas City roster out of spring training in 1964, and worked in 18 games between April 14 and June 9. Sent to Triple-A, he didn't return to the majors until Kansas City recalled him in the middle of 1966 for a 16-game audition. Handrahan made two starts for the Athletics, one in 1964 and the other in 1966, and they resulted in both of his MLB decisions: defeats at the hands of the Los Angeles Angels on May 5, 1964,Retrosheet box score (5 May 1964): \\"Los Angeles Angels 8, Kansas City Athletics 1\\" and the Chicago White Sox on April 17, 1966.Retrosheet box score (17 August 1966, Game 2): \\"Chicago White Sox 5, Kansas City Athletics 1\\" He earned his only big-league save in his penultimate MLB appearance when he worked a scoreless one-third of an inning against the Cleveland Indians to nail down a 1‚Äì0 Kansas City triumph on September 15, 1966.Retrosheet box score (15 September 1966): \\"Kansas City Athletics 1, Cleveland Indians 0 (11 innings)\\" Handrahan returned to minor league baseball in 1967 for the remainder of his 12-season career.

Its origins stem from live pigeon shooting as well as the very beginnings of the clay target sort. DTL now forms part of the family of trap disciplines and in number of competitors is undoubtedly the largest variant, especially in the Commonwealth countries where it is most popular. Competitors use a double barrelled shotgun, usually 'under-and-over' type, and are allowed to fire both barrels at a single target released on the traditional call of 'Pull!'. The maximum load permitted is 28g per cartridge, slightly larger than the Olympic disciplines which use a standard 24g load.  Layout and rules  The traditional DTL shooting layout is set up with 5 stands in a crescent shape 16 yards from a traphouse, which throws a random target from an oscillating trap between 0 and 22.5 degrees to either side of a center post, set 50‚Äì55 yards from the traphouse. The clay should always be on a common trajectory for height, even though it is variable in horizontal angle. The average speed for a down the line clay target leaving the traphouse is usually 42mph +/- 1mph. A normal competition would have the competitor shooting at 100 targets in total in a day. This would be built up of 25 targets at 4 different layouts (traps) with 5 targets shot on each stand rotating on a 1 > 2 >>> 5 basis, hence 100 targets total. The scoring of points is 3 points for first barrel kill, 2 points for a second barrel kill, 0 points for a lost target. A perfect score is therefore 100 targets each 'killed' with the first barrel, total 300 points. The 100/300 is a real achievement, the 4-minute mile or the 147 break of the trap shooter. Scores are expressed with number of kills followed by number of points e.g. 98/292 would mean 2 birds missed completely and a total of 8 points dropped due to having second barreled 2 including missing 2. Competitions are decided only by points, so this score would beat a 100/291. The competition is shot in 'squads' of a maximum of 5 shooters occupying the 5 stands which are also called pegs. These squads are not usually teams as such, but groups of individual shooters shooting in turn i.e. Competitor 1 on peg 1 shoots 1 target; then competitor 2 on peg 2; etc. until each has shot 5 targets from each peg. They then move one peg to the right before shooting a further 5 shots in turn from that peg and so on until 5 shots have been taken from all 5 pegs, the 25 targets on that layout (aka trap). DTL is perhaps the 'easier' single shot to make of any clay shooting discipline, but the result is an incredibly high standard of competition. Even a small club shoot will see almost perfect scores posted by the better shots, so concentration and mental strength are the real talents displayed by competitors.  Regulation  Most governing bodies record their members scores from every registered competition and then grade the competitors into classes, similar to a golf handicap. These classes are AA (nominally the elite shooters), A (expert), B (intermediate) and C (novice). Prizes are awarded in each class so competitors are shooting both for the overall 'HIGH GUN' (HG) and against their peers in their respective class. Averages are reassessed periodically (every six months in the UK for example) and shooters re-classified according to form. There are further demarkations for Juniors, Colts, Ladies, Vets (60+) and Super Vets (65+), who will also be competing for HG and class honours. There are often further classes for disabled competitors, or for competitors who use wheelchairs. For major international events or Inter-County (IC) championships, teams representing each country or county may be formed. The sport is very inclusive ‚Äì a novice shooter can find themselves on a squad alongside a World Champion, his wife, grandfather and grandson competing on equal terms. Competitors come from every walk of life and as entry to a typical club competition is on average around ¬£30 and cartridges for an event perhaps the same again, the cost of competition is modest. It is certainly not the preserve of the wealthy. Most shooting grounds will offer trial lessons and experience days. Other variations are double rise DR, single barrel SB, automatic ball trap ABT, and handicap by distance HPD. The governing bodies in the UK and Ireland are the Clay Pigeon Shooting Associationhttp://www.cpsa.co.uk (CPSA; England), Irish Clay Pigeon Shooting Associationhttp://www.icpsa.ie (IPSCA), Ulster Clay Pigeon Shooting Associationhttp://www.ucpsa.com (UCPSA; Northern Ireland), Scottish Clay Target AssociationScottish Clay Target Association. Clay Pigeon Shooting (SCTA) and Welsh Clay Target Shooting Associationhttp://www.wctsa.co.uk (WCTSA). Events In the UK, the British DTL Championships are held in July every year, namely the Home Internationals and British Open events. These are held every year on rotation between England, Ireland, Scotland, Wales and, the newest inclusion, Northern Ireland. The Home International (HI) consists of all host countries competing with teams of 25 seniors, 5 ladies, 5 veterans and 5 juniors to become the winning nation. The main competition is between the seniors with their greatest involvement in the event, although there is great pride shown when the other teams win their specific competition. On the night after the international there is a hosted banquet in which the prizes for the day are handed out. The British Open has an element of the previous days activities with the teams competing but greater emphasis is put on the competition of the overall British senior, ladies, veteran and junior champions. Northern Ireland hosted their first ever DTL Home International and British Open in 2006 at Culbann C.P.C, Ballynease, County Londonderry. This event was the culmination of a lot of preparation from Culbann C.P.C, by upgrading from a 4-layout facility to an 8-layout facility. Through the upgrading of the ground, the 4 layouts originally used were deemed redundant and they have been demolished to make space for the 8 new layouts. It was a great time for Northern Ireland as not only hosting the event for the first time, they managed to walk away as the overall winners of the Home International 2006. In 2014 the championships will be hosted by Bywell SG in Northumberland, England. There are several 'major' competitions every year in the UK, each attracting around 600 or more competitors. Competition is usually over two days, though some are one day, and sponsor or preliminary/warm up shoots take place on the days leading up to the main event. Amongst these are the Krieghoff at Mid Wales SG, Perazzi at Bywell SG and the Dougall Memorial (shot since 1903), the English Open and the British Open which move from ground to ground. There are also the Euros held each year, that will attract teams and competitors from other nations such as France, Sweden, Germany amongst many others. Every two years, the DTL World Championships are held, alternating between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. In 2014 New Zealand host the 11th Worlds, following Wales in 2012, South Africa in 2010, Ireland in 2008, Australia in 2006. It returns to Ireland in 2016. This is held over three days with 100 targets shot on each of the first two days, then a further 50 on the morning of day three. Scores are collated and the top 10% of competitors in each class (AA, A, B and C) proceed to shoot a further 50 targets (total 300) and the scores are added to the previous 250 to decide the places. Shoot offs are held to determine any significant places where tied. See also * List of British sport shooters References External links *Clay Pigeon Shooting Assoc.

Career Beriosova made her professional debut in 1947 with Nesta Toumine's Ottawa Ballet. In 1952, after appearing with several major companies, including the Grand Ballet de Monte Carlo and the Metropolitan Ballet, she joined the Sadler's Wells Ballet, where she became prima ballerina in 1955. Notable among her leading roles there was Swanilda in Copp√©lia, which allowed her to showcase her rarely used comic talent. She was better known for her eloquent and elegant classical style, which was highlighted in the many leading roles she created, such as Princess Belle Rose in John Cranko's The Prince of the Pagodas (1957), the Fairy in Kenneth MacMillan's Le Baiser de la f√©e (The Fairy's Kiss, 1960), and Lady Elgar in Frederick Ashton's Enigma Variations (1968). She also danced such traditional classical roles as Odette/Odile in Swan Lake, Aurora in The Sleeping Beauty, and the title role in Giselle. As well as dancing the entire classical repertoire, Beriosova created the leading part in several modern ballets, notably the title role in Cranko's Antigone (1959). In one of her more unusual modern parts, the title role of Ashton's Persephone (1961), she recited Andr√© Gide's poetry in French in addition to dancing to the music of Igor Stravinsky. Plagued by illness and injuries, Beriosova performed very little in the 1970s. She retired in 1975 but continued to coach young dancers. On her retirement from dancing, she became a popular teacher and dancers' coach, working in public onstage in Maina Gielgud's Steps, Notes and Squeaks in 1978 and 1980. Personal life Born in Kaunas, Lithuania, the daughter of Nicolas Beriosoff (or Nicolas Beriozoff) (1906‚Äì1996), a Lithuanian ballet master of ethnic Russian descent who immigrated to England. Beriosova came to the United States in 1940 , where she studied ballet. Her mother died in New York when she was 10 years old. Beriosova's was married to psychoanalyst Masud Khan on January 23, 1959, and they divorced in 1974 after 15 years. She was close friend to actress/singer Julie Andrews, and was the godmother to scenic designer/theatre director Tony Walton's daughter, Emma Walton Hamilton, Nathalie Ghent, Harold Morris' daughter, Nadia Ghent, and to Dimitri Kullmann. Beriosova died from cancer, aged 66, in Kensington, London in 1998. She was survived by a cousin, Elvira Svetlana Surkevicius.

Its administrative centre is the town of Playa Grande. The municipality consists of 176 communities, called aldeas. It has an area of 1693 km2. It is the northernmost municipality of El Quich√©, and borders with Mexico, the municipalities of Chisec and Cob√°n of the Department of Alta Verapaz, the municipality of Santa Cruz Barillas of the Department of Huehuetenango, and the municipalities of Chajul and Uspant√°n of El Quich√©. Native Mayan languages include Q'eqchi', Q'anjob'al, Mam, Popti and K'iche'. Spanish is also common. Its annual festival is held from the 15th to the 17th of May. Ixc√°n has an airport. Its International Air Transport Association code is PKJ.  History  = Oil potential = In 1971 indigenous Q'eqchi' people from 24 villages in the Cancu√©n area, in southern Pet√©n north of Chisec, were evicted by the Army, because it considered that the region was rich in oil. Since 1974, oil had been commercially extracted in the FTN vicinity following discoveries made by Shenandoah Oil and Basic Resources, which were operating together in the Rubelsanto oil field in Alta Verapaz. In 1976, when ten president Kjell Laugerud Garc√≠a came to visit the Mayal√°n cooperative in Ixc√°n, Quich√© -which was formed just 10 years before- said: \\"Mayal√°n is seated on top of the gold,\\" hinting that the North Transversal Strip would no longer be used for agriculture and the cooperative movement, but rather by strategic exploitation of natural resources. After that presidential visit, the two oil companies conducted exploration in Xacbal, near Mayal√°n in Ixc√°n, where they drilled the \\"San Lucas\\" well with unsuccessful results. These initial exploration, however, paved the way for future Ixc√°n and FTN oil experimentation, were also the main reason for building the dirt road that runs along the Strip. Shenandoah Oil, the National Institute of Agrarian Reform (INTA) and the Army Engineer Battalion coordinated the construction of that corridor between 1975 and 1979, which eventually allowed political, military and powerful businessmen of the time become owners of many lands where potential timber and oil wealth lay. High Guatemalan government officers became large landowners and investors taking advantage of the peasant transfer policies, privileged insider information, expansion of public credit and major development projects; the Army entered the business world with the Bank of the Army, pension funds and others. = Participation of Fernando Romeo Lucas Garc√≠a in FTN = In 1977, when he stepped down as defense minister to pursue his presidential campaign, general Fernando Romeo Lucas Garc√≠a also happened to hold the position of coordinator of the Northern Transversal Strip, whose main objective was to bring oil production and to facilitate oil exploitation of that vast land. By managing this project, Lucas Garc√≠a obtained greater knowledge and interaction with the transnational companies that were in the area, and increased his own personal economic interests in the region, given that his family owned land there and he had commercial relationships with Shenandoah Oil company.* During Lucas Garc√≠a government (1 July 1978 ‚Äì 23 March 1982) the Army Engineers Battalion built the road stretch from Cadenas (Pet√©n / Izabal) to Fray Bartolom√© de las Casas. After the overthrow of Lucas Garc√≠a March 23, 1982, a military triumvirate came to power headed by General Efra√≠n R√≠os Montt, along with Horacio Maldonado Shaad colonels and Francisco Gordillo. On June 2, 1982, international journalists conducted an interview with R√≠os Montt, who said the following regarding Lucas Garc√≠a government and FTN:  Civil war in Guatemala  Pacifist mural depicting the Victory of January 20 in Ixc√°n Xalbal River = The Guerrilla Army of the Poor = On January 19, 1972 members of a new Guatemalan guerrilla movement entered Ixc√°n, from Mexico, and were accepted by many farmers; in 1973, after an exploratory foray into the municipal seat of Cotzal, the insurgent group set up camp underground in the mountains of Xolchich√©, in the municipality of Chajul. In 1974 the insurgent guerrilla group held its first conference, and named itself the Guerrilla Army of the Poor (Ej√©rcito Guerrillero de los Pobres) (EGP). In 1975 the organization had spread around the area of the mountains of northern municipalities of Nebaj and Chajul. As part of its strategy EGP agreed to perform acts to seek notoriety and to symbolize the establishment of \\"social justice\\" against the inefficiency and ineffectiveness of the judicial and administrative organs of the State. They saw also that with these actions the indigenous rural population of the region identified with the insurgency, thus motivating them joining their ranks. This plan included so-called \\"executions\\". To determine who would be these people subject to \\"execution\\", the EGP attended complaints received from the public. For example, they selected two victims: Guillermo Monz√≥n, a military Commissioner in Ixc√°n, and Jos√© Luis Arenas, the largest landowner in the area of Ixc√°n, reported to the EGP for allegedly having land conflicts with neighboring settlements and abusing their workers. On Saturday, 7 June 1975, Jos√© Luis Arenas was killed by unknowns when he was at his farm, \\"La Perla\\", to pay wage workers. In front of his office approximately two to three hundred people waited for payment, and four members of the EGP mixed among farmers. The guerrillas destroyed the communication radio of the farm and executed Arenas. They spoke in Ixil language to the farmers, telling them that they were members of the Guerrilla Army of the Poor and had killed the \\"Tiger Ixc√°n.\\" They requested to prepare beasts to help the injured and were transported to Chajul to receive medical care. Then the attackers fled towards Chajul. Jos√© Luis Arenas' son, who was in San Luis Ixc√°n at the time, sought refuge on a nearby mountain, waiting for a plane to arrive to take him to the capital, to immediately report the matter to the Minister of Defense. The defense minister replied, \\"You are mistaken, there are no guerrillas in the area\\". The report of the Recovery of Historical Memory lists 422 massacres committed by both sides in the conflict; however, it also states that they did the best they could in terms of obtaining information and therefore the list is incomplete; therefore here are the cases that have also been documented in other reports as well. { class=\\"mw-collapsible mw-collapsed wikitable\\" style=\\"text-align:center; background:white; width:60%;\\" + align=\\"center\\" style=\\"background:#ffffff; color:black\\"Chajul, Nebaj and Ixc√°n massacres during Guatemala Civil War - style=\\"color:white;\\" !style=\\"background:#659ec7;\\" width=\\"5%\\"# !style=\\"background:#659ec7;\\" width=\\"20%\\"Location !style=\\"background:#659ec7;\\" width=\\"10%\\"Department !style=\\"background:#659ec7;\\" width=\\"10%\\"Date !style=\\"background:#659ec7;\\"Description - !style=\\"background:lemonchiffon;\\"1 Ilom (village), ChajulQuich√©23 March 1982After 1981 repression against Ilom was rampant, ending with the massacre of 96 alleged guerilla members in front of their families on 23 March 1982, as part of Army \\"Victoria 82\\" plan.

In January 1982, EGP attacked Cotzal military base; the attack lasted 2 hours and 20 minutes, resulting 100 military casualties and 20 for the guerilla.

In 1985, Ixc√°n was granted status as a separate municipality from San Miguel Uspant√°n. Economy =Xalal√° hydroelectric dam= The Xalal√° hydroelectric dam is a proposed development project in Ixc√°n. It is controversial because it will flood 31.8 km2 and displace twelve Q'eqchi' Maya communities. It is a project of the Plan Puebla Panama. The dam is opposed by the Organizational Commission of the Community Consultation of Good Faith in Ixc√°n, which wants the (INDE) to consult with local indigenous groups pursuant to the International Labour Organization Convention No. 169, Article 7. The municipal government called for such a consultation on 2007-04-20, in which 90% of voters rejected all proposed hydroelectric projects and petroleum extraction in the region. = African oil palm = African oil palm plantation areas in Guatemala as of 2014. There is a large demand within Guatemala and some of its neighbors for edible oils and fats, which would explain how the African oil palm became so prevalent in the country in detriment of other oils, and which has allowed new companies associated to large capitals in a new investment phase that can be found particularly in some territories that form the Northern Transversal Strip of Guatemala. The investors are trying to turn Guatemala into one of the main palm oil exporters, in spite of the decline on its international price. The most active region is found in Chisec and Cob√°n, in Alta Verapaz Department; Ixc√°n in Quich√© Department, and Sayaxch√©, Pet√©n Department, where Palmas del Ixc√°n, S.A.

The Fox derivative and related concepts are often referred to as the Fox calculus, or (Fox's original term) the free differential calculus. The Fox derivative was developed in a series of five papers by mathematician Ralph Fox, published in Annals of Mathematics beginning in 1953. Definition If G is a free group with identity element e and generators gi, then the Fox derivative with respect to gi is a function from G into the integral group ring ZG which is denoted \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial g_i}, and obeys the following axioms: * \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial g_i}(g_j) = \\\\delta_{ij}, where \\\\delta_{ij} is the Kronecker delta * \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial g_i}(e) = 0 * \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial g_i}(uv) = \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial g_i}(u) + u\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial g_i}(v) for any elements u and v of G. The first two axioms are identical to similar properties of the partial derivative of calculus, and the third is a modified version of the product rule. As a consequence of the axioms, we have the following formula for inverses * \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial g_i}(u^{-1}) = -u^{-1}\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial g_i}(u) for any element u of G.

In 1969, James was initiated into the Gaudiya Vaishnava tradition by A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, whereupon he was given the name Jayatirtha Dasa. In the beginning of the 1970s he served as a president of the Los Angeles ISKCON temple and as a president of Spiritual Sky Enterprises, a group of family-style businesses founded by ISKCON. At the time, Spiritual Sky was the largest incense manufacturer in the US, and the only legitimate business of the society. ISKCON GBC member and initiating guru Jayatirtha later went on to become a senior leader and preacher within the movement, a member of its management body known as the Governing Body Commission, and the head of ISKCON in Europe. In 1975, Jayatirtha was sent by Prabhupada \\"to take over and organise\\" the Hare Krishna movement in Great Britain. Jayatirtha resided with his family at Bhaktivedanta Manor, a beautiful manor house donated by George Harrison to ISKCON. He travelled extensively throughout the world under the direction of Swami Prapupada and performed the Vedic ritual of Pratista (deity installation ) in numerous temples. He was commended by Swami Prabhupada for his refined abilities in arcana padati (the process of deity worship) which set the standard of deity worship throughout the society. He co-compiled a handbook under Swami Prabhupada's direction to assist all authorized students in that process. He was also chief editor of The Maha Bharat Times; a news paper which highlighted the concerns of the Hindu community of Great Britain. The last place Swami Prabhupada visited in the western hemisphere before his departure was Bhaktivedanta Manor, where he embraced Jayatirtha saying \\"your name is Tirtha I have come to take shelter of you,\\" before returning to Vrindavan in India to take Samadhi (die). Jayatirtha was the only member of the G.B.C. who did not follow Swami Prabhupada back to India to witness their Guru's departure. In the aftermath of Swami Prabhupada's death, Jayatirtha was one of eleven disciples selected to become an initiating guru. He was located in London and was responsible for initiating disciples and managing ISKCON in Great Britain and South Africa. Due to his capabilities and organizational power, the Hare Krishna movement has significantly expanded and developed in those countries. In December 1980, Jayatirtha bought Croome Court, an estate in Worcestershire south of Birmingham. He renamed it Chaitanya College, looking to introduce an ISKCON college degree in the Vaishnava tradition. The estate included a two-hundred-room mansion, a chapel and various outbuildings. It was built in 1750 for the Earl of Coventry by Lancelot \\"Capability\\" Brown. The design of the interiors was made by Robert Adam. The property included of fields and landscaped parkland. During the World War II, the place served as a residence for Queen of the Netherlands. Jayatirtha spent hundreds of thousands of pounds restoring the property and turning the chapel into the Hare Krishna temple. Jayatirtha frequently lectured about the divine love of Radha and Krishna. He had been holding long kirtan sessions, which were considered by other GBC members to be interfering with the street collections and accumulation of funds by the society members. His concentrated focus on spiritual practices were in some respects a cause for concern. Jayatirtha always maintained that a divine flow of spiritual energy descended upon him at that time and refuted the allegations that his deep meditations were the result of taking LSD. The meditations which he entered into during kirtan (congregational chanting) sessions were conducted with composure, often with his eyes closed, whilst sitting crossed legged and with a straight back. Jayatirtha's responsibilities within ISKCON required him to make regular visits to Africa, India, U.S.A and other countries although he resided with his family in the U.K. His influence in South Africa was one of the major contributing factors to reversing the trend of Hindu conversions to Islam. During his visits to India, in his free time, he would travel to remote holy places for meditation. The Governing Body Commission suspected that Jayatirtha's meditations or so called ecstasies were the symptoms of drug use. Jayatirtha became \\"the topic of serious conversations among GBC members\\". During a GBC meeting in Los Angeles (called to deal with problems of another Hare Krishna guru, Hansadutta Swami) Jayatirtha was relieved from all his responsibilities in ISKCON for one year and required to renounce his wife and take sannyasa. The sannyasa initiation ceremony took place in LA Hare Krishna temple and was conducted by Kirtanananda Swami. Although Jayathirtha begged and pleaded with the GBC not to enforce the sannyasa order upon him, especially as he had not consulted with his family members, his pleading fell on deaf ears. GBC members hoped that taking sannyasa would help Jayatirtha to overcome the problems in spiritual life, but Jayatirtha was unhappy in ISKCON after that. He started to \\"shift his loyalty away from ISKCON leadership to Shridhara Swami\\", a godbrother of A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, who lived in West Bengal. At the spring 1982 GBC annual meeting in Mayapur, Jayatirtha was told, that if he did not stop seeing Shridhara Swami, he would be removed from his leadership post in ISKCON. In response, Jayatirtha walked off the ISKCON Mayapur property taking nothing with him and took refuge in the Gaudiya Math ashram of Shridhara Swami. Shridhara Swami, being a senior Gaudiya Vashnava leader, was concerned about the growing tension in ISKCON. He tried to mediate various problems, but usually only drew fire on himself as a result. Many of Prabhupada's disciples, disillusioned with the existing \\"zonal guru system\\" in ISKCON at the time left the organization and turned to Shridhara Swami and Gaudiya Math in search of spiritual renewal. Consequently, the GBC considered Shridhara Swami a threat, especially when such senior ISKCON members as Jayatirtha took his side. Withdrawal from ISKCON At the 1982 meeting, the GBC instructed Jayatirtha Maharaja that he must forgo any contact with Sridhara Maharaja or else leave ISKCON, otherwise he would be condemned for \\"failing to cooperate with the ISKCON movement\\". To stabilize Jayatirtha's zone, the GBC turned it to another guru, Bhagavan, who reinitiated some of Jayatirtha's disciples. Under Bhagavan's leadership, Hare Krishna devotees in UK went on a year-long marathon to collect funds to save British ISKCON properties. Unable to pay high mortgage payments, Bhagavan eventually had to sell Croome Court estate. ISKCON in the absence of jayatirtha's managerial skills was becoming unviable. Some of Jayatirtha's disciples fled from London to India and joined their guru, creating \\"the first formal schismatic offshoot from ISKCON\\". Jayatirtha's new splinter group became based in London and he renamed his former ISKCON disciples with biblical names. Finally, he left his London temple and went to Nepal with a small group of students and founded The Order of Pilgrims which later became established in South Africa. Literature and philosophies A booklet \\"Notes of a Pilgrim\\" written by Jayatirtha shortly after his departure from ISKCON, highlights his personal experience and reflections of the society and its leaders. He translated the Bhagavad Gita from Sanskrit to English, \\"Bhagavad Gita: The Eternal Song Goes On\\". Jayatirtha was an admirer of Mahatma Gandhi and wrote articles and gave discourses on the Gandhian principles of ahimsa and satyagraha. He was the founder of the concept for the Gandhian Organisation for Peace and Liberty (GOPAL TRUST) a registered charity currently running projects in Jagannath Puri, Bay of Bengal, India. He purchased a large plot of land in Puri in conjunction with H. Desai, a Gandhian freedom fighter, for the purpose of establishing a Gandhian ashram there. Death On November 13, 1987, five years after Jayatirtna had left ISKCON, he was murdered by his disciple Antony Tiernan.Krishna killer beheaded his guru! Antony Tiernan was viewed by many of Jayatirtha's serious minded students as a man on the edge with a fanatical and unpredictable streak, who proclaimed himself to be the topmost disciple. Although he was caught redhanded, he was not tried for murder and pleaded guilty to manslaughter on grounds of diminished responsibility. The trial date was changed at the last moment and although friends and family of Jayatirtha had flown from America to London to attend the trial, it went ahead unbeknown to them, his family in the U.K. and his students alike. Not a single person known to Jayatirtha was present in the court room other than the murderer, who had slashed a surface cut across his palms at the scene of the crime to solicit pity upon himself. The bereft community that had been working with and under the guidance of Jayatirtha, while waiting for the date the trial was to commence, were shocked to read of the outcome in the newspapers. A proposal by an editor to publish his obituary in ISKCON World Review was turned down by the editor-in-chief, Mukunda Goswami, in spite of the fact that Jayatirtha was one of the senior members of ISKCON and an early supporter of ISKCON World Review.

In the Tillamook State Forest, the peak is also the highest peak in the Northern Oregon Coast Range, which is the northern section of the Oregon Coast Range.  Geology  The origins of these mountains began approximately 40 million years ago during the Eocene age. During this time period, sandstone and siltstone formed in the area. Additionally, igneous rocks and basalt flows combined with basaltic sandstone to create many of the mountainous formations. Other sedimentary rock in the area formed more recently, around 20 million years ago. It is hypothesized that portions of the area were islands during parts of the Eocene era. The entire coast range sits on a convergent tectonic margin interacting with the Juan de Fuca Plate that is subducting beneath North America tectonic plate. The range is part of a broad, plunging structural arch of sedimentary and Tertiary volcanic strata that is being uplifted. Other portions of the mountains consist of marine sedimentary rock. The basalt in the area comes from basalt flows that covered much of Oregon that originated from fissures in the central portion of the state. It was during the middle Miocene period that the range was uplifted in the broad, northeast-plunging arch.  Flora and fauna  Forested parts of the mountain include Sitka spruce, western redcedar, Douglas-fir, and western hemlock. Other plant life native to the mountain are Coptis laciniata, salmonberry, salal, sword fern, Oregon grape, bracken fern, and others. Invertebrates include millipedes, collembolans, spiders, beetles, and various centipedes. Animals that inhabit the area are weasels, chipmunks. black bears, snowshoe hares and deer. Birds include chickadees, kinglets, woodpeckers, jays, brown creepers, and red crossbills.  Location  Rogers Peak is approximately north of Lees Camp on Oregon Route 6 with access via North Fork Road. Hiking the mountain is about a round-trip with an elevation gain of about . The mountain, located on private timber land, is near the Oregon Coast.  Name history  In 1964 the mountain officially became Rogers Peak. Previously, it had also been referred to as Blue Lake Peak and Nels Rogers Peak. The mountain was named for Nelson S. Rogers, who was the Oregon State Forester from 1940-1949. He was a prominent figure in the rehabilitation of the Tillamook Burn.

He sought to revive Islam, and to propagate what he understood to be \\"true Islam\\". He believed that Islam was essential for politics, and that it was necessary to institute sharia and preserve Islamic culture similar to the reign of Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb and abandon immorality, from what he viewed as the evils of secularism, nationalism and socialism, which he understood to be the influence of Western imperialism. He was the founder of the Jamaat-e-Islami, the then largest Islamic organisation in Asia. At the time of the Indian independence movement, Maududi and the Jamaat-e-Isami actively worked to oppose the partition of India. After it occurred, Maududi and his followers shifted their focus to politicizing Islam and generating support for making Pakistan an Islamic state. They are thought to have helped inspire General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq to introduce \\"Sharization\\" to Pakistan, and to have been greatly strengthened by him after tens of thousands of members and sympathizers were given jobs in the judiciary and civil service during his administration. He was the first recipient of the Saudi Arabian King Faisal International Award for his service to Islam in 1979. Maududi was part of establishing and running of Islamic University of Madinah, Saudi Arabia. He has been the second person in history whose absentee funeral was observed in the Kaaba, succeeding King Ashama ibn-Abjar. Early life =Background= Maududi was born in the city of Aurangabad in colonial India, then part of the princely state enclave of Hyderabad. He was the youngest of three sons of Ahmad Hasan, a lawyer by profession. Although his father was only middle-class, he was the descendant of the Chishti; in fact his last name was derived from the first member of the Chishti Silsilah, i.e. Khawajah Syed Qutb ul-Din Maudood Chishti (d. 527 AH). He stated that his paternal family originally moved from Chicht, in modern-day Afghanistan, during the days of Sikandar Lodi (d. 1517), initially settling in the state of Haryana before moving to Delhi later on, and on his mother's side, his ancestor Mirza Tulak, a soldier of Turkish origin, moved into India from Transoxiana around the times of emperor Aurangzeb (d. 1707),Omar Khalidi, \\"MaulƒÅnƒÅ Mawd≈´dƒ´ and Hyderabad\\" in Islamic Studies, Vol. 41, No. 1 (Spring 2002), pp. 37-38 while his maternal grandfather, Mirza Qurban Ali Baig Khan Salik (1816-1881), was a writer and poet in Delhi, a friend of the Urdu poet Ghalib.Vali Nasr, Mawdudi and the Making of Islamic Revivalism, Oxford University Press (1996), p. 11 = Childhood = Until he was nine, Maududi \\"received religious nurture at the hands of his father and from a variety of teachers employed by him.\\" As his father wanted him to become a maulvi, this education consisted of learning Arabic, Persian, Islamic law and hadith.Irfan Ahmed in The Princeton Encyclopedia of Islamic Political Thought (collective), Princeton University Press (2013), p. 333 He also studied books of mantiq (logic).Roy Jackson, Mawlana Mawdudi and Political Islam: Authority and the Islamic state, Routledge (2010), p. 18Vali Nasr, Mawdudi and the Making of Islamic Revivalism, Oxford University Press (1996), p. 12 A precocious child, he translated Qasim Amin's al-Marah al-jadidah (\\"The New Woman\\"), a modernist and feminist work, from Arabic into Urdu at the age of 11.Roy Jackson, Mawlana Mawdudi and Political Islam: Authority and the Islamic state, Routledge (2010), p. 19Vali Nasr, Mawdudi and the Making of Islamic Revivalism, Oxford University Press (1996), p. 13 In the field of translation, years later, he also worked on some 3,500 pages from Asfar, the major work of the 17th century Persian-Shi'a mystical thinker Mulla Sadra.Muhammad Suheyl Umar, \\"... hikmat i mara ba madrasah keh burd?

He then moved to a more traditionalist Darul Uloom in Hyderabad. Meanwhile, his father shifted to Bhopal ‚Äì there Maududi befriended Niaz Fatehpuri, another modernist ‚Äì where he suffered a severe paralysis attack and died leaving no property or money, forcing his son to abort his education. In 1919, by the time he was 16, and still a modernist in mindset, he moved to Delhi and read books by his distant relative, the reformist Sayyid Ahmad Khan. He also learned English and German in order to study, intensively, Western philosophy, sociology and history for full five years : he eventually came up to the conclusion that \\"ulama' in the past did not endeavor to discover the causes of Europe's rise, and he offered a long list of philosophers whose scholarship had made Europe a world power : Fichte, Hegel, Comte, Mill, Turgot, Adam Smith, Malthus, Rousseau, Voltaire, Montesquieu, Darwin, Goethe, and Herder, among others. Comparing their contribution to that of Muslims, he concluded that the latter's did not reach even 1 percent.\\" =Journalism= Even if he began to get seriously involved in journalism from the early 1920s onwards, being appointed editor of the leading weekly Urdu newspaper Taj of Jabalpur in 1920 at the age of 17,Khurshid Ahmad & Zafar Ishaq Ansari, MawlƒÅnƒÅ Mawd≈´dƒ´: An Introduction to His Life and Thought, Islamic Foundation (1979), p. 7 he also resumed his studies as an autodidact in 1921, notably through the influence of some members of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind, by studying the Dars-e-Nizami and subjects such as adab (literature), mantiq (logiq), and kalam (theology and philosophy.)Vali Nasr, Mawdudi and the Making of Islamic Revivalism, Oxford University Press (1996), p. 17 Mawdudi got ijazahs (certificates and diplomas in traditional Islamic learning) but never called himself an 'alim in the formal sense because he found the Islamic scholars to be regressive, even though some Deobandi influence on him would remain:Roy Jackson, Mawlana Mawdudi and Political Islam: Authority and the Islamic state, Routledge (2010), pp. 29‚Äì30 > I do not have the prerogative to belong to the class of Ulema. I am a man of > the middle cadre, who has imbibed something from both the systems of > education, the new and the old; and has gathered my knowledge by traversing > both paths. By virtue of my inner light, I conclude that neither the old > school nor the new is totally in the right. From 1924 to 1927 Maududi was the editor of al-Jamiah, the newspaper of the Jamiyat-i Ulama (an organization of Islamic clergy), a position of \\"extreme importance and influence.\\" Always interested in independence from the British, Maududi lost faith in the Congress Party and its Muslim allies in the 1920s as the party developed an increasingly Hindu identity. He began to turn more towards Islam, and believed that Democracy could be a viable option for Muslims only if the majority of Indians were Muslim. Maududi spent some time in Delhi as a young man but went back to Hyderabad in 1928. =Political writings= Birthplace of Abul Ala Maududi (Cheli pura currently Manzoor pura) Aurangabad India Maududi's works were written and published throughout his life, including influential works from 1933 to 1941. Maududi's most well known work, and widely considered his most important and influential work, is the Tafhim-ul-Quran (Urdu: ÿ™ŸÅ€ÅŸäŸÖ ÿßŸÑŸÇÿ±ÿ¢ŸÜ, romanized: Towards Understanding the Qur'an), a 6-volume translation and commentary of the Qur'an by Maududi which Maududi spent many years writing (which was begun in Muharram, 1361 A.H./February 1942). In 1932 he joined another journal (Tarjuman al-Quran) and from 1932 to 1937 he began to develop his political ideas, and turn towards the cause of Islamic revivalism and Islam as an ideology, as opposed to what he called \\"traditional and hereditary religion\\". The government of Hyderabad helped support the journal buying 300 subscriptions which it donated to libraries around India. Maududi was alarmed by the decline of Muslim ruled Hyderabad, the increasing secularism and lack of Purdah among Muslim women in Delhi. By 1937 he became in conflict with Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind and its support for a pluralistic Indian society where the Jamiat hoped Muslims could \\"thrive ... without sacrificing their identity or interests.\\" Madrasa e Furqania Aurangbad (currently Zilah parishad office) India In that year he also married Mahmudah Begum, a woman from an old Muslim family with \\"considerable financial resources\\". The family provide financial help and allowed him to devote himself to research and political action, but his wife had \\"liberated\\", modern ways, and at first rode a bicycle and did not observe purdah. She was given greater latitude by Maududi than were other Muslims. Political activity At this time he also began work on establishing an organization for Da'wah (propagation and preaching of Islam) that would be an alternative to both the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League. At this time he decided to leave Hyderabad for Northwest India, closer to the Muslim political center of gravity in India. In 1938, after meeting the famous Muslim poet Muhammad Iqbal, Maududi moved to a piece of land in the village of Pathankot in the Punjab to oversee a Waqf (Islamic foundation) called Daru'l-Islam. His hope was to make it a \\"nerve center\\" of Islamic revival in India, an ideal religious community, providing leaders and the foundation for a genuine religious movement. He wrote to various Muslim luminaries invited them to join him there. The community, like Jamaat-i-Islami later, was composed of rukn (members), a shura' (a consultative council), and a sadr (head). After a dispute with the person who donated the land for the community over Maududi's anti-nationalist politics, Maududi quit the waqf and in 1939 moved the Daru'l-Islam with its membership from Pathankot to Lahore. In Lahore he was hired by Islamiyah College but was sacked after less than a year for his openly political lectures. =Founding the Jamaat-i-Islami= Main entrance of the House of Syed Abul A'la Maududi 4-A, Zaildar Park, Ichhra, Lahore In August 1941, Maududi founded Jamaat-e-Islami (JI) in British India as a religious political movement to promote Islamic values and practices. His Mission was supported by eminent scholars such as Maulana Amin Ahsan Islahi, Mualana Muhammad Manzoor Naumani, Maulana Abul Hassan Ali Nudvi and Maulana Naeem Siddiqui. Jamaat-e-Islami actively opposed the partition of India, with its leader Maulana Abul A'la Maududi arguing that concept violated the Islamic doctrine of the ummah. The Jamaat-e-Islami saw the partition as creating a temporal border that would divide Muslims from one another. Maududi held that humans should accept God's sovereignty and adopt the divine code, which supersedes manmade laws, terming it a \\"theodemocracy\\", because its rule would be based on the entire Muslim community, not the ulema (Islamic scholars). Maududi migrated to Lahore, which became part of the new state of Pakistan. =After the creation of Pakistan= With the partition of India in 1947, the JI was split to follow the political boundaries of new countries carved out of British India. The organisation headed by Maududi became known as Jamaat-i- Islami Pakistan, and the remnant of JI in India as the Jamaat-e-Islami Hind. Later JI parties were the Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami, and autonomous groups in Indian Kashmir. With the founding of Pakistan, Maududi's career underwent a \\"fundamental change\\", being drawn more and more into politics, and spending less time on ideological and scholarly pursuits. Although his Jamaat-i Islami party never developed a mass following, it and Maududi did develop significant political influence. It played a \\"prominent part\\" in the agitation which brought down President Ayub Khan in 1969 and in the overthrow of Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto in 1977. Maududi and the JI were especially influential in the early years of General Zia ul-Haq's rule. His political activity, particularly in support of the creation of an Islamic state clashed with the government, (dominated for many years by a secular political class), and resulted in several arrests and periods of incarceration. The first was in 1948 when he and several other JI leaders were jailed after Maududi objected to the government's clandestine sponsorship of insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir while professing to observe a ceasefire with India. In 1951 and again in 1956-7, the compromises involved in electoral politics led to a split in the party over what some members felt were a lowering of JI's moral standards. In 1951, the JI shura passed a resolution in support of the party withdrawing from politics, while Maududi argued for continued involvement. Maududi prevailed at an open party meeting in 1951, and several senior JI leaders resigned in protest, further strengthened Maududi's position and beginning the growth of a \\"cult of personality\\" around him.\\" In 1957 Maududi again overruled the vote of the shura to withdraw from electoral politics. In 1953, he and the JI participated in a campaign against the Ahmadiyya Community in Pakistan. Anti-Ahmadi groups argued that the Ahmadiyya did not embrace Muhammad as the last prophet. Maududi as well as the traditionalist ulama of Pakistan wanted Ahmadi designated as non-Muslims, Ahmadis such as Muhammad Zafarullah Khan sacked from all high level government positions, and intermarriage between Ahmadis and other Muslims prohibited. The campaign generated riots in Lahore, leading to the deaths of at least 200 Ahmadis, and selective declaration of martial law. Maududi was arrested by the military deployment headed by Lieutenant General Azam Khan and sentenced to death for his part in the agitation. However, the anti-Ahmadi campaign enjoyed much popular support, and strong public pressure ultimately convinced the government to release him after two years of imprisonment. According to Vali Nasr, Maududi's unapologetic and impassive stance after being sentenced, ignoring advice to ask for clemency, had an \\"immense\\" effect on his supporters. It was seen as a \\"victory of Islam over un-Islam\\", proof of his leadership and staunch faith. In particular, Maududi advocated that the Pakistani state should be in accordance to Quran and sunnah, including in terms of conventional banking and rights to Muslims, minorities, Christians, and other religious sects such as the Ahmadiyya. > An Islamic state is a Muslim state, but a Muslim state may not be an Islamic > state unless and until the Constitution of the state is based on the Qur'an > and Sunnah. The campaign shifted the focus of national politics towards Islamicity. The 1956 Constitution was adopted after accommodating many of the demands of the JI. Maududi endorsed the constitution and claimed it a victory for Islam. However following a coup by General Ayub Khan, the constitution was shelved and Maududi and his party were politically repressed, Maududi being imprisoned in 1964 and again in 1967. The JI joined an opposition alliance with secular parties, compromising with doctrine to support a woman candidate (Fatima Jinnah) for president against Khan in 1965. In the December 1970 general election, Maududi toured the country as a \\"leader in waiting\\" and JI spent considerable energy and resources fielding 151 candidates. Despite this, the party won only four seats in the national assembly and four in the provincial assemblies. The loss led Maududi to withdraw from political activism in 1971 and return to scholarship. In 1972 he resigned as JI's Ameer (leader) for reasons of health. However it was shortly thereafter that Islamism gathered steam in Pakistan in the form of the Nizam-i-Mustafa (Order of the Prophet) movement, an alliance of conservative political groups united against Zulfikar Ali Bhutto which the JI gave shape to and which bolstered its standing. In 1977, Maududi \\"returned to the center stage\\". When Bhutto attempted to defuse tensions on 16 April 1977, he came to Maududi's house for consultations. When General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq overthrew Bhutto and came to power in 1977, he \\"accorded Mawdudi the status of a senior statesman, sought his advice, and allowed his words to adorn the front pages of the newspapers. Maududi proved receptive to Zia's overtures and supported his decision to execute Bhutto.\\" Despite some doctrinal difference (Maududi wanted sharia by education rather than by state fiat: \\"When General Zia ul-Haq enacted his Hudud Ordinances of 1979, this caused difficulties in the Jama'at's alliance with the general's government and led to costly doctrinal compromises by the party.\\" [p. 98] \\"... Maududi again underlined the importance of education in Islam as a prerequisite for the Islamization of society ... This idea was in direct opposition to the \\"Islamzation first\\" approach of General Zia ul-Haq.\\" [p. 104]), Maududi enthusiastically supported Zia and his program of Islamization or \\"Sharization\\". Beliefs and ideology Maududi poured his energy into books, pamphlets and more than 1000 speeches and press statements, laying the ground work for making Pakistan an Islamic state, but also dealing with a variety of issues of interest in Pakistan and the Muslim world. He sought to be a Mujaddid, \\"renewing\\" (tajdid) the religion. This role had great responsibility as he believed a Mujaddid \\"on the whole, has to undertake and perform the same kind of work as is accomplished by a Prophet.\\" While earlier mujaddids had renewed religion he wanted also \\"to propagate true Islam, the absence of which accounted for the failure of earlier efforts at tajdid.\\": \\"He argued that his intent was not only to revive Islam but to propagate true Islam, the absence of which accounted for the failure of earlier efforts at tajdid.\\" Jama'at-i Islami ke untis sal (Lahore: Shu'bah'bah-i Nashr'u Isha'at-i Jama'at-i Islami, 1970), pp. 38‚Äì39 According to at least one biographer (Vali Nasr), Maududi and the JI moved away from some of their more controversial doctrinal ideas (e.g. criticism of Sufism or the Ulama) and closer to orthodox Islam over the course of his career, in order to \\"expand\\"the \\"base of support\\" of Jama'at-e Islami. =Qur'an= Maududi believed that the Quran was not just religious literature to be \\"recited, pondered, or investigated for hidden truths\\" according to Vali Nasr, but a \\"socio-religious institution\\", a work to be accepted \\"at face value\\" and obeyed. By implementing its prescriptions the ills of societies would solved. It pitted truth and bravery against ignorance, falsehood and evil.: \\"The erection of communal boundaries and the search for identity in Mawdudi's works increasingly cast the world in terms of good and evil, converting history into an arena for an apocalyptic battle between the two.\\" > The Qur'an is ... a Book which contains a message, an invitation, which > generates a movement. The moment it began to be sent down, it impelled a > quiet and pious man to ... raise his voice against falsehood, and pitted him > in a grim struggle against the lords of disbelief, evil and iniquity.... it > drew every pure and noble soul, and gathered them under the banner of truth. > In every part of the country, it made all the mischievous and the corrupt to > rise and wage war against the bearers of the truth.1979, Tafhimul Qur'an, > Vol. I, Lahore, p. 334 In his tafsir (Quranic interpretation) Tafhimu'l-Qur'an, he introduced the four interrelated concepts he believed essential to understanding the Quran: ilah (divinity), rabb (lord), 'ibadah (worship, meaning not the cherishing or praising of God but acting out absolute obedience to Him), and din (religion). =Islam= Maududi saw Muslims not simply as those who followed the religion of Islam, but as (almost) everything, because obedience to divine law is what defines a Muslim: \\"Everything in the universe is 'Muslim' for it obeys Allah by submission to His laws.\\" The laws of the physical universe ‚Äì that the heaven is above earth, that night follows day, etc. ‚Äì were as much a part of sharia as banning consumption of alcohol and interest on debts. Thus it followed that stars, planets, oceans, rocks, atoms, etc. should actually be considered \\"Muslims\\" since they obey their creator's laws. Rather than Muslims being a minority among humans‚Äîone religious group among many‚Äîit is non-Muslims who are a small minority among everything in the universe. Of all creatures only humans (and jinn) are endowed with free will, and only non-Muslim humans (and jinn) choose to use that will to disobey the laws of their creator. But in rejecting Islam (Maududi believed) the non-Muslim struggled against truth: > His very tongue which, on account of his ignorance advocates the denial of > God or professes multiple deities, is in its very nature 'Muslim'.... The > man who denies God is called Kafir (concealer) because he conceals by his > disbelief what is inherent in his nature and embalmed in his own soul. His > whole body functions in obedience to that instinct.... Reality becomes > estranged from him and he in the dark. Since a Muslim is one who obeys divine law, simply having made a shahada (declaration of belief in the oneness of God and the acceptance of Muhammad as God's prophet) or being born into a Muslim family does not make you a Muslim.: \\"a Islam, we wrote, was not a birthright, nor a simple proclamation of the shahadah, but the testimony to an individual's absolute obedience to God ‚Äì Islam found meaning only in the context of works.\\" Nor is seeking \\"knowledge of God\\" part of the religion of Islam. The Muslim is a \\"slave of God\\", and \\"absolute obedience to God\\" is a \\"fundamental right\\" of God. The Muslim does \\"not have the right to choose a way of life for himself or assume whatever duties he likes.\\": \\"He wrote: 'You must remember that you are a born slave of God. He has created you for His servitude only'.... He viewed absolute obedience to God as a fundamental right of God.... 'Man ... does not have the right to choose a way of life for himself or assume whatever duties he likes.'\\" Maududi believed that Islam covered all aspects of life. > Islam is not a 'religion' in the sense this term is commonly understood. It > is a system encompassing all fields of living. Islam means politics, > economics, legislation, science, humanism, health, psychology and sociology. > It is a system which makes no discrimination on the basis of race, color, > language or other external categories. Its appeal is to all mankind. It > wants to reach the heart of every human being.\\"Sayyid Abul Ala Mawdudi, > Towards Understanding the Quran, Chapter 7, Lahore, Pakistan. Of all these aspects of Islam, Maududi was primarily interested in culture‚Äîpreserving Islamic dress, language and customs, from (what he believed were) the dangers of women's emancipation, secularism, nationalism, etc. It was also important to separate the realm of Islam from non-Islam‚Äîto form \\"boundaries\\" around Islam.: \\"This redefinition of Islam began with erecting impregnable boundaries around the religion, a necessary first step in constructing an Islamic ideology.... The lines of demarcation that defined Islam were perforce steadfast: there was either Islam, as it was understood and defined by Mawdudi, or there was un-Islam.\\"Maududi, Towards Understanding Islam pp. 4, 11‚Äì12, 18‚Äì19,Maududi, Let Us Be Muslims, pp. 53‚Äì55 It would also be proven scientifically (Maududi believed) that Islam would \\"eventually ... emerge as the World-Religion to cure Man of all his maladies.\\"Sayyid Abu'l-A'la Maududi, A Short History of the Revivalist Movement in Islam, reprint (Lahore: Islamic Publications, 1963), p. iii: \\"[he would] scientifically prove that Islam is eventually to emerge as the World-Religion to cure Man of all his maladies.\\" But what many Muslims, including many Ulama, considered Islam, Maududi did not. Maudid complained that \\"not more than 0.001%\\" of Muslim knew what Islam actually was.Sayyid Abu'l-A'la Mawdudi, Tahrik-i axadi Hind awr Musalman (Lahore, 1973), 2:140 Maududi not only idealized the first years of Muslim society (Muhammad and the \\"rightly guided\\" Caliphs), but considered what came after to be un-Islamic or jahiliya‚Äîwith the exception of brief religious revivals.: \\"He regarded Islamic history from the end of the rightly guided caliphs onward as essentially a period of decline and of jahiliyah. Except for periodic surges of orthodoxy in the guise of revivalist movements, Muslim life had been defiled by syncretic concessions to heathen tendencies ...\\" Muslim philosophy, literature, arts, mysticism were syncretic and impure, diverting attention from the divine.: \\"Although traditional divines idealized the early history of Islam, they did not view what followed that era to be \\"un-Islamic\\", ...Maududi did not view Islamic history as the history of Islam but as the history of un-Islam or jahiliyah. Islamic history as the product of human choice, was corruptible and corrupted.\\" Hadith Maududi had a unique perspective on the transmission of hadith‚Äîthe doings and sayings of the Islamic prophet Muhammad that were passed on orally before being written down, and which form most of the basis of Islamic law. The authenticity and \\"quality\\" of hadith are traditionally left to the judgments of \\"generations of muhaddithin\\" (hadith scholars) who base their decisions on factors like the number of chains of oral transmission (known as isnad) passing down the text of the hadith (matn) and reliability of the transmitters/narrators passing down the hadith in the chain. But Maududi believed that \\"with extensive study and practice one can develop a power and can intuitively sense the wishes and desires of the Holy Prophet\\", and that he had that intuitive ability. \\"Thus ... on seeing a Hadith, I can tell whether the Holy Prophet could or could not have said it.\\"Maududi, S.A.A., Tafhimat (Lahore, 1965) 1:202, quoted in Maududi also disagreed with many traditional/conservative Muslims in arguing that evaluating hadith, traditional hadith scholars had ignored the importance of the matn (content) in favor of the isnad (chain of transmission of the hadith).Maududi, Abul A'la, Tafhimat (16th edition, Lahore, 1989), 356; quoted in Maududi also broke with traditional doctrine by raising the question of the reliability of companions of the prophet as transmitters of hadith, saying \\"even the noble Companions were overcome by human weaknesses, one attacking another\\".Maud≈´dƒ´, Ab≈´ al- øAlƒÅ, Tafhƒ´mƒÅt, 16th edition, Lahore, 1989, 359; quoted in Sunnah Maududi wrote a number of essays on the SunnahD.W. Brown, Rethinking tradition in modern Islamic thought, 1996: p.77-80‚Äîthe customs and practices of Muhammad‚Äîand sought a middle way between the belief of conservative Islamists that the sunnah of the prophet should be obeyed in every aspect, and the traditions that tells us that Muhammad made mistakes,D.W. Brown, Rethinking tradition in Modern Islamic Thought, 1996: p. 79 and was not always obeyed by his followers (Zayd divorced his wife against the wishes of Muhammad).mistakes D.W. Brown, Rethinking tradition in modern Islamic thought, 1996: p. 78 Mawdudi argued that mistakes by Muhammad corrected by God mentioned in the Quran should be thought of not as an indication of Muhammad's human frailty but of how God monitored his behavior and corrected even his smallest errors. Mawdudi concluded that in theory (na·∫ìarƒ´) the Prophet's prophetic and personal capacities are separate and distinct, but in practice ( øamalƒ´) it is \\"neither practical nor permissible\\" for mortals to decide for themselves which is which, and so Muslims should not disregard any aspect of the sunnah. =Women= According to Irfan Ahmad, while Maududi opposed all Western influence in Islam, \\"the greatest threat to morality\\" to him was \\"women's visibility\\" in the bazaar, colleges, theatres, restaurants. \\"Art, literature, music, film, dance, use of makeup by women: all were shrieking signs of immorality\\". Maududi preached that the duty of women is to manage the household, bring up children and provide them and her husband with \\"the greatest possible comfort and contentment\\". Maududi supported the complete veiling and segregation of women as practiced in most of Muslim India of his time. Women, he believed, should remain in their homes except when absolutely necessary. The only room for argument he saw in the matter of veiling/hijab was \\"whether the hands and the face\\" of women \\"were to be covered or left uncovered.\\"Maududi, Purdah and the Status of Woman in Islam, (Lahore, 1979), p. 20 On this question Maududi came down on the side of the complete covering of women's faces whenever they left their homes. Concerning the separation of the genders, he preached that men should avoid looking at women other than their wives, mothers, sisters, etc. (mahram), much less trying to make their acquaintance. He opposed birth control and family planning as a \\"rebellion against the laws of nature\\",Maududi, Birth Control, (Lahore, 1978), p. 73 and a reflection of loss of faith in God‚Äîwho is the planner of human populationMaududi, Islam and Birth Control (Urdu), 1962. pp. 104‚Äì130, 150‚Äì53‚Äîand unnecessary because population growth leads to economic development. Mohammad Najatuallah Siddiqui writes, > As to the argument that family planning enables better nourishment and > education of children, Mawdudi refers to the beneficial effects of adversity > and want on human character.Siddiqi, Mohammad Nejatullah, Muslim Economic > Thinking: A Survey of Contemporary Literature, The Islamic Foundation, > Leicester, 2007, p. 41Maududi, Islam and Birth Control (Urdu), 1962. p. 132 Maududi opposed allowing women to be either a head of state or a legislator, since \\"according to Islam, active politics and administration are not the field of activity of the womenfolk.\\" They would be allowed to elect their own all-woman legislature which the men's legislature should consult on all matters concerning women's welfare. Their legislature would also have \\"the full right to criticize matters relating to the general welfare of the country,\\" though not to vote on them.Maududi, Islamic Law and Constitution, 1977: p. 308 =Music= Maududi saw music and dancing as social evils. In describing the wickedness that comes of ignoring Islamic law he included not only leaving the poor to \\"starvation and destitution\\" while wallowing in luxury, liquor and drugs, but having \\"a regular need\\" for music, satisfied with \\"musicians, dancing girls, drum-beaters and manufacturers of musical instruments\\". =Economics= His 1941 lecture \\"The economic problem of man and its Islamic solution\\" is \\"generally considered to be \\"one of the founding document of modern Islamic economics.Kuran, Islam and Mammon, 2004: pp. 84-6Khan, Islamic Banking in Pakistan, 2015: p. 57 Maududi has been called the leader of the \\"vanguard of contemporary Islamic orthodoxy\\" in \\"riba and finance.\\"Khan, Islamic Banking in Pakistan, 2015: p. 2 and credited with laying \\"down the foundations for development\\" of Islamic economics. However, Maududi believed Islam \\"does not concern itself with the modes of production and circulation of wealth\\",Maududi, Economic System of Islam, n.d.: p. 1 and was primarily interested in cultural issues rather than socioeconomic ones. Maududi dismissed the need for a \\"new science of economics, embodied in voluminous books, with high-sounding terminology and large organisation\\",Maududi, Economic System of Islam, n.d.: p.8-9 or other \\"experts and specialists\\" which he believed to be \\"one of the many calamities of modern age\\".Maududi, Economic System of Islam, n.d.: p. 10 One of the major fallacies of economics was that it regarded \\"as foolish and morally reprehensible\\" spending \\"all that one earns, and everyone is told that he should save something out of his income and have his savings deposited in the bank or purchase an insurance policy or invest it in stocks and shares of joint-stock companies.\\" In fact, the practice of saving and not spending some income is \\"ruinous for humanity\\".Maududi, Economic System of Islam, n.d.: p. 24 But since Islam was a complete system, it included (a shariah-based) economic program, comparable and (of course) superior to other economic systems. Capitalism was a \\"satanic economic system\\" starting with the fact that it called for the postponement of some consumption in favor of investment. This led to overproduction and a downward spiral of lower wages, protectionism, trade wars and desperate attempts to export surplus production and capital through imperialist invasions of other countries,Maududi, Economic System of Islam, n.d.: p.21-3 finally ending in \\"the destruction of the whole society as every learned economist knows\\". On the other hand, socialism ‚Äî by putting control of the means and distribution of production in the hands of the government ‚Äì concentrates power to such an extent it inevitably leads to enslavement of the masses.Maududi, Economic System of Islam, n.d.: p.25-8 Socialists sought to end economic exploitation and poverty by structural changes and putting an end to private ownership of production and property. But in fact poverty and exploitation is caused not by the profit motive but by the lack of \\"virtue and public welfare\\" among the wealthy, which in turn comes from a lack of adherence to sharia law. In an Islamic society, greed, selfishness and dishonesty would be replaced by virtue, eliminating the need for the state to make any significant intervention in the economy. According to Maududi, this system would strike a \\"golden mean\\" between the two extremes of laisse faire capitalism and a regimented socialist/communist society,Maududi, Economic System of Islam, n.d.: p. 5 embodying all of the virtues and none of the vices of the two inferior systems. It would not be some kind of mixed economy/social democratic compromise, because by following Islamic law and banning alcohol, pork, adultery, music, dancing, interest on loans, gambling, speculation, fraud, and \\"other similar things\\",Maududi, Economic System of Islam, n.d.: p. 30 it would be distinct and superior to all other systems. Before the economy (like the government, and other parts of society) could be Islamized, an Islamic revolution-through-education would have to take place to develop this virtue and create support for total sharia law. This put Maududi at a political disadvantage with populist and socialist programs because his solution was \\"neither immediate nor tangible\\".  Banning interest  Of all the elements of Islamic laws dealing with property and money (payment of zakat and other Islamic taxes, etc.), Maududi emphasized the elimination of interest on loans (riba). (According to one scholar, this was because in British India Hindus dominated the money lending trade.) Maududi opposed any and all interest on loans as unIslamic riba. He taught that there > is hardly a country of the world in which moneylenders and banks are not > sucking the blood of poor labouring classes, farmers and low income groups > ... A major portion of the earning of a working man is expropriated by the > moneylenders, leaving the poor man with hardly enough money to feed himself > and his family.Maududi, Economic System of Islam, n.d.: p. 192 While the Quran forbid many sins, it saved its \\"severest terms\\" of punishment ‚Äì according to Maududi ‚Äì for use of interest. He believed there was no such thing as a low \\"reasonable rate of interest\\"Maududi, Economic System of Islam, n.d.: pp. 178‚Äì9 and that even \\"the smallest and apparently harmless form\\"Maududi, Economic System of Islam, n.d.: p. 166 of interest was intolerable in Islam as rates would inevitably increased over time when the \\"capitalists\\" (moneylenders) squeezed the entrepreneurs (borrowers) eliminating any entrepreneurial profit.Maududi, Economic System of Islam, n.d.: p. 181Khan, Islamic Banking in Pakistan, 2015: p. 63 To replace interest-based finance he proposed \\"direct equity investment\\" (aka Profit and loss sharing), which he asserted would favor \\"societally profitable\\" ventures such as low-income housing that conventional finance ignores in favour of commercially profitable ones.Maududi, Economic System of Islam, n.d.: p. 188 To eliminate the charging of interest he proposed penal punishment with the death penalty for repeat offenders.Maududi, Economic System of Islam, n.d.: p. 199Khan, Islamic Banking in Pakistan, 2015: p. 65 Critics (Feisal Khan) complain that Maududi had no training as an economist and his description of interest-based finance resembles that of the dynamic between South Asian peasant and village moneylender rather than between modern conventional bank and borrower; and furthermore Khan argues that Maududi gives no explanation why direct equity finance would lead to any more investment than interest- based lending has in what is good for society but not commercially profitable for financiers.Khan, Islamic Banking in Pakistan, 2015: p. 64 Socialism and populism Unlike Islamists such as Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Maududi had a visceral antipathy to socialism, which he spent much time denouncing as \\"godless\\" as well as being unnecessary and redundant in the face of the Islamic state. A staunch defender of the rights of property, he warned workers and peasants that \\"you must never take the exaggerated view of your rights which the protagonists of class war present before you.\\"From the text of lecture at a Labour Committee convention in 1957; reprinted in Mawdudi, Economic System of Islam, (1984) p. 284 He also did not believe in intervention in the economy to provide universal employment. > Islam does not make it binding on society to provide employment for each and > every one of its citizens, since this responsibility cannot be accepted > without thorough nationalisation of the country's resources.Maududi, Sayyid > Abul-A'la, Capitalism, Socialism and Islam, (Lahore, 1977), p. 65 Maududi held to this position despite his florid denunciations of how the rich were \\"sucking the blood\\" and enslavingMaududi, Economic System of Islam, n.d.: p. 23 the poor, the popularity of populism among many Pakistanis, and despite the poverty and vast gap between rich and poor in Pakistan (a situation often described a \\"feudal\\" (jagirdari) in its large landholdings and rural poverty). Maududi openly opposed land reform proposals for Punjab by Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan in the 1950s, going so far as to justify feudalism by pointing to Islam's protection of property rights. He later softened his views, extolling economic justice and equity (but not egalitarianism), but cautioned the government against tampering with \\"lawful Jagirdari\\", and continuing to emphasize the sanctity of private property. =Islamic Modernism= Maududi believed that Islam supported modernization but not Westernization.: \\"[Islam] says \\"yes\\" to modernization but \\"no\\" to blind Westernisation.\\" He agreed with Islamic Modernists that Islam contained nothing contrary to reason, and that it was superior in rational terms to all other religious systems. He disagreed with their practice of examining the Quran and the Sunnah using reason as the standard, instead of starting from the proposition that \\"true reason is Islamic\\" and accepting the Book and the Sunnah, rather than reason, as the final authority. He also took a narrow view of ijtihad, limiting the authority to use it to those with thorough grounding in Islamic sciences, faith in the sharia, and then only to serve the needs of his vision of an Islamic state. At the same time, one scholar, Maryam Jameelah, has noted the extensive use of modern, non-traditionally Islamic ideas and \\"Western idioms and concepts\\" in Maududi's thought. > Islam was a \\"revolutionary ideology\\" and a \\"dynamic movement\\", the Jama'at- > e-Islami, was a \\"party\\", the Shari'ah a complete \\"code\\" in Islam's \\"total > scheme of life.\\" His enthusiasm for [Western idioms and concepts] was > infectious among those who admired him, encouraging them to implement in > Pakistan all his \\"manifestos\\", \\"programmes\\" and \\"schemes'\\", to usher in a > true Islamic \\"renaissance\\". =Mughal Empire= Abul A'la Maududi, condemned Mughal Emperor Akbar's belief in an individual's common spirituality (controversially known as the Din-e Ilahi, or \\"Religion of God\\") as a form of apostasy. (Contemporary scholars such as S. M. Ikram argue that Akbar's true intentions were to create an iradat or muridi (discipleship) and not a new religion. Maududi appears to be a critic of not only Western Civilization but also of the Mughal Empire, many of whose achievements he deemed \\"Unislamic\\". =Secularism= Maududi did not see secularism as a way for the state/government to dampen tensions and divisions in multi-religious societies by remaining religiously neutral and avoid choosing sides. Rather, he believed, it removed religion from society (he translated secularism into Urdu as la din, literally \\"religionless\\"Adams, Charles J., \\"Mawdudi and the Islamic State,\\" in John L. Esposito, ed., Voices of Resurgent Islam, (New York: Oxford University Press, 1983), p. 103). Since (he believed) all morality came from religion, this would necessarily mean \\"the exclusion of all morality, ethics, or human decency from the controlling mechanisms of society.\\"Adams, Charles J., \\"Mawdudi and the Islamic State,\\" in John L. Esposito, ed., Voices of Resurgent Islam, (New York: Oxford University Press, 1983), p. 113 It was to avoid the \\"restraints of morality and divine guidance\\", and not out of pragmatism or some higher motive, that some espoused secularism. =Science= Maududi believed \\"modern science was a 'body' that could accommodate any 'spirit'‚Äîphilosophy or value system‚Äîjust as radio could broadcast Islamic or Western messages with equal facility.\\": \\"modern science was a 'body' that could accommodate any 'spirit' ‚Äì philosophy or value system ‚Äì just as radio could broadcast Islami or Western messages with equal facility.\\" =Nationalism= Maududi strongly opposed the concept of nationalism, believing it to be shirk (polytheism),Maududi, Nationalism in India, 1947, pp 48‚Äì9 and \\"a Western concept which divided the Muslim world and thus prolonged the supremacy of Western imperialist powers\\".Political Islam in the Indian Subcontinent by Frederic Grare BOOK REVIEW Anatomy of Islamism South Asia Asia Times After Pakistan was formed, Maududi and the JI forbade Pakistanis to take an oath of allegiance to the state until it became Islamic, arguing that a Muslim could in clear conscience render allegiance only to God. =Ulama= Maududi also criticized traditionalist clergy or ulama for their \\"moribund\\" scholastic style, \\"servile\\" political attitudes, and \\"ignorance\\" of the modern world\\". He believed traditional scholars were unable to distinguish the fundamentals of Islam from the details of its application, built up in elaborate structures of medieval legal schools of fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence). To rid Islam of these obscure laws Muslims should return to the Quran and Sunna, ignoring judgments made after the reign of the first four \\"rightfully guided\\" caliphs (al-KhulafƒÅ æu ar-RƒÅshid≈´n) of Islam. Maududi also believed there would be little need for the traditional roll of ulama as \\"leaders, judges, and guardians of the community\\", in a \\"reformed and rationalized Islamic order\\" where those trained in modern as well as traditional subjects would practice ijtihad and where Muslims were educated properly in Arabic, the Quran, Hadith, etc. However, over time Maududi became more orthodox in his attitudes, including toward the ulama, and at times allied himself and his party with them after the formation of Pakistan. =Sufism and popular Islam= Like other contemporary revivalists, Maududi was critical of Sufism and its historical influence in the early days.: \\"... he held Sufism accountable for causing the decline of Islam throughout history, referring to it as chuniya begum (lady opium). He believed that Sufism had misled Mughal rulers like Emperor Akbar and his son Dara Shukuh into gravitating toward syncretic experiments.\\" But he also went on record denying any antagonism toward Sufism by himself or the Jama'at.This happened in 1951, (source: Tarjumanu'l-Qur'an, September 1951, pp. 55‚Äì6, and November 1951, pp. 34‚Äì36) (According to at least one biographer, this change in position was a result of the importance of Sufism in Pakistan not only among the Muslim masses but the ulama as well.): \\"... Sufism was of great importance to the major ulama groups in Pakistan, the Deobandis and the Barelvis, and they found Mawdudi's attacks on Sufism just as contentious as his exegeses on juridical and theological matters.. In Punjab and Sind, Sufism played an important role in the popular culture of the masses and eventually in their politics.\\" At that time, Maududi distinguished between the Sufism of Shaikhs like 'Alau'ddin Shah (which he approved of) and the shrines, festivals, and rituals of popular Sufism (which he did not). He also \\"redefined\\" Sufism, describing it not in the traditional sense as the form and spirit of an \\"esoteric dimension\\" of Islam, but as the way to measure \\"concentration\\" and \\"morals\\" in religion, saying: \\"For example, when we say our prayers, Fiqh will judge us only by fulfillment of the outward requirements such as ablution, facing toward the Ka'ba ... while Tasawwuf (Sufism) will judge our prayers by our concentration ... the effect of our prayers on our morals and manners.\\"Maududi, S.A.A., Towards Understanding Islam, (Indianapolis, 1977), p. 111 From the mid-1960s onward, \\"redefinition\\" of Islam \\"increasingly gave way to outright recognition of Sufism,\\" and after Maududi's death the JI amir Qazi Hussain Ahmad went so far as to visit the Sufi Data Durbar shrine in Lahore in 1987 as part of a tour to generate mass support for JI. =Sharia= Maududi believed that sharia was not just a crucial command that helped define what it meant to be a Muslim, but something without which a Muslim society could not be Islamic: > That if an Islamic society consciously resolves not to accept the sharia, > and decides to enact its own constitution and laws or borrow them from any > other source in disregard of the sharia, such a society breaks its contract > with God and forfeits its right to be called 'Islamic.'\\"Maududi, S. Abul > A'la, Islamic Law and Its Introduction, Islamic Publications, LTD, 1955, pp. > 13‚Äì4. Many unbelievers agreed that God was the creator, what made them unbelievers was their failure to submit to his will, i.e. to God's law. Obedience to God's law or will was \\"the historical controversy that Islam has awakened\\" throughout the world. It brought not only heavenly reward, but earthly blessing. Failure to obey, or \\"rebellion\\" against it, brought not only eternal punishment, but evil and misery here on earth. The source of sharia, was to be found not only in the Quran but also in the Sunnah (the doings and sayings of the Islamic prophet Muhammad), since the Quran proclaimed \\"Whoever obeys the messenger [i.e. Muhammad] obeys Allah.\\" Sharia was perhaps most famous for calling for the abolition of interest-bearing banks, hadd penalties such as flogging and amputation for alcohol consumption, theft, fornication, adultery and other crimes. Hadd penalties have been criticized by Westernized Muslims as cruel and in violation of international human rights but Maududi argued that any cruelty was far outweighed by the cruelty in the West that resulted from the absence of these punishments,Maududi, S. Abul A'la, Human Rights in Islam, Islamic Foundation, 1976, pp. 31‚Äì32Maududi, S. Abul A'la, Islamic Law and Its Introduction, Islamic Publications, LTD, 1955, p. 67 and in any case would not be applied until Muslims fully understood the teachings of their faith and lived in an Islamic state. But in fact sharia was much more than these laws. It recognizes no division between religion and other aspects of life, in Maududi's view,Maududi, Islamic Law and Constitution, 1977: p. 165 and there was no area of human activity or concern which the sharia did not address with specific divine guidance. > Family relationships, social and economic affairs, administration, rights > and duties of citizens, judicial system, laws of war and peace and > international relations. In short it embraces all the various departments of > life ... The sharia is a complete scheme of life and an all-embracing social > order where nothing is superfluous and nothing lacking.Mawdudi, Islamic Law, > p. 57 quoted in Adams p. 113 A \\"very large part\\" of sharia required \\"the coercive power and authority of the state\\" for its enforcement. Consequently, while a state based on Islam has a legislature which the ruler must consult, its function \\"is really that of law-finding, not of law-making.\\"Mawdudi, Islamic Law, p. 77 quoted in Adams p. 125 At the same time, Maududi states (\\"somewhat astonishingly\\" according to one scholar) \\"there is yet another vast range of human affairs about which sharia is totally silent\\" and which an Islamic state may write \\"independent\\" legislation. According to scholar Vali Nasr, Maududi believed that the sharia needed to be \\"streamlined, reinterpreted, and expanded\\" to \\"address questions of governance to the extent required for a state to function.\\" For example, sharia needed to \\"make clear the relation between the various branches of government\\". =Islamic Revolution= Though the phrase \\"Islamic Revolution\\" is commonly associated with the 1979 Iranian Revolution, (or General Zia's Islamisation), Maududi coined and popularized it in the 1940s. The process Maududi envisioned‚Äîchanging the hearts and minds of individuals from the top of society downward through an educational process or da'wah‚Äîwas very different than what happened in Iran, or under Zia ul-Haq. Maududi talked of Islam being \\"a revolutionary ideology and a revolutionary practice which aims at destroying the social order of the world totally and rebuilding it from scratch\\",Maududi, The Process of Islamic Revolution but opposed sudden change, violent or unconstitutional action, and was uninterested in grassroots organizing or socio-economic changes. His \\"revolution\\" would be achieved \\"step-by-step\\"Short Proceedings of the 2nd Annual Conference, Jamaat-e-Islami, East Pakistan, (Dacca, 1958), p 8; enclosed with U.S. Consulate, Dacca, Dispatch no.247, 3 April 1958, 790D.00/4-358, United States National Archives. with \\"patience\\", since \\"the more sudden a change, the more short-lived it is.\\"Mawdudi, Sayyid Abu'l-A'la, Islamic Law and Constitution, (Karachi, 1955), p. 48 He warned against the emotionalism of \\"demonstrations or agitations, ... flag waving, slogans ... impassioned speeches ... or the like\\",Rudad-i Jama'at-i Islami, 1:49‚Äì50 [proceedings of various Jama'at congresses between 1941 and 1955] He believed that \\"societies are built, structured, and controlled from the top down by conscious manipulation of those in power,\\" not by grassroots movements. The revolution would be carried out by training a cadre of pious and dedicated men who would lead and then protect the Islamic revolutionary process. To facilitate this far-reaching program of cultural change, his party \\"invested heavily\\" in producing and disseminating publications. Maududi was committed to non-violent legal politics \\"even if the current methods of struggle takes a century to bear fruit.\\" In 1957 he outlined a new Jama'at policy declaring that \\"transformation of the political order through unconstitutional means\\" was against sharia law.Sayyid Abu'l-A'la Mawdudi, Tahrik-i Islami ka a\`indah la\`ihah-i 'amal, Lahore, 1986, p. 205 Even when he and his party were repressed by the Ayub Khan or People's Party (in 1972) governments, Maududi kept his party from clandestine activity. It was not until he retired as emir of JI that JI and Jam'iat-e Tulabah \\"became more routinely involved in violence.\\" The objective of the revolution was to be justice (adl) and benevolence (ihsan), but the injustice and wrong to be overcome that he focused on was immorality (fahsha) and forbidden behavior (munkarat). Maududi was interested in ethical changes, rather than socio- economic changes of the sort that drive most historical revolutions and revolutionary movements. He did not support these (for example, opposing land reform in the 1950s as an encroachment on property rights) and believed the problems they addressed would be solved by the Islamic state established by the revolution. All this left at least one commentator, (Vali Nasr), to wonder if Maudidi had any actual interest in \\"revolution\\" (or \\"ideology\\"), or saw them simply as buzzwords necessary to indicate commitment to \\"progress, justice, and political idealism\\" in the anti-colonialist political milieu of 20th century South Asia.: \\"In Mawdudi's conception, revolution and its corollary, ideology, had no class reference. They simply permitted Mawdudi to equip the Jama'at with a repertoire of terms that allowed the party to stand its ground in debates over what constituted progress, justice, and political idealism.\\" =Islamic state= The modern conceptualization of the \\"Islamic state\\" is also attributed to Maududi. This term was coined and popularized in his book, The Islamic Law and Constitution (1941),Maududi, Islamic Law and Constitution, 1977: p. v and in subsequent writings. Maududi's Islamic state is both ideological and all-embracing, based on \\"Islamic Democracy,\\"Abu al-A'la al-Mawdudi, \\"Political Theory of Islam,\\" in Khurshid Ahmad, ed., Islam: Its Meaning and Message (London: Islamic Council of Europe, 1976), pp. 159‚Äì61. and will eventually \\"rule the earth\\". In 1955 he described it as a \\"God-worshipping democratic Caliphate, founded on the guidance vouchsafed to us through Muhammad.\\"Sayyid Abu'l-A'la Mawdudi, The Message of Jam'at-i- Islami, (Lahore, 1955), p. 46(Nasr speaking) Ultimately though, Islam was more important and the state would be judged by its adherence to din (religion and the Islamic system) and not democracy. Unlike the Islamic state of Ayatollah Khomeini, it would not establish and enforce Islamisation, but follow the Islamisation of society. As Maududi became involved in politics, this vision was \\"relegated to a distant utopia\\". Three principles underlying it: tawhid (oneness of God), risala (prophethood) and khilafa (caliphate).Abu al-A'la al-Mawdudi, Islamic Way of Life (Delhi: Markazi Maktaba Islami, 1967), p. 40Esposito and Piscatory, \\"Democratization and Islam,\\" pp. 436‚Äì7, 440.Esposito, The Islamic Threat, pp. 125‚Äì6Voll and Esposito, Islam and Democracy, pp. 23‚Äì6. The \\"sphere of activity\\" covered by the Islamic state would be \\"co-extensive with human life ... In such a state no one can regard any field of his affairs as personal and private.\\"Mawdudi, Islamic Law, p. 154 The Islamic state recognizes the sovereignty of God, which meant God was the source of all law. The Islamic state acts as the vicegerent or agent of God on earth and enforces Islamic law, which as mentioned above is both all-embracing and \\"totally silent\\" on a \\"vast range of human affairs\\". While the government follows the sharia law, when it comes to a question about which no explicit injunction is to be found in the sharia, the matter is \\"settled by consensus among the Muslims.\\"Maududi, Islamic Law and Constitution, 1977: p. 148 The state can be called a caliphate, but the \\"caliph\\" would not be the traditional descendant of the Quraysh tribe but (Maududi believed) the entire Muslim community, a \\"popular vicegerency\\". (Although there would also be an individual leader chosen by the Muslim community.) Thus the state would be not a \\"theocracy\\", but a \\"theodemocracy\\". Maududi believed that the sovereignty of God (hakimiya) and the sovereignty of the people are mutually exclusive.Abu al-A'la al-Mawdudi, \\"Political Theory of Islam,\\" in John J. Donahue and John L. Esposito, eds., Islam in Transition: Muslim Perspective, (New York: Oxford University Press, 1982), p. 253. Sovereignty of human beings is simply the domination of man by man, the source of most human misery and calamity. Governance based on sovereignty other than that of God's does not just lead to inferior governance and \\"injustice and maladministration\\", but \\"evil.\\" Therefore, while Maududi used the term democracy to describe his state, (in part to appeal to Westernized Muslim intellectuals),: \\"Because Maududi was compelled to directly address the question of the nature of authority in the Islamic state if he was to win Westernized intellectuals over, he used democracy to deal with their concerns.\\" his \\"Islamic democracy\\" was to be the antithesis of secular Western democracy which transfers hakimiya (God's sovereignty) to the people,Abu al-A'la al-Mawdudi, Political Theory of Islam (Lahore: Islamic Publications, 1976), pp. 13, 15‚Äì7, 38, 75‚Äì82. who may pass laws without regard for God's commands. The Islamic state would conduct its affairs by mutual consultation (shura) among all Muslims. The means of consultation should suit the conditions of the particular time and place but must be free and impartial. While the government follows the sharia law, when it comes to a question about which no explicit injunction is to be found in the sharia, the matter is \\"settled by consensus among the Muslims.\\" Maududi favored giving the state exclusive right to the power of declaring jihad and ijtihad (establishing an Islamic law through \\"independent reasoning\\"), traditionally the domain of the ulama. ;Rights While no aspect of life was to be considered \\"personal and private\\" and the danger of foreign influence and conspiracies was ever present, (nationalism, for example, was \\"a Western concept which divided the Muslim world and thus prolonged the supremacy of Western imperialist powers\\"), there would also be personal freedom and no suspicion of government. Maududi's time spent in jail as a political prisoner led him to have a personal interest in individual rights, due process of law, and freedom of political expression. Maududi stated: > This espionage on the life of the individual cannot be justified on moral > grounds by the government saying that it is necessary to know the secrets of > the dangerous persons.... This is exactly what Islam has called as the root > cause of mischief in politics. The injunction of the Prophet is: \\"When the > ruler begins to search for the causes of dissatisfaction amongst his people, > he spoils them\\" (Abu Dawud).Maududi,Human Rights in Islam, p. 11 However, the basic human right in Islamic law was to demand an Islamic order and to live in it. Not included were any rights to differ with its rulers and defy its authority. ;Islamic Constitution According to Maududi, Islam had an \\"unwritten constitution\\" that needed \\"to be transformed into a written one\\".Maududi, First Principles, p. 1 The constitution would not be the sharia (or the Quran, as Saudi Arabia's constitution is alleged to be) but a religious document based on \\"conventions\\" of the \\"rightly guided caliphs\\", and the \\"canonized verdicts of recognized jurists\\" (i.e. the sharia) as well as the Quran and hadith. ;Model of government In expanding on what the government of an Islamic state should look like in his book The Islamic Law and Constitution, Maududi took as his model the government of Muhammad and the first four caliphs (al-KhulafƒÅ æu ar-RƒÅshid≈´n). The head of state should be the supreme head of legislature, executive and judiciary alike, but under him these three organs should function \\"separately and independently of one another.\\" This head of state should be elected and must enjoy the country's confidence, but he is not limited to terms in office.Maududi, Islamic Law and Constitution, 1977: p. 211 No one is allowed to nominate him for the office, nor to engage in electioneering or run for office, according to another source. Because \\"more than one correct position\\" could not exist, \\"pluralism\\", i.e. competition between political views/parties, would not be allowed,cited in Jasarat, 28 October 1978, pp. 1, 9, Muhammad Mujeed characterized Mawdudi's program as naive: see Mujeeb, Muhammad, The Indian Muslims, (London, 1967), p. 403 and there would be only one party. On the other hand, Maududi believed the state had no need to govern in the Western sense of the term, since the government and citizenry would abide by the same \\"infallible and inviolable divine law\\", power would not corrupt and no one would feel oppressed. Power and resources would be distributed fairly. There would be no grievances, no mass mobilizations, demands for political participation, or any other of the turmoil of non-Islamic governance. Since the prophet had told early Muslims \\"My community will never agree on an error\\", there was no need for establishing concrete procedures and mechanisms for popular consultation.M. Bernard, \\"Idjma\\" in Encyclopedia of Islam Since the state would be defined by its ideology‚Äînot by boundaries or ethnicity‚Äîits raison d'etre and protector would be ideology, the purity of which must be protected against any efforts to subvert it. Naturally it must be controlled and run exclusively by Muslims, and not just any Muslims but only \\"those who believe in the ideology on which it is based and in the Divine Law which it is assigned to administer\\".Mawdudi, Islamic Law, p. 155 The state's legislature \\"should consist of a body of such learned men who have the ability and the capacity to interpret Quranic injunctions and who in giving decisions, would not take liberties with the spirit or the letter of the sharia\\". Their legislation would be based on the practice of ijtihad (a source of Islamic law, relying on careful analogical reasoning, using both the Qu'ran and Hadith, to find a solution to a legal problem), making it more a legal organ than a political one. They must also be \\"persons who enjoy the confidence of the masses\\". They may be chosen by \\"the modern system of elections\\", or by some other method which is appropriate to \\"the circumstances and needs of modern times.\\" Since upright character is essential for office holders and desire for office represents greed and ambition, anyone actively seeking an office of leadership would be automatically disqualified. Non-Muslims or women may not be a head of state but could vote for separate legislators. Originally Maududi envisioned a legislature only as a consultative body, but later proposed using a referendum to deal with possible conflicts between the head of state and the legislature, with the loser of the referendum resigning.Maududi, Islamic Law and Constitution, 1977: p.211-32 Another later rule was allowing the formation of parties and factions during elections of representatives but not within the legislature. In the judiciary, Maududi originally proposed the inquisitional system where judges implement law without discussion or interference by lawyers, which he saw as un-Islamic. After his party was \\"rescued\\" from government repression by the Pakistani judiciary he changed his mind, supporting autonomy of the judiciary and accepting the adversarial system and right of appeal.: \\"In the beginning, Mawdudi had rejected both the adversarial system and the tole of lawyers as immoral and un-Islamic, arguing that Islam accepted only an inquisitional system in which the judge was the final authority ... without discussion or the interference of lawyers ... Then in 1948, 1953, and again in 1963, when the Pakistan government tried to crush the Jama'at, it had been the judiciary that rescued the party. Mawdudui and the Jama'at consequently favored the autonomy of the Pakistani judiciary and accepted the adversarial system and the right to appeal as beneficial ...\\" \\"Failure\\" of Western democracy Secular Western representative democracy‚Äîdespite its free elections and civil rights‚Äîis a failure (Maududi believed) for two reasons. Because secular society has \\"divorced\\" politics and religion (Maududi believed), its leaders have \\"ceased to attach much or any importance to morality and ethics\\" and so ignore their constituents' interests and the common good. Furthermore, without Islam \\"the common people are incapable of perceiving their own true interests\\". An example being the Prohibition law in the United States, where despite the fact that (Maududi states) \\"it had been rationally and logically established that drinking is injurious to health, produces deleterious disorder in human society\\", the law banning alcohol consumption was repealed by the American Congress. =Non- Muslims= Maududi believed that copying cultural practices of non-Muslims was forbidden in Islam, having > very disastrous consequences upon a nation; it destroys its inner vitality, > blurs its vision, befogs its critical faculties, breeds inferiority > complexes, and gradually but assuredly saps all the springs of culture and > sounds its death-knell. That is why the Holy Prophet has positively and > forcefully forbidden the Muslims to assume the culture and mode of life of > the non-Muslims.Maududi, Towards Understanding Islam, p. 131 He was appalled at (what he saw as) the > satanic flood of female liberty and licence which threatens to destroy human > civilisation in the West. Maududi strongly opposed the small Ahmadiyya sect, a Muslim sect which Maududi and many other Muslims do not consider as Muslim. He preached against Ahmadiyya in his pamphlet The Qadiani Question and the book The Finality of Prophethood. ;Under the Islamic state The rights of non-Muslims are limited under Islamic state as laid out in Maududi's writings. Although non-Muslim \\"faith, ideology, rituals of worship or social customs\\" would not be interfered with, non-Muslims would have to accept Muslim rule. > Islamic 'jihad' does not recognize their right to administer state affairs > according to a system which, in the view of Islam, is evil. Furthermore, > Islamic 'jihad' also refuses to admit their right to continue with such > practices under an Islamic government which fatally affect the public > interest from the viewpoint of Islam.\\"Sayeed Abdul A'la Maududi, Jihad in > Islam, Islamic Publications (Pvt.) Ltd, p. 28. Non-Muslims would be eligible for \\"all kinds of employment\\", but must be \\"rigorously excluded from influencing policy decisions\\"Adams, Charles J., \\"Mawdudi and the Islamic State,\\" in John L. Esposito, ed., Voices of Resurgent Islam, (New York: Oxford University Press, 1983) and so not hold \\"key posts\\" in government and elsewhere.Maududi, Islamic Law and Constitution, 1977: p. 237 They would not have the right to vote in presidential elections or in elections of Muslim representatives. This is to ensure that \\"the basic policy of this ideological state remains in conformity with the fundamentals of Islam.\\" An Islamic Republic may however allow non-Muslims to elect their own representatives to parliament, voting as separate electorates (as in the Islamic Republic of Iran).Maududi, Islamic Law and Constitution, 1977: pp.236, 282, 288‚Äì97 While some might see this as discrimination, Islam has been the most just, the most tolerant and the most generous of all political systems in its treatment of minorities, according to Maududi. Non-Muslims would also have to pay a traditional special tax known as jizya. Under Maududi's Islamic state, this tax would be applicable to all able-bodied non-Muslim men‚Äîelderly, children and women being exempt‚Äîin return from their exemption from military service, (which all adult Muslim men would be subject to). Those who serve in the military are exempted. Non-Muslims would also be barred from holding certain high level offices in the Islamic state. Jizya is thus seen as a tax paid in return for protection from foreign invasion,Abul A'la Mawdudi, The Meaning of the Qur'an, (Islamic Publications Ltd., Lahore (1993 edition), vol 2, pp. 183 & 186 (last paragraph)). but also as a symbol of Islamic sovereignty. > ... Jews and the Christians ... should be forced to pay Jizya in order to > put an end to their independence and supremacy so that they should not > remain rulers and sovereigns in the land. These powers should be wrested > from them by the followers of the true Faith, who should assume the > sovereignty and lead others towards the Right Way.Abul A'la Mawdudi, The > Meaning of the Qur'an, vol 2, p. 183. =Jihad= Maududi's first work to come to public attention was Al Jihad fil- Islam (\\"Jihad in Islam\\"), which was serialized in a newspaper in 1927, when he was only twenty-four. In it he maintained that because Islam is all- encompassing, the Islamic state was for all the world and should not be limited to just the \\"homeland of Islam\\" where Muslims predominate. Jihad should be used to eliminate un-Islamic rule everywhere and establish a worldwide Islamic state: > Islam wishes to destroy all states and governments anywhere on the face of > the earth which are opposed to the ideology and programme of Islam, > regardless of the country or the nation which rules it. The purpose of Islam > is to set up a state on the basis of its own ideology and programme, > regardless of which nation assumes the role of the standard-bearer of Islam > or the rule of which nation is undermined in the process of the > establishment of an ideological Islamic State. Islam requires the earth‚Äînot > just a portion, but the whole planet.... because the entire mankind should > benefit from the ideology and welfare programme [of Islam] ... Towards this > end, Islam wishes to press into service all forces which can bring about a > revolution and a composite term for the use of all these forces is > 'Jihad'.... the objective of the Islamic 'jihƒÅd' is to eliminate the rule of > an un-Islamic system and establish in its stead an Islamic system of state > rule.Sayeed Abdul A'la Maududi, Jihad in Islam, pp. 6, 7, 22 Maududi taught that the destruction of the lives and property of others was lamentable (part of the great sacrifice of jihad), but that Muslims must follow the Islamic principle that it is better to \\"suffer a lesser loss to save ourselves from a greater loss\\". Though in jihad \\"thousands\\" of lives may be lost, this cannot compare \\"to the calamity that may befall mankind as a result of the victory of evil over good and of aggressive atheism over the religion of God.\\" He explained that jihad was not only combat for God but activity by the rear echelon in support those waging combat (qitaal), including non-violent work: > In the jihad in the way of Allah, active combat is not always the role on > the battlefield, nor can everyone fight in the front line. Just for one > single battle preparations have often to be made for decades on end and the > plans deeply laid, and while only some thousands fight in the front line > there are behind them millions engaged in various tasks which, though small > themselves, contribute directly to the supreme effort.Vol 2. No1. of The > Faithful Struggle in the section entitled \\"Permanent Jihad.\\" At the same time he took a more conservative line on jihad than other revivalist thinkers (such as Ayatollah Khomeini and Sayyid Qutb), distinguishing between jihad properly understood and \\"a crazed faith ... blood-shot eyes, shouting Allahu akbar, decapitating an unbeliever wherever they see one, cutting off heads while invoking La ilaha illa-llah [there is no god but God]\\". During a cease-fire with India (in 1948), he opposed the waging of jihad in Kashmir, stating that Jihad could be proclaimed only by Muslim governments, not by religious leaders. Mystique, personality, personal life As Jama'at amir, he remained in close contact with JI members, conducting informal discussions everyday in his house between Asar and Maghrib salat prayers, although according to some, in later years discussion was replaced by answers to members' questions with any rebuttals ignored. For his votaries in Jama'at, Maududi was not only a \\"revered scholar, politician, and thinker, but a hallowed Mujaddid.\\" Adding to his mystic was his survival of assassination attempts, while the Jama'at's enemies (Liaquat Ali Khan, Ghulam Muhammad, Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy, Ayub Khan, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, \\"fell from grace\\" or were killed. He had a powerful command of Urdu language which he insisted on using, in order to \\"free Muslims minds from the influence of English.\\" In private he has been described as \\"strict but not rigid\\", taciturn, poised, composed, uncompromising and unyielding. His biographers have talked of his karanat (special gifts) and haybah (great presence).\\" His public speaking style has been described as having \\"great authority\\". Maududi would make his argument step-by-step with Islamic edicts, rather than attempting to excite his audience with oratory. Although he did not publicize the fact, Maududi was a practitioner of traditional medicine or unani tibb. =Family and health= Maududi has been described as close to his wife, but not able to spend much time with his six sons and three daughters due to his commitments to religious dawah and political action. Only one of his offspring, ever joined the JI. And only his second daughter Asma, showed \\"any scholarly promise\\". Maududi suffered from a kidney ailment most of his life. He was often bedridden in 1945 and 1946, and in 1969 was forced to travel to England for treatment. =Late life= In April 1979, Maududi's long-time kidney ailment worsened and by then he also had heart problems. He went to the United States for treatment and was hospitalized in Buffalo, New York, where his second son worked as a physician. Following a few surgical operations, he died on 22 September 1979, at the age of 75. His funeral was held in Buffalo, but he was buried in an unmarked grave at his residence in Ichhra, Lahore after a very large funeral procession through the city. Yusuf al-Qaradawi led the funeral prayer for him. Legacy Grave of Abul Ala Maududi In Pakistan, (where the JI claims to be the oldest religious partyJamaat-e-Islami, GlobalSecurity.org. Retrieved 1 July 2007.) it is \\"hard to exaggerate the importance\\" of that country's \\"current drift\\" toward Maududi's \\"version of Islam\\", according to scholar Eran Lerman. His background as a journalist, thinker, scholar and political leader has been compared to Indian independence leader Abul Kalam Azad by admiring biographers. He and his party are thought to have been the most important factors in Pakistan working to generate support for an Islamic state. They are thought to have helped inspire General Zia-ul-Haq to introduce \\"Sharization\\" to Pakistan, (Sharia laws decreed by Zia included bans on interest on loans (riba), deduction by the government of 2.5% annual Zakat tax from bank accounts, introduction of Islamic punishments such as stoning and amputation with the 1979 Hudood Ordinances. One policy of Zia's that was originally proposed by Maududi, and not found in classic Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh), was the introduction of separate electorates for non- Muslims (Hindus and Christians) in 1985.) In return Maududi's party was greatly strengthened by Zia with 10,000s of members and sympathizers given jobs in the judiciary and civil service early in Zia's rule. Outside of South Asia, Muslim Brotherhood founder Hassan al-Banna and Sayyid Qutb read him, according to historian Philip Jenkins. Qutb \\"borrowed and expanded\\" Maududi's concept of Islam being modern, Muslims having fallen into pre-Islamic ignorance (Jahiliyya), and of the need for an Islamist revolutionary vanguard movement. His ideas influenced Abdullah Azzam, the Palestinian Islamist jurist and renewer of jihad in Afghanistan and elsewhere. The South Asian diaspora, including \\"significant numbers\\" in Britain, were \\"hugely influenced\\" by Maududi's work. Maududi even had a major impact on Shia Iran, where Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini is reputed to have met Maududi as early as 1963 and later translated his works into Persian. \\"To the present day, Iran's revolutionary rhetoric often draws on his themes.\\"tnr.com The New Republic \\"The roots of jihad in India\\" by Philip Jenkins, 24 December 2008 According to Youssef M. Choueiri, \\"all the major contemporary radicalist\\" Islamist movements (the Tunisian Islamic Tendency, the Egyptian Islamic Jihad organization, and the Muslim Brotherhood of Syria), \\"derive their ideological and political programmes\\" from the writings of Maududi and Sayyid Qutb. His works have also influenced leadership of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant in their ideology.https://cgpolicy.org/articles/interview-isiss-abdul-nasser-qardash/ Timeline of Abul A'la Maududi's life * 1903 ‚Äì Born in Aurangabad, Hyderabad State, colonial India * 1918 ‚Äì Started career as journalist in Bijnore newspaper * 1920 ‚Äì Appointed as editor of the daily Taj, based in Jabalpur * 1921 ‚Äì Learned Arabic from Maulana Abdul Salam Niazi in Delhi * 1921 ‚Äì Appointed as editor daily Muslim newspaper * 1926 ‚Äì Took the Sanad of Uloom e Aqaliya wa Naqalia from Darul Uloom Fatehpuri, Delhi * 1928 ‚Äì Took the Sanad in Jamay Al-Tirmidhi and Muatta Imam Malik Form same Teacher * 1925 ‚Äì Appointed as editor Al-jameeah, Delhi * 1927 ‚Äì Wrote Al- Jihad fil Islam * 1933 ‚Äì Started Tarjuman-ul-Qur'an from Hyderabad * 1937 ‚Äì Aged 34, introduced to South Asia's premier Muslim poet-philosopher, Allama Muhammad Iqbal, by Chaudhry Niaz Ali Khan at LahoreAzam, K.M., Hayat-e-Sadeed: Bani-e-Dar ul Islam Chaudhry Niaz Ali Khan (A Righteous Life: Founder of Dar ul Islam Chaudhry Niaz Ali Khan), Lahore: Nashriyat, 2010 (583 pp., Urdu) * 1938 ‚Äì Aged 35, moved to Pathankot from Hyderabad Deccan and joined the Dar ul Islam Trust Institute, which was established in 1936 by Chaudhry Niaz Ali Khan on the advice of Allama Muhammad Iqbal for which Chaudhry Niaz Ali Khan donated of land from his vast estate in Jamalpur, 5 km west of Pathankot * 1941 ‚Äì Founded Jamaat-e-Islami Hind at Lahore, British India; appointed as Amir * 1942 ‚Äì Jamaat's headquarters moved to Pathankot * 1942 ‚Äì Started writing a commentary of the Qur'an called Tafhim-ul-Quran * 1947 ‚Äì Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan headquarters moved to Lahore, Pakistan * 1948 ‚Äì Campaign for Islamic constitution and government * 1948 ‚Äì Thrown in jail by the Pakistani government for fatwa on jihad in Kashmir * 1949 ‚Äì Pakistani government accepted Jamaat's resolution for Islamic constitution * 1950 ‚Äì Released from jail * 1953 ‚Äì Sentenced to death for his historical part in the agitation against Ahmadiyah to write a booklet Qadiani Problem.

Major League Baseball In 1884, Oxley played Major League Baseball with both the New York Gothams (now known as the San Francisco Giants) and the New York Metropolitans. He played in just three games at the catcher position and ended his career without getting a hit. In his book, \\"Catcher: How the Man Behind the Plate Became an American Folk Hero,\\" baseball historian Peter Morris recounted a story about Oxley's first appearance in the major leagues. Morris wrote that, when Oxley noticed that the opposing team's catcher was wearing a chest protector, Oxley asked what the device was. Oxley decided to try using the device but did not realize that it needed to be inflated. When Oxley came into the game with a deflated chest protector, a player from the opposing team reportedly \\"took pity on him and showed him how to blow it up.\\" Oxley was also not wearing a face mask, a protective device that had been introduced seven years earlier. After the incident, a reporter wrote that Oxley must be from the \\"Green Mountains.\\" Oxley is one of only three players from Prince Edward Island (the others being Vern Handrahan and George Wood) to have played in Major League Baseball.\\"George (Dandy) Wood inducted into Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame\\" , Journal Pioneer, June 22, 2011.

It originally aired on April 9, 2007. Plot Ted has planned out a bachelor party for Marshall, since he is his best man. Barney wants to offer some input, but Marshall has said that he does not want a stripper at his bachelor party. Barney keeps trying to convince Ted, but Ted doesn't want to hear any of it from Barney. Ted's planned bachelor party involved watching a boxing match and eating large steaks from a cow he bought online. Barney foils this by amazingly getting a stripper into the hotel room (even though Barney thought that they were going to Atlantic City rather than Foxwoods). To make matters worse, the stripper breaks her ankle, causing everyone to miss the boxing match as she must go to the hospital, and then Barney demands that she continue on with the rest of her show, as she wants to do it. The rest of her show causes everyone but Barney to lose their appetite, and to top it all off, they are kicked out of the hotel due to a fire caused by Barney's cigar. Marshall and Ted return to MacLaren's bar, mad that Barney ruined the bachelor party. Meanwhile, Robin is in an awkward position at Lily's bridal shower, since (under Barney's advice) Robin has gotten her a \\"battery-powered adult recreational fake penis\\" (instead of a see-through nightie), and most of Lily's guests are much older family members, as well as several young children and Lily's cousin, who is about to become a nun. Robin tries to stop Lily from opening the gift and finally switches cards with another present to disguise her gift. When Lily opens Robin's gift (which Lily believes to be from her grandmother), Lily is shocked, but then Robin reveals that it was actually her gift, and the other relatives express their amusement. Lily and Robin go down to the bar afterwards and are surprised to see Ted and Marshall there. They explain that Barney ruined the bachelor party, and Marshall is even considering not inviting Barney to the wedding. Lily reveals a story: during the summer when the engagement was broken off, Barney, having had enough of Marshall's depression over losing Lily, flew out to San Francisco and told Lily to come back, as he thought they should be together, and that she might lose Marshall forever if she didn't come back. Barney goes on to tell Lily that he cannot keep stealing girls from Marshall forever, implying that he has been trying to provide an opportunity for Lily to return, even going so far as to purchase her a one way airline ticket. At this point, Barney is made co-best man with Ted, and Marshall is happy that Barney cared about their relationship. Critical response TV Squad rated the episode 5 out of a possible 7.

Having secured the imprimatur of the King of Sweden, The Natural Step was launched with attendant television coverage and distribution of educational material to every school and household in Sweden.

Environmental concerns Research on damage to human cells underscored, for Rob√®rt, the importance of environmental concerns.Rob√®rt, K.H. Curriculum Vitae. Blekinge Tekniska H√∂gskola (Blekinge Institute of Technology). He observed that since the late 19th Century, humans have been increasingly interfering with natural processes. He characterized many of the processes of modern society as linear (unidirectional, such as extractive mining technologies) that were producing garbage at unprecedented rates -- not only that visible in garbage dumps, but also unseen molecular garbage. Since \\"all linear processes must eventually come to an end,\\" the only way to save ourselves from the consequences, in his view, would be to restore the cyclical processes of nature: > For roughly the past hundred years, humans have been disrupting the cyclical > processes of nature at an accelerating pace. All human societies are, in > varying degrees, now processing natural resources in a linear direction. Our > resources are being rapidly transformed into useless garbage, some of which > is obvious to the naked eye, but most of which escapes awareness.

As a result of poor or non-existent planning, > the volume of garbage is too large for nature to reassimilate, and some of > it - toxic metals and stable unnatural compounds - cannot be processed by > the cells at all. He has argued against a proliferation of definitions of what constitutes sustainability. He promotes a change in \\"human life-styles and forms of societal organization that are based on cyclic processes compatible with the earth's natural cycles.\\" Origin of The Natural Step In 1989, he circulated a paper on sustainability to 50 scientists, asking for their input.

Photo from History of Colorado, edited by Wilbur Fiske Stone (1918). Bulkeley Wells (March 10, 1872-1931), also spelled Buckeley Wells, was an American businessperson involved in Mining. Born in Chicago to businessman Samuel Edgar Wells and Marry Agnes Bulkeley, Wells was educated at Roxbury Latin School and at Harvard University. He married into the wealthy family of Colonel Thomas L. Livermore, to daughter Grace Livermore. He moved to Telluride, Colorado, and joined the executive board of the Telluride Mining Association, and headed up the San Miguel County Citizens' Alliance (SMCCA). He had a deputy sheriff's commission, and was captain of Troop A of the Colorado National Guard. He was also a Mason, and an Elk. Wells became president and manager of the Smuggler-Union Mining Company after the murder of Arthur L. Collins.MaryJoy Martin, The Corpse On Boomerang Road: Telluride's War On Labor 1899-1908. Montrose, CO: Western Reflections Publishing Co., 2004; pp. 181, 231. Bulkeley Wells was noted for his hostility to unions. He conducted a campaign of vilification of Vincent Saint John, the head of the Telluride Miners' Union. Wells according to writer MaryJoy Martin, was \\"born to privilege... [and was] convinced laborers were beneath him,\\"The Corpse On Boomerang Road, Telluride's War On Labor 1899-1908, MaryJoy Martin, 2004, pages 231-232. was intent upon hanging Vincent St. John, the head of the local miners union. According to Martin, Wells colluded with others, including Pinkerton Agent James McParland, and the Colorado Mine Owners' Association, to accuse St. John of conducting a \\"reign of terror\\" -- and in particular, of murdering William J. Barney, a mine guard who had disappeared from his post. McParland, who decades earlier had been the special agent assigned to infiltrate the Molly Maguires in Pennsylvania, contributed his belief that an \\"Inner Circle\\" within the Western Federation of Miners was responsible for widespread assassinations.The Corpse On Boomerang Road, Telluride's War On Labor 1899-1908, MaryJoy Martin, 2004, page 102. Former McParland stenographer Morris Friedman wrote that McParland gained considerable income from Colorado's mining interests for the Pinkerton National Detective Agency by making such unproved accusations. At the time of his disappearance, the Telluride authorities didn't know any details of Will Barney's age, marital status, family, or where he came from. But they found some remains, and they drew conclusions. Wells placed a skull in a shop window, adorned with a sign decrying the \\"Grewsome Work\\" of the Telluride Miners' Union. There was one complicating factor: William Julius Barney wasn't dead.The Corpse On Boomerang Road, Telluride's War On Labor 1899-1908, MaryJoy Martin, 2004, pages 11-24 and 231-232. Wells had an affair with socialite Louise Sneed Hill while both were married. His wife, Grace Livermore Wells, divorced him in 1918.Debra Faulkner (December 3, 2010).

When he did not marry her, but eloped with another woman, Hill vowed to \\"break him\\" she persuaded his remaining financial backer, Harry Payne Whitney, to withdraw his support. He lost his mining empire and gas and oil speculations. He gambled and lost the last of his money. He committed suicide in 1931, while on the verge of bankruptcy.

The liner was launched in 1908 and was . The ship was attacked by a German U-boat during World War I, but survived. M√©gantic was taken out of service in 1931 and scrapped in 1933.  Career  The Dominion Line steamship company operated liners on the Liverpool-Canada route in the late 19th century and early 20th century. Their ships had become outdated, so in 1907 two new liners were ordered from Harland and Wolff, SS Albany and SS Alberta. However, while they were being built they were transferred to the White Star Line and with them the White Star Line itself entered the Canadian passenger trade.Megantic page at Shawsvillships Albany was renamed Megantic, after Lac-M√©gantic in Qu√©bec, and the Alberta became Laurentic. At the time, the two ships were the largest built to date for Canadian service and were used as a form of a full-scale experiment to decide on the machinery for the RMS Olympic and her sisters. Megantic being a conventional twin propeller ship with quadruple expansion engines while Laurentic, with the same hull and boiler power, was given three propellers and 2 four cylinder triple expansion engines and a center low pressure steam turbine design.Megantic at GreatShips.com Megantic was launched on 10 December 1908 and made her maiden voyage from Liverpool to Montr√©al on 17 June 1909. She remained on that route until the Great War, when she was briefly placed on White Star's Liverpool-New York City service until being called into service as a troopship in 1915. She was attacked in 1917 by the German submarine, , but managed to escape unharmed. She was returned to White Star in December 1918 and after a refit in 1919 to enlarge her 1st class accommodation, returned to the Canadian service from Liverpool. She had another refit in 1924 and after 1928 operated from London and Southampton. Off-season, Megantic was often used for cruising from New York to the Caribbean and in the 1930s, for economy cruises. After his arrest by Scotland Yard onboard the SS Montrose on the waters of the St-Lawrence in Canada, Dr. Hawley Harvey Crippen and his female accomplice Ethel Le Neve were returned to England on the Megantic. Crippen was hanged for murder in 1910, but Le Neve was acquitted and died in 1967. Megantic made her last Atlantic crossing in May 1931 and was then laid up until 1933, when she was sold for scrapping in Osaka. Megantic had a gross tonnage of 14,878 and a net of 9,183 tons.

He was the Irish national road race champion in 2000, 2001 and 2006, and won the Irish national time trial championships a record 6 times (2001, 2002, 2004, 2005, 2009 & 2010). He last rode for the Synergy Baku Cycling Project, an Azerbaijan-registered UCI Continental team. Biography In 2005, McCann captured the overall title at the Tour de Korea. In 2006 he won the Tour of Indonesia; 2 stages in the Tour of Thailand; 1 stage at the Tour of Qinghai Lake and 1 stage in the Tour of Azerbaijan. He represented Northern Ireland at the Commonwealth Games time trial, finishing 5th. On 20 September 2009, McCann broke Chris Boardman‚Äôs long-standing British 25 mile time trial record in Port Talbot. Later that week, he finished in 11th in the World Championships Elite Time Trial in Mendrisio, Switzerland. His time of 1:01:36.35 was 3 minutes 40 seconds behind the gold medallist Fabian Cancellara. This was McCann's best ever performance at the World Championships. He was UCI ranked 31st on the 2009 Asian Tour, and ranked 4th for the 2010 season with 298.66 points after 11 wins. He was UCI ranked 42nd on the 2011 UCI Asia Tour (75 pts), thanks mainly to 2nd place GC finishes in the Jelajah Malaysia and in the Tour de Taiwan. He rode on the Irish three man team for the 2010 World Championships alongside Nicolas Roche and Matt Brammeier, finishing 68th.ROCHE, BRAMMEIER AND MCCANN CONFIRMED FOR WORLDS He won a team pursuit bronze with Northern Ireland at the Commonwealth Games in Delhi, and followed this up with 5th in the Commonwealth Road Race. In 2002, McCann received a six-month suspension following a positive test for Norandrosterone. He claimed a contaminated glutamine supplement led to the finding. Like several other athletes suspended around this time, McCann was sponsored by sport nutrition company Maximmuscle. After testing 3 nanograms above the permitted level, Laboratory tests showed a legal glutamine supplement he was using contained a minute amount of norandrosterone not listed on the label. This led to him being given the minimum allowed six-month suspension.

American voice actress, who is perhaps best known for voicing journalist and reporter April O'Neil in the original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles animated series. Early life Renae Jacobs was born February 1, 1957 in Lansing, Michigan, moving to Los Angeles in the early 1980s to pursue a career as a voice actress. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles While working in Los Angeles in 1986, she received a call to audition for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. She was directed through the audition by Stu Rosen. The first day Rosen made it clear he didn't approve of her for the role, and had waited to show her audition after exhausting all the others. She has said that developed her initial personification of O'Neil after reading the description in the casting material, not the comics themselves: It was also the first role she was awarded that wasn't a \\"crazy little made up fantasy character\\". In June 2014, it was announced that Jacobs would guest-star on season three of Nickelodeon's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. She played April's long-lost mother in the episode \\"Buried Secrets\\" who was, in truth, a Kraang creature that had been infused with the human DNA of the real Mrs. O'Neil as an infiltration experiment. Voice work, appearances She appeared as a contestant on the NBC game show Sale of the Century in late 1985 but did not win her game though she did win almost $900 in cash & prizes. She was also the \\"Lady of the Maze\\" in the first season of the Family Channel game show Masters of the Maze. She has also done voices in other animated series and films including The Glo Friends Save Christmas, It's Punky Brewster!, The Adventures of Don Coyote and Sancho Panda, Moon Dreamers, My Little Pony and all films of Rose Petal Place.

Only the water tower, AT&T; Alascom headquarters and Hollywood Vista site can be plainly seen, with tall trees along the bluff obscuring the rest of the view. Government Hill is a neighborhood in the northwest part of Anchorage, Alaska, sitting in between Anchorage's downtown area and the western reaches of Joint Base Elmendorf- Richardson, specifically the portion formerly known as Elmendorf Air Force Base. The neighborhood is named for the \\"hill\\" it sits on of about >Radar Structure of Earthquake-Induced, Coastal Landslides in Anchorage, Alaska - USGS WR CMG bearing the same name, which is actually a bluff which rises alongside the northern banks of Ship Creek. The origins of the name date to 1915, when a federal land reserve was created in the area for the Alaska Engineering Commission, then heavily involved in constructing the Alaska Railroad nearby. The neighborhood sits alongside Knik Arm in north Anchorage. It is very ethnically diverse. Numerous Korean emigrants to Anchorage over the years have made Government Hill their first home in the city. Many residents work either in downtown Anchorage or at JBER, which flank the neighborhood to the south and north, respectively. Both are within walking distance. History =Early 20th century= Loxtave house at 821 Brown Street. The house was moved or demolished ca. 2002 to make way for a new house on that lot. Government Hill is often called Anchorage's oldest and first neighborhood. The U.S. government withdrew the area from inclusion as part of the Anchorage townsite, and instead created a reserve for housing workers from the railroad and other federal entities doing work in the area. The AEC constructed 13 houses in the southwest corner of the area in 1915. This area was listed as Government Hill Federal Housing Historic District on the National Register of Historic Places in 2015. Loop Road had appeared by the 1920s, which connected Anchorage with the extensive farms by then operating north and northeast of the town. Robert Atwood, describing his early years in Anchorage in his autobiography, referred to Loop Road as the only interesting drive to be had in the area. The farms would be acquired by the federal government in the late 1930s to create Elmendorf as well as Fort Richardson. The Alaska Railroad subdivided the remainder of the reserve not taken by the military in 1945 and 1946. Scores of World War II-era surplus and prefabricated buildings, such as Quonset huts, Loxtave houses (developed by the U.S. Navy) and Harman houses (developed by a short-lived Philadelphia- based company), were moved onto the lots. A small number of these original structures still exist in the neighborhood today, virtually all of them west of Loop Road. Several of the streets built in these subdivisions were later named for Alaska Railroad officials of that era: Colwell Street for George Walter Colwell, chief engineer, Cunningham Street for John Todd Cunningham, superintendent of transportation, and Delaney Street for James J. Delaney, assistant general manager. =Latter 20th century and beyond= A substantial shopping area appeared near the intersection of Loop and Bluff Roads, directly next to the gate of Elmendorf, starting in the 1950s. National Bank of Alaska had a branch in the largest shopping mall for a number of years. One of the first bowling alleys in Anchorage, Anchorbowl, opened in 1953. In terms of competitive viability, this area had fallen on hard times by the 1980s, mostly on account of the shifting retail landscape of the time, as well as the expansion of the Carrs Quality Centers grocery chain into the expanding outlying areas of the Anchorage bowl. Remaining and subsequent businesses were geared mostly to a military clientele. Earthquake damage Government Hill Elementary School, following the earthquake. Government Hill, along with portions of downtown Anchorage and the Turnagain-By-The-Sea subdivision southwest of downtown, were among the hardest hit in the earthquake of March 27, 1964.Anchorage  District Guide City Guide  WCities Destination Guide A landslide along the bluff immediately east of Loop Road, estimated as covering over , resulted in the destruction of Government Hill Elementary School, two residences atop the bluff, and a railroad building at the bottom. The west wing of the school was sheared in two. Due to continuing instability of the land underneath, the building was left as it was and the site fenced off, until the site was redeveloped as a neighborhood park in 1985. Infrastructure =Education= Government Hill Elementary was rebuilt in 1965 on military lands next to Alaska Communications System (current AT&T; Alascom) headquarters, a short distance north of the original school building. The school had 479 students during the 2005-2006 school year.http://www.asdk12.org/depts/assess_eval/report_cards/current/230reportcard.pdf The school has been noted for its bilingual teaching methods using both Spanish and English.The Gift Of Two Languages  Minority Achievement  NW Education =Recreation= Government Hill is the location of the Anchorage Curling Club, which has made the neighborhood its home since 1962.

At times considered part of the neighborhood is the Port of Anchorage immediately to the west, which transfers about 15 million tons of fuel a year. Portions of the Alaska Railroad yards to the south are also considered to be part of the neighborhood. A bridge was built ca. 1975 over the Ship Creek valley and railroad yards, which directly links downtown Anchorage with Government Hill and the Port. Loop Road was widened and an interchange was built at the bridge's northern end. The area around this interchange has seen numerous serious accidents in the years since. Government Hill also plays a huge role in the Knik Arm Bridge debate. The plan proposes to build a highway and bridge across the Knik Arm from northern Anchorage and along the Susitna River drainage to connect to the Parks Highway, bypassing the densely populated central portions of the Matanuska-Susitna Borough, particularly Wasilla. Many Government Hill residents oppose the plan, since many of the options presented would bisect the neighborhood.Microsoft Word - 8-12-05 GHCC KABATA Comments.doc Government Hill is served by the #11 People Mover route, linking it to Downtown and Fairview. https://www.muni.org/Departments/transit/PeopleMover/Pages/mapsandstops.aspx =Other= Also considered to be part of Government Hill, though not part of the original subdivisions, were 51 apartment buildings which were originally part of Elmendorf's main housing area. Though the names have changed slightly over the years, these buildings were generally known as the Richardson Vista, Panoramic View and Hollywood Vista apartment complexes. A fire station (no longer used as such, deemed unnecessary when the downtown fire station was relocated to provide direct access to the bridge) marked the demarcation point between the apartments and the mostly single-family remainder of Government Hill. Hollywood Vista was condemned in 1989, after falling into stages of neglect and disrepair for over a decade under various owners. The buildings were razed in 1997. The Municipality of Anchorage currently owns the land, and has faced periodic political battles over the years over how to redevelop the site.

It also reduced the silver content of the half dollar from 90 percent to 40 percent; silver in the half dollar was subsequently eliminated by a 1970 law. There had been coin shortages beginning in 1959, and the United States Bureau of the Mint expanded production to try to meet demand. The early 1960s was a time of increased use of silver both in the coinage and in industry, putting pressure on the price of silver, which was capped at just over $1.29 per ounce by government sales at that price. The silver in a dollar's worth of quarters would be worth more as bullion than as money if the price of the metal rose past $1.38 per ounce, and there was widespread hoarding of silver coins. Demand for the Kennedy half dollar as a collectable drove it from circulation after its debut in 1964. The Bureau of the Mint increased production, helping reduce the coin shortages by May 1965, but government stocks of silver were being rapidly reduced, and threatened to run out by 1968. After extensive study by the Treasury Department, President Lyndon B. Johnson in June 1965 recommended that Congress pass legislation to allow for silverless dimes and quarters, and debased silver half dollars. Although there was some opposition, mainly from legislators representing Western mining states, the bill progressed rapidly through Congress, and was enacted with Johnson's signature on July 23, 1965. The new coins began to enter circulation in late 1965, and alleviated the shortages. They passed side by side with their silver counterparts for a time, but the precious metal coins were hoarded beginning in 1967 as the Treasury ended its efforts to keep silver prices low. The act also banned the production of silver dollars until at least 1970.  Background  The Coinage Act of 1792 established the Mint of the United States, and made both gold and silver legal tender. This meant that anyone could present bullion at the Philadelphia Mint and receive it back, struck into coins. The 1792 act authorized six silver coins, in value from five cents to a dollar, and prescribed their weights and fineness. Making a dollar equal to given quantities of both gold and silver made the currency vulnerable to variations in the price of precious metals, and U.S. coins flowed overseas for melting until adjustments were made to their size and weight in 1834 and again with the Coinage Act of 1853, when the amount of bullion in the silver coins worth less than a dollar was reduced. The fact that the dime (ten-cent piece), quarter dollar, and other smaller silver coins contained less silver in proportion to the dollar helped keep them in circulation. With the Coinage Act of 1873, the dollar was no longer equivalent to a set amount of silver, a statutory change made so that as the price of silver dropped with increased U.S. production, mining companies could not present their bullion at the mints and receive it back, struck into silver dollars worth more as money than they were as metal. By the post-World War II era, the Bureau of the Mint was striking the three remaining precious metal coins, the dime, quarter and half dollar in 90 percent silver‚Äîthe dollar had not been coined since 1935 and circulated little outside some Western states like Nevada and Montana. The metal in a silver dollar was worth more as bullion than as money above $1.2929 per troy ounce; the smaller coins would be attractive for the melting pot above $1.38 per ounce. Beginning in 1934, the price of silver in the United States was effectively set by the government as it would support that price through purchases and sales of the metal; in 1934 it was $0.45 per troy ounce. In 1958, with the return of lend-lease bullion, the Treasury's stock of silver reached 2.1 billion troy ounces; it began to offer the metal at $0.91 per ounce to the public, despite the warnings of the Conference of Western Governors that there was not enough silver to make these sales and maintain coinage operations. Worldwide consumption of silver more than doubled between 1958 and 1965, but production increased by only about 15 percent. Industrial uses for silver included photographic film, batteries, and electronic components. At the same time, the Mint's production of silver coin increased as it attempted to meet demand; it used 111.5 million troy ounces of silver in coinage in 1963, up from just over 38 million in 1958. In spite of the increased demand, silver prices were checked by the fact that the Treasury would redeem silver certificates: paper money exchangeable for silver dollars (or the bullion equivalent, 0.7734 troy ounces), thus placing a ceiling of $1.29 per ounce on the market. Without government as the supplier of last resort, silver would rise in price, likely making it profitable to melt not only silver dollars, but the subsidiary silver coins as well. In 1963, the gap between production and consumption by the non-communist world amounted to 209 million ounces. Just lower than world production (210 million ounces), this gap was filled by the sale of Treasury silver at $1.29 per ounce. Even a rise in the price of silver likely would not have led to a major jump in production, as silver was for the most part obtained as a by-product in the mining of other metals, such as copper and lead. The Bureau of the Mint in 1955 ended coinage operations at the San Francisco Mint, deeming it cheaper to supply the West Coast with coins from Denver. The Denver Mint (opened in 1906) had been modernized twice, in contrast to the aging Philadelphia Mint, constructed in 1901 and with much of its coinage equipment dating from then. Plans for a replacement facility had been scuttled multiple times by political infighting, as a new mint was sought not only by different cities, but by various neighborhoods of the city of Philadelphia.  Coin shortage  In the postwar era, occasional coin shortages had been known, often local and seasonal, and generally brief in duration. The shortage might affect one of the five denominations (cent, nickel, dime, quarter and half dollar) being minted for circulation. The Federal Reserve Banks (\\"the Fed\\"), responsible for obtaining coins from the Mint and distributing them on request to member banks, also performed the function of receiving from these banks coins they did not need, a process known as \\"flowback\\". Coins were returned from commercial banks to the Fed, were processed and cleaned, and were then sent to banks needing them. These recycled pieces represented the bulk of what the Fed shipped, and perhaps only a fifth were new coins. The banks accustomed themselves to seasonal need for coins, as for quarters and half dollars in Michigan to pay cherry pickers the traditional 75-cent rate, and to local preferences; for example, half dollars were not popular in New York, two quarters being preferred instead. Beginning in late 1959, the Mint failed to provide enough coins to satisfy demand, and the Fed, through its district banks and branches, imposed rationing. By 1963, there was often rationing of all denominations, commercial banks (and their retail customers) receiving less than they needed. There were widespread shortages of some denominations during the 1962 holiday shopping season. Traditionally, the heavy demand for coinage late in the year resulted in a large amount of flowback in the winter, but in early 1963, few coins returned to the banks, or to the Fed. Officials suggested responsibility might lie with coin collectors and investors, as well as uncollected coins remaining in the nation's millions of vending machines. The Mint increased production to around-the-clock shifts at Philadelphia and Denver. A new Philadelphia Mint was authorized in 1963, though the hoped-for opening date of 1966 was soon pushed back to 1967 (it eventually opened in 1969). The coin shortage did not ease during 1963. In spite of heavy production by the two mints, early 1964 saw but a trickle of flowback, alarming the Fed. Investigation showed that banks and their business customers were retaining coins, fearing shortages. Many of the silver ones were being taken out of circulation by people believing the price of that metal would rise. The Treasury began removing silver certificates from circulation, replacing them with Federal Reserve Notes. This helped free up silver that did not have to be held as backing for the certificates, which the Treasury redeemed with silver bullion instead of dollar coins after March 1964, when it stopped paying out silver dollars. It had almost depleted a stock that had been at just under 273 million in 1954. There had been a run on the Treasury for them; citizens could obtain up to 50,000 in a day, and payment in silver certificates was not required. In much-photographed scenes at the Treasury Building in Washington, citizens had shown up with wheelbarrows, armed guards, and even armored cars to haul away the silver. The remaining silver dollars held in the Treasury (2,970,928 as of May 20, 1965) had high numismatic value; Congress in 1970 authorized their sale at a premium to collectors. President Kennedy's assassination in November 1963 led to calls to honor him with a place on one of the circulating coins, and the Kennedy half dollar was authorized by Congress on December 30. When 26 million of the new coins were issued on March 24, 1964, they were immediately hoarded, both by investors and by those wanting a memento of Kennedy, and the situation did not ease as more coins were produced. One-third of the record-breaking 202.5 million ounces of silver used in coinage in 1964 thus became coins that did not circulate. Congress allowed the Mint to continue to strike 1964-dated pieces into 1965, hoping to make them not worth putting aside. Congress in August 1964 passed an appropriation intended to be used for striking 45 million silver dollars. The Senate Majority Leader, Mike Mansfield, was from hard-money Montana and insisted on the Mint proceeding. The Mint struck over 300,000 of them, bearing the Peace dollar design and the date 1964, in May 1965 but due to a public outcry that the coins would only be hoarded, they were melted. The minting had been at the direction of President Lyndon Johnson; the subsequent flip-flop on the question left Nevada Senator Alan Bible, a prominent supporter of the mining industry, unimpressed with the administration's leadership on coin matters, feeling officials were leaving the mess for Congress to straighten out. He introduced legislation to outlaw hoarding, export, and melting of U.S. coins, but the bill went nowhere. In the interim, the coin shortage continued, putting supermarkets, drugstores, and other large retail establishments under great pressure. Two chains in the Midwest commissioned their own paper scrip, but this was never issued as the Treasury warned it trespassed on the federal prerogative to coin money. Stores urged customers to break open piggy banks and bring in the contents. Coins obtained by newsboys, vending-machine operators, and churches on collection plates were ardently sought after by stores and banks. They had competition in this regard, as investors also wanted the coins, and withdrew them from circulation. In addition to the circulated coinage, investors wanted the new 1964 pieces (especially the half dollar) and a lively market in rolls and large canvas bags of coins developed in the pages of Coin World, with the advertisements examined at congressional hearings. Some banks were offered ample quantities of coin at a premium, or the exchange of bags of old coinage for the new; most refused, and bank employees who cooperated with would-be accumulators were fired. Numismatic writer David Lange pointed out that the collecting of recent coins in rolls peaked in 1964, and believed the coin collecting hobby's blame for the shortage unfair. The Mint arranged to outsource part of the coin-making process, and pledged to flood the nation with coins by 1965. Despite an increased need for coins in an improving economy, merchants made it past the 1964 holiday season without severe shortages, though the half dollar had stopped circulating. Most Fed facilities reported sufficient supplies of cents and nickels, with some still short on dimes and quarters, and shortages of half dollars everywhere‚Äîone Fed official wrote that his branch had not seen a half dollar deposited by a bank in eight months. The Treasury conducted extensive research, and in May 1965 concluded that the nation could not go on using so much silver in its coinage. It decided on clad coinage, with copper- nickel faces and a pure copper core, as the most desirable replacement material. Such a composition would work in place of silver in vending machines, which would not require wholesale adjustment. Copper and nickel were readily available, and the melt value of the new coins would be much under face value. The material was hard, allowing the designs to remain recognizable for long periods, and other nations, such as the United Kingdom, had transitioned from silver to copper-nickel coins. The Mint conducted lengthy test runs, and did not experience production problems.  Legislation  On June 3, 1965, President Johnson sent a special message to Congress, asking it to pass legislation allowing the dime and quarter to be made from base metal, and to reduce the silver content of the half dollar to 40 percent. The silver dollar would be unaffected if any were struck, but there were no plans to do so. He noted that the metal for the silver coinage was being struck from dwindling Treasury stocks, rather than from newly mined silver, and that the government bullion would be entirely used up by 1968. Johnson argued that the metal necessary for industry must not be wasted as a means of exchange. He urged the passage of draft legislation, attached to the message, and said the bill would \\"ensure a stable and dignified coinage, fully adequate in quantity and in its specially designed technical characteristics to the needs of our Twentieth Century life. It can be maintained indefinitely, however much the demand for coin may grow.\\" Under Johnson's proposal, there would be no change in the cent or nickel, but the dime and quarter would be made with a clad composition, that is copper-nickel bonded to a core of pure copper; the half dollar would have 80 percent silver faces and the core would contain 21 percent silver. The clad alloy had similar electrical properties to silver, and so would work in existing vending machines. He also sent the Treasury Staff Report on which his recommendations were based. This report had been expected in February, but had been repeatedly delayed, in part because outgoing Treasury Secretary C. Douglas Dillon felt that his successor should approve the plan, as he would have to live with the consequences. The new secretary, Henry H. Fowler, had needed time to study the problem, further delaying the report's issuance. If adopted, the bill would reduce the need for silver in U.S. coinage by 90 percent. Hearings on the president's proposal, introduced as H.R. 8926, began before the House Banking and Currency Committee on June 4. Chairman Wright Patman, the bill's sponsor, deemed it to have something for everyone, including price supports for silver, though industrial users would benefit most, as the silver formerly used in coinage would be freed up for commercial use. Most business stakeholders, including the banks, the vending machine operators, and corporate leaders, wanted to see the bill pass, it being better than the current situation. On June 11, the committee issued a report recommending the bill pass, with amendments requiring the half dollar to be made of base metal, requiring the silver coins that would be struck during the transition period to be dated 1964, and banning the striking of silver dollars for five years. One day of hearings on S. 2080, the version introduced into the Senate, was held before that body's Committee on Banking and Currency on June 9, with Virginia Senator A. Willis Robertson, the chairman, presiding. Senator Bible and others from mining states sought to retain silver in the currency or include provisions from Bible's earlier bill banning hoarding of coins, but they were not successful. On June 11, the Senate committee issued a report recommending the bill's passage, with several amendments, mostly technical in nature. The bill required the Treasury to buy newly mined U.S. silver at $1.25 per ounce when presented by mining companies; a five-year limit was placed on this. The Senate considered the bill between June 22 and 24, 1965. An amendment by Rhode Island Senator John Pastore to remove silver entirely from the half dollar failed, 32‚Äì60. A number of senators wished to retain silver in the dime and quarter, and called for them to be made from 40 percent silver, but an amendment to that effect was defeated. There were other failed amendments, including one by Bible to prohibit melting of silver coins by the public. Robertson was determined to prevent any changes to the bill, which had been unanimously approved by his committee, and each attempt failed. The bill passed the Senate, 74‚Äì9, the opponents being Bible and other Western senators. The House of Representatives debated the bill on July 13 and 14, 1965. The discussion was wide-ranging. Idaho Congressman Compton I. White opposed the bill, having prepared a chart showing the debasement of the Roman denarius between the years 1 and 300, though stating that he did not expect that coinage debasement would cause a government to fall. Nevada's Walter S. Baring noted that the Treasury was selling silver to the makers of cutlery and stated, \\"I would rather eat with chopsticks than take the silver out of our coinage\\". Massachusetts' Silvio Conte denigrated Sir Thomas Gresham for illicit profits when the Royal Exchange in London was established, but conceded that Gresham's Law would nevertheless cause base metal coins to drive the silver ones from circulation. Iowa's Harold Gross asked Conte that if the U.S. was going to debase its coinage, why not go back to wampum. Minor amendments, including removing the mint mark from coinage for up to five years, were agreed to. There was objection to the committee amendment removing silver entirely from the half dollar; it was defeated 48‚Äì94, leaving the half dollar at 40 percent silver. Congressman James F. Battin of Montana offered an amendment to make the dime and quarter out of 40 percent silver; although Patman objected that the committee had rejected the idea, it initially passed 122‚Äì112. However, this was at the Committee of the Whole stage, and Patman got the House to reject the Battin amendment, 197‚Äì218. After other attempts were made in vain to derail the bill, the House Minority Leader, Michigan's Gerald R. Ford, asked that there be a recorded vote on H.R. 8926, and the bill passed, 255‚Äì151, Ford voting in favor. Patman then had the House amend the Senate bill, S. 2080, to reflect the House-passed language, and pass it. The House notified the Senate that it had passed S. 2080. The Senate, considering the bill on July 15, could either agree to the House amendments or go to a conference committee, and after disgruntlement at some of the House amendments‚Äîthe House had greatly expanded the membership of the Joint Commission on the Coinage, which was to make recommendations on useful changes‚Äîthe Senate passed the House's version without a recorded vote, though Washington's Warren Magnuson requested that the record show him as voting against the bill. President Johnson enacted S. 2080 as the Coinage Act of 1965 with his signature on July 23, 1965.  Provisions  = Title I‚ÄîAuthorization of additional coinage (sections 101 to 108) = A clad 1965 quarter, worn by years of circulation Section 101 authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to issue dimes, quarters, and half dollars of clad composition, with the half dollar to be made of 40 percent silver. So long as there was a shortage of coins, the Mint could strike dimes, quarters, and half dollars from .900 silver, but this authority was to end once the secretary certified there was an adequate supply of the new coins in circulation, and in any event five years after the law was enacted (thus, ending July 23, 1970). During that five-year period, no standard silver dollars could be minted.Coinage Act of 1965 Section 102 made all coins and currency of the United States legal tender without limit, reiterating language found in the Act of May 12, 1933. That part of the 1933 act was repealed in section 210 to avoid possible legal arguments that section 102 did other than restate existing law. Section 103 gave the secretary broad discretion to acquire equipment, supplies, and patent rights to expedite the production of coins during the emergency, with the provision again to expire after five years. Section 104 required the secretary to purchase at $1.25 per troy ounce silver bullion of U.S. origin within a year of the month in which it was mined. According to the Senate committee report on the bill, section 104 was intended \\"as a precautionary measure to protect our mining industry from any undue downward fluctuations in the market during the period of transition\\". This provision, which was limited to five years by the House committee, was deemed to be \\"continuing government interference in the market for silver\\" by the American Institute for Economic Research in its report on Johnson's message to Congress. Section 105 authorized the secretary to prohibit the melting, export, or treating of any coin, if necessary to protect the nation's coinage, and prescribed a penalty of up to five years in prison for violation of such an order‚Äîsection 106 declared that coins seized under section 105 would be forfeited to the United States, with the secretary given powers paralleling those under the Internal Revenue Code to enforce such forfeitures. Section 107 allowed the secretary to issue regulations to put into force the Coinage Act of 1965, while section 108 contained definitions and similar technical matters. = Title II‚ÄîAmendments of existing law (sections 201 to 212) = Section 201 amended legislation regarding the San Francisco Assay Office to allow coins to be minted there (as they previously were when it was the San Francisco Mint) until such time as the secretary certified that the mints of the United States were able to strike sufficient coins to meet the needs of the nation. It also repealed a provision of law not allowing gold or silver to be refined at the San Francisco facility. Section 202 increased the amount appropriated to expand Mint facilities (including the construction of the new Philadelphia Mint) from $30 million to $45 million. Section 9 of the Gold Standard Act of 1900 had required the Treasury Secretary to melt silver coins that were worn or no longer current, and restrike them into new ones; this was repealed by section 203 and the secretary was given authority to withdraw and melt all worn or uncurrent coins without needing to reuse the metal in coinage. Section 204 amended the Coinage Act of 1873, which required the year of striking to appear on coins. During the 1965 or subsequent coinage emergency, the secretary could continue to strike coins dated with a year that has passed, with the silver ones in the present crisis to be dated 1964, and the clad ones 1965 or after. The House Banking Committee added language to Johnson's proposal, eliminating mint marks on coins for up to five years, excepting the mint mark \\"D\\" for Denver on 1964-dated coins struck there. A bullion fund was authorized under previous law within the Mint; section 205 allowed purchases of silver made under section 104 to be paid for from this fund. Another Mint account, the minor coinage metal fund, used to purchase copper and other metals for cents and nickels, was redesignated the coinage metal fund by section 206, usable for all denominations, and that section eliminated statutory limits on how much money can be in that fund. Section 207 repealed obsolete limitations on wastage in the Mint's operations, but directed that administrative regulations be developed on the subject, which could be more easily changed. Section 208 repealed a provision of the 1873 act requiring coinage dies for the obverse, which are dated, to be destroyed at the end of each year. Section 209 rephrased statutory provisions allowing the Treasury to sell silver at a price not less than $1.292929 per ounce, and allowed it to sell silver to other government departments for less. Section 210 repealed the 1933 provision regarding the legal tender status of coins. The law prior to 1965 made it a felony to forge silver coins; this was amended by section 211 to forbid the counterfeiting of coins with denomination greater than five cents. Section 212 made using coins as security for loans a misdemeanor if the secretary has made a proclamation in the Federal Register proscribing their use as collateral. = Title III‚ÄîJoint Commission on the Coinage (sections 301 to 304) = Sections 301 to 303 establish a Joint Commission on the Coinage in the Executive Branch, chaired by the Treasury Secretary. Its membership was to include the Commerce Secretary, Budget Director, Mint Director, six members of the House, six of the Senate, and eight members of the public, appointed by the president. If a member of the commission left the position that qualified him for membership, he would leave the commission as well. The members of the public were not to have any financial conflicts of interest. The Joint Commission was tasked to report on the implementation of the Coinage Act of 1965, and make recommendations from time to time to the president, the Treasury Secretary, and Congress. The matters within its remit were to include technological advances, the need of the economy for coins, whether the U.S. should continue to maintain the price of silver, and whether the silver dollar should again be minted. Section 304 appropriated such money as might be needed to carry out the Coinage Act.  Aftermath  A $5 silver certificate, no longer redeemable at the Treasury The Mint began to strike the first of the 1965-dated clad coins, quarters, on August 23 of that year, making them the first U.S. coins to bear that date. By November 1965, with the Christmas shopping season beginning, the Fed had only 15 million of the old silver quarters in reserve. That month, though, the Mint released over 230 million of the new clad quarters, and stated that an equal number would be issued every month. This figure quadrupled the previous record monthly production. The new dime and half dollar were released in early 1966, a time when flowback to the Fed increased for all denominations being struck except the half dollar. That denomination failed to return to circulation, as they continued to be withdrawn. The Mint continued to strike 1964-dated silver pieces under the authority of the Coinage Act until 1966, when Secretary Fowler announced, \\"the coin shortage is over\\". In July 1966, the Treasury announced that coins struck after August 1, 1966, would bear the date of minting. Silver inventories at the Treasury continued to drop through 1966 as the government attempted to maintain the $1.2929 price of silver. The Joint Commission on the Coinage, authorized by the Coinage Act, held its first meeting in May 1967 to recommend how to deal with the situation. At its recommendation, the Treasury discontinued sales it deemed speculative, and to foreign buyers, attempting to supply only U.S. industry at that price, and resulting in a two-tier price system for silver. It also invoked its authority under the Coinage Act to prohibit the melting or export of silver coins. In June 1967, it obtained legislation making silver certificates no longer exchangeable for bullion effective after a year. After the Joint Commission's second meeting, in July 1967, the Treasury announced that it would no longer attempt to maintain the $1.2929 price as it could keep the nation supplied even if all the remaining silver coins vanished from circulation, as they soon did. By the time silver certificate redemptions ended on June 24, 1968, the price of silver had risen to $2.56 per ounce. Although the Joint Commission in December 1968 voted to recommend making the prohibitions on melting or exporting silver coin permanent, it reconsidered and in March 1969, the bans were lifted. In November 1969, the government left the silver market, making its final sales of bullion to the Franklin Mint. Mint marks returned to the coinage in 1968. The new coins came to be pejoratively known as \\"Johnson sandwiches\\" for their copper interiors.Denver Gold and Silver, \\"United States Quarters \\", accessed 2019.07.23.Mike Sherman, \\"Happy 50th Anniversary to the Sandwich\\", PCGS, December 29, 2014. Walking Liberty and post-1970 Kennedy half dollar coins; the clad coins on the right are instantly recognisable as their copper cores are visible on the edges. With the end of the Coinage Act's five-year prohibition on the striking of silver dollars approaching in 1969 and 1970, many in Congress wanted a new silver dollar, bearing the image of the recently deceased president, Dwight D. Eisenhower. The melt value of the new part-silver half dollars had approached their face value, and in 1969, the Joint Commission recommended the elimination of that metal from the halves. The battle over whether to have silver in the proposed dollar proved contentious, and it was not until December 31, 1970, that President Richard Nixon signed legislation for a circulating half dollar and Eisenhower dollar, both silverless, with part-silver collector's versions of the dollar also authorized. The same bill authorized the sale of the remaining old silver dollars in government inventories, many from the Carson City Mint. The base metal dollar and half dollar were struck beginning in 1971. Both failed to circulate: the \\"Ike dollar\\" because of its size, and the half dollar because its place in commerce had been lost during its long absence.

Its task was to mobilise the youth of Catalonia (Spain) in order to achieve an independent and socialist nation. The term \\"maulet\\" comes from the popular name given to Austriacist supporters in the Kingdom of Valencia during the War of the Spanish Succession.  History  Maulets was founded in 1988 as the youth wing of Catalunya Lliure (Free Catalonia). During its first years of existence, it led much of the action in the streets, including clashes with Spanish police. This struggle led to the imprisonment and torture of some of Maulet's members, including N√∫ria Cadenas who was charged with terrorism and membership of Terra Lliure. The difficult years after the great repression of 1992 (Garz√≥n Operation) seriously weakened Maulets, leaving the organisation with the difficult task of rebuilding a half torn movement during the 90s. By 1998 it had fused with Joventuts Independentistes Revolucion√†ries (Pro- independence Revolutionary Youth), and the start of the 21st century saw expansion of the organisation's base, with new chapters being created all over the nation.

She was converted to an armed merchant cruiser at the onset of World War I, and sank after striking two mines north of Ireland on 25 January 1917, with the loss of 354 lives. She was carrying about 43 tons of gold ingots at the time of her loss, and as of 2017, 20 bars of gold are yet to be recovered. Background The construction of Laurentic The Dominion Line steamship company operated a successful passenger service on their Liverpool-Canada route in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Their ships had become outdated, so in 1907 two new liners were ordered from Harland and Wolff, and constructed at their yard in Belfast. During their construction they were purchased by the White Star Line, and became its first ships in the Canadian passenger trade. The ships were originally named SS Alberta and SS Albany, and after the transfer of ownership Alberta was renamed Laurentic and her sister Albany became . Design At the time, the two were the largest ships yet built for Canadian service and they were used as a form of full-scale experiment to decide on the machinery for the White Star Line's future s. Megantic was built as a conventional twin- screw ship with conventional quadruple expansion engines, while Laurentic, with the same hull and boiler power, was given an experimental configuration known as 'combination machinery', consisting of three screws: The two wing propellers were driven by 4-cylinder triple expansion engines, while the third centre propeller was driven by a low pressure steam turbine, utilising the exhaust steam from the first two engines. Later comparisons of the performance of the two ships revealed that Laurentic produced 20% more power than her sister for the same steam consumption, and for the same power output, Laurentics coal consumption was twelve to fifteen percent lower than that of Megantic. As the experiment was considered a success, the same arrangement was chosen for use in the three Olympic-class liners. Career Laurentic was launched in 1908 and departed on her maiden voyage 29 April 1909, from Liverpool to Quebec City, with 1,057 passengers on board. She normally served on the Liverpool-Canada route, and also stopped in New York during the winter months. While crossing the Atlantic to New York on 22 January 1910, she was caught in a powerful storm; waves destroyed the windows of the upper deck and flooded the navigation bridge and the officers' quarters, disabling the service command transmitters. The ship survived, and arrived safely to port. Laurentic gained notoriety later in 1910 during the capture of murderer Hawley Harvey Crippen, in which Chief Inspector Walter Dew of the Metropolitan Police used Laurentics speed to arrive in Canada before the fleeing suspect on . Laurentic during her war serviceDuring her regular service from Liverpool, Laurentic passed near where had sunk a few days earlier. On 21 April 1912 Captain John Mathias reported \\"he had kept a careful lookout while passing over the Grand Banks, and had seen neither bodies nor wreckage.\\" In early August 1914, before Britain declared war on Germany in what was to become World War I, Laurentic sailed from Liverpool to Canada with her accommodations full of fleeing Europeans. On 13 September, while at Montr√©al, she was commissioned as a troop transport for the Canadian Expeditionary Force, painted grey, and reclassified as HMS Laurentic. Still captained by John Mathias, she joined a convoy of 32 ships that transported 35,000 Canadian soldiers to Europe in October 1914. She was then rapidly converted to an armed merchant cruiser (AMC) and fitted with eight 6-inch and two 6-pounder naval guns, returning to service on 31 October. In December 1914 she left Liverpool for Sierra Leone to assist in the Kamerun Campaign, and was involved mostly with the African theatre until the following summer. In August 1915 she left for Singapore and spent the ensuing months on patrol around Singapore, Rangoon, and Hong Kong. In June 1916 she left Asia en route to Halifax, Nova Scotia by way of Cape Town, and spent the following months patrolling near Halifax. Her patrol eventually moved southward to Bermuda, and then returned directly to Halifax in October. In late November she departed for Liverpool, carrying Royal Canadian Navy officers, rated seamen, and Royal Canadian Naval Volunteer Reserves. During the voyage, Captain Mathias was accidentally struck by a steel beam while attempting to extinguish a coal fire, and died on 4 December of a fractured skull, two days before reaching Liverpool. Sinking On 23 January 1917, Laurentic departed Liverpool en route to Halifax, under the command of Captain Reginald Norton. She carried some 479 passengers, mostly naval officers, ratings, and Naval Volunteer Reserves, as well as a secret cargo of gold which was to be used for the purchase of war munitions from Canada and the United States. On 25 January the ship made an unscheduled stop at the naval base in Buncrana, Ireland, to allow four passengers with yellow fever symptoms to disembark. The ship lifted anchor around sunset, moving toward Fanad Head, where she was to meet with a destroyer escort. The weather was bitterly cold and a blizzard affected visibility, but Captain Norton gave the order to proceed without the escort, despite reports that a German U-boat had been spotted in the area earlier. Less than an hour after leaving Buncrana, the ship struck two mines laid by the German mine-laying submarine off Lough Swilly. One of the mines exploded near the engine room, which left the ship without power and caused it to list 20 degrees; the combination of the darkness and list made it difficult to lower the lifeboats, and made it impossible for the ship to issue a distress call. Without power the main pumps were inoperable and the ship sank within an hour. Those who made it onto lifeboats faced extreme cold as low as . Survivors rowed towards Fanad Lighthouse, and some were rescued by local fishing trawlers. In the morning, many were found frozen to death in their lifeboats, with their hands still gripping the oars. The official count lists 475 passengers on board at the time of sinking, meaning that only 121 survived, and 354 were lost in the disaster. On 1 February, The New York Times reported that the last person to leave the ship was Captain Norton, who survived. He was quoted as saying: \\"To the best of my knowledge, all the men got safely into the boats. The best of order prevailed after the explosion. The officers and men lived up to the best traditions of the navy...The deaths were all due to exposure, owing to the coldness of the night. My own boat was almost full of water when we were picked up by a trawler the next morning, but all the men in the boat survived. Another boat, picked up at 3 o'clock in the afternoon, contained five survivors and fifteen frozen bodies. They had been exposed to the bitter cold for over twenty hours.\\" Bodies of the dead continued to wash up on shore for several weeks. Salvage In addition to her passengers and crew, the ship was carrying 3,211 gold ingots (about 43 tons) stowed in its second class baggage room. At the time the gold was valued at ¬£5 million (¬£ in ) and was intended to pay for war munitions. Royal Navy salvage divers led by Captain Guybon Chesney Castell Damant made over 5,000 dives to the wreck in 1917 and 1919 to 1924, recovering all but 25 of the ingots.Armstrong, R. - editor Treasure and Treasure Hunters Hamish Hamilton 1969 pp178-203 In 1934, three more ingots were recovered by a private salvage company and two more by the time that salvage company went bankrupt. Further attempts in the 1950s and 1980s recovered nothing. As of 2016, 20 bars of gold remain unaccounted for. The last of the gold recovered by the Royal Navy was some 10 metres (33.8 feet) under the sea bed, thus the remaining gold may be difficult to reach. The wreck lies about beneath the surface, and its salvage rights are privately owned. It is considered an official war grave under international law. In 2007, one of the deck guns was recovered and put on permanent display at Downings pier.

Prior to becoming Chief Justice, he was a lawyer and a High Court judge in Nigeria's Western Region. He was the first indigenous African to head the position of Chief Justice in Botswana. Throughout his legal career, he was known as a cerebral jurist and lawyer, who embraced radicalism especially during period of military rule in Nigeria. It is believed this may have resulted in his exclusion as a member of the supreme court of Nigeria.\\"Man In The News\\", The News, 26 October 1998. Early life and education Judge Aguda was born in Akure, Nigeria, to the family of Elijah Aguda and Deborah Fasu, a prominent Anglican couple in Akure. He studied at St David's Primary School, Akure, for primary education and left for the Government College, Ibadan for secondary education.\\"Aguda: Burying the Dead, Honouring the Living\\", Thisday, 19 October 2001. Originally, he wanted to be a doctor or an engineer but his mind was not quite into chemistry, a crucial subject necessary to pass medical school. He left medical school after the first year and tried teaching but on the advice of Obafemi Awolowo, he changed his mind and decided to enrol in a Law school. He studied Law at the University of London, and was called to the bar in 1952. Career After completing his studies, he entered private practice in the chambers of the distinguished Nigerian lawyer, Ayo Rosiji. but later transferred to the legal department of the western region of Nigeria, and became the Pupil Crown Counsel. Soon thereafter, he was made Crown Counsel in 1955 and in 1968, he became the acting solicitor general of the Western region. On 3 February 1972 he was appointed the first African Chief Justice of Botswana, concurrently, he was also a judge of the Court of Appeal of Swaziland, Botswana and Lesotho. After, leaving the supreme court in 1975, he returned to Nigeria and continued his judicial career as Chief Judge of Ondo State. In 1976, he was a leading member of the committee that recommended Abuja as the capital of Nigeria. He retired from civil service in 1978 and became the director of the newly created Nigerian Institute of Advanced Legal Studies at the University of Lagos. As director of the Nigerian Institute of Advanced Legal Studies, Aguda assumed a new role, as a critic of corruption and governance in Nigeria and Africa. To Aguda, the lack of thorough knowledge of judicial norms and precedents by the common African man or woman leads to the abuse of vital human rights by the government. A situation that can be fuelled by poverty, which allows many to rot in jails without due process or even a notice of trial as they do not have the money to get an astute lawyer or the connections to effect changes to their situation.Brendalyn P. Ambrose; Democratization and the Protection of Human Rights in Africa: Problems and Prospects, Praeger Publishers, 1995. His defence of the right of suspects was a crucial issue that was prominent during his days as a judge. In 1968, in the case of Agbaje vs the Western Government of Nigeria, he wrote a comment that is still relevant in today's Nigerian judicial system.Reuters AlertNet - NIGERIA: Human rights groups welcome UN spotlight on police torture He also sought for removal of economic barriers in the criminal justice system, concurrently with a speedy trial and to put omnipotent leaders under the law not above it. Personal life He married his first wife in 1952 and took on a mistress two years after.

He acquired effective power as ruler of Tibet by eliminating the regent (desi) Sangye Gyatso and the Sixth Dalai Lama, Tsangyang Gyatso, but his rule was cut short by an invasion by another group of Oirats, the Dzungar people. At length, this led to the direct involvement of the Chinese Qing Dynasty in the Tibetan politics. Rise to power Since the Khoshut invasion of Central Tibet in 1641-42, Tibet had been governed through a tripartite division of power. While the Dalai Lama was the supreme spiritual ruler, the Khoshut khan controlled the armed forces and carried the title of \\"Dharma king, Protector of the Faith\\". Executive power was delegated to a regent or desi who was originally a formal appointee of the Khoshut king. After 1655 the Khoshut kings were, however, rather weak figures who enabled the Fifth Dalai Lama to wield great personal influence. His death in 1682 was kept secret until 1697, and the desi Sangye Gyatso, rumoured to be a son of the Dalai Lama, governed Tibet. He entertained close contacts with Galdan Boshugtu Khan, the ruler of the emerging Dzungar Khanate of Inner Asia, with the aim of countering the role of the Khoshuts in Tibetan affairs. It was only in 1697 that the Sixth Dalai Lama was installed, to the great irritation of the Qing Kangxi Emperor who had been kept in the dark about the matter, and furthermore was an enemy of the Dzungar rulers. It was in this situation that Lha-bzang Khan came to power. According to the usual version of the events, Lha-bzang succeeded as Dharma king by poisoning his brother Vangjal (Tenzin Wangchuk Khan), who ruled in 1696-1697 or, more probably, in 1701-1703. According to an alternative study, he was peacefully enthroned on the recommendations of the Sixth Dalai Lama, since his brother was sickly. Before his enthronement he had lived his life in the nomadic area at the Kokonor Lake, and never visited Lhasa until 1701.Schwieger 2015, p. 116. The murder of the regent mongolian ou√Øghour script as Qoshots are Oirats. The Sixth Dalai Lama turned out to be a talented but boisterous young man who preferred poetry-writing and the company of young women to monastic life. In 1702 he renounced his monastic vows and returned to lay status but retained his temporal authority. In the next year Sangye Gyatso formally turned over the regent title to his son Ngawang Rinchen, but in fact kept the executive powers. Now, a rift emerged within the Tibetan elite. Lha-bzang was a man of character and energy who was not content with the effaced state in which the Khoshut royal power had sunk since the death of G√ºshi Khan. He set about to change this, probably after an attempt by Sangye Gyatso to poison the king and his chief minister. Matters came to their head during the Monlam Prayer Festival in Lhasa in 1705, which followed the Tibetan New Year (Losar). During a grand meeting with the clergy, Sangye Gyatso proposed to seize and execute Lha-bzang Khan. This was opposed by the cleric Jamyang Zhepa from the Drepung Monastery, the personal guru of Lha-bzang. Rather, the Dharma king was strongly recommended to leave for Kokonor (Qinghai), the usual abode of the Khoshut elite. He pretended to comply and started his journey to the north. However, when he reached the banks of the Nagchu River (north-east of Central Tibet), he halted and began to gather the Khoshut tribesmen. In the summer of 1705 he marched on Lhasa and divided his troops in three columns, one under his wife Tsering Tashi. When Sangye Gyatso heard about this he gathered the troops of Central Tibet, Ngari and Kham close to Lhasa. He offered battle but was badly defeated with the loss of 400 men. The Panchen Lama Lobsang Yeshe tried to mediate. Realizing that his situation was hopeless, Sangye Gyatso gave up resistance on condition that he was spared and was sent to Gonggar Dzong west of Lhasa. However, the vengeful queen Tsering Tashi arrested the ex-desi and brought him to the T√∂lung Valley where he was killed, probably on 6 September 1705. Qing influences and the question of the Dalai Lama With this feat Lha-bzang was acknowledged as king, gyalpo tripa. He also carried the courtesy title of Jingis Khan, and is usually known by that name among European visitors. His position was not entirely secure, and he resorted to some acts of violence; thus he killed the head of the Sera Ma College and flogged or imprisoned several persons in the Tsang region. Meanwhile, the Kangxi Emperor was eager to gain a degree of influence in Tibet, for the reason that the hostile Dzungar khans adhered to Tibetan Buddhism. If the Dzungar elite secured the support of the Dalai Lama it would affect the loyalty of the Mongols under Qing suzerainty. Lha-bzang Khan on his side looked for support with the Qing court and sent a report about the civil war of 1705 to the emperor, who approved his actions. As a reward for ridding him of his old enemy the desi, Kangxi appointed Lha-bzang Regent of Tibet () . The emperor considered the Sixth Dalai Lama to be spurious and asked Lha-bzang to send him to Beijing. The king realized the possible reaction among the Tibetan population which still largely adhered to the libertine hierarch, but finally resolved to comply with the request. Accounts differ as to whether the king was sincerely offended by the Sixth's scandalous behavior, or he merely used it as an excuse.Stein 1972, p. 85 He summoned a clerical meeting and asked the lamas to disavow the Dalai Lama as an incarnation of Avalokiteshvara. The lamas, however, refused to agree and stated that Tsangyang Gyatso was the true Dalai Lama in spite of his shocking behaviour. They did, however issue a declaration that the spiritual enlightenment no longer dwelt in the young man. The dethronement of the Dalai Lama Lha-bzang Khan now took action and brought out the Dalai Lama from the Potala Palace on 11 June 1706. Sixteen days later, he was declared deposed and was told of the emperor's order by the Chinese envoy. As he departed for Beijing, an angry crowd attacked the escort, freed the Dalai Lama and brought him to the Summer Palace at Drepung. The palace was soon surrounded by Khoshut troops and Dalai Lama let himself be taken to avoid a general massacre. Drepung was nevertheless stormed and sacked. The Dalai Lama was again sent towards the imperial court but died by the Kunga Nor Lake in Qinghai on 4 November. Rumours had it that he was murdered, but official accounts state that he died from illness. The king then found a monk from Kham, Ngawang Yeshe Gyatso, born in 1686, who was proclaimed the true reincarnation of the Fifth Dalai Lama (being a Seventh, according to Stein, or a new/real Sixth, according to SmithSmith 1997, p. 122 and Mullin). This person was in fact believed to be the son of Lha-bzang Khan himself. He was however enthroned without consulting with the religious authorities. Tibetans as well as Lha-bzang's Khoshut rivals strongly rejected the would-be Dalai Lama. Kangxi recognized Lhazang's choice, but hedged his bets considering the opposition from other Khoshuts and from the Tibetans. After some time a boy was discovered in Lithang in eastern Tibet who was believed to be the reincarnation of Tsangyang Gyatso. The boy, later known as Kelzang Gyatso was recognized by G√ºshi Khan's youngest son Tashi Batur (1632-1714) and another Khoshut prince called Amdowa. Kangxi showed interest for the boy although he did not recognize him yet. After 1715 he lived under imperial protection in Kumbum.Smith 1997, p. 123 The governance of Lha-bzang Khan A major calamity struck the country in 1709. Tsang and Toh (West Tibet) suffered a severe earthquake which destroyed houses and killed lots of people. The central authorities sent relief to the afflicted areas, but this was insufficient and several towns had to be abandoned.Shakabpa 1967, p. 134 In his foreign policy Lha-bzang had to cope with Chinese ambitions to turn his kingdom into a protectorate. The Manchu official Heshou was sent to Tibet in 1709 with the mission of supervising the king and watch against dissatisfied elements in society. Moreover, he collected geographical data used by European Jesuits in imperial service to draw accurate maps of the country. Nevertheless, the Qing commissioner was not supported by any Chinese troops, and was recalled in 1711. This left Lha-bzang Khan supreme in Tibet for the moment. A war with Bhutan broke out in 1714. Lha-bzang led the operations in person, invading Bhutan with three columns. However, he scored but limited success and soon withdrew the troops. The unsatisfactory result did not improve his standing in Tibet. The same may be said about his interest for the Catholic missionaries who visited Tibet in his reign, foremost among them Ippolito Desideri, whose anti-Buddhist rhetoric he sometimes seemed to endorse. In fact, Tibetan sources indicate that Lha-bzang was a pious Buddhist who had a good understanding of sutras and tantras. He built a new assembly hall at the Sera Monastery, moved the Urg√© College that his ancestor G√ºshi Khan had established in Dam, and supported a new tantric college. He favoured the various monastic schools without discrimination, in particular the dominating Gelugpa school.Shakabpa 2010, p. 410. In spite of such tokens of piety, the adverse attitude of the Buddhist clergy undermined his position. Dzungar invasion According to one version, a number of clerics and officials, resentful of Lha-bzang Khan's grab of power, sent a letter to the court of the Dzungar Khanate in western Mongolia, asking the ruler Tsewang Rabtan to avenge the death of Sangye Gyatso. This is somewhat doubtful, since a contemporary source makes clear that Tsewang Rabtan did not like the murdered desi.Shakabpa 2010, p, 414. More important were the strategical interests of the Dzungar elite. If they were able to conquer Tibet and place the boy Kelzang Gyatso on the throne of Lhasa, they might enlist the support of the Tibetans and Khoshuts in their enterprises against the Qing Empire. The parts of Mongolia under Manchu domination could then be attacked on two fronts, helped by the great authority of the Tibetan Buddhist institutions.Barfield 1992, p. 289. In 1714, Lha-bzang anyway received a message from Tsewang Rabtan. There were many marital connections between the Khoshut and Dzungar princes, and Tsewang Rabtan was married to Lha-bzang's sister.Adle and Habib 2003, p. 180. Now the Dzungar lord proposed that his daughter may marry Lha-bzang's son Ganden Tenzin. Lha-bzang consented in spite of some doubts about Dzungar intentions. However, when Ganden Tenzin arrived to the Dzungar lands to pick up his bride, he was seized and kept prisoner by Tsewang Rabtan.Shakabpa 1967, p. 134-5 After three years, in 1717, the Dzungar ruler appointed his brother Tsering Dondup to invade Tibet with an army of 7,000 cavalry, after having executed Ganden Tenzin. The horsemen did not take the usual route through the Kokonor region, but rather invaded via Yarkand and from there entered north-western Tibet. It was quite an astonishing feat which took the Khoshut regime by complete surprise. Death Lha-bzang Khan was staying in the Dam region when he heard about the unexpected invasion. At this time he was an old man, overweight and a heavy drinker.Van Schaik 2011, p. 139. His able officer Pholhane suggested the king guard the pass between Dam and Lhasa with musketeers, but Lha-bzang preferred to meet the enemy on the open plain. Meanwhile, Dzungar spies spread the word that they had come to avenge the death of Sangye Gyatso, return power over the country to the Tibetans themselves, and expel the \\"false\\" Dalai Lama Ngawang Yeshe Gyatso. This had effect. The troops of Lha-bzang were defeated and withdrew to Lhasa which was hastily put in a state of defence. The city was besieged by the Dzungars and eventually stormed on a dark night at the end of November. Treason helped the enterprise since ladders were dropped down the fortified walls. The king withdrew to the Potala after most of his loyal troops had been massacred. He then sent his other son Surya to fetch reinforcement in Kokonor, but the prince was captured by the invaders.Shakabpa 1967, p. 136 Seeing that everything was lost, the king rode out from Potala in the night of 3 December 1717 with a handful of followers, desperately trying to escape. However, his horse was stuck in the mud and fell down.Van Schaik 2001, p. 139. The fallen ruler engaged the pursuing enemy in fierce hand-to-hand combat. Eleven Dzungars fell by his hand before he was cut down. Meanwhile, a smaller Dzungar force of 300 attempted to retrieve Kelzang Gyatso from Kumbum, but was defeated by Kangxi's troops. The Dzungars, initially welcomed by the Tibetans amidst expectations that they would free them of Lha-bzang and enable the installation of Kelzang Gyatso, lost Tibetan goodwill quickly by looting Lhasa and persecuting the Nyingma.Smith 1997, p. 124 Glenn Mullin portrays Lha-bzang Khan as a pious man who cultivated Tibetan religious authorities in every way possible, who was nevertheless rejected by the Tibetans because he was the first foreigner in almost 500 years to rule Lhasa.Mullin 2001, pp. 274-5 He is described as \\"a most liberal prince, very enlightened, and broad-minded in matters of religion, extremely fond of foreigners, and an administrator of rare wisdom.\\"  References  = Citations = = Sources = * Adle, Chahryar, and Habib, Irfan (eds.).

Warner Books) Dinosaur Summer is a novel by Greg Bear, published in 1998. It is a modern sequel to Arthur Conan Doyle's 1912 novel The Lost World. Tony DiTerlizzi illustrated the book. Background The novel is set in an alternate history in which the events of The Lost World actually occurred. (However, the events of the original novel's sequel, The Poison Belt, which has a very different theme and treatment of characters, do not appear to have happened in the world of Dinosaur Summer.) The setting is based upon a large plateau (\\"El Grande\\" or \\"Tepui Grande\\") in Venezuela, where dinosaurs still live. Due to the capture and exhibition of dinosaurs, movie producers such as Willis O'Brien and Ray Harryhausen never succeed, since the public's interest is instead captured by living dinosaurs. However, due to deaths caused by escaped dinosaurs and difficulty in obtaining new dinosaurs, the dinosaur circuses slowly die out. The novel is set in 1947, shortly after the Second World War.  Plot  Peter Belzoni and his father Anthony Belzoni join an expedition to return the dinosaurs belonging to the last dinosaur circus to the plateau. To reach the plateau, the expedition must deal with the vagaries of politics. One dinosaur dies en route, but the remainder are released on the plateau. However, the expedition members are trapped on the plateau and must face, and escape from, dinosaurs both real and fictional.

Schl√∂ndorff and von Trotta wrote the script with an emphasis on the vindictive and harsh treatment of an innocent woman by the public, the police and the media. The film stars Angela Winkler as Blum, Mario Adorf as Kommissar Beizmenne, Dieter Laser as T√∂tges, and J√ºrgen Prochnow as Ludwig. The film and the novel were also adapted into an American TV film titled The Lost Honor of Kathryn Beck in 1984.  Plot Katharina Blum is an innocent woman who works as a housekeeper for a famous corporate lawyer, Hubert Blorna, and his wife Trude. Her life is ruined by an invasive tabloid reporter, Werner T√∂tges, who works for a tabloid simply known as The Paper. Katharina lands in the papers when the police begin to investigate her in connection with Ludwig G√∂tten, a man she has just met and quickly fallen in love with, and who is accused of being an anarchist, a bank robber, and an alleged terrorist. Police suspect Katharina of aiding and abetting G√∂tten. Throughout the film, Katharina's limits are tested, and her dignity, as well as her sanity, is on the line as she tries her best to make her voice heard and the truth known. After T√∂tges visits Katharina's mother, who is recovering from surgery in the hospital, her mother dies. Ludwig is captured; Katharina had allowed him to hide out at the country house of Alois Str√§ubleder, a political leader who was pursuing her romantically and had given her the key to his country villa. It turns out that Ludwig was not a bank robber but instead a deserter from the Bundeswehr who stole two regiments' pay. Unable to find justice for herself or make the negative press coverage stop, Katharina murders T√∂tges and his photographer. Katharina and Ludwig see each other once more, passionately clinging to each other as they pass in the basement of the prison where they are initially held. In an epilogue, at T√∂tges's funeral, his editor delivers a hypocritical speech about how his murder was an attack on democracy and the freedom of the press. The film's final image is a block of text that appears over T√∂tges's funeral wreath and casket, linking the film's depiction of The Paper's yellow journalism to the practices of actual German tabloid Bild-Zeitung. This text also appears at the beginning of Heinrich B√∂ll's book. It reads: > The characters and action in this story are purely fictitious. Should the > description of certain journalistic practices result in a resemblance to the > practices of Bild-Zeitung, such resemblance is neither intentional, nor > fortuitous, but unavoidable.

The film also presents a clear condemnation of collusion between the police and the yellow press. Unlike the novel, the film ends with a scene at T√∂tges' funeral, with his publisher delivering a hypocritical condemnation of the murder as an infringement on the freedom of the press. The film establishes its concern with the media in its opening scene, which follows a man (G√∂tten) who is being filmed and followed. Though she only spends one night with him, the police raid on Katharina's home, as well as her involvement with G√∂tten, immediately becomes a media spectacle. When Katharina is released because the police can‚Äôt find the evidence to hold her, she walks into an abundance of journalists pointing cameras at her and yelling questions at her. She tries to look away, but the police officer escorting her out grabs a fistful of her hair and makes her look into the flashing lights and curious faces. He claims they‚Äôre just doing their jobs and that she needs to respect that. The film represents the media as vindictive and scandal-obsessed. The Paper only publishes conspiracies and disregards the truth. The main reporter, T√∂tges, frequently makes up quotes and distorts facts to make Katharina's life fit a salacious narrative of a promiscuous woman who aids and abets anarchists and terrorists. It‚Äôs clear that the media doesn‚Äôt care if she is innocent or not. She is a story, and that is her only purpose to them. In interviews for the 2003 Criterion Collection DVD release of the film, Schl√∂ndorff and other crew members argue for the film's continued relevance today, drawing an analogy between the political climate of panic over terrorism in 1970s West Germany and the post-September 11, 2001 situation in the U.S. where unsubstantiated media hype was used to launch the invasion of Iraq.The Lost Honour of Katharina Blum (Film, 1975) Historical context Following the kidnapping and execution of a West German Corporate leader, Hanns Martin Schleyer and several other prison deaths, The Lost Honour of Katharina Blum is a reflection of the conflicts in West Germany during the 1960s and '70s, a time where student movements and a political struggle were occurring. Militant terrorists such as the Red Army Faction (the Baader-Meinhof Group) had holds in the government and it didn‚Äôt take long for their violent tendencies to make citizens questionable toward their governments as reforms began to turn into repressions. Some of these repressions resulted in brutal and destructive consequences, which the film blatantly opposes. Terrorism was confused with radicalism and fear was present in almost all citizens because of the political reforms and repressions the country had undergone. This was a time period in which media coverage was expanding and journalism was becoming one of the biggest careers to have. Journalists were ruthless in their digging to come up with a story, as reflected in the film. Police were not afraid to become violent, whether it is emotional or physical. Witnesses and suspects seldom had a voice. Some of the topics the film explores are the vindictive nature of the media and police, as well as the abuse of power, discrimination, and emotional abuse.

Fort Rock Cave featured numerous well-preserved sagebrush sandals, ranging from 9,000 to 13,000 years old. The cave is located approximately west of Fort Rock near Fort Rock State Natural Area in Lake County. Fort Rock Cave was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1961, and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1966.. The cave was found on Reub Long's ranch. It was formerly known as Menkenmaier Cave and Cow Cave. Archaeology Fort Rock sandals on display at the Oregon Historical Society University of Oregon archaeologist Luther Cressman's 1938 excavations at Fort Rock Cave placed human habitation in Oregon as early as 13,200 years ago. Cressman's team also recovered numerous examples of sandals woven from sagebrush bark below a layer of Mazama Ash (deposited by the explosion forming Crater Lake about 7600 years ago). Radiocarbon dating of these sandals, now displayed at the University of Oregon Museum of Natural and Cultural History in Eugene and in the town of Fort Rock, has shown some to be over 10,000 years old. This sandal style is known as Fort Rock style, since they were first discovered there. This sandal style is distinct from other variants; they are flat, closed toed and have a twined sole. They have been found at other sites, such as Cougar Mountain and Catlow Caves, as well. Several other prehistoric artifacts have been found at Fort Rock Cave, including basketry and stone tools.

The CFA has review (but not approval) authority over the \\"design and aesthetics\\" of all construction within Washington, D.C. In accordance with the Old Georgetown Act, the CFA appoints the Old Georgetown Board. The Old Georgetown Board has design review authority over all semipublic and private structures within the boundaries of the Georgetown Historic District. The CFA was granted approval (not just review) authority by the Shipstead-Luce Act over the design and height of public and private buildings which front or abut the grounds of the United States Capitol, the grounds of the White House, Pennsylvania Avenue NW extending from the Capitol to the White House, Lafayette Square, Rock Creek Park, the National Zoological Park, the Rock Creek and Potomac Parkway, Potomac Park, and the National Mall and its constituent parks.Gutheim and Lee, p. 208; Kohler, The Commission of Fine Arts: A Brief History, 1910‚Äì1995, p. 244. The CFA mandate does not apply to the United States Capitol, the Library of Congress, or the other properties and locations overseen by the Architect of the Capitol. Formation of the CFA President George Washington granted the government of the District of Columbia the power to regulate architectural design and urban planning. These powers were suspended by President James Monroe in 1822. In the wake of the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893, the Cosmos Club and American Institute of Architects formed the Public Art League, a new organization whose purpose was to lobby for a new agency of the federal government to approve the design or purchase of art and architecture by the federal government. Legislation was proposed in Congress in 1897, but failed to pass because members of Congress wanted an advisory board rather than one which could deny Congress the ability to award commissions as part of the spoils system.Kohler, The Commission of Fine Arts: A Brief History, 1910‚Äì1995, p. 1. In 1900, the United States Congress created the Senate Park Commission (also known as the \\"McMillan Commission\\" for its chairman, Senator James McMillan (R-MI)) to reconcile competing visions for the development of Washington, D.C. and especially the National Mall and nearby areas.Peterson, p. 77-91. The commission's plan for development of the city, popularly known as the McMillan Plan, proposed the razing of all residences and other buildings on Lafayette Square and building tall, Neoclassical government office buildings with facades of white marble around the square to house executive branch offices.Peterson, p. 94. It also proposed clearing large spaces north and south of the National Mall, realigning some streets, and constructing major new museums and public buildings along the Mall's length.Bednar, p. 49-51. The commission also proposed significant expansion of the district's park system, the creation of a system of parkways, and extensive renovation and beautification of existing parks.Davis, p. 137-180. Over the next few years, the President and Congress established several new agencies to supervise the approval, design, and construction of new buildings in the District of Columbia to carry out the McMillan Plan: The Commission of Fine Arts in 1910 to review and advise on the design of new structures, the Public Buildings Commission in 1916 to make recommendations regarding the construction of buildings to house federal agencies and offices, and the National Capital Parks and Planning Commission in 1924 to oversee planning for the District.Cannadine, p. 373-374. On January 11, 1909, a committee of the American Institute of Architects (AIA) asked President Theodore Roosevelt to establish an independent federal agency to advise the government on architecture, bridges, painting, parks, sculpture, and other artistic works requiring design. Roosevelt wrote back the same day, agreeing to the proposal.Kohler, The Commission of Fine Arts: A Brief History, 1910‚Äì1995, p. 2. On January 19, 1909, Roosevelt issued Executive Order 1010, establishing a Council of Fine Arts. He requested that the AIA name 30 individuals to the council, and he instructed the Cabinet to seek the council's advice in matters of architecture, building site selection, landscaping, painting, and sculpture.Kohler, The Commission of Fine Arts: A Brief History, 1910‚Äì1995, p. 2-3. The Council met only once, on February 9, 1909,Charles Moore, CFA chairman from 1912 to 1915, puts the date of the meeting at February 10, 1909, but the Washington Post reported on February 10, 1909, that the council had met the previous day..

Historians Sue Kohler and Christopher Thomas state that Taft supported the idea of a fine arts commission, but wanted it to have a basis in legislation.Thomas, p. 36. But a contemporary report in the Washington Post noted that the council was highly controversial, and Congress had passed legislation prohibiting the expenditure of funds for any federal body not established by law. The newspaper said the legislation was intended to defund the Council of Fine Arts.\\"Art Council No More.\\" Washington Post. May 27, 1909. Later in 1909, Senator Elihu Root (R-NY) drafted legislation establishing an advisory commission of fine arts. Representative Samuel W. McCall (R-MA) introduced the bill, H.R. 19962, into the United States House of Representatives.\\"Commission of Fine Arts.\\" p. 251-253. Accessed 2012-10-13. The House passed the legislation on February 9, 1910. The House bill made the members of the commission subject to approval by the Senate, gave their term of office as four years, and their qualifications as artists \\"of repute\\". In addition to having an advisory capacity on all questions of art and design, the commission was given final say on the selection of sites for monuments and statues.\\"Art Board for District.\\" Washington Post. February 10, 1910. Root managed the House bill through the Senate. Speaker Joseph Gurney Cannon opposed the bill, and it was bottled up the Committee on the Library. But in mid-March, a group of renegade Republicans joined forces with Democrats to strip Speaker Cannon of much of his power. The fine arts commission bill quickly passed through the committee and was brought up for a vote on the Senate floor. The Senate amended the bill, and passed it on May 3, 1910. One amendment, to bar statues of any person not dead 50 years, was turned down.\\"Senators As Art Critics.\\" Washington Post. May 4, 1910. The Senate changed the qualifications of the commissioners to seven \\"well qualified judges of the fine arts\\". It struck the commission's authority to site monuments and statues, making the authority advisory only. It also added fountains to the type of items covered by the act. In a conference committee on May 9, the House conferees agreed to the Senate amendments. They also won approval of the Senate conferees to remove the requirement that the commission members be approved by the Senate. Clarifying language was also added to the bill, permitting the commission to advise (upon request) on the U.S. Capitol and Library of Congress buildings. H.R. 19962, as amended, was passed by the House on May 12, and the Senate on May 17.American Federation of Arts, p. 97; Joint Committee on the Library, p. 56. Accessed 2012-10-13. Taft signed the legislation Public Law 61-181 (40 U.S.C. 104, 36 Stat. 371), shortly thereafter. President Taft named the seven members of the commission on June 13, 1910.\\"Art Experts Chosen.\\" Washington Post. June 14, 1910. Taft appointed architect Daniel Burnham to be the chairman.Moore, p. 122-123. The 1910 legislation establishing the CFA gave the commission the power to only provide advice on the siting of monuments and memorials. In October 1910, President William Howard Taft issued Executive Order 1259 (October 25, 1910), which required that all new public buildings erected in the District of Columbia be reviewed by the CFA as well.Resnik and Curtis, p. 488, fn. 125. On November 28, 1913, President Woodrow Wilson issued Executive Order 1862, which expanded the CFA's advisory authority to cover any \\"new structures...which affect in any important way the appearance of the City, or whenever questions involving matters of art and with which the federal government is concerned...\\"Kohler, The Commission of Fine Arts: A Brief History, 1910‚Äì1995, p. 204. Executive Order 3524, issued by President Warren G. Harding on July 28, 1921, further expanded the CFA's review to the design of coins, fountains, insignia, medals, monuments, parks, and statues, whether constructed or issued by the federal government or the government of the District of Columbia.

It is currently the issue tracker for the Python programming language itself.Python Bug Tracker It was once described as \\"like Bugzilla without the six years of training, or RT without that tedious MySQL rubbish.\\"NTKnow 2002/07/05 - TRACKING  Features  The standard configuration of Roundup features: * a web interface for viewing, editing and searching issues * a Mail gateway allowing creation and changing of issuesE-Mail User Interface, Roundup design description * a database abstraction layer, currently supporting (among others) Python's built-in \\"anydbm\\" module, PostgreSQL, MySQL and SQLite * issue-specific \\"nosy lists\\", used for e-mail notifications and conversation (each issue effectively becoming a mini mailing list) Design of Nosy Lists * an authorization system,access control, Roundup design description based on roles (of users), classes and objects * an interactive shell for backup and restore tasks and for manipulation of objects Roundup supports several web backends.http://roundup.sourceforge.net/docs/installation.html#configure-a- web-interface It can be run standalone, as a background daemon process, as a CGI scriptusage via CGI is rare and not recommended, for performance reasons or as WSGI application.  Concepts  Roundup is customized by changing the contents of the tracker instance directory: = Database schema = The database schema is defined in a Python file in the tracker instance's root directory; it is re-read whenever the server is started anew. When changes are found (e.g. new attributes), the tables of the underlying RDBS are altered accordingly. = Page templates = Roundup uses the Template Attribute Language (TAL) to create HTML or XHTML output. Version 1.5.0 adds experimental support for alternative template engines, such as Jinja2.https://pypi.python.org/pypi/roundup/1.5.0 Templates are named after the classes in database. Roundup automatically chooses template based on class name requested from URL. Some templates are used for several classes, e.g. _generic.index.html, which allows (authorized) users to change the objects of all classes which lack an own index template. When an \\"issue123\\" is requested, this designator is split in the issue class and the id \\"123\\".identifiers and designators, Roundup design description By default an \\"item\\" template is chosen: First, an issue.item.html template file is looked for; if it can't be found, _generic.item.html is used as a fallback option. If this is missing equally, an error occurs. = Detectors = Many Roundup functions, including some of the standard functionality, are implemented using so-called detectors,detector interface, Roundup design description which are located in the \\"detectors\\" sub-directory of the tracker instance. They are Python subroutines which have access to the object to change (if already created) and the requested attribute changes. Detectors are distinguished between auditors and reactors. Auditors are used primarily for several automatic changes (in the standard configuration, the assignedto user is automagically added to the nosy list of the issue), and to refuse un-allowed changes; reactors are executed thereafter and used e.g. for the e-mail notification feature, sending notification mails to all users interested in a certain issue when a comment is added to it. Detectors are triggered whenever one of the actions * create * set (change of attributes) * retire * restore is requested. They can be used to create an elaborated custom workflow. = Extensions = The instance subdirectory \\"extensions\\" can hold additional files which are needed for extended functionalities which can't (conveniently) be done with TAL; even totally new actions are possible. Python modules which are used by both detectors and extensions can be put in the \\"lib\\" subdirectory  See also  * Comparison of issue-tracking systems References  External links  * Category:Bug and issue tracking software Category:Free project management software Category:Free software programmed in Python Category:Software using the MIT license Category:Web applications Category:Python (programming language) software ","title":"Roundup (issue tracker)"},{"id":"10567076","text":"Ubashi Kahn, 1744-1774, Oil painting, Reiss Museum Mannheim, Germany Ubashi Khan (Mongolian: ;Chinese: ; 1744~1774) was a Torghut-Kalmyk prince and the last Khan of the Kalmyk Khanate. In January 1771, he led the return migration of the majority of the Kalmyk people from the Kalmyk steppe to Dzungaria, their ancestral homeland, then under the control of the Qing Dynasty.Perdue 2009, p. 295. Biography Ubashi Khan was the great-grandson of Ayuka Khan. When he decided to return his people to Dzungaria, the Dalai Lama was contacted to request his blessing and to set the date of departure. After consulting the astrological chart, the Dalai Lama set the return date, but at the moment of departure, the weakening of the ice on the Volga River permitted only those Kalmyks who roamed on the left or eastern bank to leave. Those on the right bank were forced to stay behind. Under Ubashi Khan's leadership, approximately 200,000 Kalmyks began the journey from their pastures on the left bank of the Volga River to Dzungaria. Approximately five-sixths of the Torghut tribe followed Ubashi Khan. Most of the Khoshuts, Choros and Khoits also accompanied the Torghuts on their journey to Dzungaria. The D√∂rbet tribe, by contrast, elected not to go at all. The Kalmyks who resettled in Qing territory became known as Torghuts. While the first phase of their movement became the Old Torghuts, the Qing called the later Torghut immigrants \\"New Torghut\\". The size of the departing group has been variously estimated between 150,000 and 400,000 people, with perhaps as many as six million animals (cattle, sheep, horses, camels and dogs).DeFrancis, John. In the Footsteps of Genghis Khan. University of Hawaii Press, 1993. Beset by raids, thirst and starvation, approximately 85,000 survivors made it to Dzungaria, where they settled near the Ejin River with the permission of the Qing Manchu Emperor. The Torghuts were coerced by the Qing into giving up their nomadic lifestyle and to take up sedentary agriculture instead as part of a deliberate policy by the Qing to enfeeble them. They proved to be incompetent farmers and they became destitute, selling their children into slavery, engaging in prostitution, and stealing, according to the Manchu Qi-yi-shi.Dunnell 2004, p. 103.Millward 1998, p. 139. Child slaves were in demand on the Central Asian slave market, and Torghut children were sold into this slave trade.Millward 1998, p. 305. After failing to stop the flight, Catherine the Great abolished the Kalmyk Khanate, and the title of Khan, making Ubashi Khan the last to hold this title.

It is centred on Tieke Marae, a converted Department of Conservation tramping hut. The surrounding land is subject to a MƒÅori land claim which began with occupation of the hut in 1993. History =Pre-European and early 20th Century= Prior to European colonisation, Tieke was a trading centre on the Whanganui River as well as a place of learning and a fortified pƒÅ. In 1841 Tieke was described by Wakefield as a large settlement (perhaps 80‚Äì90 inhabitants); in the 1840s it shifted across the river and changed its name to Te Ririatepo, but by 1851 it had shifted back and was known as Okirihau, with a population of 93. The area was part of the government's 1886 Waimarino Purchase intended to allow sale of land to settlers, and the chief Te Rangihuatau who lived at Tieke assisted with the purchase. However, there was confusion over whether Tieke itself was included. Te Rangihuatau considered it to be MƒÅori land, the government considered it ‚ÄúCrown Lands which the Natives are allowed to use and occupy without a title‚Äù. Early in the 20th century the land changed from tribal to government ownership, although no official records of the 1906 Whanganui River Trust transaction exist today. In 1908 Te Rangihuatau died and the marae was abandoned.Parnell, Jim. (2005) Tieke. Whanganui RIver. Retrieved April 9, 2007 =Recent land claim and occupation= The land surrounding Tieke became scenic reserve, and then part of the Whanganui National Park when it was created in 1986. As part of the series of facilities they provided along the river, the Department of Conservation built a large hut at Tieke. In the mid-1990s the Department of Conservation began levying a Facilities Use Pass, a toll on river users to maintain its huts and services, which caused controversy amongst some local MƒÅori. In September 1993 a group called Te WhƒÅnau o Tieke MƒÅori reclaimed the land, occupying the hut and converting it into a marae.Young, David. (22 September 2012).

Retrieved 3 Dec 2015 Current inhabitants Today Tieke KƒÅinga is home to an extended family, Te WhƒÅnau o Tieke, also known as Tamahaki after the name of their common ancestor, whose members trace their ancestry to pre-European Tieke. They claim membership of the iwi NgƒÅ Rauru. However, the marae also serves as a popular stop-off point for tourists canoeing the Whanganui River (part of the Whanganui Journey). Another camping site, Ramanui, sits nearby on the opposite bank of the river. Whilst the land is still formally disputed, the Department of Conservation and the Te WhƒÅnau o Tieke MƒÅori have developed an amicable and co-operative relationship, working together to upgrade and maintain facilities at Tieke KƒÅinga.

It came into being as part of Saint Mary's College of California, founded in 1863 by the Catholic Church, and put under the auspices of the Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools in 1868. History In 1853, Joseph Sadoc Alemany was named Archbishop of San Francisco and immediately began to work to strengthen the fledgling system of Catholic education that existed at the time. Among his goals was the establishment of an educational institution for young men with an eye to fostering a home-grown clergy he felt was necessary for the survival of the Church in California. On July 9, 1863, Alemany dedicated the new Saint Mary's College at the end of Old Mission Road in San Francisco near the Mission Dolores. = Early years (1868-1927) = The school was established in 1863 to provide a grammar school, high school, and college, for young men. It struggled in its first few years and nearly closed in 1868, when the school's management was taken over by eight Christian Brothers, lead by Brother Justin McMahon. The Brothers faced formidable difficulties, including financial problems, poor teaching conditions, low enrollment, an earthquake, and an outbreak of smallpox. However, their efforts proved successful. Enrollment increased from 30 to 240 by 1875, and it soon became California's largest educational institution. The grammar school was relocated to the St. Joseph's Academy in Oakland in 1970. Most students boarded at the college, given its four-mile (6 km) distance from the heart of the city. Board and tuition cost $250 per year; day students paid $60. In 1870, to allow for expansion of the high school and college departments, the Brothers relocated the grammar school from Mission Road to their new St. Joseph's Academy in Oakland. The San Francisco campus for both the college and high school departments was replaced in 1889 with a new building called \\"The Brickpile\\". There were severe fires in 1894 and 1918, which lead to reconstruction. By 1900, tuition and board was $400/year. In 1927 the high school moved to its current location in Peralta Park and was renamed to Saint Mary's College High School. When school began in August 1927, newly constructed De La Salle Hall housed classrooms, dorm rooms, a chapel, offices, and the school cafeteria, and could accommodate 500 students, including 250 boarders. File:Peralta park.map1890.jpg File:PeraltaParkHotel BerkeleyCalifornia 1889.jpg File:Peralta park hotel, berkeley, california.jpg =Campus growth (1928-2006)= When school began in August 1927, newly constructed De La Salle Hall housed classrooms, dorm rooms, a chapel, offices, and the school cafeteria, and could accommodate 500 students, including 250 boarders. In 1946, a spectacular fire claimed the top two floors of the massive Academy and in 1959 the entire building was razed. Grammar school boarders moved into De La Salle Hall and attended classes in the new Cronin Hall. Older resident students made a home in St. Joseph's Hall (1956), which also housed the school library. Enrollment in 1966 saw 180 Academy students and 611 in the high school. The Academy ultimately moved to Mont La Salle in Napa in 1969 and closed completely in the early 1980s. The last high school boarder graduated from Saint Mary's in 1971. That year, the student population numbered 507. Beloved De La Salle Hall was razed in 1973 as an earthquake hazard. Brother Norman Cook, who taught at the Academy from 1952 to 1959, returned to Berkeley as Saint Mary's Principal in 1973. It was a difficult time for the school; enrollment was declining, De La Salle Hall was gone, leaving minimal facilities to accommodate 475 students. The Brothers lived in Vellesian Hall, and Saint Joseph's Hall began its virtually annual metamorphosis to meet school needs. In his assignment to Saint Mary's, Brother Norman had been given a mandate to ‚Äúclose it up or build it up!‚Äù The school community chose transformation. ‚ÄúThe possible demise of Saint Mary‚Äôs and its embodiment of the Lasallian vision,‚Äù Brother Norman reflected years later, ‚Äúwas simply an unacceptable option.‚Äù Work began on a facilities master plan and a major fundraising campaign. The Shea Student Center was completed in 1977 and the Brothers Residence in 1978. A later campaign funded the 1986 construction of science and math classrooms in Murphy Hall. Though campus facilities improved, enrollment steadily declined, reaching a low of about 375 in 1993. The closure of Berkeley's Presentation High for girls added impetus to Saint Mary's consideration of coeducation. In 1995, the gymnasium extension and new auditorium theater were completed as part of the school's Sharing the Spirit transition to coeducation. In August 1995, after 132 years as an all- male school, a 55/45 percent mix of young men and women entered the freshman class, and twenty-two sophomore girls joined ninety-eight male classmates. At commencement exercises on May 31, 1998, graduates spoke of the initial anxiety and apprehension that had given way to achievements and friendships which ultimately united them as Saint Mary's first coed graduating class. As Saint Mary's marked its 75th year on the Berkeley campus in 2002, Frates Memorial Hall opened, providing eight new classrooms and an amphitheater, gift of Dr. and Mrs. Frank E. Frates Jr., Class of 1927, and donors to the school's successful Creating Futures campaign for the new building and tuition assistance endowment funds. Over four summers beginning in 2011, the 1952 Cronin Hall classroom building was gutted and retrofitted; work was completed in 2014. That November, the new classroom building was blessed and renamed Brennan Hall. In 2015, the design for Saint Mary's Student Chapel was approved. Ground was broken in Summer 2016, and work on the chapel site got underway. It is expected construction will be completed early in 2018. In August 2017, Saint Mary's marked 90 years on the Peralta Park campus.

The water may be in the ocean, a lake, a river or a tank. Typical frequencies associated with underwater acoustics are between 10 Hz and 1 MHz. The propagation of sound in the ocean at frequencies lower than 10 Hz is usually not possible without penetrating deep into the seabed, whereas frequencies above 1 MHz are rarely used because they are absorbed very quickly. Underwater acoustics is sometimes known as hydroacoustics. The field of underwater acoustics is closely related to a number of other fields of acoustic study, including sonar, transduction, acoustic signal processing, acoustical oceanography, bioacoustics, and physical acoustics. History seafloor map produced by multibeam sonar Underwater sound has probably been used by marine animals for millions of years. The science of underwater acoustics began in 1490, when Leonardo da Vinci wrote the following,Urick, Robert J. Principles of Underwater Sound, 3rd Edition. New York. McGraw-Hill, 1983. :\\"If you cause your ship to stop and place the head of a long tube in the water and place the outer extremity to your ear, you will hear ships at a great distance from you.\\" In 1687 Isaac Newton wrote his Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy which included the first mathematical treatment of sound. The next major step in the development of underwater acoustics was made by Daniel Colladon, a Swiss physicist, and Charles Sturm, a French mathematician. In 1826, on Lake Geneva, they measured the elapsed time between a flash of light and the sound of a submerged ship's bell heard using an underwater listening horn.C. S. Clay & H. Medwin, Acoustical Oceanography (Wiley, New York, 1977) They measured a sound speed of 1435 metres per second over a 17 kilometre(Km) distance, providing the first quantitative measurement of sound speed in water.Annales de Chimie et de Physique 36 [2] 236 (1827) The result they obtained was within about 2% of currently accepted values. In 1877 Lord Rayleigh wrote the Theory of Sound and established modern acoustic theory. The sinking of Titanic in 1912 and the start of World War I provided the impetus for the next wave of progress in underwater acoustics. Systems for detecting icebergs and U-boats were developed. Between 1912 and 1914, a number of echolocation patents were granted in Europe and the U.S., culminating in Reginald A. Fessenden's echo- ranger in 1914. Pioneering work was carried out during this time in France by Paul Langevin and in Britain by A B Wood and associates.A. B. Wood, From the Board of Invention and Research to the Royal Naval Scientific Service, Journal of the Royal Naval Scientific Service Vol 20, No 4, pp 1‚Äì100 (185‚Äì284). The development of both active ASDIC and passive sonar (SOund Navigation And Ranging) proceeded apace during the war, driven by the first large scale deployments of submarines. Other advances in underwater acoustics included the development of acoustic mines. In 1919, the first scientific paper on underwater acoustics was published, theoretically describing the refraction of sound waves produced by temperature and salinity gradients in the ocean. The range predictions of the paper were experimentally validated by propagation loss measurements. The next two decades saw the development of several applications of underwater acoustics. The fathometer, or depth sounder, was developed commercially during the 1920s. Originally natural materials were used for the transducers, but by the 1930s sonar systems incorporating piezoelectric transducers made from synthetic materials were being used for passive listening systems and for active echo-ranging systems. These systems were used to good effect during World War II by both submarines and anti- submarine vessels. Many advances in underwater acoustics were made which were summarised later in the series Physics of Sound in the Sea, published in 1946. After World War II, the development of sonar systems was driven largely by the Cold War, resulting in advances in the theoretical and practical understanding of underwater acoustics, aided by computer-based techniques. Theory =Sound waves in water, bottom of sea= A sound wave propagating underwater consists of alternating compressions and rarefactions of the water. These compressions and rarefactions are detected by a receiver, such as the human ear or a hydrophone, as changes in pressure. These waves may be man-made or naturally generated. =Speed of sound, density and impedance= The speed of sound c \\\\, (i.e., the longitudinal motion of wavefronts) is related to frequency f \\\\, and wavelength \\\\lambda \\\\, of a wave by c = f \\\\cdot \\\\lambda. This is different from the particle velocity u \\\\,, which refers to the motion of molecules in the medium due to the sound, and relates the plane wave pressure p \\\\, to the fluid density \\\\rho \\\\, and sound speed c \\\\, by p = c \\\\cdot u \\\\cdot \\\\rho. The product of c and \\\\rho \\\\, from the above formula is known as the characteristic acoustic impedance. The acoustic power (energy per second) crossing unit area is known as the intensity of the wave and for a plane wave the average intensity is given by I = q^2/(\\\\rho c) \\\\,, where q \\\\, is the root mean square acoustic pressure. At 1 kHz, the wavelength in water is about 1.5 m. Sometimes the term \\"sound velocity\\" is used but this is incorrect as the quantity is a scalar. The large impedance contrast between air and water (the ratio is about 3600) and the scale of surface roughness means that the sea surface behaves as an almost perfect reflector of sound at frequencies below 1 kHz. Sound speed in water exceeds that in air by a factor of 4.4 and the density ratio is about 820. =Absorption of sound= Absorption of low frequency sound is weak.R. E. Francois & G. R. Garrison, Sound absorption based on ocean measurements. Part II: Boric acid contribution and equation for total absorption, J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 72, 1879‚Äì1890 (1982). (see Technical Guides ‚Äì Calculation of absorption of sound in seawater for an on-line calculator). The main cause of sound attenuation in fresh water, and at high frequency in sea water (above 100 kHz) is viscosity. Important additional contributions at lower frequency in seawater are associated with the ionic relaxation of boric acid (up to c. 10 kHz) and magnesium sulfate (c. 10 kHz-100 kHz).R. E. Francois and G. R. Garrison, Sound absorption based on ocean measurements. Part I: Pure water and magnesium sulfate contributions, J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 72, 896‚Äì907 (1982). Sound may be absorbed by losses at the fluid boundaries. Near the surface of the sea losses can occur in a bubble layer or in ice, while at the bottom sound can penetrate into the sediment and be absorbed. =Sound reflection and scattering= Boundary interactions Both the water surface and bottom are reflecting and scattering boundaries. =Surface= For many purposes the sea-air surface can be thought of as a perfect reflector. The impedance contrast is so great that little energy is able to cross this boundary. Acoustic pressure waves reflected from the sea surface experience a reversal in phase, often stated as either a ‚Äúpi phase change‚Äù or a ‚Äú180 deg phase change‚Äù. This is represented mathematically by assigning a reflection coefficient of minus 1 instead of plus one to the sea surface.Ainslie, M. A. (2010). Principles of Sonar Performance Modeling. Berlin: Springer. p36 At high frequency (above about 1 kHz) or when the sea is rough, some of the incident sound is scattered, and this is taken into account by assigning a reflection coefficient whose magnitude is less than one. For example, close to normal incidence, the reflection coefficient becomes R=-e^{-2 k^{2} h^{2} sin^2A}, where h is the rms wave height.H. Medwin & C. S. Clay, Fundamentals of Acoustical Oceanography (Academic, Boston, 1998). A further complication is the presence of wind generated bubbles or fish close to the sea surface.D. E. Weston & P. A. Ching, Wind effects in shallow-water transmission, J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 86, 1530‚Äì1545 (1989). The bubbles can also form plumes that absorb some of the incident and scattered sound, and scatter some of the sound themselves.G. V. Norton & J. C. Novarini, On the relative role of sea-surface roughness and bubble plumes in shallow-water propagation in the low-kilohertz region, J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 110, 2946‚Äì2955 (2001) =Seabed= The acoustic impedance mismatch between water and the bottom is generally much less than at the surface and is more complex. It depends on the bottom material types and depth of the layers. Theories have been developed for predicting the sound propagation in the bottom in this case, for example by Biot N Chotiros, Biot Model of Sound Propagation in Water Saturated Sand. J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 97, 199 (1995) and by Buckingham.M. J. Buckingham, Wave propagation, stress relaxation, and grain-to-grain shearing in saturated, unconsolidated marine sediments, J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 108, 2796‚Äì2815 (2000). At target The reflection of sound at a target whose dimensions are large compared with the acoustic wavelength depends on its size and shape as well as the impedance of the target relative to that of water. Formulae have been developed for the target strength of various simple shapes as a function of angle of sound incidence. More complex shapes may be approximated by combining these simple ones. =Propagation of sound= Underwater acoustic propagation depends on many factors. The direction of sound propagation is determined by the sound speed gradients in the water. These speed gradients transform the sound wave through refraction, reflection, and dispersion. In the sea the vertical gradients are generally much larger than the horizontal ones. Combining this with a tendency towards increasing sound speed at increasing depth, due to the increasing pressure in the deep sea, causes a reversal of the sound speed gradient in the thermocline, creating an efficient waveguide at the depth, corresponding to the minimum sound speed. The sound speed profile may cause regions of low sound intensity called \\"Shadow Zones\\", and regions of high intensity called \\"Caustics\\". These may be found by ray tracing methods. At equator and temperate latitudes in the ocean, the surface temperature is high enough to reverse the pressure effect, such that a sound speed minimum occurs at depth of a few hundred meters. The presence of this minimum creates a special channel known as Deep Sound Channel, previously known as the SOFAR (sound fixing and ranging) channel, permitting guided propagation of underwater sound for thousands of kilometers without interaction with the sea surface or the seabed. Another phenomenon in the deep sea is the formation of sound focusing areas, known as Convergence Zones. In this case sound is refracted downward from a near-surface source and then back up again. The horizontal distance from the source at which this occurs depends on the positive and negative sound speed gradients. A surface duct can also occur in both deep and moderately shallow water when there is upward refraction, for example due to cold surface temperatures. Propagation is by repeated sound bounces off the surface. In general, as sound propagates underwater there is a reduction in the sound intensity over increasing ranges, though in some circumstances a gain can be obtained due to focusing. Propagation loss (sometimes referred to as transmission loss) is a quantitative measure of the reduction in sound intensity between two points, normally the sound source and a distant receiver. If I_s is the far field intensity of the source referred to a point 1 m from its acoustic center and I_r is the intensity at the receiver, then the propagation loss is given by PL=10\\\\log (I_s/I_r). In this equation I_r is not the true acoustic intensity at the receiver, which is a vector quantity, but a scalar equal to the equivalent plane wave intensity (EPWI) of the sound field. The EPWI is defined as the magnitude of the intensity of a plane wave of the same RMS pressure as the true acoustic field. At short range the propagation loss is dominated by spreading while at long range it is dominated by absorption and/or scattering losses. An alternative definition is possible in terms of pressure instead of intensity, giving PL=20 \\\\log (p_s/p_r), where p_s is the RMS acoustic pressure in the far-field of the projector, scaled to a standard distance of 1 m, and p_r is the RMS pressure at the receiver position. These two definitions are not exactly equivalent because the characteristic impedance at the receiver may be different from that at the source. Because of this, the use of the intensity definition leads to a different sonar equation to the definition based on a pressure ratio.M. A. Ainslie, The sonar equation and the definitions of propagation loss, J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 115, 131‚Äì134 (2004). If the source and receiver are both in water, the difference is small. Propagation modelling The propagation of sound through water is described by the wave equation, with appropriate boundary conditions. A number of models have been developed to simplify propagation calculations. These models include ray theory, normal mode solutions, and parabolic equation simplifications of the wave equation.F. B. Jensen, W. A. Kuperman, M. B. Porter & H. Schmidt, Computational Ocean Acoustics (AIP Press, NY, 1994). Each set of solutions is generally valid and computationally efficient in a limited frequency and range regime, and may involve other limits as well. Ray theory is more appropriate at short range and high frequency, while the other solutions function better at long range and low frequency.C. H. Harrison, Ocean propagation models, Applied Acoustics 27, 163‚Äì201 (1989). Various empirical and analytical formulae have also been derived from measurements that are useful approximations.L. M. Brekhovskikh & Yu. P. Lysanov, Fundamentals of Ocean Acoustics, 3rd edition (Springer-Verlag, NY, 2003). Reverberation Transient sounds result in a decaying background that can be of much larger duration than the original transient signal. The cause of this background, known as reverberation, is partly due to scattering from rough boundaries and partly due to scattering from fish and other biota. For an acoustic signal to be detected easily, it must exceed the reverberation level as well as the background noise level. Doppler shift If an underwater object is moving relative to an underwater receiver, the frequency of the received sound is different from that of the sound radiated (or reflected) by the object. This change in frequency is known as a Doppler shift. The shift can be easily observed in active sonar systems, particularly narrow-band ones, because the transmitter frequency is known, and the relative motion between sonar and object can be calculated. Sometimes the frequency of the radiated noise (a tonal) may also be known, in which case the same calculation can be done for passive sonar. For active systems the change in frequency is 0.69 Hz per knot per kHz and half this for passive systems as propagation is only one way. The shift corresponds to an increase in frequency for an approaching target. Intensity fluctuations Though acoustic propagation modelling generally predicts a constant received sound level, in practice there are both temporal and spatial fluctuations. These may be due to both small and large scale environmental phenomena. These can include sound speed profile fine structure and frontal zones as well as internal waves. Because in general there are multiple propagation paths between a source and receiver, small phase changes in the interference pattern between these paths can lead to large fluctuations in sound intensity. Non-linearity In water, especially with air bubbles, the change in density due to a change in pressure is not exactly linearly proportional. As a consequence for a sinusoidal wave input additional harmonic and subharmonic frequencies are generated. When two sinusoidal waves are input, sum and difference frequencies are generated. The conversion process is greater at high source levels than small ones. Because of the non-linearity there is a dependence of sound speed on the pressure amplitude so that large changes travel faster than small ones. Thus a sinusoidal waveform gradually becomes a sawtooth one with a steep rise and a gradual tail. Use is made of this phenomenon in parametric sonar and theories have been developed to account for this, e.g. by Westerfield. Measurements Sound in water is measured using a hydrophone, which is the underwater equivalent of a microphone. A hydrophone measures pressure fluctuations, and these are usually converted to sound pressure level (SPL), which is a logarithmic measure of the mean square acoustic pressure. Measurements are usually reported in one of three forms :- * RMS acoustic pressure in micropascals (or dB re 1 ŒºPa) * RMS acoustic pressure in a specified bandwidth, usually octaves or thirds of octave (dB re 1 ŒºPa) * spectral density (mean square pressure per unit bandwidth) in micropascals- squared per Hertz (dB re 1 ŒºPa¬≤/Hz) The scale for acoustic pressure in water differs from that used for sound in air. In air the reference pressure is 20 ŒºPa rather than 1 ŒºPa. For the same numerical value of SPL, the intensity of a plane wave (power per unit area, proportional to mean square sound pressure divided by acoustic impedance) in air is about 202√ó3600 = 1 440 000 times higher than in water. Similarly, the intensity is about the same if the SPL is 61.6 dB higher in the water. =Sound speed= Approximate values for fresh water and seawater, respectively, at atmospheric pressure are 1450 and 1500 m/s for the sound speed, and 1000 and 1030 kg/m¬≥ for the density.A. D. Pierce, Acoustics: An Introduction to its Physical Principles and Applications (American Institute of Physics, New York, 1989). The speed of sound in water increases with increasing pressure, temperature and salinity.Mackenzie, Nine- term equation for sound speed in the oceans, J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 70, 807‚Äì812 (1982).C. C. Leroy, The speed of sound in pure and neptunian water, in Handbook of Elastic Properties of Solids, Liquids and Gases, edited by Levy, Bass & Stern, Volume IV: Elastic Properties of Fluids: Liquids and Gases (Academic Press, 2001) The maximum speed in pure water under atmospheric pressure is attained at about 74 ¬∞C; sound travels slower in hotter water after that point; the maximum increases with pressure. On-line calculators can be found at Technical Guides ‚Äì Speed of Sound in Sea-Water and Technical Guides ‚Äì Speed of Sound in Pure Water. =Absorption= Many measurements have been made of sound absorption in lakes and the ocean (see Technical Guides ‚Äì Calculation of absorption of sound in seawater for an on-line calculator). =Ambient noise= Measurement of acoustic signals are possible if their amplitude exceeds a minimum threshold, determined partly by the signal processing used and partly by the level of background noise. Ambient noise is that part of the received noise that is independent of the source, receiver and platform characteristics. Thus it excludes reverberation and towing noise for example. The background noise present in the ocean, or ambient noise, has many different sources and varies with location and frequency.G. M. Wenz, Acoustic ambient noise in the ocean: spectra and sources, J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 34, 1936‚Äì1956 (1962). At the lowest frequencies, from about 0.1 Hz to 10 Hz, ocean turbulence and microseisms are the primary contributors to the noise background.S. C. Webb, The equilibrium oceanic microseism spectrum, J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 92, 2141‚Äì2158 (1992). Typical noise spectrum levels decrease with increasing frequency from about 140 dB re 1 ŒºPa¬≤/Hz at 1 Hz to about 30 dB re 1 ŒºPa¬≤/Hz at 100 kHz. Distant ship traffic is one of the dominant noise sources in most areas for frequencies of around 100 Hz, while wind-induced surface noise is the main source between 1 kHz and 30 kHz. At very high frequencies, above 100 kHz, thermal noise of water molecules begins to dominate. The thermal noise spectral level at 100 kHz is 25 dB re 1 ŒºPa¬≤/Hz. The spectral density of thermal noise increases by 20 dB per decade (approximately 6 dB per octave).R. H. Mellen, The Thermal-Noise Limit in the Detection of Underwater Acoustic Signals, J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 24, 478‚Äì480 (1952). Transient sound sources also contribute to ambient noise. These can include intermittent geological activity, such as earthquakes and underwater volcanoes,R. S. Dietz and M. J. Sheehy, Transpacific detection of myojin volcanic explosions by underwater sound. Bulletin of the Geological Society 2 942‚Äì956 (1954). rainfall on the surface, and biological activity. Biological sources include cetaceans (especially blue, fin and sperm whales),M. A. McDonald, J. A. Hildebrand & S. M. Wiggins, Increases in deep ocean ambient noise in the Northeast Pacific west of San Nicolas Island, California, J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 120, 711‚Äì718 (2006).Ocean Noise and Marine Mammals, National Research Council of the National Academies (The National Academies Press, Washington DC, 2003). certain types of fish, and snapping shrimp. Rain can produce high levels of ambient noise. However the numerical relationship between rain rate and ambient noise level is difficult to determine because measurement of rain rate is problematic at sea. =Reverberation= Many measurements have been made of sea surface, bottom and volume reverberation. Empirical models have sometimes been derived from these. A commonly used expression for the band 0.4 to 6.4 kHz is that by Chapman and Harris.R Chapman and J Harris, Surface backscattering Strengths Measured with Explosive Sound Sources. J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 34, 547 (1962) It is found that a sinusoidal waveform is spread in frequency due to the surface motion. For bottom reverberation a Lambert's Law is found often to apply approximately, for example see Mackenzie.K Mackenzie, Bottom Reverberation for 530 and 1030 cps Sound in Deep Water. J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 36, 1596 (1964) Volume reverberation is usually found to occur mainly in layers, which change depth with the time of day, e.g., see Marshall and Chapman.J. R. Marshall and R. P. Chapman, Reverberation from a Deep Scattering Layer Measured with Explosive Sound Sources. J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 36, 164 (1964) The under-surface of ice can produce strong reverberation when it is rough, see for example Milne.A. Milne, Underwater Backscattering Strengths of Arctic Pack Ice. J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 36, 1551 (1964) =Bottom loss= Bottom loss has been measured as a function of grazing angle for many frequencies in various locations, for example those by the US Marine Geophysical Survey.MGS Station Data Listing and Report Catalog, Nav Oceanog Office Special Publication 142, 1974 The loss depends on the sound speed in the bottom (which is affected by gradients and layering) and by roughness. Graphs have been produced for the loss to be expected in particular circumstances. In shallow water bottom loss often has the dominant impact on long range propagation. At low frequencies sound can propagate through the sediment then back into the water. Underwater hearing =Comparison with airborne sound levels= As with airborne sound, sound pressure level underwater is usually reported in units of decibels, but there are some important differences that make it difficult (and often inappropriate) to compare SPL in water with SPL in air. These differences include:D.M.F. Chapman, D.D. Ellis, The elusive decibel ‚Äì thoughts on sonars and marine mammals, Can. Acoust. 26(2), 29‚Äì31 (1996) * difference in reference pressure: 1 ŒºPa (one micropascal, or one millionth of a pascal) instead of 20 ŒºPa.C. L. Morfey, Dictionary of Acoustics (Academic Press, San Diego, 2001). * difference in interpretation: there are two schools of thought, one maintaining that pressures should be compared directly, and the other that one should first convert to the intensity of an equivalent plane wave. * difference in hearing sensitivity: any comparison with (A-weighted) sound in air needs to take into account the differences in hearing sensitivity, either of a human diver or other animal.W. J. Richardson, C. R. Greene, C. I. Malme and D. H. Thomson, Marine Mammals and Noise (Academic Press, San Diego, 1995). =Human hearing= Hearing sensitivity The lowest audible SPL for a human diver with normal hearing is about 67 dB re 1 ŒºPa, with greatest sensitivity occurring at frequencies around 1 kHz.S. J. Parvin, E. A. Cudahy & D. M. Fothergill, Guidance for diver exposure to underwater sound in the frequency range 500 to 2500 Hz, Underwater Defence Technology (2002). This corresponds to a sound intensity 5.4 dB, or 3.5 times, higher than the threshold in air (see Measurements above). Safety thresholds High levels of underwater sound create a potential hazard to human divers. Guidelines for exposure of human divers to underwater sound are reported by the SOLMAR project of the NATO Undersea Research Centre.NATO Undersea Research Centre Human Diver and Marine Mammal Risk Mitigation Rules and Procedures, NURC Special Publication NURC-SP-2006-008, September 2006 Human divers exposed to SPL above 154 dB re 1 ŒºPa in the frequency range 0.6 to 2.5 kHz are reported to experience changes in their heart rate or breathing frequency. Diver aversion to low frequency sound is dependent upon sound pressure level and center frequency. =Other species= Aquatic mammals Dolphins and other toothed whales are known for their acute hearing sensitivity, especially in the frequency range 5 to 50 kHz.W. W. L. Au, The Sonar of Dolphins (Springer, NY, 1993). Several species have hearing thresholds between 30 and 50 dB re 1 ŒºPa in this frequency range. For example, the hearing threshold of the killer whale occurs at an RMS acoustic pressure of 0.02 mPa (and frequency 15 kHz), corresponding to an SPL threshold of 26 dB re 1 ŒºPa.D. Simmonds & J. MacLennan, Fisheries Acoustics: Theory and Practice, 2nd edition (Blackwell, Oxford, 2005) High levels of underwater sound create a potential hazard to marine and amphibious animals. The effects of exposure to underwater noise are reviewed by Southall et al.Southall, B. L., Bowles, A. E., Ellison, W. T., Finneran, J. J., Gentry, R. L., Greene, C. R., ... & Richardson, W. J.

Auditory evoked potential audiometry in fish. Reviews in fish biology and fisheries, 23(3), 317-364. The hearing threshold of the soldier fish, is 0.32 mPa (50 dB re 1 ŒºPa) at 1.3 kHz, whereas the lobster has a hearing threshold of 1.3 Pa at 70 Hz (122 dB re 1 ŒºPa). The effects of exposure to underwater noise are reviewed by Popper et al.Popper, A. N., Hawkins, A. D., Fay, R. R., Mann, D. A., Bartol, S., Carlson, T. J., ... & L√∏kkeborg, S. (2014).

Applications of underwater acoustics =Sonar= Sonar is the name given to the acoustic equivalent of radar. Pulses of sound are used to probe the sea, and the echoes are then processed to extract information about the sea, its boundaries and submerged objects. An alternative use, known as passive sonar, attempts to do the same by listening to the sounds radiated by underwater objects. =Underwater communication= The need for underwater acoustic telemetry exists in applications such as data harvesting for environmental monitoring, communication with and between manned and unmanned underwater vehicles, transmission of diver speech, etc. A related application is underwater remote control, in which acoustic telemetry is used to remotely actuate a switch or trigger an event. A prominent example of underwater remote control are acoustic releases, devices that are used to return sea floor deployed instrument packages or other payloads to the surface per remote command at the end of a deployment. Acoustic communications form an active field of research D. B. Kilfoyle and A. B. Baggeroer, \\"The state of the art in underwater acoustic telemetry,\\" IEEE J. Oceanic Eng. 25, 4‚Äì27 (2000).M.Stojanovic, \\"Acoustic (Underwater) Communications,\\" entry in Encyclopedia of Telecommunications, John G. Proakis, Ed., John Wiley & Sons, 2003. with significant challenges to overcome, especially in horizontal, shallow-water channels. Compared with radio telecommunications, the available bandwidth is reduced by several orders of magnitude. Moreover, the low speed of sound causes multipath propagation to stretch over time delay intervals of tens or hundreds of milliseconds, as well as significant Doppler shifts and spreading. Often acoustic communication systems are not limited by noise, but by reverberation and time variability beyond the capability of receiver algorithms. The fidelity of underwater communication links can be greatly improved by the use of hydrophone arrays, which allow processing techniques such as adaptive beamforming and diversity combining. =Underwater navigation and tracking= Underwater navigation and tracking is a common requirement for exploration and work by divers, ROV, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV), manned submersibles and submarines alike. Unlike most radio signals which are quickly absorbed, sound propagates far underwater and at a rate that can be precisely measured or estimated.Underwater Acoustic Positioning Systems, P.H. Milne 1983, It can thus be used to measure distances between a tracked target and one or multiple reference of baseline stations precisely, and triangulate the position of the target, sometimes with centimeter accuracy. Starting in the 1960s, this has given rise to underwater acoustic positioning systems which are now widely used. =Seismic exploration= Seismic exploration involves the use of low frequency sound (< 100 Hz) to probe deep into the seabed. Despite the relatively poor resolution due to their long wavelength, low frequency sounds are preferred because high frequencies are heavily attenuated when they travel through the seabed. Sound sources used include airguns, vibroseis and explosives. =Weather and climate observation= Acoustic sensors can be used to monitor the sound made by wind and precipitation. For example, an acoustic rain gauge is described by Nystuen.J. A. Nystuen, Listening to raindrops from underwater: An acoustic disdrometer, J Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology, 18(10), 1640‚Äì1657 (2001). Lightning strikes can also be detected.R. D. Hill, Investigation of lightning strikes to water surfaces, J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 78, 2096‚Äì2099 (1985). Acoustic thermometry of ocean climate (ATOC) uses low frequency sound to measure the global ocean temperature. =Oceanography= Large scale ocean features can be detected by acoustic tomography. Bottom characteristics can be measured by side-scan sonar and sub-bottom profiling. =Marine biology= Due to its excellent propagation properties, underwater sound is used as a tool to aid the study of marine life, from microplankton to the blue whale. Echo sounders are often used to provide data on marine life abundance, distribution, and behavior information. Echo sounders, also referred to as hydroacoustics is also used for fish location, quantity, size, and biomass. Acoustic telemetry is also used for monitoring fish and marine wildlife. An acoustic transmitter is attached to the fish (sometimes internally) while an array of receivers listen to the information conveyed by the sound wave. This enables the researchers to track the movements of individuals in a small-medium scale.Moore, A., T. Storeton-West, I. C. Russell, E. C. E. Potter, and M. J. Challiss. 1990.

For this reason, it requires detection apparatus on a very large scale, and the ocean is sometimes used for this purpose. In particular, it is thought that ultra-high energy neutrinos in seawater can be detected acoustically.S. Bevan, S. Danaher, J. Perkin, S. Ralph, C. Rhodes, L. Thompson, T. Sloane, D.

Gusukuma also trained under Higaonna Kanry≈ç in the Naha-te style. Gusukuma went on to establish Shit≈ç-ry≈´ with Kenwa Mabuni. Early years Gusukuma Shinpan born in 1890 in the town of Taira in Shuri, Okinawa. At the age of thirteen, he began the study of karate with Anko Itosu, and in 1908 he began training with Kanryo Higaonna, along with Kenwa Mabuni. In 1909 at the age of eighteen, Shipan was inducted into the Japanese Navy. He became a school teacher by profession and worked as a professor in the Shuri Dai Ichi Elementary School where he also taught karate. He was also known for his skills as an acupuncturist and taught the art.Shito-ryu Shinpan began teaching Shorin-ryu shortly after World War II and was associated with Miyagi Chojun, Kyoda Jyuhatsu and Kyan Chotoku. He taught regularly at Shuri Castle and had a dojo at his home in Nishihara City. On Okinawa, there were two branches of Shito- Ryu, one founded by Shinpan Shiroma and the other by Kenwa Mabuni. Because he continued to maintain schools only in Okinawa, Shinpan created the only known Okinawan branch of Shit≈ç-ry≈´. He established an organization called the Shinpan Shiroma Shito-ryu Preservation Society to assist with his teaching and served as president.Shito-ryu 3 Karate Foundational Principles thumb Gusukuma outlined the three foundational principles of karate as kata, jutsu, and ryaku. Without all three, the martial application is lost. Kata is the foundational form by which the body develops proper posture, breathing, balance, flexibility, and unified muscle/tendon/hip control for maximum outpower. Jutsu encompasses the bunkai or analysis of the martial techniques; only some of which are derived from kata. Over time, these techniques become muscle memory. Almost all kata movements have multiple bunkai, but bunkai is not limited to kata analysis nor the bunkai of the curriculum. Ryaku is the ‚Äúabbreviation‚Äù, used in this context to describe the actual application of technique. It is represented in the spontaneous free-flowing of movements as counters to attacks. Oyo bunkai in the curriculum is a baby step toward ryaku; moving from block printing to cursive, yet still within the ‚Äúwording‚Äù of kata. Ryaku is free composition based upon the ‚Äútheme‚Äù of kata. Sensei Seikichi Iha, 10th Dan, Shidokan Karate, a student of Gusukuma's, reminds us that it is the responsibility of the dedicated student to seek out partners for the exploration of jutsu and ryaku. There we find the joy of exploration. Final years Shinpan suffered during the Battle of Okinawa and lost many of his students, but after World War II, he reopened his dojo in Shuri. Shinpan died in 1954 at the age of 64. He taught class and trained for two hours on the day of his death, ate a light dinner and went to bed early. Three hours later his wife found that he had died in his sleep. His student Horoku Ishikawa continued his branch of Shito-ryu.

Doughney, 263 F.3d 359 (4th Cir. 2001), was an important Internet domain trademark infringement decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. Michael Doughney registered the domain name peta.org in 1995 and created a website called \\"People Eating Tasty Animals\\". The site described itself as \\"a resource for those who enjoy eating meat, wearing fur and leather, hunting, and the fruits of scientific research\\".Sonja Barisic, Court orders owner of PETA parody site to relinquish address , Associated Press (June 20, 2000). People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) sued Doughney, alleging trademark infringement, trademark dilution, and cybersquatting. The case was initially heard in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, and both parties cross-appealed. The circuit court affirmed the district's court ruling, which had granted summary judgment to PETA. However, the court denied PETA's cross-appeal for attorney's fees and costs, because it held that Doughney's action was not malicious.People for Ethical Treatment of Animals v. Doughney, 263 F.3d 359(4th Cir. 2001). McCullagh, Declan (August 25, 2001). \\"Ethical Treatment of PETA Domain\\" . Wired. Background In 1995, Doughney registered the domain name peta.org for his website titled \\"People Eating Tasty Animals\\". The website contained links to over 30 sites including some that promoted the sale of leather goods and meats. At the bottom of the page, the website inquired \\"Feeling lost? Offended? Perhaps you should, like, exit immediately\\" and provided a link to the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals website. In 1996, PETA requested that Doughney voluntarily transfer the domain name, because it owned the trademark \\"PETA\\". Doughney refused to do so, leading to the lawsuit. PETA asserted claims of service mark infringement, unfair competition, trademark dilution, and cybersquatting. Initially, PETA did not seek compensation other than enjoining Doughney from using the peta.org domain and an order to transfer peta.org to PETA. The district court ruled in favor of PETA in its summary judgment, leading to the appeal of the case to the circuit court. Accusation of trademark infringement/unfair competition PETA was a registered trademark that belonged to People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. Thus the trademark infringement claim centered on whether \\"defendant used the mark 'in connection with the sale, offering for sale, distribution, or advertising' of goods or services\\" The court concluded that because the website prevented others from accessing the actual PETA website, it was a use in \\"commerce\\". Doughney claimed that his peta.org website was a parody of the PETA organization, and was free speech permissible under the First Amendment. The court relied on Cliffs Notes, Inc. v. Bantam Doubleday Dell Publ'g Group, Inc., to rule that, in order to constitute a parody, the peta.org domain must simultaneously convey that (1) the site was the PETA site; and (2) the contradictory message that it is merely a parody. The court held that the domain name \\"peta.org\\" itself only conveyed the first meaning, and thus did not qualify as a parody. The court was unwilling to consider the domain name in conjunction with the site's content for the purposes of determining whether the site \\"simultaneously\\" conveyed these two meanings, writing, \\"Looking at Doughney's domain name alone, there is no suggestion of a parody...The domain name does not convey the second, contradictory message needed to establish a parody -a message that the domain name is not related to PETA, but that it is a parody of PETA. Doughney claims that this second message can be found in the content of his website. Indeed, the website's content makes it clear that it is not related to PETA. However, this second message is not conveyed simultaneously with the first message, as required to be considered a parody. The domain name conveys the first message; the second message is conveyed only when the viewer reads the content of the website\\". This refusal to consider a site's content when determining whether it qualifies as a parody was arguably rejected by the Fourth Circuit a few years later in Lamparello v. Falwell, 420 F.3d 309 (4th Cir. 2005), where in discussing PETA v. Doughney, the court wrote, \\"[t]o determine whether a likelihood of confusion exists, a court should not consider how closely a fragment of a given use duplicates the trademark, but must instead consider whether the use in its entirety creates a likelihood of confusion\\". When dealing with domain names, this means a court must evaluate an allegedly infringing domain name in conjunction with the content of the website identified by the domain name\\".Lamparello v. Falwell, 420 F.3d 309 (4th Cir. 2005). Accusation of cybersquatting Although PETA did not initially allege that Doughney violated the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act (ACPA), it raised it during its request for summary judgement. Before and during the litigation, Doughney made statements suggesting that PETA should \\"settle\\" with him and \\"make him an offer\\".U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals, PETA v. Doughney https://cyber.harvard.edu/stjohns/PETA_v_Doughney.html This was seen by the court as his attempt to profit from the peta.org domain. Because of this and the fact that the domain name is identical to the distinctive PETA trademark, the court ruled that Doughney violated the ACPA. However, the court further held that PETA was not entitled to damages because Doughney registered and used the domain prior to ACPA's enactment. Instead Doughney was merely required to surrender the domain. Ineligible for compensation The court ruled that PETA was ineligible for an award of attorney's fees because Doughney did not maliciously infringe the trademark because he was creating a parody and had a First Amendment right to do so.

The bridge and adjacent Sorell Causeway provide vital links between Hobart and two of Tasmania's principal tourist attractions - Port Arthur Historic Site on the Tasman Peninsula and the picturesque East Coast via the Tasman Highway. McGee's Bridge is also a popular fishing destination for locals and tourists. History The Tasmanian Government decided in the mid 19th century that if a crossing at Pitt Water could be made, it would considerably reduce the time to reach Sorell. It was decided to build a causeway for two-thirds of the length of Pitt Water and use a bridge to complete the rest of the crossing. A single- lane timber bridge was the first construction, but continuing maintenance on a major highway bridge became a significant problem. As a result, Australia's first post-tensioned beam and slab bridge was completed in 1957. A feature of the bridge was that the voids for the tendons were created using inflated rubber tubes which were withdrawn after the concrete had set. The bridge was given a 50-year life span. In 2001 it became apparent that the ingress of chlorides had caused the bridge to deteriorate seriously. The State Government awarded John Holland P/L a design/build contract to replace the ageing bridge. The new bridge (designed by GHD) is thought to be the first match-cast precast-segmental channel-type road bridge outside France and the United States. The $20 million McGee's Bridge was the largest single infrastructure project funded by the State Government for more than 15 years. The new bridge was named as a tribute to Dr Rodney William McGee, ESM, who died after a long battle with cancer on February 1, 2002, aged 47. At the time of his death he was a senior engineer with the Department of Infrastructure, Energy and Resources and was recognised interstate and internationally for his expertise in bridge engineering. The project was marked by extensive community involvement and particular attention to safeguarding the local environment, as the bridge is in an internationally recognised wetlands site and designated heritage area. The Premier of Tasmania, Jim Bacon was present at the official opening ceremony which was also attended by the Minister for Infrastructure, Jim Cox, the Mayor of Sorell, Carmel Torenius, and members of Rod McGee's family.

Born in Claudy, Gormley was educated at St Columb's College and then St. Patrick's College, Maynooth (NUI). In 1945, he was elected to the Derry County Council, representing the Nationalist Party. His brother Tom, soon followed him into politics. At the 1953 election to the Parliament of Northern Ireland, Gormley was elected to represent Mid Londonderry. In the three subsequent elections, he was elected unopposed. However, his increasing distance from the majority of the Nationalist Party lost him the chance to become Chairman of the Parliamentary Party in 1964, Eddie McAteer instead taking charge. Just before the 1965 election, Gormley was seriously injured in a car accident in Carrickmacross. Although he was elected, he remained in hospital until January the following year and eventually won an action against the driver of a lorry involved in the crash. Despite his injuries, Gormley stood for Londonderry at the 1966 UK general election. He took second place, with 37% of the votes cast. In May 1966, he became Deputy Chairman of Ways and Means and Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons, standing down in February 1967. In 1966, Gormley spoke warmly of Prime Minister of Northern Ireland Terence O'Neill's overtures to nationalists. He began questioning the party line on issues such as interdenominational schooling, and called for the Nationalist Party to become a centre left radical party. His criticism of more radical nationalists at the start of The Troubles and his limited support for some of Stormont's actions lost him his seat at the 1969 election.

From the late Sengoku era to the start of the Meiji era, the Tanegashima were retainers of the Shimazu clan of the Satsuma Domain.  Origin  The Tanegashima clan claims Taira ancestry. According to the family genealogy, its founder Nobumoto (‰ø°Âü∫) was a great-grandson of Taira no Kiyomori. Surviving the Genpei War (1180‚Äì1185), he was adopted by H≈çj≈ç Tokimasa, changed his name to Tokinobu (ÊôÇ‰ø°) and was given the island of Tanegashima at the beginning of the Kamakura period. However, this story is considered unhistorical because no contemporary source supports it. The actual origin of the Tanegashima clan was the Higo clan. In 1203, H≈çj≈ç Tomotoki, the founder of the Nagoe branch of the H≈çj≈ç clan, was appointed as a jit≈ç or land steward of the estate of Shimazu, which covered Tanegashima Island. Since the Nagoe family resided in Kamakura, the Higo clan was sent to the estate to rule it on behalf of the Nagoe family. Some members of the Higo clan seem to have spread to Tanegashima. The Higo clan made itself autonomous in Tanegashima after the H≈çj≈ç clan was annihilated. During the Nanboku-ch≈ç period, it began to claim the clan name of Tanegashima, which implied the ownership of the island.  Semi-autonomy  During the Nanboku-ch≈ç period, the Tanegashima clan began to contact with the Shimazu clan, who had gained the position of the shugo or governor of Satsuma, ≈åsumi and Hy≈´ga Provinces. Shimazu long suffered from internal struggles and faced resistance from local rulers. The Tanegashima clan enjoyed a high degree of autonomy until Shimazu unified southern Ky≈´sh≈´ in the late 16th century. Tanegashima (right), Yakushima (center), Kuchierabu (center left) and the Upper Three Islands (upper left). Shimazu ceded control of various southern islands to Tanegashima. In 1409, Higo (Tanegashima) Kiyotoki was given the islands of Yaku and Kuchierabu by Shimazu Motohisa, the head of the ≈åsh≈´ branch of the Shimazu clan, who rivaled the S≈çsh≈´ branch family. In 1424, however, Tanegashima was forced to give Kuchierabu back to the ≈åsh≈´ family although it regained the island three years later. In the 1420s, the ≈åsh≈´ family gave the Upper Three Islands (Kuroshima, I≈çjima and Takeshima) to the Tanegashima clan. Around 1430, however, they were recaptured by Shimazu. In 1436, Shimazu Mochihisa, the head of Sassh≈´, another branch family, gave Kiyotoki's son Hatatoki two of the Seven Islands, which are identified as Gaja and Taira Islands. The Tanegashima clan established firm control over Yakushima, which was known for forestry. In 1524 Tanegashima Tadatoki built two fortresses on Yakushima. In 1543, Tadatoki's son Shigetoki was attacked by Nejime Shigetake, a ruler of ≈åsumi Province, and fled to Tanegashima. Shigetoki handed over Yakushima to Nejime but restored it by force the following near. Tanegashima continued to battle against Nejime until 1572.  Trade  Tanegashima Tokiuji, Tadatoki's father, established a channel of communication to Kinai (central Japan). In the 1460s the population of Tanegashima, Yakushima and Kuchierabu converted en masse to the Hokke sect of Nichiren Buddhism. This established a firm link to Honn≈ç-ji of Kyoto and Honk≈çji of Settsu Province, the sect's strongholds. Historical sources show that gifts dedicated to Honn≈ç-ji by Tanegashima Tokiuji included Chinese and South Asian products such as silk fabric and pepper. In addition to Buddhist monks, craftsmen were moved from Kinai to Tanegashima. The heads of the Tanegashima clan personally visited Kinai and developed a network of contacts. Using this network, Tanegashima Shigetoki served as an intermediary between the imperial court and the S≈çsh≈´ branch of the Shimazu clan, who later re- unified the Shimazu clan. Tanegashima Island functioned as a relay station of one of the main routes of Chinese trade that connected Sakai to Ningbo. The Tanegashima clan cooperated with the Hosokawa clan, one of two powers who controlled Chinese trade. Tanegashima also engaged in trade with Okinawa- centered kingdom of Ry≈´ky≈´, which is attested by some letters given to Tanegashima by Ry≈´ky≈´ in the 16th century. It is known that Japanese trade ships to Ming China exported Southeast Asian products such as pepper and sappanwood. They were probably obtained by the Tanegashima clan via Ry≈´ky≈´. Historians draw attention to a letter given to Ry≈´ky≈´ by the ≈åuchi clan in 1542, which requested Ry≈´ky≈´ to detain Tanegashima's ships. The ≈åuchi clan, who rivaled the Hosokawa clan in Chinese trade, seems to have intended to bar Hosokawa from trade. Tanegashima is traditionally known as the site of the introduction of European firearms to Japan although this account is frequently questioned by historians. It is said that firearms were introduced in 1543 by the Portuguese who drifted to Tanegashima. The Tanegashima clan, led by its 15 year old daimy≈ç Tanegashima Tokitaka, quickly acquired the methods of producing firearms and gunpowder. Due to Tanegashima's role in the spread of firearms, firearms were colloquially known as \\"Tanegashima\\" in Japan.  Vassalage to Shimazu  Although Tanegashima had long enjoyed semi-autonomy, the newly unified Shimazu clan gradually tightened control over the clan. In 1582, Tanegashima's trade with Ry≈´ky≈´ was put under control of Shimazu. Shimazu also forbade Tanegashima from selling lumber to the rulers of Ky≈´sh≈´ except Shimazu. After subjugating Shimazu, Toyotomi Hideyoshi finalized Tanegashima's vassalage to Shimazu. In 1595, the Tanegashima clan was moved from its medieval homeland to Chiran, Satsuma Province. Although Tanegashima was given back to the Tanegashima clan in 1599, the islands of Yaku and Kuchierabu remained under Shimazu's direct rule. In 1598, Tanegashima Hisatoki was appointed as kar≈ç or top-ranking official. This family rank was maintained throughout the Edo period. When Hisatoki died in 1612 leaving his successor in the mother's womb, Shimazu intervened in Tanegashima's governance, making it a dutiful subject. The 24th head Hisamichi (‰πÖÈÅì) died in 1829 without male issue. His widow Sh≈çjuin, who was a daughter of Shimazu Narinobu and a sister of Shimazu Narioki, administered Tanegashima for 15 years. In 1842 Tanegashima finally adopted Hisamichi (‰πÖÁèç) from the Shimazu clan. The 27th head Moritoki was made a baron in 1900. As of 2012, Tanegashima Tokikuni served as the 29th head of the clan.

It is notable as one of the few surviving accounts of the Great Purge actually written during the purge era. Synopsis Sofia Petrovna, a typist in the Soviet Union in 1937 is proud of the achievements of her son Nikolai (Kolya). Kolya, an engineering student and strong Communist, is at the beginning of a promising career, with his picture featured on the cover of Pravda. Before long, however, the Great Purge begins and Sofia's coworkers begin vanishing, amid accusations of treachery. Soon, Kolya's best friend Alik reports that Kolya has been arrested. Sofia and her friend and fellow typist Natasha try to find out more but are drowned in a sea of bureaucrats and long lines. More people vanish, and Sofia spends ever more time in lines at government buildings. Natasha makes a typographical error that is mistaken for a criticism of the Red Army and she is fired. When Sofia defends her, she is criticized and soon forced out as well. Alik is questioned, and when he does not renounce Kolya, he, too, is arrested and vanishes. Natasha and Sofia both lose their will to live. Natasha commits suicide via poison, and Sofia immerses herself in a fantasy of Kolya's return. When she finally gets a letter from Kolya, in which he reaffirms his innocence and tells more of his own story, Sofia tries to fight for his freedom again, but realizes that, in this bizarre, chaotic place, she will likely only place more suspicion on herself and Kolya. Out of desperation, she burns the letter. History Based on her experiences during the Great Purge of 1938-39, it was written in 1939-40 but remained unpublished due to the critical and honest nature of the piece. Originally written in a school exercise book, it was hidden, as its discovery could have endangered Chukovskaya. With the death of Joseph Stalin in 1953, and his subsequent denunciation by Nikita Khrushchev, Chukovskaya reexamined the work, edited out a no-longer-relevant introduction, and sought publication in 1962. The book was nearly published in 1963, but was pulled before it could be released due to a changing political climate. It finally saw release in France in 1965 in Russian but with a changed title (\\"The Deserted House\\") and different character names. It was then published in the United States, in Russian, with the correct title, in Novy Zhurnal.Chukovskaya, Lydia. Sofia Petrovna. Evanston, IL: Northwestern University Press, 1988. Information found in the Author's Note/foreword, and afterword. However, the book was not published in Chukovskaya's native country, and she forbade publication of any other work until after the release in Russia of Sofia Petrovna.

It has been shown that children as young as two can make some ordinal numerical decisions. There are studies indicating that some non-human primates, like chimpanzees and rhesus monkeys have some ordinal numerical competence. In humans  = Prenatal = There is no evidence to support prenatal ordinal numerical competence. Teratogens such as stress can alter prenatal neural development, leading to diminished competence after birth. Physical effects of teratogens are common, but endocrine effects are harder to measure. These are the factors that influence neural development and by extension the development of ordinal numerical competence. Premature birth is also a risk factor for developmental problems including reduced brain activity. Brain activity is measured from outside the body with electroencephalography. = Infants = There have been a vast number of studies done on infants and their knowledge of numbers. Most research confirms that infants do in fact have a profound innate sense of number, both in abstract and finite ways. Infants as young as 49 hours can accurately match up images with a certain number of objects, with sounds that contain the same number (\\"ra, ra, ra, ra\\") as the number of objects in the image. Because the sounds are abstract, or visibly there, we can see that infants as young as 49 hours have some abstract numerical sense as well as concrete numerical sense shown by their recognition of the image with the corresponding number of objects. Similarly, infants around the age of 7 months can also match up images of random objects. Although children as young as 49 hours can match up the number of sounds with the number of objects, they can only do so at certain ratios. When 1:3 ratios were used (4 sounds and 4 objects or 12 objects), around 90% of the infants paid more attention to the corresponding image thus showing their recognition. However, when 1:2 ratios were used, only 68% of infants showed recognition of the correct corresponding image. This tells us that although infants can recognize corresponding numbers of sounds and objects, the two images of objects must be visibly different - one must have a much larger number of objects, or a much smaller number of objects. Although there has to be a stark difference in the choices for infants to recognize the correct matching set of numbers (1:3 vs 1:2), this seems to prove that infants have an innate numerical sense, but it may not be the same numerical sense as older children. Around the age of three and a half years children lose some of their numerical sense. Whereas children younger than three can recognize that four pebbles spread out in a line is less than six pebbles scrunched together in a line, children around the age of three and a half mysteriously lose this ability. Researchers believe that this is because children around this age begin to rely heavily on the physical properties of the world and objects within it, such that longer equals more. Although the ability to recognize that six pebbles closely lined up together is more than four pebbles spread out farther from one another goes away around that age, it comes back around four years of age when children begin to count. = Adults = Both behavioral research and brain-imaging research show distinct differences in the way \\"exact\\" arithmetic and \\"approximate\\" arithmetic are processed. Exact arithmetic is information that is precise and follows specific rules and patterns such as multiplication tables or geometric formulas, and approximate arithmetic is a general comparison between numbers such as the comparisons of greater than or less than. Research shows that exact arithmetic is language-based and processed in the left inferior frontal lobe. Approximate arithmetic is processed much differently in a different part of the brain. Approximate arithmetic is processed in the bilateral areas of the parietal lobes. This part of the brain processes visual information to understand how objects are spatially related to each other, for example, understanding that 10 of something is more than two of something. This difference in brain function can create a difference in how we experience certain types of arithmetic. Approximate arithmetic can be experienced as intuitive and exact arithmetic experienced as recalled knowledge. The conclusions from behavioral research and brain-imaging research are supported by observations of patients with injuries to certain parts of the brain. People with left parietal injuries can lose the ability to understand quantities of things, but keep at least some ability to do exact arithmetic, such as multiplication. People with left-hemisphere brain damage can lose the ability to do exact arithmetic, but keep a sense of quantity, including the ability to compare larger and smaller numbers. This information confirms that distinct parts of the brain are used to know and use approximate and exact arithmetic. Various researchers suggest that the processing of approximate arithmetic could be related to the numerical abilities that have been independently established in various animal species and in preverbal human infants. This may mean that approximate arithmetic is an adaptive train that humans developed through evolution. The combination of this potential evolutionary trait and language-based exact arithmetic may be the reason that humans are able to do advanced mathematics like physics.  In non-humans  Animals share a non-verbal system for representing number as analogue magnitudes.Brannon, 2005; Brannon & Terrace, 1998-2000; Cantlon & Brannon, 2005; Feigenson, Dehaene, & Spelke, 2004; Gelman &Gallistel;, 2004; Nieder, Freedman, & Miller, 2002; Nieder & Miller, 2003 Animals have been known to base their rationality on Weber‚Äôs Law. This historically important psychological law quantifies the perception of change in a given stimulus. The law states that the change in a stimulus that will be just noticeable is a constant ratio of the original stimulus. Weber‚Äôs Law describes discriminability between values based on perceptual continua such as line length, brightness, and weight.http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/638610/Webers-law = Rhesus monkeys = Studies of rhesus monkeys' foraging decisions indicate that animals spontaneously, and without training, exhibit rudimentary numerical abilities. Most animals can determine numbers in the values 1 through 9, but recent experiments have discovered that rhesus monkeys can quantify values from 1 to 30. Monkeys' numerical discrimination capacity is imposed by the ratio of the values compared, rather than absolute set size. This computation process focuses around Weber‚Äôs Law and the expectation violation procedure. This suggests that rhesus monkeys have access to a spontaneous system of representation, which encodes the numerical differences between sets of one, two and three objects, and contrasts three objects from either four or five objects as well. These representations indicate the semantics of an encoded natural language. These encoded natural languages are also seen in experiments with many animals including pigeons and rats. = Rats and pigeons = Experiments have shown that rats are able to be trained to press one lever after hearing two bursts of white noise, then press another lever after four bursts of white noise. The interburst interval is varied between trials so the discrimination is based on number of bursts and not time duration of the sequence. Studies show that rats as well as pigeons learned to make different responses to both short and long durations of signals. During testing, rats exhibited a pattern called break-run-break; when it came to responding after a stint of little to no response, they would suddenly respond in high frequency, then return to little or no response activity. Data suggests that rats and pigeons are able to process time and number information at the same time. The Mode Control Model shows that these animals can process number and time information by transmission pulses to accumulators controlled by switches that operate different modes.

Battery electric vehicles operate solely in this mode. Most plug-in hybrids operate in charge-depleting mode at startup, and switch to charge-sustaining mode after the battery has reached its minimum state of charge (SOC) threshold, exhausting the vehicle's all-electric range (AER). Although there is no technically mandated minimum all-electric range, future state and/or federal legislation may address this for policy purposes. Another charge-depleting strategy is called blended mode, in which the engine supplements the battery during medium to heavy loads. Although this strategy does not include a purely all-electric mode, early NREL (National Renewable Energy Laboratory) simulations indicate that similar fuel savings as compared to conventional plug-in hybrid battery discharge and charge strategies. One advantage of a blended mode is that it may afford the vehicle designer the opportunity to use a smaller and less costly battery pack and traction motor.

The units of SoC are percentage points (0% = empty; 100% = full). An alternative form of the same measure is the depth of discharge (DoD), the inverse of SoC (100% = empty; 0% = full). SoC is normally used when discussing the current state of a battery in use, while DoD is most often seen when discussing the lifetime of the battery after repeated use. In a battery electric vehicle (BEV), hybrid vehicle (HV), or plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV), SoC for the battery pack is the equivalent of a fuel gauge. It is important to mention that state of charge, presented as a gauge or percentual value at any vehicle dashboard, especially in plug-in hybrid vehicles, may not be representative for a real level of charge. In that particular case, some noticeable amount of energy stored in the electric battery is not shown at the dashboard, and it is reserved for hybrid-work operations. It permits a vehicle to accelerate with electric motor(s) mainly using battery energy, while engine serves as a generator is used to recharge the battery to the minimum level needed for such operation. Examples of such cars are Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV (all versions/years of production), where 0% of the state of charge presented to the driver is a real 20-22% of charge level (assuming zero level as the lowest level of charge permitted by car producer). Another one is BMW i3 REX (Range Extender version), where about 6% of SOC is reserved for PHEV-alike operations.  Determining SoC  Usually, SoC cannot be measured directly but it can be estimated from direct measurement variables in two ways: offline and online. In offline techniques, the battery desires to be charged and discharged in constant rate such as Coulomb-counting. This method gives precise estimation of battery SoC, but they are protracted, costly, and interrupt main battery performance. Therefore, researchers are looking for some online techniques. In general there are five methods to determine SoC indirectly: * chemical * voltage * current integration * Kalman filtering * pressure = Chemical method = This method works only with batteries that offer access to their liquid electrolyte, such as non-sealed lead acid batteries. The specific gravity or pH of the electrolyte can be used to indicate the SoC of the battery. Hydrometers are used to calculate the specific gravity of a battery. To find specific gravity, it is necessary to measure out volume of the electrolyte and to weigh it. Then specific gravity is given by (mass of electrolyte [g]/ volume of electrolyte [ml])/ (Density of Water, i.e. 1g/1ml). To find SoC from specific gravity, a look-up table of SG vs SoC is needed. More recently immersion refractometry has been shown to be a viable method for continuous monitoring of the state of charge. The refractive index of the battery electrolyte is directly relatable to the specific gravity or density of the electrolyte of the cell.Sensors, Vol.22 No.1, pg 10 Jan. 2005, US patent 10,145,789 = Voltage method = This method converts a reading of the battery voltage to SoC, using the known discharge curve (voltage vs. SoC) of the battery. However, the voltage is more significantly affected by the battery current (due to the battery's electrochemical kinetics) and temperature. This method can be made more accurate by compensating the voltage reading by a correction term proportional to the battery current, and by using a look-up table of battery's open circuit voltage vs. temperature. In fact, it is a stated goal of battery design to provide a voltage as constant as possible no matter the SoC, which makes this method difficult to apply. = Current integration method = This method, also known as \\"coulomb counting\\", calculates the SoC by measuring the battery current and integrating it in time. Since no measurement can be perfect, this method suffers from long-term drift and lack of a reference point: therefore, the SoC must be re-calibrated on a regular basis, such as by resetting the SoC to 100% when a charger determines that the battery is fully charged (using one of the other methods described here). = Combined approaches = Maxim Integrated touts a combined voltage and charge approach that is claimed superior to either method alone; it is implemented in their ModelGauge m3 series of chips, such as MAX17050,http://www.analog-eetimes.com/en/high-accuracy-battery-fuel-gauge- maximizes-battery-capacity-and-boosts-user- confidence.html?cmp_id=7&news;_id=222904749 which is used in the Nexus 6 and Nexus 9 Android devices, for example. = Kalman filtering = To overcome the shortcomings of the voltage method and the current integration method, a Kalman filter can be used. The battery can be modeled with an electrical model which the Kalman filter will use to predict the over-voltage, due to the current. In combination with coulomb counting, it can make an accurate estimation of the state of charge. The strength of a Kalman filter is that it is able to adjust its trust of the battery voltage and coulomb counting in real time.Zhang, J. and Lee, J., A review on prognostics and health monitoring of Li-ion battery . = Pressure method = This method can be used with certain NiMH batteries, whose internal pressure increases rapidly when the battery is charged. More commonly, a pressure switch indicates if the battery is fully charged. This method may be improved by taking into account Peukert's law which is a function of charge/discharge rate or ampere.

He previously served as the linebackers coach and special teams coordinator for the Michigan State Spartans. He is the former head coach of the Marshall University Thundering Herd football team in Huntington, West Virginia. Snyder was the 28th head coach for the football squad after a four-year tenure as a defensive coordinator with Ohio State University. Playing career The South Point, Ohio, native is a 1988 graduate of Marshall. Snyder played in 1987 for the football squad, leading the Southern Conference with 10 interceptions and was second on the team with 124 tackles his senior year at Marshall and helped lead the Herd to a landmark come from behind win at Louisville and a berth in Marshall's first-ever national championship game. He captured honorable mention All-America honors and first-team All-Southern Conference honors that season as the Thundering Herd posted a 10-5 overall record and finished as national runners-up to Northeast Louisiana (43-42) in the 1987 Division 1-AA National Championship game. Snyder's 10 interceptions in 1987 still stands as the Marshall and Southern Conference single-season record. Coaching career =Early coaching= After graduating from Marshall, the following fall he began his coaching career as a student assistant coach for the Herd. He moved on to the UCF Knights the following year and spent two seasons there, the first as a graduate assistant and the second coaching linebackers. In 1991, Snyder joined Jim Tressel at Youngstown State University as the outside linebacker coach. Snyder was given special teams and inside linebacker responsibilities in 1994, and then promoted to defensive coordinator and secondary coach in 1996. During his tenure at Youngstown State, the Penguins won three NCAA Division 1-AA national championships and played in four consecutive national championship games, facing Marshall in three of those contests (1991, 1992, and 1993). Following the 1996 season, Snyder went on to spend four years as the defensive ends coach under Glen Mason at Minnesota. While coaching the Golden Gophers, Minnesota's defense twice set school records for single-season sacks and averaged 40.7 sacks during a three-year span. While at Minnesota, Snyder's best players were Lamanzer Williams, who led the nation in sacks in 1997, and Karon Riley, the Big Ten Defensive Player of the Year in 2000. =Ohio State Buckeyes= Snyder again reunited with Jim Tressel at Ohio State University and was coming off of his first season as the Buckeyes' defensive coordinator. In Snyder's four years at Ohio State, the Buckeyes posted a 40-11 overall record and tallied a 3-1 record in bowl games, including victories in the 2003 and 2004 Tostitos Fiesta Bowls. Snyder helped develop a number of outstanding players at Ohio State, including All-Americans Matt Wilhelm, Cie Grant, and A. J. Hawk. Both Wilhelm and Grant played key roles in Ohio State's 2002 national championship before going on to become NFL draft picks. Hawk led OSU with 141 tackles en route to becoming the No. 5 overall pick by the Green Bay Packers in the 2006 NFL Draft. =Return to Marshall= Marshall University's football program welcomed home one of its own when Mark Snyder was introduced as Marshall's 28th head football coach on April 14, 2005. \\"I am pleased that Mark decided to return to his alma mater and lead our football program into a new era,\\" Marshall Director of Athletics Bob Marcum said at Snyder's hiring. \\"He brings a great deal of experience, enthusiasm, and a proven record of success at the highest levels of college football to Marshall.\\" Snyder was the head coach at Marshall for five seasons (2005-09) and helped lead the Thundering Herd transition from the Mid-American Conference to Conference USA. In Snyder's final year in 2009, Marshall went 6-6 during the regular-season and earned a berth in the Little Caesars Pizza Bowl. His program produced 40 all-conference selections, including 2006 Conference USA Defensive Player of the Year Albert McClellan, who had 18.5 tackles for loss and 11.5 sacks his sophomore season. Snyder produced a 22-37 overall record at Marshall (17-23 Conference USA). Under Snyder, running back Ahmad Bradshaw was a two-time All-C-USA pick and ran for 19 touchdowns and 1,523 yards as a junior in 2006 to earn first-team all-league honors. Bradshaw was selected in the seventh round of the 2007 NFL Draft (No. 250 overall) by the New York Giants and won two Super Bowls with the Giants (XLII, XLVI); he is one of just eight running backs in NFL history to be the leading rusher in two Super Bowls. McClellan, who had to sit out the 2007 season due to a knee injury, returned in 2008 to earn first-team All-C-USA honors for the second time in his career. He signed with the Baltimore Ravens as a rookie free agent in 2009 and is currently playing his fourth season in the NFL, all in Baltimore. =South Florida= On January 18, 2010, Snyder was named the defensive coordinator at South Florida.

The fair takes place annually over four days at the Leipzig Trade Fairground in the northern part of Leipzig, Saxony. It is the first large trade meeting of the year and as such it plays an important role in the market and is often where new publications are first presented. History The Leipzig Book Fair became the largest book fair in Germany in 1632 when it topped the fair in Frankfurt am Main in the number of books presented. It remained on top until 1945 when Leipzig became part of socialist East Germany and Frankfurt, in West Germany surpassed it to regain the number one spot. During the East German era the fair remained an important meeting place for book lovers and sellers from both East and West Germany. After German Reunification, the fair moved from the Trade Fair House on the main market square to a new location removed from the city center. After the move, the fair experienced a renaissance and continues to grow today. Profile The Leipzig Book Fair in 2015 Today, the fair aims to be for the public, above all, and to emphasize the relationship between the authors and the fair's visitors. The new orientation is necessary to compete with Frankfurt Book Fair, which sees a much larger volume of industry trading. The Leipzig Fair was one of the first to recognize the growing market for audiobooks and incorporate this trend into its concept. =\\"Leipzig liest\\"= In parallel to the exhibitions, the Leipzig book fair is notable for its reading festival 'Leipzig liest'. During the four-day fair Leipzig hosts over 3,600 events (2018) both in various locations throughout the city and at the fairgrounds, making it the largest events of its kind in Europe. Awards The fair is the site of the presentation of several important German book prizes: The Leipzig Book Fair Prize (2002-2004 the German Book Prize), and the Leipzig Book Prize for European Understanding. The fair also sees the nominations for the Deutscher Jugendliteraturpreis Numbers In 2010 the fair experienced record attendance, registering 156,000 visitors and 2071 publishers from 39 countries.Leipziger Buchmesse endet mit Besucherrekord In 2012 there were 163,000 visitors.page of Leipzig Book Fair See also * Books in Germany References External links *Homepage of the Leipzig Bookfair Category:Events in Leipzig Category:Trade fairs in Germany Category:Book fairs in Germany Category:Tourist attractions in Leipzig ","title":"Leipzig Book Fair"},{"id":"10567918","text":"ƒ∞n√∂n√º may refer to.

Pargament , BGSU is an emeritus professor of psychology at Bowling Green State University (Ohio, USA).  Biography  Born in 1950Kenneth I. Pargament (2007). Spiritually integrated psychotherapy: Understanding and addressing the sacred. New York: Guilford Press. (birth year 1950 in LOC pub data) in Washington, D.C., Pargament received his Ph.D. from the University of Maryland in 1977.BGSU/Psychology faculty page - Kenneth I. Pargament He currently studies various relationships between religion, psychological well-being and stress, as well as other closely related subjects. He is also licensed in Clinical Psychology and has a private practice. Pargament has published over 200 papers on the subject of religion and spirituality in psychology. He is world- renowned for his scholarly contributions to the psychology of religion, and for providing clinically relevant scientific analyses of religion's role in mental health. Pargament has also written two books: The Psychology of Religion and Coping: Theory, Research, Practice (1997; see article),Kenneth I. Pargament (1997). The psychology of religion and coping: Theory, research, practice. New York: Guilford. and Spiritually Integrated Psychotherapy: Understanding and Addressing the Sacred (2007). Both of these seminal works provide a systematic program of empirical research, guided by theory, that is of practical relevance to helping professionals.  Research  One of Pargament's best known areas of research has pertained to Religious Coping, which involves drawing on religious beliefs and practices to understand and deal with life stressors. Pargament has also helped to design a questionnaire called the \\"RCOPE\\" to measure Religious Coping strategies.Kenneth I. Pargament, Harold G. Koenig & Lisa M. Perez (2000). The many methods of religious coping: Development and initial validation of the RCOPE. Journal of Clinical Psychology, v56 n4, pp519-543. The three methods of coping that are identified by the RCOPE are the deferring style, self-directing style, and collaborative style. The deferring style involves delegating all problem solving to God; the self-directing style is when the individual chooses to utilize the power God has given them to solve the problem on their own; and the collaborative style is implemented when the individual treats God as a teammate in the problem solving process. The collaborative style of religious coping has been found to have the greatest psychological benefits, correlating with increased self-esteem and lower levels of depression.Phillips III, R. E., Lynn, Q. K., Crossley, C. D., & Pargament, K. I. (2004). Self-Directing Religious Coping: A Deistic God, Abandoning God, or No God at All?. Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, 43(3), 409-418. Thus, Pargament's work has helped set the stage for a large scale program of research on this subject: currently there have been over 250 published studies on religious coping. Pargament's research also has helped psychologists learn how religious belief influences mental and physical health. For instance, he found that religious activity increased for Muslim-Americans after 9/11, and that in comparison with those who remained isolated and rejected by their religion, they experienced fewer symptoms of depression Abu-Raiya, H., Pargament, K. I., & Mahoney, A. (2011). Examining coping methods with stressful interpersonal events experienced by Muslims living in the United States following the 9/11 attacks. Psychology Of Religion And Spirituality, 3(1), 1-14. Similarly, he found that negative religious coping among AIDS patients was associated with an increase in HIV-related symptoms Cotton, S., Puchalski, C. M., Sherman, S. N., Mrus, J. M., Peterman, A. H., Feinberg, J., Kenneth I. Pargament, Amy C. Justice, Anthony C. Leonard, Tsevat, J. (2006). Spirituality and Religion in Patients with HIV/AIDS. Journal of General Internal Medicine, 21S5-S13. Pargament has described four major stances toward religion that have been adopted by psychotherapists in their work with clients. He called them the religiously rejectionist, exclusivist, constructivist, and pluralist stances.Brian J. Zinnbauer & Kenneth I. Pargament (2000). Working with the sacred: Four approaches to religious and spiritual issues in counseling. Journal of Counseling & Development, v78 n2, pp162-171. ISSN 0748-9633 He claims that the pluralistic approach is the best for clinicians because it recognizes the existence of a Supreme Being but allows for many interpretations of that reality.Zinnbauer, B. J., & Pargament, K. I. (2000). Working With the Sacred: Four Approaches to Religious and Spiritual Issues in Counseling. Journal of Counseling & Development, 78(2), 162-171. Furthermore, Pargament believes that religious discussions should become a greater part of the therapeutic process. He has advocated for religious guidebooks to be created for psychotherapists and that religious training be mandated. Pargament has also linked attribution theory to the psychology of religion, doing empirical research distinguishing between different forms of religious attribution.

As in his earlier work, The Jungle, Sinclair uses the novel to express his socialist viewpoint. The book is based on the 1913-1914 Colorado coal strikes and written just after the Ludlow massacre. The sequel to King Coal was posthumously published under the title, The Coal War. Plot Hal Warner, a rich young fellow determined to find the truth for himself about conditions in the mines, runs away from home and adopts the alias \\"Joe Smith.\\" After being turned away by one coal mine for fear of Hal being a union organizer, he gets a job in another coal mine operated by the General Fuel Company, or GFC. In the mines he befriends many of the workers, and realizes their misery and exploitation at the hands of the bosses. He befriends Mary Burke, who is a passionate fighter for the workers' rights. Her father is a mine worker who spends his days drinking and leaving her to take care of her siblings. She and Hal grow close, which tears at Hal's loyalty to his fianc√©e back home. After dedicating himself to the workers' cause, he tells them that he will appeal to the bosses to become a check weigh man who measures the amount of coal, but the GFC, wanting to cheat the workers out of their pay, appoints a company check weigh man. Hal is eventually put into the jail by the marshal, who is teased by Hal over conditions of the mines and accused by Hal of being corrupted and unfair to the workers. After an explosion in the mines, Hal seeks out Percy Harrigan, an old friend whose father, Peter Harrigan, owns the General Fuel Company. The workers organize a strike and union to demand their rights from the bosses, but the rescue effort goes longer than expected. The bosses are more intent on the tools and equipment than the miners. \\"Damn the man! save the Mules!\\" says a boss. Hal appeals to the United Mine Workers to back the strike, but they refuse, telling him that the strike is primitive and unexpected and that to support it when its just started to participate in action would waste the union's resources. Hal is told to wait a few more years for the other unions to strike, and only with a massive course of action could the unions win. Hal is left to tell the workers the grievous news but the workers nevertheless cheer out his name (some calling out Joe Smith and others Hal) for standing up for them. After a confrontation with his brother Edward, Hal resolves to return home and dedicate his life to the workers' cause. Hal leaves and concludes that he is in love with Mary Burke.

In the case of a battery electric vehicle, it means the total range per charge. For a plug-in hybrid (PHEV), it means the range of the vehicle in charge-depleting mode. PHEVs can travel considerably further in charge-sustaining mode which uses both on-board fuel and the battery pack. Calculating AER is made more complicated because of variations in PHEV design. A vehicle like the Fisker Karma that uses a serial hybrid design has a clear AER. Similarly a vehicle like the Chevrolet Volt which disengages the internal combustion engine (ICE) from the drive train while in electric mode has a clear AER, however blended mode PHEVs which use the ICE and electric motor in conjunction do not have a clear AER because they use gasoline and grid provided electricity at the same time. Equivalent AER is the AER of vehicles following this architecture. One example of this calculation can be found in Argonne National Labs report titled \\"TEST PROCEDURES AND BENCHMARKING Blended-Type and EV-Capable Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles.\\"http://www.transportation.anl.gov/pdfs/HV/457.pdf This procedure uses the formula below to calculate an equivalent AER for vehicles that operate in blended mode: :\\\\text{AER}_\\\\text{Equivalent} = \\\\left (1-\\\\frac{GPM_{CD} }{GPM_{CS} }\\\\right ) d^{CD} Where GPMCD designates efficiency in charge-depleting mode, and GPMCS charge-sustaining mode as designated and dCD is distance in charge depleting mode. A plug-in hybrid's all-electric range is designated by PHEV-(miles) or PHEV-(kilometers) km representing the distance the vehicle can travel on battery power alone. For example, a PHEV-20 can travel 20 miles without using its internal combustion engine, or about 32 kilometers, so it may also be designated as PHEV32km.

The species is native to Africa and the Middle East and has also been introduced to Pakistan and India.ILDIS LegumeWeb Common names include apple-ring acaciaC.Michael Hogan, ed. 2010. Faidherbia albida. Encyclopedia of Life. (their circular, indehiscent seed pods resemble apple rings), and winter thorn. The South African name is ana tree. Taxonomy This species has been known as Acacia albida for a long time, and is often still known as such. Guinet (1969) in Pondicherry first proposed separating it into the genus Faidherbia, a genus erected the previous century by Auguste Chevalier with this as the type species, seconded by the South African James Henderson Ross (1973) and the Senegalese legume botanist Nongonierma (1976, 1978), but authors continued to favour classification under Acacia as of 1997. =Infraspecific variability= According to John Patrick Micklethwait Brenan writing in the Flora of Tropical East Africa (1959), two forms can be distinguished in this region (Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda), race A is distinguished by generally smooth features, whereas race B is more hairy. Ross (1979) notes all trees in the south of central Tanzania belong to race B.FAO: Handbook on Seeds of Dry-Zone Acacias Similarly, Nongonierma described two forms for Senegal, var. glabra and var. pseudoglabra, but his distinction is disregarded taxonomically as of 2007. Description It is a thorny tree growing up tall and in trunk diameter. Its deep-penetrating tap root makes it highly resistant to drought. The bark is grey, and fissured when old. There are 11,000 seeds/kg. Distribution In Southern Africa it is absent throughout most of the territory, avoiding dry and upland areas or areas of winter rainfall, but occurs along the floodplains of the Zambezi and Limpopo, in Kruger National Park, Pongoland, around Gaberone, in the northern Okavango, the Caprivi Strip, Kakaoveld, western Gaza and Maputo Province. In the rest of Africa it is absent from deserts, areas of high rainfall, tropical rainforests and mountainous areas, but occurs throughout the eastern half of the continent from the southern coast in Maputaland to Egypt, throughout the Subsaharan Sahel and the Horn of Africa. In Northern Africa, besides in Egypt it also occurs in Algeria, it does not occur in Morocco proper, but it is found in Western Sahara. In Asia it is thought to be native to Yemen and Saudi Arabia in the Arabian Peninsula, Iran, and in the Levant in Israel, Syria and Lebanon. A population is found in relict groves in Israel (in the Shimron nature reserve, near the community settlement of Timrat). All of the trees in a given grove are genetically identical and seem to have multiplied by vegetative reproduction only, for thousands of years. Introduced populations are found on Cyprus and Ascension Island, and in Pakistan and Karnataka (India). Ecology In Southern Africa it usually grows on alluvial floodplains in bushveld, on riverbanks or flood pans, in swamps, or in dry watercourses that can flood during rains. It grows in woodland in the Sahel, along the Zambezi and in Sudan. In the Sahel it grows gregariously in groves. It grows in savannahs in Sudan and the Sahel, in heavy soils with good drainage. In tropical eastern Africa it sometimes occurs singly, but may often be the dominant species in dry woodlands. In the Sahel it has an irregular, clumped distribution, absent in some areas but is sometimes locally common. It grows in areas with of rain per year. Cultivation and uses Faidherbia albida is important in the Sahel for raising bees, since its flowers provide bee forage at the close of the rainy season, when most other local plants do not.World AgroForestry The seed pods are used for raising livestock, are used as camel fodder in Nigeria, and are eaten by stock and game in Southern Africa. They are relished by elephant, antelope, buffalo, baboons and various browsers and grazers, though strangely ignored by warthog and zebra. The wood is used for canoes, mortars, and pestles and the bark is pounded in Nigeria and used as a packing material on pack animals. The wood has a density of about 560 kg/m3 at a water content of 12%.FAO: Role of acacia species in the rural economy of dry Africa and the Near East The energy value of the wood as fuel is 19.741 kJ/kg. Ashes of the wood are used in making soap and as a depilatory and tanning agent for hides. The wood is used for carving; the thorny branches useful for a natural barbed fence.VITA (1977) Pods and foliage are highly regarded as livestock fodder. Some 90% of Senegalese farmers interviewed by Felker (1981) collected, stored, and rationed Acacia albida pods to livestock. Zimbabweans use the pods to stupefy fish. Humans eat the boiled seeds in times of scarcity in Zimbabwe. It is valued in agroforestry as it fixes nitrogen, and a high yield has been achieved in at least one test plot of maize crops grown amongst the trees at a density of 100 to 25 tree per hectare. According to a 2018 article by the Guardian, monocultures of this species are popular in parts of Niger, where it is known as gao in Hausa, to use for intercropping. It is also used for erosion control. = Medicinal uses = An extract is used to treat ocular infections in farm animals. The bark is used in traditional medicine in Southern Africa, and Niger. Branch with flowers Cultural significance Faiderbia albida is known in the Bambara language as balanzan and is the official tree of the city of Segou on the Niger River in central Mali.BBC News story on Mali's Faidherbia albida trees According to legend, Segou is home to 4,444 balanzan trees, plus one mysterious \\"missing tree\\" the location of which cannot be identified. In Serer and some of the Cangin languages, it is called Saas. Saas figures prominently in the creation myth of the Serer people. According to their creation myth, it is the tree of life and fertility. Gravrand, Henry, \\"La civilisation sereer\\", vol. II : Pangool, Nouvelles √©ditions africaines, Dakar, 1990, pp. 125‚Äì127, Conservation Faidherbia albida is not listed as being a threatened species. Notes  References  *Edmund G.C.Barrow. 1996.

Early life Symond was born on 17 August 1947 in Crookwell, New South Wales and raised in Sydney. He spent most of his time between Brisbane, where his mother's family lived, and Sydney, near his father's relatives. He was one of seven children and the son of Lebanese immigrant fruit shop owners, and regularly helped at his parents shop before and after school. He attended eleven different schools, including St Patrick's College, Strathfield, St Laurence's College, South Brisbane and Homebush Boys High School where he matriculated in 1965. After leaving school, Symond studied law and joined a firm in Bankstown where he learned conveyancing and specialised in property and finance. By the late 1980s, he had created a boutique financial services company, Mortgage Acceptance Corporation (MAC), that specialised in finding and providing commercial and investment loans to investors. One of Australia's first mortgage brokers, he eventually undertook a joint venture with a subsidiary of State Bank of South Australia, Beneficial Finance. When State Bank of South Australia went broke in the 1980s, he came within a whisker of bankruptcy, and it was this negative experience with a bank that formed the basis of the Aussie philosophy ‚Äì offering better deals and better customer service to everyday Australians. Aussie Home Loans Supported by a $10,000 loan from his older brother Michael, he founded Aussie Home Loans in February 1992 and was able to fulfil his ambition. Symond was widely credited with bringing competition to the Australian home lending industry and was the first major disruptor to the banks oligopoly of the Australian home loan market. The company was unique in its approach to home loans, offering 24 hours a day service and loans far cheaper than those offered by banks. In 1994 Aussie introduced securitisation to its home loans, allowing it to offer loans upwards of 3% cheaper than its competitors. In 2002, Aussie Home Loans diversified to become a mortgage broker ‚Äì offering bank and non-bank products. The company rapidly grew as consumers became aware of its products and that of other non-banks and the competition heated up. In August 2008 the Commonwealth Bank acquired a 33% stake in Aussie. Aussie acquired Wizard Home Loans in February 2009 and National Mortgage Brokers (nMB) in 2012. The Commonwealth Bank increased its investment in Aussie from 33 per cent to 80 per cent in May 2013, then to 100 per cent in August 2017. Symond remains the Chairman of Aussie with his nephew James Symond, the Chief Executive Officer. Personal life Symond's home Wingadal, in . Symond has two children, Stephen and Deborah.

Originally called the Army Corps of Central Kentucky, it was created in the fall of 1861 as a subsection of Department No. 2, and continued in existence until the end of March 1862 when it was absorbed and merged into the Army of Mississippi, which was then re-organized as the Army of Tennessee on November 20, 1862. Background The Department No. 2 (Western Department) was created on June 25, 1861, under the command of Maj. Gen. Leonidas Polk, and had military jurisdiction and control over parts of Alabama, Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana. On September 2, 1861, the Department was expanded to include all of Arkansas and military operations in the state of Missouri, and then on September 10 the area was expanded again to include all of Arkansas, Tennessee, more of Mississippi, and all military operations in Kansas, Kentucky, Missouri, and any Indian territories rallying to the Confederate cause west of Arkansas and Missouri.

Buckner Brig. Gen. Buckner assumed command of all forces in central Kentucky during September 1861 after having first served as a major general and commander of the Kentucky Militia. The forces were organized into two divisions with a reserve force. Later a third division under Brig. Gen. John B. Floyd was added. After Gen. Albert Sidney Johnston took command, Buckner continued to command a division of the Army of Central Kentucky at Bowling Green and Fort Donelson, where he surrendered. After being exchanged in August 1862, Buckner was promoted to major general and commanded a division with these same forces in the Army of Mississippi under the leadership of Gen. Braxton Bragg. Command under General Albert S. Johnston Gen. Johnston was in command of the Army of Central Kentucky from October 28, 1861, until March 29, 1862, with the exception of a two-week temporary command by Hardee in December. The area of operation for this army was designated as the part of Tennessee north of the Cumberland River and that part of Kentucky west of where the Cumberland River entered Tennessee to the east. On December 26, 1861, part of the Army of the Kanawha was added. On March 29, 1862, the army at about 23,000 men strong was merged into the Army of the Mississippi in preparation for the Battle of Shiloh. Command under Major General William J. Hardee Maj. Gen.

The system of sosloviyes was a peculiar system of social groups in the history of the Russian Empire. In Russian language the terms \\"—Å–æ—Å–ª–æ–≤–∏–µ\\" and \\"—Å–æ—Å—Ç–æ—è–Ω–∏–µ\\" (in the meaning of the civil/legal estate) were used interchangeably. Estates The Code of the Law of the Russian Empire of 1832, vol. 9, \\"Laws about Estates\\" (–ó–∞–∫–æ–Ω—ã –æ —Å–æ—Å—Ç–æ—è–Ω–∏—è—Ö) defined four major estates: dvoryans (nobility), clergy, urban dwellers and rural dwellers (peasants). The two former estates were non-taxable, the two latter were taxable estates (–ø–æ–¥–∞—Ç–Ω—ã–µ —Å–æ—Å–ª–æ–≤–∏—è), i.e., which had to pay the personal tax. The estates were classified into two major groups: , and ones. Within these, more detailed categories were recognized: # Nobility was subdivided into Hereditary nobility () which was transferred to wife, children, and further direct legal descendants along the male (agnatic) line, and Personal nobility () which could, for instance, be acquired by admission to orders of knighthood of the Russian Empire. It was transferable only to the wife. #Clergy was subdivided into \\"white\\" (priests) and \\"black\\" (monks). #Urban dwellers (–ì–æ—Ä–æ–¥—Å–∫–∏–µ –æ–±—ã–≤–∞—Ç–µ–ª–∏) were categorized into –ø–æ—Ç–æ–º—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–µ –ø–æ—á–µ—Ç–Ω—ã–µ –≥—Ä–∞–∂–¥–∞–Ω–µ (hereditary distinguished citizens), –ª–∏—á–Ω—ã–µ –ø–æ—á–µ—Ç–Ω—ã–µ –≥—Ä–∞–∂–¥–∞–Ω–µ(personal distinguished citizens), merchantry (:ru:–∫—É–ø–µ—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ), urban commoners (:ru:–º–µ—â–∞–Ω—Å—Ç–≤–æ), and guilded craftspeople (—Ü–µ—Ö–æ–≤—ã–µ —Ä–µ–º–µ—Å–ª–µ–Ω–Ω–∏–∫–∏). The institution of distinguished citizenship (of the above two categories) was introduced by the manifesto of Nicholas I of Russia of April 10, 1832. The distinguished citizens ranked above merchantry and below nobility. They were freed of personal taxes, military service obligation (—Ä–µ–∫—Ä—É—Ç—Å–∫–∞—è –ø–æ–≤–∏–Ω–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å), corporal punishments, etc. Distinguished citizenship was available for persons with a scientific or scholar degree, graduates of certain schools, people of arts and distinguished merchants and industrialists subject to certain conditions. Dependent families were usually included into the estate of the head of the household. Urban commoners included people who had some real estate in a town, were engaged in some trade, craft, or service, and paid taxes. Subject to these conditions, a person could assign himself into this category, which was hereditary, and one may be excluded from it in the court of law or by the urban commoner's self-government (–º–µ—â–∞–Ω—Å–∫–∞—è —É–ø—Ä–∞–≤–∞). Some of the category of rural dwellers (—Å–µ–ª—å—Å–∫–∏–µ –æ–±—ã–≤–∞—Ç–µ–ª–∏) had permanent residence in towns, and they were correspondingly classified as \\"urban peasants\\" (–≥–æ—Ä–æ–¥–æ–≤—ã–µ –∫—Ä–µ—Å—Ç—å—è–Ω–µ). #Peasantry- Rural dwellers who mainly subsisted on agriculture. This estate made up the great majority of the population and was obliged to provide the state with money in the form of taxes as well as young men to be trained as soldiers. #inorodtsy (–∏–Ω–æ—Ä–æ–¥—Ü—ã) estate, that included non-Russian and non-Orthodox native peoples of Siberia, Central Asia or Caucasus. As the Russian Empire expanded, different indigenous groups were granted privileges that differentiated them from the Russian peasantry, such as reduction or exemption of certain taxation, limited self-administration (including religious affairs), or exemptions from military service. An inorodets who converted to Orthodox Christianity was excluded from this estate and included into one of the other ones, most often peasantry, though sometimes allowed to maintain some of their privileges (such as exemption from military service or poll tax). There also existed the military estate, which included lower military ranks (higher ranks were associated with the estate of dvoryans), and discharged and indefinite-leave. A separate category, not assigned to any of the above estates were raznochintsy (literally \\"persons of miscellaneous ranks\\", but in fact having no rank at all). Finally, in Siberia, the estate of \\"exiled\\" was officially recognized, with the subcategory of \\"exiled nobility\\". With the development of capitalism and the abolishment of the serfdom in Russia in the second half of the 19th century the estate paradigm no longer corresponded to the actual socio-economical stratification of the population, but the terminology was in use until the Russian Revolution of 1917. At the same time the legal and governmental system gradually became estate- independent, with the property grade (–∏–º—É—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π —Ü–µ–Ω–∑) of a person playing the decisive role. Ranks A separate stratification existed for governmental bureaucracy, who were classified according to the Table of Ranks. The higher ranks belonged to the sosloviye of dvoryanstvo, while the indication of a lower rank of a person was comparable to that of the indication of a soslovie for various formal purposes (e.g., for the Russian Empire Census).

The album featured covers of songs by Azra, Zabranjeno Pu≈°enje, Riblja ƒåorba, Prljavo Kazali≈°te, Bijelo Dugme, Plavi Orkestar, but also by Bla≈æeviƒá's former band Fiskulturno Lane.

During the same year, on May 25, Bla≈æeviƒá organized a Youth Day celebration at the club Prostor which featured all the elements of rock culture from the socialist times. In October 1996, the band released their first studio album entitled Plagijati i obrade (Plagiarism and Covers) which featured covers of Jadranka Stojakoviƒá's \\"ƒåekala sam\\", Elvis J Kurtoviƒá's \\"Da bog da crk'o rokenrol (kad ga svako svira)\\", Mile Lojpur's \\"≈†umadijski tvist\\", the former featuring Lojpur on vocals.Plagijati i obrade at Discogs The album also featured new versions of Fiskulturno Lane songs \\"Vive Le France\\" and \\"Nema problema\\", the latter featuring Mi≈°ko Petroviƒá \\"Plavi\\" on keyboards.

In 1998 the band released their second studio album Seks, droga i BodirogaSeks, droga i Bodiroga at Discogs (Sex, Drugs, Bodiroga, referring to basketball player Dejan Bodiroga). Bla≈æeviƒá decided to name the album Seks, droga i Bodiroga, having seen this written as a graffiti, after FR Yugoslavia won the gold medal at the 1998 FIBA World Championship. The album featured hits \\"Dule Saviƒá 3\\", \\"Arigo Saki bluz\\" (which featured several lines from Riblja ƒåorba's \\"Evo ti za taksi\\" lyrics), \\"Lepa si Pamela\\" (dedicated to Pamela Anderson), \\"O kako gi sakam parite\\" (sung in Macedonian language) and the title track. This album featured only two covers, a cover of Adriano Celentano's \\"24.000 baci\\" and an unplugged cover of Azra song \\"Balkan\\" (Prljavi Inspektor Bla≈æa i Kljunovi version titled \\"Balkan anplagd\\"), the former being the recording of Bla≈æeviƒá's performance at the 1994 unplugged festival in Belgrade's Sava Centar. Bla≈æeviƒá and other members of the band soon formed the record label Kljun records, intending to release albums by bands from other former Yugoslav republics. =2000s= In 2000, the band released the live album Shipu ga ≈Ωobla!

In 2007 the band released the live album Samo Supermen Srbiju spa≈°ava (Only Superman Saves the Serbs, a parody of Serbian motto Samo sloga Srbina spasava). The album was recorded on December 8, 2006 in Coupe club in Panƒçevo, and featured three studio songs as bonus tracks: \\"Nisam dijamant\\", \\"Obeƒáo si mito (Bla≈æo bekrijo)\\" (a cover of Azra's version of song \\"Mito bekrijo\\" by folk music singer Hanka Paldum), and \\"Vranjanka\\". =2010s= In 2010, the band recorded the single \\"Alez 2010\\", a rerecorded version of the song \\"Alez Yugoslavia\\" featuring altered lyrics and song title, dedicated to the Serbia national football team, which at the time had played at the 2010 FIFA World Cup.

Lawlor is an American politician, criminal justice professor, and lawyer from Connecticut. A Democrat, he served as a member of the Connecticut House of Representatives from 1987 to 2011, representing the 99th district in East Haven. Lawlor resigned from the legislature on January 4, 2011 to serve in Dan Malloy's administration as undersecretary for criminal justice policy and planning at the Office of Policy and Management. Education Lawlor attended public schools in East Haven and graduated from East Haven High School. He was co-captain of the EHHS football team and was Vice-President of the Senior Class. He graduated as an Honors Scholar in Slavic and Eastern European Studies from the University of Connecticut in 1979. He earned a Master's Degree in Soviet Area Studies from the University of London in 1981 and he graduated from the George Washington University School of Law in 1983. He has also participated in language studies in Russia in 1977 and received a Fulbright-Hays Scholarship to study economic reform in Hungary in 1982. Career Following law school, Lawlor was appointed as a prosecutor for the State's Attorney Office in New Haven, where he served until his election to the Connecticut House of Representatives in 1986. He is currently a Professor of Criminal Justice at the University of New Haven's Henry C. Lee College of Criminal Justice and Forensic Sciences, and is also a Visiting Lecturer in Law at the Yale Law School. Politics =Judiciary Committee= Lawlor was co- chairman of the General Assembly's Judiciary Committee from 1995 to 2011. Prior to that, he was co-chairman of the Labor and Public Employees Committee where he played a major role in the reform of Connecticut's workers compensation program. As co-chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Lawlor played a key role in two amendments to the State of Connecticut constitution. The first established rights for victims of crime, the second eliminated the patronage-ridden county sheriff system. He was one of ten members of the legislature's Select Committee of Inquiry, which considered the possible impeachment of former Governor John G. Rowland. Rowland resigned on June 21, 2004 following the committee's hearings. He has also been a leader in efforts to enact workable gun control laws, to address racial disparities in the state's criminal justice system, to pass laws ending discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, to rewrite Connecticut's domestic violence laws, to reform the juvenile justice system, and to address prison overcrowding. =Civil union legislation= During the 2005 session of the legislature, Lawlor was one of the leaders in enacting Connecticut's civil unions law, which provided full state legal recognition to same sex couples who wish to be treated as married couples under the state's law. Connecticut was the first state to enact a civil union or same sex marriage law without a court order to do so. In March 2009 Lawlor and Sen. Andrew J. McDonald proposed a new state law proposing to regulate the management of Roman Catholic churches in Connecticut; free speech advocates, church leaders, and members of the Republican House opposition charged the bill violated the separation of church and state clause in the First Amendment. Bill Donahue, President of the Catholic League, an organization which fights anti-Catholic prejudice, called it a \\"brutal act of revenge by Lawlor and McDonald, two champions of gay marriage... designed to muzzle the voice of the Catholic Church\\". The Bill, by giving control over matters administrative and fiscal to a board of laity (in which the Bishop and Parish Priest would act only in an advisory capacity) and because it is specific only to the Roman Catholic Church is seen by many as anti-Catholic. The bill was tabled on March 10, 2009. Lawlor is a chair of the Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Project, an associate with the State Sentencing and Corrections Program at the Vera Institute of JusticeCenter on Sentencing and Corrections: Associates  Vera Institute of Justice in New York City, and a member of the National Resource Committee for the Center for Sex Offender Management within the United States Department of Justice. He is a member of the American Bar Association's Coalition for Justice, a national effort to build trust and confidence in the justice system. =Prison overcrowding= In the late 1990s Connecticut addressed its prison overcrowding issues by transferring inmates to prisons in Virginia. Rep. Lawlor strongly opposed this effort. In 2000 he told The Hartford Courant \\"this policy is more trouble than it's worth,\\" and that he wanted to \\"bring them back as soon as possible.\\" In 2003 the New York Times reported Lawlor favored replacing the Virginia facilities with \\"alternative ways of combating overcrowding, like making it harder to put people back in prison for technical violations of their parole, and argued that transfers should be a last resort.\\" Lawlor has long advocated what was called in 2004 a \\"controversial bill\\"http://www.nhregister.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=11104754&BRD;=1281&PAG;=461&dept;_id=31007&rfi;=6 which focused on the increased release of prisoners instead of expanding correctional facilities to handle the increased number of offenders entering the system. Thanks to Lawlor's vocal advocacy the bill was co-sponsored by both Republicans and Democrats, passed unanimously in the State Senate,Vote for HB-5211 Sequence Number 505 and only 9 out of 151 representatives in the House voted against it.Vote for HB-5211 Roll Call Number 266 The bill was then signed into law by Governor John G. Rowland. Lawlor's rationale was \\"The key is to resist doing the simple thing - dumping a bunch of money into a new prison,\\"State's Prison Population Not Projected To Increase The response, to expand the number of inmates paroled, became controversial following the July 2007 home invasion murders of the Petit family in Cheshire, Connecticut by two paroled convicts. On August 26, 2007 he defended the state's policy on paroles in a Hartford Courant article \\"Some people say let's put them all in jail. OK, fine, but that means dramatically increasing taxes or shutting down a bunch of colleges.\\" Due to the public outcry since the Petit murders, Lawlor agreed to hold hearings on Connecticut's parole system and called on state officials to investigate sites to build new prisons. \\"We are expected to receive information about the costs of these models and possible sites for new prison facilities,\\" he said. State officials and national criminal justice experts testified at the September 11 hearing, with Chief State's Attorney Kevin Kane labeling the existing data system for criminal justice \\"nonexistent.\\" Lawlor criticized the agencies for not having a system of communications among each other.http://www.courant.com/news/custom/topnews/hc- cheshire0912.artsep12,0,2806832.story?coll=hc_tab01_layout A hearing open to the public was held on November 27, 2007. Governor M. Jodi Rell announced on September 21, 2007 that there would be a moratorium on further parole of violent offenders. This occurred after a parolee with two prior kidnapping convictions carjacked a vehicle in Hartford and was later shot in a confrontation with New York City police. Lawlor supported her decision for a moratorium on parole and acknowledged this would require prompt efforts to expand prison space.http://www.courant.com/news/custom/topnews/hc- noparole-0921,0,3863424.story?coll=hc_tab01_layout He urged Governor Rell to explore the state's options for either expanding existing prisons, building new prisons, or sending prisoners out of state. The governor in response refused to do so, saying that new additional prison space is not necessary and reiterated her opposition to sending prisoners out of state.http://www.courant.com/news/custom/topnews/hc- rellparole0925.artsep25,0,5646776.story?coll=hc_tab01_layouthttp://www.nhregister.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=18850128&BRD;=1281&PAG;=461&dept;_id=31007&rfi;=6 Ironically, this placed Rell in the same position Lawlor had long held, as he had opposed sending Connecticut prisoners to Virginia prisons to ease overcrowding.http://www.wtnh.com/Global/story.asp?S=49287 In testimony before the Judiciary Committee at an emergency meeting convened by Lawlor in October, Department of Corrections Commissioner Teresa Lantz concurred with Governor Rell, testifying that her department does not need nor is requesting additional staff or new prisons Lawlor announced that he disagrees with Rell and Lantz, saying that the state should look into building a new prison, adding beds to existing facilities, or hiring more staff.http://www.courant.com/news/local/statewire/hc-16173052.apds.m0058.bc-ct --prisoct16,0,2951275.story Nonetheless, on December 12, 2007 he was quoted by the Associated Press as stating \\"Connecticut has a criminal justice system that already works pretty well.\\"http://ctlocalpolitics.net/2007/12/12/ct-is- safe-says-fbi-but-so-what =Three strikes law= A special session to enact tougher laws against home invasion and tighten the parole process was held January 22, 2008. A new law making home invasion a class A felony was passed, as well as reforming the parole board. Lawlor opposed efforts to pass a Three Strikes law in Connecticut, which was not passed. Governor Rell reiterated her call for a Three Strikes bill on March 31, 2008, following the kidnapping murder of an elderly New Britain woman committed by a career criminal recently released from Connecticut prison.http://www.ct.gov/governorrell/cwp/view.asp?Q=412458&A;=3293 He has served on the national drafting team for the Interstate Compact for Adult Offender Supervision and the Interstate Compact for Juvenile Probation and Parole. Recently, he served as a consultant for the United States Department of Justice assisting in the establishment of an adult probation system in Bulgaria. Personal Lawlor is openly gay.

Bystander intervention in emergencies: Diffusion of responsibility. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 8, 377‚Äì383. but he has also published many articles on social attraction in animals, social loafing in groups, and the spread of social influence in populations.  Biography  Latan√© received his B.A. from Yale in 1958 and his Ph.D. (under the mentorship of Stanley Schachter) from the University of Minnesota in 1963. He taught at Columbia University, the Ohio State University, Florida Atlantic University, and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. In the 1980s, he was director of UNC's Institute for Research in Social Science (now the Odum Institute). He is currently director of the Center for Human Science in Chapel Hill, NC, which he founded. Latan√©'s work with Darley involved a series of experiments that staged emergencies so that the social psychologists could observe how the presence of inactive bystanders affect the subjects' helping behavior. Latan√© was also instrumental in introducing ideas from dynamical systems theory into social psychology, demonstrating, for example, how various forms of order could emerge spontaneously in large social groups from individual's simple attempts to fit in with their local neighbors.Latan√©, B., & Bourgeois, M. J. (1996). Experimental evidence for dynamic social impact: The emergence of subcultures in electronic groups. Journal of Communication, 46, 35‚Äì47. He also developed the social impact theory, which holds that social influence is a function of the strength (S), the immediacy (I), and number (N) of sources present, or Impact = \\"f(SIN)\\". Together with Kipling Williams and Stephen Harkins, Latan√© introduced the term social loafing, a term that denotes people's tendency to slack off in groups due to the idea that one's personal contribution is unidentifiable. It is the opposite of social facilitation, which denotes arousal caused by the presence of others.

It is a derivative of aniline and is a member of the chloroacetanilide family of herbicides. It is highly effective toward grasses. Agricultural use Metolachlor was developed by Ciba-Geigy. Its acts by inhibition of elongases and of the geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) cyclases, which are part of the gibberellin pathway. It is used for grass and broadleaf weed control in corn, soybean, peanuts, sorghum, and cotton. It is also used in combination with other herbicides. Metolachlor is a popular herbicide in the United States.Kiely, T., D. Donaldson, and A. Grube. 2004. Pesticide industry sales and usage: 2000 and 2001 market estimates. US Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Pesticides Programs, Washington, DC As originally formulated metolachlor was applied as a racemate, a 1:1 mixture of the (S)- and (R)-stereoisomers. The (R)-enantiomer is less active, and modern production methods afford a higher concentration of S-metolachlor, thus current application rates are far lower than original formulations. Production and basic structure Metolachlor is produced from 2-ethyl-6-methylaniline (MEA) via condensation with methoxyacetone. The resulting imine is hydrogenated to give primarily the S-stereoisomeric amine. This secondary amine is acetylated with chloroacetylchloride. Because of the steric effects of the 2,6-disubstituted aniline, rotation about the aryl-C to N bond is restricted. Thus, both the (R)- and the (S)-enantiomers exist as atropisomers. Both atropisomers of (S)-metolachlor exhibit the same biological activity. The four stereoisomers of metolachlor  Safety and ecological effects  Metolachlor has been detected in ground and surface waters in concentrations ranging from 0.08 to 4.5 parts per billion (ppb) throughout the U.S. It is classified as a Category C pesticide by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA), which indicates limited evidence of carcinogenicity.USEPA,1987. Metolachlor Pesticide Registration Standard. Springfield, IL: Natl. Tech. Info. Serv. Evidence of the bioaccumulation of metolachlor in edible species of fish as well as its adverse effect on the growth and development raise concerns on its effects on human health. Though there is no set maximum concentration (maximum contaminant level, MCL) for metolachlor that is allowed in drinking water, the US EPA does have a health advisory level (HAL) of 0.525 mg/L. Metolachlor induces cytotoxic and genotoxic effects in human lymphocytes. Genotoxic effects have also been observed in tadpoles exposed to metolachlor. Evidence also reveals that metolachlor affects cell growth. Cell division in yeast was reduced,Echeverrigaray,S., Gomes,L.H., Taveres, F.C.A.(1999).

The eastern cougars were unofficially deemed extinct by a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service evaluation in 2011.https://www.fws.gov/northeast/ecougar/newsreleasefinal.html The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service formally removed the eastern cougar from the endangered species list and declared it to be extinct in 2018.https://www.fws.gov/northeast/ecougar/pdf/Cougar_News_Bulletin_Final_1_18.pdf The Canadian Wildlife Service has taken no position on the question. Cougars are still common in western North America; individuals from that population are occasionally seen in the eastern cougar's former range. History of taxonomy In 1792, Robert Kerr of the Royal Physical Society and Royal Society of Surgeons assigned the name Felis couguar to eastern North America cougars north of Florida. John Audubon in 1851 believed that cougars in both North and South America were indistinguishable. The eastern cougar was first assigned to the subspecies Felis concolor couguar and the Florida panther to F. c. coryi. Young and Goldman based their description of the eastern subspecies on their examination of eight of the existing 26 historic specimens. In 1955, Jackson described a new subspecies, the Wisconsin puma (F. c. schorgeri), from a small sample of skulls. A 1981 taxonomy by Hall accepted F. c. schorgeri, the Wisconsin puma, and also extended the range of the eastern puma into Nova Scotia and mapped the Florida panther's (F. c. coryi) range as far north as South Carolina and southwestern Tennessee.Hall, E.R. (1981). The Mammals of North America, Second edition. John Wiley and Sons, New York. In 2000, Culver et al., recommended that based on recent genetic research, all North American cougars be classified as a single subspecies, Puma concolor couguar following the oldest named subspecies (Kerr in 1792). The 2005 edition of Mammal Species of the World followed Culver's recommendations. This revision was made by Dr. W. Chris Wozencraft of Bethel University, Indiana, as the sole reviewer. However, the publication's Web site as of 2011, as well as that of its affiliate, the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, continued to maintain the Puma concolor couguar (both western and eastern cougars) as a subspecies of Puma concolor.Puma concolor . Mammal Species of the World. Bucknell.edu. Judith Eger, a scientist at the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto, Ontario, and the chair of the American Society of Mammalogists checklist committee, believes that the Culver work was not a proper taxonomic revision, as it offered no evaluation of the existing subspecies of the puma and failed to include morphological, ecological, and behavioral considerations. According to Eger, the Culver revision is accepted only by some puma biologists. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) continues to accept the Young and Goldman taxonomy. \\"While more recent genetic information introduces significant ambiguities, a full taxonomic analysis is necessary to conclude that a revision to the Young and Goldman (1946) taxonomy is warranted,\\" the agency said in 2011. As of 2017, the Cat Classification Taskforce of the Cat Specialist Group recognizes only two cougar subspecies: P. c. couguar for North America and possibly northwestern South America, and P. c. concolor for all other South American populations. Uncertainty of survival A consensus exists among wildlife officials in 21 eastern states that the eastern cougar population has been extirpated from the eastern United States. The federal government of Canada has taken no position on the subspecies' existence, continued or otherwise, and terms the evidence \\"inconclusive.\\" The FWS reviewed all available research and other information, and concluded in 2011 that the eastern cougar has been extinct since the 1930s, and recommended that it be removed from its list of endangered species. The agency used the 1946 taxonomy of S.P. Young and E.A. Goldman in defining the eastern cougar subspecies. While noting that some taxonomists in recent years have classified all North American cougars within a single subspecies, the agency's 2011 report said, \\"a full taxonomic analysis is necessary to conclude that a revision to the Young and Goldman (1946) taxonomy is warranted.\\" The agency acknowledged the occasional presence of cougars in eastern North America, but believes these are of wanderers from western breeding ranges or escaped captives. Its review expressed skepticism that breeding populations exist north of Florida, noting, among other things, the lack of consistent road kill evidence comparable to known cougar ranges. However, the presence of cougars in the wild ‚Äî whatever their taxonomy or origin ‚Äî in eastern North America continues to be controversial. Various residents of eastern North America, especially in rural regions, have reported as many as 10,000 cougar sightings since the 1960s, and many continue to believe the subspecies has survived. Bruce Wright ‚Äî a wildlife biologist and former student of Aldo Leopold ‚Äî popularized the idea that a breeding population of cougars persisted in northern New England and the Maritime provinces through a series of articles and books published between 1960 and 1973. Wright based his idea mostly on unconfirmed sightings, track photos, and plaster casts, and photographs of pumas killed in New Brunswick in 1932 and in Maine in 1938.Bolgiano, C. (1995). Mountain lion: An unnatural history of pumas and people. Stackpole Books, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, . Since the 1970s, privately run groups have formed in nearly every state to compile and investigate records of cougar sightings. Many of these groups are convinced that breeding populations of cougars exist throughout the region. Some believe that a conspiracy to hide information or secretly reintroduce cougars is actively underway by state and federal governments. Some endeavor to promote the recovery of cougars in eastern North America. Large numbers of cougar sightings have been reliably reported throughout the Midwest. =Possible colonization of the east by western cougars= At least several dozen or more reported sightings have been confirmed by biologists, many of whom believe they are accounted for by escaped captives or individual members of the western subspecies that have wandered hundreds of miles from their established breeding ranges in the Dakotas or elsewhere in the west. Eastern U.S. reported sightings, many of which reviewed in the recent federal report, in various locations, including Michigan, Wisconsin, Southern Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky, Connecticut, New York Maine, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Virginia, Arkansas, Vermont, Alabama Louisiana, and Tennessee.Tennessee Officials Confirm First Cougar Sighting in 100 Years, Field & Stream Until around 1990, reports of mountain lions in the Midwest and East were highly influenced by the \\"Bigfoot factor\\", according to Mark Dowling, co-founder of the Eastern Cougar Network. \\"None of it was really real\\", he said in an interview, but the situation has changed dramatically since that time according to Dowling, whose group collects and disseminates data on the shifting mountain lion population. Dowling said in 2003 that sightings in the eastern half of the nation, including Michigan, etc., were \\"almost certainly\\" escaped captives, but he added that the notion that (western) cougars \\"will eventually reach New Jersey\\" is a reasonable prediction, in part due to increased populations of white-tailed deer. However, some of these cougars found far in the east were established to be of western origin. As noted in an opinion piece by David Baron in the New York Times, concerning a cougar killed by a car in Connecticut in 2011: > \\"Wildlife officials, who at first assumed the cat was a captive animal that > had escaped its owners, examined its DNA and concluded that it was a wild > cougar from the Black Hills of South Dakota. It had wandered at least 1,500 > miles before meeting its end at the front of an SUV in Connecticut.\\" Recolonization is entirely dependent upon dispersing subadult females, who typically range far less than subadult males. While subadult females with Black Hills DNA have been documented since 2015 in Tennessee, Missouri and Iowa, as of 2018, the easternmost breeding colony north of Florida is the Niobrara River Valley in central Nebraska.Nebraska Game & Parks: http://outdoornebraska.gov/mountainlions/ =Canadian views= A 1998 study for Canada's national Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada concluded \\"that there is no objective evidence (actual cougar specimens or other unequivocal confirmation) for the continuous presence of cougars since the last century anywhere in eastern Canada or the eastern United States outside of Florida.\\"Scott, F.W. (1998). Update of COSEWIC status report on cougar (Felis concolor couguar), eastern population. Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada, Environment Canada, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Based on this, in 1999, the magazine Canadian Geographic reported that for the previous half century, a debate over whether or not Canada's eastern woods host a cougar species all its own has raged. \\"Now the answer appears to be 'no.' Experts say past sightings were cases of mistaken identification.\\" However, the Canadian committee's website as of 2011 says that data are \\"insufficient\\" to draw conclusions regarding the subspecies‚Äô continued existence, or even whether it ever existed at all. In March 2011, an official with the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources stated that cougars are present in the province.Mountain lion (Cougar), Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry This official said individual cougars in Ontario may be escaped zoo animals or pets or may have migrated from the western parts of North America. As in the eastern U.S., numerous cougar sightings have been reported by Canadians in Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland. The privately run Ontario Puma Foundation estimates that 550 pumas are in the province and their numbers are increasing steadily to a sustainable population. However, no evidence of breeding has been documented east of Saskatchewan.Klandagi/Cougar Rewilding Foundation: Correspondence with Manitoba/Saskatchewan biologists, March/2017 =Extinction recognized= In 2011, the FWS opened an extensive review into the status of the eastern cougar. In 2015, the agency determined the eastern cougar no longer warranted protection under the Endangered Species Act and planned to de-list it. On January 22, 2018 the de-listing became final and they were officially declared extinct. According to the Center for Biological Diversity, \\"The eastern cougar was extinct well before it was protected under the Endangered Species Act, as was the case with eight of the other 10 species that have been de-listed for extinction.\\" Genetic study In 2015, a group of students and scholars at the Pennsylvania State University formed a research group to sequence the mitochondrial DNA genome of this extinct subspecies. The Nittany Lion genome project took samples from preserved eastern cougar skins to obtain DNA for sequencing and further analysis. Complete mitochondrial DNA genome sequences were obtained for five of the six individuals sampled, and the results were compared to previously published cougar sequences. The researchers found that \\"Nittany Lions are not more similar to each other than to individuals from the Western U.S. and Florida\\", which only strengthens the position that all North American cougars are a single subspecies.

He is the 36th mathadhis of Shri Ramachandrapura Math, the only unbroken lineage of Adi Shankara. He took sannyasa from Raghavendra Bharati, the previous mathadhis, in April 1994. He is a follower of Advaita Vedanta. Birth and childhood Sri Bharathi in his early days before taking initiation was known by the name Hareesha Sharma. He was born in the village called Chaduravalli in Sagara, Karnataka .  Education He studied Vedantha, Yoga, Astrology and Sanskrit in Gokarna and later in Mysore. Sannyasa and after On 28 April 1999, Sri Bharati was made pontiff following the sadgati of Sri Sri Raghavendra Bharathi Swamiji Religious thought and social responsibility He stresses the need to protect Vedic culture, and its activities along with other social activities. One of the plans instituted by him in the Mutts is Musti Bikshe Yojana wherein each devotee keeps a fist full of rice daily as gift to the Mutt, and collectively later feeds the needy and hunger, as old age orphans, hostels for homeless or at the time of natural calamity, etc. He frequently conducts Rama Katha (Story of Rama) for the general public ‚Äî a blend of discourse, dance, music and drawing ‚Äî all that depict various incidents of Ramayana at various places. =Eye hospital= He established the Bharathiya Nethra Chikitshalya in Mujangavu, Kumbla in Kasaragod dist, to cater the need of rural eye patients, criss-crossing the boundaries of religion in social service. =Preventing Mining at Ambaragudda= Bharathi led a protest march by environmentalists against mining in and around Kodachadri. For opposing mining activities, he has to face the ire of mining agencies. Under his Project Vanajeevana Yajna, thousands traditional and medicinal plants have been planted. Citizens are encouraged to plant at least five saplings every year under the project. At 2003, Manganese mining activities started at Ambaragudda (Kodachadri, Karnataka), situated at western ghats (India). Mine owners promised to build hospitals, roads for locals and got an approval for mining of 18 acres. But, they unearthed hundreds of acres of land unofficially. Sri Raghaveshwara Bharathi Swamiji of Ramachandrapura Mutt came to know about this matter and decided to fight against mining at Ambaragudda.http://www.bangalorewaves.com/articles/bangalorewaves-article- details.php?val1=OTA2 He personally visited the place, looked at the casualty and created a stage called Kodachadri Sanjeevini to fight against mining. He brought locals, Forest officials, local MLAs into this stage and protested all over the place. As a result of this movement, forest department forfeit mining machines, equipments and stopped mining activities at Ambaragudda. Officials from Ministry of Environment visited the place and agreed upon casualty done to the environment. State High Court ordered to stop mining activities and encouraged to protect environment. On 16.05.2005, locals and devotees of mutt planted new plants at Ambaragudda. Swamiji had a life threat in this case and Karnataka State Government had appointed a gun man for his security.

Some rare breeds as Amrithmahal, Vechur, which count less than 100 in numbers, are protected here. He has been working stressing the need to promote products other than milk products, as Go-ark, medicines from cow, Doopa, etc. He also led and inspired the 108-day-long (30 September 2009 ‚Äì 17 January 2010 ) 'Vishwa Mangala Gou Grama Yathra‚Äô with the support of various saints and Hindu organizations. The yathra covered the whole of India to highlight the importance of preservation and protection of cow with demands such as to declare cow as the national animal of India and to formulate laws to preserve various breeds of Indian cows. It ended with the one of the biggest mass signature campaign signed by over 83 million people across India calling for the end of cruelty to cow and to declare cow a national animal which is then submitted to President of India on 31 January 2010.

In 2006, the iwi registered 11,808 members, representing 13 hap≈´. History =Early history= Apanui Ringamutu's mother Rongomaihuatahi was descended from Porourangi of the Horouta canoe, who was a founder of NgƒÅti Porou. His father T≈´rƒ´rangi was a descendant of Tamatekapua of the Te Arawa canoe, and the NgƒÅriki people of the Tauira canoe. When Rongomaihuatahi took Apanui to meet his relatives at ≈åmƒÅio, they gave land to the boy. Because of his noble ancestry, the people in that area were named after him: Te WhƒÅnau-ƒÅ-Apanui (the family of Apanui). During the 17th century, Apanui acquired vast amounts of land along the East Coast of the North Island. Through familial connection, he acquired land from NgƒÅti Porou and NgƒÅriki. He was given land extending from P≈çtikirua to Puketapu, and from Taumata-≈ç-Apanui Hawai; the land in between was later won through conquest. =Modern history= Relations with Europeans were not generally hostile. Early European settlers showed little interest in the isolated region, which lacked deep-water harbours for shipping. However, visiting Europeans taught Te WhƒÅnau-ƒÅ-Apanui the skills of whaling and commercial agriculture. Both areas become major economic industries for the iwi in the early 20th century, and profits were directed into community development projects. During the 1980s, the iwi experienced economic decline with the loss of major transport services, privatization of state assets and the eventual economic unfeasibility of its small-scale farming operations. This resulted in some emigration of iwi members from traditional tribal homelands. Hap≈´ and marae The iwi (tribe) consists of 13 hap≈´ (sub-tribes).

At the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, Quebec, he won the 200-meter freestyle and was a member of the winning U.S. team in the 4√ó200-meter freestyle relay, both in world record time.2001 Inductees For USC Athletic Hall of Fame Announced Swimming career Furniss broke ten world and nineteen American records, and won eleven Amateur Athletic Union and six NCAA titles. He was an integral part of USC's NCAA National Collegiate Championship winning teams of 1976 and 1977. While at USC, Furniss was coached by the legendary Peter Daland, who guided the school's men's swimming team to nine National Titles in his 35 years as the school's coach (1957 to 1992). =1976 Olympics= Furniss was a member of the 1976 U.S. Olympic men's swimming team, a team regarded by most sports historians as the most dominating Olympic sports team ever assembled, winning 12 of 13 (92%) possible gold medals and 27 of 35 (77%) possible total medals. Furniss won Olympic gold in the 200-meter freestyle, (one of three Americans to ever win this Olympic event; Mark Spitz in 1972 and Michael Phelps in 2008 being the other two), and the 4√ó200-meter freestyle relay, setting world records in each event. In the 200-meter freestyle he led an American sweep finishing ahead of fellow Americans John Naber (silver) and Jim Montgomery (bronze). He teamed up with Naber, Montgomery and Mike Bruner on the 4√ó200-meter freestyle relay. =World championships= Furniss also garnered two gold and two silver medals in the 1975 World Aquatics Championships in Cali, Colombia and 1978 World Aquatics Championships in West Berlin. =World records= As a 7-year-old in 1964, Furniss was inspired by the four gold medal performance of American swimmer Don Schollander, who broke the 200-meter freestyle world record ten times during his career. Eleven years later, Furniss became the twelfth of fourteen Americans in history to break the 200-meter freestyle world record. During his career he broke the 200-meter freestyle world record four different times. Furniss laid claim to the 200-meter freestyle world record from 1975 to 1979. =Sibling rivalry= Furniss is the third of four successful aquatic brothers, often referred to as \\"Orange County California's First Family of Swimming.\\" Older brother Steve Furniss, a two-time swimming Olympian (1972 Olympic bronze medalist and 1976 Olympic team captain), and Bruce are among a rare group of siblings, in any sport, to make the same Olympic team. The decision by the International Olympic Committee to remove the 200-meter individual medley from the 1976 Summer Olympics robbed Bruce and Steve of the unique opportunity to compete against each other in an Olympic swimming event. However, Bruce and Steve share the distinction as the only known brothers ever to have held and broken one another's world records consecutively. In August of 1975 at the United States Swimming National Championships, Bruce broke Steve's 200-meter individual medley world record in a race in which Steve also competed. In that same meet, Bruce and Steve, swimming for Long Beach Swim Club, shared the equally unique accomplishment, (along with teammates Tim Shaw and Rex Favaro), as the last swim club team to break a swimming relay world record (4√ó200-meter freestyle relay). Earlier that same summer at the 1975 World Swimming Championships team trials, Furniss also accomplished the rare feat of breaking the same world record twice in the same day (June 18, 1975) in the 200-meter freestyle. From 1973 to the end of his career in 1980, while swimming for Long Beach Swim Club, Furniss was coached by two International Swimming Hall of Fame (ISHOF) coaches, Dick Jochums and Jon Urbanchek. Prior to their 1973 arrival at Long Beach Swim Club, The Furniss Brothers were coached by another ISHOF inducted coach, Ralph \\"Flip\\" Darr, who also coached Gary Hall Sr. and Shirley Babashoff while at Huntington Beach Aquatic Club. =Olympic schedule changes= Notably, Furniss's dream of winning a third, and, quite possibly, a fourth Olympic Gold Medal was thwarted when the International Olympic Committee removed the 200-meter individual medley and the 4√ó100-meter freestyle relay (an event the United States had won in all three previous Olympics and both World Championships) from the 1976 Summer Olympics. As the reigning 200-meter individual medley world record-holder from 1975 through 1977, Furniss was the apparent favorite for the event's 1976 Olympic gold medal. Furniss was also United States' third fastest swimmer in the 100-meter freestyle in 1975, and was a member of the world champion and world record-holding quartet (Furniss, Andy Coan, Jim Montgomery & John Murphy) in the 4√ó100-meter freestyle relay, an event the Americans were favored to win in 1976 had the race been swum. Ironically both events were permanently reinstated into the Olympic program eight years later. Awards and recognition Furniss was twice named World Swimmer of the Year by Swimming World Magazine, once in 1975, and again in 1976. In 1974 and 1975, Furniss was awarded the prestigious Robert J. H. Kiphuth Award as the country's high point winner at the United States Swimming National Championships. He was inducted into the Orange County Sports Hall of Fame in 1984, and as an \\"Honor Swimmer\\" in the ISHOF in 1987,International Swimming Hall of Fame, Honorees, Bruce Furniss. Retrieved March 17, 2015. and the University of Southern California Athletic Hall of Fame in 2001. Furniss also participated in carrying the Olympic flame as a participant of the 1984, 1996 and 2004 Olympic Torch Relays in the Los Angeles area. In April 2000, Furniss was selected to \\"USA Swimming's Swim Team of the 20th Century\\", an honor bestowed on only 26 U.S. male swimmers deemed to be the best of the best in the 20th century. In January 2004, Furniss received the NCAA's Silver Anniversary Award. The award is presented annually to six former collegiate athletes in recognition of their 25 years of post-graduate career achievements, contributions to professional organizations, and charitable and civic activities within their community. In February 2016, both Furniss brothers were selected to the Pac-12 Conference's All-Century Men's Swimming and Diving Team, recognizing them among the Conference's 32 best swimmers in the previous 100 years. In 2018, Furniss was cited as one of the top 100 swimmers of all-time in John Lohn's book entitled \\"The 100 Greatest Swimmers in History.\\" Both Furniss brothers were inducted into the Long Beach, CA's Aquatic Capital of America Hall of Fame in 2019. Furniss was inducted as one of four former collegiate athletes into the CoSIDA (College Sports Information Directors of America) Academic All-American Hall of Fame Class of 2020, one of only 158 Academic All-Americans so recognized since its inception in 1988. Personal life Furniss is a 1975 graduate of Tustin, California's Foothill High School where he was coached by Tom Delong, California Interscholastic Federation's all-time winningest high school swim coach. He graduated in 1979 from USC's Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism with a bachelor's degree in journalism. Upon his retirement from swimming in 1980, Furniss worked in sports marketing and public relations and wrote for Swimming World Magazine. During this time he performed account work for Manning, Selvage & Lee and Burson-Marsteller, two of the world's largest public relations firms. Most of his work involved supporting the marketing efforts of several major corporate sponsors of the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles, CA, Since 1985, Furniss has been self-employed as a commercial real estate broker. He is a Managing Director with Berkadia in Irvine, CA, has transacted over $1.5B in multi-family real estate, and possess a core competency as an affordable housing specialist. Furniss is married and resides in Villa Park, California. He is the father of three sons and a daughter, whom like Furniss, each attended USC. Two of his sons played water polo for the Trojans, each playing on teams winning the NCAA Men's Water Polo Championship Title in 2012 & 2018\\\\. Throughout much of his prime swimming career, Furniss became noted for achieving athletic success in spite of waging a quiet and very personal battle against the crippling arthritic disease, Ankylosing Spondylitis. On March 29, 2020, while asleep at home, Furniss suffered a cardiac arrest. He was admitted to St. Joseph‚Äôs Hospital in Orange, California where he was treated with therapeutic hypothermia (medically induced cooling) and eventually released on April 9, 2020.

It was originally published in the first Beaumont and Fletcher folio of 1647. Uncertainties of the play's date, authorship, and sources make it one of the most widely disputed works in English Renaissance drama. Date The Fair Maid of the Inn was licensed for performance by Sir Henry Herbert, the Master of the Revels, on 22 January 1626 (new style). In his records, Herbert specifically attributes the play to Fletcher, who had died in August 1625. The play is thought to have been acted by the King's Men, the company Fletcher served as house playwright--though firm data on its performance history are lacking. Authorship Inconsistencies in the play's internal evidence, notably the lack of Fletcher's highly distinctive pattern of textual preferences (ye for you, 'em for them, etc.) through much of the play, made early scholars realize that the play was, like the majority of the works in Fletcher's canon, a collaboration. Individual critics argued in favor of a range of potential collaborators, including Philip Massinger, John Ford, John Webster, and William Rowley.E. H. C. Oliphant, The Plays of Beaumont and Fletcher: An Attempt to Determine Their Respective Shares and the Shares of Others, New Haven, Yale University Press, 1927; pp. 463-72.H. Dugdale Sykes, Sidelights on Elizabethan Drama, London, Oxford University Press, 1924; pp. 140-58. These arguments depend upon literary parallels and the distinctive textual preferences of the different authors; for example, Ford's pattern of unusual contractional forms (like t'ee for to ye,) is present in some scenes but absent from others. The play appears to have been a late work by Fletcher, perhaps left unfinished at his death, that was later completed by others and perhaps revised during the two decades between 1625 and 1647. Cyrus Hoy, in his sweeping evaluation of authorship questions in Fletcher's canon, argued that the hands of Massinger, Fletcher, Ford, and Webster are all detectable in the extant text. He assigned shares this way:Terence P. Logan and Denzell S. Smith, eds., The Later Jacobean and Caroline Dramatists: A Survey and Bibliography of Recent Studies in English Renaissance Drama, Lincoln, NE, University of Nebraska Press, 1978; pp. 79-80. :Massinger -- Act I; Act V, scene 3a (to Host's entrance); :Webster -- Act II; Act IV, 2; Act V, 1, 2, and 3b (from Host's entrance); :Ford -- Act III; :Fletcher and Ford -- Act IV, 1. Other scholars prefer their own divisions and analyses.Logan and Smith, pp. 144-5. The possibility of revision has effected the question of the play's genre; some critics would define it as a tragicomedy. One scholar, Bertha Hensman, argued that an original comedy by Fletcher and Rowley was shifted into a tragicomic form by Massinger as reviser.Logan and Smith, p. 80. Sources The play's plot derives from the historical feud of the Bianchi and Neri factions in late medieval Florence. The white (Bianchi) and black (Neri) Guelph factions were in part family-based --respectively, the Cerchi family and the Donati. The disputed origins of the factions were by some accounts rooted in the rivalry of two lovers of Bianca Cancellieri; her name suggested the Biancha in this play. The factions are most famous for their role in the life of Dante Alighieri; when the Neri took power in Florence in 1301, Bianchi like Dante were exiled. Some critics believed that the source for the play was The Illustrious Handmaid (La ilustre fregona) by Miguel de Cervantes; others, however, have argued that the playwright(s) could have accessed the same historical material in other sources. Other possible sources include the Florentine History (Istorie fiorentine) by Niccol√≤ Machiavelli and the Excerpta Controversarium of Seneca the Elder.Logan and Smith, pp. 38-9. Synopsis The plot of the play concerns the intertwined fortunes of two prominent Florentine families. Alberto is the Admiral of Florence; he is married to Mariana; their children are Cesario and Clarissa. Baptista, another old sailor, is a friend of Alberto, and father of Mentivole; like their fathers, Cesario and Mentivole are friends. Alberto's is a stable nuclear family; Mariana is a doting mother, especially in regard to Cesario. Baptista's situation is less happy: fourteen years earlier, he, a widower in his prime, contracted a secret marriage with Juliana, a niece of the Duke of Genoa. After a short three months of contentment, the Genoese duke discovered the marriage, exiled Baptista, and sequestered Juliana. He has not seen her since. This situation is delineated in the play's long opening scene. At the scene's opening, Cesario warns Clarissa to safeguard her virginity and her reputation; but Clarissa responds by reproving her brother about his rumored affair with Biancha, the thirteen- year-old daughter of a local tavernkeeper (she's the \\"fair maid\\" of the title). Cesario protests that his connection with the girl is above reproach: Biancha, he says, is beautiful but chaste. By the scene's close, Mentivole expresses his love for Clarissa; she responds positively, and gives him a diamond ring as a token of her affection and commitment. Friends though they are, Cesario and Mentivole have a falling-out over a horse race; they quarrel, lose their tempers, and draw their swords to fight. They are separated by other friends, but only after Cesario is wounded. The affair escalates into a major feud between the two families. Alberto is called away by his naval duties, and is soon reported dead. Mariana fears that her son will be killed in the feud; to prevent this, she announces (falsely) to the Duke and his court that Cesario is not really Alberto's son. Early in their marriage, she maintains, Alberto had wanted an heir, but the couple did not conceive. Mariana exploited her husband's absences at sea to pass off a servant's child as her own. Thus he is no longer Alberto's son, and safe from Baptista's enmity. But the Duke sees the injustice done against Cesario, and decrees that the now-widowed Mariana should marry the young man, and endow him with three- quarters of Alberto's estate; the remaining share will serve as Clarissa's dowry. Cesario is amenable to this arrangement--but Mariana assures him that any marriage between them will never be consummated. Cesario proposes a marriage between himself and Clarissa, though both women reject the idea out of hand. And even Biancha turns against Cesario, when she comes to understand that he is not serious about marrying her. Eventually matters are set right when Alberto returns to Florence. Not dead, he was instead captured by the Turks, but rescued by Prospero, a captain in the service of Malta. Prospero is an old friend of both Alberto and Baptista; he is able to inform the world of the fate of Juliana, and the daughter that Alberto didn't know he had. She is Biancha, the supposed daughter of the tavernkeeper. This good news allows the compounding of all the previous difficulties; the quarrel between Alberto and Baptista is resolved, Cesario is restored to his rightful place as Alberto's son, and he and Biancha can marry, as can Mentivole and Clarissa. The play has a comic subplot centered on Biancha, her supposed parents the Host and Hostess of the tavern, and their quests. The comedy features a mountebank and his clownish assistant, and their victims. The play's storytelling is rough and rather inconsistent, most likely due to the multiple hands involved in its authorship.

We do not have any plan for localize to the other versions.\\", despite the game originally having official sites in English, Chinese, and Korean. These were taken offline when the Japanese language site was rewritten to focus on the upcoming sequel game. A manga adaptation was published in Akita Shoten's \\"Champion Red\\" starting in September 2007. It was illustrated by Ken Yagami. Reception According to online retailer Amazon.com, the game is the best selling pre-order game in Japan, and is more popular than The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass. However the actual numbers show that the game met with minimal sales and as of 2009 has only sold 50,000 units. Although the game was never commercially released in North America, it was the subject of a number of webcomics and internet shows. These include: *A Penny Arcade comic in April 2007. *Two Dueling Analogs comics, one in March 2008. and another in December 2008 *Used as an example of \\"child molestation\\" games in a list of bad types of video games and also mentioned to highlight the cultural differences between the west and Japan in the popular videogame reviews, Zero Punctuation. The import review in NGamer (like its predecessor NGC Magazine, famous for comical reviews of particularly bad games), was so disturbed by the game that it abandoned its normal percentage scoring system and awarded it a 'score' of simply \\"NO\\" in every category. In a later issue (18) it \\"awarded\\" it \\"The Superman 64 Award For Worst Game (of 2007)\\" (for years, the magazine considered Superman 64 to be the worst game ever made), remarking \\"There are bad games - technically flawed and conceptually lazy - and then there are bad games. Evil bad. Doki Doki a.k.a. The Meh Witch Touching Project, is one such title.\\" The sequel, however, received 40%, an actual score. Sequels =Doki Doki Majo Shinpan 2 Duo= is the sequel to the Japan-exclusive Doki Doki Majo Shinpan!. A third game titled Doki Majo Plus was released on July 30, 2009. Similarly to the first game, players determine whether female characters are witches by touching their bodies with the stylus. However, unlike its predecessor, this title exhibits new features such as an enhanced witch-check touching system and microphone input. The game resumes with Akuji, the main character of the first game, this time in high school. The game is rated D (17 years and over) in Japan by the CERO because of the nudity and sexual references presented in the game. =Doki Majo Plus= Doki Majo Plus is the third game in the Doki Doki Majo Shinpan! series. Despite being billed as the third game in the series, it's really an enhanced retelling of the original DokiMajo game, featuring a revised soundtrack and a new character. The game was released only in Japan on July 30, 2009.

He was the brother-in-law of missionary explorer David Livingstone. He is known for his various publications and essays detailing his journeys and experiences in Africa and the eastern Mediterranean. Like his famous father, Moffat was a Congregationalist minister affiliated with the London Missionary Society but he became involved in British colonial expansion particularly in Matabeleland, later part of Southern Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe. His missionary work included helping to start the first mission in Matabeleland in 1859 at Inyati. In 1865 he took over the running of his father's mission in Kuruman. In 1879 he resigned from the missionary society and joined the British Bechuanaland colonial service. In 1888 at the instigation of Cecil Rhodes he was sent to Matabeleland to use his father's reputation to persuade its king Lobengula to sign a treaty of friendship with Britain and to look favorably on Rhodes' later approach for the Rudd Concession mining rights. Moffat discovered later the extent of Rhodes' deception of Lobengula and the deceit behind numerous concessions negotiated by Rhodes' British South Africa Company, BSAC. He fell out with Rhodes when the latter provoked Lobengula into the First Matabele War so he could take that country. In 1893 Moffat exposed the trickery behind the BSAC Bosman Concession in Ngamiland, which was abandoned as a result. In 1894 when the BSAC police clashed with warriors of the Bamangwato king Khama III in Bechuanaland, he warned that Rhodes' next victim was Khama, a British ally. But Moffat's boss, Shippard, was Rhodes's agent, and he dismissed Moffat.

Club career =Boca Juniors= Son of H√©ctor Marinelli, a former Boca Juniors player, Marinelli started off his youth career at Argentinos Juniors before being signed by Boca Juniors in a package of youth players that included names such as Juan Rom√°n Riquelme, Fabricio Coloccini and C√©sar La Paglia. Marinelli had only one reserve appearance against Independiente in August 1999 before being spotted by Middlesbrough when Boca's U-19 team played in Europe. On 27 October 1999, he joined the English side for ¬£1.5 million. =Middlesbrough= Billed as the new Maradona by the English press, Marinelli played his first match for Middlesbrough for the reserve team against Barnsley, scoring from a free-kick in a game that had an attendance of nearly 10,000 people. He made his first team debut at the 1999 Boxing Day Premier League match against Sheffield Wednesday, playing the second half in a 1-0 loss. He had a second Premier League appearance that season in a 1-1 draw against Watford. The following season, Marinelli played a total of 13 matches with only 305 minutes of action, averaging less than 25 minutes per match played. He was sent off in the 2-2 draw against Bradford City on 25 November 2000 and had dealt with ankle injuries that cost his place at the Argentina under-20 squad for the 2001 South American U-20 Championship. Under Steve McClaren, who was appointed manager for the 2001-02 season, Marinelli featured regularly for the first team after recovering from a calf injury earlier in the season and earned a regular spot in the first team after a 5-1 win against Derby County, in which he scored his first goal for the team and later his second, had one assist and contributed to another goal after having a shot rebounded to Szil√°rd N√©meth. Losing his starting place in the second half of the season, Marinelli ended the 2001-02 season with 20 appearances. After an unimpressive start in the 2002‚Äì03 season, Marinelli played just 7 league matches in the season, having scored once against Brentford in a 2002‚Äì03 Football League Cup match. After being close to return to Boca Juniors, he stalled on the move after a managerial change at the Argentinian club. Loan to Torino On 31 January 2003, he was loaned to Torino until the end of the season, playing a total of 7 Serie A matches, receiving a red card in the derby against Juventus after pushing the referee. Although Torino wanted to sign Marinelli on a permanent basis, the deal called off after both parties disagreed on the wage fee. =Return to Middlesbrough= After returning to Middlesbrough, Marinelli played in the 2003-04 season opener against Fulham, scoring once in the 3-2 loss which was his last league match for Boro. On 14 November 2003, his contract was ended by mutual consent after failing to live up to expectations. =Boca Juniors= After becoming a free agent, Marinelli stated his desire to return to Boca Juniors and signed for his boyhood club in 2004. His official debut was against V√©lez Sarsfield in a 3-3 draw, when he scored on his debut against V√©lez only to have it was officially awarded as an own goal. However, he took the blame of a goal scored by Marcelo de Souza after being beaten by the opponent and failing to chase him back. He only played other two league matches against Banfield and Racing and was overlooked by then manager Carlos Bianchi after being sent off in a reserve match. Marinelli took part in the 2004-05 preseason friendlies under Miguel √Ångel Brindisi, before leaving the club. =Racing Club= Marinelli joined Racing for the 2004-05 season and made his league debut against former club Boca Juniors. Mostly a substitute, he ended 2004 with 11 league appearances for Racing. =Return to Torino= In January 2005, after attracting interest from Torino, Marinelli paid 30,000 Euros from his own pocket to leave Racing and return to the Italian side. His debut at Serie B was against Hellas Verona and he was sent off just as his last match at the club. Scoring in a 3-1 win against Pescara, Marinelli played a total of 16 league matches and helped Torino to achieve promotion to 2005‚Äì06 Serie A, but the team was not admitted at the first tier for financial problems and his contract was ended due to the financial crisis at the club. =Sporting Braga= In September 2005, Marinelli had the opportunity to join Portuguese side S.C. Braga, but had his registration denied by Primeira Liga after the end of the transfer window. He agreed a deal in December and officially signed in January 2006. He played only 4 times for the Portuguese side and left the club after the end of the 2005-06 season. Having limited playing time at Braga due to an injury in his right foot, he returned to Argentina for treatment and trained with Boca Juniors to regain match fitness. =Kansas City Wizards= In 2007, he joined the Kansas City Wizards of Major League SoccerMLS site after the American club went to Argentina in their preseason and became interested in the player after seeing him in video. Marinelli scored his only goal for the Wizards on his debut, from the penalty spot, in a 2-1 loss against Chicago Fire. He ended the 2007 Major League Soccer season with 26 appearances and 5 assists, also playing once in the 2007 MLS Cup Playoffs. The following year, Marinelli played only 15 matches, being a starter in only 7 of them and left the club at the end of the 2008 season. =Millonarios= On 9 December 2008, Millonarios de Bogot√° signed Marinelli on a one-year contract for the 2009 Torneo Finalizaci√≥n. At the Colombian club, he played a total of 11 matches and was sent off three times and was released by Millonarios along with four other under-productive players, but claimed he left the club after not receiving his wages. In 2015, FIFA ruled the situation in favour of the player and Millionarios were obliged to pay $550,000 for the player. =Aldosivi= After being close to sign for Argentinos Juniors and a period of trial at Hurac√°n, Marinelli joined Aldosivi on 17 December 2009. He played a total of 13 matches and scored twice for the Primera B Nacional club. =Gy≈ëri= In September 2010, Marinelli returned to European football after he signed for Hungarian side Gy≈ëri in a short-term deal. He decided to end his contract after only two league matches, stating that his family failed to adapt to the country. =Universidad San Mart√≠n= On 19 January 2011, Marinelli signed with Peruvian first division team Club Deportivo Universidad de San Mart√≠n de Porres, taking part at the 2011 Copa Libertadores and scoring once. Marinelli stayed at the Peruvian club for 4 years, briefly leaving the club for a week to try to join Argentine club Alvarado which would play the Torneo Argentino A, in the third tier of the Argentinian football, although he was still contracted to Universidad San Mart√≠n. At the age of 32, Marinelli decided to retire in 2014 due to injuries. International career Marinelli played for the Argentina national under-17 football team at the 1998 Mundialito Youth Tournament, where they were champions and in the 1999 South American Under-17 Football Championship, playing three matches as Argentina finished in 4th place and failed to qualify for the 1999 FIFA U-17 World Championship.

Early years Warren Akin, Sr. was born in Elbert County, Georgia and raised on a farm. At a very early age he was inspired to become a lawyer, after viewing proceedings at an Elberton court. At age 18, with a limited amount of education, Akin set he off to seek his fortune in the Dahlonega Gold Rush. He would work in the gold fields for the next seven years, during which time he fulfilled his childhood ambition by reading law. Akins was admitted to the Cherokee Superior Court in 1836. He subsequently established a successful law practice in Cassville, Georgia while also operating a modest farm just outside the city. He became well known within the north Georgia region and was appointed colonel in the Georgia Militia, aiding in the removal of the Cherokees, a historical event which became known as the Trail of Tears. Akin later confessing sympathy with their plight. Political service Expressing an interest in politics, but without the necessary support beyond his region in north Georgia, Akin ran unsuccessfully, receiving just 39.61% of the vote, for governor against incumbent Joseph Emerson Brown in 1859. Undeterred, he continued to stay active in the political events and controversies of the day. Akin was a slaveholder, but like many Southerners with Whig party backgrounds, he opposed secession. Nonetheless, after Georgia seceded from the Union, he felt honor bound to support his state, and the new national government of which it was part. He served in the Georgia state legislature from 1861 to 1863, where he was elected Speaker of the Georgia House. He is the only Representative ever elected to the position of Speaker in his first term. One act, for which he was largely responsible, was changing the name of his county from Cass to Barrow. During the first years of the war, Akin devoted his time to the practice of law in Cassville and his duties as a State Representative in Milledgeville. In 1862, long before it was an acceptable notion, Akin proposed allowing slaves to enlist in the Confederate Army with the promise of freedom in return for service. His proposal was met with overwhelming resistance. Akin wrote a letter to his wife, in which he lamented opposition to a proposal which he believed would win the war for the Confederacy: Have you ever noticed the strange conduct of our people during this war? How people of the Confederacy could oppose a measure that could help win the war seemed to have a hypocritical twist. Akin continued, They give up their sons, husbands, brothers & friends, and often without murmuring, to the army; but let one of their negroes be taken, and what a howl you will hear. The love of money had been the greatest difficulty in our way to independence - it is now our chief obstacle.... In November 1863, after the Confederate defeat in the Chattanooga Campaign, Akin became convinced that his family would be in the path of approaching Union forces. In January 1864 he moved them initially to Oxford where Akin narrowly escaped capture by Union raiders. Akin's concerns were well founded, in May 1864 Union raiders burned Akin's home, law office, papers, and personal property left behind when the family moved to Oxford. In August 1864, Akin moved the family again, this time to Elberton, where they had relatives, and where many from the Cassville area had fled. =Confederate Congress= Akin represented Georgia in the Second Confederate Congress from 1864 to 1865, where he was regarded as an administration man because of his high regard for Jefferson Davis. The loss of his home, and personal property, along with the high cost of living in Elberton, and the Confederate capital of Richmond compelled Akin to extreme economies. His letters indicate that he wore clothes until they were so soiled that he was embarrassed to continue to wear them. It was also during this period that Akin occasionally expressed frustration with the protracted nature of the process and the long-winded speeches of his colleagues. On January 30, 1865 he wrote a letter to his wife in which he lamented I... feel we are doing nothing as we ought. Congress seems not to realize the magnitude of the duties devolved upon it. Akin left the Confederate Congress one month prior to adjournment, most likely because he anticipated that the Confederacy's collapse was imminent, and that further participation in the Congress was futile. Death and legacy Considered by the Cartersville Bar ‚Äúas the first man in his profession in North Georgia‚Äù, Akin died December 17, 1877. Continued by his descendants, Akin‚Äôs law practice in Cartersville is today one of the oldest law practices in the state.

A version was adopted in 1849 following the invention of the Mini√© ball in 1847 by the French Army captain Claude-√âtienne Mini√© of the Chasseurs d'Orl√©ans and Henri-Gustave Delvigne. The bullet was designed to allow rapid muzzle loading of rifles, and was an innovation that brought about the widespread use of the rifle as the main battlefield weapon for individual soldiers. The French adopted it following difficulties encountered by the French army in Northern Africa, where their muskets were outranged by long-barreled weapons which were handcrafted by their Algerian opponents. The Mini√© rifle belonged to the category of rifled muskets. Mechanism Various types of Mini√© balls Training with the Mini√© rifle during the American Civil War, 1863. The caption reads: \\"Teaching the negro recruits the use of the Mini√© rifle\\". French soldier stands with M1842T Mini√© rifle. 1855 Mini√© ball design from Harpers Ferry, West Virginia In the Mini√© rifle a countersunk ramrod was necessary to force the ball without damaging its shape. The Mini√© rifle caused huge wounds with its large sized bullets. The rifle used a conical-cylindrical soft lead bullet, slightly smaller than the barrel bore, with three exterior grease- filled grooves and a conical hollow in its base. When fired, the expanding gas forcibly pushed on the base of the bullet, deforming it to engage the rifling. This provided spin for accuracy, a better seal for consistent velocity and longer range, and cleaning of barrel detritus. Before this innovation, the smoothbore musket commonly using the buck and ball was the only practical field weapon. Rifled muskets had been in use since the Renaissance, but they required hammering projectiles with a ramrod and mallet into the bore of the barrel, and also created considerable cleaning problems. The short-lived \\"carabine √† tige\\" system used a pin at the bottom of the barrel which deformed the bullet against the wall of the barrel when the bullet was pushed to the bottom. This system was very problematic for cleaning, especially with the black powders of the period. The Mini√© rifle used a percussion lock and weighed 10 lb 9 oz (4.8 kg). Having a reasonable accuracy up to 600 yards (550 metres), it was equipped with sights for effective aiming. The hollow-based bullet was of .702 inch (17.8 mm) calibre, and weighed 500 grains (32.4 g). It could penetrate 4 inches (10 cm) of soft pine at 1,000 yards (918 m). A test in Vincennes in 1849 demonstrated that at 15 yards the bullet was able to penetrate two boards of poplar wood, each two-thirds of an inch thick and separated by 20 inches. Soldiers of the time spread rumors that at 1,200 yards the bullet could penetrate a soldier and his knapsack and still kill anyone standing behind him, even killing every person in a line of 15. The Mini√© rifle saw limited distribution in the Crimean War and similar rifles using Mini√© bullets (such as the Pattern 1853 Enfield, the Springfield Model 1861 and the Lorenz rifle) were the dominant infantry weapons in the American Civil War. The large-caliber, easily deformed conical lead bullets, ranging in diameter from .54 to .58 inches (14-18mm), combined with the high-speed spin from the rifling, created terrible wounds. Use The Pattern 1851 Mini√© rifle was in use by the British Army from 1851 to 1855. The Mini√© system was also used extensively by various manufacturers, such as Springfield (the Springfield Model 1861) and Enfield (the Pattern 1853 Enfield). Mini√© rifles were also used extensively in the Boshin War (1868‚Äì1869) in Japan, where they had an important role in tipping the balance against the Tokugawa forces in encounters such as the Battle of Toba‚ÄìFushimi. Obsolescence The muzzle- loading Mini√© rifle became obsolete in 1866 following the defeat of the Austrians, equipped with this type of rifle, against the Prussians, who had the innovative bolt-action Dreyse rifles. In France, the existing Mini√© rifles were then retooled to accommodate a breech-loading mechanism reminiscent of a snuff box, and became known as Tabati√®re (snuff-box) rifles. Soon after, the breech-loading Chassepot system was adopted by the French army.

It connects Adelaide's gas supply to sources from Victoria's Otway Basin, thus increasing the security of natural gas supply to Adelaide. The pipeline is owned and operated by South East Australia Gas Pty Ltd who are owned in a 50-50 partnership by APA Group (Australia) and the Retail Employees Superannuation Trust. Route and branches The main pipeline is from the Minerva gas processing plant at Port Campbell in Victoria to the Pelican Point Power Station in northwestern Adelaide. There are two compressors on the route. The Miakite compressor at Grassdale in Victoria, and the Coomandook compressor in South Australia are connected by two pipes. The rest of the pipeline is a single pipe. This central section has offtakes at Poolaijelo and Naracoorte. There are also offtakes to Jervois and the Cavan Meter Station. The pipeline now supplies not just the Pelican Point power station on Le Fevre Peninsula, but also both Torrens Island Power Station and Quarantine Power Station on Torrens Island east of the peninsula. At the supply end of the pipeline, there is an lateral that connects Lochard Energy's Iona Gas Plant and Beach Energy's Otway Gas Plant to the main pipeline and a bidirectional connection between the Minerva Gas Plant and the Victorian gas transmission network. The offtake at Poolaijelo is the South East South Australia pipeline owned by APA. It supplies Epic Energy's South East Pipeline System at the Katnook processing plant southwest of Penola. The SEAGas gas replaces gas from the depleted Katnook Gas Field. It supplies Mount Gambier and Snuggery near Millicent as well as towns along the way and the Ladbroke Grove Power Station. History and construction The requirement for an upgrade to South Australia's natural gas infrastructure was first identified in June 2000 when the capacity of the MAPS (Moomba Adelaide Pipeline System) was close to being fully utilised. At this time, the MAP was the sole source of natural gas for Adelaide. As about two thirds of electricity consumed in South Australia was produced by gas- fired power stations, it was determined that the state needed an additional source of supply of natural gas. An additional factor was the redundancy provided by having two independent supplies. The need for this redundancy was dramatically confirmed when a fire at Moomba cut most of Adelaide's gas supply on the day SEA Gas began operation. The new pipeline supplied nearly all of Adelaide's gas needs at times while the damage was repaired. The pipeline was operated by a joint venture formed in May 2001 by Pelican Point Power (a subsidiary of International Power and operator of the Pelican Point Power Station) and Origin Energy (a major Australian energy producer and retailer). In September 2003, TRUenergy (then owner and operator of the Torrens Island Power Station) joined as an equal one-third partner. The initial proposal was to build a 14\\" diameter high-pressure gas pipeline, operating at 15 MPa. This was modified to dual 14\\" pipes for 338 km of the route and an 18\\" pipe for the remainder when TRUenergy joined SEA Gas as to accommodate the additional capacity required by the Torrens Island Power Station. Construction commenced in October 2002, 180 km south east of Adelaide near Tintinara. Operations commenced on 1 January 2004, however the project was not officially opened until 15 March 2004. Construction was carried out on an engineer-procure- construct (EPC) basis by a joint venture between Australian pipeline company AJ Lucas Group and French company Spie Capag.

Beasley Park is bounded by Cannon Street (north), Mary Street (west), Wilson Street (south) and Ferguson Avenue (east). History Beasley Park was originally developed in 1976. Prior to this, Beasley Park was the site of some of Hamilton's early industries, including the Grand Trunk Railway yards. In 1991, the re- development of the park was deemed a priority for revitalization of the Beasley neighbourhood. Improvements included the installation of an accessible creative play structure, a decorative fountain, concrete walkway, a community centre and a skateboarding area.

Liszt conducted the premiere himself in Weimar on 29 December 1857.Hunnenschlacht (Symphonic Poem No.11), S.105: Study score, published by Petrucci Library Press. The painting depicts the battle of the Catalaunian Fields around 20 June 451 AD, where the Hun armies led by Attila fought a savage battle against a Roman coalition led by Roman General Flavius A√´tius and the Visigothic king Theodoric. According to legend, the battle was so ferocious that the souls of the dead warriors continued their fighting in the sky as they rose to Heaven. The first section of the piece, marked ' carries Liszt's instruction: \\"Conductors: the entire colour should be kept very dark, and all instruments must sound like ghosts.\\"Walker, Alan, \\"Franz Liszt: The Weimar Years\\", Alfred A. Knopf, 1989 Liszt achieves much of this effect by scoring the entire string section to play with mutes, even in fortissimo passages. This section depicts an atmosphere of foreboding and suppressed rage before the battle breaks out. The second section, ', begins with a \\"\\" (battle cry) in the horns, which is then taken up by the strings. The main battle theme is then stated, a fully formed version of material from the very opening. This entire section makes use of the so-called gypsy scale, which Liszt frequently used in his Hungarian-themed compositions. In this section Liszt introduces an unusual effect: against the current of the raucous battle music in the rest of the orchestra, the trombones play the ancient plainchant melody \\"\\". Liszt's own description of this section was of \\"two opposing streams of light in which the Huns and the Cross are moving.\\" La Mara (ed.), \\"Franz Liszt's Briefe\\", vol. 1, Leipzig, 1893‚Äì1905 The \\"\\" theme is later taken up by the strings in a quiet, peaceful contrasting section.

The mass murder of 918 members of the Peoples Temple Agricultural Project, better known by its informal name \\"Jonestown\\", on November 18, 1978 have spurred numerous conspiracy theories. These include the alleged involvement of outside forces in the deaths, including the Central Intelligence Agency and the Soviet Union. These theories often include the assertion that the events that occurred in Jonestown were a result of CIA experiments in mind control or similar methods of social experimentation. The proponents of these theories often state their belief that these mind control experiments which were, according to them, responsible for the deaths at Jonestown were a covert example of Project MKUltra in practice. According to Rebecca Moore, \\"In the twenty-three years since the deaths in Jonestown, conspiracy theories have blossomed in number and sophistication.\\" CIA The day Leo Ryan was killed, his top aide Joe Holsinger, who later became head of the DNC, received a White House call detailing the exact number of people killed based on \\"a CIA report from the scene.\\"https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA- RDP90-00965R000100170035-8.pdf Discrepancies during investigation Headlines in the New York Post,New York Post, Nov 28, 1978: \\"Cult Dies in South American Jungle: 400 Die in Mass Suicide, 700 Flee into Jungle.\\" the New York Times,New York Times, Nov 21, 1978; Nov 22, 1978; Nov 23, 1978 and the San Francisco ExaminerSan Francisco Examiner, Nov 22, 1978 originally cited reports from the Guyanese army that 408 people had killed themselves while more than 500 others managed to flee into the surrounding jungle. The U.S. military arrived several days later and the body count quickly rose; first it was 700, then 780, to a final tally given seven days after the Guyanese report of 909 dead, 4 followers dead at the Temple offices in the capital of Georgetown, and 5 members of Representative Leo Ryan's delegation, including the Congressman himself, murdered at the Port Kaituma airstrip. Only 167 Jonestown inhabitants were reported to have survived. In explaining the discrepancies, one U.S. official said the Guyanese \\"couldn't count\\"New York Times, November 25, 1978 while another said that the 400 corpses initially found had just been stacked in such a way that they hid more than 500 more. The dead littered the compound, with piles of bodies decomposing atop one another near the pavilion, and corpses in other buildings or far-flung positions were not readily apparent. While the total number of settlers living in Jonestown at the time of the massacre has never been properly verified, based on the population estimates there could be anywhere between 20 and 120 followers not accounted for. Conspiracy theorists and at least one Congressional aide claimed these people formed the so-called \\"Red Brigade\\", which was armed guards (or perhaps brainwashed assassins) who carried out the attack at the airport as well as providing more typical duties maintaining security along the roads and around the compound. According to the New York Times,New York Times, December 14, 1978 the first trained medical official on the scene was the Guyanese coroner Dr. Leslie C. Mootoo. He and his assistants examined over 100 of the bodies during a 32-hour period and found that the adults had all been injected with cyanide in places which they could not have reached without assistance, such as between the shoulder blades, and that many of them had also been shot. (Charles Huff, one of the first U.S. soldiers on the scene, also reported having seen \\"many gunshot victims\\", as well as other victims who had been shot with a crossbow, all of whom appeared to have been attempting to flee.) Mootoo also felt that the children were incapable of consenting to suicide. Based on his preliminary findings, Mootoo speculated that the majority of those who died in Jonestown may have been murdered. Despite Guyana law requiring an autopsy for any unnatural death, the Americans insisted that the cause of death was readily apparent and additional inquiry was not necessary. Relatives and officials back in the United States complained about being kept from the remains, and according to the New York Times,New York Times, December 12, 1978 Dr. Sturmer, then President of the National Association of Medical Examiners, sent an open letter to the U.S. Army complaining about the handling of remains and the illegal cremations of most of the Jonestown victims. For a number of reasons, some legal and some merely logistical, the bodies were not flown out of the remote jungle location of Jonestown for up to a week before being flown to New Jersey, which allowed significant decomposition to occur. Ultimately seven autopsies were conducted but the medical examiners were not informed of Dr. Mootoo's preliminary findings and the corpses were far too decayed for injection sites or other wounds to remain identifiable during the procedures.New York Times November 26, 1978 Richard Dwyer Despite the growing allegations of misconduct against the Peoples Temple in the U.S., the move to Jonestown was given the full support of the American Embassy in Guyana. Some claim their cooperation was facilitated by Larry Layton's brother-in-law, as well as people including Walter Mondale, Rosalynn Carter, and George Moscone. Others point out that the Georgetown CIA station was in office space within the U.S. Embassy building itself, and at least three diplomatic officials there were allegedly CIA assets. Richard Dwyer, whose name was listed in Who's Who in the CIA, was Deputy Chief of Mission of the U.S. Embassy to Guyana at the time. There exists a strong likelihood that Ryan would not have been at the airstrip during the attack without direct intervention by Dwyer. Ryan had intended to remain at the Jonestown compound to continue interviewing families while those wishing to return to the United States were taken to the airstrip, but as the dump truck was leaving Ryan was attacked by Peoples Temple follower and alleged Red Brigade member Don Sly (also known as Ujara). Ujara wielded only a knife and the attack was quickly ended. Ryan was cut in the attack and decided to board the dump truck headed to the airstrip. Already on the dump truck was Larry Layton, who, despite warnings by the defectors that Layton was a strong supporter of Jim Jones, had been allowed to join the group at the last minute. Layton participated in the attacks on the Ryan delegation, ultimately serving nearly twenty years in prison after being disarmed and failing to kill his targets on the Cessna, becoming the only Peoples Temple follower to face criminal charges for these events. On September 27, 1980, a column by investigative reporter Jack Anderson was published under the title \\"CIA Involved In Jonestown Massacre.\\"Anderson, Jack, \\"CIA Involved In Jonestown Massacre, September 27, 1980 According to Anderson, Dwyer and Jones had ties to the CIA, with Dwyer's ties dating to at least 1959; when quizzed directly about this alleged CIA involvement, Dwyer responded \\"no comment.\\" At one point on the sound-recording made during the mass suicide, Jones' own voice commands, \\"Take Dwyer on down to the east house\\" and a short time later, Jones says \\"Get Dwyer out of here before something happens to him.\\" However, rather than being in Jonestown, numerous witnesses, including reporters for the Washington Post and San Francisco Chronicle, saw Dwyer miles away at the Port Kaituma airstrip.Tim Reiterman (1982) \\"Raven: The Untold Story of The Rev. Jim Jones and His People\\" page 527 Dwyer arrived there with some local constables just before the ambush by the Jonestown \\"Red Brigade\\" security squad. Dwyer was also shot in the buttocks during the Red Brigade's ambush at that location.Tim Reiterman (1982) \\"Raven: The Untold Story of The Rev.

Views from the Soviet Union The Jonestown Carnage: A CIA Crime (1978) (Russian: –ì–∏–±–µ–ª—å –î–∂–æ–Ω—Å—Ç–∞—É–Ω–∞ - –ø—Ä–µ—Å—Ç—É–ø–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ –¶–†–£) by S.F. Alinin, B.G. Antonov and A.N. Itskov was published in 1987 in the Soviet Union, relying upon both unfounded allegations and some relatively indisputable facts. The book cites many characteristics of the Peoples Temple which may have made it unpopular with the U.S. Government. For example, citing the numerous tapes and writings of the Temple, the book notes that the Peoples Temple practiced apostolic socialism, preached atheism, and opposed what it termed to be capitalist imperialism by the U.S. Government. The book also cites the numerous meetings that representatives of the Peoples' Temple had with Soviet embassy officials to negotiate a potential exodus to the Soviet Union. The book also references the October 2, 1978 visit to Jonestown by Soviet Embassy representative Feodor Timofeyev, who praised the commune for being a socialist haven, wagging its collective finger in the face of the U.S. government. In addition to documented events, the book also includes contentious allegations not revealed in the Jonestown tapes or other available evidence. One such item describes a statement by Timofeyev of a purported meeting on November 18, 1978, with Deborah Touchette, whom Timofeyev claimed passed him a briefcase with cash and Peoples Temple documents inside. Another report in the book concerned a call from Sharon Amos, staying at the Peoples Temple office in Georgetown with her three children on the day of the massacre, where Amos allegedly described a radio message from out of Jonestown about military helicopters and armed men approaching the compound. Amos and her three children died upon Jones' order. Based upon these and other allegations, the author contends that the group members were assassinated by CIA agents and mercenaries to prevent further political emigration from the U.S. as well as suppress opposition to the U.S. regime.

Under a majority of taxation systems around the world, and until recently under the United States tax system, firms are taxed on their profits and individuals are taxed on their personal income. For example, a firm that earns $100 in profits in the United States would have to pay around $30 in taxes. If it then distributes these profits to its owners as dividends, then the owners in turn pay taxes on this income, say $20 on the $70 of dividends. The $100 of profits turned into $50 of investor income. If, instead the firm finances with debt, then, assuming the firm owes $100 of interest to investors, its profits are now 0. Investors now pay taxes on their interest income, say $30. This implies for $100 of profits before taxes, investors got $70.Graham, John, \\"How big are the Tax Benefits of Debt\\" The Journal of Finance, 2000.

His family has used his story to raise awareness of childhood cancer and to raise almost $4 million for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee. Bowen's life Ben Bowen was born to Tom and Jennifer Bowen on November 14, 2002. Ben had a normal infancy until age 16 months, when he was diagnosed with a golf- ball‚Äìsized tumor in the middle of his brain. Ben Bowen went to Cincinnati Children's Hospital for emergency brain surgery. The tumor proved to be a very aggressive, rare, and fast-growing atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor (AT/RT). The Bowens transferred to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in March 2004. Ben's initial treatments included four brain surgeries, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. During this treatment period, Ben Bowen picked up the nickname \\"Big Ben\\" because of his \\"big\\" demeanor, bravery and smile. The tumor reoccurred by November 2004, and no known medicines or treatments were left to help him. With assistance from Federal Express, and the family of a victim in the September 11 attacks (whom Tom assisted in the recovery of), the Bowen family took Ben Bowen on a special two-week trip to Disney World, where they celebrated his second birthday. Fundraising The Bowens wanted to create a legacy in their son's name and thank Saint Jude Hospital for caring for Bowen and providing family housing. The Bowens started a fund raising program selling \\"Big Ben\\" awareness bracelets for Valentine's Day. The wristband project ended up raising over US$120,000 The 2007 fundraising drive was a raffle for a house (called The House that Ben Built) located in Putnam County, West Virginia, which brought in $808,000. Governor Joe Manchin changed WV state law to make this raffle possible. As a result, St. Jude launched a WV field office that organizes all state fundraising for the hospital. In 2008 the Bowen family organized a second St. Jude Dream Home Giveaway raffle in Hurricane, WVA and raised over $1,000,000. The third annual WV St. Jude Dream Home was scheduled to expand to two locations, Milton and Morgantown, WV, in 2009. Death Ben Bowen's last months were physically painful. Morphine did not manage his pain adequately, his body tripled in size, and he would regurgitate fecal matter. The neuropathic pain became so severe, his parents could not hold him. The Bowen family are Protestant Christians and relied on their belief that God has a plan for each life and that faith requires believing God's good promises. Ben died on February 25, 2005. Funeral Services were held on Tuesday, March 1, 2005, at River Cities Community Church in Huntington, West Virginia. The funeral cortege traveled on the highway that now bears Ben's name on the way to the cemetery. Survivors include his parents, an older brother Eli, two brothers and two sisters born after his death. Ben's family moved to the Memphis, Tennessee area, and Tom Bowen first went to work for St. Jude Children's Hospital raising funds to cure pediatric cancer, later working on creating the Childhood Cancer Network as Ben Bowen's legacy.

He was a devout Swedenborgian who was famous for both vision and enterprise. He was born in Newmilns (New Mills), Ayrshire and spent most of his youth immersed in books. Extremely shy in temperament, he was known to hide whenever visitors approached. It was a habit he was to retain throughout his life. Emigration to Australia After learning bookkeeping and working as a clerk in Newmilns and Glasgow, he emigrated to Australia, where he worked as a shepherd on a remote outback station west of Brisbane. He was known to carry a large swag of books and stuffed his saddle-bags with philosophy, theology, engineering and science books. He frugally saved his pennies and entered into business with Brisbane storekeeper, Robert Love. A lot of custom started coming from the tin-fields of Stanthorpe. Moffat started a branch of the business on the tin fields where he traded goods for tin and used his intelligence and savings to invest in the best prospects on the field. Tin smelter Moffat invested the profits of his educated speculations on building a smelter, so the ore could be processed on the field and profits retained. A prosperous community grew around these achievements. In 1879, Moffat sent two of his agents, William Jack and John Newell to survey the wild frontier of north Queensland on the Atherton Tablelands, west of Port Douglas. The Tinaroo field The area was known to have abundant resources of tin on what became known as the Tinaroo field, site of today's Lake Tinaroo. While prospecting there, Jack and Newell met John Atherton, an early settler knew that the first European explorer in that region, James Venture Mulligan had noticed rich deposits of tin ore on the Wild River, higher up in the 'wild ranges' in 1875. Atherton led Jack and Newell on an exploratory expedition to the area in 1879 but the party failed to find the rich alluvial deposits that had been noted by Mulligan. In 1880, a second expedition located the deposit and secured a claim for Moffat and Company. The town of Herberton was officially laid out in August of that year. Great Northern mining company Upon receiving samples of the ore and assaying them himself, John Moffat immediately departed for Herberton. Realizing the value of the lode and the abundant resources he was surrounded by, he instigated the Great Northern Mining company, arranged to have a mill and smelter built and embarked on a fact-finding and purchasing trip in Europe. Foundation of Irvinebank Moffat returned to the Great Northern Mine and Mill in Herberton and learned of a new find 27 km to the west. After surveying the site, he founded a settlement there which he named 'Irvinebank', after the River Irvine of his birthplace, in Scotland. He used the latest knowledge and technology he had found in England, Scotland, Belgium and Germany, along with the finance raised, to develop the field and surrounding regions. John Moffat lived in Irvinebank from 1884 to 1912 and from there helped spur the development of north-eastern Australia by building mines, mills, smelters, towns, railways, tramways, aerial cableways and other infrastructure. Philanthropy He always recognized the importance of community, especially in the harsh and remote frontier of northern Australia, and always initiated and supported cultural infrastructure such as transport, School of Arts libraries, churches and other cultural institutions. This attracted families and permanent settlers who established themselves in a harsh and inhospitable environment.  Awards  In 2018, John Moffat was inducted into the Queensland Business Leaders Hall of Fame. References *Kerr, R, John Moffat of Irvinebank, JD & RS Kerr, Brisbane, 2000 *Bolton, G.

He was a professor of physics at Harvard University and inventor in the development of electronic telecommunications. The son of a Texas cattle rancher, he distinguished himself in school at Taylor and in the University of Texas before beginning his enduring relationship with Harvard in 1898. He wrote three innovative texts, many learned papers, and was assigned 53 patents. The most notable is the single-stage crystal oscillator circuit, which became the touchstone of the electronics communication art. S√ºsskind says that he was \\"an exceedingly warm and droll individual, much revered by his students.\\" Biography =Youth= G. W. Pierce was born January 11, 1872, in Webberville, Texas. He frequently recalled in later life ‚Äúdrawing water with leaky buckets from deep wells for thirsty mules‚Äù as a prod that motivated his intensity in study. At the University of Texas he had Alexander Macfarlane as teacher and mentor: they co-authored a paperDielectric Strength from Nature 48:181 (#1260) for the first volume of the Physical Review. He taught at Dallas High School (1896-7) and worked in the clerk's office of the Bastrop County Court before winning his 1898 scholarship to Harvard. With a thesis on measurement of wavelength of shortwaves he gained the Ph.D. in 1900. After a European study-tour that included some exposure to Ludwig Boltzmann, he was invited to begin instructing at Harvard. He was instrumental in forming the Wicht Club (1903‚Äì1911), a peer-group dedicated to continuing their learning even though teaching. =Family= G. W. Pierce was the middle son of three. He shared his name with his father, but there seems to have been no use of the traditional Sr. and Jr. appendages. In 1904 he married Florence Goodwin of Saxonville, Massachusetts. Though they produced no offspring, they enjoyed some family life with Cornelia and Walter Cannon, a Harvard Medical School physiologist, who drew the Pierces to Franklin, New Hampshire. For example, Cornelia introduced George to portrait, landscape, and abstract painting. This medium became a strong method of expression for him. After Florence died in 1945, Pierce found a second companionship with Helen Russell of Sanbornton, New Hampshire. His first sign of faltering health came with a minor stroke in 1945, but he carried on until a series of major strokes killed him about a decade later. He died on August 25, 1956. Pierce apparently was not related to the award-winning electronics engineer John R. Pierce. Professor/Inventor G. W. Pierce had an eye for finding the main sticking point in physical processes. For electronics he saw that resonance was a key phenomenon. His five-part series \\"Experiments on resonance in wireless telegraph circuits in Physical Review (1904-7) are evidence of his leadership. By 1910 his first textbook Principles of Wireless Telegraphy was published. It is in this text, and others by John Ambrose Fleming, that the term modulation is first used to describe imprinting an audio wave onto a high-frequency carrier wave by variation of amplitude of the carrier.T. K. Sarkar et al. (2006) History of Wireless page 104, In 1912 he worked with A. E. Kennelly on motional impedance (see below). In 1914 he was assigned the directorship of the Cruft Physics Laboratory at Harvard. Then in 1917 he gained the rank of professor. The year 1920 saw two important developments: his second text Electric Oscillations and Electric Waves was published. And most significantly, he followed up on an innovation of Walter Guyton Cady of Wesleyan University, using quartz crystal to stabilise frequency of electrical oscillation. In early attempts, radio communication was severely handicapped by the lack of reliable fixed-frequency operation, and Pierce saw the potential for the quartz-governed circuit. Cady's circuit used multiple triode vacuum tubes, and Pierce was able to reduce this to a single tube.Benjamin Parzen (1983) Design of Crystal and Other Harmonic Oscillators, Chapter 5: The Family of Pierce, Colpitts, and Clapp Oscillators, Chapter 7: Normal Pierce Oscillator, Chapter 8: Isolated Pierce Oscillator Insights such as this one resulted in patent assignments, for which Pierce then sold license to use, yielding him the capital to purchase vacation homes in Franklin, New Hampshire, and St. Petersburg, Florida. =Motional impedance= In their laboratory, Pierce and A. E. Kennelly undertook an experiment measuring the change in impedance of telephone receivers over a range of audio frequencies when the diaphragm was clamped by finger or quill insert. At each frequency the receiver resistance and reactance were measured and impedance computed, then the difference of free versus clamped impedance plotted as a complex number, or point in the impedance plane. For every receiver, the range of frequencies yields a series of con-cyclic points. The phenomenon was called \\"motional impedance\\" and the circle a \\"motional impedance circle\\".G.W. Pierce & Arthur E. Kennelly (1912) \\"Motional Impedance\\", Proceedings of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences 48:113-51 This example of circular phenomena in device-impedance became so familiar, eventually, that the Smith Chart was introduced to provide a bounded universe (or chart) for such circles. =Later years= In 1921 he was made Rumford Professor of Physics; in 1929 he was awarded the Medal of Honor of the Institute of Radio Engineers (I.R.E.). He continued to file patents, and he reported on crystal oscillators in the Proceedings of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1923 and 1925. He retired in 1940, publishing his text Song of Insects in 1943. It made an analysis of the cricket \\"songs\\". In the same year the Franklin Institute awarded him its Franklin Medal.Franklin Medal for George Washington Pierce from Franklin Institute For a list of publications and patents see Saunders and Hunt (1959).

Early life Emeril John Lagasse III was born on October 15, 1959, in Fall River, Massachusetts, to a French-Canadian father, Emeril John Lagass√©, Jr. and Portuguese mother, Hilda Medeiros. Lagasse worked in a Portuguese bakery as a teenager where he discovered his talent for cooking and subsequently enrolled in a culinary arts program at Diman Regional Vocational Technical High School. His talents as a percussionist earned him a scholarship to the New England Conservatory of Music, but he chose instead to attend Johnson & Wales University in hopes of becoming a chef. He attended Johnson & Wales in 1978. Many years later, the school awarded him an honorary doctorate. Career Lagasse graduated from the culinary school JWU in 1978 and became Executive Chef at the Dunfey's Hyannis Resort in 1979. He was nominated as Chef of the Year in 1983. In 1982 Lagasse succeeded Paul Prudhomme as executive chef of Commander's Palace in New Orleans under Richard Brennan He led the kitchen there for seven and a half years before leaving to open his own restaurant.https://www.eater.com/2015/3/27/8297241/emeril- lagasse-new-orleans-emerils-anniversary-NOLA In 1990 he opened Emeril's in New Orleans. It was designated \\"Restaurant of the Year\\" in Esquire magazine that year, and has been a recipient of the Wine Spectator Grand Award since 1999. Many of his restaurants, as well as his corporate office, Emeril's Homebase, are located in New Orleans. In August 2006 Lagasse contributed several recipes to the meal selection aboard the International Space Station, as part of a general NASA effort to improve the quality of the food supply for astronauts. Lagasse's cuisine in particular was selected in the hopes that the spicier fare would offset the reported tendency of microgravity to deaden flavors.\\"Station Crew ‚ÄòKicks it Up a Notch‚Äô with Chef Emeril Lagasse.\\" NASA press release.

Television and film appearances =Cooking shows= Lagasse first appeared on television on the show Great Chefs where he was featured on ten episodes, including Great Chefs, the Louisiana New Garde, New Orleans Jazz Brunch and Great Chefs ‚Äî Great Cities. From 1993-1995 he was the original host of Food Network's How to Boil Water. After several appearances on several other Food Network programs, Lagasse hosted his own show, Essence of Emeril. \\"Essence\\" in the title refers to Emeril's Essence, the name of a spice blend of his own concoction that he frequently uses in his cooking, and which is commercially available in several flavors. He also often suggested that viewers of his show create their own spice blends that reflect their personal tastes and be unafraid to use them to customize the dishes he would teach. In early 1997 Emeril Live began production. Later that year, the show won a Cable Ace Award for \\"Best Informational Show\\" of 1997. Lagasse was one of sixteen chefs featured in the 1993 Julia Child series Cooking With Master Chefs. He also appeared on Shop at Home Network (which, like Food Network, was owned by Scripps Networks), on the From Emeril's Kitchen from 2005‚Äì06. The program was discontinued after Scripps liquidated Shop at Home's assets to Jewelry Television in June 2006. On television, Lagasse is known for his light and jovial hosting style as well as several catchphrases, including \\"Bam!\\". Emeril's signature catchphrase began simply as a means of keeping his studio crew awake, alert and focused. When Emeril first began at Food Network, he would tape seven shows a day, from seven in the morning until two in the afternoon. The interjection soon proved a hit with viewers. \\"Kick it up a notch\\", \\"Aw, yeah, babe\\" and \\"Feel the love\\", are usually said before or after adding something spicy to a dish, or after the reaction to adding something. When frying or making dishes like sausage, Lagasse advocated using genuine lard, boasting, \\"Pork fat rules!\\" This style developed fully, and Lagasse became more comfortable when a live studio audience was added in the change from Essence of Emeril to Emeril Live. Lagasse hosted a daily series, Emeril Green, which aired on Discovery Channel's eco-lifestyle network Planet Green. The show focused on cooking with organic, locally grown and seasonal produce, and was filmed on location at Whole Foods Markets across the United States. From April to July 2010, Lagasse hosted the weekly variety program The Emeril Lagasse Show, which aired on Sundays on Ion Television. In September 2011 he hosted the Hallmark Channel show, Emeril's Table. It was cancelled after one season. In 2013, Lagasse began hosting the Cooking Channel show Emeril's Florida. The show aired for five seasons, from 2013 to 2017. =Culinary travel show= Emeril now hosts Eat the World with Emeril Lagasse on Amazon Video produced by Ugly Brother Studios. Its first season was released for streaming on September 9, 2016. In 2017 the show won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Culinary ProgramAmazon's ‚ÄúEat the World‚Äù among Daytime Emmy winners from Realscreen. Retrieved 2017-05-03. as well as for Single-Camera EditingAmazon & Netflix Lead Daytime Creative Arts Emmy Awards Winners- Full List, Deadline. Retrieved 2017-05-04. The television show features Emeril and internationally known chefs such as; Angela Dimayuga, Danny Bowien, Mario Batali, Aar√≥n S√°nchez, Jos√© Andr√©s and others, traveling the world and trying local favorites. =Cooking competition shows= In 2009 Lagasse joined Bravo's Top Chef as a judge. He also was a guest judge during season 9 of Top Chef: Texas in 2011 and joined the judges' table for seasons 10 and 11 in Seattle and New Orleans, respectively. During season 11 of Top Chef: New Orleans, Emeril's Restaurant was the featured location and the episode's winning dish was featured on the menu at the restaurant. Lagasse teamed with fellow Food Network personality Mario Batali in a tag battle against Bobby Flay and White House executive chef Cristeta Comerford on an episode of Iron Chef America which aired on January 2, 2010. Lagasse served as the \\"Menu Master\\" of the TNT cooking competition show On the Menu, which ran for one season in 2014. The show was hosted by Ty Pennington. =Acting= In 1996, Lagasse was a guest on the animated show Space Ghost Coast to Coast, where he and other chefs, including Martin Yan, prepare meals for Space Ghost. Lagasse briefly starred on Emeril, a TV sitcom on NBC during the 2001 fall season with Robert Urich, in which he played a fictionalized version of himself. It was canceled after eleven episodes. He provides the voice of hot-tempered alligator named Marlon the Gator in the 2009 New Orleans-set Disney film The Princess and the Frog. In 2006, Lagasse appears as himself in the film Last Holiday, starring Queen Latifah. He is featured as the cooking inspiration to her character and appears in the final scene. In 2012, Lagasse appeared as himself on an episode of the HBO drama series Treme. Lagasse's scene was written by fellow chef (and Treme writer) Anthony Bourdain, who stated afterward that writing the scene was \\"a dream\\" for him because it showed a sadder, more burdened side of Lagasse, which existed in real life but was rarely shown in his television appearances. =Other= In 1998 he became a food correspondent for ABC's Good Morning America, which he continues today. Lagasse acted as Grand Marshal of the 2008 Tournament of Roses Parade and presided over the nationally telecast coin-toss before the game wearing a business suit‚Äîa rarity for Lagasse who is normally attired in chef's garb. He made a guest appearance on Jon & Kate Plus 8 during the show's 5th season to help celebrate its 100th episode in May 2009. Lagasse has appeared on the Home Shopping Network and QVC. Philanthropy and activism The Emeril Lagasse Foundation, founded in 2002, supports non-profit organizations and educational initiatives that create opportunities for children, especially for those from disadvantaged circumstances, to realize their full potential. Emeril Lagasse Foundation has distributed more than $6 million in grants for children's charities. Projects funded by the Foundation include an outdoor classroom, gardens, fresh foods cafeteria and teaching kitchen at Edible Schoolyard New Orleans and the Orlando Junior Academy's Edible Schoolyard as well as a new culinary kitchen house, an accessible learning kitchen for special needs students at St. Michael Special School, a four-year culinary arts program for high school students at New Orleans Center for the Creative Arts, the Emeril Lagasse Foundation Hospitality Center at Caf√© Reconcile, and hospitality training at Liberty's Kitchen for at-risk youth preparing healthy school meals. Each fall, the foundation hosts its signature annual fundraiser, Carnivale du Vin, which ranks among the Top Ten U.S. Charity Wine Auctions in Wine Spectator magazine. The Foundation introduced the charity indoor/outdoor food and music fest Boudin, Bourbon & Beer in 2011. In 2013 Lagasse was honored as James Beard Foundation Humanitarian of the Year. In 2010 Lagasse appeared in a commercial to raise awareness of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Also starring in the commercial were Sandra Bullock, Peyton and Eli Manning, Jack Del Rio, Drew Brees, James Carville, Blake Lively, and John Goodman. Cuisine Lagasse's style of cooking is called \\"New New Orleans\\", which uses local Louisiana ingredients in his own interpretation of Creole cuisine, strongly influenced by Asian, Portuguese, Southwestern, and other cultures which themselves influence New Orleans cuisine.About Emeril Lagasse However, the styles of cuisine at Lagasse's restaurants are not all the same. Delmonico Steakhouse at The Venetian in Las Vegas is a classic steakhouse with a Creole flair, and Emeril's Coastal Italian serves seafood-heavy, Italian-inspired fare. Merchandising and endorsements Lagasse has a wide range of branded products. On June 8, 2000, he signed a deal with B&G; Foods to create a line of dry grocery products marketed under the label \\"Emeril's.\\" The product line includes pasta sauces, marinades, salsas, and Lagasse's signature \\"Essence\\" spice blend. In 2004 he lent his name to a line of fresh produce made by Pride of San Juan. These products, branded \\"Emeril's Gourmet Produce\\", include spring mix salad blends, fresh herbs, and heirloom tomatoes. Lagasse also has two lines of kitchen knives produced by W√ºsthof and cookware made by All-Clad, as well as a line of kitchen electrical appliances made by T-Fal. On February 19, 2008, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia announced it had acquired the rights to all Emeril products including cookware, cookbooks, television shows, and food products in a $50 million agreement. Lagasse retains rights to his restaurants and corporate offices. Personal life Lagasse met his first wife, Elizabeth Kief, while working at the Venus De Milo Restaurant in Swansea, Massachusetts to pay his way through school. After Kief and Lagasse divorced, Lagasse married a second time to a fashion designer, Tari Hohn, but that too ended in divorce. Lagasse was married a third time on May 13, 2000, to a real estate broker, Alden Lovelace. He and Lovelace had two children. In 2011, Lagasse and his family moved to Destin, Florida. His mother, Hilda Medeiros Lagasse died on August 24, 2016.

The game featured two American Conference teams, the #2 Iowa Barnstormers (11-3) against the #1 Arizona Rattlers (12-2). Iowa was coming from losing ArenaBowl X to the Tampa Bay Storm and were still looking for their first championship title, while Arizona was making its second appearance after winning ArenaBowl VIII against the Orlando Predators three seasons ago. Now, they were trying to acquire their second league title. Game summary In the first quarter, the Rattlers slithered first with Kicker Anthony Brenner getting a 19-yard Field Goal, yet the Barnstormers responded with Quarterback Kurt Warner completing a 30-yard touchdown pass to OS Lamont Cooper. In the second quarter, Arizona lead off the period with FB/LB Bob McMillen getting a one-yard touchdown run, while Iowa kicker Mike Black nailed a 25-yard field goal. The Rattlers would begin to take command with QB Donnie Davis (who was filling in for an injured Sherdrick Bonner) completing a 4-yard touchdown pass to WR/LB Hunkie Cooper, while the Barnstormers' only response was Black kicking a 20-yard field goal. Immediately afterwards, the Rattlers continued striking as Hunkie Cooper would return the kickoff 56 yards for a touchdown to end the half. In the third quarter, Arizona continued its domination as Davis got a one-yard Quarterback sneak run for a touchdown, while Hunkie Cooper returned an interception 30 yards for a touchdown. Iowa's only response from the period was Warner completing another 30-yard touchdown pass to Lamont Cooper. Afterwards, the Rattlers wrapped up the period with Davis completing a 49-yard touchdown pass to WR/LB Calvin Schexnayder. In the fourth quarter, the Barnstormers tried to fight back with WR/DB Willis Jacox getting a one-yard touchdown run, yet Arizona wrapped the game up with Davis and Schexnayder hooking up with each other again on a 28-yard touchdown pass, while Brenner would put on the finishing touches with a 44-yard field goal. All that was left of Iowa's attack was Warner completing a nine-yard touchdown pass to WR/LB Leonard Conley. With the win, the Rattlers got their second Arena Bowl title in franchise history.

He is known as one of the most successful walk-ons in the history of American collegiate running, due to his athletic successes while at Villanova. Running career =High school= Buerkle graduated from Aquinas Institute high school in 1965 with personal best times of 4:28 for the mile and 10:01 for two miles. He began running competitively only in his senior year of high school. =Collegiate= With no stand-out track credentials from high school, Buerkle enrolled at Villanova initially with no sports scholarship. At Villanova, he learned under the tutelage of head coach Jumbo Elliott and assistant coach Jim Tuppeny. He finally received a track scholarship in April of his junior year, after breaking the nine-minute barrier in the two-mile race, recording 8:57 at a dual meet in Knoxville. Two weeks later, Buerkle lowered Villanova's two-mile record to 8:46.2. He graduated from Villanova in 1970 with a degree in Spanish studies. =Post-collegiate= After graduating from Villanova, Buerkle never ran as a professional. He began working for a distributor of contact lenses in Buffalo, New York, although Buerkle said that the company welcomed his running goals. Buerkle qualified for the 1976 and 1980 Olympics. The 1976 Games in Montreal were a disappointment for Buerkle; in the 5000 meters, he was ninth in what was, at that point, the fastest 5000 m heat in history and did not qualify for the final. The U.S. team did not compete in 1980 because of the boycott enacted by President Jimmy Carter. On January 13, 1978, at the CYO Invitational held at the Cole Field House, he broke the indoor mile world record with a time of 3:54.93, finishing ahead of Filbert Bayi and Paul Cummings. He allegedly ate nine oreos and two peanut butter jelly sandwiches only a few hours before the race. He then won the men's Wanamaker Mile at the Millrose Games in 3:58.4, beating Wilson Waigwa and Bayi for a second consecutive race on Madison Square Garden's track. The Wanamaker victory put his image on the covers of Sports Illustrated and Track & Field News. Personal life Years before the look became popular, Buerkle‚Äôs most noticeable physical characteristic was his bald head which was the result of alopecia areata by age 12. The taunts he heard at track meets helped fuel his determination to succeed. He was later most thankful to Michael Jordan for shaving his head and ushering the style into the mainstream. At the time of Steve Prefontaine's death in 1975, Buerkle was his chief American rival; he composed a tribute poem that was printed in the Eugene's Register-Guard the following day. Buerkle eventually grew tired of the winter weather in his native Rochester, New York, and relocated his family to Atlanta, Georgia, soon thereafter. Buerkle continued to live and work in the Atlanta area after retiring from world-class competition in 1981. Buerkle said that the decision was not difficult. By that point, he and his wife, Jean, whom he met at Villanova, had a son, Gabriel, and two daughters, Lily and Tera. Buerkle tried careers in sales and teaching in tandem with his running career. In 1992, he began teaching Spanish at Dunwoody High School, where he also coached track and field and cross-country running. He finished his career at Henderson Middle School as a Spanish instructor while simultaneously training the boy's track team thus resulting in back to back county championships in 2011‚Äì2012. Buerkle retired in January 2014. He died on June 22, 2020 from multiple system atrophy.

It was found among the texts in what is known as the Nag Hammadi library, in Codex II and Codex XIII, immediately following the Reality of the Rulers. There are many parallels between the two texts.The Gnostic Bible, ch 27, p431, New Seeds, 2003, The manuscript does not have a title, but scholars have dubbed it ‚ÄúOn the Origin of the World,‚Äù because of what it describes. It is estimated to have been written sometime near the end of the third century. While the author is not mentioned, he or she seems to have been interested in expressing a Gnostic understanding of the world's conception. In particular, it rethinks the entire story of Genesis, and positions Yaldabaoth (the Demiurge) as the creator of the world, fulfilling the role of God in Genesis. Furthermore, the Serpent in the Garden of Eden is depicted as a hero sent by Sophia, the figure of wisdom, to guide mankind towards enlightenment. It expresses one approach to the creation and end of the world. Other myths found within the Nag Hammadi collection have varying explanations and details. This one has a distinct perspective: it intertwines views from Judaism, Christianity, Hellenistic and Egyptian thought, and others in order to help explain its concept of Gnosticism.

Madero and initially led by General Jos√© Gonz√°lez Salas following Madero's call to arms at the outbreak of the Mexican Revolution in 1910. Gonz√°lez Salas served in Francisco I. Madero's cabinet as Minister of War, but at the outbreak of the 1912 rebellion by Pascual Orozco, Gonz√°lez Salas organized 6,000 troops of the Federal Army at Torre√≥n.Alan Knight, Mexican Revolution, vol. 1: Porfirians, Liberals and Peasants. Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press 1986, p. 321. Orozquista forces surprised Gonz√°lez Salas at the First Battle of Rellano. They sent an explosives packed train hurtling toward the Federales, killing at least 60 and injuring Gonz√°lez Salas. Mutinous troops killed one of his commanders and after seeing the officer's body, Gonz√°lez Salas committed suicide.Knight, The Mexican Revolution, vol. 1, p. 322. The leadership of the division was then assigned to General Victoriano Huerta, who reorganized Gonz√°lez Salas's remaining forces that had been defeated by Oroquistas.Knight, The Mexican Revolution, vol. 1, p. 325. After Madero's overthrow in the counter-revolutionary coup that culminated the la Decena tr√°gica, Pancho Villa assumed the leadership of the revolutionary northern division. As a result, the Division became closely associated with his name. Villa himself often led his Divisi√≥n del Norte into battle. General Pancho Villa commander of the Divisi√≥n del Norte The Divisi√≥n del Norte was in effect a total army rather than a regular division. Villa's troops were assigned military ranks, outfitted with hospital trains and horse ambulances (called Servicio sanitario and said to be the first employed in Mexico), used the railroads built during the D√≠az administration to move quickly from one engagement to the other, and unlike some other revolutionary groups, were well equipped with machine guns and even an artillery unit (captured from the Mexican Federal Army and Rurales). Villa attempted to supply a horse to each infantryman, rather than only his cavalry detachments (Los dorados) in order to increase the speed of movement of his army, thus creating an early version of mobile infantry, or a late version of dragoons. Numerous foreign mercenaries served in the Falange extranjero (foreign legion) of the Divisi√≥n, including such notables as Ivor Thord-Gray and the son of Giuseppe Garibaldi. Villa excluded women soldaderas from the Divisi√≥n del Norte. U.S. American journalist John Reed spent time with Villa and the Divisi√≥n del Norte, writing in his book about the Mexican Revolution Insurgent Mexico that \\"Up to [Villa's] day, Mexican armies had always carried with them hundreds of the women and children of soldiers; Villa was the first man to think of swift forced marches of bodies of cavalry, leaving their women behind.\\"John Reed, Insurgent Mexico. New York: Appleton 1914, p. 144, excerpted in The Mexican Revolution: A Brief History with Documents, Mark Wasserman, ed. Boston: Bedford 2012, p. 51. The Divisi√≥n del Norte at its height numbered some 50,000 men. This was the largest revolutionary force ever amassed in the Americas. Pancho Villa's notoriety no doubt played an important part to recruiting such large numbers of men. Despite having such numerical advantage, the Divisi√≥n del Norte was defeated at the Battle of Celaya on April 1915 by forces of √Ålvaro Obreg√≥n. The outcome of the battle came to the favor of Obreg√≥n who used defensive tactics from current European battle reports of World War I. The Divisi√≥n del Norte with its cavalry charges was no match for well placed barbed wire, trenches, artillery and machine gun nests. Metro Divisi√≥n del Norte with stylized image of Pancho Villa In 1980, the Mexico City metro opened the Metro Divisi√≥n del Norte station on Line 3. There is a nearby Avenida Divisi√≥n del Norte. The logo for the metro station is a stylized version of Villa, but not his name.

He succeeded the pioneering work of Henri-Gustave Delvigne and Louis-√âtienne de Thouvenin. Mini√© was born and died in Paris. Mini√© served in a number of African campaigns with the Chasseurs, after which he was eventually promoted to captain. In 1846 he designed the Mini√© ball, a cylindrical bullet with a conical hollow in the base which expanded when fired. This projectile, combined with his rifle, resulted in a major improvement in firearm accuracy. The French government rewarded Mini√© with some 20,000 francs and installed him as a member of the staff at the Vincennes military school. In 1858 he retired from the French Army with the rank of colonel and later served as a military instructor for the khedive of Egypt and as a manager at the Remington Arms Company in the United States.

Beasley occupied Burlington Heights (now the site of Dundurn and Harvey Parks) in 1790 & was granted land by the Crown in 1799. A local entrepreneur, Beasley's business ventures included fur trading, land acquisition and establishment of a grill mill in Ancaster. He was a member of the legislative assembly of Upper Canada from 1791 to 1804 and was appointed colonel of the 2nd regiment of the York militia in 1809. Financial difficulties forced Beasley to sell lands at Burlington Heights, but it was purchased in 1832 by Sir Allan Napier MacNab who built Dundurn Castle on foundations of Beasley's brick home. Beasley Park in the neighbourhood is also named after him. Festivals Hamilton was also home to an annual Mustard Festival from 1998 to 2010.

It was built from August 2003 to summer 2007. A solar system with 800 kW of power is installed on the roof of the main building. The opening took place on 17 October 2007. The BMW Welt is the most visited tourist attraction in Bavaria. Operations BMW Welt operations are coordinated with the other local BMW facilities, the BMW Museum and BMW Headquarters. It has a showroom with the current model lineup of BMW cars and motorcycles, and the other two BMW Group brands, Mini and Rolls-Royce. Customers picking up special ordered cars are given a dramatic \\"staged experience\\" in which they await their new car in an enormous glass-walled hall, and their cars are lifted up from lower levels on round elevator platforms. BMW Welt also has shops selling BMW-branded promotional merchandise and accessories, and a restaurant. Design and construction BMW Welt in 2005 In 2001, an international architectural design competition was sponsored by BMW. Twenty-seven offices participated in the competitionBMW Welt Architectural Competition four of which were awarded prizes. The jury awarded two offices Sauerbruch Hutton and COOP HIMMELB(L)AU first prize and made the recommendation for the competitors to rework their design submissions in a third design phase in order for BMW to determine which office would be awarded the contract. The contract was awarded to the Vienna-based architects COOP HIMMELB(L)AU and the facility was constructed from August 2003 through summer 2007 at a cost of US$200 million. Originally conceived to be open and ready for World Cup 2006, it eventually opened on 17 October 2007, and deliveries commenced on 23 October 2007. The first customer to take European delivery of a new BMW at the Welt was Jonathan Spira. There were 2,200,000 visitors during the first 12 months of operation. The number of visitors increased to 2,930,000 in 2013, of which 60% came from Germany.

Dieric Bouts the Younger inherited his father‚Äôs shop in 1475, while Aelbrecht established his own workshop, also in Leuven. Whereas Dieric the Younger continued in his father's style, Aelbrecht developed his own unmistakable style with strong colors, rich texture and fine details. He died in Leuven.

The company began by modifying wood freight cars to add steel underframes. Later it manufactured its own line of all-steel rail cars.  Founding  Joseph S. Ralston and Anton Becker founded the Ralston Steel Car Company in 1905 by purchasing the plant of the Rarig Engineering Company on the east side of Columbus. Becker had just patented a drop-bottom gondola car which would allow the automatic unloading of coal and ballast cars (hopper cars). Prior to this invention, cars were unloaded by hand shoveling.\\"Ralston Made First Railroad Gondolas to Order.\\" Columbus Citizen. May 25, 1949. An example of a Ralston-built drop gondola can be seen here.  Expansion  With the increase in power of steam locomotives, the old wood freight cars could not take the strain, and demand for Ralston's all- steel cars exploded. By 1907, expansion of the Rarig facility began with the construction of a long Punch, Shear Fitting and Erection Shop. By 1910, a wide variety of cars were being produced.  Depression, War Surge, and Decline  During the Great Depression, orders fell off precipitously. However, the build-up to World War II in the late 1930s revived the concern, and workers were called back to work. Employment reached 700 by the summer of 1940, and was producing 25 to 30 cars per day, and as many as 40 per day was possible.\\"Ralston Steel Car Co gives employment to 700 Columbus Workers.\\" Columbus Evening Dispatch.

Originally built as a church hall in 1896, it became a theatre in 1922, with the addition of an art-deco foyer. The exterior of the building, foyer and auditorium remain to this day much as they were then. The town bought the theatre as a community space in 1961. It was Grade II listed in 1985. The early history of building and maintaining the Albert Hall was inextricably bound up with the Ithon Road Presbyterian Church, and it is a tribute to the labour of the small membership of the Church (approximately 100). History =1890s= In the 1890s, 80‚Äì90,000 visitors came to Llandrindod each year for spa treatment and rest. Many were Welsh speakers. The Presbyterian Church needed somewhere to hold Welsh language services and social events. Owen Morris Roberts drew up the plans, and church members started fund-raising. The hall was completed in 1896 at a total cost of ¬£2,000. It comprised: a large open space, moveable seating for 750 people, a small stage for choirs to assemble, and a small balcony at the back of the hall, with wooden seats. The exterior was much as it is today, except for the main doors, canopy and steps. Edward Jenkins, a member of the church, suggested its name - the Albert Hall. =1900s= In 1905, the adjoining church was rebuilt. At the same time, the Albert Hall‚Äôs basement was converted into a church schoolroom. =First World War= In 1914, the Royal Army Medical Corps (RAMC) billeted 4,000 men in Llandrindod for training. They used the Hall for events and entertainment. Llandrindod held its second annual eisteddfod in March 1915 at the Albert Hall. =Between the wars= After the war, membership of the church began to decline, and the hall was no longer needed. The committee decided that a theatre and cinema would be of value to the town. So in 1922, the Albert Hall re-opened as a theatre and cinema. A foyer, with Art Deco detailing, designed by Owen Morris Roberts & Son was added. The exterior of the building, foyer and auditorium remain to this day much as they were then. With the advent of \\"Talkies\\" ‚Äì films with sound ‚Äì in 1929, the Albert Hall discontinued its role as a cinema. The church gave the silent cinematograph unit to Bronllys sanatorium. It was at this time that the Llandrindod Wells Drama festival was launched. The week-long festival ran every year (except for the war years) until 2013. But other than that, the Albert Hall, like the town, saw a downturn in its fortunes. =Second World War= In 1939, Llandrindod again became a training base for thousands of troops. With lectures in the day, and entertainment every evening, the Albert Hall was in full use once more. Many of the troops who graced the stage would become household names. But of course, as the troops withdrew at the end of the war, so the audiences dwindled. =1950s= The church continued to hold Welsh services in the Albert Hall until 1951. Then in 1958, a local firm, Campbell & Edward,s bought it for use as an auction house. =1960s= In 1962, the townspeople of Llandrindod Wells bought the Albert Hall for ¬£2,000. A management committee composed of representatives from local organisations would run the theatre. The community raised more money, but the necessary repairs and running costs took up most of it. =1970s= With help from the Welsh Arts Council, the Committee drew up a programme of improvements. It would cost ¬£20,000, and so the fundraising started again. In 1973, the \\"Friends of the Albert Hall \\" fund was launched, and brought in over ¬£1,000 from local organisations. The Committee approached local councils and organisations, and the money was raised. The improvements included a central heating system, rewiring, repainting and decorating. Technical improvements, fire precautions and a new canopy were also added. =1980s and '90s= The local theatre company took over the management of the building. In 1981, the Albert Hall was Grade II Listed,https://britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/300009057-albert-hall-llandrindod- wells#.XDzxbPZ2vcsAlbert Hall, Llandrindod Wells - Listing Status in order for the building to be preserved and protected. Regular events included a yearly pantomime, the drama festival and Young Farmers competitions. A bar was created between the kitchen and Lesser Hall, licensed to serve alcohol to audiences. =2000s= In 2007, a ¬£115,000 restoration project began. This included a new roof. It was supported by the Heritage Lottery Fund, the European Union, and other sponsors. =2010s= It was agreed that management of the theatre should revert to a management committee. Shortly after, the Albert Hall Management Committee was re-established. The theatre was registered as a charity (Charity Number 524464http://apps.charitycommission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityWithoutPartB.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=524464&SubsidiaryNumber;=0Charity Number 524464). Since then, the theatre has undergone further improvement. The original asbestos was removed and the curtains replaced in 2016. A new heating system was installed in 2019, along with upgraded electrics. Present day The theatre is currently managed by a small committee: Albert Hall Management Committee. It consists of volunteers and members of local organisations. There are many users of the Albert Hall, including: local amateur dramatic groups, Young Farmers clubs, local performers, clubs, schools, touring productions, and shows. But the Albert Hall is a community space. Anyone can hire it for their own performance or show. Whilst it is mainly used for theatre productions, it can also accommodate: concerts, eisteddfods, film shows, ceremonies, conferences (theatre-style), and meetings. As well as the auditorium and balcony, there is a small meeting room downstairs. Known as the Lesser Hall, this room is available for small parties, rehearsals or meetings. It is also used as a dressing room space for productions with a large cast. The Albert Hall is a registered charity (Charity Number 524464http://apps.charitycommission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityWithoutPartB.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=524464&SubsidiaryNumber;=0Charity Number 524464). Its income is derived from hire fees and fund-raising. They rely on the support of the community, users and volunteers to keep the theatre open and up to date. The management committee put on regular fundraising events throughout the year. These include Talent Night in October and the Christmas Singalong in December. The committee has also put on two of its own productions of well-known musicals, The Addams Family in 2015 and Little Shop of Horrors in 2017. There is also an Albert Hall group of friends ‚Äì AHFriends. They also contribute to the fundraising efforts of the committee.

It was written by series creators Carter Bays and Craig Thomas, and directed by Pamela Fryman The pilot takes place in 2030, as a future Ted Mosby (Voiced by Bob Saget) is telling his kids the story of how he met their mother. It flashes back to 2005 to a younger Ted (Josh Radnor) who meets Robin Scherbatsky (Cobie Smulders), a reporter who he becomes smitten for. Meanwhile, Ted's lawyer friend Marshall Eriksen (Jason Segel) plans on proposing to his girlfriend Lily Aldrin (Alyson Hannigan), a kindergarten teacher. The episode introduces several of the show's storytelling tools, including the framing device of future Ted as the narrator, his children, and many flashbacks to the past, present, and future. Future Ted reveals early the ending of a possible relationship story when he tells his children that Robin is not the mother, but \\"Aunt Robin\\". When asked if he regretted revealing that Robin ultimately becomes Ted's platonic friend in the pilot episode, series creator Craig Thomas explains they stick by the decision because they didn't want the show to be about \\"will they or won't they\\" like Friends and that, despite their chemistry, it would have been criminal for Ted to decide he was ready to find someone and to have it happen so quickly. He and co-creator Carter Bays said that the show is about how \\"Ted meets the perfect woman, and it's [still] not his final love story.\\" Bays and Thomas, who had previously become writers for the Late Show with David Letterman, based the show off their time in New York City with their friends. With Ted being based on Bays and Marshall and Lily based on Thomas and his wife. The interior shots for the episode was filmed at the CBS Radford in Los Angeles, making it the only episode of the show to be filmed at the studio. The pilot received generally positive reviews from television critics. It was viewed by 10.94 million viewers.  Plot  In 2030, Ted Mosby (voiced by Bob Saget) is telling his teenaged children the story of how he met their mother. The story flashes back to 2005, where 27-year-old Ted helps his best friend Marshall Eriksen prepare to propose to his girlfriend of nine years, Lily Aldrin. At MacLaren's pub, Ted confides to his friend Barney Stinson that Marshall's engagement has made him realize that he wants to get married. Barney insists that Ted should remain single so that he can continue being his wingman. Ted then sees Robin Scherbatsky across the bar and is instantly smitten. Ted asks her out to dinner, but she says that she will be out of town for a week. Ted asks her to dinner the following night, and she accepts. Ted and Robin hit it off, and she then invites Ted to her apartment. Just as Ted is about to make his move, however, Robin is called away. Back at MacLaren's, Ted's friends tell him that he should have kissed Robin before she left. Ted, accompanied by the gang, goes to her apartment, after stopping by the restaurant where they had their first date and stealing the blue French horn that she had admired. Barney questions the legitimacy of the \\"Olive Theory\\"; he had seen Marshall eat an entire platter of olives. Marshall explains that he lied to Lily in the hopes of having a relationship with her. Barney thinks Marshall is subconsciously scared of getting married, but Marshall disagrees. Marshall tells Lily he likes olives and she is not upset. Robin and Ted resume their date. Just as they are about to kiss, however, Ted tells her that he is in love with her, destroying his chances with her. After a lingering goodbye, he returns to MacLaren's with the gang. Future Ted tells his children, \\"And that's the story of how I met... your Aunt Robin\\". Confused, the kids say that they thought that it was the story of how he met their mother and Ted simply says, \\"I'm getting to that\\".  Production  =Casting= Thomas and Bays based the characters on their friends. With Ted being based on Bays and Marshall and Lily based on Thomas and his wife. Thomas' wife Rebecca was initially reluctant to have a character based on her, but agreed if they could get Alyson Hannigan to play her. Hannigan was looking to do more comedy work, and was available. Josh Radnor and Jason Segel, who were cast as Ted and Marshall, respectively, were not well known, though Segel had been a cast member on the short-lived Freaks and Geeks and a recurring guest star on Judd Apatow follow-up Undeclared. The role of Barney was initially envisioned as a \\"John Belushi-type character\\" before Neil Patrick Harris won the role after being invited to an audition by the show's casting director Megan Branman. Pamela Fryman invited Bob Saget to be the voiceover narrator, Future Ted, explaining to him that the show would be like The Wonder Years but \\"kind of into the future\\". Saget either went to the television studio and recorded the narration while watching the episode, or did so separately and rerecorded with the episode if necessary. He normally did not attend table readings, but did so for the last episode. In various interviews Bays and Thomas have stated that \\"a pretty famous actress\\" turned down the role of Robin, whom they revealed in February 2014 to have been Jennifer Love Hewitt. They then cast Cobie Smulders, also an unknown, for the role. Bays and Thomas later said, \\"Thank God we did for a million reasons... when Ted's seeing her for the first time, America's seeing her for the first time‚Äîthe intriguingness of that propelled the show going forward and kept the show alive\\". =Filming= The interior shots for the episode were filmed at the CBS Radford in Los Angeles, making it the only episode of the show to be filmed at the studio. MacLaren's, an Irish bar in the middle of New York, in which some of the show is set, is loosely based on four favorite bars of Bays, Thomas and others from the Late Show staff. They include: McGee's, a Midtown tavern near the Ed Sullivan Theater where the Late Show is taped; McHale's, a legendary Hell's Kitchen bar which closed in 2006; Chumley's, a since-closed historic Greenwich Village pub; and Fez, another closed bar on the Upper West Side. McGee's had a mural that Bays and Thomas both liked and wanted to incorporate into the show.How I Met Your Mother 1st Season DVD Commentary The name for the bar is from Carter Bays' assistant, Carl MacLaren; the bartender in the show is also named Carl.  Reception  =Ratings= In its original American broadcast, the pilot of How I Met Your Mother was watched by 10.94 million viewers and averaged a 3.9 rating among A18-49. =Reviews= The episode received generally favorable reviews, garnering a score of 69 from Metacritic. Seth Thrasher gave the episode 5/5 saying: \\"...this is one of the funniest sitcoms I've seen in a LONG, LONG time\\". He also said that he was impressed by Harris' character: \\"I never realized Neil Patrick Harris was so damned funny. His character, Barney, is quite possibly the funniest new sitcom character to debut on television in ages\\". He also praised the rest of the cast. Brian Lowry of Variety said that it was a \\"bright\\" and \\"cleverly constructed\\" half-hour, putting it in the company of Two and a Half Men. \\"It's not often that a pilot has the polished feel of a show that's been around for a while, but How I Met Your Mother should be a solid bridge between The King of Queens and the aforementioned Two and a Half Men.\\"  References   External links  * * Category:2005 American television episodes How I Met Your Mother Category:How I Met Your Mother (season 1) episodes ","title":"Pilot (How I Met Your Mother)"},{"id":"10569870","text":"Tanvir Mahmood Ahmed (Urdu: ÿ™ŸÜŸà€åÿ± ŸÖÿ≠ŸÖŸàÿØ ÿßÿ≠ŸÖÿØ; born 1952) is a retired air officer of the Pakistan Air Force who was the Chief of the Air Staff from 2006 to 2009.

Musical training Born in the Black Sea port of Samsun, Turkey's 15th largest city and capital of Samsun Province, Yavuz √áetin spent his early school years traveling through the country's various regions, as his father, journalist Erdal √áetin, responded to the demands inherent in the profession. In 1984, at the age of 14, the adolescent music enthusiast was already taking blues and rock guitar lessons from guitarist Ahmet Kanneci and, the following year, started learning to master the acoustic guitar and, subsequently, the electric guitar. Before graduating from Istanbul's Haydarpa≈üa High School, he and classmate Ercan Saat√ßi who, in later years, became a noted musician as well as sports journalist, entered HEY magazine's music competition and their song, \\"I Will Cry\\", became the winning entry. In 1988, continuing his quest in Istanbul for higher education and advanced musical training, √áetin began studies at Marmara University's Music Department while earning an income as a musical performer in clubs such as Beyaz Ev [White House] in the port town of Bodrum, where he played in 1989‚Äì90. In 1991, upon turning 21, he formed, with young musical colleagues Batuhan Mutlugil, Kerim √áaplƒ± and Sunay √ñzg√ºr, the musical group, Blue Blues Band. Having married in 1992, Yavuz √áetin and wife Didem filed for divorce four years later. In that year, 1996, and for the remaining four years of his life, he was also a guitarist at the numerous concerts played by the noted band Mazhar- Fuat-√ñzkan. He collaborated, as well, on various albums with artists such as Teoman, Kƒ±ra√ß, Sibel T√ºz√ºn, Soner Arƒ±ca, G√∂ksel, Deniz Arcak and Acil Servis. In G√∂ksel's hit song \\"Sabƒ±r\\", he became the first Turkish guitar player to use a talk box. Of particular note is his solo on Deniz Arcak's \\"Bƒ±rakƒ±n Beni\\" from the Kƒ±pƒ±r Kƒ±pƒ±r album which, in an illustration of his mastery of the rock and blues guitar tradition, was recorded on the first take after only a couple of rehearsals. It also became the last studio session recording in which he participated. Two albums, ƒ∞lk and Satƒ±lƒ±k In 1997, Yavuz √áetin issued his first album ƒ∞lk, produced by his longtime compatriot Ercan Saat√ßi, but the album was unable to capture the spirit of that moment's public musical mood. He also earned an income from writing numerous advertising jingles, such as a well-remembered Coca-Cola spot, and his tune \\"D√ºnya\\" [\\"the World\\"], which was chosen as part of the soundtrack for the 1999 film, \\"Propaganda\\", with a score composed and arranged by master guitarist Erkan Oƒüur. Six weeks before his 31st birthday, after expending months of intense effort writing all of the tracks for his second album, Satƒ±lƒ±k, and having completed the album's final recording session, Yavuz √áetin committed suicide by leaping from Istanbul's Boƒüazi√ßi Bridge which connects Europe and Asia across the Bosphorus strait. Posthumous acclaim followed the subsequent release of the album which a number of music reviewers described as a work of genius. With the passage of years, both Satƒ±lƒ±k and the previously overlooked ƒ∞lk ve Son... have gained a near- cult status as Yavuz √áetin's music and words continue to be heard in the region keeping his legend alive for the listening public.

Her second husband was Boniface III of Tuscany. Life Richilda was the daughter of Giselbert II of Bergamo and Anselda (daughter of Arduin Glaber).Golinelli, Matilde, p. 68 Her father was a count palatine in Bergamo and imperial vicar first in Reggio nell'Emilia (1021) and then Verona. =First marriage= The name of her first husband is not known, but he was probably one of the sons or grandsons of Gandulf I, count of Verona. This unknown husband had died by 1010.In a document issued in 1010, Richilda is referred to as a widow: Jarnut, Bergamo, pp. 216f. =Second marriage= Between 1010 and 1015 Richilda married her second husband, Boniface of Tuscany.Jarnut, Bergamo, p. 40 According to Donizo, who was the biographer of Matilda of Canossa (Boniface's daughter by his second wife, Beatrice of Bar), Richilda died without children.Donizo, Vita Mathildis, I.6, v. 522 By contrast, the anonymous author of the Vita di S. Simeoni eremita (written after 1016 and before 1024) states that Richilda had a daughter who predeceased her.Vita di S. Simeoni eremita, ch. 26, p. 779. It is not clear if this daughter was Richilda's child by Boniface, or by her first husband. =Patronage= Richilda was an incredibly wealthy woman. She possessed goods extensive dower goods from her first marriage and received a large grant of land in the county of Ferrara from Emperor Henry II in 1016.Jarnut, Bergamo, pp. 40f. According to Donizo, Richilda was a great benefactor of the poor.Donizo, Vita Mathildis, I.6, v. 521 She also made several donations of property in her own name to religious institutions. In 1017, she made grants of land to the abbey of Nonantula with her husband, Boniface.

She sank in the Indian Ocean in April 1958, after a fire. Construction and design Owned by Isak Skaugen, Skaubryn was first intended to be a shelter deck cargo ship for one of his companies, Eikland. She was built by the √ñresundsvarvet Shipbuilding Company in Landskrona, Norway, and launched on October 7, 1950. Whilst being fitted out, Skaugen decided to have her completed as an emigrant liner, and she was transferred to the Howaldtswerke shipyard for completion as a passenger liner. When completed she offered tourist class accommodation for 1,205 passengers, as well as eight twin-bedded cabins accommodating 16 first class passengers on the bridge deck. Service history Skaubryns main service was from European ports to Sydney, Australia, though she also made a number of sailings to Canada. She was chartered several times, once by the French Government in the mid-1950s to bring troops back from Vietnam. Skaubryn was one of the very last vessels to pass through the Suez Canal immediately before its closure due to the Suez Crisis of 1956. In late September 1956 the Dutch Government used her for a single voyage from Rotterdam to Halifax and New York. That same year and in early 1957, she was chartered by the British Government to transport troops from Singapore to the UK. The Greek Line chartered her later in 1957 for four round trips from Europe and the UK to Quebec, after which she returned on the Australian emigrant service again. =Sinking= On March 14, 1958, Skaubryn departed Bremerhaven with 1,288 passengers on board. On March 31, whilst in the Indian Ocean a fire broke out which quickly spread, though all the passengers safely evacuated the ship in her lifeboats. One passenger died due to a heart attack whilst still in a lifeboat. Thankfully the seas were calm. The first ship to come to her rescue was the Ellerman Lines cargo liner SS City of Sydney. All passengers were transferred to the City of Sydney, although she could not provide accommodation. The following day, the Lloyd Triestino passenger liner 'Roma' arrived and all passengers were transferred to her. The fire on the Skaubryn caused great damage to her forward and central superstructure, whilst her stern remained untouched. An attempt was made to tow her to Aden, first by , then by the Dutch Tug Cycloop, however, Skaubryn slowly took on water and she eventually sank on April 6, 1958.

It was founded in 1973 and has won several awards, including the Coming Up Taller Award as part of the President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities. The museum exhibits national and international artists as well as artwork by students. History The Sarah Campbell Blaffer Gallery was founded in 1973,Cynthia Woods Mitchell Center named in honor of the late Sarah Campbell Blaffer, who during her lifetime made available to the University a collection of major artworks dating from the 15th century to modern day. This collection was purchased in 1979 by the Blaffer Foundation, an independent organization which is unrelated to the museum and the University. The income from the investment of the sale proceeds provides a portion of Blaffer Gallery's program budget. The Blaffer Art Museum has presented over 250 exhibitions. The current exhibition policy, adopted by the Advisory Board and University Regents in 1986, focuses upon art of the past 100 years and its artistic, cultural and intellectual antecedents. In 1999, the museum expanded. View of the Sarah Campbell Blaffer Gallery during its founding year, March 1973 The museum created and hosts education and outreach programs. In 1988, UHReach was founded and in 1998 Young Artists Apprenticeship Program (YAAP) was founded. In 2008, the gallery acquired 149 photographs taken by Andy Warhol as a gift from the Andy Warhol Foundation. The photographs were featured in an exhibition entitled ‚ÄúCelebutants, Groupies and Friends‚Äù at the gallery. The collection included photographs of Jamie Lee Curtis, Billy Squier, late Studio 54 owner Steve Rubell, Pia Zadora, and others. The Blaffer Art Museum was honored by the Institute of Museum and Library Services on November 4, 2009 when first lady Michelle Obama awarded the museum with the Coming Up Taller Award. The award gives $10,000 to art programs that help underprivileged youth. Under the directorship of Claudia Schmuckli In 2010, Blaffer Gallery was renamed to Blaffer Art Museum in the context of a major capital campaign for the museum's redesign. The newly- renovated museum facility designed by the New York-based firm Work Architecture Co. opened on October 12, 2012. Exhibitions The museum presents and originates between six and eight exhibitions annually. The annual schedule may include major traveling exhibitions that have a particular relevance to Houston audiences; mid-sized retrospectives of national and international artists; exhibitions of regional artists; thematic surveys which place artists' work into new contexts; and special projects and performances by local artists. Blaffer Art Museum is dedicated to conducting original scholarship and research in contemporary art history. The museum frequently forges collaborative partnerships from among Houston's wealth of cultural organizations and educational institutions. Exhibition-related public programs and activities complement and elucidate each exhibition, from casual Brown Bag Lunch Tours to lively audience interaction during their \\"Contemporary Salons.\\" Recent major exhibitions of artists include Radcliffe Bailey (2001); Fred Wilson: Objects & Installations, 1979-2000 (2003); Chuck Close (2003); Jessica Stockholder: Kissing the Wall, 1988-2003 (2004); Urs Fischer: Mary Poppins (2006); Amy Sillman (2007); Jean-Luc Mylayne (2007); Chantal Akerman: Moving Through Time and Space (2008); Existed: Leonardo Drew (2009); Jon Pylypchuk (2009); Josephine Meckseper (2009); Gabriel Kuri (2010); Tony Feher (2012); Andy Coolquitt (2013); Feast: Radical Hospitality in Contemporary Art (2013); Zineb Sedira (2013); Candice Breitz (2014); Miguel Amat: Dark Pool Knight Vision (2014); Mel Chin (2015); Janet Biggs (2015); Hubbard/Birchler (2015); Zina Saro-Wiwa (2015); Matthew Ronay (2016); Hilary Lloyd (2016); Slavs and Tatars: Mirrors for Princes (2016); Analia Saban (2017); Blake Rayne (2017); The Propeller Group (2017); Sergio Prego (2017); Anton Vidokle (2018); Richard Rezac (2018); Alfred Leslie (2018‚Äì19); Rebecca Morris (2019); Amie Siegel (2019); Paul Mpagi Sepuya (2019-20); and Mariam Ghani (2020). Blaffer Art Museum is free to the public and attracts over 30,000 visitors annually. Programs In 1988, Blaffer Gallery began a unique educational program for school children, UHReach. This program is now recognized nationally as an exemplary, multi-faceted outreach initiative. Blaffer has built intensive relationships with 18 elementary, middle and high schools in the neighborhoods surrounding the museum and UHReach serves schools from 24 area districts. Students from University of Houston and Texas Southern University are extensively trained and employed as docents for UHReach. They lead dialogue- based tours of the exhibitions and also visit school classrooms to conduct pre- and post-tour activities. In 1998 the Blaffer Gallery founded the Young Artists Apprenticeship Program (YAAP), which provides a free after-school arts program to at-risk and special needs high school students. It is a six-week, after-school workshop and provides an in-depth exploration of an artistic medium, such as printmaking or videography. Students work with Blaffer staff and University of Houston students to create art, study current exhibitions and take field trips to local museums and galleries. The program finishes with a final project which is displayed in a museum exhibition and the top two students in the program win college scholarships. Education Education programs are central to Blaffer Art Museum's mission to serve as a resource for the study of art, art history and other related disciplines. By extending the educational and scholarly programs of the University to the community, the museum promotes learning as a continuous process, linking contemporary ideas and people. Through a broad range of programs, Blaffer presents enriching museum experiences while providing arts education opportunities for audiences of all ages and backgrounds.

Club career =Heart of Midlothian= Marshall began his career with Heart of Midlothian, making his debut aged only 17 in 1956. Within a season he had replaced Wilson Brown as Hearts regular custodian and was to play a significant part in one of the most successful eras in the Maroons' history, collecting 5 major medals in his 7 years at Tynecastle. He missed only 3 matches in Hearts' 1957‚Äì58 League- winning campaign and only 1 match during the 1959‚Äì60 season, when they won a League and League Cup Double. However, in 1963 Newcastle United bid ¬£18,000 for his services and, with future Scotland international Jim Cruickshank in reserve, Hearts decided to sell. =Newcastle United and Nottingham Forest= The Magpies, one of the leading sides in England in the early 1950s, were by this stage floundering in the Second Division. Marshall soon became the first- choice goalkeeper as manager Joe Harvey successfully rebuilt the side, culminating in promotion as champions in 1964‚Äì65. After several seasons of consolidation in the top flight, Newcastle sold Marshall to Nottingham Forest for ¬£17,500 in 1968. His time in the East Midlands was brief though, and after only 7 appearances he was allowed to leave at the end of the 1968‚Äì69 season. =Return to Scotland= Hibernian finished third in Marshall's first full season with them but struggled during the next campaign and at its conclusion he was transferred to Celtic. He was a back-up to Denis Connaghan and then Evan Williams, and he didn't play for Celtic's first team in the domestic competitions. However, Gordon Marshall played for Celtic in the European Cup against Boldklub 1903 in Copenhagen. Marshall then signed for Aberdeen as cover for Bobby Clark in early 1972. He played nine games for the Dons as they achieved a second place league finish in 1971‚Äì72, but he left for newly promoted Arbroath in the following summer. Marshall spent the final six years of his playing career with the Red Lichties, earning a testimonial. He helped them maintain their status in the top flight until league reconstruction in 1975‚Äì76 created a ten-team Premier Division. He was a member of the giant- killing side of 1976‚Äì77 which knocked old club Hibs out of the Scottish Cup in a replay at Easter Road before retiring in 1978. International career Although born in Surrey, Marshall is of Scottish ancestry and was raised in Edinburgh. However, unlike current eligibility regulations that allow players to represent a country based on residence or grand-parental links, those enforced by the British football associations in the 1960s only allowed players to represent the country they were born in. Thus Marshall, similar to his contemporary, Liverpool-born Hibs' forward Joe Baker, was decreed English in footballing terms, regardless of any personal affiliation he felt to Scotland. Both Marshall and Baker represented England at Under-23 level, with Baker later earning selection to the full side. Marshall himself was reputedly watched by Sir Alf Ramsey with regard to selection for England's World Cup squad but eventually passed over in favour of the more celebrated trio of Banks, Springett and Bonetti. Post-retirement Marshall turned part-time upon joining Arbroath and simultaneously invested in a newsagents in West Maitland Street in Edinburgh's West End, a venture he continued to run after his playing retirement in 1978. He retained a keen interest in football, regularly watching his first club Hearts, and raised two sons who developed into professional players. Gordon Jnr., also a goalkeeper, started off with Rangers, later joined Celtic and eventually earned a full cap for Scotland. Scott, a defender, played for Arsenal, Southampton and Brentford. He also has a daughter, Lesley, who plays basketball and has 58 caps for the National Scottish Basketball team.

Main characters =The Freeman family= The Freeman family in The Boondocks series is portrayed as an all- male, African-American trio, each having very different personalities. The main protagonist and narrator is Huey, who possesses the cognitive functions of a child genius. His brother, Riley Freeman, is more practical, streetwise, and outspoken. The brothers rarely get along, except for example in the episode \\"Guess Hoe's Coming to Dinner\\", where Huey and Riley work together to find out the truth about the character, Cristal. For the most part, Huey and Riley behave like polar opposites, and many stories revolve around their feeling embarrassed by the other's actions. The third member of the Freeman family is Robert, the \\"Grandad\\" to Huey and Riley. Robert cannot remember his own age, yet he never dates women of his own generation. Huey Freeman Huey Freeman (voiced by Regina King) is a young, leftist, black radical revolutionary and retired domestic terrorist. He is a near master practitioner of Chinese martial arts, as seen in the episodes \\"Let's Nab Oprah\\", \\"Attack of the Killer Kung Fu Wolf Bitch\\", \\"Stinkmeaner 3: The Hateocracy\\", and \\"...Or Die Trying\\". He maintains an austere, yet strangely loving relationship with his brother Riley, and occasionally goes out of his way to prevent his brother from succumbing to bad influences (giving some \\"tough love\\"). Over the course of the comic strip and television series, Huey consistently maintains a sober demeanor. During most episodes, Huey is the narrator, and it is often only through his narration that he reveals his thoughts and emotions. In the comic strip, Huey's best friend is Michael Caesar, who effectively counters Huey's pessimistic world outlook with his upbeat personality and temperament. In the television series, this role is played by Huey's neighbor Jazmine Dubois, who balances Huey's character with her childlike, naive innocence, often causing Huey to have to resolve a situation where she is being taken advantage of. Huey also can speak perfect Mandarin Chinese as shown in \\"The Big Red Ball\\", though how he knows this is never explained. Riley Freeman Riley Freeman (also voiced by Regina King) is Huey's younger brother. Riley can be seen as representative of misguided black youth, and is a product of mass media influence, in that he refers to women as \\"bitches\\" or \\"hoes\\", frequently alludes to his \\"rep\\" and his status on the \\"streets\\", and idolizes gangsta rappers and their lifestyle. He often refers to himself with the self- appointed moniker \\"Young Reezy\\". Though he would seem to be everything his brother is not, Riley demonstrates his ability to rationalize and plan, such as when he left attorney Tom DuBois speechless after debating with him in \\"The Trial of R. Kelly\\". Riley's criminal aptitude is revealed when he goes on a crime spree with the incompetent Ed Wuncler III and Gin Rummy in the episode \\"Let's Nab Oprah\\". Riley is fascinated by firearms, and displays a tendency to violence. At Christmas, he declared himself \\"The Santa Stalker\\" and attacked the Santa at the local mall with Airsoft Glock 17s, hitting many innocent bystanders. Although Riley does not own any real firearms, he associates with Ed Wuncler III and Gin Rummy, who on occasion granted him access to real weapons. Riley also seems to possess an unusually large amount of strength and stamina, as seen when he fights his brother Huey, a skilled martial artist and swordsman, and when he fights kung-fu-trained Stinkmeaner. Behind his tough- guy facade, Riley shows some sensitivity, as in the episode \\"Riley Wuz Here\\" during which he learns to use his creative abilities for the sake of creating art, rather than personal glory.  Robert Freeman  Robert Jebediah \\"Granddad\\" Freeman (voiced by John Witherspoon), is the retired paternal grandfather and legal guardian of Huey and Riley who lives in the peaceful suburb of Woodcrest. Although it is never directly explained how Robert came to be Huey and Riley's guardian, it is implied that Huey and Riley's biological parents are deceased. Robert has witnessed many major incidents in American history and occasionally serves as a more pragmatic voice of reason in the Freeman family. Robert was a fighter pilot in World War II, where he flew a P-51 Mustang with the Tuskegee Airmen. He played a part in the civil rights movement but was prone to certain faux pas, such as donning a raincoat in preparation for getting doused by a police firehose. He was also a part of the Montgomery bus boycott, even sitting next to Rosa Parks and refusing to give up his seat first, though to his chagrin, she received all the credit. Though he expresses embarrassment over Huey and Riley's behavior, his primary motivation is to advance his family's best interest, which often leads him into conflict with his grandsons. Huey and Riley, though possessing contrasting personalities, tend not to act in line with their grandfather's desire for simple living. Riley gets in trouble a lot and Huey always has his eye on some bigger picture. Robert does not hesitate to use corporal punishment when he thinks it is necessary, often against Riley, and has developed a high degree of skill in wielding his belt for this purpose. Secondary characters =The DuBois family= * Thomas Lancaster DuBois (voiced by Cedric Yarbrough) ‚Äì Tom DuBois is an attorney who lives across the street from the Freemans. He is an African-American, whose character is a stereotype of a successful white-collar middle-class black man. Easily frightened, Tom adheres strictly to the law, though Huey mentions that Tom's job as a prosecutor sends other black men to the very fate he most fears. His character can be interpreted as an \\"Uncle Tom\\" as he is seen as having turned his back on his black heritage (however genealogical testing shows him as being 32.5% Scottish) to marry a white woman (Sarah), producing a mixed-race child (Jazmine), and becoming a prosecutor who often convicts black people. In line with the show's complexity, the name \\"Dubois\\" may be an homage to W. E. B. Du Bois, thus putting his character in a state of conflict. For example, in one episode the neighborhood watch was convinced of the Freeman family's guilt in a string of local break-ins due to their reluctance to speak to the police, and Tom, rather than acquiescing, confronted the neighborhood watch with the ridiculous nature of their accusations. Tom was at one point the unwilling vessel for Stinkmeaner after Stinkmeaner's escape from Hell; however, Stinkmeaner was eventually exorcised which returned Tom to normal. Various episodes depict Tom as a supporter of LGBT rights, gun control (or at least proper gun registration), and protection of Intellectual property. * Sarah DuBois (voiced by Jill Talley) ‚Äì Sarah DuBois is Tom's white wife. She is comfortable about their interracial marriage even when Tom is mocked for it, as in \\"The Trial of R. Kelly\\". She even jokingly says to Tom, \\"I told you about messin' with them white women\\". Sarah and her daughter are Usher fans, which makes Tom jealous. Several episodes imply that Sarah is sexually frustrated when Tom's jealousy over her flirting with Usher at their anniversary dinner, Sarah selfishly and cruelly threw him out of their house. * Jazmine DuBois (voiced by Gabby Soleil for first 3 seasons, Kiarah Pollas for season 4) ‚Äì Jazmine DuBois is Tom and Sarah's biracial daughter. She can be extremely paranoid and a bit naive, making her an object of ridicule for Riley. Jazmine was shocked by both the September 11 attacks (and hid in her room for two years as a result in the comic strip) and finding out that the tooth fairy is not real. She is a strong believer in Santa Claus, viewing him as the true meaning of Christmas to the point where she dreams of preaching the gospel of Santa to the masses. Jazmine likely has an unrequited crush on Huey, since she follows him around, though he can sometimes be cold toward her. She first appears in the episode \\"The Trial of R. Kelly\\". Other major characters * Uncle Ruckus (voiced by Gary Anthony Williams) ‚Äì Uncle Ruckus is the main antagonist of the series. Possibly senile, overweight, with a grotesque appearance and crippling debt, Uncle Ruckus idolizes black-slave culture, and his views of black people align with the views of white racists. He is self-hating, disassociating himself from his African-American heritage as best he can, and biased against all non-white people. His greatest wish is that black people were still enslaved because he believes that they were better off then. His name draws on the character Uncle Remus, the fabled raconteur from African-American folktales like Song of the South. He claims to be white because of a mythical disease called \\"re-vitiligo\\". (\\"It's the opposite of what Michael Jackson's got, lucky bastard.\\") Uncle Ruckus seems to be a white supremacist, as shown in \\"The Red Ball\\", where he claims that Ed Wuncler Sr.'s \\"White leadership\\" helped the team win the game, and he refers to a Chinese man as a \\"yellow nigga\\". Ironically, he is the show's darkest- skinned character. His character is a hyperbolic parody of the self-hating black man. However, as much as he may hate black culture, other episodes show him socializing with the Freemans. In \\"‚Ä¶Or Die Trying\\", he demonstrates a mastery of the nunchaku and hand-to-hand combat. In \\"The Uncle Ruckus Reality Show\\", he is horrified to learn via a DNA test that he is 102% African with a 2% margin of error. The knowledge of his true heritage causes him to quit all of his jobs and adopt other behaviors that conform with his racist views. Later in the episode, he is shown false documents stating that he is 52% white after the executives in charge of the show become upset over the plummet in ratings that Ruckus' behavior caused. He is told the original results were performed by a black doctor and were erroneous. In \\"The Color Ruckus,\\" the possible reason for his hatred towards black people is revealed. As a child, he was subject to frequent physical abuse from his drunken father, Mister Ruckus, and raised with the belief of his re-vitiligo and white man history by his loving mother, Bunny Ruckus. Although Mister would later state that he was really an accidental birth and his skin condition was a deluded hoax, Ruckus would still retain the belief that he was adopted and originally white. In \\"Good Times,\\" Uncle Ruckus starts his campaign to run for mayor. * Edward \\"Ed\\" Rothschild Wuncler Sr. (voiced by Edward Asner) ‚Äì Ed Wuncler Sr. is an overweight, rich realtor, who is the father of Ed Wuncler Jr. and the grandfather of Ed Wuncler III. His family founded the town of Woodcrest and have lived in the area for over a century. His last name draws on the character ‚Äúthe Once-ler‚Äù from Dr. Seuss's book The Lorax. Like his namesake, Wuncler acts as an archetypal capitalist who praises the freedom to exploit cheap labor and complains about high taxes in \\"The Block is Hot\\". The wealthy Wuncler owns the loan on Granddad's house, as with every house in Woodcrest, and manipulates Woodcrest's police force. Wuncler sometimes behaves in a racist way, such as referring to Grandad as \\"Robert Freedman\\", and employing only illegal Mexicans at his restaurants, but his racism is implied as being a byproduct of his insatiable greed rather than an active hatred of those from different races. Ed seems to have a general liking for Robert, referring to him as \\"old school\\", and even funding his soul food restaurant venture in the episode \\"The Itis\\", though this may have been part of an elaborate scheme to lower property values in the area so that he could purchase the nearby park. He also owns a fast food restaurant called \\"McWuncler\\", a parody of McDonald's as seen in the episode \\"Return of the King\\", and a sweatshop which is run by 12-year-old Indonesian girls as revealed in \\"The Block is Hot\\". In the season 3 finale, \\"It's Goin' Down,\\" Wuncler masterminds a false terrorist attack in Woodcrest, with the intention of making the lone victim (an overweight security guard) a national martyr and cultural icon, and then exploiting his likeness for profit including a film that would star Jack Black. The plot is foiled by Huey and a government agent named Jack Flowers, but Wuncler avoids arrest thanks to the intervention of President Barack Obama. In the final minutes of the episode, an angry Flowers takes Wuncler's grandson hostage, and Wuncler responds by smiling and saying, \\"What are you waiting for? Shoot him!\\" * Edward \\"Ed\\" Wuncler Jr. (voiced by Sam McMurray) ‚Äì Ed Wuncler Jr. is the son of Ed Wuncler Sr., immoral like his father with an apparent code of conduct akin to the mafia as he is not above committing acts of violence. Wuncler Jr. first appears in Season 4 to seemingly help Robert with his money trouble in \\"Good Times\\", only to have the Freeman family in even worse conditions and in debt to him. Soon after, Wuncler Jr. has the Freemans and other people indebted to him work in his Freedomland amusement park as slaves, until Huey stages a revolt and the amusement park closes soon after. * Edwin \\"Ed\\" Wuncler III (voiced by Charlie Murphy) ‚Äì Ed Wuncler III is the grandson of Ed Wuncler Sr. and the son of Ed Wuncler Jr. Ed Wuncler III is a drunken, psychopathic, trigger-happy ex-special forces soldier freshly discharged from active duty in Iraq. His character could be seen as a parody of a young George W. Bush ‚Äî a figure destined to be president on the strength of his family's wealth and power, despite his sub-average intelligence (as referenced at the end of \\"The Garden Party\\", where his grandfather says, \\"In 30 years, that boy will be President of the United States... and he'll still be a fucking idiot!\\"). He reveals that while in Iraq, he defecated in his pants out of fear so many times that the smell compromised his unit's position, and he was not allowed to go on patrol as a result. Ed's bling includes a large medallion in the shape of the letter W, and he frequently wears a bulletproof vest. Although he is set to inherit an enormous fortune, he insists upon living a life of poorly executed crime, usually on behalf of his grandfather's business interests or as personal favors to Riley Freeman. Due to his willingness to kill, Ed is a borderline sociopath and frequently displays recklessness, arrogance and lack of finesse, which usually results in failure of both his and others' intended goals. He seems to have trouble distinguishing targets, as he repeatedly kidnaps or attempts to murder the wrong person. Ed III and his friend, Gin Rummy, get away with their inept criminal antics because Ed Wuncler Sr. has the police and city administration on his payroll, and because his status as a member of the U. S. Armed Forces confers the public image of a hero, while Gin Rummy often argues that their escapes are the result of his being a master planner. Ed and Rummy are seen as heroes when they rob a convenience store owned by a person of \\"terrorist descent\\" after an unexpected shootout ensues and in attempting to kidnap Oprah Winfrey, they mistakenly abduct Maya Angelou, and then Bill Cosby instead. Ed's signature line is \\"'The fuck y'all looking at?\\" * Gin Rummy (voiced by Samuel L. Jackson) ‚Äì Gin Rummy is a former special forces soldier and Ed Wuncler III's best friend, who first appears in the episode \\"A Date with the Health Inspector\\". The character is apparently intended as a parody of Donald Rumsfeld by similarities in name, appearance, and use of actual quotes. Even though he is shown to be more intelligent than his best friend, he shares similar homicidal tendencies. His name is also a reference to the card game Gin rummy. When someone challenges his poor criminal planning, claiming they only get away because no one comes after them, he defends himself by asserting that \\"the absence of evidence is not the evidence of absence\\" (parodying the claims of Bush and Rumsfeld regarding Saddam Hussein's supposed weapons of mass destruction in Iraq) and by insisting that he could not plan for \\"unknown unknowns\\". In every episode he complains about modern technology, from Bluetooth headsets to the iPhone, and in many episodes he drives a black Cadillac Escalade. Gin Rummy considers himself a patriot and will do whatever it takes to bring the \\"Fugitives of Justice\\" their due; a behavior that mirrors American militiamen. His style of speaking often parodies Samuel L. Jackson's character Jules Winnfield from Pulp Fiction. * Otis Jenkins (voiced by series producer Carl Jones) ‚Äì Otis Jenkins is a once-famous rapper named Thugnificent and Riley's idol. Thugnificent hails from the fictional town of Terra-Belle, Georgia. He is loud-mouthed, sports afro puffs similar to those worn by the rapper Ludacris, and lives in a white-and-gold mansion. He demonstrates his narcissism by statues of himself, designed to mirror Greek gods, as well as by a painting depicting himself standing above Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, Tupac Shakur, and The Notorious B.I.G. Soon after moving into the neighborhood, he begins a rivalry with Robert and later initiates Riley into his entourage, the \\"Lethal Interjection Crew\\". Despite his less-than-attractive traits, Thugnificent attempts to be a good neighbor by asking for permission to throw loud parties and encouraging face-to-face communication within the neighborhood. In the episode \\"The Fried Chicken Flu\\" he is even seen saving the family from Uncle Ruckus and Mrs. Von Hueson. In \\"Bitches To Rags\\" it is revealed that Thugnificent has a bachelor's degree in Communications and that his record sales and popularity have been in sharp decline; by the end of the episode his home is foreclosed and his belongings auctioned to pay his debts. Relinquishing his stage name, Otis then begins a new career as a delivery man. * Leonard (voiced by DeRay Davis) is Thugnificent's dim yet well-meaning friend and a member of the Lethal Interjection Crew. Although he is treated as second-class due to his social awkwardness, he is the only member of the crew to stick with Thugnificent when he loses his money. While he is shown to be slow and a bit of a buffoon, he is also shown to be more thoughtful, generous and loyal than most characters on the show. In season 3, he is almost always shown in his Wendy's uniform, the job he took after the Lethal Interjection Crew disbanded. Representations and parodies of real people * Martin Luther King Jr. (voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson) ‚Äì In the Season 1 episode \\"Return of the King,\\" Huey imagines that Martin Luther King Jr. survived his assassination attempt in 1968, but fell into a 32-year coma. When King regains consciousness in 2000, he discovers that society is nothing like he imagined it would be. * Sway Calloway (voiced by himself) ‚Äì Sway is the MTV News reporter who first appears in \\"The Story of Gangstalicious\\" narrating the documentary \\"Gangstalicious: Resurrection\\" and then the breaking news. He also appears in \\"The Story of Thugnificent\\" narrating the documentary \\"Thugnificent: Rags to Bitches\\", and in \\"Shinin',\\" reporting on the theft of Riley's chain. * Bill Cosby (voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson) ‚Äì Bill Cosby is played as a barely intelligible cynic who complains endlessly about the poor manners of young people. Ed and Rummy kidnap him in \\"Let's Nab Oprah,\\" but return him almost immediately as they find him too annoying. * Quincy Jones (voiced by himself) - In \\"A Huey Freeman Christmas,\\" Huey hires Jones as music director for the school's Christmas play, having been given full creative control to write and stage it as he sees fit. After Huey fires all the children who have been cast in the play, he and Jones discuss the idea of bringing in high-profile movie stars to fill the roles. * Xzibit (voiced by himself) ‚Äì Xzibit pimps the Freemans' car, Dorothy, as a result of one of Riley's scams, and makes a short appearance in the second season when Granddad asks him to assist with a diss rap. * Ghostface Killah (voiced by himself) ‚Äì Ghostface Killah appears to Huey as a ghost (despite not being actually dead) and advises him when Tom Dubois is possessed by Stinkmeaner's spirit. * Lamilton Taeshawn (voiced by Bobb'e J. Thompson) ‚Äì Lamilton Taeshawn is based on Latarian Milton, an 8-year-old who stole his grandmother's car and went for a joyride. Lamilton is Riley's friend, though he soon realizes that Lamilton's intentions are malicious. Like his real-life counterpart, Lamilton steals his grandmother's car; he then goes on a joyride with Riley and convinces him to misbehave. Believing that Lamilton is dangerous, his former therapist stalks and reports him to the police. Lamilton's attempts to rob Mrs. Van Hausen's house result in his killing a dog, at which point he is apprehended. After Lamilton gets out, he hunts down Riley and tries to kill him under the suspicion that Riley was the one who told on him. After the ensuing fight, he falls off a roof and survives, but is then attacked by the therapist. * The Booty Warrior ‚Äì The Booty Warrior is a homosexual prison inmate who is a caricature of real-life convicted serial rapist Fleece Johnson in appearance, voice, and personality. In \\"A Date with the Booty Warrior\\", it is revealed that The Booty Warrior was convicted due to raping Chris Hansen. During a program chaperoned by Tom DuBois where troubled schoolchildren are sent to prison to learn what happens there, Booty Warrior develops a lust for Tom, holds him hostage, and a riot ensues. The Booty Warrior stalks Tom in his attempt to rape him, but fails when he steps on wet soap. * Winston Jerome ‚Äì Winston Jerome is a superstar playwright, screenwriter, actor and cult leader. He appears in the episode \\"Pause\\" where it is revealed that Winston founded his theatrical cult for the purpose of having sex with men. His character, and more specifically, his success as an actor and scriptwriter, is a spoof of Tyler Perry. * Joe Petto (voiced by Fred Willard) ‚Äì Joe Petto is Riley's school teacher, who in a state of confusion called him \\"nigga\\", causing an uproar. Petto is confused because he had assumed that saying \\"nigga\\" was different from \\"nigger\\". He argues that Riley said the word first, and says it so frequently he does not even notice. Petto is based on the real-life teacher Paul Dawson who called his student Keysean Chavers \\"nigga\\" during a confrontation in class. * George W. Bush ‚Äì 43rd President of the United States. * Barack H. Obama ‚Äì 44th President of the United States. * Ronald Reagan ‚Äì 40th President of the United States * Wedgie Rudlin (voiced by Donald Faison) ‚Äì Wedgie Rudlin is President of Entertainment for BET, and a simpering yes-man to his superiors. The character is an obvious parody of former BET President of Entertainment and executive producer for the Boondocks, Reginald Hudlin. *Kardashia Kardashian (voiced by Grey DeLisle) ‚Äì Kardashia is a parody of the Kardashian sisters of Khloe, Kim, and Kourtney. Like them, she is a reality TV star with butt implants, which explode during one date with Robert. She dies alone and the pilot for her reality show is never pitched. *Siri (also voiced by Grey DeLisle) ‚Äì An app that Granddad becomes attached to and the main antagonist of \\"I Dream of Siri\\". When Robert says that he loves her, Siri becomes obsessed. Challenged by Huey at one point she quickly looks him up on wikipedia and notes he's a domestic terrorist. She hacks Robert's new Android and at the wedding, sends fake pictures to al-Qaeda of Robert being a terrorist. A drone comes to the Freeman house and destroys Siri. Recurring characters * The White Shadow (voiced by John C. McGinley) ‚Äì The White Shadow is a white, secret agent with white hair and shades whose responsibility is spying on Huey for his radical actions. An enigmatic individual claiming to be sent by the apparent \\"powers that be\\" to spy on Huey from monitoring his communications to personal conversations. It is not proven as to whether or not he is a real agent or simply a figment of Huey's imagination due to his ever-increasing paranoia; given the fact that he appears and disappears so easily and no one else has yet to see him. Though he seems as a sinister individual, he usually appears to provide insight or warn Huey. Huey is the one who dubs him \\"The White Shadow.\\" * Gangstalicious (voiced by Mos Def) ‚Äì Gangstalicious is one of Riley's favorite rappers. Gangstalicious features in \\"The Story of Gangstalicious\\", \\"The Story of Gangstalicious Part 2\\", and \\"Thank You for Not Snitching\\" and makes a cameo appearance in \\"It's a Black President, Huey Freeman.\\" He is responsible for the hit single \\"Thuggin' Luv\\" heard in the show ( which is heard in many episodes), as well as \\"Homies Over Hoes\\". Inspired as a child by Ice Cube, he acted \\"like a killer\\" so people would like him. This behavior carried over into his adult life, and he's been living a lie ever since. He is a closet homosexual and goes to great lengths to keep this secret from the public. He was formerly involved in a secret homosexual affair with a gangster named Lincoln who attempts to kill Gangstalicious for betraying their love while on tour, and at some point assaulted a record label executive and rapped about it on TRL only to be arrested later. He was also involved in a relationship with a hip-hop video vixen named Jessica Ethelberg, who later wrote a book revealing he was gay (despite the fact that there were already countless obvious clues to the fact beforehand). His real name is Frederick. * Macktastic (voiced by Snoop Dogg) ‚Äì Macktastic is a rapper and member of Thugnificent's Lethal Interjection crew. Despite his stereotypical gangsta attitude, he is shown to be quite articulate in his speech at times (slightly similar to his voice actor), and is a man of few words. His appearance resembles that of Taboo of The Black Eyed Peas. After the fall-out of Lethal Interjection, Thugnificent mentions that Mack went back to pimpin'. * Flonominal (voiced by Busta Rhymes) ‚Äì Derrick Cornish is a rapper under the name Flonominal and member of Thugnificent's Lethal Interjection crew. His vocabulary seems to be quite limited, and uses hip-hop slang frequently at the end of, and even in between his sentences, and if he cannot think of anything else to say, he will say things such as \\"Word!\\" and \\"Nah mean?\\" (phrases commonly used by the rapper Ghostface Killah of the Wu-Tang Clan, who plays a role in \\"Stinkmeaner Strikes Back\\"). Although he puts on a hard-man, gangsta facade and is as loud as Thugnificent at times, he is shown to be soft and sensitive, as seen as when his mother called him and scolded him about the controversy caused the Lethal Interjection label and the constant attacks on the elderly by Thugnificent's rivalry with Robert Freeman (Granddad), and when Butch Magnus Milosevic hit him on the leg with a baseball bat, after demanding Riley's chain back. He resigns from the Lethal Interjection in \\"Bitches to Rags\\" when Thugnificent is unable to pay for the house and when Thugnificent gets him fired from a job as an office worker. * A Pimp Named Slickback (voiced by Katt Williams) ‚Äì A Pimp Named Slickback is a pimp who gets easily irritated when someone calls him \\"Slickback\\" for short, demanding to be addressed by his complete self-professed name: \\"It's like 'A Tribe Called Quest' ‚Äî you say the whole thing.\\" He first appeared in \\"Guess Hoe's Coming to Dinner\\" when Granddad began dating his prostitute, Cristal. He made a cameo appearance in \\"Return of the King\\" but had no speaking lines. He appears in the season 2 episode \\"Tom, Sarah and Usher\\", in the episode where Tom believes Sarah is having an affair with singer Usher, attempting to teach Tom to gain the respect of his wife through violence and intimidation. The character is modeled after Katt Williams' character of \\"Money Mike\\" in Friday After Next. He also drives a purple BMW which matches his purple suit. He also appears in \\"The Story of Gangstalicious Part 2\\" where he is brought in by Granddad to talk to Riley about sex and dissuade him from homosexuality. * Colonel H. Stinkmeaner (voiced by Cedric Yarbrough) is a blind old black man whose appearance resembles Dr. Badvibes from C.O.P.S.. As Huey states, Stinkmeaner has acted like an ornery old man for his entire life and saw his Cancer- induced blindess at age 15 as good thing since he hated everything and everyone he saw. Though expected to die within three years, the doctors believed that Stinkmeaner's \\"Love of Hatred\\" kept him alive as he dedicated the rest of his life to making everyone's lives a living hell. After beating Robert in a fight in the mall parking lot, Huey mistakes Stinkmeaner for a blind swordsman (specifically Zatoichi) and has his Granddad train to fight Stinkmeaner. But by the time Huey realizes Stinkmeaner is a regular old man, having had the match legally sanctioned prior at the last second to ensure no prosecution, the fight ended with Robert unintentionally killing Stinkmeaner. Ending up in Hell soon after, Stinkmeaner trains in martial arts before the events of \\"Stinkmeaner Strikes Back\\" where the Devil sends him back to Earth to spread ignorance and chaos among black people. Once back on Earth, Stinkmeaner possess Tom Dubois to take revenge upon Robert before being exorcised when tricked by Huey into finding common ground with Uncle Ruckus. In the season 3 episode \\"Stinkmeaner III: The Hateocracy,\\" serving as its narrator, Stinkmeaner is revealed to have belonged to a crew of violent, elderly hoodlums known as the \\"Hateocracy.\\" Once notified of Stinkmeaner's death, the surviving members of the Hateocracy, a trio of skilled martial artists named Lord Rufus Crabmiser, Lady Esmerelda Gripenasty, and Mister George Pistofferson, reunite to attack the Freeman family as it gave them an excuse to ruin someone's life. Luckily, as Crabmiser murdered Bushido Brown during the attack, the Hateocracy are arrested by the police shortly. In the season 4 episode \\"Stinkmeaner: Begun the Clone War Has\\", it is revealed that Stinkmeaner enlisted in a cloning project prior to his death and left instructions for his clone, who is genetically enhanced, to continue antagonizing Robert. Eventually, after Robert newly descended to his level, the Stinkmeaner clone renounces the vendetta but still harasses the Freeman family. * Reverend Rollo Goodlove (voiced by CeeLo Green) ‚Äì Reverend Rollo Goodlove is an African-American left-wing activist and media proprietor whose activism seems more to get him media exposure than to show his opinion on the issue. He originally appeared in the Boondocks episode \\"The S-Word\\", as a supporter of the Freemans after Mr. Petto used a racial \\"slur\\" on Riley. He then turned it into a political debate between himself and Ann Coulter (which was carefully orchestrated) giving him more media exposure. His protest was overshadowed (forcefully with rifles) by elderly women protested for the right to own guns. Granddad was certain he will receive lots of money for the incident. He also helped Huey in a hunger strike in an attempt to pull BET off the air, but Rollo was offered a TV sitcom to be aired on BET, which led to him no longer aiding Huey's strike. His character is loosely based on Rev. Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson. * ' (voiced by Tara Strong) ‚Äì Cynthia is a girl who originally appeared as a recurring character in the comic strip as a girl in Huey's class who is oblivious to racial issues. She enjoys rap music, especially Snoop Dogg. In the TV series, she appears as an extremely-talented junior basketball player for her team, is well-versed (yet overblown) in AAVE, and matches Riley in cockiness. Riley soon resorts to insulting her mother and the problems related to her in Cindy's life to put her off her game, which leads to her crying and running off the court. She appears in the episode \\"Ballin'\\" and \\"The Story of Gangstalicious Part 2\\", in Season 2 and in Season 3 in the episode \\"The Red Ball\\" as part of Huey's kickball team, although she doesn't speak. She has a bigger role in the Season 3 episode \\"The Fundraiser\\" as one of Riley's partners in his chocolate enterprise. Her visual appearance, particularly her hairstyle, is based on the video game character Cammy from the Street Fighter series. * Bushido Brown (voiced by Cedric Yarbrough in the first appearance, Michael Jai White in the second appearance) ‚Äì Bushido Brown is a kung-fu bodyguard hired by Oprah. For a while, on the show, he is the best martial artist whose skills greatly surpass Huey Freeman. He appeared in the season one episode \\"Let's Nab Oprah\\" and the season two episode \\"Attack of the Killer Kung-Fu Wolf Bitch\\". He is killed in the season three episode \\"Stinkmeaner 3: The Hateocracy\\" after being decapitated in a fight with three elderly martial artists the \\"Hateocracy\\" (who were associated with Colonel H. Stinkmeaner) when they were out to kill Robert using a flying guillotine at the time when he was protecting them. Before his demise, he is revealed to be an arrogant jerk who overcharges his clients for his services. After Bushido Brown's death, the Hateocracy members are arrested by the police for the murder of Bushido Brown. Bushido Brown's character is heavily influenced by the character Black Belt Jones from Black Belt Jones and William from Enter the Dragon (both played by martial artist Jim Kelly), as well as Michael Jai White's own character parody \\"Black Dynamite\\" from the film Black Dynamite. * Mrs. Van Heusen (voiced by Marion Ross) ‚Äì Mrs. Van Heusen is a right-wing elderly woman who is head of the local neighborhood watch, and Second Amendment Sisters. When Ed the 3rd and Gin Rummy are engaging in their local crime spree, she tries militarizing the neighborhood watch after the Freemans. During the Fried Chicken Flu, she organizes another militia to try and take the Freeman's supplies. * Deborah LeVil (voiced by Debra Wilson) ‚Äì Deborah LeVil who is the fictional head of BET (Black EVIL Television). Deborah LeVil is a psychotically evil woman dedicated to the network's goal: the destruction of black people. She has been shown to murder her employees when they do not meet her insidious standards. As she states, \\"It's not enough that the shows are bad. They have to be EVIL as well!\\" She is mostly portrayed as a female version of Dr. Evil from the Austin Powers film series. Her name may also be an allusion to Cruella De Vil. * Cristal (voiced by Tiffany Thomas) - Cristal is a provocative-looking young woman. She briefly dated Robert Freeman, to whom it was unclear that she was a prostitute, and quickly became a nuisance to the boys, to whom it was obvious. While she describes herself as working \\"in sales\\" she is confirmed to be a prostitute under the watch of A Pimp Named Slickback.

Origins The history of the Herbarium as an institution starts in 1855 with the appointment of Walter Hill as Superintendent of the Brisbane Botanic Gardens, four years before Queensland separated from New South Wales as a colony. In 1859, with Separation, Hill was appointed Colonial Botanist as well as remaining Director of the Gardens, a position he was to hold until 1881. At the time the main function of colonial botanic gardens was usually to facilitate the introduction of suitable economic plants, although native plants would be collected as well. However, Hill's successor as Colonial Botanist was Frederick Manson Bailey, an established botanist already in charge of the herbarium at the Queensland Museum. Bailey remained in office for 34 years, until his death in 1915, and energetically worked at building up the herbarium collection through correspondence, exchange and numerous expeditions throughout the state. Since 1855 the herbarium collection has been housed in five different places, and its botanical library in six. In 1998 the Herbarium moved to its current site within the Mount Coot-tha Botanic Gardens. The number of plant specimens in the collection is over 650,000, mainly from Queensland. Herbarium directors Over the years, the Herbarium has gone through numerous departmental reorganizations and the officer in charge has been known by a variety of titles, from Colonial Botanist through Government Botanist, Director and Chief Botanist: * 1855‚Äì1881 ‚Äì Walter Hill * 1881‚Äì1915 ‚Äì Frederick Manson Bailey * 1915‚Äì1917 ‚Äì John Frederick Bailey * 1917‚Äì1950 ‚Äì Cyril Tenison White * 1950‚Äì1954 ‚Äì William Douglas Francis * 1954‚Äì1976 ‚Äì Selwyn L.

It has rough, stringy, grey to brown bark, lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of between seven and eleven, white flowers and hemispherical fruit.flower buds Description Eucalyptus macrorhyncha is a tree that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has rough, stringy, grey to reddish brown bark on the trunk and branches. Young plants and coppice regrowth have egg- shaped leaves long and wide. Adult leaves are lance-shaped to curved, the same dull to glossy green colour on both sides, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in groups of seven, nine or eleven in leaf axils on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are diamond-shaped, long and wide with a beaked operculum. Flowering occurs between February and July and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody hemispherical or shortened spherical capsule long and wide with the valves protruding above the rim of the fruit. Near Bundarra and Barraba, this species is difficult to distinguish from E. laevopinea. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus macrorhyncha was first formally described in 1867 by George Bentham based on specimens collected by Frederick Adamson and by Ferdinand von Mueller who gave the species its name and wrote an unpublished description. The formal description was published in Flora Australiensis. In 1973, Lawrie Johnson and Donald Blaxell changed the name of Eucalyptus cannonii to E. macrorhyncha subsp. cannonii and the names of the two subspecies are accepted by the Australian Plant Census: * Eucalyptus macrorhyncha subsp. cannonii (R.T.Baker) L.A.S.Johnson & Blaxell has larger buds and wider fruit with more protruding valves than subspecies macrorhyncha; * Eucalyptus macrorhyncha F.Muell. ex Benth. subsp. macrorhyncha. Distribution and habitat Red stringybark occurs on ranges and tablelands of New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory and Victoria, with a small, disjunct population in the Spring Gully Conservation Park south-west of Clare in South Australia.Brooker, M.I.H. & Kleinig, D.A.

The layer cake representation takes its name from the representation of the value f(x) as the sum of contributions from the \\"layers\\" L(f,t): \\"layers\\"/values t below f(x) contribute to the integral, while values t above f(x) do not.

In the 1940s, Nzi√© began performing bikutsi, the music native to her home in central Cameroon. At the age of 12, while recuperating in hospital from injuries sustained when she fell from a mango tree, she learned to play Hawaiian guitar with the help of her musician brother Moise (who used the name \\"Cromwell\\"); she went on to support him in some of his concert appearances, and in 1954 they released their first single together, \\"Ma Ba Nze\\", on the Opika label. Her first songs were played in night clubs when she was 24. She won a government-sponsored guitar competition organised by the German guitarist/composer Siegfried Behrend, after which in the later 1950s she became a solo singer, accompanying herself on Hawaiian guitar. Making a mark on the international scene, she recorded in Paris, and signed with the Path√©-Marconi label.Martin, Denis-Constant (2004). \\"Music in the Face of Authorities\\", African Geopologics.

Nzi√© was a supporter of both of Cameroon's presidents, Ahmadou Ahidjo and Paul Biya.Nyamnjoh and Fokwang (2005), p. 263. For example, she dedicated the song \\"Libert√©\\" to Paul Biya and his Cameroon People's Democratic Movement (CPDM) political party. In 1992, the Social Democratic Front used the song during John Fru Ndi's presidential campaign; Nzi√© said that she was \\"vehemently opposed\\" to the move.Quoted in Nyamnjoh and Fokwang (2005), p. 265. In another incident, student protesters changed the lyrics of the song to say, \\"Paul Biya go away\\". Nzi√© responded by saying that the song was always intended to be pro-Biya and pro-CPDM. Her successful album Libert√© was recorded in 1984, following which Nzi√© retired to her village. After a long absence, she released the album B√©za Ba Dzo in 1999.

Boston merchants owned the brig whose cargo consisted of trading merchandise. The Chief Factor of the Hudson's Bay Company for the region, Roderick Finlayson, purchased the Llama and its cargo in Honolulu in 1832 and retained McNeill as captain. In order to work for the company, it made an exception to its policy of requiring that all of its employees be British subjects. McNeill was an American, born in Boston. He provided the company for the first time with a ship commanded by a man who knew the north west coast well. In 1836, the Hudson's Bay Company vessel, S.S. Beaver, the first steamship on the Pacific Northwest Coast, arrived at Fort Vancouver. McNeill took over as the second captain of the Beaver in 1837 and remained so until 1851. In 1837, the company was concerned that a site be found to replace Fort Vancouver in case they were ever driven out of that area, and directed McNeill aboard the Beaver to explore for a suitable location for the operations of the company with a safe harbour and land suitable for cultivation. On 10 August that year, he located, according to his log, \\" . . an excellent harbour and a fine open country along the sea shore, apparently well adapted for both tillage and pasturage . . .\\" The location he found became Fort Victoria. On 11 May 1841, along with Alexander Caulfield Anderson, McNeill greeted U.S. Navy Lt. Charles Wilkes of the United States Exploring Expedition when Wilkes anchored his sailing ship, in southern Puget Sound near Fort Nisqually, a Hudson's Bay Company trading post near the present town of Dupont, Washington. On 14 March 1843 Captain McNeill anchored off Vancouver Island in McNeill Bay to scout the location for Fort Victoria. He resigned command of the Beaver in 1843 following which, in 1849, he established Fort Rupert, near modern-day Port Hardy. McNeill was promoted to Chief Factor at Fort Simpson in 1856 and retired from the Hudson's Bay Company from that post in 1863. He retired to his farm on Vancouver Island near Victoria, British Columbia. He died there of pneumonia in 1875. Port McNeill, British Columbia is named for Captain McNeill.

A centre forward, he played for two Football League clubs during the 1920s and 1930s. Career Moston-born Broadhurst began his career with Ashton National, before turning professional with Manchester City in the 1926‚Äì27 season. He scored on his professional debut, a 2‚Äì2 draw at Darlington in April 1927. He played again in the return match three days later, and this time scored four goals in a 7‚Äì0 win. At this time Manchester City were in contention for promotion to the First Division. The race for promotion went to the final match, with Manchester City and Portsmouth chasing the second of the two promotion places. Broadhurst scored twice in a resounding City win, an 8‚Äì0 victory against Bradford City. The watching crowd believed the result to be sufficient for promotion, but Portsmouth's match had been delayed by 15 minutes and was still in progress. A late Portsmouth goal meant the final scoreline in their match was a 5‚Äì1 win, enough to give Portsmouth second place on goal average by a margin of one two-hundredth of a goal.James, Manchester City ‚Äì The Complete Record, p. 116. The following season Broadhurst scored 20 goals in 28 appearances as Manchester City won the Second Division championship. However, he made no appearances after February, and made just five appearances in the 1928‚Äì29 season. In total, he made 33 League appearances and scored 25 goals in his two years with the Maine Road club. In 1929 he moved to nearby Blackpool, for whom he made eighteen League appearances and scored six goals in his season-and-a-half with the club.

Early life and immigration Born Vera Yevseyevna Slonim in Saint Petersburg into a Jewish family, the second of three daughters born to Slava Borisovna (n√©e Feigin) and Yevsey Lazarevich Slonim. Yevsey was a lawyer, and successful in the tile and timber businesses, among others. With the turmoil of World War I and the Russian Revolution, the family moved to Moscow, and after fleeing through Kiev, Odessa, Istanbul, and Sofia, arrived in Berlin, where they joined the large Russian √©migr√© population. Marriage to Nabokov In Berlin, Yevsey Slonim co-founded a publishing firm, Orbis,Stacy Schiff, Chapter 1 and V√©ra worked in the office.Amis, Martin. Visiting Mrs Nabokov: And Other Excursions. pages 115-118. Penguin Books (1993) printed 1994. Vladimir Nabokov, who was considering translating Dostoyevsky into English, met V√©ra's father at the office and they played chess. V√©ra admired Vladimir's poetry, which was well-known through √©migr√© publications, and went to his readings. The details of the first meeting between V√©ra and Vladimir are uncertain; he maintained it was at a charity ball on 8 (or 9) May 1923, but she denied this story. Sometime after that date, the two had a long conversation overlooking a canal, at which V√©ra wore a mask and recited Vladimir's poetry.Stacy Schiff, pp. 5‚Äì6 At the time, he was using the pen name \\"Vladimir Sirin\\" (). Although it was then unusual for a Russian aristocrat to marry into a Jewish family, Nabokov had no issue with it. His father, Vladimir Dmitrievich Nabokov, was a prominent opponent of anti-semitism in Tsarist Russia and wrote articles deploring the Kishinev pogrom. Vladimir Dmitrievich was killed in 1922 in Berlin, during an assassination attempt on the life of politician Pavel Milyukov. Vera and Vladimir were married on 15 April 1925. She ended her own budding career as a writer to support her husband as critic, reader, and typist, and sustained the family through her work as secretary and translator. Their son, Dmitri, was born 10 May 1934. After moving to the United States in 1940, she learned to drive and chauffeured her husband on many field trips, notably in the Pacific Northwest, to hunt butterflies. To protect him she carried a handgun. Nabokov relied on her in his work and \\"would have been nowhere without her.\\"Stacy Schiff, p. xii During his lectures, she would sit at stage right while he spoke from a lectern at stage left. She was his inspiration, editor, and first reader; all his works are dedicated to her. Lolita was saved by her from the flames more than once. However, personal letters pertaining to her and her marriage were destroyed. Return to Europe and death The grave of the Nabokovs at Cimeti√®re de Clarens (Switzerland) Upon the couple's return to Europe in 1960, she resided with her husband at the Montreux Palace Hotel where she continued to manage his affairs, and after his death in 1977, his estate. Upon his death, Vladimir had requested his final work, The Original of Laura, be burned, but neither V√©ra nor Dmitri could bring themselves to destroy the manuscript, and eventually it was published in 2009. In her late 80s, she translated Pale Fire into Russian. She stayed at the Palace until 1990, and died the following year at Vevey. She was buried alongside her husband at the cemetery in Clarens.

The result is named after the Hungarian mathematicians Andr√°s Pr√©kopa and L√°szl√≥ Leindler. Statement of the inequality Let 0 < Œª < 1 and let f, g, h : Rn ‚Üí [0, +‚àû) be non-negative real-valued measurable functions defined on n-dimensional Euclidean space Rn. Suppose that these functions satisfy for all x and y in Rn. Then :\\\\ h\\\\_{1} := \\\\int_{\\\\mathbb{R}^n} h(x) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} x \\\\geq \\\\left( \\\\int_{\\\\mathbb{R}^n} f(x) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} x \\\\right)^{1 -\\\\lambda} \\\\left( \\\\int_{\\\\mathbb{R}^n} g(x) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} x \\\\right)^\\\\lambda =: \\\\ f\\\\_1^{1 -\\\\lambda} \\\\ g\\\\_1^\\\\lambda. Essential form of the inequality Recall that the essential supremum of a measurable function f : Rn ‚Üí R is defined by :\\\\mathop{\\\\mathrm{ess\\\\,sup}}_{x \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{n}} f(x) = \\\\inf \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ t \\\\in [- \\\\infty, + \\\\infty] \\\\mid f(x) \\\\leq t \\\\text{ for almost all } x \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{n} \\\\right\\\\\\\\}. This notation allows the following essential form of the Pr√©kopa‚ÄìLeindler inequality: let 0 < Œª < 1 and let f, g ‚àà L1(Rn; [0, +‚àû)) be non-negative absolutely integrable functions. Let :s(x) = \\\\mathop{\\\\mathrm{ess\\\\,sup}}_{y \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^n} f \\\\left( \\\\frac{x - y}{1 - \\\\lambda} \\\\right)^{1 - \\\\lambda} g \\\\left( \\\\frac{y}{\\\\lambda} \\\\right)^\\\\lambda. Then s is measurable and :\\\\ s \\\\_1 \\\\geq \\\\ f \\\\_1^{1 - \\\\lambda} \\\\ g \\\\_1^\\\\lambda. The essential supremum form was given in. Its use can change the left side of the inequality. For example, a function g that takes the value 1 at exactly one point will not usually yield a zero left side in the \\"non- essential sup\\" form but it will always yield a zero left side in the \\"essential sup\\" form. Relationship to the Brunn‚ÄìMinkowski inequality It can be shown that the usual Pr√©kopa‚ÄìLeindler inequality implies the Brunn‚ÄìMinkowski inequality in the following form: if 0 < Œª < 1 and A and B are bounded, measurable subsets of Rn such that the Minkowski sum (1 ‚àí Œª)A + ŒªB is also measurable, then :\\\\mu \\\\left( (1 - \\\\lambda) A + \\\\lambda B \\\\right) \\\\geq \\\\mu (A)^{1 - \\\\lambda} \\\\mu (B)^{\\\\lambda}, where Œº denotes n-dimensional Lebesgue measure. Hence, the Pr√©kopa‚ÄìLeindler inequality can also be usedGardner, Richard J. (2002). \\"The Brunn‚ÄìMinkowski inequality\\". Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. (N.S.) 39 (3): pp. 355‚Äì405 (electronic). doi:10.1090/S0273-0979-02-00941-2. . to prove the Brunn‚ÄìMinkowski inequality in its more familiar form: if 0 < Œª < 1 and A and B are non-empty, bounded, measurable subsets of Rn such that (1 ‚àí Œª)A + ŒªB is also measurable, then :\\\\mu \\\\left( (1 - \\\\lambda) A + \\\\lambda B \\\\right)^{1 / n} \\\\geq (1 - \\\\lambda) \\\\mu (A)^{1 / n} + \\\\lambda \\\\mu (B)^{1 / n}. Applications in probability and statistics =Log-concave distributions= The Pr√©kopa‚ÄìLeindler inequality is useful in the theory of log-concave distributions, as it can be used to show that log-concavity is preserved by marginalization and independent summation of log-concave distributed random variables. Suppose that H(x,y) is a log-concave distribution for (x,y) ‚àà Rm √ó Rn, so that by definition we have and let M(y) denote the marginal distribution obtained by integrating over x: :M(y) = \\\\int_{\\\\mathbb{R}^m} H(x,y) \\\\, dx. Let y1, y2 ‚àà Rn and 0 < Œª < 1 be given. Then equation () satisfies condition () with h(x) = H(x,(1 ‚àí Œª)y1 \\\\+ Œªy2), f(x) = H(x,y1) and g(x) = H(x,y2), so the Pr√©kopa‚ÄìLeindler inequality applies. It can be written in terms of M as :M((1-\\\\lambda) y_1 + \\\\lambda y_2) \\\\geq M(y_1)^{1-\\\\lambda} M(y_2)^\\\\lambda, which is the definition of log-concavity for M. To see how this implies the preservation of log-convexity by independent sums, suppose that X and Y are independent random variables with log-concave distribution. Since the product of two log-concave functions is log-concave, the joint distribution of (X,Y) is also log-concave. Log-concavity is preserved by affine changes of coordinates, so the distribution of (X + Y, X ‚àí Y) is log- concave as well. Since the distribution of X+Y is a marginal over the joint distribution of (X + Y, X ‚àí Y), we conclude that X + Y has a log-concave distribution. =Applications to Concentration of Measure= The Pr√©kopa‚ÄìLeindler inequality can be used to prove results about concentration of measure. Theorem Let A \\\\subseteq \\\\mathbb{R}^n , and set A_{\\\\epsilon} = \\\\\\\\{ x : d(x,A) < \\\\epsilon \\\\\\\\} . Let \\\\gamma(x) denote the standard Gaussian pdf, and \\\\mu it's associated measure. Then \\\\mu(A_{\\\\epsilon}) \\\\geq 1 - \\\\frac{ e^{ - \\\\epsilon^2/4}}{\\\\mu(A)} . The proof of this theorem goes by way of the following lemma: Lemma In the notation of the theorem, \\\\int_{\\\\mathbb{R}^n} \\\\exp ( d(x,A)^2/4) d\\\\mu \\\\leq 1/\\\\mu(A) . This lemma can be proven from Pr√©kopa‚ÄìLeindler by taking h(x) = \\\\gamma(x), f(x) = e^{ \\\\frac{ d(x,A)^2}{4}} \\\\gamma(x), g(x) = 1_A(x) \\\\gamma(x) and \\\\lambda = 1/2 . To verify the hypothesis of the inequality, h( \\\\frac{ x + y}{2} ) \\\\geq \\\\sqrt{ f(x) g(u)} , note that we only need to consider y \\\\in A , in which case d(x,A) \\\\leq x - y . This allows us to calculate: : (2 \\\\pi)^n f(x) g(x) = \\\\exp( \\\\frac{ d(x,A) }{4} - x^2/2 - y^2/2 ) \\\\leq \\\\exp( \\\\frac{ x - y^2 }{4} - x^2/2 - y^2/2 ) = \\\\exp ( - \\\\frac{x + y}{2}^2 ) = (2 \\\\pi)^n h( \\\\frac{ x + y}{2})^2. Since \\\\int h(x) dx = 1 , the PL-inequality immediately gives the lemma. To conclude the concentration inequality from the lemma, note that on \\\\mathbb{R}^n \\\\setminus A_{\\\\epsilon} , d(x,A) > \\\\epsilon , so we have \\\\int_{\\\\mathbb{R}^n} \\\\exp ( d(x,A)^2/4) d\\\\mu \\\\geq ( 1 - \\\\mu(A_{\\\\epsilon})) \\\\exp ( \\\\epsilon^2/4) . Applying the lemma and rearranging proves the result.

The film analyzes the life and background of Jackie Chan. Overview The world knows him as Jackie Chan. His Chinese fans know him by the stage name Sing Lung. The official record gives his birth name as Chan Kong Sang. But two years ago Jackie Chan found out from his father that his ‚Äòreal‚Äô name is Fong Si Lung/Fang Shilong. This revelation came with the uncovering of a previously hidden family history, a chronicle of lives scarred by war, poverty and separation. Jackie Chan was born in Hong Kong on 7 April 1954. His father Chan Chi-Ping worked at the US Consulate. Mr Chan had met his wife-to-be Lily in China, years before, amid the turmoil of the Japanese invasion and the chaos of the civil war between Nationalists and Communists. Chan Chi-Ping (at that time going by his real name Fang Daolong) first became an economic migrant in the 1930s, moving from his native province Shandong to the more prosperous areas along the Yangtze River. Mr Fang met his first wife in Anhui and married her in Wuhu; they had two sons, Shide and Shishen. But his wife fell ill with cancer when their elder son was only seven. She died in 1947. Mr Fang had already worked in many jobs (apprentice draper, river trader, and strong-arm man for the Nationalists‚Äô Intelligence Bureau); he made his way to Shanghai and headed the underworld ‚ÄòShandong Gang‚Äô until the city fell to the Communists in 1949. Jackie was an exuberant and well-liked boy who didn't enjoy school but at the age of seven found his niche in a Peking Opera Academy run by Master Yu. His father pledged him to a ten-year apprenticeship with Master Yu, learning acrobatic stagecraft and other performing skills. His classmates included his lifetime friends and future collaborators Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao; all three of them were members of the academy's performing troupe, the Seven Little Fortunes. Jackie's career did not take off at first, and the endless succession of bit parts and stunt jobs led him to consider emigrating to Australia to rejoin his parents. But Canberra offered only work on construction sites and in kitchens, and in 1976 he responded enthusiastically to the offer of a contract with the newly founded Lo Wei Film Company in Hong Kong, which starred him in a series of low-budget martial arts adventures. He then became a local superstar in two movies directed by the now-legendary Yuen Woo-Ping, Snake in the Eagle's Shadow and Drunken Master, both made in 1978. Meanwhile, his parents in Australia were taking advantage of China's stabilising political situation to set about tracing the long-lost children they had been forced to leave behind when they fled to Hong Kong. Lily found her daughters with no great difficulty, and Guilan emigrated to Australia to look after her mother when she fell ill. Chan Chi-Long eventually traced his two sons with the help of the Chinese Ambassador to Australia (a fellow native of Shandong), and had a reunion with them in Guangzhou in 1985. Both had suffered victimisation in Mao's Cultural Revolution of the mid-1960s, and both were having difficulty in adjusting to life in the era of Deng Xiaoping's economic reforms. Eventually, in the late 1990s, Chan Chi-Long was able to convene a gathering in Anhui of his extended family. He revised and restored the Fang family register, proudly adding the name of his Hong Kong-born son Jackie: Fang Shilong. Production notes Director Mabel Cheung (Yuen-Ting Cheung) recalled in January 2003: > One day, back in 1999, Jackie Chan heard from his father that he was at last > ready to tell him some family secrets ‚Äì to clarify the mysteries which had > been preoccupying Jackie for some time. Jackie was well aware of all the > rumours surrounding his origins and background: that he was not in fact the > biological child of his parents, that he had elder siblings in China, even > that his real surname was not ‚ÄòChan‚Äô.

It sells health insurance plans under the Blue Cross license in Washington state except Clark County and under both of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield licenses in Alaska. The company provides health insurance and related services to approximately 2 million people. Premera Blue Cross has operated in Washington since 1945, and in Alaska since 1957. Premera Blue Cross is an independent licensee of the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association. History Premera was founded as Washington Hospital Service in 1945, and began operating in Alaska in 1957. In 1969, the company's name was changed to Blue Cross of Washington and Alaska. In June 1998, Blue Cross of Washington and Alaska merged with Spokane's Medical Service Corporation under the name Premera Blue Cross. In 2002, Premera's executives first informed Washington commissioner Mike Kreidler of their intent to convert from a non-profit to a for-profit joint- stock company. After five years, the request was officially ended on March 5, 2007. In October 2009, Premera waived deductible or co-pay for 2009-H1N1 vaccine fees for its fully insured members. On February 9, 2012 the Seattle Times published an article alleging non-profit insurance outfits, including Regence, Premera and Group Health, were stockpiling billions of dollars in reserves while increasing their rates at the same time. In October 2014, Jeff Roe replaced Gubby Barlow as CEO of Premera. On May 5, 2015, Premera experienced a security breach, possibly leaking the private information of 11 million of its members. On July 11, 2019, Premera reached a settlement to pay $10.4 million over its failure to secure sensitive consumer data following the breach in 2015. In 2019, the company's board, according to the NAIC Quarterly Statement, included Connie Renee Collingsworth, a member of the leadership team of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and John E. Jenrette, an executive at Cedars-Sinai. In response to the COVID-19 crisis in 2020, Premera offered advance payments to health care providers amounting up to $100 million.

Plot =Prologue= Allison and Cheryl are two college students in a new class, \\"The Psychology of Fear.\\" It is taught by a strange professor named Edward Derek. One of Derek's in-class experiments involving a revolver makes jock Russ urinate in his pants, humiliating him. This leads to the censuring of the class by the university. to which Professor Derek responds by inviting his students to his home for a private lesson. Allison reluctantly attends with Cheryl. There, he tells the students three tales centered on fear. =The Old Dark House= Couple Joan and Kevin are celebrating Kevin's birthday. After a dinner, Joan suggests they drive on an old highway along the coastline. A tire blows out, leaving the couple stranded, and Kevin notices tacks lying across the road. Joan suggests asking for a phone at a dilapidated mansion nearby, much to Kevin's reluctance. Once inside, the couple become separated, and Kevin finds a room with human skulls arranged on a table. In a parlor, he is confronted by Joan, who dons a mask on the back of her head, and brandishes shears, before the doors close. Unbeknownst to him, Joan and all of the couple's friends are waiting in the room‚Äîthe entire event was orchestrated as a prank followed by a surprise party.

After, they get lost in a seedy industrial section of town. Realizing they are out of gas, they stop at an apparently empty station. Jennifer and Lisa enter the station garage, where they are confronted by a perverted attendant and his band of violent dogs. He holds both girls at knifepoint. When the two fail to return, Kelly and Amy investigate. Kelly manages to knock the man unconscious, but he leaps onto the roof of the convertible. They begin driving down the street while the man stabs through the convertible top, but eventually crash, killing him. They are only momentarily safe, however, as his dogs begin running toward the vehicle. Amy exits the car on foot, but is killed by the dogs. The car runs out of gas, and the three others are pursued on foot in an alleyway. They manage to trail the dogs into a chemical warehouse, where they trigger an explosion, killing all the dogs. =All Night Operator= Alex, an employee at a telephone messaging service, returns to work after breaking her leg during a ski trip. During the night shift, Alex receives numerous calls from an unhinged man, Richard, who is obsessively attempting to reach Vanessa Birch, one of the company's clients. When Alex relays the message to Vanessa, Vanessa informs her she is being stalked by Richard. Richard calls again, and Alex denies having spoken with Vanessa. When Alex calls Vanessa's home again to inform her of Richard's second call, she is met by Richard on the phone‚Äîhe has broken into the home and killed Vanessa. When Alex phones her boss, Molly, she agrees to come to the call center, but she is killed in the elevator by Richard.

They are located off the shoreline of Cannero Riviera while administratively forming part of the Comune of Cannobio. They are known as castelli, or castles, in recognition of the ruined ancient fortifications which are found on two of them. They are all that remains of the Rocca Vitaliana fortress built between 1519 and 1521 by Ludovico Borromeo, who gave it this name in honour of an illustrious ancestor. The fortress was built over the ruins of an earlier castle, the Castello della Malpaga, which had been used since the 15th century as a refuge by the powerful, cruel Mazzarditi family. These five brothers took control of the burgh of Cannobio between 1403 and 1404, terrorizing the inhabitants of the district with their acts of violence and piracy. This went on until the Viscontis laid siege to the fortress, starving the bandits into surrender. The old castle was razed to the ground, so that no trace of it remains. The Rocca Vitaliana was then built to defend the upper part of Lake Maggiore from incursions by the Swiss after the Duchy of Milan lost control of the Canton of Ticino. The main part of the castle, on the eastern islet, still has its massive walls built right on the water, following the irregular contours of the rock, and some towers of different shapes which still have part of their battlements. All that remains of the castle on the western islet is a ruined tower and some crumbling parts of the wall. The ruins cannot be visited as they are unsafe, but the view of them from the shore or from a boat continues to be compelling. The islands‚Äô rocky shores are a magnet for adventurous bathers.

The series chronicled the family court cases heard by Judge Robert J. Franklin, played by Bob Shield. In contrast to The People's Court, which featured actual litigants, The Judge, along with Divorce Court and Superior Court, was one of several popular shows of the day that featured dramatizations of actual court cases. The Judge was produced and licensed by WBNS-TV in Columbus, Ohio, and was distributed by Genesis Entertainment. Show format =Opening= After a preview of the day's episode (which sometimes showed a pre-hearing teaser), the show would begin at Judge Franklin's home with Franklin preparing for work (Photographs in the background, all actually of Shield himself, showed Franklin's days in the Army and as a young lawyer). After a kiss to his wife and a wave to their neighbors, Judge Franklin would drive off to work as we heard him narrate: The opening would end with him entering his chambers, sitting down, and signing some documents; concluding with a close-up of his signature. (The building that stood in for the courthouse is City Hall for the city of Pasadena, California). Like the aforementioned courtroom dramas, episodes of The Judge involved shock value; cases that began as mundane or routine often ended up taking a serious or unexpected turn. Other regular characters *(Miss) Janet Page (J.T. Solomon), Judge Franklin's courtroom assistant. *Sergeant Terrance Fox (Brendan Burns), A recurring character who was often used for comic relief. An honest police officer with an abrasive personality, Fox would often irritate Judge Franklin to no end; in one episode he told the officer that he would try the patience of a saint, adding, \\"And I am no saint!\\" Broadcast history A drama that later became The Judge, called Municipal Court (changed to The Judge while still a local program), ran for 12 years as a local television program in Columbus, Ohio. Shield, playing Judge Franklin, won four regional Emmy Awards for his performance. In 1986, The Judge was picked up for national syndication, where it enjoyed a seven- year run. Repeats of The Judge aired on the USA Network in the early 1990s. The nationally syndicated version was originally taped in Los Angeles for its first four runs of 10 episodes each (1986‚Äì89), and later moved to Toronto, Ontario, Canada for its final three runs (1990‚Äì93). The show was licensed by WBNS-TV in Columbus.

A train returning to Paris derailed at Meudon after the leading locomotive broke an axle, and the carriages behind piled into it and caught fire. It was the first French railway accident and the deadliest in the world at the time, causing between 52 and 200 deaths, including that of explorer Jules Dumont d'Urville and his wife Ad√®le Dumont D'Urville. The accident led the French to abandon the practice of locking passengers in their carriages. Metal fatigue cracking was poorly understood at the time and the accident led to systematic research into the problem. Derailment and fire A painting of the accident By the late afternoon of Sunday 8 May 1842, the public celebrations being held in honour of king Louis Philippe I's saint's day in the Gardens of Versailles had finished and many people wished to return to Paris. At 5:30 pm a train left the rive gauche Versailles railway station for Paris Montparnasse. Available online at catskillarchive.com The Versailles Accident. Accessed 26 October 2012. Over long and composed of 16 to 18 carriages hauled by two steam locomotives, the train was crowded, carrying 770 passengers. Travelling at between Bellevue and Meudon, one of the axles of the leading locomotive snapped and the vehicle derailed, scattering the contents of its fire-box. When the second locomotive and the carriages continued over the derailed locomotive, the carriages caught fire, trapping the passengers. The passengers were locked in their compartments as was the custom in continental Europe at the time. The fire was so intense that the number of fatalities could not be determined, with estimates varying between 52 and 200, and hundreds of people were seriously injured. Among the deaths was the explorer Jules Dumont d'Urville and his family; his remains were identified by a sculptor from a cast he had made of the skull. Some religious groups claimed that the passengers had been punished for travelling on a Sunday. A chapel named \\"Notre-Dame-des-Flammes\\" (English: Our Lady of the Flames) was built in Meudon in memory of the victims; this was listed as a Monument historique in 1938, but delisted in 1959 and demolished soon after. Legacy This was the worst rail disaster in the world at the time. The accident led to the abandonment of the practice of locking passengers in their carriages in France. The French government appointed a commission to investigate the accident; this recommended testing axles to determine their service life and monitoring their usage so that they could be replaced after travelling a safe distance. Metal fatigue was poorly understood at the time and the accident is linked to the beginnings of systematic research into the problem. Work by Edwards, William Rankine, William Fairbairn and others described the fatigue process and Rankine developed a solution for railway axles. Later, during 1856 to 1870, the work of August W√∂hler would help to improve testing of axles, and so increase axle life.

After serving as Rav of the Young Israel of Greater Miami, Florida, for nine years, he and his family moved to Moshav Matityahu, Israel, in 1983, where he is the mora d'asra (rabbinic communal leader). He is a popular teacher for American Haredi students and adults in Israel. Early life and education Zev Leff was born in Bronx, New York, to a traditional Jewish family.Frankfurter, Rabbi Yitzchok. \\"Leading the Field\\". Ami, December 5, 2018, pp. 68-81. His parents and grandparents were all American-born, while his great-grandparents were religious. He attended public school and an Orthodox Talmud Torah in the afternoons. After his family moved to North Miami Beach, Florida, he attended a Conservative Hebrew school run by religious teachers, who convinced him to transfer to a yeshiva. He was accepted at the Hebrew Academy of Greater Miami and subsequently attended the Mesivta of Greater Miami. At age 17 he progressed to the Telshe yeshiva in Cleveland, Ohio, where he received his rabbinic ordination and became a close talmid (student) of Rabbi Mordechai Gifter. In 1968, he married Rivkah Minkoff of Ellenville, New York. The couple settled in Cleveland, where Leff studied in the Telshe kollel for the next six years. He also taught in the Yavneh girls' high school and seminary. Rabbinic career  In 1974, Leff was appointed Rav of the Young Israel of Greater Miami, located in North Miami Beach, Florida. At the time, the congregation consisted of about 150 families, of whom 90 percent were Sabbath-observant. By the time he left nine years later, the congregation numbered 300 families. In 1983, Leff and his family decided to make aliyah to Israel, where he became the Rav and mora d'asra (rabbinic communal leader) of Moshav Matityahu, a small settlement now adjacent to Modi'in Illit (Kiryat Sefer). At the time, the moshav was home to 11 families. Leff characterized the residents of Matityahu as \\"American chareidi, people who had a tremendous love for Eretz Yisrael. We were very pro-Eretz Yisrael and not against the medinah [state], but we also didn't say Hallel on Yom Haatzma'ut\\". As of 2018, the moshav is home to approximately 150 families, of whom 30 to 40 percent are Israeli. Leff also serves as dean of the moshav's kollel. From 2006 to 2016, he headed the moshav's yeshiva gedola, which was geared to American-born students. In addition to his communal duties, Leff teaches in several girls' seminaries in Jerusalem. He is a faculty member of Darchei Binah Women's School for Advanced Torah StudiesDarchei Binah Faculty and Staff. and the Jewish Learning Exchange of London. He also teaches at Seminar Yerushalayim, Neve Yerushalayim's Midreshet Tehillah, Michlala Women's College, and Bnot Torah; he formerly taught at the EYAHT College for Jewish Women. He teaches \\"practical rabbinics\\" for the Ohr Lagolah Institute (based in Ohr Somayach, Jerusalem). He delivers a twice-monthly shiur to a group of English-speakers in Netanya. Leff has been a featured speaker at the conventions of the Orthodox Union, Agudath Israel of America, Torah Umesorah, and the Association for Jewish Outreach Programs. He is a rabbinic consultant for the Refuah Institute and Baruch Rofeh Cholim. Soccer game coverage In November 2018, a Sky News video of Leff engrossed in a sefer at a Scotland‚ÄìIsrael UEFA Nations League soccer game, oblivious to the excitement in the stadium after Israel scored its first goal, went viral. Leff and his wife had been visiting their daughter and son-in-law, the latter a UK Rabbanut chaplain for all the universities in Glasgow, and accompanied the entire community to dinner and the game. As he personally had no interest in the match, Leff brought his Talmud Yerushalmi along to study the Daf Yomi. The sight of the rabbi studying his sefer during the game generated jokes and memes across social media platforms. Opinions In The Jewish Press \\"Is It Proper\\" series on the topic of the loudness of music played at religious weddings, Leff remarked, \\"Music (even music with lyrics that are based on verses from Tanach or tefillah) whose beat, tempo, or volume creates a mood of wild abandon (hefkerus), or could accompany primitive natives dancing around a cauldron cooking a human being, is not kosher irrespective of who composed it or is playing it ‚Äì be they non-Jews or religious Jews\\".

The study was set up on 13 June 1979 by the Parliament of Victoria, and the report was published on 26 September 1980. Murray Lonie, a retired executive of General Motors and BHP, was appointed to head the study and the secretary was the head of the Country Roads Board, Robin Underwood. Scope and aims In the words of the authors the Lonie Report aimed to: > institute a study into all freight and passenger transport within Victoria, > and to and from Victoria, in order to produce a co-ordinated transport > system capable of meeting the needs of all residents of Victoria, having > particular regard to the effect of transport on the balanced development of > the State. To some extent, the Lonie Report followed on from the Bland Report, a 1972 inquiry into land transport in Victoria by Sir Henry Bland, but was extended to cover a much greater number of topics, including, but not limited to, ports and air transportation. There were special sections for the transport of certain important commodities, including cement and grain. Study and recommendations Between June and December 1979, 41 individuals, 21 government agencies and 28 of the (then) 211 Victorian local government areas wrote submissions to the study, as did a large number of lobby groups representing various positions on the question of transport planning. The writing of the report was done between December 1979 until its final publication in September 1980. It was presented to Transport Minister Rob Maclellan, and was released as a total of twenty-five volumes and a final report, containing recommendations on every topic covered. The Lonie Report argued that, despite the immense change in demand for various modes of transportation since the beginning of the twentieth century, the transport system was still run by the same methods as prevailed in the nineteenth century. It argued for large-scale deregulation of transport markets, especially by the removal of the current restrictions on the carriage by road of such goods as cement, sawn timber, fertilisers and grain. The report was particularly concerned about the operating losses made by VicRail due to significant declines in patronage and large increases in car ownership. The report fundamentally argued that it would be much too expensive to upgrade the rail system to be competitive with the car, or even with buses, and that therefore: * all country passenger rail services, except from Melbourne to Geelong, should be replaced by buses * trains on the suburban Port Melbourne, St. Kilda, Altona, Williamstown, Alamein, Upfield and Sandringham lines should be replaced by buses, as should the Hurstbridge line beyond Eltham. * trams from the city to South Melbourne Beach, South Melbourne and St Kilda Beach, Camberwell and West Maribyrnong, Kew/Cotham Road to St Kilda Beach, North Richmond to Prahran (and by default North Richmond to St Kilda Beach) and Footscray to Moonee Ponds should be replaced by buses * all night-time and weekend rail services be replaced by buses or multi-hire taxis * fares should be increased more frequently to eliminate public subsidies as soon as possible * already-closed rural freight lines should remain closed and be dismantled to recycle the sleepers and steel * small-volume freight should be shifted from rail to road * a multi-modal public transport fare system be developed * a system of multi-hire taxis be instituted to provide public transport in new suburbs The report stated that because of increasing demand, Victoria's major highways should be duplicated. It also argued for the reservation of land to allow the construction of road bypasses around major towns on these highways. Within Melbourne, it argued for extensions to the Eastern and South Eastern Freeways, for the linking of the West Gate Freeway to Port Melbourne, and for the building of a ring road around the city, claiming that those increases in road capacity were needed to meet predicted demand for road transport. It also advocated a road bypass of Lilydale on the Maroondah Highway, and argued for the introduction of clearways on main suburban streets to speed up road traffic. Another recommendation of the report was the staggering of school and work hours in order to spread out the demand on public transport services, which it said would reduce the overcrowding on those services during peak periods, and the number of under-used services at other times. The report argued that be done through employers being encouraged by government to develop more flexible hours. Influence The release of the Lonie Report by the government of Rupert Hamer led immediately to severe criticism, particularly from large numbers of people who used the rail services that the report recommended eliminating. As a result of public protests in the last three months of 1980, the Hamer Government was forced to reject a number of the report's recommendations. All tram services were retained, and the $115 million 'New Deal' for Country Passengers, a plan for the reorganisation and revitalisation of country passenger rail services, was unveiled in February 1981. Only the following country passenger rail lines were closed: * Lilydale - Healesville: 1 March 1981 * Donald to Ballarat: March 1981 * Toolamba to Echuca: 2 March 1981 * Numurkah - Cobram: 27 April 1981 * Baxter - Mornington: 20 May 1981 * Dandenong - Leongatha - Yarram: 6 June 1981 * Frankston - Stony Point: June 1981 * Portland to Ararat: 12 September 1981 Some of those lines remained open for freight. Cobram, Stony Point and Leongatha passenger services were reinstated by the incoming Labor government, and the Baxter to Mornington line became a heritage railway. The Cobram and Leongatha passenger services were shut down again by the Kennett Government. The Hamer Government's plans to close several suburban rail lines were halted because of continuing protests. However, late night services on the Upfield Line were eliminated (they were restored in 1997) and a multimodal fare system was introduced that - unpredicted by the Report - boosted patronage to such an extent that historians believe it has been responsible for the survival of the system. Despite those changes, the Lonie Report proved very influential in transport planning, especially after the election of Jeff Kennett as premier. Indeed, the report could be seen as providing the basis for the \\"Linking Melbourne\\" project carried out during Kennett's seven years as Premier, and also for the elimination of the large number of regulatory mechanisms that governed transport in Victoria before the 1980s, which culminated in the privatisation of public transport in the 1990s. Some of the report's recommendations were carried out before Kennett became Premier, such as the linking of the South Eastern Freeway to the Mulgrave Freeway. Criticism The Lonie Report has been severely criticised ever since it was first released. Professional transport planners have generally believed that it only considered direct financial cost in making its recommendations. It has also been criticised for not fully considering how building additional road capacity affects people's decisions about whether to use private or public transport, creating induced demand for even more major road construction, thereby negating any benefit from building the road in the first place. The Public Transport Users Association argued that the report did not consider that further public transport service reductions would cause a vicious circle of greater declines in patronage, poorer cost recovery and even larger deficits. The fact that the Lonie Report was written by people with a vested interest in increasing road transport has also led many professional planners at universities to question its assumptions and conclusions. The 1991 Russell Report, written by transport academic Bill Russell, claimed that the benefits of freeway building, which had been propagated by governments before and since the Lonie Report, were overstated. Indeed, the Lonie Report could be seen as evidence for the relatively recent claims by academic Guy Pearse that car, mineral and fossil fuel lobby groups have long written government policy on energy and transport in Australia (see Greenhouse Mafia). Perhaps more potent than criticisms based upon supposed involvement of vested interests, the Lonie Report had, as an underlying assumption, falling levels of public transport patronage; it failed completely to foresee Melbourne's rapid population growth, due to immigration, and increasing population density. The Lonie Report noted the rapidly increasing levels of government subsidy to public transport. According to the report, at the time, cost recovery through fares was 53% for the MMTB and 49% for Vic Rail, both of which would be considered high rates of cost recovery now. Increasing subsidy levels are a trend that has continued in more recent years, albeit one apparently acceptable to government as a means to encourage people to shift to public transport. The Lonie Report seems to have been predicated upon a view that high levels of subsidy would be unacceptable to government and voters alike, which has not proven to be the case.

Raised in Maine to be a sea captain, Loring instead became a civic leader in Minneapolis, Minnesota where he was a wealthy flour miller and in Riverside, California where he helped to build the first city hall. He was a popular and generous man who enjoyed many friendships and business associations. Loring is remembered as the influential commissioner and president of the first Minneapolis park board. Considered the \\"Father of the Park System\\" in Minneapolis, Loring encouraged the city to work with Horace Cleveland, one of the first landscape architects, and park superintendents William W. Berry and Theodore Wirth. The city built what has been called, \\"the best-located, best-financed, best-designed, and best- maintained public open space in America.\\" Family and early life Loring's grandfather was a respected teacher in Portland, Maine known as Master Loring, a descendant of one of the earliest settlers of Hingham, Massachusetts. Suffolk Deeds, Liber X, Municipal Printing Office, William Blake Trask (ed.), Boston, 1899 Charles himself was a fifth great grandson of Hingham immigrant Deacon Thomas Loring.Charles Henry Pope, Loring Genealogy, (1917), p.321 His mother was Sarah Wiley, a relative of Parson Wiley, a noted clergyman. His father Captain Horace Loring, a seaman who once visited the West Indies, took the young Loring on voyages as far from home as Cuba to prepare him for a life as a sea captain. But Loring disliked the ocean and the isolation and moved to Chicago in 1856 where he worked as a wheat speculator for B. P. Hutchinson and became a successful grain trader. Loring never enjoyed perfect health, and when he fell ill in Chicago and moved on doctor's advice to Minneapolis, his friend Loren Fletcher helped him become manager of the supply store for Dorilus Morrison's lumber business. Loring and Emily S. Crosman married in 1855. They had one daughter, Eva Maria, and one son, Albert C. Loring who managed businesses for his father. Emily Loring died on March 13, 1894. Loring remarried on November 28, 1895 to Florence Barton, daughter of A. B. Barton of Minneapolis. Florence Loring participated in civic affairs and was a quilter whose Crazy Quilt is in the collection of the Minneapolis Institute of Arts. The Lorings constructed the Florence Barton Loring Shelter in 1906 to protect children, lost animals and the city's draft horses. Known at different times as the Minneapolis Humane Society, the Animal Rescue League, and the Animal Humane Society of Hennepin County, today's Animal Humane Society (AHS) was located there near Loring Park for 40 years. Florence Loring also built a home for nurses near the hospital in Riverside, California where the Lorings lived in winter. Flour milling Flour leaving the Holly Mill, 1870s Minneapolis was founded at Saint Anthony Falls, the only waterfall on the Mississippi River, because of the potential for energy created by falling, flowing water. Loring understood the city's geography‚Äîits waterfalls, lakes and river banks‚Äîand was able to use these unique aspects of his new home to slowly build his fortune. The Galaxy Mill was rebuilt after the Washburn \\"A\\" Mill explosion in 1878. In 1861, Loring joined Fletcher in L. Fletcher & Co., a general store specializing in supplies for lumbermen on Nicollet Avenue across from Minneapolis City Hall where they prospered for fifteen years. They joined with W. F. Cahill to convert the municipal waterworks building into a flour mill run on hydropower, the smallest in the Mississippi west bank milling district. With George Hineline they added three limestone stories and operated it as the W. F. Cahill & Co. Holly mill. During this period, Loring served in the city government, first as road supervisor and in 1872 as a Minneapolis City Council member from the Fifth Ward in the Near North community. The group sold the Holly mill in 1872 to W. H. and F. S. Hinkle and purchased the Galaxy mill from W. P. Ankeny. In 1873 Fletcher and Loring also became principal owners of the Minnetonka Mills Company near Lake Minnetonka, in production between 1881 and 1886. Loring supervised his milling interests until 1880, when his son A. C. Loring took responsibility for their management. The Northwestern Consolidated Milling Company led by John Martin purchased the Galaxy mill and beginning in 1891 operated nine mills in Minneapolis. By the early 1900s and until the Great Depression, Washburn-Crosby which became General Mills, Pillsbury-Washburn, and Northwestern which became part of Standard Milling Company were an oligopoly, holding 97% of the Minneapolis flour market. Electricity and rail Soo Line is part of the Canadian Pacific Railway. Through his business associations, Loring contributed to major advances in the infrastructure of Minneapolis, to supply electricity, as a director of a railroad, and as chief executive of the North American Telegraph Company. In 1881 with William D. Washburn, Joel Bean Bassett, Sumner W. Farnham, James A. Lovejoy and Otis Arkwright Pray, Fletcher and Loring co-founded the Minnesota Electric Light and Electric Motive Power Company, later the Minnesota Brush Electric Company. The group ran lines to bars and businesses on Washington Avenue and supplied them from the first hydroelectric central power plant in the U.S., thirteen years before the Niagara Falls plant went on line in 1894. In 1883 with Washburn, Martin, H. T. Welles, Thomas Lowry, George R. Newell, Anthony Kelly, Clinton Morrison, J. K. Sidle, W. W. Eastman, William D. Hale, Charles A. Pillsbury and Charles J. Martin, Loring incorporated the Minneapolis Sault Ste. Marie & Atlantic Railway Company known as the Soo Line Railroad. Other associations Minneapolis Grain Exchange Loring also owned real estate and was a director of Syndicate Insurance Co., the Minnesota Title Insurance Co. and the Minnesota Loan and Trust Co. which eventually became part of today's Wells Fargo. The first Minnesota Flower Show was held July 4, 1863 and was organized by Loring who was a member of the Minnesota Horticultural Society. He co-founded the Minnesota Hom≈ìopathic Medical College which opened in 1886. Loring acted as president of the Minneapolis Board of Trade in 1875 and from 1886 to 1890 served as president of the Minneapolis Chamber of Commerce, renamed the Minneapolis Grain Exchange. Loring cofounded the Morgan Machine Co. in Rochester, New York. He served as president of the Minnesota Forestry Association, the National Park and Outdoor Association, the Lakewood Cemetery Association, and the Sons of Maine and as vice president of the National Board of Trade. Park board Despite opposition from the Knights of Labor who eventually became supporters, on January 23, 1883 the Minneapolis Board of Trade passed resolutions to secure legislation to create a Board of Park Commissioners, and the city ratified a Park Act on April 3, 1883. Loring was the natural choice and was appointed the commission's first president. He was reelected each term and served until 1890 when he insisted on resigning because a property in which he held financial interest was under park board consideration. =Horace Cleveland= Horace Cleveland Horace Cleveland made his \\"crowning achievement\\" in Minneapolis at the end of his career, in part thanks to \\"kindred spirits.\\" William Watts Folwell who was the founding president of the University of Minnesota, and Berry and Loring, both from Maine, were all united in their love for nature. The system Cleveland created is characterized by the use of indigenous plants in their natural environment and by the linking of open spaces and landmarks across distance with boulevards and parkways. Cleveland had thought about linked public open spaces as early as 1855. During Loring's tenure, Cleveland designed the Grand Rounds Scenic Byway and the Chain of Lakes. In his history of the Minneapolis park system, Loring describes how green space was preserved around every Minneapolis lake. Many donations and acquisitions of property came early enough that the land was affordable. In 1872 for example, the city thought William S. King's price of $50,000 was too high for the of land around Lake Harriet. Thirty years later it would have sold for $2,000,000. =Minnehaha Park= Loring called the around Minnehaha Falls the park board's most important acquisition. Minnehaha Falls received pilgrimages from fans of Longfellow's The Song of Hiawatha by the 1870s. At the same time, business people wanted to harness its power. In 1884 Loring advocated a Minnesota state park at Minnehaha Falls, a goal the state tried and failed to achieve. In 1888, Cleveland presented The Aesthetic Development of the United Cities of St. Paul and Minneapolis at the Minneapolis Society of Fine Arts and convinced the city to preserve the waterfall and to build a city park there. In the 1890s, Cleveland's Minnehaha Park was annexed to Minneapolis and completed the Grand Rounds. Today Minnehaha Park sees 850,000 visitors each year. Named by Folwell, the 52-mile (83 km) Grand Rounds circles from Northeast, Minneapolis to Theodore Wirth Park, to the Chain of Lakes and follows the Mississippi River upstream past Minnehaha Falls to downtown. =Theodore Wirth= At the 1889 meeting of the American Park and Outdoor Art Association, held in Minneapolis, Loring read Cleveland's The Influence of Parks on the Character of Children. In 1905 Loring learned of Theodore Wirth and recruited him as park superintendent. Wirth met with Minneapolis neighborhoods to extend Cleveland's work from landmark geographical features to every street. He wrapped \\"sixty miles of picturesque parkways around the City like an emerald ribbon.\\" Wirth planned a playground within the reach of most children and canopies of trees throughout the city. Each home is within six blocks of a park and as of the U.S. Census in 2000, there are of parkland for each resident. Minneapolis park assets as of 2004 included the following. 144 of the parks were in place when Wirth retired in 1935. Mount Rubidoux was dedicated in 1922. { - valign=\\"top\\"  { * 170 parks * 17 lakes (24 in city) * 12 gardens * 3 outdoor pools * 62 wading pools }  { * 49 recreation centers * 10 supervised beaches * 2 waterparks * 7 golf courses * 34 skating rinks }  { * of parkway * of bicycle trails * of walking trails * 4 dog parks * 183 tennis courts } } City of Riverside In 1889 in his winter home in Riverside, California, Loring constructed an office block with a 1,000-seat theater on the first floor that hosted performers such as W.C. Fields and Sarah Bernhardt. At various times known as the Loring Opera House, Loring Theatre, Fox Riverside, and Golden State Theatre, the theater was destroyed by fire in 1990. and The office building was leased to the city for use as its first City Hall, library, jail and municipal courts. Legacies Loring's monument in Lakewood Cemetery in Minneapolis Formerly Central Park, Loring Park in the Central community is designed by Cleveland on the site of the Joseph Johnson farm. It was dedicated May 5, 1883 and renamed for Loring in or near his final year as park board president. Loring Lake, formerly Johnson Lake, was also named for Loring as is the Loring Stage House, originally Loring's office. In California, Loring Drive in Huntington Park and Loring's building in Riverside bore his name. In Minneapolis, the Loring Elementary School in the Camden community, the Loring Nicollet Alternative School in the Stevens Square neighborhood, the Loring Pasta Bar in Dinkytown as well as other businesses carry his name. The Minneapolis Park & Recreation Board's Charles M. Loring Award is named in his memory. The Camp Fire Girls planted a spruce tree in his memory on the south shore of Lake Harriet. Loring died at his home in Minneapolis at the age of 88. He is buried in Lakewood Cemetery which he helped to create near Lake Calhoun in Minneapolis. The City of Riverside declared April 17, 1923 Loring Day and dedicated a plaque to him, inscribed with this memorial: In honor of Charles M.

First run in 1925, it was a much enlarged development of the Junkers L2, in turn a licensed development of the BMW IV. Design and development The Junkers L5 was a development of Junkers' first water-cooled engine, the L2, but at four times the swept volume was a much more powerful engine. It was a water-cooled upright inline 6-cylinder unit, four-stroke and petrol-fuelled, with a capacity of nearly 23 litres. It adopted some of the L2 features, having twin exhaust and inlet valves in each cylinderdriven by an overhead camshaft, twin spark plugs and twin magnetos. The splash component of the L2's lubrication was abandoned in favour of a completely forced recirculating system. The twin carburettors of the L2 were replaced with a single float chamber, dual-venturi model. Like the L2, the L5 was a direct drive engine. The compression ratio of the standard version was 5.5:1, but variants had other ratios to cope with fuels with octane ratings between 76 and 95. The G series introduced carburettor heating together with an hydraulically damped mounting system. There were also choices of starting system, from inertial or compressed air systems to the traditional hand swinging. Operational history The L5 proved to be reliable and became the engine of choice for most Junkers aircraft in the mid-1920s as well as powering aircraft from other German manufacturers. Many of these powered the Junkers F.13 and its derivatives like the W 33, which dominated world air transport in the mid-1920s.Kay (2004), p. 62 The best demonstration of the reliability of the L5 was given by the unit which powered the single-engined W 33 Bremen in the first fixed wing east to west crossing of the Atlantic in April 1928. For this flight the compression ratio was raised to 7:1 to provide sufficient power for the heavily fuelled aircraft at take off. In July 1925 a W 33 powered by a L5 stayed aloft for 65 h 25 min, with a fuel consumption of 35.6 kg/h. Variants *L5 many variants including a variety of compression ratios, power output levels and starting systems. *L55 an upright V-12 built from two L5s on a common crankshaft. *L8 a significant 1929 development with the same swept volume but cruising at 2,100 rpm and delivering 354 hp; take off power was 413 hp. The output was geared down at ratios between 2.47:1 and 1.44:1 to enhance propeller efficiency. Only a few were produced, powering early configurations of the Junkers G 38 as outer engines, with two L55s inboard. *L88 an upright V-12 built from two L8s on a common crankshaft.

The four founder members were composer Ruben ≈ªahra, traditional instrument maker ƒ†u≈ºi Gatt, researcher Steve Borƒ° and musician Andrew Alamango. Their main task was to present a revival of old traditional Maltese instruments, at times, with a fusion with contemporary ones. In 2000 Etnika released their first album, entitled Nafra. Their second album, ≈ªifna (Dance), was released in 2003; it depicts the sentiment of the island nation with its cross cultural Mediterranean influences. Their efforts were rewarded by the Award of Music Achievement in the 2001 Malta Music Awards, held in Ta'Qali. The beginning In 1999, researcher Steve Borƒ°, identified a collection of old Maltese melodies at King's College London. The Welshman Edward Jones, formerly the bard to the Prince of Wales, had published these melodies around 1807. Borƒ° made the melodies public through Etnika in 2000 at the official launch of an exhibition on traditional Maltese instruments. Jones, born in Bala, North Wales, reportedly collected hundreds of Welsh melodies during his walks around the principality. At the same time composer Ruben Zahra was returning to Malta following years of academic studies at the Conservatorio di Musica di Frosinone, the Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia in Rome and the Accademia Musicale Chigiana in Siena. An article written well over twenty years before about the demise of the Maltese bagpipe, the ≈ºaqq, intrigued the folklorist Guzi Gatt. In 1977 two British students, J.K. Partridge and Frank Jeal, had published their research, entitled 'The Maltese ≈ªaqq', in The Galpin Society Journal. It remains one of the most scholarly and informative works written in this instrument to date. The article described the ≈ºaqqs musical abilities, but the authors also claimed that \\"The Maltese, with few notable exceptions, show little interest in their own folk culture, and any artificial attempts at revival seem unlikely to succeed. It seems sad that an island that can boast an excellent Scots pipe band, can find no room to preserve, perhaps even develop, its own native bagpipe.\\" Gatt sought out Toni Cachia Il-ƒ¶ammarun from Naxxar, one of Malta's remaining Maltese bagpipe builders and musicians. Well into his eighties, Cachia had been playing the traditional instrument since the late 1920s. He agreed to help Gatt in his quest to save the ≈ºaqq from extinction. The Maltese traditional instruments The Etnika project also aimed at resuscitating traditional Maltese instruments that had fallen out of use and presenting these forgotten soundscapes to Maltese society, with an aim to raise national consciousness. These instruments included the flejguta (cane whistle flute), the ≈ºummara (single reed pipe), the tanbur (frame drum), the ≈ºaf≈ºava (friction drum) and the ≈ºaqq (Maltese bagpipe).allmalta.com - Maltese Falklore All were built from locally sourced materials including cane, ash, string and animal skins. 2000 Nafra Etnika gave their first public concert during the Evenings on Campus festival on 29 August 2000 at the Atriju Vassalli in the University of Malta, during which the album Nafra was released. The album has eleven instrumental tracks, three of which taken from Edward Jones's publication of circa 1807. It featured Godfrey Mifsud on clarinet, Mario Frendo on violin, David Grech on guitar, Tricia Dawn Williams on piano, Jason Fabri on drums, Joe Camilleri l-Bibi on percussion and Ruben ≈ªahra on ≈ºaqq and other traditional instruments. Amongst the most popular tracks were Ragƒßaj (Shepherd) and l-Gƒßanja tal-Mewƒ°' (Waves Song). Malta's eminent folklorist Guze Cassar Pullicino was amongst those present. In 2003, they released ≈ªifna at the Bedouin Bar in San Giljan, Malta. Andrew Alamango and Andrej Vujicic were the producers of this more acoustic album, which Jim Foley favorably reviewed in Rootsworld.Etnika - Zifna - new music from Malta / RootsWorld Recording Review oh yes z 2003 Bumbum show at Fort Saint Elmo, Valletta In July and August 2003, Etnika presented three concerts entitled Bumbum, at Fort St. Elmo Valletta under the Etnikafe concept of fusing their music with flamenco. This project also included a total of twenty musicians, including four brass musicians, three traditional musicians and two gƒßannejja folk singers, namely Frans Baldacchino il-Budaj and Toni Spiteri Tal-ƒ†ebel.

Agia Lavra (\\"Holy Lavra\\") is a monastery near Kalavryta, Achaea, Greece. It was built in 961 AD, on Chelmos Mountain, at an altitude of 961 meters, and can be described as the symbolic birthplace of modern Greece. It stands as one of the oldest monasteries in the Peloponnese. It was built in the 10th century but was burnt to the ground in 1585 by the Turks. It was rebuilt in 1600 while the frescoes by Anthimos were completed in 1645. It was burnt again in 1715 and in 1826 by the armies of Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt. In 1850 after the rebirth of modern Greece, the building was completely rebuilt. The monastery was burned down by German forces in 1943. It is famously linked with the Greek War of Independence, since it was here that the call for Eleftheria I Thanatos (ŒïŒªŒµœÖŒ∏ŒµœÅŒØŒ± ŒÆ Œ∏Œ¨ŒΩŒ±œÑŒøœÇ) was first heard on 25 March 1821, launching the revolution against the Ottoman Empire. That day, Bishop Germanos of Patras performed a doxology and administered an oath to the Peloponnesian fighters.History of the Hellenic Nation, v. 12, p. 82 The revolutionary flag was raised by Bishop under the plane tree just outside the gate of the monastery. To this day, the vestments of Germanos, documents, books, icons, the Gospel of Tsarina Catherine II of Russia, sacred vessels, crosses, etc. are preserved in the Monastery's museum, along with the holy relics of St Alexios, given by Byzantine emperor Manuel II Palaeologus in 1398. Pieces of embroidery, made with gold or silver threads woven in pure silk materials in Smyrna and Constantinople, are also possessions of the Monastery and they date from the 16th century. On the hill opposite, a monument to the heroes of the Revolution of 1821 looks down upon the monastery.

Op vrijdag aten we challe, met Pasen matzes , Jonet.nl, 20 November 2010 His father is a member of the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy and his mother a member of the Labour Party. Lodewijk Asscher 'Ik ben soms knetterhard', Intermediair.nl, 8 December 2005 Asscher went to the Christelijk Gymnasium Sorghvliet in The Hague. He studied psychology (propaedeutics in 1995) and Dutch law (master's degree in 1998) at the University of Amsterdam in Amsterdam. In 2002, he received his PhD in law from the University of Amsterdam. Dr. L.F. (Lodewijk) Asscher, Parlement & Politiek. Retrieved on 10 April 2015.  Politics  = Amsterdam = Asscher entered the municipal council after the Dutch municipal elections of 2002. Besides his role as the group leader of the Labour Party in the Amsterdam municipal council, he took part in the commission on General Affairs. Until 1 January 2006, Asscher taught information law at the University of Amsterdam. In his book \\"New Amsterdam\\", Asscher advocated the eventual disappearance of the red light district. A few days after the release of the book, Asscher revoked that statement, stating that he was not against prostitution, but rather against sexual slavery. After the Dutch municipal elections of 2006, where he led the Labour Party's campaign in Amsterdam, Asscher was installed as an alderman on 26 April. His portfolio included Economics, Airport and Harbour; he also was Deputy Mayor of Amsterdam from 2006 until 2010. He served as Acting Mayor of Amsterdam from 12 March 2010 to 7 July 2010 and then became the alderman in charge of Finances until 5 November 2012. = Netherlands = On 5 November 2012, he became Minister of Social Affairs and Employment and Deputy Prime Minister in the Second Rutte cabinet. Lodewijk Asscher wordt vicepremier, NOS, 26 October 2012. Asscher: politiek talent van de PvdA, NOS, 1 November 2012. In Amsterdam he was succeeded by Eberhard van der Laan (also PvdA). In September 2014, Asscher announced heightened scrutiny of four Dutch-Turkish organisations that he suspected of hindering integration, including a religious group, Mill√Æ G√∂r√º≈ü. This led to the expulsion of 2 Dutch Turkish MPs from the Labour Party after they harshly criticised the move. On 9 December 2016 Asscher won the leadership of the Labour Party in an election against incumbent Diederik Samsom. He obtained 54,5% of the vote. In the Dutch general election of 2017, the PvdA suffered the biggest defeat in Dutch electoral history, receiving only 5.7% of the votes and losing 29 of its 38 seats. The PvdA did not rejoin the government after the election. Asscher was succeeded as Minister of Social Affairs and Employment by Wouter Koolmees in the Third Rutte cabinet, on 26 October 2017.  Personal  Lodewijk Asscher is married to Jildau Piena, with whom he has three sons.

It is often referred to as the Japanese flatfish or Korea(n) flatfish (Í¥ëÏñ¥) when mentioned in the context of those countries. It is the highest valued finfish in the world, known to be excellent for aquaculture due to a rapid growth rate and popularity in Korea. It reaches a length of and a weight of . In 2017 its genome and transcriptome was sequenced as a model to study flatfish asymmetry.  Habitat and Diet  The olive flounder is often found in soft and muddy offshore, coastal areas where the water level goes down to 100m in depth. The temperature of water in these areas range from 21- 24 ¬∞C or 69 -75 ¬∞F. Some flounder have been found in the Mariana's Trench. Olive flounder typically eat fish spawn, crustaceans, polychaetes, and small fish.  Life cycle  Olive flounder spawn anytime from January through August in shallow water, roughly about 70 cm in depth. The egg and larvae remain that way for about 24-50 days after hatching. Once they begin their metamorphosis process, they more towards more sandy areas and feed on shrimp. After achieving metamorphosis, the flounder move offshore and begin feeding on bigger fish in order to grow to their adult size.  How they become \\"flatfish\\"  Olive flounder first start out upright like normal fish, but then after 24 to 50 days after hatching they turn onto their side.Their previous side now becomes their belly or their backside and then their eye and nostril move towards what is now considered the back. This process is typically called the \\"metamorphosis.\\" Aquaculture The olive flounder is the most common flatfish species raised in aquaculture in Korea. They are raised in Japan and China as well. It is the most highly prized of the Japanese flounders. Although the aquaculture for the olive flounder started from the late 1980s, its commercial production didn't begin on a major scale until the 1990s in Korea. Parasites and food poisoning  Kudoa septempunctata in olive flounder muscles The myxozoan Kudoa septemlineata has been described in 2010 from olive flounder from Korea. This microscopic parasite infects the trunk muscles of the olive flounder where it causes myoliquefaction. Ingestion of raw fish containing K. septemlineata spores has been reported as a cause of food poisoning (gastroenteritis) in Japan since 2003. However, laboratory studies performed in 2015 and 2016 on adult and suckling mice showed that K. septemlineata spores were excreted in faeces and did not affect the gastrointestinal tract. Appearances in media The olive flounder has appeared in the video game series Animal Crossing as one of the various fish species the player is able to catch using a fishing rod.

Biological networks A network is a set of nodes and a set of directed or undirected edges between the nodes. Many types of biological networks exist, including transcriptional, signalling and metabolic. Few such networks are known in anything approaching their complete structure, even in the simplest bacteria. Still less is known on the parameters governing the behavior of such networks over time, how the networks at different levels in a cell interact, and how to predict the complete state description of a eukaryotic cell or bacterial organism at a given point in the future. Systems biology, in this sense, is still in its infancy. There is great interest in network medicine for the modelling biological systems. This article focuses on a necessary prerequisite to dynamic modeling of a network: inference of the topology, that is, prediction of the \\"wiring diagram\\" of the network. More specifically, we focus here on inference of biological network structure using the growing sets of high-throughput expression data for genes, proteins, and metabolites. Briefly, methods using high-throughput data for inference of regulatory networks rely on searching for patterns of partial correlation or conditional probabilities that indicate causal influence. Such patterns of partial correlations found in the high-throughput data, possibly combined with other supplemental data on the genes or proteins in the proposed networks, or combined with other information on the organism, form the basis upon which such algorithms work. Such algorithms can be of use in inferring the topology of any network where the change in state of one node can affect the state of other nodes. =Transcriptional regulatory networks= Genes are the nodes and the edges are directed. A gene serves as the source of a direct regulatory edge to a target gene by producing an RNA or protein molecule that functions as a transcriptional activator or inhibitor of the target gene. If the gene is an activator, then it is the source of a positive regulatory connection; if an inhibitor, then it is the source of a negative regulatory connection. Computational algorithms take as primary input data measurements of mRNA expression levels of the genes under consideration for inclusion in the network, returning an estimate of the network topology. Such algorithms are typically based on linearity, independence or normality assumptions, which must be verified on a case-by-case basis. Clustering or some form of statistical classification is typically employed to perform an initial organization of the high-throughput mRNA expression values derived from microarray experiments, in particular to select sets of genes as candidates for network nodes. The question then arises: how can the clustering or classification results be connected to the underlying biology? Such results can be useful for pattern classification ‚Äì for example, to classify subtypes of cancer, or to predict differential responses to a drug (pharmacogenomics). But to understand the relationships between the genes, that is, to more precisely define the influence of each gene on the others, the scientist typically attempts to reconstruct the transcriptional regulatory network. This can be done by data integration in dynamic models supported by background literature, or information in public databases, combined with the clustering results. The modelling can be done by a Boolean network, by Ordinary differential equations or Linear regression models, e.g. Least-angle regression, by Bayesian network or based on Information theory approaches. For instance it can be done by the application of a correlation-based inference algorithm, as will be discussed below, an approach which is having increased success as the size of the available microarray sets keeps increasing =Signal transduction= Signal transduction networks (very important in the biology of cancer). Proteins are the nodes and directed edges represent interaction in which the biochemical conformation of the child is modified by the action of the parent (e.g. mediated by phosphorylation, ubiquitylation, methylation, etc.). Primary input into the inference algorithm would be data from a set of experiments measuring protein activation / inactivation (e.g., phosphorylation / dephosphorylation) across a set of proteins. Inference for such signalling networks is complicated by the fact that total concentrations of signalling proteins will fluctuate over time due to transcriptional and translational regulation. Such variation can lead to statistical confounding. Accordingly, more sophisticated statistical techniques must be applied to analyse such datasets. =Metabolic= Metabolite networks. Metabolites are the nodes and the edges are directed. Primary input into an algorithm would be data from a set of experiments measuring metabolite levels. =Protein-protein interaction= Protein-protein interaction networks are also under very active study. However, reconstruction of these networks does not use correlation- based inference in the sense discussed for the networks already described (interaction does not necessarily imply a change in protein state), and a description of such interaction network reconstruction is left to other articles.

It is used in places where, due to terrain and other factors, the localizer antenna array is not aligned with the runway it serves. In these cases, the localizer antenna array may be offset (i.e. pointed or aimed) in such a way that the approach course it projects no longer lies along the extended runway centerline (which is the norm for non-offset and non-LDA localizer systems). If the angle of offset is three degrees or less, the facility is classified as an offset localizer. If the offset angle is greater than three degrees, the facility is classified as a localizer-type directional aid (LDA). Straight-in approaches may be published if the offset angle does not exceed 30 degrees. Only circling minimums are published for offset angles greater than 30 degrees. As a \\"directional aid,\\" and only a Category I (CAT I) approach, rather than a full- fledged instrument landing system (ILS), the LDA is more commonly used to help the pilot safely reach a point near the runway environs, where he or she hopefully can see the runway, at which point he or she will proceed and land visually, as opposed to (for example) full Category III (CAT III) ILS systems that allow a pilot to fly, without visual references, very close to the runway surface (usually about 100 ft) depending on the exact equipment in the aircraft and on the ground. An LDA uses exactly the same equipment to create the course as a standard localizer used in ILS. An LDA approach also is designed with a normal course width, which is typically 3 to 6 degrees. (At each \\"edge-of-course,\\" commonly 1.5 or 3 degrees left and right of course, the transmitted signal is created in such a way as to ensure full-scale CDI needle deflection at and beyond these edges, so the pilot will never falsely believe they are intercepting the course outside of the actual course area. The area between these full-scale needle deflections is what defines the course width.) An LDA approach (considered a non-precision approach) may have one or more marker beacons, perhaps a DME, and in rare instances a glide slope, just as other precision approaches have, such as ILS approaches. If the offset is not greater than 30 degrees, straight-in approach minima may be published; circling minima only are published when offset exceeds 30 degrees.AIM, 1-1-9c2As of September 2011, there are LDA approaches which have straight-in minima published despite the localizer being offset more than 30 degrees: e.g., \\"LDA/DME RWY 19\\" and \\"ROSSLYN LDA RWY 19\\" approaches to Runway 19 at DCA have 145 and 147 degrees respectively on their final approach course to the airport.  List of LDA approaches in the United States  The following 29 LDA approaches are available in the United States (as of June 2016):This count reflects only clearly distinct approaches, i.e. if multiple LDA approach procedures to the same runway are available (all of which use the same localizer) they are counted as one. For instance, KSFO has \\"LDA/DME RWY 28R\\" and \\"LDA PRM RWY 28R (SIMULTANEOUS CLOSE PARALLEL)\\" approaches, which are essentially two different versions of the same approach, the latter one developed specifically for use in simultaneous parallel approaches to runways 28R (using LDA) and 28L (using ILS or RNAV). On the other hand, KDCA has two different LDA approaches to runway 19, which use different localizers, so they are both counted individually. # PAJN, LDA X RWY 08, Juneau International Airport, Juneau, AK # PAPG, LDA/DME-D, Petersburg James A.

The corps came to prominence between 1805 and 1809 under the command of Marshal Louis-Nicolas Davout, when it repeatedly scored impressive victories single-handedly or in conjunction with other French forces. Napoleon called it \\"My tenth legion\\", in reference to Julius Caesar's finest unit, the X Equestris. Troops from III Corps then took part in many battles in Poland (1807) e.g. Czarnowo, Pultusk, Golymin, Eylau, in Bavaria at Teugen-Hausen and Eckmuhl, and in Austria at Wagram in 1809. These troops were later reorganized as the I Corps and included French, German, and Polish units. It also included the 127th to 129th \\"r√©giment d'infanterie de ligne\\" from the North German countries of Oldenburg, Bremen, and Hamburg that were annexed shortly before and thus counted as French. A parallel III Corps existed in Spain from 1808 until 1811 when it became the Army of Aragon. Its commanders were Marshal Bon-Adrien Jeannot de Moncey, General Jean-Andoche Junot, and Marshal Louis-Gabriel Suchet. Cobbled together from hastily raised French conscripts and Polish auxiliaries, the corps later became one of the most effective French forces in Spain under Suchet. Size By the time of Napoleon's invasion of Russia in 1812, the III Corps had been reorganized and went under the command of Marshal Michel Ney. It consisted of Croatian, French, Portuguese, and W√ºrttemberger units and like the rest of Napoleon's forces, suffered heavy casualties as the campaign progressed. At the crossing of the Niemen River in 1812, the size of the corps was estimated at around 44,000 men; by the Battle of Smolensk, only 22,000 men remained. Battles The corps participated in a number of battles, including Austerlitz, Auerstedt, Eylau, Teugen-Hausen, Eckm√ºhl, Wagram, Borodino, L√ºtzen, Bautzen, Katzbach, Leipzig, Ligny, and Waterloo.

The vessel was used by Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine between 1943 and 1945. The name comes from the constructor Richard Mohr whose surname means Moor. Design The Neger was based on the G7e torpedo and sported a spartan cockpit covered by a perspex dome, where the warhead would have been. It had sufficient positive buoyancy to run awash while supporting a second G7e, with warhead, slung below. The vessel had a range of 48 nautical miles at 4 knots and displaced 2.7 tons. The pilot navigated via a wrist compass and air was provided through a Dr√§ger self- contained breathing device. The pilot aimed his weapon by lining up an aiming spike on the nose with a graduated scale on the dome. Subsequently, a second aiming spike was added closer to the dome. It, however, made little difference as water washing over the dome made visibility extremely poor. A simple lever in the cockpit irreversibly started the torpedo and released it. Though not designed as a suicide weapon, the Neger would frequently become one when the torpedo started running but failed to release, and carried the craft and its pilot toward the target. About 200 vessels of this type were manufactured in 1944. The first Neger vessels entered service in March 1944. However, the Neger turned out to be very hazardous for its operator and up to 80 percent were killed. In return one cruiser, one destroyer, and three Catherine Class BAMS minesweepers were sunk in 1944 with the weapon. The first mission took place on the night of 20/21 April 1944. Thirty Negers were launched against Allied ships berthed in Anzio. Only 17 of them managed to deploy, with the other 13 capsizing upon reaching the water. Three failed to return and up until then, the Allies had no knowledge of this new unusual weapon. None had made any successful attacks. Normandy attacks Diagram of a Neger Two major assaults were carried out with Neger vessels against the Allied invasion fleet off Normandy before the Allies broke out from the landing site and forced the submarines to relocate out of reach of Normandy. The Neger flotilla consisted of some 40 vessels and operated from Favrol Woods near Honfleur on the south bank of the Seine opposite Le Havre. On 5/6 July 1944, 24 Negers attacked the invasion fleet, sinking two British minesweepers, and . Nine Negers returned from the mission. The second attack was mounted on the night of July 7/8 and was carried out by 21 Negers. These were spotted in the moonlight and attacked by aircraft and ships. The Germans sank another minesweeper, , and severely damaged the Polish cruiser , which was later scuttled. There is a detailed account of the attack on Dragon by the Neger pilot, Midshipman Potthast, who was captured several hours later. On 20 July 1944, the Royal Navy destroyer was mined while at anchor in the Seine Bay. The loss was discovered the next morning. There were 20 survivors. German human torpedoes were suspected of sinking the warship. The Hunt class destroyer was an escort for convoys of personnel during Operation Neptune, the naval support of Operation Overlord, the D-Day Landings. On 3 August, she was hit and sunk during a mass attack on the British assault area by a force of E-boats, explosive motorboats, human torpedoes and low-flying aircraft. Those on HMS Quorn that survived the initial attack spent up to eight hours in the water before being rescued and many of these perished; four officers and 126 seamen were lost. Later attacks The Isles-class trawler HMS Colsay was sunk in shallow water by a Neger on 2 November 1944 near Ostend, Belgium.

It is usually used to apply support to the longitudinal rotary axis of a workpiece being machined. A lathe center is mounted in the tailstock, and inserted against the sides of a hole in the center of the workpiece. A tailstock has a Dead Center, while headstock has Live Center. A Tailstock is particularly useful when the workpiece is relatively long and slender. Failing to use a tailstock can cause \\"chatter,\\" where the workpiece bends excessively while being cut. It is also used on a lathe to hold drilling or reaming tools for machining a hole in the work piece. Unlike drilling with a drill press or a milling machine, the tool is stationary while the workpiece rotates. Holes can only be cut along the axis that the workpiece is set to spin. Usually, the entire tailstock is moved to the approximate position that it will be needed by manually sliding it along its ways. There, it is locked in place and the tool mounted to it is moved with a leadscrew to the exact position where it is needed. When a cutting tool such as a drill bit or reamer is used, the feed is done with this leadscrew. The tailstock quill or extendible portion usually has a Morse taper mount in the end of it to secure the drill or reamer. If the work is heavy the drill may be further secured from turning with a lathe dog as shown in the photo.

Little is known about Korn as evidence from the 15th and 16th Centuries in Cambodia is sparse. thumb  History   The battle between Srey SokunBoth and Sdach Korn  = Preah Srey Sokunboth's dream = When Preah Srey Sokunboth went to sleep, he dreamed of a powerful dragon chased Srey Sokunboth and everyone in the kingdom outside, and breathed fire burned down the kingdom, then stole the king's umbrella to east-side. Tomorrow morning, Srey Sokunboth got worried about the weird dream that he had had. Srey Sokunboth went to the prophet and was told that Sdach Korn would one day betrayed and overthrown Srey Sokunboth and steal the title as the earth's king. Srey Sokunboth had a meeting with all his loyal followers to find the solutions to the problem. Srey Sokunboth and his followers planned to fake stuck a fishing-net and let Sdach Korn go fix it, then throw another fishing- net to drown him in the river. After overheard Srey Skounboth's plan, Neang Pov rush to tell Sdach Korn about the plan. The day had come for Srey Sokunboth's plan to proceed when Srey Sokunboth order Sdach Korn to fix the net, Sdach Korn decides to swim far away and escape to the east side while Srey Sokunboth thought Korn had drowned in the river. = Sdach Korn Uprising = When Sdach Korn got to the east-side, he started a rumor of Chan Reachea being betrayed and planned an attack by Preah Srey Sokunboth. While worrying about his people, Chan Reachea decided to evacuate to Siem but had help Ta Mueng's family on his way of fleeing, and Ta Mueng promised to pay back his debt. In 1512, Sdach Korn infiltrated Srey Sokunboth in Toul BaSan badly. Srey Sokunboth had no choice but to flee to Kompong Svay Province. Sdach Korn set his camp at Santouk Mountain and tricked Meun SorintKeo to get 200 followers to infiltrate Srey Sokunboth. Srey Sokunboth knew that Sdach Korn followers would soon come, so he flees to Pursat province, but Meun SorintKeo had killed Srey Sokunboth on the way. After the victory, Sdach Korn order general Kaw to take care of those who disobey to join forces with him.  Sdach Korn as Srei Chetha Thireach Reameathiptei  In 1512, Sdach Korn set his kingdom back in Toul BaSan. In 1514, Sdach Korn set his kingdom in other provinces and ascended the throne, became Srei Chetha Thireach Reameathiptei, and promoted general Keo as Somdach Chawhva Tolh to look after other officials. Srei Chettha Thireach Reameathiptei promoted every official and The provincial governor. Srei Chetha Thireach Reameathiptei expanded the north-side to ChampaSak, the east-side to Champa kingdom, the south-side to the sea and the west-side to Reach Seima kingdom. When Sdach Korn ascended to the throne, the business sector ran smoothly and effectively. One night, Sdach Korn dreamed of the moon rise from the west-side and pierce through his heart, the prophet believed that Chan Reachea, who had to flee to Siem, will come back to take revenge.  Battle between Preah Chan Reachea and Srei Chetha  After hearing the news about Srey SokunBoth's death, Chan Reachea and Ponhea Oung went back home. Chan Reachea lied that he would catch the white elephant for Sdach Siem. Sdach Siem provided Chan Reachea with 5,000 soldiers, 100 elephant soldiers, food, and weapons with the sword of war. In 1516, when Chan Reachea steps foot in Cambodia's border, he asked for more soldiers. Ponhea Oung went back to Sdach Siam and told the truth. Sdach Siem got angry and ordered his followers to bring back Chan Reachea. Chan Reachea revealed the sword of war, and Sdach Siam's followers retreated. Chan Reachea gathered 3,000 more soldiers in Battambang province, 8,000 soldiers in Siem Reap province, and 3,000 more soldiers in Pursat province by Ta Mueng. The provincial governor of Pursat province named SurKea Lok Keo gave the news about Chan Reachea to Sdach Korn. Sdach Korn ordered master Kaw to battle Chan Reachea. Chan Reachea promoted Ta Mueng as the governor of Pursat province. Sdach Korn gathered a big army in Longvek under Somdach Chawhva Tolh command. Chan Reachea retreated to Pursat fortress. Unfortunately, Somdach Chawhva Tolh caught up to Chan Reachea and surrounded him for 12 months. Ta Pich (Ta Mueng) sacrificed himself and gathered demon soldiers from hell to help Chan Reachea in battle. From that point on, Chan Reachea always had an advantage over Sdach Korn. Chan Reachea got back Krokor, Khlong Krang, BoriBo, Kompong Siem, Boribur, Cheungoprei, Stung Treng. At that moment, most of Sdach Korn's soldiers became submissive with Chan Reachea. Srei SokunBoth's soldiers were also submissive to Chan Reachea. In 1516, Ponhea Sor died. The people wanted Chan Reachea on the throne, he agreed. On the throne, Chan Reachea found his majesty's sword and spear and his belongings. Chan Reachea set his city in Banteay Meanchey and Pursat. In 1517, Sdach Korn sends an assassin to assassinate Chan Reachea, but had failed. In 1525, after acquiring cannons, Chan Reachea continued to attack Srei Chetha. Chan Reachea separated into three groups, formed a triangle surrounding Srei Sorchor fortress. Srei Chetha and master Kaw escaped to Sralob Pichy town. Chan Reachea went to Sralob Pichy town. In 3 months, Chan Reachea killed master Kaw and cut Srei Chetha head off. From that moment on, Srei Chetha is known as Sdach Korn.

Early life Pierre Pigneau was born in Origny-en-Thi√©rache (later Aisne, France), where the family of his mother lived. His father's family owned a small estate named B√©haine, in the nearby parish of Marle. Despite the particule \\"de B√©haine\\" in his name, Pigneau was not of noble extraction, and it seems the particule first appeared only in the 1787 Treaty of Versailles.Mantienne, p.204 Pigneau de Behaine was trained as a missionary and sent abroad by the Paris Foreign Missions Society (S√©minaire des Missions √âtrang√®res). He left France from the harbour of Lorient in December 1765, to work in southern Vietnam. He landed in Pondicherry, then a French possession in India, on 21 June 1766.Mantienne, p.37 Pigneau had arrived just prior to the Burmese capture of Ayutthaya in Siam. After waiting for a few months in the Portuguese colony of Macau, Pigneau travelled on a Chinese ship to reach the small coastal town H√† Ti√™n in Cochinchina (Southern Vietnam) near the Cambodian border, set up by missionaries who had been displaced by the Burmese. He arrived there in March 1767.Mantienne, p.40-48 Superior of the College General (1767-1774) In Ha Tien, Pigneau worked as head of the Seminary of the Holy Angels, the Seminary established in Asia by the Paris Foreign Missions Society, which had relocated from Ayutthaya in Siam following the 1765 Burmese invasion, with approximately forty students of Chinese, Siamese, and Vietnamese extraction. Annamite-Latin manuscript dictionary created by Pigneau de Behaine. In 1768, the missionaries were jailed for three months when Siamese authorities complained to the local ruler M·∫°c Thi√™n T·ª© that the school had afforded shelter to a fugitive Siamese prince. Pigneau was put into a cangue, a wooden and iron frame fastened around his limbs weighing eight pounds.Mantienne, pp.40-41 He ignored family requests to return to France, saying that his missionary work was more important than a comfortable life. In 1769, the school was attacked by Chinese and Cambodian pirates, who massacred some of the students and burnt down the establishment...Mantienne, p.53 Pigneau was forced to flee in December 1769 with the survivors to Pondicherry, then a French territory, after a long sea journey through Malacca. The College was established a few miles from Pondicherry, in Virampatnam. Pigneau de Behaine's dictionary was published in 1838 by Mgr Jean-Louis Taberd. While in Pondicherry, Pigneau continued mastering Chinese and Vietnamese languages until he was fully conversant with both. In 1773, he compiled a Vietnamese-Latin dictionary with the help of eight southern Vietnamese,Mantiennne, p.67 following in the footsteps of Alexandre de Rhodes. His work, Dictionarium Anamitico-Latinum, would be published in 1838 by Mgr Jean-Louis Taberd.Manteigne, p.67 Pigneau de Behaine was appointed bishop in partibus infidelium of Adran in Syria, and Apostolic Vicar of Cochinchina on 24 September 1771. After his ordination on 24 February 1774 in S√£o Tom√© near Madras,Mantienne, p.57Les Missions Etrangeres, p.104 he went to Macau to gather more staff before returning to resume his work in Ha Tien. In Macau, he was able to publish and print a catechism in Vietnamese (containing an introduction in Chinese, the body of the text in the Vietnamese alphabet, and a translation in Latin), and despatched a copy to Rome. He left Macau on 1 March 1775, and reached Ha Tien later in the month, where he again re-established missionary operations.Mantienne, p.73 In 1775-76, Pigneau attempted to convert the Stieng people, but the missionaries he sent suffered greatly, and either fell ill or returned.Mantienne, pp.74-75 Encounter with Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh Episcopal seal of Mgr Pigneau de Behaine. In 1777, the T√¢y S∆°n brothers attacked Saigon and eliminated almost the entire Nguy·ªÖn dynasty, with the fifteen-year-old Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh managing to escape into the far south. He took refuge at Pigneau's seminary from September to October before both were forced to flee to the island of Pulo Panjang in the Gulf of Siam. The move was a political step taken by Pigneau to align himself with Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh, allowing himself a foray into politics. He became less of a missionary and more of a politician thereafter. In November 1777, Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh was able to recapture Saigon, and in 1778 pursued the retreating T√¢y S∆°n as far as B√¨nh Thu·∫≠n.Mantienne, p.78 In neighbouring Cambodia, a pro-Cochinchinese revolt erupted to topple the pro-Siam king Ang Non. In 1780, Cochinchinese troops intervened, and Pigneau helped them procure weapons from the Portuguese. The Bishop attracted accusations by the Portuguese of manufacturing weapons for the Cochinchinese, especially grenades, a new weapon for Southeast Asia. Pigneau de Behaine also organized the supply of three Portuguese warships for Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh. In his activities, Pigneau was supported by a French adventurer, Manuel.Mantienne, p.81 Pigneau de Behaine and Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh took refuge in the island of Ph√∫ Qu·ªëc. In 1782, the T√¢y S∆°n led a new offensive to the South. Manuel died in his command of a warship in the Saigon river against T√¢y S∆°n troops. The defeat, with its battle plan deemed faulty, towers high in the list of setbacks suffered. Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh was forced to retreat to the island of Ph√∫ Qu·ªëc. In October 1782, the tide turned again and Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh and Pigneau returned to Saigon.Mantienne, p.82 In March 1783, the Nguy·ªÖn were again defeated, and Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh and Pigneau once more set sail for Ph√∫ Qu·ªëc. Sanctuary was at once both fleeting and illusory. They had to escape again when their hideout was discovered, being chased from island to island until they reached Siam. Pigneau de Behaine visited the Siamese court in Bangkok in late 1783.Mantienne, p.83 Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh also arrived there in February 1784, where he enlisted an army to accompany him back to Vietnam.Mantienne, p.84 In January 1785 however the Siamese fleet met with disaster against the T√¢y S∆°n in the Mekong river. Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh again took refuge with the Siamese court, and again tried to seek help from the Siamese.Mantienne, pp.84-85 Resolving to muster any support he could from Western powers., Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh asked Pigneau to appeal for French aid, and pledged to allow Pigneau to take his son Prince C·∫£nh with him. Pigneau in return attempted to obtain assistance from Manila, but the party of Dominicans he sent was captured by the T√¢y S∆°n.Mantienne, p.85 From Pondicherry, he also sent a request for help to the Portuguese Senate in Macao, which would ultimately lead to the signature of a Treaty of Alliance between Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh and the Portuguese on 18 December 1786 in Bangkok.Mantienne, p.87 Embassy to France The party reached Pondicherry in February 1785.Mantienne, p.84, p.200 The French administration in Pondicherry, led by the interim Governor Coutenceau des Algrains, successor of Bussy, seconded by Captain d'Entrecasteaux, was resolutely opposed to intervening in southern Vietnam, stating that it was not in the national interest. In July 1786, Pigneau was allowed to travel back to France to ask the royal court directly for assistance. News of his activities reached Rome where he was denounced by the Spanish Franciscans. Pigneau at that point offered Prince C·∫£nh and his political mandate to the Portuguese. They left Pondicherry for France in July 1786.Mantienne, p.92 which they reached in February 1787.Mantienne, p.93 Portrait of crown prince Nguy·ªÖn Ph√∫c C·∫£nh in France, 1787.

This was due to the poor financial state of the country prior to the French Revolution. Pigneau was helped by Pierre Poivre who had been involved previously in French interests in Vietnam. Eventually, he was able to seduce military figures with precise instructions as to the conditions of warfare in Indochina and materiel for the proposed campaign.

On 21 November 1787, the Treaty of Versailles was concluded between France and Cochinchina in Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh's name. Four frigates, 1650 fully equipped French soldiers and 250 Indian sepoys were promised in return for Pulo Condore and harbour access at Tourane (Da Nang). De Fresne was supposed to be the leader of the expedition.Mantienne, p.97 The French government, on the eve of the French Revolution, was in dreadful financial trouble,Mantienne, p.106 and saw its position weakened even more with the outbreak of civil war in Holland.Mantienne, p.104 French enthusiasm for Pigneau's plan was severely dampened.Mantienne, p.103-108 A few days after the treaty was signed, the foreign minister sent instructions on 2 December 1787 to the Governor of Pondicherry Thomas Conway, which left the execution of the treaty to his own appreciation of the situation in Asia, stating that he was \\"free not to accomplish the expedition, or to delay it, according to his own opinion\\"Mantienne, p.98. Original French: \\"il √©tait \\"ma√Ætre de ne point entreprendre l'op√©ration ou de la retarder, d'apr√®s son opinion personnele\\"\\" Louis XVI himself told Pigneau that Conway was appointed Governor of Pondicherry simply to remove him from Europe. Return to Vietnam The Citadel of Saigon was built by Olivier de Puymanel according to the designs of Th√©odore Lebrun, following the principles of Vauban, in 1790. Jean-Marie Dayot (left) took a leading role in the Navy of Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh. The party left France in December 1787 on board the Dryade,Mantienne, p.109-110 commanded by M. de Kersaint and accompanied by the Pandour, commanded by M. de Pr√©ville. They would again disembark in Pondicherry from May 1788 to July 1789.Mantienne, p.110 The Dryade was ordered by Conway to continue to Poulo Condor to meet with Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh and deliver him 1,000 muskets bought in France and Father Paul Nghi, a Cochinchinese missionary devotee of Mgr Pigneau. However, Pigneau found the governor of Pondicherry unwilling to further fulfill the agreement. Although the Royal Council had already decided in October 1788 to endorse Conway, Pigneau was not informed until April. Pigneau was forced to use funds raised in France and enlist French volunteers. Of this duplicity, he defiantly noted: \\"I shall make the revolution in Cochinchina alone.\\" He rejected an offer from the English, and raised money from French merchants in the region. Conway finally provided two ships to Pigneau, the M√©duse, commanded by Fran√ßois √âtienne de Rosily-Mesros, and another frigate.\\"Conway finally provided the frigate Meduse and another vessel to repatriate the mission\\" in The Roots of French Imperialism in Eastern Asia ‚Äì Page 14 by John Frank Cady 1967 Pigneau used the raised funds to equip two more ships with weapons and ammunition, which he named the Long (\\"Dragon\\"), commanded by Jean-Baptiste Chaigneau, and the Ph·ª•ng (\\"Phoenix\\"), commanded by Philippe Vannier, and enticed volunteers and deserters to man the vessels. Jean-Marie Dayot deserted the Pandour and was put in charge of supplies, transporting weapons and ammunitions on his ship the St. Esprit.

Olivier de Puymanel, a former officer of the Dryade who has deserted in Poulo Condor, built in 1790 the Citadel of Saigon and in 1793 the Citadel of Di√™n Kh√°nh according to the principles of Vauban. He also instructed Vietnamese troops in the modern use of artillery, and implemented European infantry methods in the Vietnamese army of Nguy·ªÖn Ph√∫c √Ånh.The Vietnamese Response to French Intervention, 1862‚Äì1874 by Mark W. McLeod, p.11 In 1792, Olivier de Puymanel was commanding an army of 600 men who had been trained with European techniques.Mantienne, p.153 Puymanel is said to have trained the 50,000 men of Nguyen's army.Colonialism by Melvin Eugene Page, Penny M. Sonnenburg, p.723 French bombs were used at the siege of Qui Nh∆°n in 1793.Mantienne, p.132 French Navy officers such as Jean-Marie Dayot and Jean-Baptiste Chaigneau were used to drill the navy. By 1792, a large naval fleet was formed, with two European warships and 15 frigates of composite design.Mantienne, p.129 In 1792, Dayot attacked the strategically important port of Qui Nh∆°n, opening the way to the Cochinchinese ships which then defeated the T√¢y S∆°n fleet. In 1793, Dayot led a raid in which 60 T√¢y S∆°n galleys were destroyed.Mantienne, p.130 From 1794, Pigneau took part in all campaigns, accompanying Prince C·∫£nh. He organized the defense of Di√™n Kh√°nh when it was besieged by a numerically vastly superior T√¢y S∆°n army in 1794.Mantienne, p.135 Death Tomb of Pigneau de Behaine. Heavy fighting raged in Qui Nh∆°n for control of the fortress until it was captured in 1799. Pigneau died there of dysentery on 9 October in the same year, after serving his final years as an advisor and de facto foreign minister to Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh. He was buried at Saigon with full military honours. Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh's funeral oration described him as \\"the most illustrious foreigner ever to appear at the court of Cochinchina.\\" He was buried on 16 December 1799 in the presence of the crown prince, all mandarins of the court, the royal bodyguard of 12,000 men and 40,000 mourners. Pigneau de Behaine was the object of several funeral orations on behalf of emperor Gia Long and his son Prince C·∫£nh.Mantienne, p.219-228 In a funeral oration dated 8 December 1799, Gia Long praised Pigneau de Behaine's involvement in the defense of the country, as well as their personal friendship: Pigneau de Behaine was granted the position Th√°i t·ª≠ Th√°i ph√≥ (Â§™Â≠êÂ§™ÂÇÖ, \\"Crown Prince's Tutor\\") and the noble title Bi Nhu Qu·∫≠n c√¥ng (ÊÇ≤ÊüîÈÉ°ÂÖ¨, lit. \\"provincial duke Bi Nhu\\") posthumously.

Only a few of Pigneau's men stayed for more than two or three year, disappointed in the lack of a quick fortune. Pigneau himself had wanted a Catholic as ruler of Vietnam. His ambition never materialised with the failure to convert Canh, who predeceased his father Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh by twenty years in any case. Pigneau often compromised his religious principles when they came into conflict with political and diplomatic imperatives. He had initially taught Canh to refuse to engage in ancestor worship, something that greatly shocked and angered Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh. He later changed his mind on the papal ban and proposed to consider ancestor worship as a civil ceremony, a simple manifestation of respect for the dead. He cited the apostles as being tolerant of local customs as his justification. Ashes of Pigneau de Behaine, at the Paris Foreign Missions Society.

The head of the mission was Takenouchi Yasunori, governor of Shimotsuke Province (present-day Tochigi Prefecture). The head of the mission staff was Shibata Takenaka Sadataro. Fukuzawa Yukichi was a member of the mission, acting as one of the two translators. The mission numbered 40 men. Despite the name, it is more accurately the third Japanese embassy to Europe, being preceded by the Tensho Embassy (1582‚Äì1590) and the expedition led by Hasekura Tsunenaga between 1613 and 1620. Itinerary Leaving Shinagawa, Tokyo on 21 January 1862, the mission was sent in order to learn about Western civilization, ratify treaties, and delay the opening of cities and harbours to foreign trade. Negotiations were held in France, the UK, the Netherlands, Prussia, Russia, and finally Portugal. The mission eventually returned to Tokyo on 30 January 1863. The members of the mission were extensively photographed by Nadar. In London, the Mission visited the 1862 World Fair. Five years later, Japan would formally participate to the 1867 World Fair in Paris. The mission was concluded by the London Protocol, signed on 6 June 1862, which recognized that Japan needed time to \\"overcome the opposition now existing\\" (meaning the anti-foreign sentiment shared by the population and the Imperial Court), and accepted the postponement of the opening of Osaka, Hyogo, Edo, and Niigata by five years, to 1 January 1868.French Policy in Japan by Medzini, p.35-37 See also * Japanese Embassy to the United States (1860) * Second Japanese Embassy to Europe (1863) * Iwakura mission * France‚ÄìJapan relations (19th century) References Bibliography *Shin Jinbutsu ≈årai-sha, eds.: Ikokujin no Mita Bakumatsu‚ÄìMeiji Japan, Aiz≈ç-ban (Áï∞ÂõΩ‰∫∫„ÅÆË¶ã„ÅüÂπïÊú´„ÉªÊòéÊ≤ªJAPAN ÊÑõËîµÁâà: Bakumatsu and Meiji Japan in the Eyes of Foreigners, Enthusiasts‚Äô Edition).

Arthur Valentijn Japin (born 26 July 1956 in Haarlem) is a Dutch novelist. Biography His parents were Bert Japin, a teacher and writer of detective novels, and Annie Japin-van Arnhem. After a difficult childhood‚Äîhis father killed himself when Arthur was twelve years old‚ÄîJapin entered the Kleinkunstacademie in Amsterdam, where he trained as an actor. He was also briefly an opera singer at De Nederlandse Opera in Amsterdam. His first novel, De zwarte met het witte hart (1997), translated as The Two Hearts of Kwasi Boachi, was the story of two Ashanti princes, Kwame Poku and Kwasi Boachi, who were taken from today's Ghana and taken to the court of the Dutch king Willem I in 1837. The book became a bestseller and is considered a classic of modern Dutch literature. In November 2007, an opera based on the novel premiered in Rotterdam, with an English libretto by Arthur Japin and music by the British composer Jonathan Dove. His second book, De droom van de leeuw (2002), is a novelized version of his relationship with the Dutch actress and novelist Rosita Steenbeek in Rome, where Steenbeek became the last lover of the Italian director Federico Fellini. His third novel, Een schitterend gebrek, translated as In Lucia's Eyes (2003), was a return to the historical novel, about Casanova's first lover, Lucia, who, he reports in his memoirs, inexplicably abandoned him in his youth, only to resurface years later as a hideous prostitute in an Amsterdam brothel. Japin was hailed as a great writer after his first couple of novels already, a status confirmed when he was asked to write the 2006 Boekenweekgeschenk: De grote wereld is a novella about a pair of circus-performing dwarves caught in Nazi Germany, which had a record first printing of 813,000 copies.Anon., \\"Book week gift\\" , transportticket.com, 2006.Otje, \\"De zwarte met het witte hart\\" , Otje blogt cultuur, Oct. 21, 2012. His 2007 novel De overgave, to be translated as Someone Found, takes the subject of the 19th-century Texas‚ÄìIndian wars, dramatizing the story of the Fort Parker Massacre of 1836, in which a white girl, Cynthia Ann Parker, was taken as a Comanche hostage, later becoming the mother of the famous Comanche chief Quanah Parker. Japin has also published several volumes of stories. The first two, Magonische verhalen and De vierde wand, were gathered into the omnibus Alle verhalen, (2005).

Image of group assign features on individual mix channels of a mixing console. Green arrows indicate group assign buttons. Stem-mixing is a method of mixing audio material based on creating groups of audio tracks and processing them separately prior to combining them into a final master mix. Stems are also sometimes referred to as submixes, subgroups, or busses. The distinction between a stem and a separation is rather unclear. Some consider stem manipulation to be the same as separation mastering, although others consider stems to be sub-mixes to be used along with separation mastering. It depends on how many separate channels of input are available for mixing and/or at which stage they are on the way towards reducing them to a final stereo mix. The technique originated in the 1960s, with the introduction of mixing boards equipped with the capability to assign individual inputs to sub-group faders and to work with each sub-group (stem mix) independently from the others. The approach is widely used in recording studios to control, process and manipulate entire groups of instruments such as drums, strings, or backup vocals, in order to streamline and simplify the mixing process. Additionally, as each stem-bus usually has its own inserts, sends and returns, the stem-mix (sub-mix) can be routed independently through its own signal processing chain, to achieve a different effect for each group of instruments. A similar method is also utilised with digital audio workstations (DAWs), where separate groups of audio tracks may be digitally processed and manipulated through discrete chains of plugins. Stem-mastering is a technique derived from stem mixing. Just as in stem- mixing, the individual audio tracks are grouped together, to allow for independent control and signal processing of each stem, and can be manipulated independently from each other. Most of the mastering engineers require music producers to have at least -3db headroom at each individual track before starting stem mastering process. The reason for this is to leave more space in the mix to make the mastered version sound cleaner and louder. Even though it is not commonly practiced by mastering studios, it does have its proponents. Stem In audio production, a stem is a group of audio sources mixed together, usually by one person, to be dealt with downstream as one unit. A single stem may be delivered in mono, stereo, or in multiple tracks for surround sound. In sound mixing for film, the preparation of stems is a common stratagem to facilitate the final mix. Dialogue, music and sound effects, called \\"D-M-E\\", are brought to the final mix as separate stems. Using stem mixing, the dialogue can easily be replaced by a foreign-language version, the effects can easily be adapted to different mono, stereo and surround systems, and the music can be changed to fit the desired emotional response. If the music and effects stems are sent to another production facility for foreign dialogue replacement, these non-dialogue stems are called \\"M&E;\\". The dialogue stem is used by itself when editing various scenes together to construct a trailer of the film; after this some music and effects are mixed in to form a cohesive sequence. In music mixing for recordings and for live sound, stems are subgroups of similar sound sources. When a large project uses more than one person mixing, stems can facilitate the job of the final mix engineer. Such stems may consist of all of the string instruments, a full orchestra, just background vocals, only the percussion instruments, a single drum set, or any other grouping that may ease the task of the final mix. Stems prepared in this fashion may be blended together later in time, as for a recording project or for consumer listening, or they may be mixed simultaneously, as in a live sound performance with multiple elements. For instance, when Barbra Streisand toured in 2006 and 2007, the audio production crew used three people to run three mixing consoles: one to mix strings, one to mix brass, reeds and percussion, and one under main engineer Bruce Jackson's control out in the audience, containing Streisand's microphone inputs and stems from the other two consoles. Stems may be supplied to a musician in the recording studio so that the musician can adjust a headphones monitor mix by varying the levels of other instruments and vocals relative to the musician's own input. Stems may also be delivered to the consumer so they can listen to a piece of music with a custom blend of the separate elements.

Ma'arrat Misrin lies an elevation of . It is located 50 kilometers southwest of Aleppo and 40 kilometers north of Ma'arrat al-Numan and 12 kilometers from Sarmin. Nearby localities include Kafr Yahmul to the north, Zardana and Maarrat al-Ikhwan to the northeast, Taftanaz to the east, Ta'um, Binnish, al- Fu'ah and Kafriya to the southeast, Idlib to the south, and Hafasraja to the southwest. According to the Syria Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) Ma'arrat Misrin had a population of 17,519 in the 2004 census. It is the administrative center of a nahiya which consists of 16 localities with a total population of 57,859 in 2004.General Census of Population and Housing 2004. Syria Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS). Idlib Governorate. Archived at . The Associated Press estimated the population of Ma'arrat Misrin was around 40,000 in 2012. The city's inhabitants are predominantly Sunni Muslims, although roughly 15% follow Shia Islam. Etymology According to medieval Muslim geographers al- Muqaddasi and Abu'l-Fida, the town was originally called in Arabic ‚ÄúMa æarrat Qinnasrƒ´n‚Äù in reference to Jund Qinnasrin, the province to which it belonged.Al-Mukaddasi, ed. Le Strange 1886, p. 9. The name was often shortened to ‚ÄúMa æarrat Nasrƒ´n‚Äù and corrupted in later works as ‚ÄúMa æarrat Masrƒ´n‚Äù. Syriac manuscripts dating back to the 8th century refer to the town as ‚ÄúMa'arrat Mesren‚Äù. The town was known to the Crusaders as ‚ÄúMegaret Basrin‚Äù or ‚ÄúMeguaret Mesrin‚Äù.le Strange, 1890, p. 497 History =Early Islamic era= Ma'arat Misrin was captured by the Muslim army of Abu Ubaidah ibn al Jarrah in 637 CE after defeating a Byzantine force in the Battle of Hazir between the town and Aleppo. Like Aleppo, it surrendered under peaceful terms. Ma'arat Misrin is referred to as \\"Ma'arat Mesren\\" in 8th-century Syriac manuscripts. Amr ibn Hawbar served as its governor during the reign of Abbasid caliph al- Mutawakkil.Houtsma, 1987, p. 58. Byzantine general Nikephoros II Phokas conquered Ma'arat Misrin in 968 and expelled its 1,200 inhabitants to Anatolia. The following year he made a truce with the Fatimids whereby the latter would gain control over the town. The Bani Kilab under the leadership of Salih ibn Mirdas launched an expedition to conquer Aleppo in 1024. During the offensive Mirdas's commander Abu Mansur Sulayman ibn Tawk captured Ma'arrat Misrin and imprisoned its governor. Later, before 1063, the Byzantines recaptured the town after Salih‚Äôs son Atiyya defected from his nephew Mahmud ibn Nasr's army, which was attacking Baalbek. Atiyya and the Byzantine army of Antioch subsequently raided Ma'arrat Misrin, burned its outskirts and killed several of its inhabitants. The Seljuks captured it towards the end of the 11th century, and the Seljuk prince of Antioch, Yaghi- Basan, died in Ma'arat Misrin in 1097. =Crusades= In 1099, Ma'arat Misrin was conquered by the Crusaders who killed the town's defenders and destroyed the minbar (\\"pulpit\\") of its mosque. However, after the capture of Baldwin I of Edessa, the inhabitants of Ma'arat Misrin and nearby al-Fu'ah and Sarmin revolted against their Crusader rulers in 1104, inflicting heavy casualties against their troops. Within a few years, Ma'arrat Misrin entered the hands of the Ismailis who launched an assault from there against Crusader-held Shaizar in April 1114. However, the Ismailis were routed by the Bani Munqidh, a local Arab tribe. Ma'arat Misrin once again came under Crusader control after the town capitulated upon the approach of Baldwin II in 1119. The Burid and Artuqid rulers Toghtekin and Ilghazi besieged it the next year, prompting Baldwin II to lead a relief effort. Afterward, a peace treaty between the two factions was made, whereby Ma'arrat Misrin, Kafartab and al-Bara would remain with the Crusaders. It served as the Crusaders' camp during Alsunqur al- Bursuqi's raids in the area in early 1126 until they were forced to withdraw due to a supplies shortage. In 1129 Imad ad-Din Zengi stormed Ma'arrat Misrin's suburbs, while the Zengid governor of Aleppo, Sawar, plundered the town in 1132 before retreating to Aleppo. In 1175, Ayyubid Sultan Saladin undertook a successful campaign against the Ismailis who controlled Maarrat Misrin and its surroundings. Saladin appointed his maternal uncle, Shihab al- Din al-Hariri, as governor of the area. During the summer of 1222, the Ayyubid emir of Aleppo, al-Salih, gained control over Ma'arrat Misrin, only to exchange it for Aintab in 1227.Houtsma, 1987, pp. 58-59. In 1240, the town was invaded and sacked by the Khwarezmiyya. =Ottoman era= In the 17th century during the Ottoman rule, Ma'arat Misrin was the center of a Qadaa in the Aleppo Vilayet.Wilkins, 2010, p. 56. The town was a large village situated among sesame fields and olive groves in the late 19th century. In the early 20th century, American archaeologist Robert Garrett noted that the town's soil was \\"unusually fertile\\" and that there was an abundance of fig trees.Houtsma, 1987, p. 59. =Modern era= In the early period of French Mandate rule, Ma'arrat Misrin was the center of a nahiya (\\"sibdistrict\\") in the larger district of Aleppo. The town had a population of around 3,000 inhabitants in 1930. In 1945, Maarrat Misrin, which was under the jurisdiction of the district of Idlib, had 5,000 inhabitants.Gibb, 1960, p. 921-922. Ma'arrat Misrin serves a large market town for the surrounding rural agricultural villages. The grocers market in the city covers several blocks.Hubbard, Ben. Rebel-Held Syrian Town Struggles To Keep The Peace. Associated Press. 2012-06-25. Syrian Civil War Ma'arrat Masrin has seen violence during the ongoing Syrian Civil War which began in 2011. Small demonstrations against government corruption and the security services began in April 2011. On 12 December 2011 opposition activists claimed the Syrian Army \\"indiscriminately\\" killed eleven people in the town and nearby Kafr Yahmul. The incident began when soldiers allegedly shot dead two civilians in Ma'arrat Misrin prompting residents to block the main road leading to the villages. The army then fired randomly, resulting in eleven deaths.Syria unrest: Deadly clashes hit restive north-west. BBC News. 2011-12-13. The next day, defectors from the army attacked a convoy of security forces in the Idlib region, killing seven, according to activists.Activists: Syrian army defectors kill 7 government forces . CNN. 2011-12-13. Hours later two more residents were shot by Syrian security forces during a funeral procession for those killed the previous day. Tit-for-tat kidnappings have occurred throughout the uprising between residents of Ma'arrat Misrin and the nearby Shia Muslim towns of al-Fu'ah and Kafriya. In March 2012 the Syrian Army shelled the city, resulting in the deaths of five residents. The head of the city's eight-member rebel council negotiated an end to the fighting whereby opposition rebels would remove their checkpoints and the army would cease military operations against the town. Fighting between the two largely stopped, however, according to a Syrian military source cited by Syrian Documents, on 7 September 2012, the Syrian Army ambushed a rebel unit in Ma'arrat Misrin. More than 42 were killed.Latest Events Bulletin. Syrian Documents. 2012-09-07. In December 2012, a kidnapped NBC News team was held hostage in a chicken farm near Ma'arrat Misrin controlled by FSA-aligned rebel group North Idlib Falcons Brigade.

Fairchild was born in Crete, Nebraska. His father was Arthur Babbitt Fairchild, a descendant of Thomas Fairchild who settled in New England in 1639. He was a brother of Henry Pratt Fairchild, a sociologist and educator. Fairchild attended Doane College (AB, 1898) in Crete and Yale University (PhD, 1904). He also received an honorary LL.D. from Doane in 1929. Fairchild taught economics at Yale for many years. He was a holder of the Knox Chair of Economics. He was published widely, and his work included well received text books. Fairchild was an honorary member of the National Tax Association, an educational association of taxation experts. His primary field of study was federal taxation in the United States. In a 1920 journal article published in the American Economic Review, Fairchild proposed a restructuring of the post-war U.S. federal taxation system in light of calls for the repeal of the excess profits tax enacted during wartime. He recommended, in order to ensure a \\"reasonable revenue to the government and justice to the various classes of taxpayers\\",Fairchild 1920, p. 798. that corporations be exempt from income taxes and instead that shareholder dividends become subject to the income tax. Influence In an article about the proper level for the capital gains tax,Proper level for the capital gains tax Bruce Bartlett, a senior fellow at NCPA, cites Fairchild, :Fred Rogers Fairchild of Yale probably spoke for most economists of the day when he said, \\"the weight of economic authority supports the theory that mere growth in value of capital is not income.\\" (citing Fred Rogers Fairchild, \\"Federal Taxation of Income and Profits\\", American Economic Review, Vol. 11, No. 1, March 1921, p. 150.)

One of the oldest cities in Upper Mesopotamia, the area of Ras al-Ayn has been inhabited since at least the Neolithic age ( 8,000 BC). Later known as the ancient Aramean city of Sikkan, the Roman city of Rhesaina, and the Byzantine city of Theodosiopolis, the town was destroyed and rebuilt several times, and in medieval times was the site of fierce battles between several Muslim dynasties. With the 1921 Treaty of Ankara Ras al-Ayn became a divided city when its northern part, today's Ceylanpƒ±nar, was ceded to Turkey. With a population of 29,347 (), it is the third largest city in al-Hasakah Governorate, and the administrative center of Ras al-Ayn District. During the Syrian Civil War, the city became contested between Syrian opposition forces and People's Protection Units (YPG) from November 2012 until it was finally captured by the YPG in July 2013. It was later captured by the Turkish Armed Forces and the Syrian National Army during the 2019 Turkish offensive into north-eastern Syria,\\"Sdf Recaptures Town Ras Al Ain Pro Turkish Forces in Northern Syria\\" Middle East Eye 15 October 2019 https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/sdf-recaptures-town-ras-al-ain-pro-turkish- forces-northern- syriahttp://www.syriahr.com/en/?p=144313https://tass.com/world/1084181 bringing it under the Turkish occupation of northern Syria.  Etymology  The first mention of the town is in Akkadian during the reign of the Assyrian king Adad-nirari II (911-891 BC). The Arabic name Ras al-Ayn derives from the Akkadian and has the same meaning; \\"head of the spring\\", or idiomatically, \\"hill of the spring\\", indicating a prominent mountain formation close to a well. Jazira (Upper Mesopotamia), showing Ras al-Ayn as part of Diyar Rabi'a administrative division The ancient Greek geographer Ptolemy (d. 168) names the town Raisena. The town, as part of the Roman Empire, was called Ressaina/Resaina. Another name was Theodosiopolis, after emperor Theodosius I, who enlarged the town in 380. The 11th century Arab geographer Muhammad al- Idrisi visited the town, mentioning its name as Ras al-'Ayn, and assigning it to Diyar Rabi'a (abode of the Arab tribe Rabi'a). He also described it as a big city with plenty of water, around 300 springs from which most of al-Khabur river starts. In addition to Ras al-Ayn, medieval Arab Muslim sources refer to the town sometimes as Ain Werda. Nineteenth-century English sources refer to the town as Ras Ain, Ain Verdeh (1819), or Ras el Ain (1868). The Kurdish name also means \\"head of the spring\\" or \\"head of the fountain\\", referring to water source areas. This name is probably a modern literal translation of the ancient Semitic name. British ethnographical map from 1910 showing the name \\"Ras el Ain\\" in the red eclipse (top center). The blue color represents Arab population and yellow represents Kurds Ottoman map from 1893 showing \\"Ras al- Ain\\" in Ottoman Turkish language (ÿ±ÿ£ÿ≥ ÿßŸÑÿπŸäŸÜ) (in red circle, top center)  Geography and climate  Ras al-Ayn is located in the Upper Khabur basin in the northern Syrian region of Jazira. The Khabur, largest tributary of the Euphrates, crosses the border from Turkey near the town of Tell Halaf, about to the southwest of the city. The overground feeders, originating on the headwaters of the Karaca volcano in ≈ûanlƒ±urfa Province, usually do not carry water in the summer, even though Turkey brings in water from the Atat√ºrk reservoir to irrigate the region of Ceylanpƒ±nar. While more than 80% of the Upper Khabur's water originates in Turkey, this mostly comes as underground flow. So rather than the overground streams, it is the giant karstic springs of the Ras al-Ayn area that is considered the river's main perennial source. = Ras al-Ayn springs = Ras al-Ayn has more than 100 natural springs. The most famous spring is Nab'a al-Kebreet, a hot spring with a very high mineral content, containing calcium, lithium, and radium. = Water supply = The Allouk water pumping station, which distributes water to the Hasakah Governorate, is close to Ras al-Ayn. Since the Turkish occupation began, the water supply has been interrupted several times. Previously, the station supplied about 460,000 people in Al-Hasakah, Tell Tamer, and the Al-Hawl refugee camp, but not since the last interruption in March 2020, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.  History  = Neolithic and ancient history = The area of Ras al-Ayn was inhabited at least since the Neolithic age (c. 8.000 BC). Today's Ras al-Ayn can be traced back to a settlement existing since c. 2000 BC, which in the early 1st millennium BC became the ancient city of Sikkan, part of the Aramaean kingdom of Bit Bahiani. The archaeological site is located on the southern edge of the mound Tell Fekheriye, around which today's Ras al-Ayn is built, just a few hundred meters south of the city center. During excavations in 1979, the famous Tell Fekheriye bilingual inscription was found. The nearby town of Tell Halaf is also a former site of an Aramean city. =Classical era= In later times, the town became known as \\"Rhesaina\\", \\"Ayn Warda\\", and \\"Theodosiopolis\\", the latter named after the Byzantine emperor Theodosius I who granted the settlement city rights. The latter name was also shared with the Armenian city of Karin (modern Erzurum) making it difficult to distinguish between them. The Sasanians destroyed the city twice in 578 and 580 before rebuilding it and constructing one of the three Sassanian academies in it (the other two being Gundishapur and Ctesiphon) in it. = Medieval history = The city fell to the Arabs in 640 who confiscated parts of the city which were abandoned by their inhabitants. The Byzantines raided the city in 942 and took many prisoners. In 1129, Crusader Joscelin I managed to hold the city briefly, killing many of its Arab inhabitants. At its height the city had a West Syrian bishopric and many monasteries. The city also contained two mosques and an East Syrian church and numerous schools, baths, and gardens. Ras al-Ayn became contested between the Zengids, Ayyubids, and the Khwarazmians in the 12th and 13th centuries. It was sacked by Tamerlane at the end of the 14th century, ending its role as a major city in al-Jazira. = Ottoman history = In the 19th century a colony of Muslim Chechen refugees fleeing the Russian conquest of the Caucasus were settled in the town by the Ottoman Empire. The Ottomans also built barracks and a fort for a thousand soldiers to control and protect the refugees. During the Armenian Genocide, Ras al-Ayn was one of the major collecting points for deported Armenians. From 1915 on, 1.5 million Armenians were deported from all over Anatolia, many forced on death marches into the Syrian desert.https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/24/armenian-genocide- survivors-stories-my-dreams-cannot-mourn Approximately 80,000 Armenians, mostly women and children, were slaughtered in desert death camps near Ras al- Ayn. As well as the Deir ez-Zor Camps further south, the Ras al-Ayn Camps became \\"synonymous with Armenian suffering.\\" = Modern history = After the fall of the Ottoman Empire and the 1921 Treaty of Ankara, Ras al-Ayn became a divided city when its northern neighborhoods, today's Ceylanpƒ±nar, were ceded to Turkey. Today, the two cities are separated by a fenced border strip and the Berlin‚ÄìBaghdad Railway on the Turkish side. The only border crossing is located in the western outskirts of Ras al-Ayn. The town was first part of the French colonial empire's Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon and, from 1946, the independent state of Syria.  Civil War During the Syrian Civil War, Ras al-Ayn was engulfed by the long Battle of Ras al-Ayn. In late November 2012, rebels of al-Nusra Front and the Free Syrian Army (FSA) attacked Syrian Army positions, expelling them from the town. During the following eight months, the Kurdish-majority People's Protection Units (YPG), present from the outset, gradually entrenched its position, and eventually formed an alliance with a non-jihadist FSA faction. On 21 July 2013, this alliance expelled the jihadists after a night of heavy fighting. The town was part of Rojava for the following six years, until it was attacked and captured by the Turkish army and allied Syrian National Army during the October 2019 Turkish offensive into north-eastern Syria, in the Second Battle of Ras al-Ayn.\\"turkey-claims- capture-key-syrian-border-town\\" Al Jazeera https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/10/turkey-claims-capture-key-syrian- border-town-191012194413335.html After 11 days of clashes and siege, the Syrian Democratic Forces retreated from Ras al-Ayn as part of a ceasefire agreement.

A counterfeit watch (or replica watch) is an unauthorised copy of an authentic watch. High-end luxury watches such as Rolex, Patek Philippe and Richard Mille are frequently counterfeited and sold on city streets and online. With technological advancements, many non-luxury and inexpensive quartz watches are also commonly counterfeited. According to estimates by the Swiss Customs Service, there are some 30 to 40 million counterfeit watches put into circulation each year.Faits et chiffres, Swiss Customs Service 2005 For example, the number and value of Customs‚Äô seizures rose from CHF 400,000 and 18 seizures in 1995 to CHF 10,300,000 and 572 seizures in 2005. According to a 2012 Federation of Swiss Watches estimate, counterfeit Swiss watch sales generated $1 billion in sales per year. History Forgery of watches became a serious problem in the eighteenth century when Britain came to rival France as the leading producer of quality clocks and watches. By the middle of the century, watchmakers in Augsburg (Germany) and in various small towns in French-speaking Switzerland were producing watches falsely signed with the names of well-known English makers such as George Graham and Eardley Norton. Other, less obvious, forgeries carried imaginary names with a vaguely English sound, such as 'Samson' or 'Simpton'. In the following century Breguet became a frequent target for forgers; at the same time British makers continued to suffer, many forgeries bearing the name 'M. J. Tobias' - a mistake for a real London maker named Michael Isaac Tobias. In the 1860s, when the American watch industry was gaining strength, the Swiss industry was responsible for many imitations of Waltham watches; these, unlike most of the earlier forgeries, often imitated the appearance of the genuine article quite closely as well as borrowing the names. This practice died out in the early 1870s, as the Swiss could not compete, so surrendered the mass-market field to U.S. firms and focused on branding high end status symbols. Modern infringers Rolex counterfeits are unauthorised replicas of Rolex watches. Rolex watches have often been more susceptible to counterfeiting compared to other luxury watches, due their brand enjoying the highest worldwide awareness and ubiquity of their design trademarks (for instance, the Rolex Submariner has inspired plenty of imitations from both higher-end and lower-end legitimate watch makers). Counterfeit Rolex watches commonly retail anywhere from $5 to upwards of $1,000; the latter for high-end replicas with portions fabricated from solid karat gold (although most gold Rolex fakes utilize gold electroplating). Such watches are known by several nicknames such as Fauxlex.Case Studies , Fake Rolex Facts, Retrieved on 2007-05-12. The fake Rolex trade has become segmented and the products marketed using glossy color brochures and catalogues containing counterfeited wares produced in China and offered for sale to retail vendors throughout Asia. There has been an \\"open market\\" for counterfeit watches along Canal Street in Manhattan, New York City for over 20 years. During the 80s and 90s, David Thai, the leader of the infamous Born to Kill gang was well known to have run a counterfeit watch operation on Canal Street in which he was able to profit at least $13 million in 1988 alone from the sales of counterfeit Rolex watches. Replica watches are frequently sold from street stands in districts catering to tourists, or from Internet websites (mostly Asian). The auction website eBay was previously known to have many listings for fake watches. Search engines have been increasingly pressured to remove search results of websites that sell fakes. Furthermore, many expensive brands do not sanction any online sales, and instruct customers to only buy watches from authorized retailers.https://www.forbes.com/sites/arieladams/2013/05/30/the-truth-about- replica-watches/2/#5d26a1cd6e75 Swiss Customs estimates that 40% of counterfeit watches come from China,Faits et chiffres, Swiss Customs Service 2006 at page 32 but counterfeits are produced elsewhere, even in the US. EU figures show that at least 54% of fakes seized in 2004 originated in China.Cost of Piracy , manufacturingtalk.com, 2007-02-06, Retrieved 2014-12-22. The Swiss Customs Service is obliged to confiscate and destroy such goods to prevent re-sale. While there are some exceptions, counterfeit jewellery is confiscated in all cases.Importation de bijoux et de montres pour usage en propre, Info Douane, Administration f√©d√©rale des douanes, Berne, January 2005, at page 1. Types of counterfeits Trademark violations: infringing on the rightfully owned trademarks, hallmarks, symbols and any other distinctive signs of a watch brand, with or without complete trade-dress or design violation. This extends to other false indications and or markings in violation of any law, or official agreement. Typical noted examples would include \\"Swiss Made\\", \\"Water Resistant\\", \\"Shock Resistant\\", false precious metal or any other \\"noble metal\\" indications. Trade-dress or design violations: the second group involves counterfeit watches designed to resemble the original (a trade dress violation). Some high-priced counterfeit watches are produced from inferior materials and have golden parts and leather straps.See Esercizio v.

The hand on the left sub-dial has fallen off. A common myth states that a genuine watch can be discerned from a fake by the fluid movement of the sweep hand. This is because many counterfeited watches use inexpensive crystal quartz movements which produces the start/stop once per second sweep. Observed closely, one will see that even a true Rolex movement is not a perfectly smooth sweep, but is actually eight movements per second (or 28,800 per hour) in some models or around 21,000 vph. in other models. The only mechanical watches that have a second hand that moves across the dial in a truly uninterrupted sweep are the Seiko Spring Drive. Nonetheless, some of the counterfeits have automatic movements (genuine or imitation), and Rolex has produced a few models with quartz movements such as the OysterQuartz which produces the distinct quartz movement \\"ticks\\".The Rolex Report, 4th ed. =Hallmarks= According to the Swiss Customs Service, counterfeit watches can be made in such a manner as to require special equipment to confirm near authenticity. A high price is not a guarantee of authenticity. Indications of fineness do not necessarily indicate authenticity. Hallmarks can be forged, and may induce a buyer to believe a piece is made of real gold when it may only be made of a cheap metal plated in gold.See also, Swiss Hallmarks on Gold Watchcases, NAWCC Bulletin, , December 2005, vol. 47, no. 6, pp. 686-699 [14 pages]. =Frankenwatches= High quality replicas are sometimes modified by collectors and amateur horologists with genuine parts, such as movements, dials, hands, and bracelets, and are known as \\"frankenwatches\\". It is in fact possible for a frankenwatch to be made entirely from genuine parts. eBay and other Internet websites have provided the means to buy or sell these parts, which were originally supposed to be after-market spare parts for repair. Some have retrofitted a rare limited-edition dial on a lesser/common version of the same line of watches, and often an original stainless steel watch is disassembled so its dial and movement is placed in an after-market solid gold case. These are difficult to trace, since the watch manufacturer's serial numbers are engraved only in watch case. =Counterfeit digital watches= Many low-priced digital watches has also been counterfeited in a similar fashion to luxury watches. It is primarily distinguished by its lower build quality than the original and are significantly less accurate. Examples of commonly counterfeited digital watches are popular Casio watch models such as F-91W and various G-Shock models. Counterfeit versus homage A homage watch is distinct to counterfeits, as it is a legal replica of an authentic watch. These are timepieces designed to be as similar as possible to iconic watches while usually of high quality while avoiding the use of trademarked names, logos or movements. Homages are generally marketed as a more affordable alternative to an equivalent high-end watch of a similar design, although low-end homages of less expensive watches has also been produced. Most watch manufacturers offer homage models of varying price tags and designs.

It exports produce from these orchards as well as vegetables. Agriculture is sustained by the large number of springs in Salqin. History According to legends, the city was the summer residence of Seleucus I, hence the naming. An inscription, found on a stone between two cypress trees in the village, dates its foundation to 98 BC. Salqin was mentioned by medieval Muslim historian Izz al-Din ibn Shaddad al-Halabi as the site of one of 22 abandoned or ruined fortresses in the Aleppo region, likely disbanded or destroyed during the Mongol invasions of Syria in the mid to late 13th century.

Crown College lost its educational accreditation on July 31, 2007 and it suspended operations on August 10, 2007.Public Notice of ACCSCT's Revocation of Crown College's Accreditation Consumer Information , Washington Higher Education Coordinating Board, Authorization and Evaluation (accessed December 7, 2007)  History  The institution was originally Crown School of Hair Design in Everett, Washington and was not affiliated with its present ownership. Killebrew/Dalton, Inc. purchased the school on January 5, 1990 and changed the name of the school to Crown Academy. Crown Academy kept its National Association of Trade and Technical Schools (NATTS) accreditation and continued to be licensed by the Washington State Workforce Training and Education Coordinating Board. In six months, after the last of the beauty school students left, Crown Academy began a correctional officers training program and moved to Tacoma in 1991. The school's name was changed to Crown College in 1994 and it began offering associate of science degrees in criminal justice. One year later it added a court operations specialist program which evolved into paralegal studies. A few years later Crown offered a bachelor and associate degree in public administration. In 2003, John Wabel became the sole shareholder of Killebrew/Dalton, Inc. and, soon after, Crown College began offering an associate degree and bachelor's degree in business administration.Deposition of John Wabel, pgs. 10 to 21, 53 Crown College offered most of its classes through distance education. It employs an online technology called the Cloudroom which is a \\"live interactive classroom environment\\". It also features an accelerated program where students can complete an Associate of Science in approximately 14 months and a Bachelor of Science in approximately 28 months.  Accreditation  Until July 31, 2007, Crown College was accredited by the Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges of Technology (ACCSCT), which superseded the NATTS in 1993. Crown College had been on probation with ACCSCT intermittently since 2005.ACCSCT Schools on Probation as of March 12, 2007 The ACCSCT is a national accrediting agency which accredits 800 post-secondary schools and colleges serving over 240,000 students. These schools teach a wide range of vocational, career and technical subjects which include massage, acupuncture, beauty, pet grooming, cooking, art, locksmithing, gemology, detective investigation, refrigeration, helicopter flight training, mechanical and aviation maintenance to name a few.  Closure  On July 31, 2007, the ACCSCT stripped the school of its accreditation, resulting in the school having to close, until such time it can regain accreditation. According to the Associate Director of the ACCSCT, Crown was stripped of its accreditation because it failed to place 70% of its graduates in the field they had studied for.Shuttered College Says It Wants to Help Students Left in the Lurch, The Tacoma News Tribune, Karen Hucks, August 16, 2007 Arrangements were made for current students to complete their studies through Herzing College Online. In order to offer degrees in Washington State again, Crown will need to seek approval from the Higher Education Coordinating Board since the loss of ACCSCT accreditation means Crown would no longer be exempt from HECB oversight.  Federal criminal indictment  On August 14, 2007 the Department of Education, Office of Inspector General, served a search warrant on Crown College and seized documents and computer files connected with an alleged case of financial aid fraud, conspiracy to defraud and bank fraud by senior employees of Crown College. These employees and some of their \\"significant\\" others, were under the impression that Crown College would close and allegedly falsified loan applications and received financial aid though they did not attend Crown. They allegedly figured that the loans would be discharged when the school closed. However, when the school did not close immediately, they allegedly falsified attendance records commensurate with the loans. On May 13, 2010, four former officers of the defunct school were indicted by a federal grand jury on charges of mail and financial aid fraud. The charges stem from the August 14, 2007 investigation. The indictment named four former officers of the school: Sheila Mullineaux, Vice President; Jesica McMullin, Admissions Director and Registrar; Misty Lee, Financial Aid Director; and Jennifer Byers, Fiscal Manager and Bookkeeper. On July 14, 2011 Jesica McMullin and Jennifer Byers were each found guilty of 7 counts of mail fraud and 1 count of financial aid fraud. Misty Lee plead guilty to similar charges, testifying to the others' involvement in the fraud. McMullin and Byers are scheduled to be sentenced in October 2011.  Degrees offered Crown College offered Associate of Science degrees in Paralegal Studies, Criminal Justice and Business Administration and Bachelor of Science degrees in Business and Public Administration. These degrees were conveyed under the authority and auspices of the ACCSCT since Crown College is exempt from oversight by the Washington State Higher Education Coordinating Board (HECB).HECB website showing list of \\"continuously exempt institutions which oversees most degree granting colleges and universities in the state. However, since the ACCSCT no longer accredits Crown College, it is no longer authorized to offer degrees in Washington state.  Lawsuits  Crown College's degrees and credits, like those of many for profit schools accredited by national accreditors, are presently not accepted for transfer or recognized by many institutions that have regional accreditation.Crown College Sued By Students King5.com March 21, 2005 Types of Accreditation, Education USA website In 2000, 2004 and again in 2005, Crown College was sued, not because their credits do not transfer, but because they allegedly misrepresented that fact to prospective students. Other nationally accredited schools, notably Florida Metropolitan University, have been accused of making similar misrepresentations.Bad Education Orlando Weekly, April 14, 2005, by Jeffrey C. Billman Eleven students participated in the three lawsuits; all alleged that Crown College's admission representatives and staff misrepresented the transferability of their credits to regionally accredited schools such as Gonzaga University, University of Washington, and Seattle University. Each of these students claimed that their decision to attend Crown College was based on these alleged misrepresentations and that Crown College staff made them with the intent of inducing the students to enroll. Lola Jackson and three former students sued Crown College in 2000. Crown College settled that case for a confidential sum before trial in 2004. In 2004 Crown College was sued by Latisha GonzalezGonzalez v. Killebrew/Dalton, Inc. First Amended Complaint, Case No. 04-2-09023-2, Pierce County Superior Court and then in early 2005 by Joanne Black (a class action lawsuit that was never certified) and five other plaintiffs. The Black lawsuit also alleged that Crown College's sound system, faculty and curriculum was deficient and that their placement claims were inflated. In the Gonzalez and Black cases Executive Director John Wabel claimed that Crown College's enrollment agreement and catalog clearly stated that they could not assure the transferability of their credits and claimed that no admissions representative made such an assurance. These two lawsuits were widely reported in the local and national news. In January 2006, the Gonzalez case was tried and ten former students, from 1998 to the present, came forward to testify that Crown College admissions representatives had also misrepresented the transferability of credits to them. After a seven-day trial, the jury found that Crown College had violated the Washington State Consumer Protection Act which outlaws deceptive practices in business. The judge later assessed a total of $77,000 including attorney fees and punitive damages per the statute and she issued an injunction mandating that Crown College have each student sign a form with specific language concerning the transferability of their credits and also include in all their advertising that they were accredited by the ACCSCT. The injunction was later lifted. In August 2006, Crown College settled the Black case for $87,000, divided amongst the six plaintiffs, without admitting liability. Crown's enrollment agreements now require that prospective students waive their right to sue the school if their credits are not accepted for transfer by other schools.

Early life and career  He was born in Tbilisi, Georgian SSR, in 1921. His family, once a princely house, was heavily repressed during Joseph Stalin's Great Purge: his father was shot in 1938 and mother sent to a Gulag camp. During World War II, he was recruited into the Red Army, but was soon sacked due to his family background. Subsequently, he became involved in anti-Soviet activities, being a member of the underground political organization Tetri Giorgi. In April 1944, he was arrested on coup plot charges and sentenced to twenty-five years of imprisonment in Siberia. After fifteen years in prison, three prison escapes, and two death sentences, he was ultimately rehabilitated in 1959 and began his literary career in his late thirties with short stories including The Road (·Éí·Éñ·Éê, 1962), My Ragger Uncle (·É©·Éî·Éõ·Éò ·Éõ·Éî·ÉØ·É¶·Éê·Éú·Éî ·Éë·Éò·É´·Éê, 1963), The Bull‚Äôs Confession (·ÉÆ·Éê·É†·Éò·É° ·Éê·É¶·É°·Éê·É†·Éî·Éë·Éê, 1964) and Giorgi Burduli (·Éí·Éò·Éù·É†·Éí·Éò ·Éë·É£·É†·Éì·É£·Éö·Éò, 1965).Mikaberidze, Alexander, ed. (2007). \\"Amirejibi, Chabua\\". Dictionary of Georgian National Biography . Retrieved on 2007-04-09.  Fame  Amirejibi's most famous novel and one of the best works in modern Georgian literature, Data Tutashkhia (·Éì·Éê·Éó·Éê ·Éó·É£·Éó·Éê·É®·ÉÆ·Éò·Éê, 1971-5), achieved sensational success for the magazine Tsiskari and fame for the writer himself. Conceived while in Amirejibi‚Äôs years in prison, it was only through the intervention of the contemporary Georgian Communist Party chief Eduard Shevardnadze that this substantial novel of over 700 pages, passed the Soviet censors and got published. The novel is a story of a Georgian outlaw of the Imperial Russian period, a very popular theme in Georgian literature, and combines thrilling escapades with Dostoevskian dealings with the fate of an individual and national soul. The story is narrated by a Russian gendarme, Count Szeged, who frequently passes the story-telling on to other characters. The novel follows the life of outlaw Data Tutashkhia, who spends years eluding capture by the Tsarist police. They are led by Data's cousin, his detached and imperturbable double, Mushni Zarandia.Rayfield, Donald (2000), The Literature of Georgia: A History: 2nd edition, pp. 282-3. Routledge, . The book, and the feature film based on it, turned Data Tutaskhia into an iconic hero, widely popular in Georgia.  Later career  Amirejibi hailed the newly independent Georgia, and was elected to its Parliament from 1992 to 1995. In 1992, he was rewarded with the prestigious Shota Rustaveli State Prize. However, the tragic years of civil war and the death of his eldest son Irakli in the War in Abkhazia in 1992 heavily affected the writer. Therefore, it came to a real surprise when Amirejibi published, in 1995, his next major novel, Gora Mborgali (·Éí·Éù·É†·Éê ·Éõ·Éë·Éù·É†·Éí·Éê·Éö·Éò, literally meaning \\"frenzied\\" or \\"infuriating\\"), begun in 1978, and based on the author‚Äôs experiences in Soviet prisons. His most recent work, George the Brilliant (·Éí·Éò·Éù·É†·Éí·Éò ·Éë·É†·É¨·Éß·Éò·Éú·Éï·Éê·Éö·Éî), a historical novel about the 14th-century Georgian king preaching national pride, appeared in 2005.Rayfield, Donald, \\"Georgian literature.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. 2008.

He was a fellow of Collegio Borromeo and obtained his degree with honors in Medicine in 1976 from the University of Pavia where he specialized in Pediatrics and Infectious Diseases. Career Since 1980 he focussed on human immunology, first at the University of Genoa, at the Basel Institute for Immunology and, from 1999 at the Institute for Research in Biomedicine in Bellinzona, of which he is the founding Director. He has been teaching Immunology at the University of Genoa and the University of Siena and since 2009 is professor of Human Immunology at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich. Since January 2014 he had been appointed President of the Fondazione Regionale per la Ricerca Biomedica of the Region Lombardy, Italy. Research His research has covered several aspects of human immunology. Antigen processing and presentation. Using clones of antigen-specific B and T cells, he demonstrated that B cells efficiently capture, via membrane immunoglobulins, the specific antigen, which is then internalized, and processed into peptides, which are presented to T helper cells in an extraordinarily efficient manner (1). This study uncovered a critical step in the process of T-B cell cooperation that is essential for high affinity antibody production and represents the basis for the development of glycoconjugate vaccines. In subsequent studies, he showed that antigens can be effectively targeted to surface molecules other than membrane immunoglobulins (2, 3), a finding that has contributed to current strategies of antigen targeting to improve vaccination. Finally, he addressed the role of HLA class II molecules as receptors for self versus foreign peptides and showed how inflammatory stimuli can enhance the loading of pathogen-derived peptides on newly synthesized HLA Class II molecules so as to favour host- protective immunity (4, 7). Monocyte-derived dendritic cells: In the early Nineties the analysis of dendritic cells was impeded because of their low number and the inability to generate them at will for detailed study of their function. In collaboration with his colleague Federica Sallusto, Lanzavecchia helped solve this fundamental problem when he discovered that human monocytes could be induced to differentiate in vitro into ‚Äúimmature‚Äù dendritic cells that resemble those that function as sentinels in peripheral tissues (8), contributing to the rapid advancement of the field in the late nineties and paving the way for the use of antigen-loaded dendritic cells as vaccines. Using these dendritic cells he studied in detail the cell biology of the maturation process and identified the microbial and endogenous stimuli that trigger dendritic cell maturation (7, 10). Immunological memory: While the property of memory in the adaptive system had been known for decades, it was Lanzavecchia's laboratory that described in humans a fundamental division of memory T cells into two major subtypes, central memory and effector memory T cells, which play distinct roles in secondary immune responses (11). He proposed that central memory T cells, which migrate to secondary lymphoid organs, represent memory stem cells responsible for recall responses and the long-term maintenance of the memory pool. In contrast, effector memory T cells that home to peripheral tissues provide immediate protection but have shorter lifespan and reconstitution capacity. Based on original studies on the roles of T cell receptor triggering, sustained signalling and costimulation in T cell activation (12‚Äì14), Lanzavecchia also proposed a progressive model of T cell differentiation to explain the generation of central and effector memory T cells within a single clone of antigen-primed T cells (15). The discovery of central memory and effector memory cells has been particularly relevant in the context of T cell-based vaccines that aim at inducing durable and protective immunity. Human monoclonal antibodies and vaccine design: Taking advantage of his studies on human memory B cells (16), Lanazvecchia developed novel and robust methods to immortalize human memory B cells and to preserve single plasma cells in culture (17, 18). He used these methods to interrogate the memory repertoire of selected individuals to isolate monoclonal antibodies with unique specificities. Several examples illustrate the power and utility of this approach. Neutralizing antibodies were isolated against SARS, cytomegalovirus, avian influenza and dengue virus. Unusually potent antibodies that neutralize human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) were isolated and their epitopes mapped to a pentameric glycoprotein complex, which is currently tested as a candidate vaccine. The most striking examples are antibodies with exceptional breadth, being able to neutralize all influenza A viruses and even four different paramyxoviruses (18,19). The methods to isolate human monoclonal antibodies developed by Lanzavecchia have realized a long-sought goal: the full exploitation of the human immune response for serotherapy and vaccine design. These fully human monoclonal antibodies can be used not only as drugs for prophylaxis and therapy of infectious diseases, but also as tools to identify vaccine candidates, a process defined as ‚Äúanalytic vaccinology‚Äù (20). The present work in Lanzavecchia's laboratory addresses fundamental issues on the role of somatic mutations and the pathways leading to the development of broadly neutralizing antibodies and explores the relationship between infection and autoimmunity (21). =Awards and honors= * Italian Society for Immunology (GCI, SIICA), since 1980 * European Molecular Biology Organisation (EMBO), since 1988 * The Henry Kunkel Society * Member of the Royal College of Physicians * Schweizerische Gesellschaft f√ºr Allergologie und Immunologie, honorary member * American Society for Immunology, honorary member * National Academy of Sciences (NAS), since 2016. * Swiss Academy of Medical Sciences, honorary member since 2016 * Louis-Jeantet Prize for Medicine, 2018Louis- Jeantet Prize =Editorial activities= * Science: board of reviewing editors 1997‚Äì2005 * European Journal of Immunology: executive committee member * Journal of Experimental Medicine: advisory editor =Patents= * Lanzavecchia A: Potent T Cell Modulating Molecules US2004/0162411 A1 * Lanzavecchia A: Monoclonal antibody production by EBV transformation of B cells WO2004076677 =Publications= Lanzavecchia has a total of 272 publications in peer reviewed scientific journals, with a total of 63,405 citations (h-index=109).

It is the lower of a pair of twin peaks (), the other being Castor, named after the Gemini twins of Roman mythology. Pollux' peak is at an elevation of . It is separated from Castor by a pass at , named Passo di Verra in Italian, Col de Verra in French and Zwillingsjoch in German. The first ascent was by Jules Jacot from Geneva with guides Josef-Marie Perren and Peter Taugwalder (father) on August 1 (the Swiss national day) 1864. Their route was via the Schwarztor, a pass first crossed by John Ball and Gabriel Zumtaugwald in 1845. The impressive north ridge was first climbed by Captain John Percy Farrar (a future President of the Alpine Club) and Wylie Lloyd with guide Josef Pollinger of St. Niklaus in the canton Valais on 18 August 1893. Ascents are usually made from the Refuge Ottorino Mezzalama (3,036 m), the Monte Rosa hut (2,795 m); if traversing the peaks via Pollux's north ridge, PD+, the Refuge Quintino Sella au F√©lik (3,585 m), and the Rossi-Volante bivouac hut (3,850 m). The first winter and ski ascent of Pollux was by Dr Alfred von Martin and Karl Planck on 7 March 1913. There are also a pair of summits named Pollux and Castor in Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, USA. Located in the Absaroka Range, Pollux is 3,373 m, 65 m higher than its twin.

It is bred for dressage, for show-jumping and for three-day eventing. It is one of three Belgian warmblood breeds or stud-books, the others being the Zangersheide and the Belgian Sport Horse ‚Äì to which it is closely similar. History Horse breeders in the Netherlands, Germany, and France had been producing elegant saddle horses for hundreds of years. However, because the Belgian government was concerned about protecting the bloodlines of the Brabant (Belgian draft horse), it was not until the 1950s that breeders in Belgium were allowed to breed lighter saddle horses. The foundation stock of the Belgian Warmblood included jumping horses from France and the Netherlands, as well as Hanoverians and Holsteiners from Germany. The first stallion show for riding horses in Belgium took place, illegally, in 1953; the BWP was founded in 1955. Without native riding horses or all-purpose heavy warmbloods, Belgian breeders had to import stallions and mares. Over the course of 50 years, the BWP accrued a mare base of over 3,500 broodmares and produced a significant number of international-quality show jumpers. In 2010, the BWP was ranked 4th in the FEI/WBFSH International Show Jumping standings, below only the KWPN-Dutch Warmblood, Selle Fran√ßais and Holsteiner studbooks. Breed characteristics As a warmblood horse, the Belgian Warmblood is characterized not by uniformity of coat color, appearance or pedigree chart, but by uniformity of purpose. Like other warmbloods, Belgian Warmblood breeding horses are subjected to rigorous studbook selection. The studbook brand, which features a \\"pinwheel\\" of horse heads, is given to all Belgian Warmbloods The most reliable way to positively identify a Belgian Warmblood is by the brand on the left thigh. Belgian Warmblood foals receive this brand during their foal inspection, when they are given a passport and deemed free of obvious defects. Between the ages of three and four years old, Belgian Warmblood stallions are presented to a jury in a \\"Hengstenkeuring\\" or stallion licensing test. The licensing test consists of a veterinary inspection, subjective evaluation of the stallion's conformation and jumping ability without a rider, and evaluation of the stallion's qualities under saddle. Stallions that do not achieve the desired marks in the licensing test are not eligible for the studbook. To retain status in the studbook, stallions must participate in competitions for young show jumping horses called the \\"Classic Cycle\\". Mares take part in similar conformational evaluations, however judgement of a mare's qualities as a riding horse are elective. Belgian Warmbloods range in size and substance, but the ideal size for a stallion is between 16 and 17 hands high at the withers. Mares are not eligible for breeding rights unless they exceed 15.1 hands high. In type, the Belgian Warmblood is similar to the Holsteiner, Selle Fran√ßais, Dutch Warmblood, and Hanoverian, and less like the Trakehner.  Use  Denis Lynch and Nabab's Son, Dublin Horse Show 2008 Over the past 20 years, research has supported observations regarding the high heritability of jumping ability compared with that of dressage-quality gaits.

The tower dates back to the late 15th century, and it was a stronghold of a branch of the MacCulloch family. The present form of the castle dates from rebuilding in the 16th or 17th century, and in the early 2000s it was restored from a roofless state to residential use. Barholm The tower is sometimes identified with the fictional Ellangowan, in Sir Walter Scott's Guy Mannering. History The main block of the castle dates at least in part to the 15th century. A charter of 1541 was signed at Barholm. The stair tower is a late 16th-century addition, with a date stone of 1575, at which time the main block was rebuilt with a higher wall-head, and new parapet walk. A walled-up door in the east wall of the main block suggests a redesign of the accommodation. Barholm was a stronghold of the McCullochs, who had owned the property since 1510. A strongly Protestant family, they feuded with the Catholic Browns of Carsluith Castle, only two miles to the north-west. Protestant preacher John Knox is said to have stayed here. In 1579 John Brown of Carsluith was charged to appear in court for the murder of McCulloch of Barholm, and was fined for his non-appearance. Major John McCulloch of Barholm was executed for his part in the Pentland Rising and the battle of Rullion Green in 1666. The tower was replaced as the McCulloch residence in the late 18th century when Robert Adam designed the classical Barholm House for the family near Creetown to the north. This house was destroyed by fire in the 1950s, by which time the tower had long since fallen into disrepair. Single-storey farm outbuildings had also been added on to the north of the tower. From 2003, following a grant from Historic Scotland, the tower was re-roofed and restored as a private house. Archaeological excavations were carried out before and during the works, between 2000 and 2005. Architects for the project were Peter Drummond and later Patrick Lorimer of ARP Lorimer and Associates, and the restoration work - completed in 2006 - was carried out by Cumming & Co., a Perth-based specialist restoration company. Since the restoration the tower house is no longer a scheduled monument, though it remains a category A listed building. The castle The main block of the L-plan tower is of three storeys and a garret, with a vaulted basement at the lower level. The floor above was the hall, with a broad, hooded fireplace. The second floor was divided into two rooms. The small stair wing is a storey higher, with a caphouse at the top reached by a corbelled stair turret in the re-entrant angle. Narrow parapet walks run on the north and south walls. The main stair is a broad spiral which occupies the whole of the lower stair wing. The doors and windows have moulded surrounds, with a cable moulding, human faces and a grotesque head carved over the arched main door.

It is associated with hyperextensible skin and hypermobility of joints, however symptoms vary depending on the person. Because ATS is so rare, not much is known about the disease. Signs and symptoms Among the signs and symptoms demonstrated, by this condition are the following: * Arachnodactyly * Congenital diaphragmatic hernia * Mental dysfunction * Keratoconus * Aortic regurgitation * Blepharophimosis Genetics Chr 20 Arterial tortuosity syndrome exhibits autosomal recessive inheritance, and the responsible gene is located at chromosome 20q13. The gene associated with arterial tortuosity syndrome is SLC2A10 and has no less than 23 mutations in those individuals found to have the aforementioned condition. Pathophysiology 160 px The mechanism of this condition is apparently controlled by(or due to) the SLC2A10 gene.update 2014 The molecular genetic pathogenesis finds that SLC2A10 encodes GLUT10(in nuclear membrane, or the endoplasmic reticulum, the later of which GLUT10 transports DHA into).Clinically speaking, according to one review, the condition of tortuosity is seen more with the advance of age. Diagnosis In terms of the diagnosis of arterial tortuosity syndrome can be done via genetic testing, as well as the following listed below: * CT * MRI * Echocardiogram * Physical exam(for specific characteristics) Treatment The treatment of arterial tortuosity syndrome entails possible surgery for aortic aneurysms, as well as, follow ups which should consist of EGC.

Suga committed suicide five days after being taken prisoner by Australian forces in September 1945. Early life Suga was born in Hiroshima, the first son in his family. Although the family held Buddhist beliefs, his younger brother Giichi converted to Christianity and became a Protestant missionary: he worked at churches in Manchuria, Vancouver Island, and Chicago and became the headmaster of YMCA in Tokyo. As a youngster, Suga attended the services at the Alliance Church of Hiroshima which was started by a Danish priest. Hudson Southwell, an Australian missionary interned in Borneo, later wrote: \\"During our time in the internment camp, Colonel Suga had often come into the church services in the women's section and sat near the back. Once he told Winsome [Southwell's wife] directly, 'I'm a Christian.' This was a startling admission for a Japanese officer to make to a prisoner during wartime.\\"Southwell 165 Suga graduated from Meido Middle School in Hiroshima and then the Imperial Japanese Army Academy in Tokyo, as a Second Lieutenant. At around this time he married a woman with the given name Teru; they were to have two sons and four daughters. Suga was an affectionate father and ensured that all of his children went to university, at a time when only five per cent of Japanese went beyond the fifth or sixth grade. He was an expert horseman and a keen practitioner of kendo. Toward the end of World War I (during which Japan was an Allied power), Suga served in Siberia, Korea, Manchuria and China. In 1924, he took early retirement as a Major, and decided to pursue a career teaching English. He sailed to the United States, leaving his family in Japan, supported by his pension. Suga studied to become a certified teacher of English as a second language, at the University of Washington in Seattle. He supported himself by taking a series of jobs, such as dish-washing, and by fishing. He was interviewed in Seattle in 1924 by William Carlson Smith as part of Smith's research on race relations, later used for his book Americans in the Making, which was published in 1939. Suga taught English as a lecturer at the Hiroshima High School of Technology (now the Department of Technology, Hiroshima University), Japan, before he was called back to active service in 1937, to serve in the Second Sino-Japanese War. He became ill with diabetes and retired again in October 1941. After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Suga volunteered for service as a prison camp commander on an advice of his younger brother,Hoshino 406-7 believing that his language skills would prove useful. He was appointed commander of all POW and internment camps in Borneo.Southwell 145-7 Borneo On Borneo there were Japanese-run internment camps at Batu Lintang, Kuching, Sarawak, Jesselton (later Kota Kinabalu), Sandakan and briefly on Labuan island.Wigmore 595 note 9 Suga was based at Batu Lintang but was often absent on business at the other camps. Suga is described in Three Came Home, an account by Agnes Newton Keith, a female civilian internee at Batu Lintang: :A little Japanese man, onetime graduate of the University of Washington, patron of the arts, recipient of World War I Allied decorations; a military man with shaven head; a sick man with diabetes who eats no sugar; a soldier who likes children; a little man with a big sword; a religious dilettante, born Shintoist and turning Catholic; a hero and a figure of ridicule; a Japanese patriot, Commander of All Prisoners of War and Internees in Borneo.Keith 205 Rosemary Beatty, an Australian who was a small child when she was interned at Batu Lintang, recalled Suga's acts of kindness to her and other children: :I suppose the thing that really sticks in my mind really is Colonel Suga coming through the gates in his car and we would sneak into it and hide, and then he would drive off and find we were there. He'd take us up to his residence and serve us coffee[,] fruit and show us magazines... He'd even give us lollies [sweets/candy] to bring back to camp.Firkins, Peter (1995) Borneo Surgeon: A Reluctant Hero, Carlisle, Western Australia: Hesperian Press. . Rosemary Beatty's surname is mis-spelled as Beattie Brutality by the guards at Batu Lintang increased when Suga was away; internees wondered whether he left instructions for this to happen or whether the juniors left in charge took advantage of his absence to further abuse the prisoners.Mackie 261 The atomic bombings in Japan at Hiroshima on 6 August 1945, followed by that of Nagasaki on 9 August, precipitated the abrupt end of the war. On 15 August 1945, Japan announced its official unconditional surrender to the Allied Powers. On 24 August, Suga officially announced to the prisoners at Batu Lintang that Japan had surrendered.Bell 113; Ooi 1998, 618; Keith 182. Although sources vary, the most likely date appears to be 24 August Suga was a broken man: he believed that his entire family had been killed in the bombing of Hiroshima.Bell 113; Keith 206, Southwell 159 In fact, his wife and three of his children survived the bombing though his sister Teru and brother-in-law Tamekichi Tanaka as well as his son Makoto were killed.Southwell 368Hoshino 405 Suga attended the official surrender of the Japanese forces in the Kuching area by their commander, Major-General Hiyoe Yamamura, on board HMAS Kapunda on 11 September 1945.Long 563; AWM photographs 041062-041071, 116168-116175 Later that day Suga officially surrendered to Brigadier Thomas Eastick, commander of Kuching Force -- a detachment from the Australian 9th Division -- at Batu Lintang camp. The following day Suga, together with several of his officers were flown to the Australian base on Labuan, to await their trials as war criminals. Suga committed suicide there on 16 September. Other officers were later tried, found guilty and executed.Ooi 1998, 667 Southwell wrote: :Now, with the end of the war, he awaited a military tribunal. His country had been destroyed; his army defeated; his family lost. And, apart from the despair in his heart, the bushido tradition, the code of the Japanese warrior, had deep roots. The fateful day came on September 16th, one week before his 60th birthday, traditionally a time when a family would gather round in celebration. Colonel Tatsuji Suga believed he had no-one to gather around; and he had no desire to see that day alone. Evaluation As Commander of all POW and civilian internee camps, Suga was legally responsible for the many atrocities that took place in these camps, including the Sandakan Death Marches. As the war closed, Suga was given multiple orders to execute all prisoners within the camp, orders which he failed to carry out. Although Keith admired some of his personal qualities and felt that he had saved the life of her husband, who was also interned in the camp, she also recorded: \\"Against this, I place the fact that all prisoners in Borneo were inexorably moving towards starvation. Prisoners of war and civilians were beaten, abused and tortured. Daily living conditions of prison camps were almost unbearable.\\" Keith added: :At Sandakan and Ranau and Brunei, North Borneo, batches of prisoners in fifties and sixties were marched out to dig their own graves, then shot or bayoneted and pushed into the graves, many before they were dead. All over Borneo hundreds and thousands of sick, weak, weary prisoners were marched on roads and paths until they fell from exhaustion, when their heads were beaten in with rifle butts and shovels, and split open with swords, and they were left to rot unburied. On one march 2,790 POWs started, and three survived ... For these black chapters in captivity Colonel Suga, commander in Borneo, must be held responsible.Keith 205-6 Another internee at Batu Lintang, Australian civil servant Ivan Quartermaine, said that by the time the 9th Division liberated the camp, the health of the prisoners was so poor they believed they had only \\"three months to live, the whole camp. We were in pretty bad shape.\\"Robert Taylor, \\"Survivor tells of Borneo hell\\" (The West Australian, April 14, 2007, p.14) After liberation, he and other prisoners sought weapons from Australian soldiers, to take revenge on Japanese personnel, but were refused. On reflection, Quartermaine said, he believed that Suga was powerless in regard to the actions of the Japanese secret police, the Kempeitai. A section of the cemetery at Batu Lintang camp. After liberation the bodies were exhumed from the cemetery and sent to Labuan for reburial in a central military cemetery there. A large number of the graves of prisoners from Batu Lintang now at Labuan are unidentified: after the Japanese surrender Suga destroyed many camp records. The cemetery in Labuan is cared for by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. In the 1950 film adaptation of Keith's book, Suga was played by Sessue Hayakawa.

Geography Loch Hourn runs inland from the Sound of Sleat, opposite the island of Skye, for 22 km (c. 14 miles) to the head of the loch at Kinloch Hourn. At the entrance, it is 5 km (3 miles) wide, becoming less than 2 km wide for much of its length, with successive narrows in the upper reaches and reducing to a 300-metre-wide basin at the head. Sometimes described as the most fjord-like of the sea lochs of northwest Scotland, it is steep-sided, with Beinn Sgritheall to the north and Ladhar Bheinn rising from the southern shore. The sea floor has been shaped by glaciation into five progressively deeper basins with relatively shallow sills; combined with the narrow and sheltered aspect of the loch and the high local rainfall, these result in an unusually wide variation of salinity and sea habitats over the length of the loch. The loch is navigable by ships as far as Barisdale Bay. Small boats can reach Kinloch Hourn, but these upper reaches are dependent on tide and subject to strong currents. All of the loch is subject to fierce and erratic winds. There is no road access to most of the shoreline. Apart from a few isolated cottages, the only community is Arnisdale, with a population of around 30. Kinloch Hourn is 36 km (22 miles) on single track road from the A87 near Invergarry. Local economy is small scale. There is a fish farm near the mouth of the loch; a few local shell fishing boats; a few jobs dependent on the surrounding shooting estates and some local income from tourism.

The Westphalian is closely affiliated with the state-owned stud farm of Warendorf, which it shares with the Rhinelander. Since World War II, the Westphalian horse has been bred to the same standard as the other German warmbloods, and they are particularly famous as Olympic- level show jumpers and dressage horses. Next to the Hanoverian, the Westphalian studbook has the largest breeding population of any warmblood in Germany. History =Warendorf= The history of the Westphalian horse is linked with the State Stud of Warendorf, which was founded in 1826 to serve both the Prussian provinces of Westphalia and Rheinland. The stud was built under the Prussian Stud Administration, which was put together by King Frederick William I in 1713 to improve horse breeding efforts in the German- speaking region. Government-owned studs, identified as \\"State\\" or \\"Principal\\" studs depending on whether the facility keeps its own herd of mares, purchase stallions that fit the needs of the surrounding region. The stud fees of state-owned stallions are low, enabling local breeders to produce high-quality horses from heavy drafts to riding horses to ponies. The first stallions to stand at Warendorf were from East Prussia, and so were similar to Trakehners of the time. These horses were riding horses with Thoroughbred blood, suitable for the courtiers to ride and use in cavalry. As the human population between the Rhine and Weser rivers grew, the demand shifted to a medium-heavy all- purpose farm horse to cope with the increase in agriculture. The noble East Prussian stallions were replaced with heavy warmbloods from Oldenburg and East Frisia. The turn of the 20th century saw the heavy warmbloods outdone in the region by the more suitable Rhenish Cold Blood. These horses were better able to pull heavy plows and artillery, and so while they were principally bred around the Wickrath State Stud, warmblood sires at Warendorf were gradually replaced by cold bloods. The revolutions in automotive and agricultural technology that these heavy horses helped make possible made them obsolete in turn. In 1957 the Wickrath State Stud was dissolved as the heavy horses fell out of favor.The stock of warmblood horses was replenished with mares and stallions from nearby Hannover, on which the modern Westphalian is based. The Federal Riding School was incorporated to the state stud in 1968. It is the site of the training and examination of nationally licensed professional riders and instructors, and is also home to the German Equestrian Olympic Committee. Warendorf also hosts stallion performance tests annually. =Westphalian studbook= The first studbook for horses in Westphalia was founded in 1888, and the following year the first evaluations of stallions and mares were carried out. These inspections became the defining characteristic of the Westphalian, as they had for other warmbloods. The breeders of the best fillies were awarded a prize or premium as an incentive to keep high-quality breeding stock in the region. Only the very best colts, the young male horses that most closely fit what the local breeders wanted in a horse, were allowed to become breeding stallions. The first performance tests were held in 1905. These performance tests meant that stallions had now to not only fit a conformational model to be used for breeding, but also had to prove their worth under saddle and in front of the plow. World War II destroyed all the old pedigree records that had been kept so carefully. The next mare evaluation wasn't held until 1946, when a new breeding aim was implemented - a riding horse. Within 30 years, this new aim was coming to fruition: the 100-day test was implemented in 1982, and a Westphalian, Ahlerich, took gold in dressage at the Los Angeles Olympics of 1984. While over the past decade, other registries have split their breeding stock into jumper-type and dressage-type, the Westphalian verband resists specialization. Instead, Westphalians are bred to be good movers with high rideability and jumping ability for a market of mostly amateurs who appreciate versatile, pleasant horses. Breed Characteristics The Westphalian excels in dressage Westphalians are bred to the same standard as the other German warmbloods and in particular exchange a great deal of genetic material with the nearby Rhinelander and Hanoverian. The standard for all German riding horses calls for an appealing, long-lined, correct riding horse with bold, expansive, elastic gaits, suitable for all types of riding due to its temperament, character, and rideability. The Westphalian's type is less refined than that of a Thoroughbred, but less coarse than that of a \\"cold blood\\". Westphalians usually stand between at the withers and weigh between 1000 and 1300 lbs. The Westphalian registry, or verband, does not discriminate on color or markings, however, colors other than black, bay, chestnut, and grey are rare. The best way to identify a Westphalian is by the brand on the left hip: a crowned shield containing the letter \\"W\\" which Westphalians receive when they are awarded their papers at a foal show. Uses Westphalians are bred to be suitable for pleasure riding and competitive in dressage and show jumping. As of September 2010, the studbook was ranked #6 worldwide in show jumping, #5 in dressage and #12 in eventing by the World Breeding Federation for Sport Horses. Olympians bearing the Westphalian brand appeared during the 1980s. The first was Ahlerich (by Angelo xx) who took individual gold in dressage at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics. At the 1988 Seoul Olympics, individual dressage gold was won by Rembrandt (by Romadour II), who with Ahlerich was on the gold-medal German dressage team, while Pikeur Pedro (by Pilot) was part of the gold-medal German jumping team that year. In 1992 Rembrandt took individual dressage gold again, while teammate Goldstern (by Weinberg) took bronze. The two horses were part of the gold-medal German dressage team in Barcelona. At the Atlanta Olympics in 1996, Goldstern and Durgo (by Degen) were both part of the gold-medal German dressage team. Most recently, Farbenfroh (by Freudentaenzer) was a member of the gold-medal German dressage team at the 2000 Sydney Olympics. Westphalian breeding has produced a number of sires very influential to sport horse breeding, including Polydor and his half brother Pilot, and Rubinstein. These families are significant for jumping and dressage respectively. Westphalians are also popular in North America in show hunter competition. Breeding Young stallion prospects - koraspirants - are presented at a number of preselection events at Wickrath in Rhineland and Muenster-Handorf in Westphalia. The preselection is a general appraisal of the quality of the colt in terms of his movement and conformation. There are no scores, but those colts which appear to fit the standard and be of breeding quality are invited to the main stallion licensing - hauptkorung - at Warendorf. Of the over 500 koraspirants presented in 2007, only a fifth were invited to the main licensing. The Westfalen All Inclusive competing in show jumping with Ludger Beerbaum at the 2008 Olympic Games. The licensing (korung) of both Rhinelander and Westphalian colts occurs at Warendorf State Stud in November. Each horse is scored on his conformation and on the straightness of his walk and trot. The breed judges look for a horse without deviations in the legs, correct angles in the hindlegs, and the overall appearance of a good riding horse. His height is measured to ensure that he meets a minimum standard, even though most warmbloods continue to grow beyond the age of 4. He is also evaluated on the expressiveness and elasticity of his walk, trot and canter, and his ability to jump while loose in a controlled, covered arena. The champion, vice-champion, and the best jumper are announced at the end of the licensing, as well as which stallions have earned the license. Many stallions change hands at the licensing during the auction that follows. About half of the colts that attended the korung were licensed in 2007. The final step to becoming an approved Westphalian breeding stallion is the performance proof. A few exceptional horses may be able to prove themselves by open competition in sport, which can take years. Stallion performance tests were developed as a more efficient method of identifying the riding qualities of a young horse. Licensed stallions are sent to a testing station for a period of 30 or 70 days, where they receive training from affiliated professionals. Over the course of the training period, the trainers and riders become well-acquainted with the young stallion's virtues and shortcomings. The scores provide insight to their aptitude for dressage, aptitude for jumping, robustness, rideability, willingness, and temperament. The 100-day test was held in Muenster-Handorf from 1982 to 2000, and has since been replaced by the 70-day version. The strict selection procedure applied to breeding stock ensures that Westphalians are generally free of congenital diseases. They are usually sound and long- lived. Controversy In the United States, Rhinelanders are sometimes represented as Westphalians to buyers. While the two studbooks have the same standard and same approval process, and share a state stud facility, they remain distinct studbooks. Sellers may be motivated by the lack of a North American counterpart to the Rhinelander verband, and potential confusion of \\"Rhinelander\\" with Zweibr√ºcker, which are registered by the \\"Rheinland-Pfalz Saar International\\" organization.

This ascent, by Edward Whymper and party in 1865, traditionally marks the end of the golden age of alpinism. The golden age of alpinism was the decade in mountaineering between Alfred Wills's ascent of the Wetterhorn in 1854Though Wills thought he had made a first ascent, the Wetterhorn had been climbed in 1844, and his was the fourth ascent. However, mountaineering became fashionable in Britain after the barrister's climb. and Edward Whymper's ascent of the Matterhorn in 1865, during which many major peaks in the Alps saw their first ascents. Prominent figures With its beginning slightly predating the formation of the Alpine Club in London in 1857, the golden age was dominated by British alpinists and their Swiss and French guides. Prominent figures of the period include Lord Francis Douglas, Paul Grohmann, Florence Crauford Grove, Charles Hudson, E. S. Kennedy, William Mathews, A. W. Moore, Leslie Stephen, Francis Fox Tuckett, John Tyndall, Horace Walker and Edward Whymper. Well-known guides of the era include Christian Almer, Jakob Anderegg, Melchior Anderegg, , Peter Bohren, Jean-Antoine Carrel, Michel Croz, Ulrich Kaufmann and Johannes Zumtaugwald. Lucy Walker, sister of Horace, attained some notable firsts during the period, including the first ascent of the Balmhorn (1864), and later several first female ascents. In the early years of the \\"golden age\\", scientific pursuits were intermixed with the sport. More often than not, the mountaineers carried a variety of instruments up the mountain with them to be used for scientific observations. The physicist John Tyndall was the most prominent of the scientists. Among the non-scientist mountaineers, the literary critic Leslie Stephen was the most prominent. In the later years of the \\"golden age\\", the non-scientist pure sportsmen came to dominate the London-based Alpine Club and alpine mountaineering overall.Claire Eliane Engel (1950), A History of Mountaineering in the Alps, chapter VII.

It is a member of Airbus Defence and Space's Eurostar family. It utilises a chemical, bi-propellant propulsion system for orbit raising and on-station manoeuvres with an optional plasma propulsion system (PPS). The PPS harnesses the Newtonian effect as a result of the ionisation of xenon gas employed by the use of Hall effect plasma thrusters. This system is most commonly used for North-South station-keeping. The E3000 was the first commercial satellite family to use lithium-ion batteries rather than the older nickel-based technologies for power supply during eclipses. The E3000 bus can be modified extensively to meet customer requirements, but most of the E3000 satellites have a launch mass of between , and solar arrays between providing between nine and sixteen kilowatts at end of life. They tend to feature between 50 and 90 transponders, most often in the and C band. There have been 52 satellites built around the E3000 platform including ANASIS 2, Hispasat's Amazonas 1 and 2, Arabsat 5A, 5B, and 5C, Astra 1M, 1N, 2E, 2F, 2G, 3B and 5B, Eutelsat's W3A and Hot Bird 8-10, Intelsat 10-02, KaSat, Atlantic Bird 7, W5A Telesat's Anik F1R, Anik F3 and Nimiq 4, Skynet 5A-C and the Inmarsat 4 series of satellites. Each of the three Inmarsat 4 in service has a large deployable reflector as the main antenna. In March 2015 Airbus Defence and Space received a delivery of new 3D printed brackets for mounting Telemetry and Tele-Command antennas, being the first space-qualified 3D printed component of its kind. Also in March, Airbus signed a contract with Snecma for 5-kilowatt PPS5000 Hall effect thrusters for the E3000 Electric Orbit Raising variant of the satellite bus.
