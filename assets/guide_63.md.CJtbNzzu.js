Early life and career Mellanby was born on August 22, 1934 in Hamilton, Ontario, but grew up in Essex County, Ontario where his father, Edgar worked as a newspaper editor for The Windsor Star. After graduating from high school in Windsor, he attended Wayne State University in nearby Detroit, Michigan where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in communications in 1958. He also played professional baseball during his years at college. He found his first job at CKLW-TV in Windsor, Ontario, first as a prop assistant, and later as a stagehand, cameraman and floor manager. Hockey Night in Canada In 1959, he accepted a job as a cameraman at WXYZ-TV in Detroit, and the following year he moved to Chicago to become a sports producer at WGN-TV in Chicago, before returning to Canada to work at CFCF-TV (CTV) in Montreal in 1961 where he produced sports, including the NHL beginning in 1963. He joined the Canadian Sports Network (CSN) in 1966 to be the producer for their Hockey Night in Canada in broadcasts; he would remain with them for 19 years as executive producer, hiring sports commentators including Ron MacLean, Dick Irvin Jr., Jim Robson, Bob Cole, Dave Hodge, Dan Kelly, Don Cherry and Howie Meeker. During his time with Hockey Night in Canada, he oversaw the inclusion of many components of the modern hockey broadcast, including slow motion replay, as well as microphone and camera setups throughout the rink enhance the viewer experience. Olympic Games He was also involved in the production of Olympic Winter Games hockey broadcasts across Canada, starting with the 1976 Winter Olympics up to the 1994 Winter Olympics, was a member of the productions teams for Summer Olympics in 1992 and 1996. For the 1988 Winter Olympics held in Calgary, Alberta, Mellanby was the executive producer of the Canadian Television Network Host Broadcaster (CTV HB). He oversaw a production which featured a television lens identified by Maclean's as \\"the world‚Äôs longest\\", for coverage of ski jumping, cameras mounted on rolling tracks and on athletes themselves, as well as four high speed cameras to capture slow motion footage. An extensive setup of microphones throughout outdoor event courses and indoor venues was also used to capture \\"natural sounds\\" for the viewing audience and fill breaks in commentary. Other work He was also involved in the broadcasts for Canadian Open tournaments in golf and tennis, the Canadian Football League, and Major League Baseball (Montreal Expos and Toronto Blue Jays). Mellanby was also the vice president of MacLaren Advertising from 1969 to 1977 and founder of Mellanby Robertson Productions (along with Brian Robertson).

She and Liang Baibo were China's first female cartoonists. Her husband was the artist .  Life and career  Yu Feng was born on July 25, 1916 in Beijing, the daughter of magistrate Yu Hua (). Her uncle was the famed writer Yu Dafu. She graduated from the Central Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing. She later studied under painter Pan Yuliang. Her cartooning career began in 1929 or 1930 with her first cartoon, an Aubrey Beardsley-influenced work, in Shanghai Manhua (\\"Shanghai Sketch\\"). In Shanghai she married fellow Shanghai Manhua artist Huang Miaozi. Their families had different political orientations and she was taller than him, but they remained married for over sixty years until her death in 2007. Throughout the 1930s, she continued to draw cartoons for magazines like the English-language Zhongguo Zhisheng (\\"Voice of China\\") and Jiuwang Ribao (\\"National Salvation Daily\\"). One example of her wartime work is the 1938 cartoon \\"Let the Gunfire of National Salvation Smash This Pair of Shackles\\", which depicts both nationalistic and gender liberation with its woman breaking the chains of shackles. In 1955, Yu Feng was deputy editor of the magazine Xin Guancha (\\"New Observer\\") when it held a fourm on the future of Chinese fashion. Yu Feng was placed in charge of a national campaign for \\"dress reform\\", focusing on matters such as economic frugality, traditional folk dress, and national identity. Beginning in the early 1940s, Yu Feng and Huang Miaozi were part of a group of artists, writers, and other cultural figures in Shanghai and Chongqing later known as \\"The Layabouts Lodge\\" (Erliu Tang ‰∫åÊµÅÂ†Ç). During the Cultural Revolution of 1966 to 1976, the members of the Layabouts Lodge were denounced and many were imprisoned. Yu Feng and Huang Miaozi were imprisoned separately for seven years. Yu Feng made paintings out of readily available materials like toilet paper, soap, and candy wrappers. Both artists were politically rehabilitated after the Cultural Revolution and continued to exhibit art in China and throughout the world. After the Tiananmen Square Massacre in 1989, Yu Feng and Huang Miaozi moved to Brisbane and became Australian citizens, but the couple later returned to China. Yu Feng died in 2007.

Cameron is the Chair of the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and American Society for Microbiology.  Early life and education  Cameron had planned to study medicine at university, but after volunteering in hospitals he realised that he did not want to become a medical doctor. He studied chemistry at Howard University and graduated in 1987. During his undergraduate research he noticed that physicians were not ready to deal with viruses. The viruses that Cameron studied included the rhinovirus, the common cold and coxsackievirus. Cameron moved to Case Western Reserve University for his doctoral studies, which he completed in 1993. He remained at Case Western as a postdoctoral researcher, before being appointed a National Institutes of Health fellow at Pennsylvania State University (Penn State).  Research and career  In 1997 Cameron joined the faculty at Penn State. He was awarded a Howard Temin Award and set up a research group working on poliovirus polymerase. He was made the Louis Martarno Associate Professor in 2002. In 2006 Cameron was promoted to the Paul Berg Chair in Biochemistry. Cameron was appointed the Eberly Chair in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at Penn State in 2013. His research considers RNA virus infections. Cameron developed lethal mutagenesis; an alternative mechanism of action of ribavirin that renders genes unable to function. He has pioneered the use of lethal mutagenesis in novel antiviral drugs. To study the mechanism of action of ribavirin-based antivirals, Cameron developed an analytical assay that could monitor whether ribavirin could incorporate into viral RNA. These experiments revealed that ribavirin-TP, which is made of similar building blocks to RNA, is incorporated into the viral RNA. He went on to demonstrate that ribavirin works by creating extreme mutation within viruses that forces them into genetic melt down. Working with Raul Andino and Shane Crotty, Cameron demonstrated that lethal mutagenesis could be used for safe poliovirus vaccine. He has also investigated the antiviral properties of viperin, a naturally occurring enzyme that is produced in humans and mammals. Cameron developed a microfluidic device that allowed him to simultaneously monitor thousands of cells infected with viruses. His research group infected cells in the device with a modified form of the poliovirus that produced a green fluorescent protein. The modified virus fluoresces when it is replicating, allowing researchers to monitor the replication of viruses in thousands of cells at a time. By applying potential antiviral compounds to the poliovirus infected cells, Cameron could screen for drug candidates. One of the antiviral drugs investigated by Cameron (T-1106) causes virus replication to pause and reverse, preventing efficient replication. In 2010 Cameron was part of a team at Penn State who were awarded a $2.85 million National Science Foundation grant for K‚Äì12 students. The project, Carbon Educators and Researchers Together for Humanity (CarbonEARTH), was led by Renee Diehl and looked to partner Penn State researchers with elementary and middle school children. Cameron joined the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill as Chair of the Department of Microbiology and Immunology in 2019.

The route will operate from Southdale Center Transit Center in Edina, Minnesota to either Stadium Village station in Minneapolis or further to Westgate station in neighboring St. Paul. Running mostly on France Avenue, Hennepin Avenue, and University Avenue, the line will serve major destinations such as Southdale Center, Fairview Hospital, 50th & France, Uptown, Minneapolis Sculpture Garden, downtown Minneapolis, Dinkytown, and the University of Minnesota. The route will have \\"train-like\\" features to speed up service and improve reliability, such as signal priority, bus lanes, all-door boarding, further stop spacing, and specialized vehicles. Planning and design is currently underway, with construction slated for 2023 and operations beginning a year later.  Route  The route was identified in Metro Transit's 2014 Arterial Transitway Corridors Study as one of twelve local routes to be upgraded to bus rapid transit. The study concluded that the busiest portion of Route 6, on Hennepin Avenue between downtown Minneapolis and Uptown, should be upgraded with an extension connecting it to West Lake station on the upcoming Southwest LRT. Since the release of the study, community members have expressed interest in having the upgrade cover more of the Route 6 corridor. In 2018 Metro Transit collected community feedback on 7 options south of Uptown and 3 options north of downtown Minneapolis. = Southern alignment = Metro Transit proposed seven alternatives for a southern alignment south of Uptown. *Alternative 1 ended at 50th and France Ave via 44th Street. *Alternative 2 ended at 50th and France Avenue via 50th Street and Xerxes Avenue. *Alternative 3 ended at 50th and Xerxes Avenue. *Alternative 4 ended at Southdale via Xerxes Avenue, 50th Street, and France Avenue. *Alternative 5 ended at Southdale via France Avenue. *Alternative 6 ended at Southdale via Xerxes Ave. *Alternative 7 ended at West Lake station, same as the concept plan from the 2014 report. Following feedback from the community, Metro Transit decided Alternative 4, 5, and 6 would advance for additional consideration and study. Ultimately Alternative 5 was selected as the preferred alignment and was presented to the Metropolitan Council September 23, 2019 to be adopted as the recommended alignment. Reasons for choosing France Avenue over Xerxes was the ability to serve commercial nodes at 44th & France and 50th & France, and direct access to the Fairview Hospital campus. = Central alignment = From the start of the project it was known that the E Line would travel along Hennepin Avenue from Washington Avenue downtown to Uptown Transit Station. At the time of the Arterial Transitway Corridors Study, Route 6 buses were only in motion 39% of the time between Uptown Transit Station and 7th Street downtown. From Uptown Transit Center to Franklin Avenue during morning rush hours, buses carried 49% of people traveling in the corridor while only making up 3% of vehicles. During the evening rush hours, buses carried 45% of people traveling in the corridor and only 2% of vehicles. To help speed up service and improve reliability, the City of Minneapolis and Metro Transit partnered for a bus lane pilot on Hennepin Avenue between Franklin and Uptown in May 2018. The pilot removed on- street parking south of 26th Avenue for southbound buses and on-street parking north of 26th Avenue for northbound buses. There was a three-day test from May 15 to May 17 to gather public feedback and better understand bus lanes. After the pilot concluded, the bus lanes were removed and on-street parking was restored. The pilot received positive feedback, but neither the City of Minneapolis or Metro Transit had near-term plans to permanently implement bus lanes in the corridor. On September 7, 2019, painted bus lanes were permanently installed on Hennepin between Franklin Avenue and Lake Street, the first painted bus lanes in Minnesota. The same day painted bus lanes were also installed on Chicago Avenue, which operates the busiest bus route on the system, Route 5, and is planned for the METRO D Line. The improvement resulted in more consistent travel times and a reduction of travel times by 12 percent. In downtown Minneapolis enhanced stations are being constructed with the Hennepin Avenue reconstruction project. The approved project layout, currently under construction, includes four rapid bus stations at Hennepin & 3rd/4th Streets, 5th Street, 7th/8th Streets, and 10th/11th Streets. = Northern alignment = Metro Transit proposed three alternatives north of Washington Avenue in downtown Minneapolis. The first option had the route end near Washington Avenue in downtown. The second option took the route over the Mississippi River into Nicollet Island/East Bank before taking the University Avenue/4th Street pair into Southeast Minneapolis. The route would pass through the Marcy-Holmes neighborhood and Dinkytown, serving a large student population. The route would run along the northern edge of the University of Minnesota campus before terminating at Stadium Village station. The third option was identical to the second, but with an extension along University Avenue to Westgate station in St. Paul. The option into Southeast Minneapolis was selected as the preferred alignment, with the final terminus to be decided during the engineering phase in 2020.

In the Supreme Court case, Mapp v. Ohio, the decision was made in favor of Mapp, in a 6-3 ruling. As a result of the ruling in Mapp v. Ohio, Mapp's conviction was voided. A few years after Mapp v. Ohio was ruled upon, Mapp was convicted again, but this time for the possession of narcotics. After her prison sentence had ended, she began working \\"for a non-profit that provided legal assistance to inmates.\\"  Mapp v. Ohio  In May 1957, following a bombing at the home of future boxing promoter Don King, police received a tip leading them to the home of Dollree Mapp. The police \\"showed up at Mapp's place, demanding to be let in.\\" Mapp refused and was advised by her lawyer to request a search warrant. The police left and returned in around 15 minutes, forcing their way into her house by breaking the door. The police would not show Mapp the search warrant, causing Mapp to believe the warrant was blank. She took the warrant and put it in her blouse so the police would not take it. However, one of the officers ‚Äúwent down anyway,‚Äù and took the paper from Mapp. The officer found evidence of pornography in Mapp's house. As a result, Mapp was \\"charged under an Ohio law that made possession of obscene material a felony.\\" Mapp was sentenced with 7 years in prison. While on bond, however, she appealed to the Ohio Supreme Court, which rejected her case. She then appealed to the U.S Supreme Court \\"on the basis of freedom of expression\\" and they accepted her case. The Supreme Court Justices all \\"drew laughs from the courtroom gallery while leaving no doubt how absurd they found Ohio‚Äôs obscenity statute.\\" Initially, there was unanimous agreement that the Ohio obscenity law was not in line with the First Amendment. However, when the argument was altered to focus on the Fourth Amendment by Justice Clark, only 5 justices decided that the evidence taken from Mapp's home, without a search warrant, was \\"illegally obtained.\\" In addition, the materials the officers had found, Mapp pleaded, were her roommate's obscene materials and commented saying, \\"Look at what terrible things men read. Let‚Äôs put it away.\\" This case's overarching question was, \\"Were the confiscated materials protected from seizure by the Fourth Amendment?\\" As a result of the Mapp opinion, the Supreme Court extended the obtainment of illegal evidence rule to the states. The case was argued on March 29, 1961 and decided on June 19, 1961.  Exclusionary rule  In Mapp v. Ohio the Supreme Court deemed it unconstitutional to use the evidence of pornography gathered from the police officers when they illegally searched Mapp's house. This ruling was based on the protection from \\"an unreasonable search or seizure\\" stated in the Fourth Amendment. However, the exclusionary rule is not cited in the Constitution, but rather a Supreme Court implication. The Supreme Court \\"found that the Fourteenth Amendment right to due process of law and the Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable searches and seizures could not be properly enforced as long as illegally obtained evidence continued to be presented in court.\\" This realization of the Court is what allowed Dollree Mapp and her lawyer to make a \\"motion to suppress\\" the evidence. In other words, having the judge determine whether the evidence was gathered legally. In Mapp's case it was not, so the evidence was not included in the trial. In the majority opinion, the Supreme Court \\"recognized that the purpose of the exclusionary rule \\"is to deter - to compel respect for the constitutional guaranty in the only effectively available way - by removing the incentive to disregard it.\\" However, the Court makes an effort to say that it is not the exclusionary rule which sets the appellant free, \\"it is the law that sets him free.\\" In Mapp v. Ohio, when Mapp's conviction was overturned it was due to the fact that the law \\"gives to the individual no more than that which the Constitution guarantees him.\\" Mapp v. Ohio, Gideon v. Wainwright, and Miranda v. Arizona, were all major cases that had large affects on policing and search warrant requirements thereafter.  Career  Dollree Mapp moved to New York after her Supreme Court case. In 1971, Mapp was arrested and sentenced to 8 years in prison for the possession of heroin. After serving prison time in the Bedford Hills Correctional Facility for Women, Mapp worked for a non-profit that \\"provided legal assistance to inmates.\\" She also worked as a talented seamstress and dressmaker, in addition to other businesses such as, beauty and upholstery. Her niece Carolyn Mapp stated that some of her aunt's businesses \\"were legitimate, and some of them were whatever they were.‚Äù Mapp also spoke at law schools and about her case Mapp v. Ohio. Later in 1987, she was interviewed by a political science professor and the book was later published.  Later years  Dollree Mapp was the sole survivor of her immediate relatives after her daughter Barbara died in 2002. It was around this time as well that Mapp began to show the beginning signs of dementia. She tried to stay active in her late 80s, but died on October 31, 2014, in Conyers, Georgia, when she was 91. Her great-niece Tiffany recalled, ‚ÄúMy great aunt was very, very, very strong-willed,‚Äù adding: ‚ÄúShe didn‚Äôt prepare for death. I think Aunt Dolly thought she was going to live forever.‚Äù  Personal life  Dollree Mapp was born on October 30 in Forest, Mississippi. She was one of 7 children and the daughter a cattleman and schoolteacher. When she was 10 years old, she left her family to live in Cleveland with her aunt. Five years later, Mapp was pregnant and gave birth to her daughter Barbara Bivins with the father, Jimmy Bivins, a boxer whom she soon after married. However, Mapp \\"accused Bivins of beating her, and they were soon divorced.\\" She said, ‚ÄúI had to leave him or kill him, and I wasn‚Äôt ready to kill him.‚Äù Later, Mapp was engaged to boxer Archie Moore, but he called off the wedding, in which case, Mapp \\"sued him for breach of promise.\\" The case involved allegations of sexual abuse and made headlines around the country; as a result, Mapp was a local celebrity in the African-American community in Cleveland, and her doings were reported in the society and gossip columns of Cleveland's popular African-American newspaper, the Cleveland Call & Post. Mapp had been in New York since her marriage to Bivins, but decided to move back to Cleveland (at 30 years old) with her daughter after the break up with Moore. She stayed close to the boxing world, and that is how she came into contact with her neighbor Don King, whose home had allegedly been bombed by the man the police were searching for the night they came to Mapp's house. After Mapp's case was appealed by the Supreme Court, she moved to Queens where she was arrested for possession of heroin and stolen property. \\"Mapp worked on issues related to prisoners‚Äô rights and sought to reduce long mandatory sentences for drug offenses,\\" which she continued later in her life after she was released from prison in 1981\\" when New York Gov. Hugh L. Carey ended her sentence. She kept working for inmates through her employment at a non-profit, which gave aid to inmates and gave her a platform to speak about her court experience.

In the moments preceding the fall, Chow was wandering alone inside the building and on a connecting footbridge. During the incident, in the nearby area outside the car park, there was an ongoing confrontation between protesters and the Hong Kong Police Force. Chow, a 22-year-old student of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, suffered a severe brain injury that would lead to his death due to a cardiac arrest four days later. Chow is believed to be the first to die from injuries sustained during the Hong Kong protests that started in 2019, but the exact circumstances that led to his fall is not known. The Coroner's Court will hold an inquest into the death from 16 November until 18 December 2020.  Personal background  Chow Tsz-lok, also known as Alex Chow, was a 22-year-old second-year computer science undergraduate student at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) at the time of the incident. His friends said that they do not know Chow's political views, as they hardly discussed politics at school. Aggregated in Incident The ledge from which Chow Tsz-lok fell =Prelude= After doxxing efforts by protesters to target police, private details of a police officer's wedding in Tseung Kwan O on 3 November 2019 were leaked and calls were made to crash the event, which would eventually lead to an overnight confrontation between police and protesters. Aggregated in Around 16:00 on that day, the police were dispersing protesters who were disrupting the wedding held at the Crowne Plaza Hotel in Kowloon East. About two hours later, the riot police arrived near the hotel. Aggregated in It is not known if Chow was among these protesters. The police said that security footage showed that Chow had departed from his home in Tseung Kwan O at 23:54. Hereafter, around 00:20 on 4 November, a large gathering comprising over 100 protesters, with some creating roadblocks, had formed at the junction of Tong Ming Street and Tong Chun Street. =Circumstances= Early 4 November, Chow sustained severe head injuries due to a fall from the third to the second storey inside the Sheung Tak car park in Tseung Kwan O. It was near an area of confrontation between protesters and police. It is unclear what the circumstances were that led to Chow's fall, why Chow was at the car park, and whether Chow was involved in the confrontations. CNN reported that there was no indication that Chow was involved in the nearby protest. Map displaying the whereabouts of Chow Tsz-lok before the incident The CCTV footage showed that Chow was wandering alone inside the car park and on a connecting footbridge from 0:26 to 01:02, which is when he was walking upwards to the third floor, the last moment captured on camera before the fall. Aggregated in In the time frame reconstructed from the footage, Chow was located in the Beverly Garden shopping centre at 00:19 and 00:23, on the connecting footbridge at 00:26 as he entered the car park, in the car park at 00:38, 00:44, 00:45, 00:47 and 00:49, on the same footbridge again from 01:00 to 01:01 as he walked towards Beverly Garden and then returned to the car park, and in the car park again at 01:02. The fall itself was not captured in the footage due to the operational camera rotations and parked vehicles blocking the view. The police said that they deployed tear gas in the area near the car park from 00:41 to 00:57. As reported in the Time, it was initially unclear whether or not the tear gas, fired near the car park where protesters and officers clashed, had played a role in Chow's fall. The Seattle Post-Intelligencer said that television footage showed police firing tear gas at the building \\"minutes earlier\\" from when Chow fell. The location where the police fired tear gas was reported as the junction of Tong Ming Street and Tong Chun Street along the area adjacent to the western side of the car park, which is on the opposite side of the building and about 120 metres (parallel to the building) to 160 metres (from the junction) away from the spot where Chow fell. In The New York Times, citing the security footage released by the building owner Link REIT, it was reported that there was no police presence or significant amounts of tear gas inside the car park in the moments before Chow fell. The police stated that officers conducted a dispersal operation in the building late Sunday, which happened before Chow arrived there, and a second operation that happened after Chow was found unconscious. They were there from 23:06 until 23:20 for the first operation. For the second operation, the police entered the building again at 01:05 from the ground floor to disperse protesters who had been throwing objects towards officers on the street from above. The CCTV footage showed that the police entered the building at the time. They also said that there were no police officers inside the building when Chow was walking around there. The police concluded their dispersal operation in the car park at 01:25 and in the nearby area around the Sheung Tak car park at 01:45. In a police briefing on 5 November, the Kowloon East Superintendent Wu Ka-yan said that Chow may have thought that there was a ledge below the third-floor wall, which led to his fall of four metres towards the second floor when he climbed over the wall. There were several people, including those in black clothing and firefighters, inside the car park at the time. The firefighters arrived at the car park at 00:55 in response to a call about a fire. At 01:05, they were informed by a passerby about Chow's fall onto the second floor. The firefighters requested an ambulance at 01:11 as they were providing aid to Chow. At 01:15, as seen in CCTV footage, over 20 police officers arrived at the spot where Chow had fallen and left about a minute later. Suzette Foo, the Senior Superintendent (Operations) of Kowloon East, said that their officers learned about Chow's injuries when they reached the second floor as they gradually moved from the ground floor upwards. She said that the firefighters told the police that they could handle the incident and did not require their help. The police dispersed the people near the scene, in which they pointed crowd control weapons at the protesters, but left the first-aiders alone to provide care. =Emergency services= The Hong Kong Fire Services Department gave the following account: At 01:11, ambulance A344 from the Po Lam district received an emergency call from firefighters and was dispatched for Chow at the second floor of the Sheung Tak car park. They arrived via Po Shun Road at Tong Ming Street, but they could not proceed further as they were held up by a queue of vehicles including double-decker buses and private cars. They then drove through the intersection towards the Sheung Tak Estate. At 01:20, they arrived near the Kwong Ying House of the Kwong Ming Court, where the way was blocked by private cars and fire engines. The ambulance personnel disembarked and walked to the scene with their equipment, arriving at their destination at 01:30, while their vehicle remained on the nearby road. The ambulance left with Chow for the Queen Elizabeth Hospital at 01:41 and arrived at the hospital's Accident and Emergency Department at 01:59. A similar press release was posted on Leung Kwok-lai, the Fire Services Department Assistant Chief Ambulance Officer (Kowloon East), said that the ambulance assigned to Chow did not come in contact with the police that were on duty. He also stated that there were five ambulances deployed for various incidents in the area around that time: ambulance A344 assigned to Chow, two other ambulances handling other persons, and the remaining two ambulances which did not handle any patients. The Fire Services Department said that it took 19 minutes for paramedics to arrive at the scene and that this was due to traffic congestion near the car park; this was seven minutes more than the 12-minute service pledge for emergencies. The police said that roadblocks set up by protesters had prevented vehicles from passing. Protesters maintain that the police blocked the ambulance from reaching Chow, which the police called false and groundless. In an email to HKUST staff and students pledging to take up the matter with police and demand clarification, HKUST president Wei Shyy said: \\"We saw the footage of ambulances being blocked by police cars and the paramedics walking to the scene, causing a delay of 20 minutes in the rescue operation of our student.\\" Aggregated in However, it was ascertained that the disseminated footage actually depicted ambulance A346, which was assigned to a person with shortness of breath and back pain who would decline ambulance services; the personnel encountered an ongoing police dispersal operation against protesters, where tear gas was used, and waited in the ambulance for safety. Chow remained hospitalised in a critical condition with a severe brain injury at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital from early 4 November until his death due to a cardiac arrest at 08:09 on 8 November. Aggregated in The hospital referred the case to the Coroner's Court. Investigation = Police investigation = The police stated that they would carry out an in-depth investigation, recommend an inquest into the death, and submit a report to the coroner. After reviewing footage from over 30 cameras provided by the building owner Link REIT, investigators ruled that Chow could not have been pushed by police officers as the police entered the car park after the estimated time frame of his fall, could not have been hit by beanbags or rubber bullets shot by the police as the distance was too great to reach him, and could not have fallen due to tear gas as no person in the area was affected and no smoke filled the area. However, the cause for the fall could not be determined from the footage. The police said that they would seek security footage from nearby buildings. = Injuries = It was reported that Chow had a fractured right pelvis from likely a lateral compression, a torn internal iliac artery, a fractured skull base, bleeding in mainly the right half of the brain, and an intra-abdominal hemorrhage. He had no obvious injuries to his hands and feet, nor had he been shot with bullets or was he bruised from a beating. The toxicology results only showed drugs administered after his admission to the hospital. = Coroner's Court = As reported on 16 May 2020, Kwok Ka-chuen (Kenneth Kwok), Chief Superintendent of the Police Public Relations Branch, said that investigators had submitted a progress report to the Coroner's Court, which would open an inquest and make the documents public. Aggregated in The Corononer's Court held a pre-inquest review into the incident on 16 September 2020. Aggregated in The coroner's inquest will be held before Magistrate Ko Wai-hung from 16 November until 18 December 2020. Over 60 witnesses‚Äîincluding police officers, residents, paramedics, doctors, and forensic scientists‚Äîare expected to testify. A virtual reality reconstruction of the events, recreated from security footage, is expected to be shown. Responses in Hong Kong = Official responses = On 8 November 2019, the Hong Kong government expressed \\"great sorrow and regret\\" over Chow's death and extended sympathies to his family, and added that a \\"comprehensive investigation to find out what happened\\" was already under way. =Protesters= A memorial for Chow in Tamar Park on 9 November The death of Chow sparked heightened anger among protesters, repeated calls for revenge by protesters, and the escalation of protester violence. As part of the ongoing polarising disinformation, unsubstantiated claims about the police's role in the death of Chow began spreading widely among protesters and subsequently the public ‚Äì in particular, allegations that Chow had been chased and even pushed by the police, and that police blocked an ambulance from reaching him. During a 6 November forum at HKUST to discuss Chow's incident, a student from the Chinese mainland was assaulted, including repeatedly hit on the head, by a crowd of protesters. Aggregated in HKUST president Wei Shyy denounced those responsible for the violence and those who aided or abetted the attack. On 8 November, many people queued at the place where Chow had fallen to participate in a memorial, placing offerings of flowers, candles, and paper cranes. About a thousand protesters marched in the central business district; they chanted anti-police slogans and shouted at the police, including calling them \\"murderers\\". In several locations around Hong Kong, protesters blocked roads, lit fires, and vandalised Mass Transit Railway stations, while the police responded with tear gas. A graduation ceremony at HKUST on that day was cut short when masked students dressed in black took the stage and turned it into a memorial service for Chow. A vigil was held the next day in Tamar Park, with organisers claiming an attendance of 100,000, while police put that figure at 7,500. Aggregated in On 11 November, sparked by Chow's death, student protesters marched to the residence of HKUST president Shyy and called on him to \\"condemn police violence\\"; they daubed graffiti and vandalised the residence and also vandalised a Starbucks caf√© and Bank of China branch on campus; classes at HKUST were cancelled for repairs after mass vandalism on the campus. The death of Chow ignited an escalation of violent protests, initiating the so-called \\"Blossom Everywhere\\" campaign from 11 November onward in which protesters established roadblocks, disrupted train services, and vandalised public spaces across the city that would ultimately lead to conflicts where a protester was shot in Sai Wan Ho, a man was doused and set on fire in Ma On Shan, and an elderly man was killed after he was hit with a brick in Sheung Shui, eventually culminating into large-scale police sieges on university campuses, such as at the Chinese University of Hong Kong and at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, where the protesters had retreated to serve as their bases of operation. = Others = Man-Kei Tam, the director of Amnesty International Hong Kong, called for an independent and urgent investigation into the events leading to Chow's fall, including into the allegations that the police delayed the ambulance. The activist Joshua Wong said that Chow's death made the demand for an independent investigation into police conduct even more crucial, stating that \\"Reforming the Hong Kong police force has become a big demand in the society,\\" and asserted that \\"Obviously, the Hong Kong police force has to be accountable for Chow's death.\\" The Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor observed the absence of trust between police and the public and thus urged the coroner to \\"proactively investigate, and take additional measures to ensure the credibility of the investigation.\\" In an open letter, HKUST president Wei Shyy called for a thorough and independent investigation into Chow's death, and a clarification from all parties and especially the police to the cause of the ambulance delay. The provisional president of the HKUST student union, Lai Wai-chun, said that he hoped that the university authorities could investigate the reasons for Chow's death and the alleged delay in emergency medical personnel reaching Chow. The police responded to Shyy's open letter, stating the following points: the Regional Crime Unit of Kowloon East was investigating the case and would do so in depth; the police had recommended a death inquest and would submit a death investigation report to the coroner; the Fire Services Department clarified that the ambulance had no interaction with police officers at the scene, but was obstructed by buses and private cars and not by police vehicles.  Aftermath  An article published by Next Magazine alleged that Po Fook Memorial Hall, which supposedly had been approached by Chow's mother to organise her son's funeral arrangements, had declined to hold Chow's funeral ceremony and said that the entire funeral services sector would not help her. The Po Fook Memorial Hall denied the report and said that they were working with Chow's family to provide services. The public service was held on the evening of 12 December. Aggregated in On 25 February 2020, the Sai Kung District Council announced that they will hold a meeting on 3 March, as eight members of the Council requested that the two resting places in the Tseung Kwan O district be named \\"Chow Tsz-lok Memorial Park\\" and \\"Chan Yin-lam Memorial Park\\". This caused an uproar against the decision, with the public condemning such action as disrespectful to the deceased and their families, as well as nearby residents. The families of the deceased have not been consulted by the proposers of the motion.

Criminological studies spanned across his entire career, from an examination of the Black Market during World War II to much more general treatments of white collar crime. His 1957 textbook Sociology of Deviant Behavior (co-authored with Robert F. Meier starting in 1979 with the 5th edition) is now in its 15th edition. In addition to studies within the United States, Clinard did research in Sweden, India, Uganda and Switzerland: supported, respectively, by the Fulbright Program, the Ford Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation and the U. S. National Science Foundation.  Academic life  After graduating prep school in 1928 from Governor Dummer Academy in Newbury, Massachusetts, Clinard attended San Diego State University for two years, then transferred to Stanford University where in 1932 he earned a bachelor's degree in Anthropology. Finding few teaching opportunities in anthropology at the depth of the depression, he switched to Sociology and continued at Stanford as a graduate student. As an undergraduate he had become aware of Edwin Sutherland's 1924 book Criminology and, upon completion of his M. A. degree in 1935, he moved to the University of Chicago to work with Sutherland as a Ph. D. student. Clinard not only gained a theoretical understanding of the way people become engaged in criminal behavior (including Sutherland's theory of differential association) but also learned qualitative research techniques while working under Sutherland, Herbert Blumer and (after Sutherland moved to Indiana University in 1935) Ernest Burgess under whose guidance Clinard completed his Ph. D. dissertation. In 1937, with his coursework requirements met, he took his first teaching job at the University of Iowa and did research on property-crime offenders who were sentenced during the 26-month period from July 1938 through August 1940 to the Iowa Men's Reformatory. He surveyed 200 offenders to quantify sociological variables, as influenced by whether the offender grew up in a rural, village and urban setting. And, for 60 rural or village offenders he quantitatively and qualitatively examined the roles of geographic mobility, gangs or associates, and criminal self conception. = Black market crime = In July 1941, with the data for his dissertation in hand, he moved his family to Washington D.C., working first as a statistician in the Bureau of the Census, then, from December 1942 to September 1945, chief of the Analysis and Reports Branch of the Office of Price Administration (OPA). The OPA work provided information he used in a 1946 publication, and led in 1952 to publication of a book about the black market. Clinard argued that the black market is not an outgrowth of gangster or marginal businesses. The political scientist Marver Bernstein faulted the book for lack of detailed discussion of the relationship between the OPA and the War Food Administration but found to be significant Clinard's statistics suggesting that \\"violators were not chiefly recruited from persons of recent immigrant background.\\" In 2010, an entry in the Encyclopedia of Criminological Theory by professor of Criminal Justice Kip Schlegel praised Clinard's documentation of OPA action, using methods which are \\"a model for ... studying the nature and enforcement of white-collar crime.\\" In 1952, the year the Black Market Crime book was published, Clinard expanded on this study by discussing aspects of societal corruption in a variety of domains: political, individual, sports, etc. In a cover story of the Sunday New York Times magazine he demonstrated that these problems in the U.S. were occurring amid increasing levels of mobility, urbanization, individualism and materialism, and gave the problems a historical and sociological context. At the end of World War II he took a position for a short time at Vanderbilt University then went to the University of Wisconsin for the bulk of his career. = International: Sweden & India = A 1954-1955 sabbatical year in Sweden provided an opportunity to deepen his Ph. D. research about the relationship between the locale where Iowan property crime offenders were raised and characteristics of their criminal activity. He replicated the earlier study in Swedish areas with the same mix of rural, village and urban upbringings but in a population much more homogeneous with regard to race, religion and culture. Both this study and a 1954 replication study in Iowa itself confirmed many of the original findings, but found that, unlike Clinard's study during the early 1940s, by the mid-1950s in Iowa (and also in mid-1950s Sweden) rural offenders did not frequently leave the community in which they lived to commit crimes. Furthermore, the two follow-up studies found less tendency than the original research did for city-raised property offenders to move progressively toward more serious and complex property crimes over time. In 1958 Clinard started a more-extensive series of leaves-of absence from the University of Wisconsin: two years in 1958-1960 and another year in 1962-1963. Supported by the Ford Foundation, Clinard served as resident consultant to an Indian government program to promote self help as a means to change the slums of Delhi. He played a consultant role within a program launched in 1958 by the government of Delhi, India. The program became a department of the Delhi city government (alongside departments of health, sanitation, education, etc.) under the name \\"Department of Urban Community Development.\\" B. Chatterjee, a social worker who for the previous ten years was executive secretary of the Indian Conference of Social Work was named Project Director. As part of the first two years' activity, Chatterjee and Clinard wrote a detailed description of their organizational procedures. The idea was not to view slums from an economic point of view, but rather to foster establishment of community associations, encourage local residents toward leadership, inculcate pride, and tackle civic services on an extremely local level. Starting with two community organizers and six small neighborhoods and expanding to cover (still) only a small portion of the slums of Delhi, the first question asked at an initial group meeting was \\"What problems do you think the people in this area could solve for themselves?\\" Some interviewers sensed that this might be the first time that a resident had been asked what residents themselves could do to solve problems. In 1966 Clinard published a book which showed how the Indian effort fit within the international context and described, inter alia, how the smallest of neighborhoods in Delhi (vikas sabhas of ca. 25 families) fit into larger vikas mandals of typically around a thousand people or more people and, in some cases, even larger areas consisting of multiple vikas mandals. = Deviant Behavior, Anomie & Criminological typology = Clinard first published the textbook The Sociology of Deviant Behavior in 1957, followed by two or three further editions each decade since then. Starting with the 5th edition (1979) Robert F. Meier has co-authored this book, and in 2016 the 15th edition appeared. Earlier, elements of Clinard's contentions about deviant behavior, as well as the phrase \\"deviant behavior\\" itself, appeared in a work about criminal behavior. At the 1962 annual meeting of the American Sociological Association Clinard chaired a session titled Social Deviance and Disorganization where each of five sociologists presented a talk titled \\"_____ and Anomie: A Critique\\" and a sixth talk titled \\"Summary and Comments\\" was given by Robert K. Merton. The Free Press published a book edited from contents of the session. Milton L. Barron reviewed it, saying that the book reflects the importance of anomie theory to the analysis of social problems and that the theory of anomie vies with concepts such as \\"social forces, consciousness of kind, culture, primary and secondary groups, social disorganization, and differential association\\" and that the combination of Clinard's opening essay \\"The theoretical implications of anomie and deviant behavior\\" and Merton's concluding essay \\"Anomie, anomia, and social interaction\\" provide a framework within which these theories can vie. Barron specifically recommends to students of crime and delinquency the treatments of gang delinquency by Short, of drug addiction by Lindesmith and Gagnon and of inebriety and alcoholism by Charles R. Snyder. In 1967 Clinard and Richard Quinney, a Ph. D. student at University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison in the late 1950s, published a book which proposed, in place of a legalistic or an individualistic classification of criminal behavior, a division of eight criminal behavior types characterized by sociological properties and based on a theory of crime. The eight types of criminal behavior (violent personal, occasional property, occupational, political, public order, conventional, organized and professional) are each described by Clinard and Quinney and the discussion is deepened using readings, numbering 35 in total. In 1973 a second edition with each type described in greater detail by Clinard and Quinney but with no readings was published and in 1994 a third edition was published with the addition of a third author, John Wildeman. = International: Uganda & Switzerland = In 1968 Clinard obtained a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation to teach and do research at Makerere University in Kampala and to help develop a program in deviant behavior and criminology. The grant also supported a doctoral student, Daniel Abbott. Together with a research staff they undertook a study of crime in Uganda, with emphasis on Kampala, and reported their research in a book which concluded that development often entails increased corruption in business and government and also tends to include an increase in crimes like armed robbery and auto theft, primarily by young under-trained males who have migrated to the city looking for work, but with little prospect for finding jobs, especially in the absence of relatives or friends in the city to help them adjust. Abbott's prior development experience in Latin America and Clinard's work in both developed and underdeveloped countries helped place this study in a wider geographic context. The attention on rural to city migration and on the role of slums is natural given the attention to these issues in Clinard's prior experience. The book has received attention from within Africa and beyond. During 1973-1974 Clinard received support from the U. S. National Science Foundation to study crime in Switzerland. He confirmed that Switzerland's reputation for low crime is supported by the data and explored the sociological roots of this. Clinard showed that the level of conventional crime is lower in Switzerland than in other comparably affluent and industrialized urban societies. And, he bolstered this finding by using multiple independent comparisons with other countries, for example by showing that Swiss public concern with crime is low and only slowly increasing and by documenting a near-constancy of insurance rates for burglary and theft in Switzerland. Clinard mustered data (only available to a limited extent) on Swiss white-collar crime to argue that Switzerland is high in crime, when viewed from this perspective. = Corporate crime = Clinard and his students studied 1975 and 1976 federal data regarding administrative, civil, and criminal actions against the 582 largest publicly owned U. S. corporations. The results and methodology of the study are described in reports published by the ICPSR at the University of Michigan. The study, which was financed by a grant from the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration (LEAA) of the Department of Justice, found that although 40% of these corporations were not charged with any violation during the study's two- year duration the other 350 corporations were charged, on average 4.4 times each during 1975 and 1976. It was found that violations were more common in certain industries, especially the oil, pharmaceutical and motor vehicle industries, and that the more serious violations tended to fall in the domains of labor law and product quality. For the reissue of the Corporate Crime book in 2006, Clinard wrote a 35-page introduction which included analysis of the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill, the 2001 Enron and the 2002 WorldCom bankruptcies and the Tyco International scandal. In 1983 Clinard based a book on corporate ethics on interviews with former middle managers, retired from positions in large corporations. In 1990, Clinard published a book on corporate corruption with an emphasis on ethics, corporate abuse and impact on the democratic process.  Personal life  Clinard was born on November 12, 1911, the first child of Gladys Edna (n√©e Barron) Clinard and Andrew Marshall Clinard. His twin sisters Barbara and Bettie were born in 1920. Clinard said that the death of his father when he was 14 years old and his sisters were only five, and the loss of most of the family's money in the 1929 crash three years later, give him \\"a new role in the family\\" and \\"matured me beyond my years.\\" A life-long love of travel and a fascination with previously-unexperienced cultures developed as early as age 19 when he participated during the summer after his junior year at Stanford in the Chaco Canyon Field School under the guidance of Edgar Lee Hewett. He met Ruth Mary Blackburn, from Olney, Illinois, at the University of Chicago where they both were graduate students: he in sociology, she in social work. They married in 1937 and had three children, Marsha Ruth, Lawrence Marshall and Stephen Andrew, born in Iowa City, Washington and Madison respectively. Ruth shared his love of travel, both domestic and international, including the four faculty-improvement leaves plus travel to West Africa and multiple trips, into their eighties, to France, India and Nepal among other destinations, to enjoy their love of nature, trekking and observing mankind. She participated in the production of all his books both through technical and content editing and through travel planning. Upon his retirement in 1979 he and Ruth lived in Santa Fe until 1990 when Ruth's health occasioned a move to lower-elevation Santa Barbara. When Ruth died in 1999 Marshall moved back to Santa Fe and continued a life of writing and travel, marrying a former student, Arlen Westbrook. They bought a house in Santa Fe, traveled frequently until the end of his life, and with her help he continued writing, including a 35-page Introduction to a 2006 reissue of the Corporate Crime book and an article which included his understanding of how his career in criminology came about. He died at age 98 ¬Ω. Clinard's sense of humor, sometimes devastatingly mordent, was often related to his career. For example, he dedicated his second book, about deviant behavior, \\"To my children, from whom I have learned a great deal\\" ‚Äì a quote which gained notoriety when it was displayed in a Playboy magazine blurb. He loved to point out behavior stemming from self perception (\\"How old would you be if you didn't know your age?\\") and to be provocative, as in the toast he sometimes gave when among criminologists: \\"To more crime, for without it we would not be employed.\\"  A career in criminology  As he explained near the end of his life, his career as a sociologist and more specifically as a criminologist stemmed from both personal and academic factors. The personal factors include the maturity thrust on him by early family losses and his mother's admonition that he not become a businessman. The academic factors include concrete ones, for example his choice of Sociology over Anthropology because of greater employment opportunities, his seeing the preparations for hangings while leading student tours to Alcatraz and San Quentin as part of his criminology- course \\"reader\\" job at Stanford and similar tour-guide experiences in neighborhoods of Chicago during his Ph. D. studies. In his perception, abstract factors were crucial in his choice of a career in criminology. When, early in his time in Chicago, fellow students labeled him as a \\"criminologist\\" (maybe based on his tour-guide role) he understood this labeling and his reaction to it as an example of George Herbert Mead's theory which Blumer labeled as Symbolic interactionism. And one part of his contact with Edwin Sutherland at Chicago was work assigned to Clinard as part of what eventually became Sutherland's book on white-collar crime. Thus began Clinard's life-long espousal of Sutherland's theory of Differential association and emphasis on white-collar and corporate crime. From early in his career Clinard was active in both quantitative and qualitative sociology. His Ph. D. dissertation and his first post-Ph. D. employment with the Bureau of the Census in Washington D. C. exhibit a strong quantitative, statistical, bent and this contrasts with the role he played at the qualitative end of the spectrum among his colleagues at the University of Wisconsin, influenced by his contact with the qualitative approach to sociology which predominated at the University of Chicago.

As protesters disrupted traffic to facilitate a general strike on 11 November 2019, other protesters inside Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) threw objects onto railway tracks near the University station, to which the Hong Kong Police Force responded by shooting pepper bullets at students and launching volleys of tear gas into the campus. The next day saw various clashes and skirmishes between the two sides, with the police storming into campus to conduct arrests while the protesters, in response, threw petrol bombs. After nightfall, the university's vice-chancellor and president Rocky Tuan arrived to seek mediation with the police, who refused to negotiate. The conflict escalated into widespread protests in various parts of Hong Kong in an attempt to divert the police's attention. At least 70 students were injured. Protesters briefly occupied the university from 13 to 15 November and set up barricades and crafted makeshift weapons inside the university campus. Other university students also barricaded the school after the siege. The majority of the protesters left the campus by 15 November, with some leaving for the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, which was besieged by the police on 17 November. The police received criticism for storming the university campus, though they defended the act, claiming that the campus was a \\"weapon factory\\". Background As the number of allegations against the Hong Kong Police Force during the 2019‚Äì20 Hong Kong protests continued to increase, violence from both the protesters and the police escalated significantly. The death of Chow Tsz Lok, who died after falling from the second storey of a building onto a car park in Sheung Tak Estate, Tseung Kwan O, led to widespread outrage in Hong Kong. While the cause of his death is unknown, protesters accused the police of obstructing paramedics from attending to him, resulting in a delay in treatment. Protesters began calling for a general strike, which would be facilitated by the obstruction of traffic during rush hours. Demonstrators dubbed the strategy as \\"Operation Dawn\\". Protesters inside the Chinese University of Hong Kong were also involved in this operation. History =11 November= Students in CUHK began throwing objects onto the East Rail Line metro tracks, while the police set up a defensive perimeter at the No. 2 Bridge. At 8:00 am, the police confronted protesters at No. 2 Bridge, and at 11:00 pm, the police shot volleys of tear gas into the university campus. The protesters reacted by using incendiary bombs. Soon after, the university announced the suspension of lessons for the day. = 12 November = The police shot numerous volleys of tear gas into the campus of CUHK on 12 November. On the second day of the conflict, protesters continued to attempt to block traffic. Students again began to throw objects onto the metro tracks and blocked major roads nearby. Starting at 7:00 am, the police began a standoff with the protesters, who attempted to stop the police from clearing the roadblocks set on the bridge. Vice-presidents of CUHK attempted to negotiate with the police, who were willing to retreat. However, the negotiations broke off as the police advanced and began firing tear gas into the campus, while the student protesters, in response, hurled bricks and petrol bombs. The police entered the university through the No. 2 Bridge, arrested several people inside the campus, and shot canisters of tear gas and rubber bullets at the Sir Philip Haddon-Cave Sports Field. Some students also broke into the school's storage room and retrieved bows and arrows. In the evening, several alumni of the CUHK, including businessman Ricky Wong, returned to CUHK to stand in solidarity with the student protesters. CUHK vice-chancellor Rocky Tuan was at the scene and attempted to negotiate with police representatives; police responded by rejecting the request for negotiation and ordering Tuan to leave immediately, saying that he was not able to control the situation. Protestors also demanded the police release the students who had been arrested inside CUHK. At around 7:30 pm, while Tuan was still on campus, the police began firing tear gas at the protesters, who, in response, hurled a large number of petrol bombs, forcing the police to retreat from their initial position. At 10:00 pm, the police for a short time deployed water cannons, while protesters threw petrol bombs to stop them from advancing. The police issued a statement about 10 minutes later to announce that they would be retreating from campus to stop the situation from further escalating. Former university president Joseph Sung Jao-yiu arrived at the campus on 10:30 pm in an attempt to deescalate the situation. To divert the police's attention, protesters instigated conflicts elsewhere in Hong Kong. Protesters marched into the Festival Walk shopping centre in Kowloon Tong after the mall closed early and set a giant Christmas tree on fire; some glass balustrades and doors were also smashed. A China Mobile shop was set on fire in Causeway Bay. In Sheung Shui, a train was firebombed and objects were thrown onto the train track. In Mong Kok, police fired multiple tear gas rounds as protesters blocked roads and vandalised public infrastructure, such as traffic lights and switchboxes. In Tin Shui Wai, protesters besieged and started a fire inside the police station. In Sha Tin, a police van was lit on fire. A volunteer paramedic reported that at least 70 protesters were injured. The university gym room was turned into a field hospital to treat the wounded. Five students arrested inside the campus were charged with rioting. The police announced that 142 people were arrested on 12 November. Police also reported that they had used about 1,567 canisters of tear gas, 1,312 shots of rubber bullets, 380 shots of bean bag rounds, and 126 shots of sponge grenades to disperse the protesters. = 13‚Äì14 November = After the confrontations at CUHK and other universities on 12 November, protesters turned the university campuses into strongholds. Supplies were delivered to them by supporters of the protesters from various districts in Hong Kong. Expecting the riot police to return, some of the protesters stayed in CUHK and slept in the car park and the sports grounds. In the morning of 13 November, protesters fortified the campuses by constructing roadblocks and barricades using bricks and furniture such as tables and chairs at major entrances near the university. Supplies from supporters, including medical bandages and food, were delivered to various universities in Hong Kong. A gym room inside CUHK was converted into a first-aid station. Protesters also practised throwing petrol bombs inside the campus, set up caltrops, removed sports equipment such as bows and arrows, javelins, and rackets, and set up makeshift catapults. Media noted that protesters were recreating \\"medieval weapons\\". University administration cancelled all classes for the remaining semester. The president of the CUHK student union applied for an interim injunction to stop the police from entering the university campuses without proper warrant, though the court dismissed the application. The police sent one of their boats to CUHK to evacuate a group of mainland Chinese students from the university, after they had expressed concerns for their safety at the campus; the police said the students had been unable to leave the campus by road due to obstructions. The Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Hong Kong sent representatives to CUHK and arranged for 85 Taiwanese students to return to Taiwan. =15 November= At 3:00 am, three masked protesters at CUHK held a press conference. They indicated an intention to reopen one lane in each direction of the Tolo Highway as a symbol of good faith, demanding the government hold the 2019 District Council elections as scheduled on 24 November, release arrested people, and establish an independent commission of inquiry within 24 hours. In a statement, the CUHK Students' Union stated that they questioned the three protesters' plan to open the highway to traffic, and that none of their members participated in the press conference. Protesters cleared one lane in each direction at 6 am; however, the Transport Department kept the highway closed due to safety concerns. The highway was officially reopened at noon. Protesters blocked the highway again at 7:30 pm after Chief Secretary for Administration Matthew Cheung rejected their demands. Protesters began to leave CUHK Friday night, as divisions within the protesters showed up as to whether they should leave the campus. Some argued that the occupation of the university did not align with the fluidity the protesters had exhibited since the protests started in June. Aftermath The empty shell of the fired tear gas left by the Police. As protesters clashed with the police at the CUHK, they also barricaded other university campuses, including the Hong Kong Baptist University, the City University of Hong Kong, and the University of Hong Kong. In addition, many protesters who withdrew from CUHK moved to join the protesters stationing inside Hong Kong Polytechnic University. Protesters staying in the Polytechnic University began clashing with the police on 17 November. The campus was then besieged by the police, who blocked all the exits of the university campuses, kettling at least 500 protesters. While some surrendered, many, including the wounded, stayed inside the campus without medical care for several days. The siege was the longest confrontation ever to occur since the demonstrations began in June, and was viewed as a setback for protesters as the police arrested more than 1,000 people during the siege.  Responses Protesters confronting the attack by the paramilitary riot police. Academics from the Scholars‚Äô Alliance for Academic Freedom condemned the police operations inside the university campus, calling them \\"unlawful\\". According to some South Korean students, the siege of CUHK echoed the June Struggle, where protesters from Yonsei University clashed with the police in 1987. The pro-democracy camp issued a statement asking for international level assistance to save the students and to avoid the repetition of a 4 June Incident. The declaration criticised the actions of police on No. 2 Bridge, who intentionally provoked students and showed no willingness to negotiate. The statement also criticised the police for cutting off supplies to CUHK and trying to invade the university by constant shooting, which had injured many students. The camp also expressed distress towards Chief Executive Carrie Lam, and reminded the students to be careful and to protect themselves. On 11 November, President Rocky Tuan contacted the police and urged them to be calm. The university staff also encouraged the students to leave. Given the tense atmosphere, the university security office tried to mediate the situation. However, an unnamed CUHK staff member criticised the school for inadequate measures, and for having failed to ask the police to leave. The staff also showed empathy and understanding of students' behaviour. The presidents of Hong Kong's public universities released a joint statement expressing regrets that the campuses became occupied by protesters following \\"societal disagreements\\". The statement suggested that the protesters occupying the campus were not \\"originated from the universities, nor can they be resolved through university disciplinary processes\\" and urged the government to resolve the \\"political deadlock and to restore safety and public order now\\". A spokesperson from the police responded that the force did not need a warrant to enter the university under the Public Order Ordinance. The Hong Kong Police Force spokesman warned that the protesters' acts were \\"another step closer to terrorism\\", and called CUHK a \\"weapon factory\\". On 13 November, Taiwanese president Tsai Ing-wen posted on Facebook highlighting the previous invasions into university campuses by Taiwan police, which seriously harmed freedom of speech. She urged for international concerns about the situation in Hong Kong.

He is known for his work on Q fever, and led the team that developed the first vaccine against the bacteria that causes it. Early life Barrie Marmion was born in 1920 in Alverstoke, Hampshire, to Joseph, a pharmacist, and Melita \\"Millie\\" Marmion. He began studying medicine at University College London in 1939 and, after a brief secondment to the Welsh National School of Medicine because of the war, graduated in 1944. Career Marmion began his medical career at the Public Health Laboratory Service (PHLS) as a trainee in pathology; he was seconded in this position to Cambridge and Colindale, working in the virus reference laboratory at the latter. In 1951, he was awarded a Rockefeller Fellowship allowing him to travel to Melbourne, Australia, and work at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, where he studied Murray Valley encephalitis virus and respiratory viruses alongside Macfarlane Burnet. Marmion returned to the UK in 1952, joining Michael Stoker's Q fever research group at Cambridge University. He moved to Leeds as the head of the new PHLS virus laboratory in 1955. At Leeds, he published the first description of Q fever endocarditis and co-authored a paper with Leonard Hayflick identifying the cause of Mycoplasma pneumonia. Marmion returned to Melbourne in 1963 as the Foundation Professor of Microbiology at the newly established Monash University Medical School. At Monash, he established the microbiology curriculum for medical students while researching Mycoplasma antigens and hepatitis A. He left Australia for the UK again in 1968 after accepting a role as the Robert Irvine Chair of Bacteriology at the University of Edinburgh. Shortly after he arrived in Edinburgh, he was involved in investigating an outbreak of hepatitis B in the local dialysis unit; he discovered that the high mortality was due to concurrent hepatitis C infection. This investigation laid the groundwork for the principles of bloodborne virus control that would later be applied to HIV. In 1979, Marmion moved to Australia once again, this time as the senior director of medical virology at the Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science in Adelaide. He expanded the institute's diagnostic laboratory service and led a research group that was, at the time, a leader in virology research in Australia. Marmion's main research interest at this stage was Q fever; he spearheaded the development of Q-Vax, the first vaccine against Coxiella burnetii, the bacteria that causes Q fever. He observed that Q fever led to a post-viral illness and hypothesised that it could cause chronic fatigue syndrome. Honours Marmion was made an Officer of the Order of Australia in 1994 and received the Gold Medal of the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia. He chaired Australia's National Health and Medical Research Council for many years and served as president of the Australian Society for Microbiology from 1984 to 1986. He was a life member of the American Society for Rickettsiology and had a subspecies of Rickettsia honei, Rickettsia honei var. marmionii, named after him.

She was from a very modest background: her father was a docker and her mother was a dressmaker. She attended primary and secondary school in Algiers. Her university studies in literature and the political sciences were interrupted by the outbreak of the Algerian war of independence. As part of the revolutionary generation of 1954, she participated in the resistance movement for the liberation of Algeria. Arrested in early 1957 and later sentence, she had to leave the country until after the country gained independence in July 1962. Chafika was already very active in her early childhood as she participated in many activities such as scouts, municipal conservatory and went to summer camps that shaped her personality and open- mindness.

Because Town Councils are political, their size and structure can be changed due to electoral changes. Town Councils can be considered a very limited form of local government that are strictly limited to estate management, and where their members have no separation of powers from the national government. As of November 2019, there are 16 town councils operating in Singapore.  History of local government in Singapore  = Municipal Commission (1887 - 1951) = Singapore's rapid development in the 19th century meant that there was an increasing demand for the management of municipal matters beyond the ad-hoc management of such matters by the British colonial government. In 1887, the Municipal Commission of Singapore was established that split the administration of the town area and the rural districts, and also had its own source of municipal funds that were separate from government revenue. The Commission initially comprised an appointed full-time salaried president, and five elected members. It supported numerous improvement projects over the next few decades such as establishing a fire brigade, enlarging reservoirs, and providing street lighting. In 1913, the Commission was reorganised and elections were abolished, although they were reintroduced in 1949 to encourage greater civic participation. Three elections were held for the Commission from 1949 to 1950 before it was renamed in 1951. = City Council (1951 - 1963) = In 1951, the Municipal Commission was renamed the City Council when Singapore officially attained city status in the British Commonwealth. The Municipal Building, from which the Commission operated, was also renamed City Hall. The Municipal Building, where the Municipal Commission operated, was renamed City Hall in 1951.From 1951 to 1958, four full elections and one by-election were held for the City Council.  Absorption of City Council into Government  By 1959, there was a widespread perception that the City Council was inefficient and corrupt. For example, it was reported in The Straits Times that an advertising agent had to bribe his way to get his licenses on time. The People's Action Party (PAP) campaigned on the promise that if they were to win the general election on 30 May that they would reorganise the \\"present unwieldy, inefficient, expensive and wasteful system of government\\". First on the list of priorities was the absorption of the parallel administrations of the City Council and Rural Board into the central Government. When the PAP won, the Minister for National Development Ong Eng Guan signed an order taking over the functions of the City Council and centralising these municipal functions under the Government. The water, electricity and gas functions stayed with the City Council until 1963, when it was absorbed into the Public Utilities Board. = Pilot Town Council programmes (1986 - 1988) = Although the PAP campaigned in the early years that local government functions were inefficient for a small city-state like Singapore, the party changed its mind a few decades later. It decided in 1986 to decentralise some municipal functions because it wanted ostensibly to increase resident participation in estate management. As a result, three Town Councils were set up in Ang Mo Kio as a pilot programme to manage the estate. = Town Councils Bill and Act (1988) = The three pilot Town Councils were deemed to be highly successful and led to the introduction of the Town Councils Bill in Parliament in May 1988. Goh Chok Tong, who would eventually become Prime Minister in 1990, argued in Parliament that Town Councils not only provided for greater resident participation, but also would act as \\"political stabilisers\\". He cited the fact that in other democracies, e.g. Britain, there were inherent factors that resulted in greater political stability, such as long-term allegiances of constituencies to a certain political party. But in Singapore, > ... it is the PAP which provides the political stability. There is no other > party at present which can effectively govern Singapore. But this political > stability can be threatened by sudden temporary swings in national mood. If > there are such swings, the PAP can be out of power. If that happens, > political instability will result because no alternative leadership has > emerged which can effectively govern Singapore. Goh also noted in the same speech in Parliament that voters were confident that after decades of uninterrupted PAP rule, that even if they elected Opposition candidates to Parliament that they would still have a competent PAP Government managing their constituencies, which would result in a \\"free-rider\\" problem: > For example, some voters who want a PAP Government also want to see some > Opposition MPs. They may vote for an Opposition candidate and depend on the > PAP to look after their constituency because they expect other > constituencies to return PAP candidates in sufficient numbers to form the > government. Chiam See Tong, the MP for Potong Pasir and one of only two non-PAP MPs at that time, spoke at length rejecting the bill. Chiam argued that the role of an MP was to give direction to a nation, and not to manage municipal matters: > A party is elected because of its policy. The people may want the party to > represent them so that the nation can move in a particular direction. The > PAP first came into power on a socialist platform. People of Singapore voted > them in because they thought that was good for Singapore and so they went on > a socialist principle, up to lately, of course. Some people may want to vote > people like Margaret Thatcher, free enterprise, the capitalist line. You > vote her in. So that is the purpose of voting Members of Parliament and a > particular party. But you do not vote a Town Councillor to change the > direction or have a national policy in regard whether to foreign policy or > to national policies on education or defence, or how you should have a > relationship with your neighbours. These are not the work of town > councillors. These are the work of Members of Parliament. So there is a > distinct different role. He also noted that most MPs did not stay in the same constituency, let alone the same housing estate, of their residents, and would therefore not add much value to the residents in such matters. He proposed that Town Councils should be made non-political, but was rebutted by Lee Hsien Loong that MPs should care for their constituents as much as they cared about lawmaking: > If any MP stands in the next election and says, \\"Please elect me. I will pay > no attention to municipal matters. You go and find some non-political Town > Councillor on your own to manage that and you have it out with HDB should > anything happen\\", I do not think he is going to be elected. I do not think > the Member for Potong Pasir will put that in the SDP manifesto. Will he? > Perhaps not. Ultimately, PAP's supermajority in Parliament allowed it to pass the bill into law without further consultation.  Formation  Within 30 days of winning an election, an MP will have to form a Town Council of at least six members, but not more than 30. The Town Council will be headed by a Chairman who must be an elected MP, who can then appoint non-elected MPs to the Town Council as well. At least two-thirds of the appointed members must be residents of the Town to ensure good representation.  Functions  Town Councils are an extremely limited form of local government which generally covers the maintenance and repair of common property in HDB estates (not private property). These include but are not necessarily limited to cleaning of common areas in HDB estates, lift maintenance, and some landscaping works, such as grass cutting. Unlike local government, however, Town Councils are not directly elected and are in fact led by a Member (or Members) of Parliament who are elected through general elections. This means that the Town Council role is really an extension of the Member of Parliament responsibility, and not a separate office. Apart from common property in HDB estates, Town Council may also be required to manage or maintain other property as requested by the HDB or the Government on an ad-hoc basis. With the approval of the Minister for National Development, the Town Council can also opt to carry out the work of any public authority or association if there is mutual agreement to do so.  Powers  The Town Councils Act provides a Town Council with powers that enable it to maintain existing common property facilities, and also to establish new facilities, subject to the approval of the HDB where required. It can also maintain other property that is not common property if it is given permission from the Minister for National Development. It also has the power to set service and conservancy charges for the upkeep of the town. = By-laws = Under the Town Councils Act, a Town Council may make by-laws as part of its estate management role. As of 28 November 2019, there are 51 pieces of by-law legislation published in the Singapore Statutes. The by-laws generally cover three main areas: (1) the rules governing the use of common spaces and open areas in the estate; (2) conservancy and service charges to be paid to the Town Council; and (3) the penalties for not paying those charges.  Funding  The funding sources of Town Councils are largely dominated by Government, even though service & conservancy charges are collected from residents and commercial operators of the Town. = Funding Sources = Apart from service and conservancy charges (S&CC;) that are paid by the residents and commercial operators of the Town, a Town Council is also able to tap on numerous grants that the Government provides.  S&CC; Operating Grant  The S&CC; operating grant is given by the Ministry of National Development to support the Town Council with their operating needs. The grant is disbursed annually, and is allocated based on the number and type of HDB flats in the Town. Smaller HDB flats are given a bigger grant than larger ones. No grant is given for 5-room flats.  Goods & Services Tax (GST) Subvention  The GST Subvention is disbursed to the Town Council every quarter and has been used to offset the increase in GST on the S&CC; costs for residents at least since December 2002, when Lee Hsien Loong (then the Finance Minister) announced an increase in GST from 3% to 4%.  Lift Enhancement Programme  The Lift Enhancement Programme is a S$450m programme that was announced in September 2016, in view that the funds maintained by all the Town Councils (estimated at around S$1b in 2016) would not be sufficient for lift upgrading works in the housing estates, which was estimated at S$3b over the next 20 years. As a result of this programme, a new fund - the Lift Replacement Fund - was required to be set up by all Town Councils to contribute at least 14% of their income into. Under this programme, the HDB would co-fund up to 90% of the Town Councils' costs to retrofit older lifts with safety features and enhancements.  Lift Maintenance Grant  Announced in 2017, the Lift Maintenance Grant is disbursed annually and provides a S$600 grant per lift in every Town to the Town Council to alleviate the higher costs of lift-related servicing and maintenance.  Lift Replacement Fund Matching Grant  Also announced in 2017, the Lift Replacement Fund Matching Grant matches 50% of a Town Council's contribution to the Lift Replacement Fund and is disbursed quarterly.  Community Improvement Projects Committee (CIPC) Funding Town Councils can also apply to the Community Improvement Projects Committee (CIPC) through the Citizens' Consultative Committees of their Towns for funding support for \\"improvement projects in HDB estates for the benefit of local residents\\". This funding source is not explicitly stated on the MND website, but was revealed after a query by Pritam Singh, the MP for Aljunied GRC, in 2015. As of November 2019, the CIPC is made up of PAP MPs and losing PAP candidates from the most recent General Election. = Funds = Town Councils are required to allocate their monies into three distinct funds: * Operating Fund: For short- term, routine expenses; * Sinking Fund: For long-term, non-lift cyclical expenses; and * Lift Replacement Fund: For long-term, lift-related cyclical works.  Accountability  Town Councils have to comply with legislation in the Town Councils Act. Some things that are considered offences include poor corporate governance procedures (e.g. not keeping a register of conflict of interests), not complying with notices from the HDB or any official direction given by the Minister for National Development, misuse of monies from funds that are managed by the Town Council, and failure to submit audited reports or statements. In addition, the Town Councils Act also allows for the delegation of powers by the Town Council to \\"any employee thereof or any agent\\" to exercise or perform any function, power or duty.  Controversies  = Action Information Management Pte Ltd (AIM) = In December 2012, Aljunied- Hougang Town Council was scored the lowest banding for S&CC; arrears management. Sylvia Lim, the chairman of the Town Council, blamed the poor results on Action Information Management Pte Ltd (AIM), a vendor that provided computer systems for Town Council management. She claimed that the Town Council was \\"acutely aware\\" of the possibility that AIM, as a long-standing IT vendor for PAP Town Councils, could choose to withdraw from their contractual obligations at short notice. Because of this, the Town Council had to put in effort to create a new IT system, which compromised their level of service. Chandra Das, the AIM chairman, produced correspondence between the company and the Town Council that suggested otherwise - AIM in fact readily agreed to two extensions to the contract that was supposed to end on 1 August 2011. This point is later corroborated again in the judgment of Aljunied-Hougang Town Council and another v Lim Swee Lian Sylvia and others and another suit.  The structure of AIM and AIM's purchase of Town Council Management System  The People's Action Party logo. The complaint by Sylvia Lim on AIM led to an exchange between her and Teo Ho Pin. During one of those exchanges it was revealed that AIM was in fact backed by the PAP. It was owned by three former PAP MPs - Chandra Das, Chew Heng Ching and Lau Ping Sum. AIM was also discovered to be a company with just S$2 (the minimum) in paid-up capital, and put into question how such a company would be considered strong enough to sell a sophisticated piece of software to. Yet, AIM managed to bid successfully for the Town Council Management System (TCMS) owned by 14 Town Councils, for S$140,000, in 2010. This was done through an open tender where AIM was the only bidder. There was sufficient public interest in the matter for Lee Hsien Loong (the Prime Minister) to order an investigation into the transactions of AIM in January 2013. The scope of the investigation would also cover \\"observations on the nature of TCs and how they are run, with a view to improving the current framework\\". The Ministry of National Development published the report in May 2013, and it was also debated in Parliament. The Ministry's review team concluded in the report that not only did the PAP Town Councils comply with the open tender process under the Town Councils Act, there was no \\"pecuniary or direct interest\\" on the part of any of the Town Council members on AIM. = Aljunied-Hougang-Punggol East Town Council =  Aftermath of the AIM investigation  In May 2013, the MND report on AIM and Town Councils was debated in Parliament. Khaw Boon Wan, the Minister for National Development, expressed during the ministerial statement that there were concerns on how Aljunied-Hougang Town Council (AHTC) waived the requirement for open tender and awarded a multi-million dollar contract to FM Solutions and Services Pte Ltd (FMSS), a company that was formed just days after the General Election. Khaw mentioned several times during the ministerial statement that FMSS was formed and owned by a group of people loyal to the Workers' Party, and that awarding a contract without open tender seemed inappropriate.  Attorney-General v Aljunied-Hougang-Punggol East Town Council  About a year later, in February 2014, AHTC submitted its audited financial statements for the financial year ending 31 March 2013. Its auditor, Foo Kon Tan Grant Thornton LLP, prepared an auditor's report containing 13 grounds of qualification. The Auditor-General subsequently audited AHTC's financial statements and released a final report in February 2015, which the Ministry of National Development used as its basis to sue AHTC, mainly to force AHTC to appoint independent accountants to review their statements and ensure they complied with the Town Council rules. The case was dismissed in the High Court, mainly because judge Quentin Loh = Ang Mo Kio Town Council =  Criticisms  The Town Council model has been subject to criticism because it unnecessarily politicises what would have been a non- political function. Mak Yuen Teen, a professor at the National University of Singapore, suggested depoliticising the Town Council so that MPs can focus on \\"serving the residents in more impactful ways and on issues of national importance\\". He rejected the idea that Town Councils made MPs more accountable for the running of estates and said, > \\"What were MPs doing before there were town councils in 1989?\\" Didn't they > have political accountability then?

Plot The series follows the daily lives of a family of vampires that lives together in a European-style building known as 'Eternal Moon Mansion'. Kiyoi is the eldest who takes care of the others and acts as a father figure, Masakazu is a college student who gets information on criminal activities, while the youngest members, Ageha and Makoto, are high school students. Both of them tend to end up helping Masakazu, whether they really want to or not. They fight against crime when the cops are unwilling or unable to do so. Characters ; :Portrayed by: Y≈´ Miura :A sixteen-year-old high school student. Makoto is an introverted and reserved boy who rarely speaks and never says what he is really thinking. He is half-vampire and half-human; his mother abandoned him in a church when he was a child, condemning him as a 'demon' and regretting giving birth to him. In the church, he was abused by a priest, which left a big trauma on him. He was taken in by Kiyoi after a failed suicide attempt. Although he initially felt that he could not fit into the family, he later feels comfortable living with the others. ; :Portrayed by: Rakuto Tochihara :Originally a human, Ageha was the first who was adopted by Kiyoi after the death of his parents and grandmother when he was still very young. He is very close to Kiyoi, whom he loves deeply and views him as a father figure. Childish and carefree, he is very sensitive and has the ability to sympathize with other vampires. ; :Portrayed by: Naoya Ojima :A college student, the second to be adopted by Kiyoi. Masakazu is very naive and often acts stupidly, however, he is a dedicate reader and has an excellent memory, allowing him to memorize a lot of information. His room is full of books and is always messy. His parents were vampires and he arrived at Eternal Moon Mansion when he was around fifteen years old. He has proclaimed himself as the \\"Goukon Prince\\", although he never has any luck with girls. ; :Portrayed by: Hassei Takano :The owner of Eternal Moon Mansion and the legal guardian of Makoto, Ageha, and Masakazu. At first glance he appears to be in his thirties, but actually he is over 100 years old. Kiyoi is very polite and kind, although he can be very scary when he is angry. He is prone to melancholy and sadness since the death of D≈çzan, the man he was in love with. He feels angry because D≈çzan didn't agreed to become a vampire, choosing instead to die as a human, which also caused him to have a lot of repressed anger. Because he knows the pain of losing someone dear, he considers his current family very important and often overprotects the boys. ; :Portrayed by: Rei Fujita :A vampire, a university student who meets Masakazu during a goukon and since then rivals with him for the attention of the girls. He visits Eternal Moon Mansion occasionally, to the great annoyance of Masakazu. He is very handsome and charismatic, and the object of desire for many girls. ; :Portrayed by: Haruka Tomatsu :Makoto and Ageha's classmate. At first, she considered her life as boring and after discovering that Makoto was a vampire, she kidnaps him and wants him to bite her in order to become a vampire as well. After being stopped by Kiyoi, she acknowledges what she has done and apologizes to Makoto. She ends up obsessing with Kiyoi, visiting Eternal Moon Mansion very often and rivaling with Ageha for the later's attention. Her character is only relevant in the drama. In the manga, her name is never mentioned and after the incident, she is transferred to another school. ; :Portrayed by: Kentar≈ç Miyagi :Mainly known as 'Mister', is D≈çzan's grandson and the one who assigns cases to Kiyoi and the boys. He looks like his grandfather when he was young, although according to Kiyoi, his personality is quite the opposite. He often complains to Kiyoi that he cannot understand his hobby of playing 'to be a family' with the boys, but he still respects his decisions. He seems to have a one-sided love for Kiyoi. ; :Portrayed by: Kentar≈ç Miyagi :Is the late grandfather of Michitaka. Although his relationship with Kiyoi is never fully explained, both used to be good friends in the past and it's show that Kiyoi was in love with him.

The museum contains over 4,000 exhibits on decorative art in Uzbekistan, including wood carving, ceramics, embossing, jewelry, gold weaving, embroidery, and samples of mass production in local industry. History Until the beginning of the 21st century, the museum was located in the former palace of the Russian diplomat Alexander Alexandrovich Polovtsev Jr.. The museum building, known as the Polovtsev house, was purchased by his secretary Mikhail Stepanovich Andreev from Tashkent merchant Nikolai Ivanovich Ivanov. Under Andreev's guidance, the interiors of the house were readjusted and refurbished to fit an Oriental style. The main architect of this restructuring was A. A. Burmeyster. The house was known colloquially as the \\"Polovtsev House\\". The building is an example of Oriental architectural and decorative art, built in the late 19th century. The decoration, carving and painting of the building was done by Uzbek folk artists Usta T. Arsankulov, A. Kazymdzhanov (Tashkent), Usta Shirin Muradov (Bukhara), Usta A. Palvanov (Khiva), and Usta Abdullah (Rishtan).http://muzeyart.uz/ During the First World War, the house was used to hold captured Austrian officers. After the Russian Revolution until the mid-30s, the building housed an orphanage. Subsequently, various organizations operated out of the house, including a training center for ganch carving and embossing, as well as an embroidery workshop. Since July 1937, the house housed the Handicraft Museum, the Museum of Applied Art's predecessor.About the history of the \\"House of Polovtsev\\" in Tashkent In 1941 and 1961, the building was restored. In 1960, it received the name \\"Permanent Exhibition of Applied Arts of Uzbekistan\\". In 1970, the museum building was reconstructed.

History Painting from 1880: The Western Gasworks can be seen in the upper right corner and the ttunnel which took Gasv√¶rksvej under the railway embankment can also be seen to the left The land where the street runs today was formerly the site of a number of ropewalks. They ran all the way from Vesterbrogade and down to Kalvebod Beach. Denmarks first railway, between Copenhagen and Roskilde, ran on an embankment along the beach from 1847. Gasv√¶rksvej and the Western Gasworks seen on a map detail from the 1890s In 1853, it was decided to build Copenhagen's first gasworks on Kalvebod Beach. Gasv√¶rksvej, which was projected at the same time, was made extra wide to secure good access to the new installation. The gasworks started operations on 4 December 1857. It closed in 1927 and was replaced by the White Meet-Packing District. A line 16 tram on Gasv√¶rksvej Gasv√¶rksvej continued under the railway in a tunnel. In 1864, the rail line was moved to a more northern course, through Frederiksberg, before being moved to its current position just south of S√∏nder Boulevard in 1911. The railway was later replaced by a direct extension of Stormgade which was given the name Ny Stormgade. Copenhagen's haymarket relocated to the site in the 1880s and that section of Ny Stormgade was therefore renamed Halmtorvet (Haymarket) in 1896.

It opened on September 23, 2007 and was officially registered on April 14, 2008. The museum is connected to the Fine Arts University Center of S√£o Paulo (commonly known as \\"Fine Arts\\"), a private institution of higher learning, and is sustained through the School of Fine Arts Foundation of S√£o Paulo (FEBASP). The museum aims at the conservation, documentation, study, and exhibition of the collection of art and history saved since 1925 through the university center when it was founded under the denomination of the Academy of Fine Arts of S√£o Paulo. As a university museum, it also acts in the promotion and dissemination of the scientific production and cultural production of Fine Arts and how didactic experimentation and center of cultural diffusion, organizing temporary exhibitions and various educational activities. History The origin of the collection preserved by the Fine Arts Museum of S√£o Paulo predates the establishment of the institution in 2007 by more than eight decades. The collection began to be formed after the founding of the Academy of Fine Arts in S√£o Paulo, the oldest college specializing in the artistic education of the state capital, established in 1925. Created by the Gaucho politician, writer and musician Pedro Augusto Gomes Cardim, also founder of the Dramatic and Musical Conservatory of S√£o Paulo and Paulista Academy of Letters, and established with the support of intellectuals such as M√°rio de Andrade and Menotti Del Picchia, the Academy was of great importance for the development of the S√£o Paulo artistic environment at the beginning of the twentieth century when the incipient local artistic learning system was still largely based on informality. Installed at first in a house on Rua Bento Freitas, in the neighborhood of Vila Buarque, the Academy of Fine Arts began to offer courses of painting and sculpture and engraving in 1925 and, three years later, the first autonomous superior course in architecture in the state of S√£o Paulo. Since 1927, it began to organize periodic expositions of student work. The works acquired or donated during these exhibitions, as well as works performed didactic actives or to obtain an academic degree, constituted the first formative aspect of the collection. It also comprised a collection of replicas of famous sculptures and plaster pieces, used as models for copy studies. In 1932, by virtue of the state decree, the institution, renamed the School of Fine Arts of S√£o Paulo, became responsible for managing the collection of the Pinacoteca de Estado. The two institutions were closely linked during most of the 1930s, a period in which they also shared the same building, on Rua Onze de Agosto, and the same director, Paulo Vergueiro Lopes de Le√£o. The School of Fine Arts also had a major influence on the organization of the first editions of Sal√£o Paulista de Belas Artes, in which several of its graduates took part. The administrative bond between the School of Fine Arts and the Pinacoteca do Estado was broken in 1939 when a reform of the S√£o Paulo executive power organization chart restored the museum's status as an autonomous organ. Nevertheless, both would continue to share the same space after being transferred to the old building of the Lyceum of Arts and Crafts of S√£o Paulo in the Jardim da Luz. The proximity of the state art collection to the Pinacoteca of the State would alleviate the deficiency resulting from the lack of an own art gallery that served as a reference to didactic activities. Still, the School of Fine Arts maintained its intention to create art galleries, with works of students and pensioners, copies, reproductions and anything else necessary for the development of teaching', as stated in its regulations. The exhibitions of student works would continue in the Lyceum building highlighting in this context some museological studies in the area of expography, punctually marked by pioneering practices, in line with the late transitions environment of academicism for cutting edge production. At the same time, the institution's collection grew through the sporadic acquisition of works and donations from students and teachers. In the 1980s, then called the Faculty of Fine Arts, the school began the process of transferring to its current facilities in Vila Mariana, completed in 1985. On the new campus, it expanded its area of activity by the opening of the design, social communication and international relations. Consequently, it also diversified the collection (then under the custody of the Luciano Octavio Ferreira Gomes Cardim Library or dispersed throughout its facilities), which now encompasses copies of graphic arts and representative works of contemporary industrial \\"design.\\" In 1999, the college opened the Professor Vincente Di Grado Gallery, an exhibition space dedicated to hosting contemporary art shows. In early 2007, a group of teachers presented to the board of Fine Arts which already held the status of university center, the proposal to create a historical and artistic museum based on the library's collections. The project, prepared by professors Leila Rabello de Oliveira, was taken over by the board. The museum was inaugurated on September 23, 2007, as part of the 82nd anniversary celebrations of Fine Arts, with the aim \\"\\"organizing, conserving, exhibiting and diffusing the memory of the institution, as well as to document the development of the arts, communication, architecture and \\"design\\", having as its main axis the scientific and artistic production of its teachers, students and directors\\".\\" As a university museum, the institution was also conceived as a didactic experimentation laboratory, integrated into the academic daily life, and a cultural diffusion space, promoting educational activities aimed at the general public. The museum was officially registered on April 14, 2008. Since its inauguration, the Fine Arts Museum of S√£o Paulo has organized exhibitions of historical themes, aiming to give greater visibility to the trajectory of the university center. It also seeks to position itself as a diffusing center for reflections on contemporary cultural and artistic production. In the field of museology a dexpography, we highlight the creation of Gallery 13, an experimental space dedicated to the exercise of activities related to criticism, curatorship, and mounting of exhibitions. The gallery also houses the \\"Exhibitions Editais\\", exhibitions of works of students selected by a committee. In November 2010, the museum was closed for a renovation of its facilities. It was reopened on June 8, 2011, with an exhibition of 40 pieces from its collection. Among the prominent exhibitions held in recent years by the museum, the highlights include \\"Art at the Academy: Historical Collection\\", in celebration of the 85th anniversary of the Fine Arts, with works by various artists linked to the school; \\"Brazil: Figuration x Abstraction - Late 1940s', dealing with the avant-garde experiments of the mid-twentieth century, in the transition from modernism to contemporary art, with works by, among others, Waldemar Cordeiro, Cicero Dias and Ant√¥nio Bandeira ; 'Comics\\"51\\", featuring rare publications, documents and original works by artists who attended the First International Exposition of Comics, held in S√£o Paulo in 1951; \\"Shut, Images of Transformations and Borders', with photographs of the British Peter Caton, documenting the economic transformations and social problems in the Cerrado; \\"Young Italian Video Art', selection of works by video art produced by students of the Center for Applies Arts and Multimedia Research of Rome, etc. Installations The Fine Arts Museum of S√£o Paulo occupies three distinct spaces on the Fine Arts campus in Vila Mariana. In the main unit, located at Rua Dr. Alvaro Alvim, is the \\"Collection Gallery\\", a large hall with 300 square meters of exhibition area, where works of the permanent collection are exhibited, in exhibitions of medium duration, in addition to the \\"Vicente Di Grado Gallery\\", dedicated to temporary exhibitions of art, architecture and social communication. The \\"Design Gallery\\" Core Gallery is located in the homonymous core of the University Center. The space is dedicated to hosting short and medium-term exhibitions related to the area of design and its segments, such as Graphic Arts, product s, fashion and Interior Design. In the Major Maragliano Street unit, the museum maintains the \\"Gallery 13\\", space directly linked to the visual arts course, dedicated to hosting exhibitions of artistic works performed by students or guest artists, as well as activities related to didactic exercises. in areas related to museology, such as editing, curating, critique, visual programming, and lighting. Activities In the field of museological activity, the institution maintains a permanent agenda of activities aimed at cultural diffusion, focusing on curating or collaboration in the organization and organization of exhibitions, of medium and short duration, with works of its permanent collection or provided by other private collectors and institutions, covering topics such as visual arts, graphic arts, architecture, design, media, history institutional and related themes, as well as the development of actions of art education parallel to the exhibitions. It also maintains museological documentation activities, such as cataloging, digitization, identification and study of pieces of the collection, with the participation and performance of students from the university center as monitors. In the field of scientific diffusion and production, the museum keeps students developing research related to its collection and the history of the institution, as well as related subjects, covering the arts, design, communication, and architecture. The main line of ongoing research at the museum is to produce an inventory of public works in the city of S√£o Paulo (monuments, murals, sculptures, etc.) produced by connected artists. to the School and Academy of Fine Arts, such as Rafael Galvez, Clovis Graciano, Amedeo Zani, Alfredo Oliani, Julio Guerra and Vicente Larocca. The research, which includes the survey and documentation of the in crazy documents, also aims to carry out an analysis of the state of conservation, the conditions of implementation and the surrounding, the symbolic value and the referential function of such works from the point of view. local communities, as well as the identification of aesthetic characteristics and stylistic classification of the production of such artists. The preliminary results of the research were presented during the VII Museum Week of the University of S√£o Paulo, in 2009. Collection The collection of the Museum of Fine Arts of S√£o Paulo is divided into two major nuclei: the artistic collection comprising works of art, objects of design and architectural projects, and the historical collection, composed mainly by document and photography. They are objects acquired through purchases and donations or produced in didactic activities, accumulated since the foundation of the Academy of Fine Arts in 1925 to the present day. The artistic collection brings together approximately 700 works, including paintings, sculptures, drawing and engravings, dating mostly from the 20th century, encompassing the period that goes from the academicism to the contemporary art, mainly of active authors in S√£o Paulo. Of this total, there is a particularly relevant set of 240 inventoried works, linked to the production of teachers, students, and graduates, from the foundation of the school to the present day, selected according to their importance within the historical context of the institution, for their relevance. historical, or for its aesthetic and artistic qualities. Painters and sculptors linked to the academic tradition are represented, such as Oscar Pereira da Silva, Rafael Galvez, Paulo Vergueiro Lopes de Le√≥n, Tulio Mugnaini, Alfredo Oliani , Vicente Larocca, Jos√© Wasth Rodrigues and Lu√≠s Morrone (most notably a bronze study of the Monument to Pedro √Ålvares Cabral, in Ibirapuera Park), artists of undefined style or known to synthesize, to a greater or lesser extent, academic characteristics with modern influences, such as Julio Guerra, [Colette Pujol, L√≠via Guimar√£es Lopes and Ricardo Cipicchia, modern painters such as C√≠cero Dias and others linked to the Paulista Artistic Family (namely Cl√≥vis Graciano) and contemporaries such as Fl√°vio Imperio, Renina Katz, Takashi Fukushima, Waldemar Lamb and Ant√¥nio Bandeira. The design core covers topics such as product, graphic and fashion, including objects, posters and design projects. Textile pieces. Noteworthy is a set of drawings by the Dener Pamplona de Abreu, an icon of Brazilian fashion from the 60s and 70s, as well as the Vicente Di Grado Collection, composed of over 300 books illustrated by the former student, teacher and director of the Fine Arts. In the architectural collection, the museum highlights the Eduardo Kneese de Mello Collection, composed of more than 8,000 objects, including Architectural drawings, mockups, photography, slides and documents bequeathed by the architect and former professor of the institution. The historical collection is gathered at the Fine Arts Memory and Documentation Center (Cedoc), linked to the Luciano Octavio Ferreira Gomes Cardim Library, which aims to preserve and disseminate the textual and iconographic documentation of the Fine Arts University Center.

He is known for being close friends with Nikolay Milyutin, who drafted the Russian Emancipation proclamation, and with his brother, Dmitry Milyutin, who was serving as Minister of War. Political Career In 1810, Lanskoy had joined a Freemason lodge, and held important positions until the closing decree of 1822. After this, he was a member of the Union of Prosperity, but was out of it by the disturbances of 1825. His last known secret organization was the Theoretical Degree of the Order of the Golden-Rose Cross, which also remained clandestine throughout his life. He was known particularly for being with the Freemasons and for being \\"with the Brothers\\" (the Milyutins) in Russian society. In this regard, he has also been connected multiple-times with Leo Tolstoy and other Russian Liberals and Constitutionalists who had been involved in Masonic lodges. In the early 1850s, around 1852, Lanskoy had been involved with the reformation of the Russian prison system. He had rejected donations to the prison system for prisoners, until prisoner committees could be established, and then finally gave into the plan for a Krasnoyarsk Prisoners Society, to serve this purpose. In 1855, Lanskoy was behind an initiative to tell Europe about Russia in liberal and progressive hues, establishing Le Nord as a newspaper in Belgium to give air to these views. During a meeting of nobles in 1856, Lanskoy tried to persuade a group of nobles to voluntarily abolish serfdom, because \\"it would be in their interests to grant the serfs emancipation before the peasants rebelled...\\" (which is what actually happened) When Milyutin finally authored the Emancipation Proclamation for Russian serfs in 1861, just a year before Lanskoy's death, Lanksoy's place was considered important.

After being introduced as a private member's bill by Sir Robert Richard Torrens, it was passed by both houses and assented to by the Governor of South Australia, on 27 January 1858. It was the first law in the world to institute what has become known as the Torrens Title system of property law, and is sometimes referred to as the \\"Torrens Title\\" Act 1858. Background Robert Richard Torrens, son of Robert Torrens (economist and chairman of the South Australian Colonisation Commission), had previously worked in the civil service in customs roles in London and Adelaide, before being appointed Colonial Treasurer and Registrar-General from 1852 to 1857. He was elected as a member of the House of Assembly for the City of Adelaide Inactive link - leads to home page. in the new parliament in 1857, and on 1 September 1857 became the third Premier, although his government lasted only a month. For years before his election, he had vigorously promoted the need for land titles reform, with the current system of transfer of land by deed ineffective, slow, expensive and insecure. It relied on verbose and complicated documents that had to be retained at least a century in order to validate new transactions and lawyers were needed to effect the transactions. The second reading of a bill introduced as a private member's bill was carried despite strong opposition, passing through both Houses on 27 January 1858. Enactment The Real Property Act 1858, with the long title \\"An Act to simplify the Laws relating to the transfer and encumbrance of freehold and other interests in Land\\", was assented to on 27 January 1858. At the head of the first page of the transcript, is \\"Anno vicesimo primo Victoriae Reginae, No. 15\\", meaning the 21st year of Queen Victoria's reign, although the first page of the original document says \\"1857‚Äì8, No. 15\\". The Act, eagerly anticipated by many, came into effect on 2 July 1858 and was on the whole well-received, apart from some lawyers who would have noted that the ease and clarity of the process would mean less in earnings for them in the future. (Incorrect naming of \\"Colonel Robert Torrens\\" reported to site.) Torrens was to be appointed Registrar-General in order to assist with the Act's application. In this role he did much to bring about a successful transition to the new system. Temporary offices were set up for applicants to apply to have land brought under the operation of the new Act. An indexed copy of the Act was published in 1858, edited by W.M. Sandford. Effect The Act transferred property by registration of title, instead of by deeds. It radically altered the method of recording and registering land under freehold title. Instead, government certificates were issued and a central register established. This system provided an indisputable record, thus almost eliminating litigation involving land disputes, got rid of difficulties created by lost certificates, and reduced the cost of land sales and transfers. The legislation was refined in the following few years, with Torrens overseeing major amendments to the Act in 1859 and 1862, which included allowing the licensing of registered land brokers instead of lawyers in land transactions, thus further reducing the cost. Four main principles underlie the Act: *Title to land is passed from one owner to another by registration on a public register. *Title is evidenced by a government-issued and -guaranteed certificate issued. *Once registered, the purchase is indefeasible; it cannot be set aside unless fraud is proven on the part of the purchaser. *Land dealers who have been dispossessed of their land unfairly or accidentally are guaranteed compensation. Spread and current legislation The first sale of land registered under the system was to pastoralist William Ransom Mortlock (later elected to the House of AssemblyH. Kempe, 'Mortlock, William Ranson (1821 - 1884)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 5, Melbourne University Press, 1974, pp 301-302.) on 25 August 1858. (Join archive.org and borrow to see whole text.) So successful was the outcome that it was adopted in the rest of Australia and in many countries throughout the world. The system became known as the Torrens Title system, and the Act often referred to as the \\"Torrens Title Act 1858\\". Torrens visited Victoria in 1860 and assisted in bringing in the new system in that colony. He also helped the other colonies to introduce their own variations of the system: Queensland adopted the 1859 version, while New South Wales, Tasmania and Victoria based their legislation on the 1861 reforms. New Zealand, Malaysia and some states in the US followed; it has since been widely adopted throughout the world. In 1862, Torrens published A handy book on the Real Property Act of South Australia:..., which is now available in full online. =Amendments and revisions= The Real Property Act 1860 (23 & 24 Vict. c. 11), \\"An Act to consolidate and amend certain Acts relating to the transfer ad encumbrance of freehold and other interests in land\\" (17 October 1860) (metadata record) and the Real Property Act 1861 (24 & 25 Vict. c. 22), \\"An Act to amend the Real Property Act of 1860\\"(3 December l861) (metadata record) were the main amendments to the Act. In South Australia, the Act was substantially revised in 1886, and this version remains in force in South Australia. The Real Property Act 1886, updated 3 October 2019, has a long title \\"An Act to consolidate and amend the Real Property Act 1861, the Real Property Act Amendment Act 1878 and the Rights-of-Way Act 1881, and for other purposes\\". =Computerisation= South Australia has been a world leader in creating digital versions of property title data since the late 20th century, with its Land Ownership and Tenure System, or LOTS. Credit for the Act Attempts have been made to minimise the credit due to Torrens for his great achievement, and it has been asserted that Anthony Forster, then editor of the South Australian Register, made the original suggestion.Letter to the Editor The Advertiser 8 February 1932 p.10 accessed 3 March 2011 In the preface to his book, The South Australian System of Conveyancing by Registration of Title, published at Adelaide in 1859, Torrens stated that his interest in the question had been aroused 22 years before through the misfortunes of a relation and friend, and that he had been working on the problem for many years. He also said that the idea was based on principles used in transferring shipping property, of which he would have gained experience in his early career as a customs official, both in London and Adelaide (1836‚Äì1852). His experience as Registrar-General (1852‚Äì1858), as a landowner himself, and the influence of politicians such as Forster and W.H. Burford and lawyers such as Richard Bullock Andrews, Henry Gawler and W.C. Belt, would have influenced him close to home. Torrens acknowledged that he had adapted principles from other systems: the system of title registration had been used pre-14th-century Europe, and his research revealed that Bavaria, Austria and Hungary had engaged in this practice for centuries. However, he did not copy those ones, but adapted a system developed for registration of merchant ships in Britain. The owner of the ship was given a certificate, which was surrendered to the registrar when the ship was sold, and the new owner would receive a new one. Torrens was also familiar with a report presented to the British House of Commons on 15 May 1857, supplied by German lawyer Ulrich H√ºbbe who had detailed knowledge of the real property laws of the Hanseatic League cities and whose doctorate in laws from Hamburg University dealt with this topic. His input added to the practical application of the method in law, and Torrens worked on this aspect further. With the support of Carl Muecke and the influential German community, he fought it through Parliament despite violent opposition from the legal profession.

Her letters, written while residing in Russia, were later published and provide historians with valuable first-hand accounts of life at the Russian court in the early 19th century. Early life and family Anne Kennedy was the eldest child of the Hon. Robert Kennedy, a younger son of Archibald Kennedy, 11th Earl of Cassilis. Her mother was Jane Macomb, the daughter of a successful American merchant. The family lived for several years in New Jersey, where Anne was born, before moving their residence to England. On 24 October 1821, she married Edward Cromwell Disbrowe, a British diplomat. The couple met in Switzerland. Their first child was born the year after their marriage in Berne. In late 1822, they returned to England where Edward became a Member of Parliament (MP) for Windsor (1823‚Äì26). The growing family lived in Walton Hall, Derbyshire. They eventually had four surviving children: daughters Charlotte and Jane (who later married Henry Christopher Wise), and sons Edward and William. Life as a diplomatic wife In April 1825, Edward Disbrowe travelled to Saint Petersburg to serve as Minister Plenipotentiary at the court of Tsar Alexander I. Anne followed in June, accompanied by her father. Initially told this would be a short-lived posting, they decided to leave their two young daughters behind in England out of fear the sea journey would be too dangerous. The girls stayed with Anne's parents at Walton Hall. Events at court quickly extended the couple's stay; Tsar Alexander died, which precipitated the Decembrist revolt and Nicholas I's eventual succession. The Disbrowes were then posted to Moscow in 1826, as part of a large English delegation for the new tsar's coronation. As there was no permanent ambassador to Russia in place, Anne was the highest ranking English lady present and had many social duties to perform, further delaying their return home. Anne's letters reveal her anguish at being separated from her children. She and her husband considered sending for them, but worried about the serious risks associated with travel and Russia's climate. Anne would not see them again until her return to England in March 1828, a gap of three years. After Russia, Disbrowe held appointments in W√ºrttemberg and Stockholm, and in 1831 he was knighted into the Royal Guelphic Order. Beginning in January 1836, he and his family moved to The Hague where he served as an envoy. There he fell ill in September 1851, and died on 29 October. His grieving family then returned to England. In his will, he left his widow and two daughters an annuity of ¬£500. The family properties were later divided among both daughters; Walton Hall was inherited by Charlotte, and Jane acquired an estate in Northamptonshire. Their son Edward died in 1854, and according to his sister Charlotte, Anne's \\"health never recovered from that terrible loss\\". Anne died in October of the following year. Legacy Charlotte later published much of her mother's correspondence; these letters have provided historians with valuable first- hand accounts of life at the Russian court in the early 19th century. She edited a collection of letters and had them printed by the Ladies' Printing Press for private publication in 1878, under the name Original Letters from Russia 1825‚Äì1828. Some of these letters were later adapted into another book, Old Days in Diplomacy: Recollections of a Closed Century, published in 1903 by Jarrold & Sons.

Taxonomy The species was first described by Percy Sladen in 1889. Sladen does not specify the etymology of the specific epithet, but states the mottled yellow and dark brown colouration is striking, and likely derived the name from this observation. In 1930 Walter Kenrick Fisher stated that Asterias versicolor was closely related to A. amurensis, but that A. rollestoni might well intergrade with this species to the north of its range. In the same publication Fisher reduced A. rollestoni to a forma of A. amurensis. In 1936 Ryori Hayashi published an account of the species and stated his doubts regarding its distinctiveness compared with A. amurensis, and in the 1940 article Contributions to the Classification of the Sea-stars of Japan Hayashi went through with his suggestion and reduced A. versicolor to a form of A. amurensis, as A. amurensis f. versicolor, considering it to be most similar to A. rollestoni -he ascribed to Fisher's classification of this taxon as A. amurensis f. rollestoni. This classification is still used in Japan (as a subspecies, A. amurensis ssp. versicolor). Alexander Michailovitsch Djakonov in 1950 cites Hayashi's 1936 work in his account of the species, instead of the main 1940 work cited elsewhere in his references, and he was unable to measure specimens personally, so it is somewhat unclear if Djakonov truly rejected Hayashi's classification. Description This starfish has five arms. The disc is robust, convex and with a radius of up to 1.7-1.9cm across. The underside of the animal is flat, and the margin (edge) of especially the arms is sharply angular. It has an arm length to 6.2, 7.1 or 8.2cm, the width of the base of the arm being to 2.2cm; the ratio between the length of the arm and the radius of its disc is 4:1, to slightly more. Fisher states the general colour is yellowish mottled with brown, and implies the smaller immature specimens are mottled dark and light brown. Hayashi specifies the yellowish mottled with brown colouration is in dried museum specimens. Sladen specifies that when the specimens are preserved in alcohol the colouration is bleached yellowish-white on the underside and bleached yellowish-white mottled with dark chocolate brown on the topside. There is a single spine arising from each patch of yellowish skin, with the dark brown patches being in the spineless areas in between. The dorsal (carinal) spines are small but robust, 1-1.2mm long, end in a truncated, sometimes channelled or otherwise crenellated point, and are arranged in a rough stripe down the top of each arm. These spines are affixed to the dorsal plates of the exoskeleton, and on the skin appear to occupy the centre of a low, broad, slightly convex bump. The dorsolateral spines are somewhat larger and widely spaced. The marginal spines are even wider spaced and somewhat larger, 1.7-2mm long, and the plates below the margin bear two shorter, robust spines each. The straight pedicellariae are relatively small, slender, 0.2‚Äì0.22mm long, and scattered over the dorsal surface. The crossed (forcipiform) pedicellariae are also slender, and clustered in wreaths or circles around the bases of the dorsal to the marginal spines. It has planktonic larvae. Juveniles have the same spination as the adults on the top of the disc, but gradually grow more spines towards the margin as they increase in size. The size of the spines which are present appear relatively larger than those of adults. The margins of the arms are less sharply angular. When the arms reach 1.5cm in length the final adult spines appear, the double spines below the margin. When the starfish grows slightly larger the position of the spines shift into a fully adult formation. =Similar species= Sladen considered it a close ally of Asterias amurensis, being separated from this species by the spines on the plates below the margin and the character of the armature. Verrill and Hayashi find it is the most similar to A. rollestoni; according to Verrill differing from this species by having less spines and shorter and blunter pedicellaria; Hayashi pointing to the somewhat more robust skeleton, the single spine per dorsal plate, and the smaller and more slender pedicellaria. Fisher agrees with both views, noting it is \\"obviously related\\" to A. amurensis and possibly conspecific with A. rollestoni (a form of A. amurensis according to him), but \\"perfectly distinct from both\\". Distribution The holotype was collected in the sea off Kobe in Japan by the 1873‚Äì1876 scientific expedition by the H.M.S. Challenger, these waters having depths of 8‚Äì50 fathoms according to Sladen in 1889, from which Djakonov derived his depth range of 14.5 to 91.5m for the species in 1950. It is native to the southern coasts of Japan including Toyama Bay and the Seto Inland Sea, and has also been found southwards to north Taiwan, around Hong Kong and in the South China Sea. It was first recovered on seabeds with mud and sand substrates.

It is also referred to as Bacha Gyavaun in certain parts of Kashmir. Afghans of Kabul are credited with the parentage of this dance. It is a derivative of the Hafiza Nagma. During the Bacha Nagma, a teenaged boy dressed as a girl dancer, who is trained in the Hafiza style of dancing sings Kashmiri Ballad and dances. This dance is popular in the villages, mainly at the harvest time. It is also popular for being performed in social gatherings and parties by young boys who disguise themselves as women in long skirts. Bacha Nagma is common in Kashmir during wedding celebrations and when the wedding processions are taken out on boats on the Jhelum river. This dance form is much appreciated and has the ability to engage large audiences. It is accompanied by instruments like rabab, sarangi, and drums. It involves quick spinning movements just like in the Hafiza dance form and some may even resemble those of kathak. The song- dance proceeding is known as Bach Nagma Jashan - Kid Dancer's Celebration. The dancer is known as The Bacha - the Kid - usually a thin and graceful boy/man who dances, sometimes comically, is always attired like a woman in a multi- colored frock-like dress. This dance occupies a very special place in the folklore of Kashmir and is performed during parties where people socialize with each other. too, The dance is also conducted during festivals and religious occasions. The audience is entertained by the rejoicing movements of the performers accompanied by very loud music. This folk dance form was one of the most prevalent ways of entertainment in the old days. With the passage of time, there come up in many ways by which people entertain themselves. The Bacha Nagma dance has still existed as a folk dance form and is considered one of the prime components of the Kashmiri culture. Before the Bacha Nagma, another type of celebration was much more popular - Hafiz Nagma, ‚ÄòFemale dancer‚Äôs song‚Äô.  Etymology  The term \\"Bacha Nagma\\" is derived from two different words, Bacha: From Persian ÿ®⁄ÜŸá‚Äé (baƒçƒçe). Ultimately from Sanskrit ‡§µ‡§§‡•ç‡§∏ (vatsa, \\"boy, child, son\\"), from which Hindi ‡§¨‡§õ‡§°‡§º‡§æ (bach·πõƒÅ, \\"calf, child, boy\\") is derived and Nagma: From Urdu ŸÜÿßÿ¨ŸÖÿß, Hindi: ‡§®‡§ò‡§Æ‡§æ meaning a melody or a tune. Combined altogether means the child's dance.  History  The valley of Kashmir is appreciated for its rich culture and the various folk dance forms which can still be seen. Kashmir was predominantly populated by Muslims and has remained aloof from the main cultural currents of India, but the ancient caves and temples of Kashmir reveal a strong link with Indian culture at the beginning of the Common Era. At one time the classical dances of the south are believed to have been practiced. When Islam was introduced in the 14th century, dancing and theatrical arts were suppressed, being contrary to a strict interpretation of the Qur æƒÅn. These arts survived only in folk forms and were performed principally at marriage ceremonies. The history of the Bacha Nagma folk dance form says that the dance evolved many years ago as a dance form that was being performed during the harvest season to celebrate the joy of harvesting. However, it gradually gained popularity among the people and is now being performed at social gatherings, parties, and get-togethers, as well as during religious occasions and festivals. Another dance form is known as the Hafiz Nagma- ‚ÄòFemale dancer‚Äôs Song‚Äô was prevalent before the Bacha Nagma. Its performance was similar to Bacha Nagma, and the songs were usually set to Sufi lyrics or Sufia Kalam, but the dancer who performed on these songs was always female and known as Hafiza. These dancers were much celebrated at weddings and festivals. This dance form was eventually replaced by the Bacha Nagma, with different reasons given for this happening. A belief among the locals is that the concept of boys dancing in female attire had a historical significance which dates back during the rule of the Mughal emperor Akbar. After Kashmir was captured by Akbar, he wanted to diminish the gallantry of the men residing in the place. To accomplish it, he enforced the men to dress up like the women, to prevent them from disclosing their heroism and bravery. Kashmiris believe that Mughal Emperor Akbar, in an attempt to counter manly valor of its people and remove any possible future trouble, decree-forced Kashmiri men to were feminine gown like dresses - pheran. Then, in 1920s Hafiz Nagma was banned officially in Kashmir by the ruling Dogra Maharaja. The ruler felt this dance was losing its Sufi touch and was becoming too sensual and hence amoral for the society. With songs being the same, the female Muslim dancers were replaced by young Muslim boys who dressed as women, giving the origin of Bacha Nagma. Few studies by the respected academic personnel reveal that this dance form was mainly promoted by the Afghans in Kabul. The dancers did not only wear the dress of a woman but they also beautified themselves with various ornaments and jewelry. The dance movements are performed with such dignity and expertise that it is almost impossible to distinguish the boys with that of the dance performances of girls. It is a distinct credit of the young boys, dancing and singing simultaneously with the music. These young boys are trained as soon as they reach their adolescent age to maintain the sweetness and the shrillness in their voice. During the modern era, there have been several alterations in the song and the dance. Form Bacha Nagma is an offshoot to the Hafiza dance form. It is considered very popular and draws attention of large amount of crowd and applause. It also involves quick spinning movements like that in Kathak. The dancers do much of an expressional dancing to interpret the lyrics of the song being sung. Nowadays marriages Kashmir in are considered incomplete without Bacha Nagma performance. The groups are booked a couple of months before the events. During the ceremony, the ‚ÄòBacha‚Äô gets more people on the dance floor and is then customarily showered with money. The singing takes place all night and the Ghungroos add to the aesthetic nature of the song. There are songs of different patterns, like Erotic, Humorous, Pathetic, Heroic, Spiritual, Peaceful and Wondrous. Many different type of rasas (emotions) are present in these songs sung by the bacha and which are then expressed beautifully through the dancing. Performance The dance is usually performed by highly skilled and brilliant young performers. Each one of them is skilled and accomplished in their genre of dance. These extremely well talented young boys are made to look like women with local traditional women's attire and make-up. The dancers follow the Hafiza style of dance. They receive adequate and expert training to adopt the Hafiza dance form of Kashmir. A common feature noticed in these young teenagers is that they have the supple body so that they can easily adapt the flexible moves like that of female dancers in Hafiza. Since these boys are of tender age they have sweeter voice and thus, they can as well sing while dancing. They are trained to retain that voice too. The sweetness in their voice makes the music very much soothing and creates a very nice ambiance. It consists of six to seven members (maximum) and there is no particular singer, one of the dancers himself is the lead singer among the dancers that sings in a melodious voice and the other members join him in the chorus, this creates a very soothing effect as most of the singers are young in age. The dresses worn by dancers somewhat resemble those worn by Kathak dancers. Their face is beautifully adorned to represent that of a girl. The dancers move around the dance stage with wonderful dignified movements. The poised nature of the dance, simple yet lively, enthralls the audience.  Music and Instruments  Chhakri musicians playing Kashmiri folk songs with chhakri instruments. The songs are similar to the ones that are sung with the Hafiza dance i.e. songs written in Sufi Kalam or lyrics. Sufi Kalam is a song form, dedicated to the divine power and spirit. Other songs used contain lyrics that resemble the Persian style of literature. Nowadays the lyrics are composed to represent a fun theme or a comedy, to allure the observers. The music is loud and is an inherent part of the dance form. Without the music, the performance does not attain its exquisite charm and sophistication. A Sufi Kalam performance consists of an ustad, and three musicians (all of the vocalists and instrumentalists) introducing the shakal (alaap) before presenting the baeth (mystic and/or romantic verses) of a maqaam (raga). Sufi Kalam was the music form favored by the elite, while the masses enjoyed traditional forms of folk music like Chhakri, Rof, and Wanwun. Chhakri is folk music sung to the accompaniment of sarang, rabab, tumbaknari and nott. Bacha Nagma is accompanied by the Chhakri singers and instruments and the Sufi kalam slowly faded away. A ballad in Kashmiri was sung for the story is told and not merely as dance-accompaniments. Sometimes for the sake of entertainment, dance was also performed along with the singing of a narrative song which became a local practice for the Bacha Nagma singers.

This piece of armor belongs in the Arms and Armor Department of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. History From 1185 to 1333, the Kamakura shogunate was dominated by members of the Minamoto clan, the Fujiwara clan, minor princes of the Imperial family, and members of the Hojo clan. The collapse of the Hojo clan was a result of the Genk≈ç War, where power of the Kamakura shogunate was temporarily transferred to Emperor Go- Daigo in the Kenmu Restoration, the return of Imperial rule. The restoration lasted only three years, to be replaced by Takauji, who marched into Kyoto and later ousted Go-Daigo in the Battle of Minatogawa. The armor was enshrined within the Shinomura Hachimang≈´ (ÁØ†ÊùëÂÖ´Âπ°ÂÆÆ) in Kameoka, Kyoto, for over 570 years. It is believed to be a donation made by Takauji during a ten-day stay at the shrine, prior to engaging Go-Daigo's forces.

Armor The o-yoroi was generally worn by samurai on horseback, typically possessing a cuirass and a four-sided skirt. The yoroi also had white silk and rainbow lacings, representing beauty and fortune. The breastplate is decorated with a representation of the fire deity Fudo Myoo, accompanied by boy servants Kimkara and Cetaka, representing calmness and inner strength.

The fritters are eaten mainly at breakfast or as a snack at teatime, served at tea shops and hawker stands alike. They are typically served as standalone snacks dipped in a sour-sweet tamarind-based sauce, or as toppings for common Burmese dishes.

Sykes had enjoyed one hell of a comeback as an internationally acclaimed master of the blues; he toured extensively, playing tiny saloons and massive music festivals, even recording at times with electrically amplified instrumental backing. All throughout the second half of the 1970s, the one-man, one-piano Hard Drivin' Blues album was warmly received by those lucky enough to have caught Sykes live and in person, and it still stands as one of the very finest recordings in his entire discography ...There are plenty of Roosevelt Sykes albums to choose from; this one is essential, fundamental, and indispensable.\\".

Personal life and education Wiggs was born to parents Dolores Ray and Russell L. Wiggs Jr. in Washington, DC. Wiggs was inspired by a high school teacher to focus on both biology and chemistry. As a freshman at University of California at Berkeley, she originally wished to major in chemical engineering until she discovered lac operon in biology class. After earning her doctorate in biochemistry from the University of California at Berkeley, Wiggs was awarded the Pearl and Martin Silverstein academic scholarship in Health Sciences and Technology to attend the Harvard Medical School. Afterwards, she married Eric Stephen Schreiber in a Jewish ceremony before divorcing and marrying her second husband Robert D'Amato. Career In 1988, Wiggs and other researchers published a paper titled \\"Prediction of the risk of hereditary retinoblastoma, using DNA polymorphisms within the retinoblastoma gene\\" that aimed to identify the gene for retinoblastoma. She shortly thereafter joined the Massachusetts Eye and Ear hospital in 1992 and eventually became Co-Director of the HMS Ophthalmology Glaucoma Center of Excellence and Director of the Genetic Testing Lab. In 2015, Wiggs made major discoveries and earned promotions within her profession. She was promoted to the Paul Austin Chandler Professor of Ophthalmology at Harvard, and was inducted into the Academia Ophthalmologica Internationalis for her research on glaucoma. As principal investigator for NEI Glaucoma Human Genetics Collaboration Heritable Overall Operational Database (NEIGHBORHOOD), Wiggs was the lead author on the article, ‚ÄúGenome-wide association analysis identifies TXNRD2, ATXN2 and FOXC1 as susceptibility loci for primary open-angle glaucoma‚Äù which identified three genes that contribute to primary open-angle glaucoma. Wiggs and her research team also used NEIGHBORHOOD Consortium to study glaucoma genetics. They collected consortium has collected over 5,000 samples from primary open-angle glaucoma patients, as well as 30,000 control samples, to try and narrow down on genes that play a role in many forms of glaucoma. She is also investigating the genetic etiologies of early-onset and adult forms of glaucoma and is a founding member of the International Glaucoma Genetics Consortium (IGGC). In 2018, Wiggs was awarded the 2018 Dr. David L. Epstein Award, which came with a $100,000 research award. Later, Wiggs was elected to the National Academy of Medicine for her research in the field of ocular genetics.

Early Life Faloon was born to a Presbyterian family and at age 8, was told by his mother that everyone eventually dies, an idea he refused to believe, sparking his interest in human immortality. At age 13, a local newspaper article about Robert Ettinger aroused his interest in the prospect of cryonics. After learning of Alcor Life Extension Foundation, at age 15, Faloon decided to take a life insurance policy out on himself, naming his mother as the beneficiary so that if he died, she could use those funds to cryogenically preserve him. Faloon pursued his higher education at the Pittsburgh Institute of Mortuary Science, completing a one-year mortuary science program, in hopes of being able to cryopreserve others. A few years later, around 1974, he moved to South Florida to assist in the setup of Neptune Society. Career In 1977, Faloon and Saul Kent co-founded the Florida Cryonics Association (to become Life Extension Foundation in 2000) as a way to promote cryopreservation research. In 1980, the organization transformed into not only funding research and promoting their cause through a monthly newsletter, but also selling and manufacturing supplements after receiving $100,000 from Stephen Ruddel, a real estate tycoon. After Faloon's appearance on Merv Griffin's show in 1982, his popularity, and that of his company, rose exponentially.\\"South Florida Church Pursues Eternal Life Through Cryonics, Inflaming Critics and the IRS\\", Miami New Times, 12 May 2015. Retrieved on 15 January 2020 As the success of his business rose, so did the attention of the local Hollywood police and in 1986, the SWAT team raided Ruddel's office, where cocaine was found and Ruddel pled guilty to drug- possession charges. This did not deter Faloon or Kent, who continued selling nutritional supplements through their warehouse, and on February 26, 1987, the FDA raided Life Extension's office and warehouse, seizing all of their supplements, claiming that the company was selling unapproved drugs to consumers. On November 7, 1991, another raid, this time on Life Extension's Arizona facility, landed both Faloon and Kent in jail (they turned themselves in at a courthouse in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida) on over two dozen counts of conspiring and importing unapproved drugs. They were both released the next day on a $825,000 bond each.

It was constructed in the late 19th century and destroyed during the Warsaw Uprising in 1944. It is known for an eponymous wartime song, Pa≈Çacyk Michla, which was written by poet and insurgent J√≥zef Szczepa≈Ñski.  History  The term palace is colloquial, and the building was a townhouse (built in the eclecticism style) rather than formally a palace. It was nicknamed in such a way because it stood out as a high quality, decorative construction amidst its more mundane surroundings. The building belonged to Karol Michler, a merchant, miller and entrepreneur, who also had a small food factory in its vicinity, producing pasta and bread. The factory was taken over by Nazi Germany following their invasion of Poland in 1939. During the Warsaw Uprising of 1944, the building was the site of intense fighting around August 4 and 5 involving the Parasol Battalion insurgent unit. Insurgent poet J√≥zef Szczepa≈Ñski, a member of the Parasol unit, wrote a song (Pa≈Çacyk Michla) about those events, performing it in its vicinity on the evening of August 4. The song, published shortly afterward in an insurgent newspaper, quickly taken up by the partisans, was performed for them by a popular singer Mieczys≈Çaw Fogg, and later, became known across Poland. On the next day the Germans captured the building, which, damaged in the fighting, was demolished shortly after. The song has been called Szczepa≈Ñski's most famous song, and its tune was based on an earlier, pre-war song by the Slovak composer Jan ≈†≈•astn√Ω. In 2007, a monument commemorating the building and the fighting that took place during the Uprising was unveiled near the building's former location on Wolska Street.

The sex market is defined as the system of supply and demand which is generated by the existence of sex work as a commodity. The sex market can further be segregated into the direct sex market, which mainly applies to prostitution, and the indirect sex market, which applies to sexual businesses which provide services such as lap dancing. The final component of the sex market lies in the production and selling of pornography. With the distinctions between feminist perspectives, there are many documented instances from feminist authors of both explicit and implied feminist standpoints that provide coverage on the sex market in regards to both \\"autonomous\\" and \\"non-autonomous\\" sex trades. The quotations are added since some feminist ideology believe the commodification of women's bodies is never autonomous and therefore subversive or misleading by terminology.  Feminist responses to sex market  = Radical feminism = Radical feminism views prostitution, and by extension the sex market, as the ideal demonstration of women being subordinated and subjected to violence through the patriarchy's market demands. The notable radical feminist Andrea Dworkin argues that the sexual subordination of women must be overcome for gender equality to be achieved. The sex market, which renders the woman's body a commodity, is therefore incompatible with radical feminism. Some radical feminists argue that the sex market, by breaking down the barrier between sexual activity against commercialization and production, degrades the sexual autonomy women socially hold. The lack of autonomy in the sex market stems from the inhumane treatment sex workers often face, the social and economic power discrepancy between the consumers and providers of sexual services and content, and the perpetuation of the subordination of women through the sex market's high demand. This falls in line with the view radical feminists hold about capitalist societies as containing a 'moral' economy, in which the economically permitted actions embodies societal beliefs about individual autonomy. Within the framework of moral appeals, the sex market meets its unambiguous and nondiscretionary fulfillment of its obligations to consumers at the expense of female sexual autonomy. = Liberal feminism = Liberal feminism views a capitalist democracy as capable and inclined to enacting laws which protect individual rights as it pertains to gender discrimination, and this includes protecting women who work within sex markets. As the feminist author Martha Nussbaum argues, the reason that sex markets see such high instances of undermined female autonomy and sexual wellness is due to the social stigmatization which is rooted in the fear of female sexual expression, and that the services of the sex market should be respected as any other form of labor. Nussbaum's argument concludes that the stigmatization of sex markets only directly negatively impacts sex workers without addressing the underlying social oppression towards women. There is disagreement between liberal feminists as to whether or not sex work is degrading to women, but it is generally agreed upon that legalizing the sex market would be positive, as it would grant women who work within the sex market greater protections under the legal system. This would come in the form of granting women safer spaces to work, and allow the government to limit and regulate unsafe, exploitative practices against sex workers. The legalization of sex work also grants sex workers the autonomy to decide what they wish to do with their bodies, which is a tenant of liberal feminism. = Dominance feminism = Dominance feminism views the political, social, and economic structure of the world are discriminatory against women on account of the concerted efforts of the patriarchy, and therefore the discrimination against women in the sex markets manifests as a byproduct of male domination. As the dominance feminist author Catharine A. MacKinnon holds, the sex market cannot be viewed as feminist on account of men's sexual domination over women being the main factor upon which the market functions. Prostitution and the sex market is viewed more broadly as a state which all women are involuntarily entered into due to a woman's sexuality being the object through which men can barter and legislate over. Due to the nature of the sex market as primarily selling female produced content or female bodies, which are often sold to men as clients through male brokers, prostitution and pornography are the highest forms of women's exploitation. Dominance feminists might also view prostitution as inherently negative due to the belief that women's self-expression through sexuality cannot ever be sold without the patron's perception of the commodity as being discriminatory against female autonomy.  Sex market across the world  = Netherlands: Amsterdam = Statue to honor the sex workers of the world. Installed March 2007 in Amsterdam, Oudekerksplein, in front of the Oude Kerk, in Amsterdam's red-light district De Wallen. Title is Belle, inscription says \\"Respect sex workers all over the world.\\" The notable neighborhood of De Wallen in Amsterdam is home to the Netherland's legalized red-light district, which is a commercial hub for the sex market. Through the legalization and regulation of the sex market, the Dutch government has been capable of cutting back on organized crime within the red-light district without encroaching on the rights of sex workers, who are still protected by the law. Although the intentions are politically well meaning, most projections for the decriminalization projects of the region are projected to displace and therefore endanger sex workers, which seems to prove the point liberal feminists make about stigmatization on a governmental level as endangering to prostitutes.

Its students were mostly of Russian ethnicity, including Russian-Uzbek orientalist Mikhail Stepanovich Andreev. Seminary The Tashkent Teacher's Seminary, initially called the Teacher's Seminary of Turkestan, opened in 1879 to train teachers in Turkestan. Most students were the children of Russian immigrants in Turkestan, and the number of studnets from the local indigenous population of the region was insignificant. In 1886, out of 61 studnets, only 9 were of local Central Asian ethnicities, and in 1883-1904, out of 254 graduates from the seminary, only 39 were of local ethnicities. After the Russian Revolution and since 1918, the school was used for preparing teachers for Soviet Uzbek schools. In 1920, the Uzbek Male Institute of Education was transformed into the Regional Uzbek Institute of Education.Letters on Tashkent Students at the seminary studied The Law of God (Orthodox Christian legal discipline), Pedagogy, the Russian language, Arithmetic, Algebra, Geometry, Physics, Natural Sciences, General History, Geography, Drawing, Calligraphy, Singing, Music, Needlework, Gymnastics, the Kazakh language, and the Persian language. Since 1884, with the efforts of Vladimir Nalivkin, the seminary began to teach the Uzbek language, which replaced Kazakh. Nalivkin was the first teacher of systematic courses on the Uzbek and Persian (Tajik) languages, compiling an anthology, dictionaries, a grammar book, and textbooks in these languages. Initially, the seminary was located in the house of Colonel Tartakovsky, rebuilt according to the plans of Alexei Benois from 1881 to 1887.E. G. Zhanov - \\"Turkestan\\" Benois In 1887, a new building for the seminary was built in Konstantinovsky Square (Emir Timur Square). Under the Soviet Union, the building housed the City Health Department of the Tashkent Executive Committee. Church of St. Alexander Nevsky In 1898, E. P. Dubrovin, according to a plan drawn out by Alexei Benois, built a five-domed church in the name of Saint Alexander Nevsky in the Western part of the seminary building. The Church was closed in the 1930s and its domes were demolished. However, the building itself continued to be used for various needs. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the building became privately owned and operated as an office building. The former church was an architectural monument and had a protected status, and it was in relatively good condition. Despite this, on the weekend of November 18th to November 21st, 2009, it was demolished on the decision of city authorities in order to free up space for new construction projects.Demolition of the building of the Orthodox Church of the XIX century in Tashkent: Details // IA REGNUM, November 25, 2009.An Orthodox church was Demolished in Tashkent and Monuments were Dismantled in Honor of the Victory in the Great Patriotic War // Russian Observer, November 23, 2009.

They began in 1909 and folded in the early 2000s due to a lack of playing numbers. At the start of the 1920 season they were renamed Devonport United when they amalgamated with the Sunnyside club. It was proposed at the merger that they be known as North Shore Albions but Sunnyside objected and the name of Devonport United was chosen. In 1937, 17 years later at their annual general meeting they decided to revert to the name \\"North Shore Albions\\" as they had been commonly referred to as \\"shore\\" for many years. Chairman H Mann made the proposal and it was adopted by the club. Aside from Northcote they were the only club on the North Shore at that time. They closed their doors in 2005. The only remaining club connected to them are the Northern Brothers who are based at Ngataringa Bay Sports Field. Their senior team is an amalgamation of East Coast Bays Barracudas and Glenfield Greyhounds but are based more in the North Shore Albions traditional area which includes the navy ground which has provided many players and teams over the years. The predominant colours are black and green which have been common colours of all the North Shore clubs over the decades. History They were formed in 1909 when the Auckland Rugby League competition was in its infancy, having its own first General Meeting that same season. They were officially born on the evening of 23 July 1909 when a meeting was held at the Devonport Council Chambers. The following people were elected officers for the inaugural season: President ‚Äì Dr. Guinness, Vice Presidents ‚Äì Dr. Bennett, Captain Pilkington, Mr W. Swinnerton, Mr. A. Goldwater, and Mr. D. W. McLean, Committee ‚Äì Mr. F. Gladding, Mr. P. Gerrard, Mr. Clark, Mr. Marshall, Mr. Wells, and Mr. Powell, with Mr. A. J. Powley the Secretary and Treasurer. They played in the first ever rugby league match between two Auckland club teams when they played City Rovers at Eagleton's Paddock in Epsom. North Shore put out a strong side and won the match by 44 points to 22. Their team was made up of the following players: F. Neighbour, F. Gladding, Richard Wynyard, Gerrard, George Seagar, Frank Woodward, Griffin, B. Wells, Allen, C. Wells, Percival, Shaw, McReynolds, Marshall, Powell, William Wynyard, McDonald, and Stevens. They also played one match on the Devonport Domain that year against a combined town team which they won by 26 points to 10. Titles They were particularly successful in their early years. They won the senior grade 6 times from 1913 to 1941, while they won the minor premiership (Rukutai Shield) 4 times from 1940 to 1955. As Auckland grew and the North Shore gentrified North Shore struggled to remain the power house it once was and it dropped down the grades. Its last notable title was the Norton Cup which they won in 1990 and 1991.

Humphreys is an American observational stellar astrophysicist. She is Professor Emerita at the University of Minnesota. Her work has included Galactic structure, observational stellar evolution, stellar populations, and large databases. She is best known for her research on massive stars in the Milky Way and in nearby resolved galaxies. She is an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society, a recipient of the Humboldt Senior Scientist Award, and a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. In 2000, Asteroid 10172 was named Humphreys by her former student Jeffrey Larsen.  Early life and education  Humphreys was born and raised in Indiana. She received an AB in Astronomy from Indiana University in 1965. She then went to University of Michigan where she received an MS in Astronomy in 1967 and a Ph.D. in Astronomy in 1969. Subsequently, she completed her post-doctoral training at Vanderbilt University and at the Steward Observatory, University of Arizona with Bart Bok.  Career  Humphreys joined University of Minnesota in 1972 as an Assistant Professor, becoming Associate Professor in 1976 and Full Professor in 1983. In 2001, she was named a Distinguished Professor in the College of Science and Engineering. From 2002 to 2007, she served as the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs of the College of Science and Engineering at University of Minnesota. In 2017, Humphreys became Professor Emerita at University of Minnesota. = Research and work = In 1979, Roberta Humphreys and Kris Davidson published a comparison of the luminous (massive) star populations in our region of the Galaxy and in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) that revealed comparable populations of massive stars in these two galaxies. The most important result was their recognition of an empirical upper luminosity boundary or upper limit in the luminosity vs temperature diagrams, i.e. the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) Diagram. This empirical boundary, often referred to in the astronomical literature as the Humphreys-Davidson Limit, was not predicted by theory or the stellar structure models and evolutionary tracks. The lack of evolved stars above a certain luminosity implies an upper limit to the masses of stars, at about 50 - 60 times the mass of the Sun, that can evolve to become red supergiants thus altering the previously expected evolution of the most massive stars across the HR Diagram. They suggested that the most massive hot stars could not evolve to cooler temperatures because of their instabilities resulting in high mass loss. This mass loss could be unsteady and much greater at times resulting in high mass loss events. Her later research has been focused on the final stages of massive stars evolution often dominated by high mass loss events as observed in eta Carinae, and the warm and cool hypergiants such as VY CMa and IRC +10420. She also led the Automated Plate Scanner research group for over twenty years. They produced an on-line searchable catalog of the digitized scans of the famous Palomar Observatory Sky Survey, and were the first group to use neural networks to separate the images of stars and galaxies. The on-line catalog contains fundamental data and image parameters for over 90 million stars and galaxies.  Awards and honors  *1976-1980 - Alfred P.

It is situated northeast of Whistler, and its nearest higher peak is Wedge Mountain, to the south, which is the only peak within the park higher than Weart. The Armchair Glacier rests below the west aspect of the summit, and the massive Weart Glacier spans the northern and eastern aspects of the mountain. Precipitation runoff from the peak and meltwater from the glaciers drains into Wedgemount Lake and tributaries of the Lillooet River. History Originally known by the mountaineering community as Armchair Mountain or The Armchair, the Garibaldi Park Board submitted the name \\"Mount Weart\\" in 1928, after their board's chairman at the time, John Walter Weart (1861-1941). The mountain's name was officially adopted on September 2, 1930, by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. The first ascent of the mountain was made in 1932 by B. Cook and P. Tait. Climate Mt. Weart from Whistler Mountain Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Mount Weart is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Coast Mountains where they are forced upward by the range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall. As a result, the Coast Mountains experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Temperatures can drop below ‚àí20 ¬∞C with wind chill factors below ‚àí30 ¬∞C. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for climbing Weart.

In early September 2019, Facebook introduced the fact check mechanism in Hong Kong, in the hope of suppressing fake news via collaboration with Agence France-Presse and gatekeeping of senior reporters. They would validate the trustfulness of the news and information shared via Facebook. On 11 September, Facebook restricted Dot Dot News account; after launching an appeal, Facebook restored the page, but banned it again on 13 September. Dot Dot News launched a new page on 14 September, claiming censorship by Facebook. On 13 September, their Facebook page was deleted again. Dot Dot News launch the pages of 2.0 and 3.0, but both were gradually deleted. Facebook warned that if they repeat their behaviour, the relevant personal account would also be banned. On 20 September, They opened another Facebook page named ÈªûÊñ∞ËÅûdotdotnewsmedia, and claimed they would fight against unreasonable suppression. Wen Wei Po criticized Facebook for suppressing the press freedom and cut the Hong Kong citizens from getting rational and patriotic messages. Dot Dot News' case was reported on by media outlets locally and across the globe including SCMP, CNN, Global Times as well as Pro-Beijing media outlets HKGPao and Silent Majority. Global Times quoted an anonymous analyst, which suggested including Facebook into part of the unreliable entity list.

The station shut down when its license was revoked by the Federal Communications Commission after the principal owner failed to notify the agency of an ownership transfer weeks prior to signing on. An unrelated radio station, WLRO, signed on in December 1969 using the same transmitter as WWIZ; it continues on the air today as WDLW.  History  The second AM station in Lorain County, WWIZ signed on October 26, 1958. It was the first radio station to directly serve the city of Lorain, with studios in the city's downtown and a transmitter residing in adjacent Sheffield Township. The station was founded by Sanford A. Schafitz, a native of the Youngstown area; Schafitz also started up WFAR in Farrell, Pennsylvania and WXTV, an independent TV station in Youngstown. Among the early radio hosts at \\"W-WIZ\\" included Bob Lockwood, Alan Mink, Jeff Baxter (who doubled as program director), Bob Lee and Bob \\"BJ\\" Sellers, later known as \\"The Polka King\\", in the morning slot. While the station soon promoted itself as \\"Lorain's Most Listened to Radio Station\\", behind the scenes, WWIZ's history was troubled right from the start. On September 15, 1958‚Äîone month before the station signed on‚ÄîSchafitz arranged a deal with The Journal in Lorain. The Journal, as it turned out, was a party that actually tried to get the station assigned in the first place via a complicated straw-man transaction designed to circumvent the legal requirements which prevented Journal Publishing from holding a license. The station was incorporated as \\"WWIZ, Inc.\\", and while the Journal was not the controlling shareholder of WWIZ (the ratio was 55 percent to 45 percent in favor of Schafitz, who now held the titles of president and director), it ended up controlling the operations nonetheless. (It later emerged that The Journal had avoided 100 percent ownership in order to avoid jeopardizing its chances at buying WCLW of Mansfield; that sale application was later dismissed.) In return for the authorized nonvoting and voting preferred stock, The Journal paid Schafitz a total of $56,000, a transaction later cited by the FCC as a means to finance WXTV's construction, and also for The Journal to get a competitive edge over the Elyria-Lorain Broadcasting Co., owner of WEOL AM/FM. Schafitz, however, told the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) that he held total control of the station at the time, and the deal was not made public until announced on February 26, 1959. Harry Horvitz, chief owner of Journal Publishing, then bought the station outright on June 20, 1961. Both WEOL and the FCC soon objected to the move, as neither was properly notified of the previous action. WWIZ's license renewal was designated for hearing by the FCC in March 1962 as part of a review of all of Schafitz's holdings; at the Youngstown TV station, it was revealed that Schafitz also failed to disclose to the agency that WXTV's 50 percent owner, Guy W. Gully, was indicted for a felony. Also in question was Schafitz's status of involvement at WWIZ; the FCC found that his time devoted to the operations decreased dramatically after its first six months on the air to the point he spent no time at the station from May 1960 onward. The FCC's Broadcast Bureau's findings stated that Schafitz was willing to sell a share in WWIZ to The Journal and Horvitz \\"upon such conditions as Horvitz would dictate\\" and concluded that neither Schafitz, Horvitz nor The Journal had the character qualifications to hold a broadcast license. Hearing examiner Chester F. Naumowicz, Jr., initially recommended renewal of the WWIZ license. On March 25, 1964, the FCC issued the decision to deny the license renewals of WWIZ and WXTV and ordered them off the air by June 1. However, the FCC allowed the license for WFAR to be renewed, finding that its programming was satisfactory; it continues operations to this day as WLOA. (In 1965, in a first-of-its-kind decision, a federal appeals court ruled that the FCC was in its right to allow WFAR to continue even while denying the WWIZ renewal, saying that the FCC's investigation had generally found \\"favorable\\" findings regarding the Farrell operation.) WXTV's channel allocation was reassigned to Alliance as an educational frequency and was eventually occupied by WNEO. The license denial for WWIZ was appealed before the Supreme Court and ultimately was upheld in late 1966. The station was allowed to remain on the air on a temporary basis until being ordered silent on July 14, 1967; a WWIZ staff announcer arrived at the studios the next day and found it was no longer broadcasting. Schafitz died of heart failure on May 30, 1979, at the age of 53. =1380 after WWIZ= Even while WWIZ remained on the air, applications reached the FCC to operate a new station on the frequency it was about to vacate. The first of these, filed in May 1966, came from Lorain Community Broadcasting, with Allied Broadcasting following closely thereafter. They were soon joined by Midwest Broadcasting; all three applications were placed in comparative hearing. All three applicants sought to operate the 1380 facility on an interim basis until the FCC selected a permanent licensee, but since the Lorain Community and Midwest applicants did not want to associate with Allied, which had alleged connections with principals of The Journal, the FCC denied their applications. The FCC initially ruled in favor of Midwest Broadcasting in August 1967, but in June 1968, it reversed its decision and granted the Lorain Community Broadcasting application instead. Lorain selected new WLRO call letters for its station (for LoRain, Ohio). 1380 returned to the air December 4, 1969, when WLRO received program authority to begin broadcasts; it would receive its full license in 1970.

He was known for his prints of mountains and people who live in them.  Biography  Azechi was born on December 28, 1902 to a poor farming family in what is now Uwajima, Ehime. He enrolled in an art correspondence course where he would send his work to Tokyo for critique. In 1920 he had the opportunity to move there, but returned home to Shikoku after the 1923 Great Kant≈ç earthquake. He moved back to Tokyo in 1925, where he worked for a printing company. Azechi's prints were noticed by Unichi Hiratsuka, who took him under his wing. He belonged to the Japan Print Association and the Kokugakai Arts Association. After his works were shown in some of their exhibitions, he quit his job and became a freelance artist. During this time, he was heavily influenced by and K≈çshir≈ç Onchi. During World War II, Azechi was sent to Manchuria. When he returned to Japan, he also immediately returned to making art. Azechi's work was shown at the S√£o Paulo Art Biennial in 1953. It was also shown at the Lugano International Print Biennial in 1956. Azechi died on April 12, 1999. The Umetaro Azechi memorial museum opened in Uwajima in 2003.  Style  His early work was reflective of the monochrome sosaku hanga style. He began to develop his own style in the late 1930s. Azechi became known for his paintings of mountains and the people who live there. He became a regular mountain climber, and became well-known for his writing on the topic.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. It is a two-story two-room deep house with a two-story full-length porch. Its earliest portion, built around 1830, was a frame, two-story, one-room deep side hall and parlor house. It was expanded and modified later, perhaps around 1860 or even as late as around 1880, into its Greek Revival form. There is an \\"Eastlake-inspired projecting second-floor balcony\\" which was added around 1880. It is significant in part for its association with master builder and carpenter John S. Fitch, who built and lived in the house.  John S. Fitch  John S. Fitch a carpenter born in Norwich, Connecticut on October 15, 1792. Fitch was hired by the architect William Nichols to do the carpentry work in the new state capitol to be built in Tuscaloosa, 1827-1831. Fitch is also attributed for designing and building the 1832 Tuscaloosa County Courthouse. John Fitch built his own house several blocks from the state capitol around 1827. The most outstanding feature of the Fitch House is the elliptical stairway supported by an internal system at cantilevered joists. This construction technique is associated with grand stairways found in public buildings of the period, but not in domestic structures. Fitch has successfully scaled down the size of the stairway while retaining the sophistication of the design. The graceful stairway is very different from the heavy and massive architecture of the period so prevalent in Tuscaloosa. The stairway is one of the finest examples of residential stairways in the state. Another unique feature of the Fitch House is the mantel located in the original front west parlor. The turned-spool design is a variation of the popular type of Federal style found in pattern books of the period. The presence of an overmantel is a unique occurrence in Alabama, with only one other known example of an early overmantel in existence.

Col John Lynedoch, his battalion of zombie redcoats from the Indian Rebellion of 1857, and the fictional CIPD force. The series is written and directed by Patrick Graham and co-directed by Nikhil Mahajan. Produced by Blumhouse Productions and Red Chillies Entertainment, the web series stars Vineet Kumar Singh and Aahana Kumra in significant roles. Betaal is released on Netflix, making it the second collaboration between the production house and Netflix.The series received generally mixed reviews, with praise for its innovative and powerful storyline, performances and the use of mythology and zombie, but criticism for its lack of thrill and suspense and editing.  Synopsis  This miniseries generally focuses Commandant Vikram Sirohi (Vineet Kumar Singh) and his teammates: Ahluwalia, Akbar, and Haq (Akbar's cousin, a new recruit), from the \\"Baaz Squad\\", an elite unit of the fictional Counter Insurgency Police Department (CIPD). Commandant Tyagi (Suchitra Pillai), who is in-charge of \\"Baaz Squad\\", privately colludes with the owner of Surya Construction Company, Ajay Mudhalvan (Jitendra Joshi) to relocate or murder Naxalite rebels and Adivasi people from their lands so they can be used for various construction projects overseen by Surya Corp. . She keeps the true motivations of these operations from her squad's knowledge and vehemently denounces media and public figures who attempt to communicate the truth to the public. Vikram follows her blindly to avoid the shame and guilt he feels for his actions. He is particularly haunted by a memory concerning a young girl in the tribal regions of India. The film begins with a large group of Adivasi people conducting a ritual at a shrine to a spirit they call the \\"Betaal\\". An elderly woman who can commune with the spirit touches the statue of the \\"Betaal\\" within their worship hall. It gives her visions, revealing what might happened if the \\"Betaal\\" is allowed to leave the tunnel it has been trapped in since the days of the British East India Company. She warns the community not to allow the tunnel to be opened. Outside of the village, Mudhalvan, his wife, Shakuntala, and his young daughter, Saanvi, are preparing to turn the community and the surrounding area into a construction site. They are rushing to meet deadlines before the CM arrives to inaugurate the project. Mudhalvan has ordered Commandant Tyagi and Baaz Squad to have the area cleared for a highway-building project in a remote village near the Betaal Mountain. When the squad arrives there, the Adivasi villagers are refusing to leave their homes and the area. Baaz Squad forcibly removes the villagers and burns the homes in preparation for the entire community to be razed. The villagers retreat to the entrance of a tunnel, defending it with antique weapons and farm tools. Vikram demands they leave the tunnel entrance so it can be cleared for the development project. When they refuse, Vikram and Baaz Squad hesitate to open fire on the villagers without being fired upon. Mudhalvan's subordinate, Bhunnu, secretly activates a bomb planted near the tunnel entrance, tricking Tyagi and Vikram into believing it is an attack by the villagers. The Baaz Squad kills all but two of the villagers: a woman named Puniya and her husband, Sarpanch. After the tunnel is cleared, some construction workers go inside to begin work when screams start coming from the tunnel and a single disemboweled worker manages to stumble out of the tunnel before dying. Baaz Squad, believing Naxalites are inside, attempt to secure the tunnel but suffer heavy losses and injuries. Tyagi and Haq are among the wounded and must be carried out. A horde of undead British soldiers swarm from the cave, forcing Baaz Squad, Mudhavalan and his family, and the villagers to flee. Puniya and Sarpanch find an old British barracks and lock themselves in. While Baaz Squad and Mudhalvan are forcing their way in, Mudhalvan's wife is killed. Tyagi, whose hair has turned white, begins acting strangely while Haq begins to succumb to his wounds. The team realizes their comms and electronic equipment is malfunctioning, cutting them off from the outside world. As his deceased teammates reanimate, Vikram and the survivors learns from Puniya and records in the old barracks quarters that the undead outside are actually the former 90th Taunton Volunteers regiment under the command of British East India Company Lieutenant Colonel John Lynedoch, who was a respected veteran soldier as well as a noted practitioner of black magic. A bloodthirsty, feared regiment, they followed Lynedoch into the tunnel as he pursued his tyrannical ambition of becoming an emperor of British India. He hoped to find the shrine within and take the powers of the \\"Betaal\\", sealed in the roots of the mountain. However, Indian resistance fighters sealed the entire regiment (and Lynedoch himself) into the tunnel. Lynedoch chose to sacrifice his son, who was a soldier in the very same regiment, to become the \\"Betaal\\". Shortly after, the Colonel devoured his regiment and waited for hundreds of years until he could be released and use his undead army to cover India under his dark banner. The Colonel desires Saanvi as a pure sacrifice to augment his powers and satisfy his hunger. Puniya has used a magic circle of ashes, turmeric, and salt, and a ritual fire to magically defend the barracks from the zombies. However, as the monsoon rains set in, the magical defenses fall before the Colonel and his regiment advances, killing Sarpanch before the survivors can seal the doors of the building. As the group struggles over what to do, Tyagi is revealed to be under the Colonel's possession and Haq becomes a living zombie. The dead soldiers and Shakuntala also come under the Colonel's control. The zombies of the Colonel use their hive mind to assault the barracks. Though Baaz Squad decides to protect Saanvi, Mudhalvan decides to sell her out to the Colonel when Saanvi reveals she knew that the tunnel explosion was a false attack to ensure the project's construction. He allows the zombie army into the barracks, killing Ahluwalia in the process. Vikram is tempted by the Colonel to turn over Saanvi, but manages to lead the survivors out of the fort, destroying many zombies while doing so. They head to the villagers' worship hall to retrieve hidden explosives and destroy the shrine. The Colonel tracks the survivors to the worship hall through Ahluwalia's body before Vikram kills her. Meanwhile, Puniya and Akbar are separated from the group as they try to make contact with a arriving security team from the CM's staff. The arrivals are killed but the two survivors manage to take the CM's vehicle. The Colonel uses Tyagi's body to try to abduct Saanvi but Vikram is able to stop her. However, the Colonel manages to kill Bhunnu and possess Vikram, using his body to drag Saanvi to the sacrificial altar in the mountain tunnel. Mudhalvan is revealed to be caged by the altar in punishment for his failed promise to acquire Saanvi for the Colonel. As Vikram resists the Colonel's mental possession, Lynedoch appears in person and forces Vikram to recount the story of the young girl from his memories. On Tyagi's orders, he shot the girl after massacring her community so she would not be a witness to the unit's crimes. Vikram's desire to atone for this horrible act allows him to briefly escape the Colonel's power and free Saanvi. As the Colonel and the zombies begin to devour Vikram, Saanvi runs and manages to detonate the explosives, destroying the shine. She escapes through the tunnel, where Puniya and Akbar have killed the zombies guarding the tunnel entrance and rescue her. As they drive to safety, they begin to hear widespread reports of attacks from unknown hostiles. Saanvi reads from the book that even if the shrine should be sealed, it should not be destroyed at any cost, as it also acts as a container for the \\"Betaal\\"'s power. If the shrine is broken, the \\"Betaal\\"'s undead curse can spread uncontrollably, with devastating consequences. Akbar turns on a news channel, which shows that Mumbai is under attack from multiple hostiles. The camera focuses on a fleet of 18th-century wooden warships emerging from the fog over the water. They are all revealed to be flying the British flag before the screen cuts to black.

Founded by Karl-Heinz Hoffmann in 1973 the group acted as a private armed force with more than 400 active participants. Regarded as the most active neonazi-terrorist gang in the 1970s and 1980s in the Federal Republic, the group was prohibited by the Interior Minister in 1980. Several members of the Wehrsportgruppe Hoffmann were involved in political murders and antisemitic and far-right violence in the following years. Hoffmann is still active, giving lectures about himself at far-right events and was taking to court journalists, which connected him publicly to the far-right. Foundation Karl-Heinz Hoffmann is a German trained advertising graphic, born in a small town close to N√ºrnberg. He grow up in East-Germany and emigrated to West- Germany in the Adenauer-era, driven by strong anti-communist beliefs. In 1973 he founded the so-called \\"Wehrsportgruppe\\", German for military-sports-group. At this time several nazi-groups disguised their activities under the guise of military-sports groups. Early activities Schloss Ermreuth For almost 10 years, the Wehrsportgruppe Hoffmann was able to organise and set up branches nationwide until its prohibition in 1980. The WSH-members acted as security guards at events of far-right parties NPD- and DVU, attacking protesters violently. Later on members trained with weapons and Nazi military vehicles, wearing uniforms similar to the German Bundeswehr. Hoffmann bought several properties and his girlfriend Franziska Birkmann owned an old castle, Schloss Ermreuth in Bavaria which was planned to be used as a barracks for military exercises. From 1974 his first headquarters was the Schloss Almoshof in N√ºrnberg and from 1978 Schloss Ermreuth bei Neunkirchen am Brand. Impact on neo-Nazi terrorism Hoffmann supported Gundolf K√∂hler and Axel Heinzmann, a far-right CSU-politician in their plans to establish a Wehrsportgruppe at the university city of T√ºbingen in the 1970s. On 4 December 1976, an extremely violent attack by neo-nazis against antifascists demostrators took place at a nazi event in T√ºbingen with the involvement of Hoffmann, Heinzmann and K√∂hler. On September 26, 1980, Gundolf K√∂hler carried out a bombing on the Oktoberfest in Munich, in which 13 people (including himself) were killed and 211 were injured. German authorities regarded this as the action of a single man and Hoffmann involvement was denied by Bavarian officials. On 19 December 1980, the Jewish publisher and Rabbi Shlomo Levin and his partner Frieda Poeschke were murdered in Erlangen by an antisemitic murder-plot. Levin had published critical reports about Wehrsportgruppe Hoffmann. The perpetrator of the attack was a member of the WSG Hoffmann: Uwe Behrendt. Behrendt lived at the HQ of WSG Hoffmann and killed Levin and Poeschke with a 9mm Beretta machine gun. Three hours later he came back to Hoffmann and said: \\"Boss, I shot the chairman of the Jewish community in Erlangen. I did it also for you.\\"https://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-13512120.htmlWolfgang Most: Vereinigung der Einzelt√§ter: Wehrsportgruppe Hoffmann. haGalil, 3. Januar 2006 Hoffmann helped him to cover tracks, burned his clothes and helped him flee to Lebanon.Chef, ich habe den Vorsitzenden erschossen. Spiegel, 47/1984 Influence of the security services WSG Hoffmann came to the attention of several security services in FRG as well in GDR and other European countries. The state security of GDR Stasi supported some far-right terrorists as agent provocateurs. According to the journalist Regine Igel, the Stasi had a number of far-right activists under contract who were members of Wehrsportgruppe Hoffmann.Regine Igel: Terrorismus L√ºgen. Wie die Stasi im Untergrund agierte. Herbig, M√ºnchen 2012, , S. 255. Also the FRG interior intelligence service had several agents and informants in WSG Hoffmann. Reception German politicians in 1980 declared the WSG Hoffmann as a group of \\"mentally retarded\\" and \\"madcaps\\". The Bavarian Minister for the Interior Gerold Tandler (CSU) relativised the group after its prohibition, claiming that left-wing groups were more dangerous because they had more members and were supported by the communists in Moscow. He was more worried that Hoffmann's group would discredit the reputation of West-Germany abroad. Der Spiegel wrote in the 2010s that FRG-officials of CDU and CSU had no deeper interest to uncover the connections of K√∂hler to Hoffmann, because CSU members where also involved in the far-right subculture at this time. Also they wanted to focus more on political violence from the far-left, because this was suited the narrative of conservative politicians during the Cold War.

As a consequence of the initial grounding, the hull was damaged and small quantities of crude oil spilled. The ship's forward part was firmly aground and stuck in mud and silt and the middle section rested on a rock. Heavy winds and the swell of south western monsoon resulted in structural stress on the hull and cracks began to appear on the hull in the subsequent days and the ship began to break up.

During this time, efforts were made to salvage the remaining crude oil on board and a number of smaller tankers including M. T. Endeavor II, SB-408, M.V. Fair Jolly, M. T. Sea Angel and M. T. Umka were used to salvage over half of the stricken ship's crude oil.

History  The regiment spent its first 50 years garrisoning Sapporo, Hokkaido, although the rest of the division was stationed in Asasikawa. However, it also participated in early conflicts in mainland Asia, such as the Russo-Japanese War and the Siberian Intervention. In 1938 it and the rest of the 7th division were assigned to the Kwantung army in Manchuria, and participated in the Nomonhan Incident. It suffered a 91% casualty rate relieving the inexperienced 23rd Infantry Division from the Red Army, which caused it to spend the next three years in Hokkaido again. The regiment then participated in the Guadalcanal Campaign and was near annihilated. It was disbanded on September 2, 1945 under the terms of the Japanese Instrument of Surrender.

The route is a long radial highway running southwest from the southern terminus of the Haneda Route in ≈åta near Haneda International Airport in Tokyo to the Kariba Route in Naka-ku, Yokohama in Kanagawa Prefecture. Alongside the Haneda Route, it connects Tokyo's Inner Circular Route in central Tokyo to Yokohama. Route description Route K1 begins at the interchange at Haneda in ≈åta as a continuation south for the Haneda Route into Kanagawa Prefecture. From this northern terminus, it travels southwest out of Tokyo, crossing in to the eastern part of the city of Kawasaki in Kanagawa Prefecture. The largest junction along the Yokohane Route in Kawasaki is at Daishi Junction where the highway meets the Kawasaki Route at its western terminus. In Yokohama, the expressway intersects the Yokohama North Route, the Daikoku Route, National Route 15, the Mitsuzawa Route, and National Route 1. Route K1 meets its southern terminus at Ishikawach≈ç Junction with the Kariba Route. The speed limit along almost the entire length of the Yokohane Route is set at 60 km/h. The only exception is at the southern terminus of the route between Yokohama-k≈çen and Ishikawach≈ç Junction where the limit is lowered to 50 km/h. History The first section of the Yokohane Route was opened to traffic on 19 July 1968 between the interchanges at Asada and Higashikanagawa. Later that year, on 28 November, the expressway was extended north to its current northern terminus at Haneda. Next it was extended south to Kink≈ç Junction on 7 August 1972. It was extended further to the south terminating at an interchange at Yokohama-k≈çen on 7 March 1978.

The car is the fifth addition in the McLaren Ultimate Series, joining the F1, the P1, Senna, and the Speedtail. The open-top sports car is inspired by the open top racers cars developed by Bruce McLaren in the 1960s.  Nomenclature  The name Elva (pronounced elle va) means \\"she goes!\\" in French. The car is named after the lightweight early open top race cars developed by Bruce McLaren. The M1A, M1B and M1C were produced between 1964 and 1967. Due to limited staff, production was outsourced to British automobile manufacturer Elva.  Specifications  Rear Being the company's first open top road-legal sports car, the Elva is claimed to be the lightest sports car ever produced by McLaren though the actual kerb weight is yet to be announced. The car's entire body work is made of carbon fibre including the chassis, doors and seats in order to keep the weight low. The brake rotors, which are shared with the Senna measure more than . Weight savings of about is achieved over the Senna's brake rotors by the usage of titanium brake calipers. A carbon fibre spar runs the entire length of the interior which supports the arm rest of the seats, a variety of controls and separates the driver and passenger. A six-point racing harness is optional for customers who want to take the car for track day driving. For protection against roll-over crashes, a deployable roll-over protection system is included as standard. The optional audio system has marine-grade speakers for protection against adverse weather conditions. The interior features a severally mounted touch screen to control most of the car's functions. Although the Elva has no windshield or windows, a front windshield will be added for the cars intended for the US market. The McLaren Air Active Management System (AAMS) channels airflow through the car's nose from an inlet in the splitter and directs it at a radius of 130-degrees in front of the occupants (called \\"oasis of calm\\" by McLaren). This system activates at speeds up to where airflow and overall noise are high to create a comfort zone over the occupants. The system can be turned off whilst track driving so that the air channeled through the nose is sent to the engine instead. The Elva also features an active rear spoiler which also acts as an air-brake thus seeing the braking force load with the brakes. A flat undercarriage also helps in improving aerodynamics. The front clamshell is a major part of the aerodynamics package of the car. While its an integral part of the AAMS, it also features two air intakes at the front of each door which directs air to the car's dual intercoolers mounted in front of each rear wheel. The 4.0-litre twin-turbocharged V8 rated at and of torque is shared with the Senna and the Speedtail and is the most powerful variant of McLaren's V8 engine. The engine is fitted with a flat-plane crankshaft, low- mass reciprocating components and a dry-sump lubrication system. The exhaust system is made from titanium and inconel while the exhaust tips are of a quad type and are 3D-printed. The Elva also features a full-time suspension and an electro-hydraulic steering to improve handling. The car will be built to customer specifications by McLaren's MSO department.  Performance and production  The Elva can accelerate to in less than three seconds and in in 6.7 seconds. Production was to be limited to 399 units with customer deliveries scheduled to begin in late 2020. On April 3, 2020, McLaren CEO Mike Flewitt announced the production total would be reduced to 249 units, citing customer feedback encouraging exclusivity as the force behind the decision.

The first Christmas market took place in 1530 in Alt-Berlin.  History  Sale of Christmas baubles at the market on Alexanderplatz (1923) The earliest references to events similar to Christmas markets date back to around 1530 and can be found in the municipal register of C√∂lln.Paul Clauswitz: Das Stadtbuch des alten K√∂ln an der Spree aus dem Jahre 1442. Mit geschichtlicher Einleitung und Erl√§uterungen. hrsgg. vom Verein f√ºr die Geschichte Berlins, Berlin 1921 (Digitalisat). These were first held in the streets between Petriplatz ‚Äì Gertraudenstra√üe ‚Äì K√∂llnischer Fischmarkt ‚Äì M√ºhlendamm ‚Äì Molkenmarkt ‚Äì Poststra√üe and Heiligegeiststra√üe. According to Jutta Schneider, \\"stall holders were explicitly allowed to trade honey cake and other types of syrup based pastries at the Petriplatz and the fish market of C√∂lln in exchange for a stall fee of two Groschen a day during the Christmas season\\".Zitiert nach Jutta Schneider: 11. Dezember 1750: Weihnachtsmarkt in der Breiten Stra√üe. In: Berlinische Monatsschrift, December 1999, S. 75‚Äì77, hier S. 76. In 1750, the city council moved the trading, which originally lasted from 11 December to 6 January, to the Breite Stra√üe. Later on the Christmas market expanded in the direction of the Schlossplatz and remained in the city center until 1873. Since 1872, 27 December has marked the end of the selling season. However, there have been repeated attempts to keep the market off the streets, as it led to significant traffic disruptions in the inner city. Furthermore, Breite Stra√üe store owners feared the Christmas market would compromise their sales, saying the market was \\"a thoroughly obsolete institution for traders, not befitting the conditions and grandeur of the capital of the Reich anymore.\\" In 1873, the Lustgarten (Pleasure Garden) was chosen as the new location, but it was moved to Arkonastra√üe in 1891, with an interruption during World War I, because of safety considerations and the construction of the Berlin Cathedral. Between 1937 and 1945, shortly before the end of World War II, the market returned to the Lustgarten. During its peak there were up to 2000 merchants.Jutta Schneider: 11. Dezember 1750: Weihnachtsmarkt in der Breiten Stra√üe. In: Berlinische Monatsschrift, December 1999, S. 75‚Äì77. During the first peacetime winter in 1945, a Christmas market took place again in the Lustgarten, although it was in the middle of ruins and food and drink were restricted to specific brands.Deutsches Historisches Museum mit einer Passage Weihnachtsm√§rkte gab es weiterhin ‚Ä¶ After 1948, as a result of the division of Berlin into 2 different currency areas, Christmas markets were established in West Berlin with locations at the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church, in Spandau and the Town Hall in Wedding. In East Berlin, the organizers stuck to the old location until 1974. In the years 1952 and 1953, there was a \\"Liliput railway\\" (gauge 381 mm), a forerunner of the pioneer railway Wuhlheide operated by the \\"Young Railway Workers\\" society at the Christmas market around the Lustgarten, the demolished Berlin Palace and the Schlossplatz.Around 1960, the small streets of the Christmas market on the Marx-Engels-Platz were heated by infrared lights. Even after the Palace of the Republic was completed in 1974, the entire Marx-Engels-Platz continued to serve as a venue. Additionally, between 1962 and 1968 they chose a large carpark at Alexanderplatz, an area next to the Sports Hall in the Karl-Marx-Allee was added. Apart from the district of Mitte, there were soon short-term Christmas markets in each of the former districts, mainly around each Town Hall. A Christmas market, which occupied half of the exhibition halls in West Berlin, was held in the exhibition square in West Berlin and took place in 1983. This Christmas market, under Funkturm took place exclusively in the halls and was more like a Christmas and toy exhibition. Other places independent of the weather included: a children's theatre, a hall with cribs from all over the world and another with model trains. The market was abandoned in favour of the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church.Franziska W√ºst: Ein Blick hinter die Kulissen der Berliner Weihnachtsm√§rkte. In: Berliner Morgenpost, 26. November 2013.

He is Professor Emeritus at Sorbonne University and the Institut Pasteur since 2015. He is a member of the French Academy of sciences.  Early life and education  Bernard Dujon grew up as a teenager in the Paris suburban area and went to school at Maisons-Lafitte, where his parents settled in 1958. He became interested in biology very early and at the age of eleven started collecting biological material from his natural environment, plants, fossils, insects, shells, etc. He became in 1965 a laureate of the [./Https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concours%20g%C3%A9n%C3%A9ral Concours G√©n√©ral des Lyc√©es], a nation-wide yearly contest, at the same time he was obtaining his baccalaur√©at. He started a degree of biology at the Facult√© des Sciences de Paris the same year. He graduated in the top 1% of students and was offered the opportunity to compete for an oral exam at the prestigious Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure (ENS rue d'Ulm), was ranked first and admitted there the following year (1966). He therefore became a normalien at the early age of 19, when most of the students attracted by this career are still preparing in specialized schools for this written and oral competition. There, he attended lectures at the Facult√© de Sciences for two years, before choosing Genetics as a specialization during his third year. After a master's degree in Genetics from Pierre and Marie Curie University, Paris (1968), he received a Diploma of Advanced Studies (DEA) in Advanced Genetics (1969). Subsequently, instead of preparing the agr√©gation, that would have ensured a permanent position in the education system, he decided to follow doctorate studies under the supervision of Piotr Slonimski, a Polish-French geneticist, at the CNRS campus of Gif-sur- Yvette, in the southern parisian suburban area. At the same time, he was recruited as a junior scientist by the CNRS (1970), allowing him to complete his PhD thesis, while earning a salary to support his family. He eventually obtained a Doctorate in Natural Sciences, specializing in Genetics, in 1976, from the Pierre and Marie Curie University.  Functions in science and education  He was a trainee, then attach√©, charg√© and research master at the CNRS from 1970 to 1983, then a Professor at the Pierre and Marie Curie University from 1983 to 2015, at the same time part-time assistant professor at the Ecole Polytechnique (1984-1988). From 1989 to 1992 he was Head of Laboratory at the Institut Pasteur, then Professor from 1993 to 2015. He was the head of the Unit√© de G√©n√©tique Mol√©culaire des Levures from 1989 to his retirement in 2015. Among the other functions occupied during his carrier, he has been appointed Scientific Deputy Director General of the Institut Pasteur from 2006 to 2008, by the Director General, Alice Dautry, and from 1997‚Äì2011 he was a Senior member of the Institut Universitaire de France. He is Emeritus Professor at the Institut Pasteur.  Scientific achievements  Bernard Dujon scientific work focuses on the genetic material of eukaryotic organisms, its organization, dynamics, functioning and evolution. Most of his work has used the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as experimental material, but he also got interested in studying other yeasts of biotechnological or medical interest, such as Kluyveromyces lactis and Candida glabrata. = The early years : discovery of the first homing endonuclease = Bernard Dujon (second from the left) and Fran√ßois Jacob (right) attending a Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory meeting in the 1980s. In Gif-sur-Yvette, Bernard Dujon started to study a strange genetic phenomenon, linked to mitochondrial genetics, whose study was still in infancy.B. Dujon et al., ¬´ Mitochondrial Genetics. IX. A model for recombination and segregation of mitochondrial genomes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae ¬ª, Genetics, (1974) 78, p. 415-437 When crossing two haploid yeast species carrying different mitochondrial mutations, conferring the resistance to erythromycin or to chloramphenicol, allele segregation did not follow mendelian rules and recombinants appeared in mysterious proportions. At that time, no one had any idea of the genetic content of mitochondria, except that it contained DNA. Bernard Dujon was studying a particular mitochondrial locus, called omega, that could be present as two different alleles, omega+ or omega-. Genetic crosses between yeast cells carrying different alleles led to highly distorted inheritance in the progeny, since almost all cells ended up carrying the omega+ allele! In 1974, he proposed a model in which gene conversion of the omega- allele to omega+ was achieved by homologous recombination, replacing one allele by the other, copying in the process the flanking erythromycin and chloramphenicol mutations. At about the same time, recombinant DNA technologies and restriction enzymes were discovered. In 1977, independent researches by Fred Sanger on one side and by Walter Gilbert and Allan Maxam on the other, led to the invention of two different methods to sequence DNA. Later the same year, introns were discovered. Thermal denaturation studies with Fran√ßois Michel, another student of Piotr Slonimski, suggested that omega could be an intron. Bernard Dujon contacted Walter Gilbert at Harvard University about the possibility to come to his lab for a short post-doctoral period, in order to sequence the omega locus. He moved to Harvard the following year and in 1979 achieved the sequence of what would become the first mobile intron to be described.B. Dujon, ¬´ Sequence of the intron and flanking exons of the mitochondrial 21S rRNA gene of yeast strains having different alleles at the omega and RIB 1 loci ¬ª, Cell, (1980) 20, p. 185-197 But the most surprising result was not that omega was indeed an intron, but that it contained an open reading frame, putatively encoding a 235 amino acid protein with no homology to any known protein. At that time, no intron was supposed to be coding. Could it be that the encoded protein played a role in the intron mobility between omega- and omega+ strains ?A. Jacquier and B. Dujon, ¬´ An intron encoded protein is active in a gene conversion process that spreads an intron into a mitochondrial gene ¬ª, Cell, (1985) 41, p. 383-394 Back to Gif-sur-Yvette in 1981, Bernard Dujon set up a small team in an old lab space lent by Piotr Slonimski. Fran√ßois Michel rapidly joined him and later on Alain Jacquier, Hugues Blanc, Pierre Dehoux and Laurence Colleaux, as well as sabbatical visitors such as Walt Fangman from the University of Washington. They discovered that the omega intron was present in other yeast species collected in Harvard. Following the sequencing of several other introns, Fran√ßois Michel discovered that these introns could be folded into stem-loops whose structures (if not their sequences) were conserved. This suggested that they could be directly involved in the splicing mechanism by defining exon-intron junctions. In addition, they discovered that two different intronic structures existed, defining what they called group IB. Dujon, ¬´ Group I introns as mobile genetic elements: facts and mechanistic speculations ‚Äì a review ¬ª, Gene, (1989) 82, p. 91-114 and group II introns, a nomenclature still in use today. They published their models of intron folding in Biochimie in 1982 and this article quickly became a reference for researchers in the field. But the precise function of the omega-encoded protein was still unknown. Bernard Dujon decided to adapt the mitochondrial gene to the universal genetic code in order to be able to express it in a heterologous system. At that time, it was a real tour de force, since oligonucleotide synthesis and in vitro mutagenesis were uncommon and not available in Gif-sur-Yvette. Fortunately, Bernard Dujon met Francis Galibert, who was working at the H√¥pital Saint Louis in Paris and who just came back from Fred Sanger laboratory to set up his own lab. At that time, he was the only one in France to be able to synthesize oligonucleotides. With the help of Francis Galibert's oligonucleotides, Bernard Dujon modified 26 of the 235 codons of the omega reading frame to adapt it to the universal genetic code. Synthesis of the resulting protein in Escherichia coli, in the presence of a plasmid carrying the omega-sequence showed without any ambiguity, in 1985, that the omega protein was a double-strand DNA endonuclease, as was predicted by the model 12 years ago.L. Colleaux et al., ¬´ Universal code equivalent of a yeast mitochondrial intron reading frame is expressed into E. coli as a specific double strand endonuclease ¬ª, Cell, (1986) 44, p. 521-533 This nuclease took afterwards the conventional name of I-SceI,L. Colleaux et al., ¬´ Recognition and cleavage site of the intron encoded omega transposase ¬ª, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sc. USA, (1988) 85, p. 6022-6026 the first intron homing endonuclease discovered, first of its kind but dozens of others would rapidly follow. In 1987, a call for a yeast geneticist was published by the Institut Pasteur. Bernard Dujon applied and left Gif-sur-Yvette to move to Paris. In this new scientific environment, he used I-SceI to the purpose of making unique double-strand breaks in complex genomes, such as mouse, plants or the human genome, in collaboration with many scientists worldwide. In collaboration with the laboratory of Jean-Fran√ßois Nicolas at the Institut Pasteur, Arnaud Perrin and Andr√© Choulika (who would later become two founding members of the biotech company Cellectis) were able to do the first gene replacement in mouse cells using I-SceI,A. Choulika et al., ¬´ Induction of homologous recombination in mammalian chromosomes by using the I-Sce I system of Saccharomyces cerevisiae ¬ª, Mol. Cell. Biol, (1995) 15, p. 1968‚Äì1973 at the same time Maria Jasin in United States was doing similar experiments in human cells. = The yeast genome project = The \\"yeast teams\\" of the Institut Pasteur in 1995. Pierre Legrain (second from the right) and Alain Jacquier (not on this picture) set up their own yeast laboratory in 1995, as the first \\"bud\\" of Bernard Dujon (left) laboratory. Several young researchers and students on this picture have since set up their own laboratory. In 1988, Andr√© Goffeau, a Belgian yeast geneticist from the University of Louvain-la- Neuve convinced the European Commission to support the complete sequencing of the yeast genome. Under his management, 30 European laboratories collaborated to this endeavor. Their goal was to sequence 10 kb of DNA in two years of time, in order to complete chromosome III sequence, one of the smallest ones. Later on, they were joined by other labs worldwide to help sequencing the 15 other chromosomes. Bernard Dujon took an active part in this project and was one of the leading figures of the yeast program. He coordinated the sequencing of two chromosomes out of sixteen (XI and XV) and the map of a third chromosome (VII) was made by Herv√© Tettelin, Andr√© Goffeau's student, using the I-SceI chromosome fragmentation technology developed in the meantime. The yeast genome sequence was completed in 1995 and published one year later. During the course of this project, it was discovered that one third of the sequenced genes had no homologue in any database (the so-called \\"orphans\\"). The extremely high level of gene redundancy, due -at least in part- to an ancient whole-genome duplication in the ancestor of Saccharomyces species, led to a new era in biology. Genomics, freshly born as a new science, will be studying entire genomes, instead of individual genes, and try to understand genome organization and evolution. = The G√©nolevures program = Bernard Dujon laboratory at the departemental retreat in Normandy, in 2002. From left to right (standing): Bernard Dujon, Romain Koszul, Ingrid Lafontaine, Martine Rambaud, Stefan Pellenz, Jeanne Boyer, Christophe Hennequin, Emmanuel Talla, Agn√®s Thierry, Odile Ozier-Kalogeropoulos, Fredj Tekaia, Gilles Fischer, C√©cile Fairhead. From left to right (sat): Guy-Franck Richard, Emmanuelle Fabre. While Bernard Dujon was participating to the EUROFAN program, aiming at determining the function of all discovered genes, he started a completely different approach, based on yeast comparative genomics. Odile Ozier- Kalogeropoulos and her Master student, Alain Malpertuy, had produced 600 sequence reads of a yeast of biotechnological interest, Kluyveromyces lactis. This allowed them to identify hundreds of new genes by direct comparison with the S. cerevisiae genome. By analogy with Expressed Sequence Tags (EST) that were widely used at that time as a proxy to estimate the number of different human genes and their expression tissues, Alain Malpertuy coined these sequences Random Sequence Tags (RST) and the acronym was subsequently kept for further similar studies. Following an informal discussion with Jean Weissenbach, head of the G√©noscope, the largest sequencing center in France, Bernard Dujon contacted two French geneticists who were known to be interested in non-conventioal yeast species: Jean-Luc Souciet at the University of Strasbourg and Claude Gaillardin at the National Center for Agronomy (INRA) in Grignon. Together, with several French laboratories sharing similar scientific interests, they decided to sequence to low coverage 13 yeast species representing the various branches of the Saccharomycotina (formerly known as Hemiascomycetes), some of them of biotechnological or medical interest. At the end of the year 1998, the G√©noscope offered 50 000 sequence reads for this project, 40 millions of nucleotides, roughly corresponding to 0.2-0.4 X coverage of each of the 13 genomes. Altogether, 20 000 new genes were discovered and allowed to compare sequence divergence, synteny, gene redundancy and functions among these 13 species and between them and S. cerevisiae. These yeasts revealed at the level of their genomes, large evolutionary distances between them . Their comparison made possible to develop new theories on the molecular mechanisms of evolution of eukaryotic genomes which, thanks to the power of genetics in S. cerevisiae, can be directly subjected to experimentation. Results were published in a special issue of FEBS Letters, edited by Horst Feldman and appeared in press just a few days before the end of the XXth century. Bernard Dujon and one of his PhD students, Stefan Pellenz, at the Institut Pasteur in 2004. Following this project, a landmark for subsequent yeast comparative genomics studies, the CNRS offered to support the French consortium, under the name G√©nolevures (levure being the French word for yeast). Note that the financial support was limited to coordination, but did not cover sequencing nor subsequent data analysis. The G√©nolevures consortium sequenced to completion four yeast genomes, Candida glabrata, Kluyveromyces lactis, Debaryomyces hansenii and Yarrowia lipolytica. Numerous functional and comparative studies were made from these sequences, including genes involved in replication, recombination and repair, mating and meiosis, short and long tandem repeats, tRNA genes, introns, pseudogenes, telomeres and subtelomeres and evolution of the genetic code. These results were published in Nature, as well as in several other scientific journals. = The origin of genes and chromosomal amplifications = Sequencing yeast genomes led to the discovery of many new genes of unknown function, phylogenetically unrelated. This led to the question of their very origin. Bernard Dujon tried to tackle this problem by setting up an experimental system to study the evolution of tRNA genes. During the course of these experiments, he discovered that yeast strains in which an essential amino-acyl-tRNA synthetase had been replaced by its homologue from Yarrowia lipolytica, a distantly related yeast, were severely unfit. However, normal growth revertants appeared in the culture at a high frequency. Whole-genome sequencing of these mutants showed that the chromosomal segment containing the foreign tRNA synthetase had been amplified by a rolling circle mechanism, creating a variety of aberrant chromosomal structures under constant evolution. While looking for tRNA duplication, Bernard Dujon discovered the amplification of its cognate tRNA synthetase, another example of seredipity in science ! = Interspecific hybridizations = Fascinated by interspecific hybridizations that spontaneously occurred frequently in nature, Bernard Dujon last scientific project was to create artificial yeast species resulting from forced hybridization between two known yeast species and to study genome evolution of these new hybrids. This was the PhD project of Lucia Morales, last of the many students trained by Bernard Dujon over the course of his long career. Making these hybrids at the bench proved to me much more challenging than initially expected, suggesting that laboratory conditions may not favor interspecific hybridizations between distant yeast species. = Bernard Dujon legacy = Bernard Dujon (left) and his colleagues (Eric Westhof), wearing the \\"Habit vert\\" of the Institut de France. Bernard Dujon retired in 2015, at the age of 68 and became Emeritus Professor. Over the 26 years during which the Unit√© de G√©n√©tique Mol√©culaire des Levures was operating, more than 120 people have worked there, 250 scientific publications were produced shared with more than 800 colleagues all over the world and 22 PhD thesis and Habilitations √† diriger des recherches were defended.

She is Head of the Developmental Biology Unit and director of the EMBL International Centre for Advanced Training (EICAT) program at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL).  Biography  Anne Ephrussi studied biology at Harvard University in the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology from where she graduated in 1979. She continued to do her PhD at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the group of Dr. Susumu Tonegawa where she received her doctoral degree in 1985.

Personal Details  Anne Ephrussi has the French and the American citizenship. She is the daughter of Boris Ephrussi and Harriet Ephrussi-Taylor . She lives in Heidelberg, is married and has one child.  Research  With her research, Anne Ephrussi has contributed to the elucidation of the crucial role that spatial and temporal control of mRNA localization and translation play in oocyte development and cell polarity. Dr. Ephrussi established that oskar RNA is accumulated at and thereby defines the posterior pole of the Drosophila oocyte. Aberrant localization and translation leads to germ cell formation defects and mispatterning during development. Proper localization of oskar mRNA is ensured by concerted actions of the exon junction complex and oskar's 3‚Äô UTR followed by a microtubule-based movement. During transport, translation of oskar is repressed by the RNA-binding protein Bruno, which is in turn released by the binding of activators (e.g. Orb) upon arrival at the posterior pole. After proper localization, oskar RNA is translated and organizes germ plasm by recruiting other proteins such as Vasa. Her lab's current research continues to focus on spatial and temporal control of translation and which role ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs), cytoskeletal polarization and cytoskeletal motors play in RNA localization. Further, the roles of non-canonical RNA binding proteins in development as well as germ plasm assembly and function are investigated. These questions are tackled using a combination of genetics, biochemistry and a broad spectrum of cell biological and imaging approaches using the large Drosophila melanogaster oocyte as a model.

The possibility for women to have access to university education, and moreover to obtain a university degree is now part of general higher education for all.  Founding stages of universities / Medieval universities  The medieval university as a masculine domain: College on ethics in the 14th century, Laurentius de Voltolina: Liber ethicorum des Henricus de Alemannia (cut sheet, Kupferstichkabinett Berlin) From the 12th century onwards, universities were first founded based on customary law, then after 1350 universities were also established as the territorial lord's endowment. During these initial stages, the social conditions of the Middle Ages led to the establishment of universities as a purely masculine domaine.Bea Lundt: Zur Entstehung der Universit√§t als M√§nnerwelt. In: Elke Kleinau, Claudia Opitz (Hrsg.): Geschichte der M√§dchen- und Frauenbildung. Bd. 1: Vom Mittelalter bis zur Aufkl√§rung. Campus, Frankfurt am Main 1996. S. 103‚Äì118, 484‚Äì488, 550‚Äì551. Many universities emerged from cathedral schools for future priests. Therefore, university lecturers belonged to the clergy and had to live in celibacy (only since 1452 have medical doctors been officially allowed to marry). Additionally, students had to go through a basic clerical education in the Seven Liberal Arts in order to continue their studies; graduating from the Faculty of the Arts included a lower ordination. This way women were implicitly excluded from university studies because, due to the oath of secrecy attributed to Paul's first letter to the Corinthians, they were not allowed to be ordained.Britta-Juliane Kruse: Frauenstudium, medizinisches. 2005, S. 435.Bea Lundt: Zur Entstehung der Universit√§t als M√§nnerwelt. S. 109‚Äì110. The Schola Medica Salernitana, which was founded in 1057 and remained a purely medical college, allowed women to study. Names of female medical doctors of this college have been verified. Trota von Salerno for example, presumably at the beginning of the early 12th century, worked as a practical doctor at the school in Salerno. She wrote several treatises on medical practice in general and on gynecology in particular. One of the works published at the Schola Medica Salernitana in the 12th century includes texts from the school's seven masters (magistri), among which Trota's teachings may be found. In the 13th century a Jewish woman called Rebekka was awarded a doctorate in Salerno as one of the first female doctors ever. Hence, individual schools allowed women to study and teach medicine.Richard Landau: Geschichte der j√ºdischen √Ñrzte. Ein Beitrag zur Geschichte der Medicin.

Abaelardus and H√©lo√Øse in a manuscript of Roman de la Rose (14th century) The beheading of Saint Cathrine of Alexandria (1390) from Lorenzo Monaco The establishment of universities led to the expansion of the importance and function of the sciences as opposed to the trade apprenticeships. Moreover, academics and scientists developed an identity which linked masculinity with mind and spirit. These polarised images of the genders (men = intellectual beings; women = physical beings) were adopted from medieval theology. Thus, science and femininity were seen as a contradiction.Bea Lundt: Zur Entstehung der Universit√§t als M√§nnerwelt. S. 110‚Äì111. Female skills and knowledge were more and more demonised (witches, poisoners). Women, and especially inquisitive women, were seen as distractions from the sciences for the (intellectual) man and often even as a threat to scholars (compare the story of Abelard and H√©lo√Øse as well as Merlin and Viviane).Bea Lundt: Zur Entstehung der Universit√§t als M√§nnerwelt. S. 116‚Äì118. Although, university lecturers and students chose a female scholar as their patron saint, namely Saint Cathrine of Alexandria, according to the legend, Cathrine did not use her knowledge for power or leverage. By rejecting all secular powers, she limited her own options to act.Bea Lundt: Zur Entstehung der Universit√§t als M√§nnerwelt. S. 114‚Äì115. Soon the universities developed men's societies (so-called M√§nnerb√ºnde) with a corresponding subculture (compare for example the songs of the Carmina Burana). The uncontrolled actions of some students often led to conflicts with the city's inhabitants. Sometimes this could lead to the departure of entire groups of academics who then founded new universities elsewhere. Among the universities' intellectuals many rejected the ideas of clerical celibacy as well as marriage. They saw themselves in a competitive situation with the hereditary nobility, which found its expression in showing off their sexual triumphs and sexual assaults against women. In order to protect the citizens' daughters, the cities set up brothels.Bea Lundt: Zur Entstehung der Universit√§t als M√§nnerwelt. S. 111‚Äì113.  Universities in the 16th to 18th century  Until the 18th century noble and bourgeois sons were educated at universities which were still organised in four faculties: the faculty of Arts, Theology, Medicine and Law, for the education of clergymen, doctors and administrative officials, as well as judges and lawyers.Beatrix Niemeyer: Ausschluss oder Ausgrenzung? Frauen im Umkreis der Universit√§ten im 18. Jahrhundert. In: Elke Kleinau, Claudia Opitz (Hrsg.): Geschichte der M√§dchen- und Frauenbildung. Bd. 1: Vom Mittelalter bis zur Aufkl√§rung. Campus, Frankfurt am Main 1996. S. 275‚Äì294, 512‚Äì514, 559; hier S. 276. Universities continued to be spaces of male socialization, although celibacy for professors had been abolished and students were no longer living in accommodation reserved for men. This was the result of education for occupations only available to men. Additionally, since the 16th century students had regarded each other as commilitones (brothers-in-arms) and the culture of duels increased.Beatrix Niemeyer: Ausschluss oder Ausgrenzung? S. 277.Trude Maurer: Einf√ºhrung: Von der Gleichzeitigkeit des Ungleichzeitigen: Das deutsche Frauenstudium im internationalen Kontext. In: Trude Maurer (Hrsg.): Der Weg an die Universit√§t.

Die Gottschedin, oil by Elias Gottlob Hau√ümann (about 1750) Since there were no generally accepted and binding admission requirements, women were not explicitly banned from studying. Due to the fact that there was no profession a woman could practise after graduating from university, they were left with no real motivation to pursue a course of study. Therefore, women only seldom studied at German universities. The few known examples and the circumstances surrounding their studies emphasized the importance of not distracting the male students with their looks. In the seventeenth century Anna Maria van Schurman, for example, participated in lectures at the University of Utrecht, but only from behind a screen on a balcony to protect the male students from seeing her. In the eighteenth century, Luise Adelgunde Victorie Gottsched could only listen to her husband's lectures at the University of Leipzig when hiding behind a half-closed door. In this way, university education was possible for women in individual cases, but the idea of a female professor teaching at German universities was inconceivable.Beatrix Niemeyer: Ausschluss oder Ausgrenzung? S. 280‚Äì283. In the eighteenth century, individual women, in particular the wives and daughters of professors at universities which were open to reform could meet informally with students and professors for an intellectual exchange. For example, many daughters and wives of professors from G√∂ttingen were highly educated compared to other women.Beatrix Niemeyer: Ausschluss oder Ausgrenzung? S. 283‚Äì284. Encouraged by her father, who educated his daughter as an experiment, Dorothea Schl√∂zer received a doctorate from the University of G√∂ttingen in 1787. Later, her father concentrated on marrying her to a socially acceptable man.Beatrix Niemeyer: Ausschluss oder Ausgrenzung? S. 286‚Äì288. Unlike Schl√∂zer, Dorothea Christiane Erxleben used the authorization given to her by the Prussian king Frederick the Great to complete a degree in Medicine. She received her degree on 6th May 1754Gisela Kaiser: √úber die Zulassung von Frauen zum Studium der Medizin am Beispiel der Universit√§t W√ºrzburg. In: W√ºrzburger medizinhistorische Mitteilungen.

These exceptional cases emphasize how in the 18th century completing a course of study and continuing to use the acquired knowledge in their lives only became harder for women. The acquired knowledge was viewed as \\"unwomanly\\" and potentially a threat to their reputation. Academic studies endangereded the women's chances of marriage, but offered no independent professions.Beatrix Niemeyer: Ausschluss oder Ausgrenzung? S. 293‚Äì294.  19th century to the end of World War I  The male character of the German university reached its peak in the 19th century. Firstly, at German universities the typical German fraternity-type student associations called Studentenverbindung (such as Corps and Burschenschaften) had developed. These groups often also practiced academic fencing. Simultaneously, a binary gender concept with a gender specific division of labour had established. An admissions system that developed in the 19th century was a further peculiarity. In order to study at a university, you needed to have passed the Abitur. Educational patents provided legal rights to particular jobs or study programmes, sometimes even a reduction of compulsory military service. Since there were no girls' schools offering the Abitur (the German leaving certificate) there was an additional obstacle to admission to a German university for women. In some countries women were allowed to study in the 19th century. For example, in the US women had been studying at a few colleges since 1833 and in England since 1869. However, there, women only had access to special colleges for women. In France, universities had never really been closed to women. Here, women had been able to obtain academic degrees since the 1860s. Nevertheless, women were not admitted to the Grandes √©coles. These elite educational institutions remained restricted to women well into the 20th century. In these countries, the full access with equal rights to an academic education was granted about the same time as in the German Reich, where women had been granted equal access right away. = The leading role of Switzerland = Marie Heim-V√∂gtlin In the beginning, women in German-speaking countries were only able to pursue academic studies in Switzerland. The first female auditors were admitted at the University of Zurich in 1840, which had been founded only a few years before. After an application for matriculation of a Russian woman had been unsuccessful in 1864, the application for a doctorate in medicine of Russian Nadezhda Suslova (1843-1918) was approved in 1867, and moreover, she was matriculated as a regular student retroactively.Hartmut Gimmler: Der Pflanzenphysiologe Julius von Sachs (1832‚Äì1897) und das Frauenstudium.

Das schweizerische Frauenstudium und seine russischen Pionierinnen. Hier + Jetzt, Baden 2010. S. 27. Marie Heim-V√∂gtlin (1845‚Äì1908) was the first female university student from Switzerland admitted in 1874. She also graduated with a degree in Medicine.Doris Stump: Zugelassen und ausgegrenzt. In: Verein Feministische Wissenschaft Schweiz (Hrsg.): Ebenso neu als k√ºhn. 120 Jahre Frauenstudium an der Universit√§t Z√ºrich. Efef, Z√ºrich 1988. S. 15‚Äì28; hier S. 16. Famous female students from Zurich in the 19th century included, amongst others, the Swiss women Elisabeth Fl√ºhmann, Meta von Salis and Emilie Kempin-Spyri, the Russian Vera Figner and the Germans Emilie Lehmus, Pauline R√ºdin, Franziska Tiburtius, Anita Augspurg, Ricarda Huch and K√§the Schirmacher. There were different reasons for the pioneering role of Switzerland: In general, university education did not carry a lot of social prestige in Switzerland at this time. Universities tried to attract new students, which ensured their funding by providing additional enrolment fees. Every institution could decide on the admission of women individually. Newer universities, such as Zurich, led by example. However, Switzerland's oldest university, Basel, did not admit women until 1890.Trude Maurer: Von der Gleichzeitigkeit des Ungleichzeitigen. S. 14‚Äì15. Following the first admissions, the number of students at the University of Zurich increased significantly. In the summer of 1873, 26%, or 114, of the students were female. Most of the female students (109) during this time were from Russia. However, the number of women decreased dramatically in 1873, after the Russian Tsar had prohibited Russian women from studying in Zurich with a Ukase proclamation. Only nine female students were enrolled in winter 1880/81. After the annulment of the Ukase, the number of Russian female students increased again substantially. In the first decade of the 20th century, mainly foreign women from Russia und Germany were studying in Switzerland, only later did more Swiss women enroll.Regula Schnurrenberger, Marianne M√ºller: Ein √úberblick. In: Verein Feministische Wissenschaft Schweiz (Hrsg.): Ebenso neu als k√ºhn. 120 Jahre Frauenstudium an der Universit√§t Z√ºrich. Efef, Z√ºrich 1988. S. 195‚Äì207; hier S. 197. The dominance of foreign female students was also caused by the fact that, at first, people who were not born in the Canton of Zurich did not need a school leaving certificate for university admission. A \\"Cerificate of Good Conduct\\" sufficed. Only in 1872 was the minimum age for studying raised to 18, and in 1873 a school leaving certificate became obligatory for all students.Gabi Einsele: Kein Vaterland.

Since then, many women who had wanted to study prepared for the matriculation examination half a year or a year in advance, after arriving in Zurich. Only after having passed the exam were they allowed to matriculate. However, many women had attended lectures at the university before. Since 1900 only the Swiss have been allowed to register as auditors.Gabi Einsele: Kein Vaterland. S. 21, 27. Female students harassing/bothering male waiters in a pub, parody of women's higher education at the University of Zurich (Kladderadatsch 1872). Although women were allowed to study at universities in Switzerland, many students and many professors maintained a hostile attitude towards women's higher education. For example, in 1896, the students council refused a request for women to be allowed to vote in university matters.Gabi Einsele: Kein Vaterland. S. 26‚Äì27. =Russian female students= Nadeschda Suslowa On the occasion of Suslowa's enrolment, she wrote home: \\"I am the first, but not the last. Thousands will come after me.\\" She was right. The Russians were the forerunners for women's studies in Switzerland, but also, they dominated in other European countries until 1914. For this reason, the Russian student typified the image of the female student. In response to the defeat in the Crimean War, which revealed Russia's backwardness, there were extensive reforms in the country from 1855 on, when the serfdom of peasants was abolished, among other things. There was a close connection between the abolition of serfdom and women's emancipation in the Russian women's movement. A demand for education and medicine grew from social commitment. From 1859, Russians were allowed to attend the Russian universities and the Medical-Surgical Academy as auditors. However, after restructuring of university's net in 1864, they were denied again. The Russian women then went to study abroad, mainly in Zurich, probably as a result of Suslowa's sensational dissertation. Many Russians who were able to study in Zurich without a high school diploma were poorly prepared for their studies. This discredited women's studies. The lecturers and the local students rejected calling the Russian students \\"Cossack Horses\\" because this nickname was insulting. There was no integration. However, despite these difficult conditions, many Russian women studied, and one fifth of the students who were enrolled by 1873 graduated (some in Switzerland, some in other countries).Monika Bankowski-Z√ºllig: Z√ºrich ‚Äì das russische Mekka. In: Verein Feministische Wissenschaft Schweiz (Hrsg.): Ebenso neu als k√ºhn. 120 Jahre Frauenstudium an der Universit√§t Z√ºrich. Efef, Z√ºrich 1988, S. 127‚Äì128; hier S. 127. Many of the Russian students were politically active and in touch with revolutionary societies in Zurich. In a Ukas (decree) on 4 June 1873 the Russian Tsar banned all Russians from studying in Zurich, officially because of moral excesses, but actually because of the anarchist activities of some students. Sanctions and even a prohibition to work were the punishments in case of violation.Elke Rupp: Der Beginn des Frauenstudiums an der Universit√§t T√ºbingen. 1978, S. 15.Gabi Einsele: Kein Vaterland. 1992, S. 12. Consequently, the number of Russian students in Zurich dropped dramatically. On the one hand, the Russian government felt responsible to offer an alternative to returning students. On the other hand, there was a shortage of doctors in Russia, which was especially noticeable in wartime. For this reason \\"Training courses for qualified midwives\\" were offered at the Medical-Surgical Academy in St. Petersburg from 1872. Despite the name, these courses fulfilled university standards, so only a part of the female students from Zurich had to move to another Swiss university. The majority went to study in St. Petersburg. After 1881, one by one all educational institutions providing women with higher education were closed, as medically educated women were involved in the assassination of the Russian Tsar. As a result, the second wave of Russian students migrated to Western European universities. After the inauguration of Tsar Nikolaus II in 1895, Russian politics changed again with regard to women's studies. But even then there were many reasons for Russians wanting to study at Western European universities, namely because of (1) the limited training capacities in the Tsarist empire, (2) fear of political persecution, and (3) the unpredictability of the study situation in Russia (universities were closed at short notice, for example). In addition, since 1886 the number of Russian female students of the Jewish faith could not exceed 3% in any higher education institution. In 1905, the domestic political conditions after the failed attempt at revolution brought a further boost. The number of Russian medical students in Berlin tripled. The opponents of women's studies in Germany and Switzerland‚Äîprofessors and members of parliament‚Äîargued that the Russian Ukas from 1873 portrayed an image of a politically subversive, morally corrupt Russian woman. As a reaction, the German women's movement created a picture of the German student which was the exact opposite of the image of the Russian student. Thus, in 1887 Mathilde Weber asked the German students to deliberately distinguish themselves in appearance, clothing and behaviour from their Russian classmates and prevent their dominance in the female students' associations. The Swiss and German students also kept at distance from their Russian classmates. The accusation of six Swiss students in 1870 to the University of Zurich's Senate that Russians did not have the appropriate level of education was only the beginning of a long series of such protests at Western European universities. = German Empire =  Pioneers  Dorothea Christiane Erxleben The first woman to ever receive a doctor's degree in Germany was Dorothea Erxleben in 1754. She was taught practical medicine by her father, then the Prussian king ordered the University of Halle to register her for the PhD programme. In January 1754 she handed in her dissertation, called 'Academic paper on curing illnesses: much too fast and pleasant but nonetheless frequently uncertain' (Academische Abhandlung von der gar zu geschwinden und angenehmen, aber deswegen √∂fters unsicheren Heilung der Krankheiten). On May 6 she successfully passed the viva. On 26 March 1817, Marianne Theodore Charlotte von Siebold Heidenreich (1788-1859) was awarded a doctorate in childbirth, writing her paper on pregnancy outside the uterus ‚Äì specifically abdominal pregnancy. (Schwangerschaft au√üerhalb der Geb√§rmutter und √ºber Bauchh√∂hlenschwangerschaft insbesondere) from the University of Giessen. In 1815 her mother Josepha von Siebold, a qualified midwife, had already been awarded in 1815 an honorary doctorate in the same field. In 1827 the French/Swiss author Daniel Jeanne Wyttenbach (1773-1830) was awarded a philosophical honorary doctorate by Marburg University. Other women who also received a PhD in Germany included Katharina Windscheid (philosophy, 1895 in Heidelberg), Elsa Neumann (physics, 1899 in Berlin), Clara Immerwahr (chemistry, 1900 in Breslau), Dorothea Schl√∂zer (philosophy, 1787, without writing a dissertation), Sofja Kowalewskaja (mathematics, 1874), Julija Wsewolodowna Lermontowa (chemistry, 1874), Margaret Maltby (physical chemistry, 1895), all of them in G√∂ttingen.

(Die Akademische Frau. Gutachten herausragender Universit√§tsprofessoren, Frauenlehrer und Schriftsteller √ºber die Bef√§higung der Frau zum wissenschaftlichen Studium und Berufe). Almost half of the 100 opinions were positive. One third, including one from Max Planck, rejected the idea of women studying. Kirchhoff himself mentioned in the preface of his book that he was in favour of universities being accessible to women. Karl Lenz: Entgrenztes Geschlecht. Zu den Grenzen des Konstruktivismus.

(PDF; 1,09 MB) The book contains a chapter with the 'Records from abroad' where the situation in other countries (United States of America, Belgium, Denmark, England, France, Netherlands, Italy, Russia, Switzerland, Turkey, Hungary) is recounted.  Extending admissions at the end of the 19th century  Since the end of the 19th century women have been gradually allowed to enrol at German universities. In 1880, Hope Bridges Adams Lehmann, who had attended classes as a guest auditor in medicine, was the first woman to graduate with a Staatsexamen from a German university. However, her degree from the University of Leipzig was not officially recognised. Subsequently, she obtained a doctorate in Bern. In 1881, she received the British licence to practise medicine in Dublin. The central cause of the women's movement during the time of the German Empire was the improvement of women's education and their access to professions and careers reserved for men. In 1888, the General German Women's Association submitted a petition to the Prussian House of Representatives asking for the admission of women to the studies of medical and academic teaching degrees. In the same year, the German Reformed Women's Association petitioned for the admission of women to all subjects of study, though these initiatives did not achieve any immediate success. However, individual women achieved exceptions. These exceptions opened a back door to the admission of women at universities ‚Äì what started as an exception became the rule. The first step had been the admission of women as guest auditors, which had been permitted in Prussia since 1896.Helene Lange, Gertrud B√§umer: Handbuch der Frauenbewegung. Moeser, Berlin 1901, S. 96 f. This status allowed many women to study. Among them were important figures of the German Empire, such as Helene St√∂cker or Gertrud B√§umer. Some women, for example Gertrud B√§umer in 1904, used the opportunity complete their studies with a doctorate.Angelika Schaser: Helene Lange und Gertrud B√§umer. Eine politische Lebensgemeinschaft. B√∂hlau, K√∂ln 2010, S. 103‚Äì106. Between 1852 and 1920, women were not admitted to the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich anymore. Therefore, in order to receive an education in the Fine Arts, future female artists had to enroll at expensive private schools or at newly founded institutions such as the ladies' academy of the K√ºnstlerinnen Verein (1884-1920) or the Debschitz-Schule (1902-1914). However, the K√∂nigliche Kunstgewerbeschule, founded in 1868, had allowed women to attend classes since 1872 in a faculty reserved for women. The increase in female students after World War I (as for instance at the University of W√ºrzburg) was criticised and debated in the student body because women were deemed \\"useless\\" during times of war. In December 1919, this led to the foundation of the AStA subcommittee for female issues by the student of mathematics Alma Wolffhardt.Alma Wolffhardt: Frauenstudium. In: W√ºrzburger Universit√§tszeitung. Band 1, 1919, S. 110‚Äì113. She tried to dismiss the allegation that women tried to take intellectual advantage of the war.Walter Ziegler: Die Universit√§t W√ºrzburg im Umbruch (1918‚Äì20). In Peter Baumgart (ed.): Vierhundert Jahre Universit√§t W√ºrzburg. Eine Festschrift. Degener & Co. (Gerhard Gessner), Neustadt an der Aisch 1982 (= Quellen und Beitr√§ge zur Geschichte der Universit√§t W√ºrzburg. Band 6), , ; hier: S. 222 f. There began a tenacious fight for admissions to the academy, which finally had success in the winter semester 1920/1921. In total 17 women were allowed to enroll and to study under the same conditions as their male peers.  Role of jewish Women  Most of the female auditors attended the Friedrich Wilhelm University in Berlin. During the first years, there were particularly many Jewish women, especially from the Russian Empire. At the faculty of medicine they even represented the majority of the female students. Many of these women had previously studied in Switzerland and therefore could provide proof of examination at an academic level. One of the arguments to open German universities to women was that Swiss universities had had good experiences with female students. The most famous was Rosa Luxemburg, who had studied economics during the 1890s at the University of Zurich. Other prominent women who studied at Swiss universities included the sisters Hanna and Maria Weizmann, as well as Vera Chazmann, who later on became the wife of Chaim Weizmann.Hartmut Gimmler, S. 417.In addition, the philosopher Anna Tumarkinbecame the first female professor of the University of Bern.Luise Hirsch: Vom Schtetl in den H√∂rsaal: J√ºdische Frauen und Kulturtransfer. Metropol, Berlin 2010.  Baden as the model state  On 28 February 1900, the Grand Duchy of Baden was the first German state to issue a decree which allowed women full access to universities. Since 1895 women had been granted revocable rights to pursue academic studies at the faculty of philosophy at the University of Heidelberg. A decisive role had been played by Johanna Kappes, an auditor at the University of Freiburg, who had filed a petition with the state government. In Freiburg, the state's decree was implemented retroactively for the winter term 1899/1900. In addition to Johanna Kappes, four women were admitted to the University of Freiburg as regular students. In Heidelberg, regular admissions for women were implemented in summer semester 1900.Vor einhundert Jahren Beginn des Frauenstudiums an der Universit√§t Freiburg. Albert-Ludwigs-Universit√§t Freiburg im Breisgau, 23. Februar 2000. Among these women was the Jewish student of medicine and subsequent physician Rahel Straus, who writes about her times as a student in her memoir.Wir lebten in Deutschland. DVA, Stuttgart 1961. Edith Stein, who obtained a doctorate summa cum laude at the University of Freiburg in 1916, was the first German university assistant with Edmund Husserl in philosophy. Although he later said he believed her capable of pursuing a habilitation, he nonetheless obstructed her career ambitions due to \\"basic issues\\". In her habilitation thesis Finite and Infinite Being (Endliches und Ewiges Sein) she had engaged with the works of Husserl and his successor Heidegger.  The situation in W√ºrttemberg  On 16 May 1904, the King of W√ºrttemberg issued a decree that \\"women in the German Empire should be able to apply to the University of T√ºbingen under the same conditions as their male peers\\". From 1 December 1905 this also applied to the Technische Hochschule Stuttgart.  Prussia  In Prussia, women had been admitted as guest auditors since 1896. Yet women had already been able to study in Prussia with a special permit issued by the minister of education. As early as 1895, 40 women were studying in Berlin and 31 in G√∂ttingen. Overall the admission of women as guest auditors had been a significant improvement to their legal status because they were allowed to obtain a doctorate.Helene Lange, Gertrud B√§umer: Handbuch der Frauenbewegung. Moeser, Berlin 1901, S. 98 f. In 1908, women were allowed to enroll as regular students at Prussian universities. In 1913 approximately 8% of all students were women. By 1930 their percentage had increased to 16%.  End of World War I to end of World War II  = Contrasting developments during National Socialism = After taking over the government, the National Socialists announced they would reduce the percentage of women at universities to 10%. This measure was only partly fulfilled and later secretly revised. In the beginning, access was restricted to prevent the overcrowding of German schools and universities but the law was revised in 1935. The number of students decreased dramatically due to the urgent need to expand the German Armed Forces: there were far fewer than the expected 15,000. 10,538 men and 1,503 women registered in 1934, which led to a shortage of young academics although, since 1936 the number of women at German universities had actually been growing. Women's studies were even promoted from 1938 onwards. During WWII the number of female students increased considerably and proportionally, setting new records in 1943; of the 25,000 students 50% were women. This ratio was not realized again until 1995. Even in natural science classes the majority of the students were women. Claudia Huerkamp: Bildungsb√ºrgerinnen. Frauen im Studium und in akademischen Berufen 1900‚Äì1945. Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, 1996. In 1934 Austria introduced a numerus clausus of 10% with various limitations and obstacles to admission, which brought about a major change. Even though the number of female students increased as of 1939 due to the war, only after 1945 were laws regarding equality of students established. Der m√ºhsame Weg der Frauen an die Unis.

Taishan Commandery was created in 122 BC, when the king of Jibei offered the land surrounding Mount Tai to the Han emperor. This region, together with a few counties from Jinan Commandery, formed the basis of Taishan Commandery. In 88 BC, Jibei was abolished, and its territories were merged into Taishan. In late Western Han dynasty, the commandery administered 24 counties: Fenggao (Â•âÈ´ò), Bo (Âçö), Cha (Ëå¨), Lu (Áõß), Feicheng (ËÇ•Êàê), Yiqiu (Ëõá‰∏ò), Gang (Ââõ), Chai (Êü¥), Gai (Ëìã), Liangfu (Ê¢ÅÁà∂), Dongpingyang (Êù±Âπ≥ÈôΩ), Nanwuyang (ÂçóÊ≠¶ÈôΩ), Laiwu (ËêäËï™), Juping (ÈâÖÂπ≥), Ying (Â¨¥), Mu (Áâü), Mengyin (ËíôÈô∞), Hua (ËèØ), Ningyang (ÂØßÈôΩ), Chengqiu (‰πò‰∏ò), Fuyang (ÂØåÈôΩ), Taoshan (Ê°ÉÂ±±), Taoxiang (Ê°ÉÈÑâ), Shi (Âºè). The population in 2 AD was 726,604, in 172,086 households.Book of Han, Chapter 28. Several of the counties were abolished in early Eastern Han. In 90 AD, Jibei Kingdom was reestablished, and 3 counties (Lu, Yiqiu, Gang) was transferred to the new kingdom.

This is unlike with most international sports leagues in which the worst teams are relegated and spend the next season in a lower-tiered league that costs the team lots in revenue as well as making it much more difficult to attract top talent, thus making it infeasible to tank. Tanking teams are usually seeking higher picks in the next draft, since league rules generally give the highest draft picks in reverse order to the previous season's worst teams. Tanking may also be referred to as rebuilding. Teams that decide to start tanking often do so by trading away star players in order to reduce payroll and bring in prospects. Historical examples One of the first teams to \\"tank\\" was the 1983-84 Houston Rockets, who considered the season lost after starting 20-26 and decided to play more bench players in order to fall in the standings and get higher in the draft order for the following season.Tanking in professional sports is not a new phenomenon In the 1983‚Äì84 NHL season, the Pittsburgh Penguins and New Jersey Devils admitted they wanted to lose in order to get the number one pick in the draft and select Mario Lemieux. But tanking did not become prevalent until the 2010s, when teams in all four major American leagues (the MLB, NFL, NBA, and NHL) were engaged in various forms of the practice.No longer sports‚Äô dirty little secret, tanking is on full display and impossible to contain The Chicago Cubs and Houston Astros pioneered the practice in the MLB in the 2010s, finishing last in their respective leagues for several years. Both teams used subsequent draft picks to select star players who led them to championships, as the Cubs won the 2016 World Series and the Astros won in .How pro sports teams get to the top by racing to the bottom Other teams like the Miami Marlins, Baltimore Orioles, Kansas City Royals, and Detroit Tigers have sought to emulate the strategy by trading away top players with the goal of drafting and developing top players and cutting costs in order to become competitive again several years later.Series against Marlins pits major league-worst Orioles vs. team that was accused of trying to tank In 2014, the Australian Football League's Melbourne Football Club were fined $500,000 for their involvement in a 2009 tanking scandal. When Jon Gruden retook control of the Oakland Raiders prior to the 2018 NFL season he liquidated most of the Raiders' talent, most notably trading five-time pro bowler Khalil Mack to the Chicago Bears for two first round draft picks, leading to accusations that he was intentionally tanking the team in hopes of fielding a competitive team when the Raiders move to Las Vegas in 2020.The Soon-To-Be Las Vegas Raiders Can‚Äôt Admit It, But the Team Is TankingJon Gruden: Raiders 'aren't tanking' for top draft pickRaiders' Jon Gruden fires back at critics: 'We aren't tanking anything' The Raiders, who had finished 12-4 and qualified for the playoffs two seasons prior, finished their 2018 season with only four wins, but saw significant improvement the next season thanks to strong play from the team's rookies. The Miami Dolphins were widely accused of tanking during their 2019 season when new head coach Brian Flores oversaw a similar liquidation of the team's established talent.Dolphins' ineptitude a challenge for oddsmakersMedia continue to call for NFL to do something about Miami Dolphins Encouragement by fans As the NFL doesn't have a draft lottery, coverage of some NFL drafts has been dominated by the presence of a highly touted player who is widely expected to be among the first picked, portraying them as a prize for the league's worst team. For example, the 2009 NFL Draft was nicknamed \\"The Matthew Stafford Sweepstakes\\" as University of Georgia quarterback Matthew Stafford was widely expected to be the first player drafted regardless of which team held the first overall pick. Stafford was indeed drafted first overall, by the Detroit Lions, who did not win a single game during the previous season. This has led to public campaigns where fans of poor performing teams actively encourage losing in order to improve the team's draft position when such a player is expected to be in the next draft. The first widely known example of such a campaign was \\"Suck for Luck\\" during the 2011 NFL season, where fans of mediocre teams encouraged losing in hopes of drafting Andrew Luck, who was considered to be the NFL's best quarterback prospect since Peyton Manning in 1998. The campaign was widely criticized by sports writers, who noted that it isn't in the nature of professional athletes to intentionally lose games and that poor performance should bring punishment, not encouragement.Why 'Suck for Luck' or Any Similar Campaign Is an Impossible EndeavorWhy ‚ÄòSuck for Luck‚Äô Sucks Hall of Fame quarterback Dan Marino denounced the campaign when fans of his former team, the Miami Dolphins, began participating heavily in it and the campaign was also denounced by Luck himself, who called it \\"stupid\\".Andrew Luck Not Amused by \\"Suck for Luck\\" Campaigns Around the NFL Nonetheless, a similar \\"Tank for Tua\\" campaign emerged in the 2019 NFL season, with fans of poor performing teams encouraging losing in hopes of drafting University of Alabama quarterback Tua Tagovailoa.SO YOU WANT TO TANK FOR TUA? A HISTORY OF THE #1 OVERALL PICK However, when Tagovailoa suffered a season ending hip injury which put his chances of declaring for the 2020 NFL Draft in question, the campaign then turned to LSU quarterback Joe Burrow and Ohio State University defensive end Chase Young, respectively becoming \\"Bungle for Burrow\\"https://larrybrownsports.com/football/bag-wearing-bengals-fan-bungle- for-burrow/522957 and \\"Choke for Chase\\".What Giants are saying about awkward Chase Young tank race Similar draft coverage and reaction by fans has been seen in the National Hockey League. Normally, players selected in the NHL Entry Draft continue to play in minor leagues (often their team's affiliate in the developmental American Hockey League) before they reach the NHL, if they reach the NHL at all. Thus, when a draft contains a NHL-ready player who could make an immediate impact for their team, they are coveted. Examples of this include the 1984 NHL Entry Draft, with multiple teams seeking entry into the lottery for the chance to draft Mario Lemieux, or the 2005 NHL Entry Draft, which was nicknamed the \\"Sidney Crosby Sweepstakes\\" as it was believed the winner of that year's lottery would immediately draft Sidney Crosby. The 2015 NHL Entry Draft contained two highly-touted prospects, Connor McDavid and Jack Eichel, effectively guaranteeing the last place team would land an elite player, thus fans of mediocre teams encouraged losing throughout the 2014-15 NHL season. This was most prominently seen among Buffalo Sabres fans, who actively cheered for the opposing team at home games while The Buffalo News regularly published the \\"McEichel Derby,\\" which tracked the Sabres' ranking among the league's worst teams. First Niagara Center infamously erupted in cheers when Sam Gagner of the Phoenix Coyotes scored an overtime-winning goal in a late season match, as the low-ranked Coyotes were seen as a major \\"threat\\" to Buffalo landing a top-two pick. The Sabres finished the season with the worst overall record, securing the second-overall pick which they used to draft Eichel. The NHL revised their draft the following season in response, removing the second pick guarantee for the league's worst team and making all 14 teams who miss the playoffs eligible to win a top-three pick through the draft lottery.\\"NHL Draft Order Rules\\",2020/01/16 Fans of the Philadelphia 76ers adopted the mantra \\"Trust the Process\\" when the team was tanking from 2013 to 2016. Disadvantages While tanking can be a successful strategy in eventually building a winning team, it alienates fans in the midst of the rebuilding process as fans are frustrated by losing teams.Tanking by MLB teams isn‚Äôt a strategy. It‚Äôs fan abuse. During the Astros' rebuilding years of 2011-2013 when they lost an average of 108 games per season, attendance was cut in half and one game had a television rating of 0.0. The Sabres have also seen dips in attendance since their alleged rebuilding years in the 2010s and have also been described as a \\"toxic environment\\". Tanking can lead to strife with players' unions as tanking teams choose rookies on inexpensive contracts over free agents wanting multimillion dollar deals.Collusion, Tanking, Debt: Yes, Baseball Has A Dark Labor History, But 2018 Doesn't Feel Like 1985 The NBA and NHL have responded to the phenomenon in recent years by changing their draft from reverse-order to a lottery formula which is only loosely tied to the previous season's standings. Some observers have called for leagues to adopt a European-style relegation system where the worst teams are demoted to a minor league to make tanking less attractive.Should the NBA send the Lakers to the G League?MLB Should Threaten Tanking Teams With Relegation See also * Sunk cost References Category:Sports terminology Category:Baseball strategy Category:Sports science Category:Basketball terminology Category:American football terminology Category:Ice hockey terminology ","title":"Tanking (sports)"},{"id":"62331353","text":"A Hymn of St Columba is a composition for choir and organ by Benjamin Britten, written in 1962. He set a hymn in Latin by Saint Columba, the founder of Iona Abbey, to music. It was published by Boosey & Hawkes.  History  Britten composed A Hymn of St Columba on 29 December 1962. He wrote the work on a commission to commemorate the 1400th anniversary of a voyage by Columba from Ireland to Iona Island, where he founded Iona Abbey, and from where he was a missionary in the Highlands of Scotland. Britten set a hymn attributed to him, in three stanzas of five lines each. The first line, \\"Regis regum rectissimi\\", freely translated to \\"King of kings and of lords most high\\", is also the last line of all three stanzas. The text reflects the day of judgement, similar to the Dies irae sequence, first in anxiety, finally in an outlook for rest after earthly desires will have ended. A Hymn of St Columba is dedicated to Derek Hill who commissioned it. It was published by Boosey & Hawkes. It was premiered outdoors in Churchill, County Donegal, where Columba is said to have preached, but was not easily audible due to the strong wind. The work was recorded several times.  Music  The music of A Hymn of St Columba follows the tradition of Anglican Church music, with added personal features. It is suitable as an introit or an anthem in services such as commemorations of Saint Columba, All Souls' Day and Remembrance Day. The duration is given as two-to-three minutes. The music is scored for a four-part choir and organ. Britten begins, setting the mood of fear for the day of judgement, with an ostinato in the pedal, which recurs throughout the piece, also in the manuals. The voices begin with a unison line, which later reappears at the end as a canon of the high voices and the low voices. In the end, the opening line is sung pianissimo, addressing the \\"King of Kings\\" with \\"hushed awe\\", as Paul Spicer describes.

History and motivation  Certain numbers can be approximated well by certain rationals; specifically, the convergents of the continued fraction are the best approximations by rational numbers having denominators less than a certain bound. For example, the approximation \\\\pi\\\\approx\\\\frac{22}{7} is the best rational approximation among rational numbers with denominator up to 56. Also, some numbers can be approximated more readily than others. Dirichlet proved in 1840 that the least readily approximable numbers are the rational numbers, in the sense that for every irrational number there exists infinitely many rational numbers approximating it to a certain degree of accuracy that only finitely many such rational approximations exist for rational numbers . Specifically, he proved that for any number \\\\alpha there are infinitely many pairs of relatively prime numbers (p,q) such that \\\\left\\\\alpha - \\\\frac{p}{q}\\\\right < \\\\frac{1}{q^2} if and only if \\\\alpha is irrational. 51 years later, Hurwitz further improved Dirichlet's approximation theorem by a factor of , contains the actual proof in German. improving the right-hand side from 1/q^2 to 1/\\\\sqrt{5}q^2 for irrational numbers: : \\\\left\\\\alpha - \\\\frac{p}{q}\\\\right < \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{5}q^2}. The above result is best possible since the golden ratio \\\\phi is irrational but if we replace by any larger number in the above expression then we will only be able to find finitely many rational numbers that satisfy the inequality for \\\\alpha=\\\\phi. Furthermore, he showed that among the irrational numbers, the least readily approximable numbers are those of the form \\\\frac{a\\\\phi+b}{c\\\\phi+d} where \\\\phi is the golden ratio, a,b,c,d\\\\in\\\\Z and ad-bc=\\\\pm1. (These numbers are said to be equivalent to \\\\phi.) If we omit these numbers, just as we omitted the rational numbers in Dirichlet's theorem, then we can increase the number to 2. Again this new bound is best possible in the new setting, but this time the number , and numbers equivalent to it, limits the bound. If we don't allow those numbers then we can again increase the number on the right hand side of the inequality from 2 to /5, for which the numbers equivalent to \\\\frac{1+\\\\sqrt{221}}{10} limits the bound. The numbers generated show how well these numbers can be approximated, this can be seen as a property of the real numbers. However, instead of considering Hurwitz's theorem (and the extensions mentioned above) as a property of the real numbers except certain special numbers, we can consider it as a property of each excluded number. Thus, the theorem can be interpreted as \\"numbers equivalent to \\\\phi, or \\\\frac{1+\\\\sqrt{221}}{10} are among the least readily approximable irrational numbers.\\" This leads us to consider how accurately each number can be approximated by rationals - specifically, by how much can the factor in Dirichlet's approximation theorem be increased to from 1 for that specific number.  Definition  Mathematically, the Markov constant of irrational \\\\alpha is defined as M(\\\\alpha)=\\\\sup \\\\\\\\{\\\\lambda\\\\in\\\\R\\\\left\\\\vert \\\\alpha - \\\\frac{p}{q} \\\\right\\\\vert<\\\\frac{1}{\\\\lambda q^2} \\\\text{ has infinitely many solutions for }p,q\\\\in\\\\N \\\\\\\\}. If the set does not have an upper bound we define M(\\\\alpha)=\\\\infty. Alternatively, it can be defined as \\\\limsup_{k\\\\to\\\\infty}\\\\frac{1}{k^2\\\\left\\\\vert \\\\alpha-\\\\frac{f(k)}{k} \\\\right\\\\vert} where f(k) is defined as the closest integer to \\\\alpha k.  Properties and results  Hurwitz's theorem implies that M(\\\\alpha)\\\\ge\\\\sqrt{5} for all \\\\alpha\\\\in\\\\R. If \\\\alpha = [a_0; a_1, a_2, ...] is its continued fraction expansion then M(\\\\alpha)=\\\\limsup_{k\\\\to\\\\infty}{([a_k; a_{k+1}, a_{k+2}, ...] + [0; a_{k-1}, a_{k-2}, ...,a_1,a_0])}. From the above, if p=\\\\limsup_{k\\\\to\\\\infty}{a_k} then p. This implies that M(\\\\alpha)=\\\\infty if and only if (a_k) is not bounded. In particular, M(\\\\alpha)<\\\\infty if \\\\alpha is a quadratic irrationality. In fact, the lower bound for M(\\\\alpha) can be strengthened to M(\\\\alpha)\\\\ge\\\\sqrt{p^2+4}, the tightest possible. The values of \\\\alpha for which M(\\\\alpha)<3 are families of quadratic irrationalities having the same period (but at different offsets), and the values of M(\\\\alpha) for these \\\\alpha are limited to Lagrange numbers. There are uncountably many numbers for which M(\\\\alpha)=3, no two of which have the same ending; for instance, for each number \\\\alpha = [\\\\underbrace{1;1,...,1}_{r_1},2,2,\\\\underbrace{1;1,...,1}_{r_2},2,2,\\\\underbrace{1;1,...,1}_{r_3},2,2,...] where r_1, M(\\\\alpha)=3. If \\\\beta=\\\\frac{p\\\\alpha+q}{r\\\\alpha+s} where p,q,r,s\\\\in\\\\Z then M(\\\\beta)\\\\ge\\\\frac{M(\\\\alpha)}{\\\\left\\\\vert ps-rq \\\\right\\\\vert}. In particular if \\\\left\\\\vert ps-rq \\\\right\\\\vert=1 them M(\\\\beta)=M(\\\\alpha) . The set L=\\\\\\\\{M(\\\\alpha)\\\\alpha\\\\in\\\\R-\\\\Q\\\\\\\\} forms the Lagrange spectrum. It contains the interval [F,\\\\infty] where F is Freiman's constant. Hence, if m>F\\\\approx4.52783 then there exists irrational \\\\alpha whose Markov constant is m. = Numbers having a Markov constant less than 3 = Burger et al.

He was the founder, general director and chief designer of the Institute of Applied Physics (1966-1996), the founder and president of the Urals-Siberian Branch of Russian Academy of Technological Sciences. He developed air- and navy- launched missiles, custom control and safety systems and computer equipment. He is a Laureate of the USSR State Prize and the holder of the Order of Lenin and the Order of the Red Banner of Labour.  Biography  Vladilen Fyodorovich Minin was born to a family of teachers on 27 May 1932 in the village of Rudinka, Ryazan Oblast. Later the Minin family moved to Nagishy (Lebyazhy Usad) of Gorlovka village settlement in Skopin district of Ryazan Oblast. After his father's return from the Second World War the Minin family moved to Moscow. Vladilen finished secondary school for working youth No. 77 in Stalin district of Moscow, then he studied in industrial school No. 40 to become a metal turner. He worked as a turner at the plant, then as a lab assistant in science classrooms of the school for working youth and taught physics to militiamen. = Alma mater = V.Minin graduated from Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology. His graduate work was devoted to the research of a high-voltage electric discharge in liquid. V.S. Komelkov (one of the chief of the Department of Atomic Energy Institute) who refereed his theses and later offered him the work in his department. = Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences = In 1958, at the invitation of M.A. Lavrentyev, Minin moved to Novosibirsk Academgorodok (scientific centre) to work at Lavrentyev Institute of Hydrodynamics of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences. He initiated some new research directions : electromagnetic throwing of the body, shock waves interaction with bubbles in water with air layers, anomalous properties of nitrogen plasma, explosive sound sources, explosion plume, etc.Minin Vladilen Fyodorovich At that time the research in these fields was not being conducted in any other laboratory of the Institute of Hydrodynamics. In 2005 professor Christopher Earls Brennen published his monograph ¬´Cavitation and Bubble Dynamics¬ª where special focus was given to the research of shock waves interaction with gas bubbles in water and experimental discovery of cumulative jet formation effect in case of bubble collapse conducted by V.F. Minin. V.F.Minin initiated a new direction for the research, i.e. experimental study of solitary wave propagation features in the shallows as applied to tsunami. In 1959 (by the order of Lavrentyev) Minin was appointed the chief engineer to be responsible for the construction and provision of scientific instruments made in his laboratory not only for the Institute of Hydrodynamics, but also for other institutes to- be-built for the Siberian Branch of Russian Academy of Sciences. In 1961 Minin passed his defense for a degree of a candidate of technical sciences. In his theses he offered to apply explosion for low-soluble gas dilution in water. In 1963 Minin was conferred a degree of a senior research assistant in chemical physics of the USSR Academy of Sciences.Decision of the Presidium of the USSR Academy of Sciences, 24 May 1963 In 1963-1964 he started working on branch- oriented optoelectronic systems. V.F. Minin and M.V. Keldysh (President of the USSR Academy of Sciences) testing ‚ÄúTeplo‚Äù At the same period he delivered lectures to his first students at the preliminary courses of Novosibirsk State University. Later he was invited by Vice-rector R.I. Soloukhin to take part in establishing demonstration hall for the Department of General Physics and practical physics. Over 100 demonstration scenarios for a course in physics were made by Minin. In 1959-1969 he worked as an associate professor at the Department of General Physics. = Institute of Applied Physics = In 1966 Minin established a State Special Design Bureau (later renamed into ‚ÄúSosna‚Äù) for radio-electronic solutions. In 1968 the bureau was reorganized into the Institute of Applied Physics and he became the head of it. He was to mobilize various institutes of the Siberian Branch of Russian Academy of Sciences around common work on diversification and branch-oriented fundamental research and pilot works. In 1973 the Institute proceeded with the execution of additional objectives set by the head organization of the Ministry of Machine- Building i.e. development of aircraft-launch rockets. At the same time (the period of preparation for Moscow 1980 Summer Olympic Games) by the government order the Institute was to develop and produce the series of X-ray security systems, explosive detectors (a range of gas analyzers –ú01, –ú02) and explosion-proof facilities and other systems. In the late 1970s ‚Äì the early 1980s joint works with the laboratory of millimeter and submillimeter-wave metrics (Institute of Radio Engineering and Electronics of USSR Academy of Sciences) were started. These were the research works on millimeter and submillimeter wave range for transmission and reflection spectra of the explosives and their simulators. For the first time measurements of their spectral characteristics were determined. Collaborative works directed by V.F. Minin were started to develop high-quality non-aberrational quasi-optical lens of submillimeter-wave range on the basis of theoretical insights and the unique equipment of the Institute of Applied Physics. They were used for producing image visualization systems with regard to weapon detection in a human body as well as for producing a submillimeter microscope. At the same period pioneering investigations were carried out as concerns the effects of anomalous back scattering of dielectric particles and aerospace monitoring of the environment(the 1970s ‚Äì the1980s). For more than 30 years (up to 1996) Minin was a scientific advisor, general director and chief designer of the Institute of Applied Physics. Over 70 types of armaments families were created under the guidance of Minin, in particular, those for the navy (passive decoy projectiles, optoelectronic systems for PK-2 (Russian:), PK-10 (Russian:), PK-16 (Russian:) complexes and others), air force and army of the USSR and Russian Federation (aircraft launch rockets S-8, S-13 family and others). Some of them have no analogues in the world up to now and are used as a basis for further modifications. Minin was also at the head of the research works for developing the techniques and algorithms for numerical simulation of physical and mechanical processes. The research conducted for the development of hardware and software formed the basis for automated computing complexes. Minin was elected a member of the presidium of the regional branch of Siberia and the Far East of the Scientific Council of the USSR Academy of Sciences as regards a complex problem of ‚ÄúMathematical simulation‚Äù and a member of Novosibirsk territorial coordination Council for science, vocational education and policy in science and technology.Resolution of Novosibirsk region administration of 22 June 1994 . ‚Ññ 286 In the field of numerical techniques and algorithmization he was in charge of the research on creating efficient machine-dependent techniques and algorithms for numerical simulation of the mechanics of continua processes. Being in charge of the investigations Minin took part in the works on adaptation of the developed algorithms and creation of the brand new parallel ones for numerical simulation, implemented on the basis of upgraded 128-processor machine PS-2000 as all-in-one decision field. Together with the display stations ‚ÄúGamma‚Äù type it is incorporated in general simulation complex. This system which had no analogues in the USSR made it possible to simulate various significant nonstationary processes of the mechanics of continua. By 1990-91 all the TV centres of the USSR were equipped with video-computer graphic stations GAMMA-T. By means of the developed software-hardware complex the problems of meteoroid protection for spaceship ‚ÄúVega‚Äù (in ‚ÄúVega-Galley‚Äù project) were solved. Pioneering works on cosmogenic safety and Earth protection against asteroids were conducted. In physics of high-speed processes Minin solved the problem of rotating cumulative charges.Minin V.F., Minin I.V, Minin O.V., Technique and equipment for cumulative jet formation without the effect of cumulative charges rotation. Patent R.F. ‚Ññ 2491497, published on 27.08.2013 Bul. ‚Ññ 24 (in Russian). He also presented and gave proof of hypercumulative charges. In the field of cumulative charges in 1969 V.F. Minin received the first empirical results with cylindrical liners. The experiments were conducted at the focal distance equal to the double value of the charge diameter for different masses of explosive charges. Soon afterwards the author's certificate for invention No. 64442 with priority was obtained of 18 June 1970. The obtained knowledge was applied for making cumulative tandem tank projectile for 2A46. It passed complete cycle of governmental and manufacturer's tests with positive results. Under Minin's guidance the works were conducted on the investigation and production of rotating hollow charge shells with a record depth of penetration.Materials of exhibition IDEX-94, Jane‚Äôs Ammunition Handbook, Ninth Edition, 2000-2001, 1995-96 issue of Jane‚Äôs Armour and Artillery Upgrades It was Minin who discovered a new previously unknown field of cumulation, i.e. hypercumulation in which a number of problems have been solved or nearly solved.Minin V.F Minin I.V, Minin O.V., Techniques and devices (variants) for forming high-speed cumulative jets for borehole perforation with deep slug- free channels and large diameter: Patent R.F. ‚Ññ 2412338, publ. 20.02.2011.

Itala film affiche 1918 Il Giardino della Volutta Silent era It was founded during the silent era. In 1905, industrialists Carlo Rossi and William Remmert established a company in Turin, recruiting filmmakers from Path√©. Two years later, they were joined by Giovanni Pastrone who reorganised the company as Itala.Moliterno p.165 Over the next decade, the company enjoyed enormous growth, aided by signing up Path√©'s most popular comedian Andr√© Deed. Further development came with the company's production of historical epic films beginning with The Fall of Troy, allowing the company to open a New York office to sell the films in the American market. This policy was crowned with the success of Pastrone's 1914 epic Cabiria set in Ancient Rome.Moliterno p.165-166 The company continued to make epics along with literary adaptations while Maciste, the most popular character in Cabiria, appeared in further films. However by 1918, Pastrone had lost control of Itala, and the following year the company was absorbed into the conglomerate Unione Cinematografica Italiana which itself collapsed after only a few years. In 1926, the former Turin studios of Itala, now derelict, were acquired as part of the growing film empire of Stefano Pittaluga who already owned the Fert Studios in the city.Moliterno p.166 Relaunch In the early 1930s, Itala Film was relaunched as a Berlin-based company by the producer Alberto Giacalone. The company specialised in co-productions, or Italian versions of German films. In 1937, Giacalone relocated to Rome, with the firm continuing to operate until 1955.

Hong Gyewol jeon is unique for its gender consciousness, in that it is structured as a kind of ‚Äúbattle of the sexes‚Äù between the female and male protagonists to ultimately emphasize the superiority of women. Moreover, the work distinguishes itself through the ways in which the female protagonist demonstrates an androgyny that harmoniously embodies both masculine and feminine qualities.  Authorship  The author and original publication period are both unknown, but the author is considered to be a woman and it is estimated to have been written sometime within the 19th century.  Plot  During the reign of China‚Äôs Ming Dynasty, there is a man named Hong Mu from a noble and renowned family. At a late age, he and his wife finally have a child: a daughter, named Hong Gyewol. One day, Hong Mu hears a prophecy that when Gyewol turns five years old, she will be separated from her parents, only to be reunited when she is eighteen. Just in case, Hong Mu dresses Gyewol in boy‚Äôs clothing and makes sure she receives an education to prepare for the prophecy‚Äôs possible realization. When Gyewol is five years old, a revolt breaks out in the land. Her father is caught in the ensuing chaos and disappears. As a result, Madame Yang, his wife and Gyewol‚Äôs mother, takes Gyewol and tries to escape, but they run into a group of bandits. Madame Yang is kidnapped and the bandits throw Gyewol into a river. Although Madame Yang manages to later escape, she is unable to find Gyewol. By chance, Gyewol is saved by a person named Master Yeo, who treats Gyewol like a boy and sends her to study with Taoist Master Kwak along with his own son, Boguk. Meanwhile, her father, Hong Mu, is captured and held hostage by the traitorous rebels, but is later deemed as having participated in treason and is banished to an island. Madame Yang hears the news about her husband‚Äôs exile and proceeds to track him down, afterwards living together with him on the island. Through her studies, Gyewol learns various military strategies and tactics, and Master Kwak believes that Gyewol will one day conquer the whole world, causing him to bestow her with the name ‚ÄúPyeongguk.‚Äù Over the course of their education, Gyewol manages to prove herself superior in skill and talent, in every way, to Boguk. Master Kwak instructs the two of them to take the civil service examination, with Gyewol passing as first place and Boguk passing as second. When another rebellion breaks out, Gyewol is appointed as general and Boguk is appointed as her adjutant. While Gyewol defeats the enemies deftly and easily, Boguk is surrounded by the enemy forces and needs to be rescued by Gyewol. The rebels escape and head towards the island where Gyewol‚Äôs parents reside. Gyewol pursues them and manages to round up all the enemies and soundly defeat them when, in a dramatic fashion, she is suddenly reunited with her parents. Afterwards, the king rewards Gyewol and Boguk by appointing Gyewol as a feudal lord and Boguk as a minister, a rank lower. He also provides public positions to Gyewol‚Äôs parents, as well as Master Yeo and his wife for raising and looking after Gyewol. All of a sudden, Gyewol becomes ill and the king sends the royal physician, Taeui, to diagnose and treat her, upon which the doctor discovers that she is, in fact, a woman. Knowing that her identity has been discovered, Gyewol changes into women‚Äôs clothes and sends an appeal to the king, informing him of her true identity as a woman. But even though the king knows that Gyewol is a woman, he still lets her maintain her public position. The king arranges for Gyewol to marry Boguk, but right before their nuptials, Gyewol convenes the army and shows Boguk her skills as a warrior. After they are married, Boguk‚Äôs concubine, Yeongchun, acts arrogantly and impudently towards Gyewol. Angered by this behavior, Gyewol orders that she be sentenced to death. Through this incident, Gyewol and Boguk‚Äôs relationship worsens. Soon after, another rebellion breaks out and under the king‚Äôs orders, Gyewol once more dresses as a man and becomes the commander-in-chief. Under Gyewol‚Äôs command, Boguk also comes along to suppress the rebellion. In the battlefield, Boguk is surrounded by the rebels and Gyewol saves him again. The rebels secretly enter the capital city and surround the king, but Gyewol courageously saves him. Gyewol again rounds up and defeats the enemy forces. Afterwards, Gyewol maintains her public position and title and lives in peace and harmony with Boguk, giving birth to three sons and one daughter.  Features and Significance  Hong Gyewol jeon is a work of female hero fiction that narrates the role of the female protagonist and her importance, boldly and vividly portraying the conflict between a superior woman and an inferior man. By emphasizing the woman‚Äôs outstanding skill and superiority through a narrative structured around the antagonism between a man and a woman, the novel demonstrates the problems in a reality where women are subordinated within a patriarchal society that has rigid gender roles and prejudices regarding gender. In this manner, the story illuminates the fluidity of the boundaries demarcating gender and gender roles. Moreover, Hong Gyewol jeon shows how a character that is biologically female passes through both male and female gender roles, as shaped by sociocultural demands. The work traces the trajectory of her life as she moves through gender identities according to the situation, ultimately finding a kind of proper harmony between the two genders. The formulation of this kind of gender duality is shaped through the mutually complementary relations between Hong Gyewol and the male characters that embody the patriarchy. The king, after discovering Hong Gyewol‚Äôs true identity, still acknowledges her skill and allows her to retain her public position, and even after she is married, helps her demonstrate her ‚Äúmasculine‚Äù skills in various situations. Moreover, after Hong Gyewol is married, her father-in-law continues to advocate for her whenever she establishes her superiority over her husband and his son, Boguk. Through the support of such characters that are firmly a part of the patriarchal system, Hong Gyewol changes her original decision in denying a ‚Äúfeminine‚Äù life, and comes to materialize a life where both feminine and masculine qualities are combined. These unique characteristics of Hong Gyewol jeon are often interpreted as the transgression of gender norms and boundaries, causing reviewers to deem it as a work that demonstrates a high degree of female consciousness, especially for its time.  Other  Hong Gyewol jeon is the first work of female hero fiction to be published in textbooks through the revision resulting in the 7th Educational Curriculum (1997-2007). Since then, it has continuously been published in official school textbooks.  Bibliographic Information  All versions of Hong Gyewol jeon are written in hangeul, the Korean alphabet, and copies were circulated as handwritten manuscripts or manuscripts printed with movable lead type. There are currently a total of 16 extant copies. They are generally classified into two categories: the version held at the Academy of Korean Studies collection that comprises of 45 chapters and contains two war stories [hereafter Academy of Korean Studies Version] and the version held at the Dankook University collection that comprises of 103 chapters and contains four war stories [hereafter Dankook University Version]. Both versions have in common that in the first and second tellings of the war stories, the female protagonist demonstrates superior abilities than the male protagonist. However, in contrast to the first and second, the third and fourth war story episodes contain stories that emphasize and strengthen the male protagonists‚Äô agency and role. In this manner, the Academy of Korean Studies Version places a greater importance on the female protagonist in terms of the male-female narrative, while the Dankook University Version increases the importance of the male protagonist and moderates the female protagonist‚Äôs role and importance.

He went on to become a prolific jingle writer, first beginning around 1938 in radio with his chief collaborator, Alan Kent, then, beginning around 1947, in television. Croom-Johnson and Kent are widely credited for being the fathers of the modern short jingle.  Career  Austen Herbert Croom-Johnson ‚Äì nicknamed \\"Bunny\\" and \\"Ginger\\" Croom-Johnson ‚Äì was born in Hereford. His double surname, \\"Croom-Johnson,\\" are the surnames of his paternal great- grandparents, Henry Johnson (c. 1795‚Äì18??) and Catherine Croom (c. 1795‚Äì1876). Austen moved to New York City in 1935. Before moving to New York City, he had worked for the British Broadcasting Company for many years as a producer and performer. One of the programs he created for the BBC, Soft Lights and Music, became very popular. While in England, he wrote themes for Billy Mayerl's \\"Green Tulips\\" and \\"Bats in the Belfry.\\" Croom-Johnson was enthusiastic about jazz, and in particular, English composer Frederick Delius (1862‚Äì1934). In commercial music, Croom-Johnson imported the tune, \\"D'ye ken John Peel?,\\" and scored it for a 1939 jingle, \\"Pepsi-Cola Hits the Spot\\" (aka \\"Nickel, Nickel\\"). His Chicago-born lyricist partner, Alan Bradley Kent (n√© Karl Dewitt Byington, Jr.; 1912‚Äì1991), wrote the words. Its first and most enduring recording was performed ‚Äì jazz-swing style, uptempo ‚Äì by the Tune Twisters, a male vocal jazz trio that, for the prior 5 years, had been enjoying popularity on non-jazz oriented broadcasts from New York City. Lord & Thomas, a bygone New York City advertising agency, had commissioned songwriters Johnson and Kent to develop the campaign; and Newell-Emmett, another bygone New York City advertising agency, managed it for Pepsi-Cola. The jingle is the first in several respects. It is the first to become a hit, as popular music, on network radio, coast to coast ‚Äì owed in part to the catchiness of the tune. It proved so popular that, in some cases, radio stations played it as entertainment rather than as advertising. It also is the first jingle with a short run-time, an innovation that changed broadcast advertising. In an era when advertisements ran often 5 minutes and employed annoyance factors, \\"Pepsi-Cola Hits the Spot\\" was the first to run slightly under 15 seconds, which permitted many more repetitions. The jingle, in 1999, was ranked by AdAge's \\"Top 100 Advertising Campaigns\\" as the No. 1 jingle of the 1940s and No. 14 of all time.

Uganda sells cement, sugar, electricity, steel, cereals and beverages to DRC. DRC, in exchange sells timber, kitenge, palm oil cosmetics and gold to Uganda. Upgrades and reconstruction Before 2019, the road was gravel surfaced, in various stages of disrepair. In November 2019, Yoweri Museveni of Uganda and F√©lix Tshisekedi of the Democratic Republic of the Congo signed agreements in Entebbe, Uganda, to upgrade this road to bituminous surface, within twenty-four months, after the relevant ministers have agreed on implementation details.

The story recounts the life of Choe Chiwon who was suspected of being the child of a golden pig when he was born and thus abandoned. However, he later become the envoy of the Unified Silla empire and was dispatched to China where he was active for a period of time. According to the story, when he finally returned to the Silla empire, he went to Gayasan Mountain and disappeared without a trace. Choe Goun jeon is also referred to as Choe Chung jeon, Choe Munheon jeon, Choe Munchang jeon, and Choe Chiwon jeon. ‚ÄúChoe Chung‚Äù is the name of Choe Chiwon‚Äôs father in these works, while ‚ÄúMunchang‚Äù is one of Choe Chiwon‚Äôs pen names. ‚ÄúMunheon‚Äù is a name bestowed upon him in order to extol his scholarly contributions and good deeds.  Authorship  The author is unknown. The date of creation is estimated to be sometime before the mid-sixteenth century. This is because in Go Sangan (È´òÂ∞ôÈ°î, 1553-1623)‚Äôs Hyobin japgi (ÊïàÈ°∞ÈõúË®ò Literary Miscellany by Hyobin), there is a record of a person having read Choe Munchang jeon (Â¥îÊñáÊòåÂÇ≥ The Tale of Choe Chiwon). There is also a record that indicates that Go Sangan, then in his mid-twenties, read Choe Chiwon‚Äôs fable of the golden pig as noted in Choe Goun jeon and thought ‚ÄúSo such things are possible!‚Äù  Plot  When Choe Chung is appointed as a suryeong (head of the provincial office) at Munchang, his wife is kidnapped by a golden pig. The golden pig has a weakness: he can be killed by sticking a deer skin to the back of his head. Choe Chung‚Äôs wife cunningly discovers the golden pig‚Äôs weakness and thereby kills him. Choe Chung then rescues his wife and they return to their home. Shortly afterwards, his wife gives birth to a son, but Choe Chung suspects that the child was fathered by the golden pig and throws him away at the seaside. There, the child learns how to read by himself and becomes well-versed in writing. One night, the Emperor of China hears the sounds of someone reciting a text. Searching for the source of the sound, the Emperor discovers that it is coming from Silla. The Emperor then selects two of the most accomplished scholars in China and sends them to Silla to appraise the people‚Äôs skill. The scholars take a boat and arrive at the seashore where they meet a child (Choe Chiwon). After seeing the child‚Äôs skill at reading and writing and realizing their own skills do not even measure up to a mere child‚Äôs, the scholars do not dare to explore the rest of Silla and they return to China. Discovering that Silla is filled with numerous talented and capable people, the Emperor decides to invade Silla. He then orders an egg to be wrapped in cotton and placed in a chest made out of stone, securely sealing it up. He then sends the chest to Silla along with a letter that states that if they cannot correctly guess what is inside the chest, he will attack Silla. The Silla King gathers all the scholars in the land and agonizes over what to do. At the time, the Silla Premier, Naeop, had a daughter who was the most beautiful, talented, and virtuous in all the land. Choe Chiwon pretends that he is a mirror repairman and goes to the Silla Premier‚Äôs home. At his home, Choe Chiwon purposefully breaks a mirror and says that he will compensate him by becoming his servant. Choe Chiwon takes good care of the horses and tends the gardens so excellently that people start regarding him strangely. Meanwhile, the Silla King gives a strict order to Premier Naeop to solve the secret of the stone chest. While everyone in the household is filled with worry, Choe Chiwon tells the premier that if he can marry his daughter, he will reveal the secret of the chest. With no other way, the premier marries his daughter to Choe Chiwon. Choe Chiwon correctly guesses the object inside the chest, and the Chinese Emperor demands that they send the person that correctly answered to China. Choe Chiwon is made into an envoy of Silla and is dispatched to China. On the way, Choe Chiwon meets Imok, a monster serpent that is the son of the Dragon King, and receives his help; in Zhejiang, he meets an old woman and receives a cotton cloth soaked in soy sauce; by a riverbank, he receives a magical talisman from a beautiful woman. The Chinese Emperor and his vassals use copious trickery and schemes to try and harm Choe Chiwon, but Choe uses the talisman and escapes the dangerous situation through his literary genius and supernatural forces. A few years later, Hwangso‚Äôs Rebellion breaks out but Choe Chiwon singlehandedly quells the rebellion with a one-page manifesto. The Emperor is extremely happy and bestows Choe Chiwon with many honors, but his other vassals become jealous and slander Choe Chiwon. As a result, Choe Chiwon is banished to an island in the south. There, Choe Chiwon sucks on the soy sauce-soaked cloth he previously received and manages to stave off death. Contrary to all expectations, Choe Chiwon does not die and the Emperor summons Choe Chiwon and rebukes him. However, Choe Chiwon invokes the Taoist magic imbued in a work of his writing and finally, the Chinese Emperor bows his head and apologizes. Choe Chiwon then returns to Silla. Afterwards, Choe Chiwon is banished under the pretext that he made a mistake during the Silla King‚Äôs honored visit. Finally, Choe Chiwon takes his family to Gayasan Mountain and isolates himself from the rest of the world, never to be heard from again.  Features and Significance  Choe Goun jeon consists of numerous fables involving Choe Chiwon and thus, the interpretation of the work is quite particular. Research on Choe Goun jeon can largely be classified into the following three categories: first, research that interprets Choe Goun jeon as expressing growing anti-China sentiment among Koreans and containing a nationalist consciousness; second, as a work that demonstrates a society that reveres talent and merit; third, that Choe Goun jeon demonstrates a critical consciousness towards anti-China sentiment founded upon the Joseon ideology of haedong doga and Joseon‚Äôs ruling power. In the Gubi munhak daegye (Íµ¨ÎπÑÎ¨∏ÌïôÎåÄÍ≥Ñ Complete Works of Korean Oral Literature), after surveying all the fables that refer to Choe Chiwon that have been transmitted to this day, the majority of them refer to Choe Chiwon as the son of a ‚Äúgolden pig.‚Äù In the last part of Choe Goun jeon, Choe Chiwon throws a talisman marked with the Chinese character for ‚Äúpig‚Äù (Áå™) and returns to Silla. (In some versions of the text, he rides a blue lion and returns home). Although some versions of the story include an episode where Choe Chiwon himself declares that he is not the son of a golden pig, there is a possibility that this was a later modification in the novel in consideration of maintaining the story‚Äôs rationality. Moreover, the scenes where China sets up tests for Joseon can be interpreted as scenes that demonstrate China‚Äôs sense of competitiveness with regard to Joseon. Similar stories to Choe Goun jeon include ‚ÄúThe Child That Defeated the Chinese Emperor‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Old Man That Astonished Li Rusong.‚Äù  Archival Materials  There are a total of 31 extant copies of Choe Goun jeon kept in various universities and research centers. There are 15 handwritten copies in classical Chinese, 8 handwritten copies in Korean, and 8 printed copies in Korean.

The protest was sparked by the government's introduction of the controversial Fugitive Offenders amendment bill, which was set to go through second reading on 12 June despite mass opposition. 40,000 protesters gathered outside the Government Headquarters attempted and successfully stalled the second reading of the bill, though the Police deployed numerous canisters of tear gas, rubber bullets and bean bag rounds to disperse the protesters. The government and the police characterised the protest as a \\"riot\\", though they later partially retracted the claim and said that only five of the arrestees rioted. The police were widely criticised for its excessive use of force and arrests of protesters inside hospitals. In particular, the kettling of protesters inside CITIC Tower, was widely condemned. The conflict was the most serious and intense conflict between the police and the protesters during the early stage of the 2019‚Äì20 Hong Kong protests. Protesters began to lay down their five core demands, including the establishment of an independent commission of inquiry into police conduct and use of force and the release and exoneration of arrested protesters. Subsequent protests saw protesters and the police clashing with each other as the number of allegations of Police misconduct continued to increase. Background The protest was sparked by the introduction of the Fugitive Offenders amendment bill by the Hong Kong government. The bill, if enacted, would have allowed the Hong Kong government to extradite criminal fugitives who are wanted in territories to areas including Taiwan and mainland China. This created concerns that the bill would subject Hong Kong residents and visitors to the mainland Chinese jurisdiction and legal system, undermining the region's autonomy and its civil liberties. On 9 June 2019, an estimated 1 million protesters marched on the streets of Hong Kong Island to demand the government to withdraw the controversial extradition bill. The march escalated into intense conflicts between the police and the protesters. Chief Executive Carrie Lam announced on the next day that she acknowledged the march protest and understood that were \\"clearly still concerns\\" among citizens of Hong Kong over the bill. However, she affirmed that the bill would be passed to the Legislative Council for its second reading on 12 June, despite mass opposition. In response, activists began to call for a general strike and mobilise members from the public to protest outside the Government Headquarters to stall the bill from passing its second reading. Timeline =Early stage= A Facebook post calling on people to \\"enjoy a picnic\\" at Tamar Park on 11 June attracted 2,000 people. In anticipation of the protest the next day, the police force tightened the security. Inside Admiralty station, about 50 to 60 police officers stopped commuters, mostly teenagers and searched their bags. Pan-democrats arrived to assist the teens and questioned the police's lack of justification for the search, and about 300 passers-by gathered near the site of conflicts, many of them shouted to condemn the police's decision. The police left the station at 9:05 pm. =General strike and occupation= Online groups called on people to \\"picnic\\" on the morning of 12 June at Tamar Park. A general strike had been called for 12 June, the day of the planned resumption of the second reading of the extradition bill. The Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions (HKCTU) appealed to workers to join the protest; hundreds of businesses closed for the day and numerous workers went on strike. Affiliate Hong Kong Cabin Crew Federation also called a strike. HSBC, Standard Chartered and Bank of East Asia closed some central branches; some of the banks and the Big Four accounting firms had agreed to flexible work arrangements for staff; Hong Kong Jockey Club shut down three of its central betting branches, citing employee safety. The Hong Kong Professional Teachers' Union (HKPTU) called on its members to attend a protest rally after school hours on that day. Student unions of most of the major higher education institutions had also called for student strike on 12 June; 50 social welfare and religious groups also took part in the strike. The Catholic Diocese of Hong Kong urged the Hong Kong government and the public to show restraint, and the administration \\"not to rush to amend the extradition bill before fully responding to the concerns of the legal sector and the public.\\" Another call to \\"picnic\\" at Tamar Park on 12 June attracted close to 10,000 responses. The Legislative Council Commission issued an amber security alert. The protest zone outside the building was closed and access to the complex was limited. Sit-ins began in the morning and a large crowd built up at the MTR exit. In the early morning hours, the crowd rushed onto Harcourt Road and Lung Wo Road, blocking these streets in scenes reminiscent of the 2014 Umbrella Movement protests. A banner with \\"Majority calls on Carrie Lam to step down\\" and \\"Withdraw the extradition bill, defend One Country Two Systems\\" written on it was hung from the Admiralty Centre footbridge. Around 11 am, the Legislative Council Secretariat announced that the second reading debate on the extradition bill had been postponed indefinitely. =Violent clashes= Police vans carrying riot police began to line up adjacent to the Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts and the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre on standby, around 1 pm. A source in the pro-Beijing camp said that some pro-Beijing legislators were at Central Police District Headquarters, while online groups called on protesters to block vehicles that might be used to transport the legislators to the Legislative Council. Protesters occupied Harcourt Road. Around 3:20 pm, protesters on Tim Wa Avenue began to charge the police barricades and were doused with pepper spray in reply. Some protesters at the junction of Lung Wo Road and Tim Wa Avenue broke through the barricades and took over Tim Wa Avenue after riot police walked into the government headquarters, leaving a Special Tactical Unit to defend. Protesters also attempted to charge the Legislative Council building. Riot police dispersed the protesters by firing tear gas, beanbag rounds and rubber bullets. There was a stand-off on Harcourt Road between protesters and the police. Many protesters took shelter in the buildings nearby as more tear gas was fired. As of 6 pm, 22 injured people had been sent to public hospitals. At around 6:20 pm, the Legislative Council Secretariat issued a circular saying Legislative Council President Andrew Leung had called off the meeting. Protesters remained in the streets outside the AIA Tower in Central, Queensway outside Pacific Place shopping mall, and at the junction of Arsenal Street and Hennessy Road in Wan Chai into the night. In Central, private cars were employed to block Connaught Road Central while protesters chanted slogans from the Exchange Square bridge. Protesters defied sustained efforts by police to disperse them after nightfall. By the end of the day, at least 79 protesters and police officers had been treated in hospitals; around 150 tear gas canisters, \\"several\\" rounds of rubber bullets, and 20 beanbag shots had been fired during the protest clearance. Overnight, 2,000 protesters from religious groups held a vigil outside the government headquarters, singing hymns and praying. Various trade unions, businesses and schools also vowed to stage protests. The Hong Kong Professional Teachers' Union called for a city-wide strike lasting a week. At least 4,000 Hong Kong teachers followed the call. =Siege of CITIC Tower= CITIC Tower from Lung Wui Road. According to the CHRF, the police had earlier agreed to peaceful demonstration within the area outside CITIC Tower in its letter of no objection. However, the peaceful rally was disrupted by the police when teargas was fired into the middle of the crowd. Videos depicting the police firing tear gas as in a pincer movement on both sides of Lung Wui Road near Citic Tower at around 4 pm went viral on Hong Kong social media. People who were trying to push into the building to flee the gas found the doors locked and themselves cornered by police. As people trickled through the jammed central revolving door and a small side door, the police fired another two tear gas canisters into the trapped crowd, fuelling panic. Protesters attempted to break down another locked side door in a desperate attempt to gain entry. Pro-democrat legislators criticised the police action which nearly caused a stampede. Amnesty International also criticised the use of tear gas against the trapped crowd. Police brutality allegations =Use of force= Many videos of aggressive police action appeared online: one showed tear gas canisters being fired at peaceful and unarmed protesters, first-aid volunteers, and even reporters. One video showed a protester apparently being hit in the face by a police projectile; another showed police firing multiple rounds of tear gas at hundreds of trapped protesters outside CITIC Tower. A The New York Times video essay showed tear gas was deployed as an \\"offensive weapon\\" and that in several cases, unarmed protesters were beaten and dragged by police commanders. On 21 June, Amnesty International published a report examining policing tactics by its team of experts who examined footage of 14 incidents. Video showed apparent unlawful use of batons with the police beating unresisting protesters who were already subdued. The police was also criticised for using rubber bullets dangerously, with the police shooting projectiles directly at protesters' faces. There were also the improper use of riot control agents with peaceful, unarmed passers-by being pepper-sprayed, lack of visible police identification and restrictions on journalists and medics. Amnesty concluded that the use of force by police against the largely peaceful protest was unnecessary and excessive and that police had \\"violated international human rights law and standards.\\" The right eye of a male teacher from Diocesan Girls' School was ruptured by police projectiles, which permanently affected his eyesight. Protesters complained about the lack of identifying numbers on the uniforms of the Special Tactical Squad (STS), who were accused of police brutality. During the 2014 Occupy protests, the 2016 Mong Kok civil unrest, and the 9 June clashes, police uniforms had always displayed numbers. The numbers appeared to have disappeared since 12 June, when police officers began wearing newly designed uniforms without numbers. Although Secretary Lee claimed there was no space on the new uniforms to display their numbers, it is an operational requirement. Meanwhile, a spokesman for the police complained that personal information of more than 400 officers and about 100 of their family members had been posted online. Activists have also targeted senior officers in the force who are British, questioning the legacy of colonial violence. Top bodies of the United Nations condemned the actions of police. A spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet said she was concerned by the \\"escalation of violence\\" in Hong Kong, and Rupert Colville said the UN Human Rights Office had also reviewed credible evidence that police were using \\"less-lethal weapons in ways that are prohibited by international norms\\". Carrie Lam and Stephen Lo repeatedly sidestepped questions over police violence and rejected protesters' demands for an independent inquiry into the policing of the 12 June protest, only replying that the Complaints Against Police Office (CAPO) and the Independent Police Complaints Council (IPCC) ‚Äì both of which are internal institutions ‚Äì would look into the complaints. Chief superintendents Rupert Dover and David Jordan have been singled out by the activists for their handling and suppression of the protest, which injured 22 police officers and 81 protesters. Helen Goodman criticized superintendent Justin Shave for ordering his team to fire tear gas at Wu Chi-wai, an unarmed Legislative Councilor who was demanding to meet the police's commander. Two people sustained severe injuries according to the police. = Assaults on journalists= The Hong Kong Journalists Association (HKJA) accused the police of \\"trampl[ing] on reporters\\" and ignoring their safety. They complained that the police had unreasonably interfered with newsgathering by shining flashlights directly at them to disperse them. A driver for public broadcaster RTHK was hit by a tear gas round and sent to hospital after he suffered a cardiac arrest. The HKJA also said members complained that some police officers had been verbally insulting and abusive, including the use of profanity at a member of the press. Another online video showed riot police firing tear gas rounds directly at a journalist. The HKJA filed a complaint with the Independent Police Complaints Council (IPCC) claiming police had caused bodily harm to 26 journalists during the protests. The police press conference on 13 June was attended by reporters wearing high-visibility vests, helmets and gas masks in protest. Arrests The police arrested 32 people following the protest. Commissioner of Police Stephen Lo declared the clashes a \\"riot\\" and condemned the protesters' behaviour. Speaking in Cantonese, Lo used the term for \\"disturbance\\", but a police spokesman later clarified he meant \\"riot\\". Chief Executive Carrie Lam backed Lo, saying the protesters' \\"dangerous and life-threatening acts\\" had devolved into a \\"blatant, organised riot\\". Lo later backed down from the riot characterisation, saying that of all protesters, only five of them rioted. He added that \\"most of the other people who joined the public event were peaceful protesters. They did not need to worry that they committed rioting crimes.\\" However, the five people who were arrested for rioting were all released without charge on 24 October. = Hospital arrests = At least four protesters were arrested at hospitals while receiving treatment following clashes earlier that day. The police chief admitted that officers had accessed medical records, raising concerns over confidentiality of patient information. On 17 June, Legislative Councillor for the Medical constituency Pierre Chan presented a partial list that disclosed the information of 76 patients who had been treated in the emergency ward of a public hospital on 12 and 13 June, along with a note that stated \\"for police\\" which was written on the top-left corner of the document. Chan said such a list could be obtained through the clinical data system in some hospitals without requiring a password and accused the Hong Kong Hospital Authority (HKHA) for leaking patients' data to the police. The HKHA denied the accusation, stressing that it had never authorised anyone to print the patients' data for police officers. The Hong Kong Adventist Hospital in Tsuen Wan also reportedly refused to treat an injured protester and advised the person to go to Yan Chai Hospital before reporting him to the police. The private hospital told media that its protocol prohibits it from handling cases related to \\"criminal activities\\", adding that patients involved in such cases are referred to a public hospital. Tensions grew between the medical profession and the police force with both parties accused of verbal harassment and abuse. The police force later withdrew from posts at Queen Elizabeth Hospital and Yan Chai Hospital. Aftermath Marco Leung Ling-kit on scaffolding at Pacific Place before he fell to his death on 15 June. Protests against the extradition bill continued after 12 June, as the protesters only managed to delay the second reading of the bill. In response to the alleged police brutality, protesters began asking for the establishment of an independent commission of inquiry into police conduct and use of force during the protest and demanding the police to retract the \\"riot\\" characterisation. These demands later formed the foundation of the protesters' core five demands. On 15 June, Chief Executive Carrie Lam announced the \\"suspension\\" of the bill but stopped short of fully withdrawing it. Responding to the 12 June incident, she supported the police, calling them \\"restrained\\" and that she agreed with the riot characterisation. Shortly afterward, a 35-year-old man named Marco Leung Ling-kit climbed to the elevated podium on the rooftop of Pacific Place. Wearing a yellow raincoat with the words \\"Brutal police are cold-blooded\\" and \\"Carrie Lam is killing Hong Kong\\", he fell to his death after a five-hour standoff. On 16 June, the Civil Human Rights Front organised a massive rally, attracting 2 million people. The government rejected the formation of an independent inquiry and stated that the Independent Police Complaints Council (IPCC), an internal institution, would look into the complaints. Following the 12 June incident, the attention of the protests shifted to the confrontations between the police force and the protesters. The number of allegations of Police misconduct continued to increase in subsequent protests, as protests escalated into intense conflicts between both sides. Robert Godden, the founder of human rights consultancy Rights Exposure, named the June 12 incident as the \\"first escalation of force\\" and that most of the subsequent protests were \\"a spiralling escalation\\" based on what had happened on June 12. Commenting on the police's tactics, he described them as \\"very indiscriminate, very blunt, very unplanned, very unsophisticated\\". On 15 May 2020, a 21-year-old young man surnamed Sin was sentenced to 4 years in prison for his participation in the June 12 protest, becoming the first person to be jailed for the charge of rioting since the protest movement started.

Jin Daebang jeon is notable in that it features an immoral person as its protagonist in order to illuminate the importance of Confucian ethics and morality.  Authorship  The author and exact date of creation are unknown, but it is presumed to have been written sometime during the late Joseon Dynasty by a male author.  Plot  During China‚Äôs Song Dynasty, there was a man named Jin Daebang that lived in the Takju province. Jin Daebang was born into an affluent and prosperous household, in his parents‚Äô old age, but did not listen to his parents and became enamored with alcohol and womanizing. When his father passed away, Jin Daebang roams the country with a vagabond. He later becomes engaged to the daughter of the Yang household, but she was also a wicked woman. Jin Daebang and his wife drove out his mother and younger sibling from their family home and lived a life of debauchery with his father‚Äôs inheritance. Unable to bear this sight any longer, his mother goes to Jin Daebang‚Äôs home, where she finds her daughter-in-law alone. She begs Lady Yang, Jin Daebang‚Äôs wife, to persuade Jin Daebang to settle down and live a peaceful life. Lady Yang retorts that if Jin Daebang does not even listen to his parents, what makes her think that he will listen to his wife, and angrily tells his mother not to blame her for her son‚Äôs bad behavior. Weeping, his mother returns home. When Jin Daebang returns, Lady Yang lies and tells him that while he was gone, his mother visited and threatened to have Lady Yang put to death by dismemberment for committing a crime of morality. Jin Daebang finds his mother and expresses his fury towards her, upon which his mother goes to the district office and informs the county governor of the situation. The county governor, Kim Uibaek, is an exceedingly filial son. He summons Jin Daebang‚Äôs family and teaches them the error of their ways‚Äîadmonishing Jin Daebang‚Äôs mother for failing to properly teach her son, rebuking his younger brother for their lack of brotherly affection, informing Lady Yang of exemplary benevolent wives and the seven valid causes for divorce, and teaching Jin Daebang the ways of filial sons. The entire family realizes their failures and wrongdoings, and the county governor vacates their crimes and forgives them, sending them back home. Afterwards, the family lives peacefully together and a rumor spreads regarding Jin Daebang‚Äôs reforms. The emperor hears this rumor and builds a filial son‚Äôs memorial gate, grants Jin Daebang a government position, and renames their village ‚ÄúHyojachon‚Äù (Village of the Filial Son). Jin Daebang becomes the governor of Gangneung and rules the people justly and effectively. He faithfully supports his mother until her death, and has three sons and one daughter with his wife‚Äîall of them happily living a harmonious life. Jin Daebang thereafter lives for a long time until he peacefully passes away.  Features and Significance  Even though Jin Daebang jeon portrays a thematic consciousness regarding the concept of filial duty, it is different from Simcheong jeon (Ê≤àÊ∑∏ÂÇ≥ The Tale of Simcheong), another story of filial children. Whereas Simcheong jeon centers around a protagonist that consistently practices the concept of filial piety and sense of duty throughout the story, Jin Daebang jeon explores this theme through the character‚Äôs lack. This work was influenced by moral lesson books, but through the scene with the governor‚Äîa character who embodies Confucian morals‚Äîthese Confucian morals are presented in a manner that is easy for readers to understand. The scene with the governor quotes directly from moral lesson books, particularly the twelve stories of filial piety from the Samgang haengsil do (‰∏âÁ∂±Ë°åÂØ¶Âúñ Illustrated Guide to the Three Relationships). Because this work also features a plotline in which an unfair problem is reported to a government office and thereby solved, it is also considered a songsa soseol‚Äîa literary genre popular throughout the Joseon Dynasty where a civilian or member of the public makes an appeal to a governmental institution. This is because the problem of Jin Daebang mistreating his mother and younger sibling is solved by his mother‚Äôs entreaty to the governor.  Texts  There are currently 113 extant copies of Jin Daebang jeon: 93 handwritten manuscripts in Korean, 11 woodblock prints in Korean, 8 printed with movable metal type in Korean, and 1 handwritten manuscript in classical Chinese.

The story begins with the dream of Emperor Seonjo of Joseon, which foresees Japan‚Äôs invasion, proceeds to trace Admiral Yi Sun-shin‚Äôs activities as he successfully blocks Japan‚Äôs attacks, and concludes with Sa Myeongdang going to Japan and receiving an official document of surrender. While technically based on a true historical event, Imjillok includes a considerable number of fictionalized elements and is ultimately a work created to inspire national pride among the Korean people with regard to Japan.  Authorship  The author is unknown. The text is estimated to have been written sometime after the 17th century.  Plot  Emperor Seonjo has a dream in which a young girl brings a bag of grains to the royal palace. As soon as she sets it down, a huge fire erupts. Upon waking from his dream, Seonjo calls his vassals and asks them to interpret it for him. His second vice-premier, Choe Ilyeong, states that it is an omen of Japan‚Äôs impending invasion. Emperor Seonjo becomes angry, accusing him of stirring up unnecessary trouble during a time of peace, and banishes him. Three years later, in the summer of the Imjin Year, Japan mobilizes hundreds of thousands of men for its army and attacks Joseon. Admiral Yi Sun-shin, already aware of the disaster brewing, orders the construction of the so- called ‚ÄúTurtle Ships‚Äù and courageously fights, eventually dying in battle. The Japanese army approaches the Korean capital and Seonjo is forced to escape to Uiju. The Japanese army eventually manages to seize the territory extending from Hanyang (the former name for the capital of Korea) to Pyeongyang. Choe Ilyeong returns from his place of exile and finds Emperor Seonjo, recommending that he appoint General Kim Eungseo from Pyeongyan Province. Moreover, Kim Deok-ryeong from Goksan appears and performs Taoist magic on Kato Kiyomasa, a commander of the enemy forces, in order to retaliate and punish him. In the meantime, Yu Seongryong is sent to Ming China as an envoy to ask for help, but the Ming government refuses to provide any additional backup forces with the excuse that it is currently farming season. Yu Seongryong is forced to return to Korea, but Guan Yu (courtesy name: Guan Yunzhang) appears in the Emperor of Ming China‚Äôs dream. In his dream, the Chinese emperor is Liu Bei, and Zhang Fei, his sworn brother from the past, has become the King of Joseon. With this, the emperor calls over his general, Lee Yeosong, and states that he will pledge his help to Joseon. Lee Yeosong finds numerous faults with the emperor‚Äôs decision and continuously delays the army‚Äôs planned march to Joseon, but thanks to Yu Seongryong‚Äôs use of Taoist magic and clever manipulation of the circumstances, they eventually make it to Joseon. Finally, Lee Yeosong of Ming China and Kato Kiyomasa of Japan find themselves battling against each other, and with the help of Guan Yu, Lee Yeosong manages to defeat Kato Kiyomasa. The Japanese forces thereby suffer a crushing defeat and retreat back to their land. Kim Deok-ryeong makes numerous contributions to the battle as the commander of the righteous armies, but a traitor named Kim Sundal eventually frames him for a crime. The royal court demands Kim Deok-ryeong‚Äôs capture and execution. Although they attempt to behead him, their knife continuously breaks; whenever they try to shoot him with an arrow, the arrow snaps in half, and they are unable to kill him. Kim Deok-ryeong states that if they erect a tombstone that states, ‚ÄúFaithful Son, Kim Deok-ryeong,‚Äù he will voluntarily die and faces death courageously. Lee Yeosong, having defeated the Japanese army, travels the entirety of the eight provinces that compose the Korean peninsula and uses geomancy to divine the land, severing the connections of the mountains and streams. He does so because he senses that many magnificent heroes will come from Korea and he is filled with envy. Yet in the midst of his actions, a mountain deity disguised as an old man appears before him and scares him off, resulting in Lee‚Äôs retreat to China. Afterwards, the royal court sends Kim Eungseo and Kang Hongrip, two generals, to Japan to receive a formal letter of surrender, but Kang Hongrip fails in this mission. Kang Hongrip is seduced by the enemy to join their side and becomes the son-in-law of the Japanese Emperor, while Kim Eungseo refuses until the very end to capitulate to the enemy and proceeds to kill Kang and then commit suicide. Hyujeong (also known as Seosan daesa) then goes to greet King Seonjo, and his follower, Sa Myeong-dang, is sent to Japan where he succeeds in establishing peaceful relations between the two countries. The Japanese Emperor, hearing rumors that Sa Myeong-dang is the reincarnation of Buddha, tries all methods to assassinate him but he fails and is forced to write an official surrender. Sa Myeong-dang thus forms a treaty in which Japan presents tributaries to Korea and safely returns to his homeland.  Features and significance  Imjillok consists of numerous episodes and characters that were involved in the Japanese invasion of Korea in 1592, but there are considerable deviations from the factual historical record, such as Yi Sun- shin fighting in the early throes of the war and Kang Hongrip becoming the son-in-law of the Japanese Emperor. Though there are many existing copies of this story, there are also large differences between each version. Versions of Imjillok can generally be classified as the ‚Äúhistorical‚Äù version, the ‚ÄúChoe Ilyeong‚Äù version, and the ‚ÄúGuan Yu‚Äù version, but there are also versions that do not belong to any of the aforementioned categories. The ‚Äúhistorical‚Äù version is based on historical records and only partially includes fictional or fable-like elements. The ‚ÄúChoe Ilyeong‚Äù version is written with the fictitious character, Choe Ilyeong, as the main protagonist, and the ‚ÄúGuan Yu‚Äù version is based on an oral folktale and is the most fictional of all three versions.  Other  The South Korean game production company, Dreamware, made the real-time strategy games, ‚ÄúImjillok‚Äù and Imjillok 2: Joseon‚Äôs Counterattack.‚Äù  Archival materials  There are two separate versions of this text, including one written in Korean and one written in classical Chinese. Including both versions, there are approximately 50 extant versions of this text.

The Catholic Church has about 400,000 followers, while the Protestant groups have about 200,000 members. Currently, Christians are a minority community in Kanyakumari District comprising 46% of the population. Christianity is said to date back to the 1st century CE. According to the tradition, St. Thomas, one of the twelve apostles, landed on the Malabar Coast (Kerala) in 52 CE and introduced Christianity. It is believed he built St. Mary's Church in Thiruvithamcode in 63 AD. During the colonial period Italian, British, Dutch and Portuguese Christians came to Tamil Nadu.  Denominations  The Roman Catholic Church (Latin Rite), the Church of South India, The Salvation Army Church, the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church, the Jacobite Syrian Christian Church, the Syro-Malankara Catholic Church, the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church, the Evangelical Church of India, the Pentecostals, and other evangelical denominations are there. The Latin Rite of Roman Catholic Church is the oldest and the largest and has a homogeneous presence throughout the district. The second-largest church by number of members is the Church of South India.The vast majority are either members of the Latin Rite Roman Catholic Church or the Church of South India. = Roman Catholic Church = Our Lady of Ransom Church in Kanyakumari In 1542, St. Francis Xavier came to Kanniyakumari District.During the 16th century, he converted thousands of fishermen between Ramanathapuram and Kanyakumari to Catholicism. Between 1543 and 1544 Francis established forty-five churches in the coastal areas of Travancore. = Church of South India = The British East India Company, helped Protestant churches to grow in the Kingdom of Travancore and Madras Presidency. Conversions took place in Kanyakumari and Tirunelveli from among the Nadar and Paraiyan communities by the work of the Church Missionary Society and London Missionary Society. In 1818, 3000 members of the Nadar caste were said to have embraced Christianity. During the 18th century, on the request of German missionary Rev. J. C. Kohlhoff, William Tobias Ringeltaube came to Travancore. Over a period of ten years, Ringeltaube succeeded in building his mission. The first church was built at Mylaudy in September 1809. Many churches and schools were established in many more villages. A large church was built in Nagercoil that later became the home church for the CSI diocese in Nagercoil. The mission moved from Mylaudy to Nagercoil. Boarding schools were started for girls and education for women gained momentum. Even non-Christian students received education. A printing press was started by his mission in 1821. By 1838 a medical wing of the mission was established. = The Syro-Malabar Catholic Church = In 1996, the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church created its first \`Diocese of Thuckalay\`in Kanyakumari district, which was under the Syro-Malabar Catholic Archdiocese of Changanassery in Kerala until then. The same year the newly established \`Diocese of Marthandam split from the Archdiocese of Trivandrum in Kanyakumari district.  Caste system  During the period of Kingdom of Travancore, the present day Kanyakumari district was under the control of the Kingdom. It was caste-based. Those who belonged to lower castes were denied education, choice of occupation and basic dignity. The women of the lower castes and untouchables were not allowed to cover their breasts and they had to pay the mulakkaram (breast tax) to the Brahmin king if they wanted to cover their breasts. The tax was amount depended on their breast size. A woman baring her chest to Nambudhri brahmins was considered a sign of respect, by both males and females from the lower castes. Higher-class women covered both breasts and shoulders, whereas lower castes including Nadar and Ezhava women were not allowed to do so, to show their low status. Uneasy with their social status, many Nadars embraced Christianity, and started to wear long cloths. When many more Nadar women turned to Christianity, many Hindu Nadar women adopted the Nair breast cloth. From 1813 to 1859 laws were enacted and repealed by the Kingdom regarding the upper cloth issue. During this period waves of violence and agitation continued between the higher and lower castes. Due to the rebellion of lower castes, on 1859 the kingdom permanently permitted lower caste women to wear garments on their torsos. The missionaries and the church helped the lower castes to break some of the shackles that had bound them for centuries. Through the help of the Church and missionaries, the breast tax and the system of Oozhiyam (hard work for little or no pay) was abolished by the Kingdom.

Domestic  The Movement for Socialism (MAS), the governing party of Bolivia, called upon Morales' supporters to defend him. The Catholic Church in Bolivia said this was not a coup and Pope Francis asked for \\"peace and serenity\\". On 18 Dec, Osvaldo Chirveches, Jesuit priest and president of the Conference of Religious of Bolivia observed that \\"Bolivia is beginning to move and show more positivism. Given the current situation with the recent change of government there are discordant voices and opinions found but we hope that the elections called will mark a new horizon\\". On 7 January 2020, the Archbishop of El Alto, Eugenio Scarpellini, said that \\"Those that promote violence cannot become figures of authority\\". This was in response to statements made by Andr√≥nico Rodr√≠guez, a leading MAS figure and close associate of Morales, suggestion of a return to violence after the 22 January, the day which the new President would have been installed. In a poll comissioned by the Bolivian NGO group Red UNITAS conducted by Ipsos MORI released on 10 September 2020, 73% of the respondents believed there had been fraud in the 2019 elections, while on the question on whether they believed there had been a coup d'etat, 39% answered yes, while 58% answered no. 83% of the answered yes when asked if the crisis originated from the 2016 Bolivian constitutional referendum on whether to allow Morales further terms.  International  Several American governments and other countries and organizations have responded to the resignation; some have supported Morales and others have been supportive of new elections without him. =Supranational bodies= ‚Äì EU Foreign Policy Chief Federica Mogherini urged restraint and asked the parties to \\"lead the country peacefully and quietly\\" to new elections. On 21 December, the Technical Mission of Electoral Experts sent by the European Union published a 67 page report made similar observations and conclusions to that of the OAS. They noted that \\"there were minutes with an unusually high number of null votes, blank votes and a hundred percent participation of voters in a series of polling stations\\" and highlighted the general failure of the TSE to declare these irregularities.https://www.voanoticias.com/a/union-europea-detecto- errores-irregularidades-elecciones- bolivia/5215093.htmlhttps://www.uetrabajandojuntos.org/documentos/ ‚Äì On 11 November 2019, the UN Secretary-General Ant√≥nio Guterres expressed concern at the situation and urged the parties to \\"refrain from violence\\" and exercise \\"maximum restraint\\". On 13 December 2019, the UN welcomed a later agreement (known as the Law of Guarantees) made between the interim government and both chambers of government where Morales' MAS party hold majorities. Guterres commented that the \\"implementation of this law should pave the way for a greater normalization of the situation in the country and the holding of transparent, inclusive and credible elections.\\" On 15 January 2020, Jean Arnault, the envoy of the Secretary General in Bolivia, applauded the decision of the Plurinational Constitutional Court to extend the mandate of the interim government until 22 July 2020 in order to facilitate elections while at the same time stressing \\"it is essential to give up any violent action or threat of violence. In this context, the Personal Envoy joins the rejection expressed by many national actors to the recent declarations of Mr. Evo Morales.‚Äù Evo Morales had suggested the formation of \\"armed militias\\" like in Venezuela. Socialist International - On 3 January 2020, at a meeting of the Committee for Latin America of Socialist International, it was declared that they accepted the findings of the OAS and that Morales was not a victim of a coup. A document containing discussions of the Bolivian political crisis states that \\"‚ÄúAfter a broad mobilization of citizens in that country in protest of electoral fraud that was informed and verified by an audit conducted by the Organization of American States (OAS) of the elections that took place on October 20, the president Evo Morales did not suffer a coup d'etat.‚Äù The SI document states that the new situation in Bolivia ‚Äútoday entails enormous possibilities for Democrats for the full recovery of democracy and the installation of the values of pluralism, alternation and accountability by the authorities. \\" Organization of American States - On 5 December, the OAS published a 95-page report along with 500 pages of corroborating details as appendices. These included that an outside user who controlled a Linux AMI appliance with \\"root privileges\\" ‚Äî conferring the ability to alter results ‚Äî accessed the official vote-counting server during the counting and that in a sample of 4,692 returns from polling stations around the country, 226 showed multiple signatures by the same person for different voting booths, a violation of electoral law. On those returns, 91 per cent of votes went to MAS, approximately double the rate recorded elsewhere. Inter-American Commission on Human Rights - On 10 December the IACHR released a preliminary report investigating possible human rights violations during the crisis stating that there were \\"strong indications of human rights violations, with profound repercussions for the life of Bolivian society\\". Bolivia's interim government disputed the report, but expressed its willingness for an international investigation to look further into the acts of violence and human rights violations, and to establish who is responsible for them. On 12 December, an agreement was made to form an investigatory committee composed of four high-level technical professionals with abundant experience in the protection of human rights with these experts appointed by the IACHR. They were promised access to the records of \\"all criminal investigations and cases opened in this context, to public government reports on these events, and to all facilities, infrastructure, resources, and means necessary for [the committee] to do its job, as well as all security measures needed, in keeping with Bolivia‚Äôs legislation.\\" =American governments= ‚Äì The outgoing incumbent government of Argentina called for \\"all sides to talk to restore peace\\". Early responses * Outgoing president Mauricio Macri said that new elections will help Bolivia find a peaceful exit of the crisis. * Both houses of the National Congress‚Äîthe Chamber of Deputies and the Senate‚Äîpassed a \\"strong repudiation of the coup d'√©tat in Bolivia\\". * Members of Juntos por el Cambio, the political coalition that currently rules the country, are deeply divided in their responses, which range from denunciation of a coup to justification of the security forces' intervention. * The president-elect Alberto Fern√°ndez, as well as vice president-elect and former president of Argentina Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner, both condemned what they described as a coup and stated that the \\"democratic processes should be respected\\". Later responses * On 12 December, Morales departed from Mexico and took asylum in Argentina. * After Morales' statements about the formation of \\"armed militias\\" in Bolivia, the Chamber of Deputies of Argentina issued a resolution \\"to address the Executive Power of the Nation through the corresponding agencies (National Commission for Refugees) to deny the procedure of refuge of the former president of Bolivia, Evo Morales, and also revoke the procedure of asylum with which he has been benefited.\\" * According to Infobae, Argentine government officials conveyed a personal message from Fern√°ndez to Morales stating \\"Argentina does not endorse the popular armed militias because it goes against all the democratic spirit of living in peace and under the parameters of human rights.‚Äù * On 19 January 2020, one month after the installation of Argentina's new government, foreign secretary Karen Longevic announced their recognition of diplomats accredited by President Jeanine √Ånez and anticipated a \\"fluid relationship\\" with that nation. ‚Äì President Jair Bolsonaro called the situation a \\"lesson for everyone\\" and a \\"win for democracy\\". * Former President and opposition leader Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva condemned the Brazilian President's statement, dubbing the situation as a 'coup' and stating that it was \\"regrettable that Latin America has an economic elite who do not know how to live with democracy and the social inclusion of the poorest\\". ‚Äì Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland made a statement that Canada called on Bolivian political and social actors to \\"exercise restraint and avoid violence and confrontation\\". Global Affairs Canada (GAC) spokesman John Babcock stated that Canada would work with and support the √Å√±ez government in its caretaker role until elections are held. One GAC official stated that Canada would not use the term \\"recognition\\", nor would it likely refer to √Å√±ez as \\"President √Å√±ez\\". ‚Äì Chile's government expressed concern at the \\"interrupted electoral process\\" and called for a \\"prompt peaceful and democratic solution within the framework of the constitution\\". ‚Äì Colombia's foreign ministry issued a statement in which it called for the \\"mobilisation of the international community for a process of peaceful transition\\". ‚Äì Costa Rica's President, Carlos Alvarado Quesada has called for the politicians and citizens of Bolivia to act with respect and prudence in these times after the resignation of Morales and various members of the Government in the line of succession, and to support the democratic norms of Bolivia. He has further called for elections to renovate the democratic leadership which, he says, ought to prevail in Bolivia. ‚Äì Both Cuba's foreign minister Bruno Rodr√≠guez Parrilla and President Miguel D√≠az-Canel condemned what they termed a coup d'√©tat in Bolivia. In January 2020, Parrilla called President Jeanine √Å√±ez \\"liar,\\" \\"coup\\" and \\"self-proclaimed\\" in reference to her latest statements about the role of Cuban doctors in the country. On 24 January 2020, Bolivia broke off diplomatic ties with Cuba as a direct result of these statements. ‚Äì Mexico's foreign minister Marcelo Ebrard viewed the resignation as a coup and offered political asylum to Morales. ‚Äì The Nicaraguan government strongly condemned the situation and described it as a coup against Morales, stating that Nicaragua rejected \\"fascist practices that ignore the constitution, laws and institutionalism that govern the democratic life of nations\\". ‚Äì The Government of Peru called for a \\"transition to peace\\" and new elections in Bolivia. ‚Äì * U.S. President Donald Trump welcomed Morales resignation as \\"a significant moment for democracy in the Western Hemisphere\\" and he said in written statement that Morales's departure preserves democracy and paves the way for the Bolivian people to have their voices heard. President Trump also said that Morales resignation sends a strong signal to the \\"illegitimate regimes\\" in Venezuela and Nicaragua. * The State Department official said the country is monitoring the political situation in Bolivia and calling on civilian leadership to maintain control. It has also warned Americans to avoid all travel to Bolivia \\"due to civil unrest.\\" ‚Äì The Government of Uruguay condemned the events as a coup d'√©tat and expressed dismay at the \\"breakdown of the rule of law\\" in Bolivia, stating that it believed no argument could justify these acts following Morales' already expressed support for a new general election. ‚Äì The two disputed Venezuelan leaders gave opposing views. * Nicol√°s Maduro condemned what he called a coup against Morales. Maduro further urged \\"all social and political groups across the globe to protest the Bolivian military's action\\". * Juan Guaid√≥ took the opposite side, by supporting the \\"transition of power\\" and stating that Latin America was feeling a \\"democratic hurricane.\\" Guaid√≥ has also recognized √Å√±ez as interim president of Bolivia until new presidential elections are held. ** In response, Interim President Jeanine √Å√±ez recognized Juan Guaid√≥ as interim president of Venezuela and called on Guaid√≥ to appoint the new Venezuelan Ambassador to Bolivia, \\"who will be recognized immediately by our government.\\" The interim government also severed diplomatic relations with Venezuela's Maduro government, giving its diplomats 72 hours to leave the country. =Other governments= ‚Äì Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang called for dialogue between the two parties, for them to \\"resolve their differences peacefully within the framework and constitution and laws,\\" adding that China hoped Bolivia could \\"restore social stability as soon as possible.\\" ‚Äì The Iranian Foreign Ministry has condemned a \\"coup in Bolivia and change of government without a legal basis.\\" It also accused the United States of interfering the internal affairs of Bolivia. ‚Äì The Portuguese Assembly of the Republic passed a resolution expressing concern about the political situation in Bolivia, and called for the restoration of \\"democratic normality\\". Resolutions condemning or condoning Morales' resignation were rejected. ‚Äì Russia's Foreign Ministry urged all political forces to \\"show common sense\\" and accused Bolivia's opposition of \\"unleashing a new wave of violence\\" in the country, calling the events \\"an orchestrated coup.\\" On November 14, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov announced that Russia will recognize √Å√±ez as interim president until new elections are held. ‚Äì Spain criticized the role of Bolivia's police and Army in Morales' resignation, calling it an illegal \\"intervention\\", which marked a \\"return to moments in the past history of Latin America\\". It further urged the parties to \\"overcome the institutional vacuum\\" and ensure the security of all citizens, representatives of the media, civil society, as well as Morales, his relatives and members of his administration. ‚Äì Syria's foreign ministry strongly condemned what it considered a military coup in Bolivia and stated that it \\"expresses solidarity with the legitimately elected President Evo Morales\\". ‚Äì Turkey's Foreign Ministry has expressed concern over the developments in Bolivia that it deems have resulted in the resignation of President Evo Morales and stated that it believes in the principle that governments come into power through a democratic process.  Other  In an interview published by Agence France-Presse on 24 December 2019, Morales said from Argentina, \\"I'm absolutely convinced it's a coup against lithium,\\" backed by the United States. Morales had earlier made similar declarations during an interview with Glenn Greenwald of The Intercept. Several sources, however, including those from the mining industry itself, question this motive and the value of Bolivian's lithium.

In 1882, Ivanov was approached by German chemist Wilhelm Pfaff with a proposal to organize santonin production in Shymkent, as the city was near the Arys river valley, where santonin could be extracted naturally from plants. Ivanov built the Savinkov-Ivanov Chemical-Pharmaceutical Plant, and heavy equipment was carried from Altona, Hamburg to Shymkent through Orenburg on camel-drawn wagons with specially designed wheels and axels. The plant started production in 1882.http://www.kase.kz/files/emitters/CHFM/chfmp_2016_rus.pdfPolyn-Polno It is now known as Chimfarm JSC, a prominent pharmaceutical company in Kazakhstan. As the santonin was shipped to Japan, India, Germany and England, the plant became known around the world. In Ivanov's Turkestan enterprises, owned by his firm, 2700 workers were employed. In 1881, Ivanov established the Central Asian Commercial Bank. For many decades, Ivanov was looked up to as an elder by businesspeople in Tashkent, receiving the honorary title of Commerce Advisor. He was given several awards for his success. Ivanov was also known for the fact that he donated much money to the Russian Orthodox Church for the construction and arrangement of churches, charity houses, shelters and other structures.Tashkent in the past and present.

Authorship  The author of this work is unknown. There is a copy of Im Gyeongeop jeon that was published in 1780 by the Gyeonggi Provincial Office (currently held at the Yonsei University library in Seoul, South Korea) and we can thus estimate that the original work was likely created sometime before then.  Plot  Im Gyeong-eop loses his father at an early age and dutifully takes care of his mother. When he is 18 years old, he applies to take the military service examination and receives the highest score. He continues to rise in the ranks and makes a name for himself with his skill and talent. In 1624, he accompanies Envoy Lee Si-baek on the Winter Solstice Embassy to China as an army general. Soon afterwards, barbarians decide to attack the Qing. Qing China requests backup forces and Im Gyeong-eop having demonstrated his unusual talent and skill, is made Supreme Commander of Armed Forces by the king and sent to China. Through the use of extraordinary military tactics and strategies, Im manages to suppress the rebellion of the barbarians and becomes famous. Im Gyeong-eop spends six years in China and then finally returns to Joseon. Kim Jajeom, a premier in Joseon, nurses a desire to overthrow the regime but fearing Im Gyeong-eop, he does not dare to act on his desires. Meanwhile, Qing China gradually becomes more powerful under Hong Taiji. The Joseon Royal Court, seeing the precarious situation near the Yalu River, decides to make Im Gyeong-eop the leader of the provincial government in Uiju County to defend themselves. The Qing ruler, knowing that he cannot defeat Im Gyeong-eop, instead sends Yonggoldae, a general of the Qing, and his troops to Seoul. The Joseon king escapes to the Namhan Mountain Fortress, but ultimately surrenders. Im Gyeong-eop, later discovering this fact, attacks the Qing army on their way their home country and soundly defeats them. The Qing Emperor, in order to conquer the Ming, decides he must first eliminate Im Gyeong-eop. He thus sends a letter to Joseon commanding Im Gyeong-eop to attack the Ming army residing on Piseom island. Im Gyeong-eop informs this to Hwang Jamyeong, a Ming general, and the Ming forces decides to fake their surrender. The Qing Emperor figures out their plan and decides to capture Im Gyeong-eop and send him away. Im Gyeong-eop nevertheless manages to escape and seeks asylum in the Ming Empire. The Qing Empire slowly becomes stronger and invades Nanjing. Dokbo, one of the people that Im Gyeong-eop brought with him, secretly communicates with the Qing Empire and forges a letter from the general of the Ming Empire and sends it to Im Gyeong-eop. Im Gyeong-eop receives the fake letter and goes on a boat with Dokbo, only to be captured by the Qing army. The Qing Emperor attempts to reconcile with Im Gyeong-eop, but Im Gyeong-eop pulls out a knife and rebukes him. The Qing Emperor, resigned to Im Gyeong- eop‚Äôs steadfastness, sends him back to Joseon with various presents as offerings. In Joseon, Kim Jajeom‚Äôs power has significantly increased. Convinced that Im Gyeong-eop‚Äôs return will signal the demise of his plans of rebellion, Kim Jajeom helps brand Im Gyeong-eop as a traitor. Upon finally returning to his homeland after numerous hardships, Im Gyeong-eop is thrown in prison. Furthermore, Kim Jajeom secretly hires numerous soldiers that beat Im Gyeong-eop to death. Afterwards, the Joseon king has a dream where Im Gyeong- eop appears and the circumstances of Kim Jajeom‚Äôs crime are revealed. Kim Jajeom is executed, and at the end of the month, a memorial hall to extol Im Gyeong-eop is erected in the country. Im Gyeong-eop‚Äôs wife, Madame Lee, hears about his death and commits suicide. Im‚Äôs descendants retreat deep into the mountains and spend the rest of their lives farming and isolated from the rest of the world.  Features and Significance  A passage dated August 10, 1790 from Jeongjosillok (Ê≠£Á•ñÂØ¶ÈåÑ The Veritable Record of King Jeongjo) briefly mentions a murder at a tobacco store in Jongno. At the time, the general masses enjoyed novels through jeongisu (ÂÇ≥Â•áÂèü), professionals that would read novels out loud to the people. One person, listening to the recitation of Im Gyeongeop jeon, became excessively immersed in the scene where Kim Jajeom drove Im Gyeong-eop to his death. That person took a knife used for cutting and packaging tobacco and cried, ‚ÄúAre you Jajeom?!‚Äù and killed the reciter. The fact that the king at the time, King Jeongjo, mentioned this incident in his records indicates that this was an extremely famous incident at the time. Although the title of the novel that inspired the killing is not mentioned in the Jeongjosillok, Sim Nosung (Ê≤àÈ≠ØÂ¥á, 1762-1837)‚Äôs collection of texts, Hyojeonsango (Â≠ùÁî∞Êï£Á®ø The Collection of Hyojeon‚Äôs Writings), describes this incident in more detail. Due to his records, it is now known that the work that sparked the murder was, in fact, Im Gyeongeop jeon. A considerable portion of Im Gyeongeop jeon is fabricated. The only part that has historical validity is the episode that mentions Im Gyeong-eop, during the Manchu War of 1636, attacked and defeated 300 of the Qing Empire‚Äôs returning cavalry. Other parts of the story are fictional anecdotes made to enhance his heroism, such as the accounts of him being sent to the Qing Empire of China as an envoy and suppressing the rebellion there. Although Kim Jajeom and Dokbo are also real historical figures, they were not actually involved in plotting Im Gyeong- eop‚Äôs death. The episode where Kim Jajeom plots Im Gyeong-eop‚Äôs murder was first created by Song Siyeol (ÂÆãÊôÇÁÉà, 1607~1689) in Imjanggungyeongeopjeon (ÊûóÂ∞áËªçÊÖ∂Ê•≠ÂÇ≥ The Tale of General Im Gyeong-Eop). Song Siyeol paints the pro-Qing Dynasty faction member, Kim Jajeom, as a disloyal traitor, and Im Gyeong-eop as the incarnation of Ming loyalism. Thus, Im Gyeongeop jeon can be seen as a work that strongly establishes clear orientations with regard to hostility towards the Qing Dynasty (and pro-Qing factions) and loyalty to the Ming Dynasty.  Other  Kim Hun‚Äôs novel, Namhansanseong (ÎÇ®ÌïúÏÇ∞ÏÑ± The Fortress of Namhan Mountain), as well as ‚ÄúNamhansanseong,‚Äù a film of the same name that was based on Kim‚Äôs novel, are also works that center around the Manchu War of 1636.  Archival Materials  There are around 40 extant copies of Im Gyeongeop jeon, including versions in Korean and classical Chinese. The Korean versions include handwritten manuscripts, woodblock prints created in Seoul, as well as those printed with movable type. The classical Chinese versions are handwritten manuscripts.

In general, these works depict a female protagonist disguising herself as a man and then proceeding to fight in battles or demonstrate other forms of heroic behavior.  Main contents  = Concept of female hero fiction = Female hero fiction is a genre of literary fiction that features a heroic female character as its main protagonist and follows her life story. Typically, works of female hero fiction follow the archetypal structure of ‚Äúa hero‚Äôs life‚Äù in which a character, often descended from a noble family and born under unusual circumstances, is orphaned or suffers after running away from home, and finally emerges victorious only after undergoing numerous struggles. The fact that a woman plays the role of the hero can be understood as a modification in form of the traditional hero fiction, emerging as a later variation in a natural process of change and adaptation of the traditional hero fiction. In the early years, the hero fiction was thought of as a ‚Äúlow- ranking‚Äù or ‚Äúlow-class‚Äù literary genre, but as research into individual works has proliferated, the female hero fiction has come to be understood as a unique and independent category of fiction. = Female hero fiction as category = Representative works of female hero fiction are Seol Sojeo jeon (ËñõÂ∞èÂßêÂÇ≥ The Tale of Seol Sojeo), Bak ssi buin jeon (Êú¥Ê∞èÂ§´‰∫∫ÂÇ≥ The Tale of Madame Park), Okju hoyeon (ÁéâÁè†Â•ΩÁ∑£ The Good Union of the Jade and the Pearl), Hong Gyewol jeon (Ê¥™Ê°ÇÊúàÂÇ≥ The Tale of Hong Gyewol), Kim Huigyeong jeon (ÈáëÂñúÊÖ∂ÂÇ≥ The Tale of Kim Huigyeong), Bang Hanrim jeon (ÊñπÁø∞ÊûóÂÇ≥ The Tale of Bang Hanrim), and Jeong Sujeong jeon (ÈÑ≠ÁßÄË≤ûÂÇ≥ The Tale of Jeong Sujeong). In general, these works are characterized by a female protagonist disguising herself as a man and descriptions of war, but the female protagonist in Bak ssi buin jeon does not disguise herself as a man, and Seol Sojeo jeon does not feature any war stories. Thus, though all these works fall under the category of ‚Äúfemale hero fiction,‚Äù there are small differences between them. When considering these points, female hero fiction can be largely divided into two categories. The first subcategory of female hero fiction includes all the elements of disguising as a man and war stories. That is, this subcategory includes works that depict the course of the female protagonist's heroic life, during which the female protagonist disguises herself as a man and fights in the battlefield during wartime to demonstrate her heroic capabilities. Other examples include Hong Gyewol jeon, where the female protagonist disguises herself a man and then takes the civil service examination, appearing afterwards in the battlefield to save the land in a time of crisis and then is successful in the public sphere, as well as Bang Hanrim jeon, in which the female protagonist disguises herself as a man and lives as a man for the rest of her life, taking the civil service examination, battling in war, and demonstrating her heroic abilities. The second subcategory of female hero fiction comprises stories in which a female protagonist appears and demonstrates her abilities through activities in the public domain. Though the structure of these stories does not entirely adhere to the template of chronicling a hero's life, this subcategory includes stories where the female protagonist's heroic behavior is depicted. Examples include Seol Sojeo jeon, where the female protagonist does not participate directly in battle, but nevertheless disguises herself as a man and takes the civil service examination to become a respected civil minister (munsin), as well as Bak ssi buin jeon, where the female protagonist does not disguise herself as a man and does not leave the domestic sphere, but nevertheless demonstrates her heroic capacities and saves the land from a crisis. = Creation and spread of female hero fiction = There are numerous theories regarding the creation and spread of the female hero fiction as a literary genre. In 1724, Gwon Seob (Ê¨äÁáÆ, 1671-1759), a Confucian scholar, translated Seol Sojeo jeon (ËñõÂ∞èÂßêÂÇ≥ The Tale of Seol Sojeo) into classical Chinese, with the title of the translation as Beon seolgyeong jeon (Î≤àÏÑ§Í≤ΩÏ†Ñ The Translated Tale of Seolgyeong). The original work, Seol Sojeo jeon, and other similar works of female hero fiction, were thus introduced sometime before the mid-eighteenth century. We can thereby estimate the time period in which the female hero fiction as a literary genre first appeared, but defining the temporal order of individual works of female hero fiction remains difficult. Previous research, based on analysis of narrative content, proposed that works where female consciousness appears more strongly or have a more critical mindset towards patriarchy were produced in later time periods. However, this view has recently garnered criticism for its lack of empirical evidence. Moreover, in tandem with readers‚Äô demands, there has been an increase in perspectives that advocate for further subdividing works of female hero fiction into diverse affiliations.  Features and significance  = Significance of female consciousness in female hero fiction = The female hero fiction is a popular narrative form worthy of attention precisely for its mass appeal. Yet what is most notable about these works is their representation of female consciousness, particularly in light of the fact that society in the later Joseon Dynasty strictly observed the principle that men and women (and the domains they occupy) should be kept separate and that these novels portraying active female protagonists were nevertheless created and circulated. In the majority of female hero fiction, the female protagonists disguise themselves as a man in order to transgress the strict division (both spatial and societal) between men and women. While the trope of disguising themselves as a man has consistently appeared in the genre, it is generally only a temporary measure inserted to enhance the novel's entertainment value. However, this trope can also be seen as structured through the larger narrative form of telling a hero's life story. The length of the period of time during which the female protagonist continuously disguises herself as a man differs per each work of female hero fiction. In this sense, the following categories can be created: 1) works in which the female protagonist temporarily disguises herself as a man and then returns to the domestic space of the family and life as a woman (e. g. Okju hoyeon); 2) works in which the female protagonist, even after her true identity as a woman is discovered, continues to dress as a man and ventures out into the public sphere of men (e.g. Hong Gyewol jeon); 3) works in which the female protagonist lives her entire life as a man with the simultaneous existence of another female protagonist that retains her female identity (e. g. Bang Hanrim jeon). Why does the trope of disguising oneself as a man appear in female hero fiction? At the most basic level, the female protagonists in this genre disguise themselves as men in accordance with the concept of yeohwa winam (Â•≥ÂåñÁà≤Áî∑)‚Äîthat is, a woman changes and becomes socially recognized as a man. This reflects the social reality of the later Joseon Dynasty in which the entry of women into public affairs was fundamentally prohibited, while simultaneously reflecting women's desire for equality. In works of female hero fiction, the female protagonist obtains the opportunity to experience the world outside the domestic space of the home by disguising herself as a man. The female protagonist that disguises herself as a man is able to freely travel, and while meeting various helpers and teachers, learns military strategies, martial arts, poetry and calligraphy, and other forms of scholarship. Moreover, they take the civil service examination and are appointed to public office, make remarkable contributions during war and receive honors for their distinguished services, even able to acquire significant power and authority. However, regardless of how talented or exceptional the individual is, the actions of the female protagonists are still prohibited for women and it is only by disguising themselves as men that they can perform them. To summarize, the act of disguising oneself as a man allows the female protagonist to reveal herself and is a decision that indirectly allows her to fulfill her yearnings for societal achievements‚Äîthat is, an act that must be undertaken in order to break free from stereotypes regarding gender roles to receive acknowledgment for her skill and accomplishments in the public sphere. This kind of decision can also be interpreted as interrogating the stereotypes regarding fixed gender roles assigned to both men and women at the time. While women envy the freedom and independence granted only to men, this decision also reflects women's desire to achieve equal status and rights with men. = Limits of female consciousness in female hero fiction = However, critics have also pointed out the limits of female consciousness and subjectivity as represented in works of female hero fiction. Criticism has centered around the ways in which the female hero's accomplishments and personality are portrayed, in that the actions of the female protagonist after entering society essentially amounts to avenging their wronged parents, restoring a fallen family, or solidifying the state's power and authority. At first glance, it appears as if the female protagonist daringly breaks with collective values in order to pursue her own individual desires and self-realization, but ultimately, her actions strengthen the collective order and system. One example can be found in Bang Hanrim jeon where the female protagonist continuously lives as a man (that is, she does not revert to life as a woman even after her identity is discovered) and in the absence of a patriarch, she takes up that role to become analogous with a man and makes sacrifices in order to ensure her family's continuation and prosperity. In this sense, Bang Hanrim jeon has also been interpreted as a work that enforces patriarchy and patriarchal values. Moreover, others have criticized the ways in which the female protagonists‚Äô actions are unrealistic and take place in an overly idealized dimension‚Äîthat their deviations from social norms and success would never be permitted in society at the time. That the representation of female heroes are clearly differentiated from ‚Äúreal‚Äù women may provide female readers with a sense of pleasure, but their influence is limited to the sheer provision of entertainment and these female heroes‚Äô unparalleled talents cannot be unconditionally defended or exalted. Of course, these works of female hero fiction are certainly significant in that they catalyzed a recognition of an individual woman's talents, their heroic spirit, and the equivalence of skill between men and women. Nevertheless, critics have argued that it is necessary to bear in mind this recognition does not extend to ‚Äúgeneral‚Äù women to advance a notion of universal equality. For instance, there are scenes in Hong Gyewol jeon and Jeong Sujeong jeon in which the female protagonists kill their husbands‚Äô concubines. This kind of representation merely portrays antagonism between women in which they are positioned as victims within the institution of the family, and delineates the limits of female hero fiction in that the female protagonists are unable to escape or look beyond the patriarchal structure. = Interrogating the gender binary = In earlier works of female hero fiction where the trope of dressing as a man appears, the female characters, by simply changing their clothes from wearing a woman's to a man's and changing their appearances, are accorded new opportunities and possibilities. The fact that by dressing as a man, they can enter areas of society that were permitted only to men, fundamentally questions how men and women are different and alike, and asks what precisely makes a woman a ‚Äúwoman.‚Äù In particular, recent research that analyzes female hero fiction through scholar Judith Butler's theories on gender has proliferated. Specifically, female hero fiction has been interpreted as a literary genre in which the gender binary and prejudicial suppression relating to binary views of gender are interrogated, and where the fluidity of gender divisions and gender's variability are represented. With the incorporation of such theories in recent critical perspectives, female hero fiction can be interpreted in new ways. For instance, Bang Hanrim jeon, which has generally been interpreted as a work that supports patriarchal norms and beliefs (in that the female protagonist continuously lives as a man), has recently been re-interpreted as a work that actually signals the failure of the gender binary of ‚Äúman‚Äù and ‚Äúwoman‚Äù and the commensurate norms that accompany this binary.

The Columbia 24 is a development of the Islander 24, which in turn was derived from the wooden Catalina Islander. The Columbia 24 design was developed into the Watkins 25 in 1983, as well as many other designs. Development Glass Laminates built the Islander 24 for designer McGlasson, who had designed it as a fiberglass version of his wooden boat design, the Catalina Islander. The Columbia 24 was created by increasing the freeboard height and adding a new deck and coach house, based upon the design of the Columbia 29. The Islander 24 moulds incorporated a wooden planking look that was from the original wooden boat imprint. The wooden planking effect was not used on the Columbia designs, however. Production The design was built in the United States by Glass Laminates. The company was later known as Columbia Yachts. A total of 1,125 of all three models were built between 1962 and 1968. Design The Columbia 24 series are all recreational keelboats, built predominantly of fiberglass, with wood trim. They all have masthead sloop rigs, spooned raked stems, raised transoms, keel- mounted rudders controlled by a tiller and fixed fin keels. The keel is a truncated long keel design. The boat is fitted with an inboard engine for docking and maneuvering. Variants ;Columbia 24 :This model was introduced in 1962 and produced until 1964, with 261 built.

Tram route 10 entered operation in 1873, making it one of the oldest tram routes still active in Antwerp, next to Tram Route 4 (Antwerp) and Tram Route 7 (Antwerp). The current/present day route was opened on June 2, 2017 connecting the Astrid Pre-metro station, Antwerp South and P+R Schoonselhof in Hoboken with Wijnegem.  Trajectory  Tram route 10 (since September 16, 2017) begins at Wijnegem Fortveld terminus. From there it runs to Wijnegem Shopping Center, intersecting the R11 (Antwerp's Second Outer Ring), before making its way to Ruggeveld in Deurne. The route then rides through Deurne North town center via the Turnhoutsebaan, then proceeds to enter the premetro tunnel of Antwerp, near the R10 (Antwerp's Inner Ring). The tram, once underground stops at Borgerhout Zegel station, and then continues a non-stop trajectory under the Turnhoutsebaan and Carnotstraat towards Astrid station, nearest to Antwerp Central Station (Station Antwerpen-Centraal). Past Astrid, the tram continues to Opera Station, nearest Antwerp Central Station, then takes an overground route (similar to Tram route 8) towards Antwerp South (Antwerpen Zuid). From Antwerp South, it then makes its way through Antwerp South over the Orbital Ring of Antwerp, towards its final terminus, Hoboken P+R Schoonselhof. From there it takes an overground turning loop making its way back to Astrid, and back to Wijnegem Fortveld.  History  = Pre and Post World War I Route (1873‚Äì1933) = Tram route 11 was one of the original three Antwerp horse tram lines that were constructed in 1973. This was then replaced with the electric tram service on October 31, 1903, connecting the Melkmarkt in the city center and Borgerhout, briefly as tram route 11, before being given the permanent allocation of Tram Line 10. On June 12, 1906, the tram route was extended from the Turnhoutsepoort to the Turnhoutsebaan in Deurne, a total extension of . During World War I, the tram route 10 was restricted to the Turnhoutsepoort to the Melkmarkt in Antwerp City Center. These restrictions were lifted and trams would serve Deurne again from August 1, 1915. = Pre and Post World War II Route (1933‚Äì2012) = In 1933, tram route 10 ran between the Melkmarkt in the city center and the Schotensesteenweg in Deurne. During World War II, there were interruptions to this route. In 1979, they had plans to extend tram 10 to Wijnegem to take over the range of the two former NVMB (Dutch: Nationale Maatschappij van Buurtspoorwegen) Tram Lines. This move was completed on April 24, 2012, and therefore the tram line was expanded to serve Wijnegem Fortveld. = Previous Modern Day Route (2012‚Äì2017) = On April 24, 2012, entered the new Tram 10 route from Wijnegem to Melkmarkt in the city center. This route would run Tram 10 from Wijnegem to Deurne Village (Dorp) then overground to Antwerp Central Station and from there to Melkmarkt. In February 2017, due to work on the bridge over Antwerp's Orbital Ring road (on the Turnhoutsebaan), Tram 10 was diverted and would no longer serve Deurne Village, instead it would serve Deurne South and the Herentalsebaan and therefore make use of the Premetro Network. This diversion (omleidingen) would be maintained until Mid September 2017, after the new route had come into effect. In June 2017, DeLijn announced that Tram route 10 would be extended. This new route would make use of the new tunnel connecting Wijnegem to Antwerp via the Turnhoutsepoort. = Current Route (2017 onwards) = As part of the completion of the new tunnel on the Turnhoutsepoort, DeLijn extended the trajectories of both Tram route 8 in Wommelgem and Tram route 10. Tram route 10 would be extended to now connect Wijnegem to P+R Schoonselhof in Hoboken, but for the first few months following this route change, Tram 10 would still follow the diversion via Deurne South. Since September 16, 2017, Tram route 10 has driven without diversion between Wijnegem and Hoboken P+R Schoonselhof via the new tunnel.  Future  Tram route 10 runs along the unopened pre-metro stations of Floorplein, Drink and Carnot. According to the Master Plan project in Antwerp (2020), the plan is to open all of those premetro stations in the long run. Currently, Opera Station is expected to be re-serviced by all trams starting December 8, 2019. In the same Master Plan, tram route 10 has plans to be extended towards Schilde. The new bridge over the Albert Canal in Wijnegem would be used for this, however, it is not currently suitable for trams. Therefore an extension to the aforementioned bridge would need to be completed first. It was also included that Tram route 24 would be serviced as far out as Hemiksem and later to Schelle. It is now however likely that Tram route 10 would probably be extended to service these places instead.  Rolling stock  Service on the previous tram route 10, was provided by 10 PCC cars between March 1966 and 2012. In April 1975, two axle pre-war trams were also used. Since its extension to Wijnegem in 2012, Tram route 10 was covered mostly by a mix of PCC cars and HermeLijn (HermeLijn) trams. Since the end of February 2016, most Tram route 10 is served by the new Albatross tram, with PCC cars getting occasional use.

It is a parish church of the Evangelical Reformed Church of the Canton of Vaud. It is listed as a heritage site of national significance. History The church of Saint-√âtienne was first mentioned in 1134‚Äì1143, even though it may have been built earlier. It was situated outside the Medieval village and was the counterpart of the Chapelle Notre-Dame located on the hill. The church was nicknamed \\"the cathedral of Broye\\", a region around the Broye river, by the residents of Moudon. It was modelled after the Gothic style. After a bell tower was added in 1420, the church was enlarged and renovated between 1495 and 1499, then again between 1499 and 1502. Paintings were added to the vaults between 1506 and 1511. After the conquest by the canton of Bern in 1536, the side altars and the statues of the church were destroyed and the building became a Reformed temple. The building was restored several times (mainly the interior) around 1563 (when a new stone communion table was added) and 1695 (new pulpit made of molasse). The organ and the current rostrums were installed in 1764. The church was listed among the Cultural Property of National Significance.

His poetry has been reviewed as demonstrating aspects of aestheticismAestheticism is a critical terminology that refers to art that pursues beauty. It asserts the autonomy of art and that aesthetic value is art‚Äôs main priority. See the entry on Aestheticism on wikipedia. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aestheticism with its arrangement of exotic subject matters and erotic poetic diction to combine heterogeneous poetic language in an unfamiliar way. = Early writing = In his earlier writings, Kim often described sensual impressions of objects under examination in an unfamiliar way.Kwon, Gyeonga. ‚ÄúThe Power of a Tranquil Landscape: On Kim Youngtae‚Äôs Poetry.‚Äù Poetry & World 2 (June 2003): 132‚Äì41. Although the subject was described in an objective manner, he would simultaneously use strange words and diction in order to construct a fantasy- like atmosphere.Lee, Gyeongsu. ‚ÄúConfronting the Era as Methodological Participation.‚Äù In Eoreumsaniui bohaeng. Jisik, 1984. By simultaneously representing two objects that seemingly had no relation to each other whatsoever, readers are thus able to imagine a different world. = Later writing = In his later writings, the sensuous impressions of objects still appear, but his own subjective voice intervenes in these descriptions, revealing Kim's own introspection regarding himself and his life.Kwon, Gyeonga. ‚ÄúThe Power of a Tranquil Landscape: On Kim Youngtae‚Äôs Poetry.‚Äù Poetry & World 2 (June 2003): 132‚Äì41. The distance between the object and the self disappears, and the object is felt to provide some sort of consolation to the self. With his final poetry collection released in 2005, Nugunga danyeogatdeusi (ÎàÑÍµ∞Í∞Ä Îã§ÎÖÄÍ∞îÎìØÏù¥As If Someone Stopped By), Kim Youngtae's poetry becomes ‚Äúa conversation with the self.‚ÄùSee the introduction to Nugunga danyeogatdeusi on the Aladin Bookstore website. https://www.aladin.co.kr/shop/wproduct.aspx?ItemId=548114 The narrator observes the object, experiencing it in a sensuous manner until he finally inserts himself and completes the landscape. While feeling a sense of impotence towards the self and the life that one has lived, through the sheer existence of minor things and seeing them in a new light, life is illuminated with a new meaning and undergoes an active transformation.Kim, Inhwan. ‚ÄúThe Shade of Love.‚Äù In Nugunga danyeogatdeusi. Moonji, 2005. = Poeticization of experiences with art = Kim Youngtae constructs his poetic world by giving language to diverse forms of art. He has been noted for perceiving and expressing art in and of itself in his works, especially for using his personal artistic experiences as the foundation for his works‚Äîan unusual characteristic that is difficult to find in other Korean poetry.Kwon, Gyeonga. ‚ÄúThe Power of a Tranquil Landscape: On Kim Youngtae‚Äôs Poetry.‚Äù Poetry & World 2 (June 2003): 132‚Äì41. For instance, his poem ‚ÄúBalladeu‚Äù (Î∞úÎùºÎìú Ballad) is a linguistic rendering of Fr√©d√©ric Chopin's piano compositions.

Born in Nuremberg, Mahlein's father was a member of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) who was arrested by the Nazis in 1935 and sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison. Leonhard undertook an apprenticeship in printing, but was forced to leave his initial placement due to his own anti-Nazi views. He was eventually able to complete his apprenticeship, and joined the Printing and Paper Union, becoming leader of its youth section in Nuremberg, and also chaired his local works council. From 1951 until 1956, Mahlein worked as a teacher of printing. He was a supporter of the KPD until 1952, but in 1956, he joined the Social Democratic Party of Germany, and was also elected as the deputy chair of the Printing and Paper Union in Bavaria. From 1965, he worked full-time for the union as the chair of its Bavaria district. In 1968, Mahlein was elected as national president of the Printing and Paper Union, the senior role in the union. He was also elected to the executive of the International Graphical Federation (IGF), and was its president from 1976. His leadership of the union was marked by industrial action in 1973, 1976 and 1978, concerning pay, conditions, and computerisation. He was able to expand membership of the union by accepting journalists and writers into membership. In 1983, Mahlein unexpectedly decided not to re-stand for the union leadership. Instead, he became joint editor of Nachrichten zur Wirtschafts- und Sozialpolitik, a monthly magazine linked with the KPD, until his death in 1985.

It is endemic to Taiwan. It is often included in the family Phasmatidae, although sometimes excluded from it when the family is strictly delimited. It derives its specific name from its type locality, Lanyuh Island, commonly known as Orchid Island. Distribution Phasmotaenia lanyuhensis is known from its type locality, Lanyuh Island (Taitung County). It is very common on the island. P. lanyuhensis is the most northern Phasmotaenia species, otherwise known from the Philippines, Micronesia, New Guinea, and Fiji. Description Phasmotaenia lanyuhensis is similar and closely related to P. sanchezi, the type species of the genus Phasmotaenia from the Philippines, but has a more robust body, relatively shorter mesothorax, larger head, and shorter antennae. Furthermore, female P. lanyuhensis have more prominently swollen mesothorax, shorter alae, and shorter subgenital plate. P. lanyuhensis was described based on four females and three males, including three mating pairs. Males measure and females in body length. They are slender-bodied insects with tiny or absent fore wings and short hindwings. Coloration varies from pale brown to dark brown to green. The hindwings are black in females and brown in males. The thorax is broadened in females and elongate in males. The legs are long and slender and bear numerous small serrations; the femora may have four dark brown bands in females. The head is smooth and much longer than it is wide. The eyes are small. The antennae are brown and have 23 segments. The egg capsule is long. Habitat This species is very common on Orchid Island where they primarily occur in the forested areas, hanging underneath branches in the daytime. Their food plant is Bischofia javanica (although in captivity they readily accept Turpinia formosana). They roam around their food plant about an hour before sunrise, mostly no higher than about ten meters above the ground.

He began his career at the CNRS in 1962 in Marseille where he became Professor of Biochemistry in 1965.He accepted the Chair of Biochemistry at the University of Nice in 1968. He founded the CNRS Biochemistry Centre there, which he managed until 1989, when he moved to the Sophia Antipolis science park to direct the CNRS Institute of Molecular and Cellular Pharmacology, which he had just created and which he managed until 2004. During his academic career in Nice/Sophia Antipolis, he was successively Professor of Biochemistry (Faculty of Sciences), Director of Research seconded to the CNRS and Professor of Pharmacology PU-PH (Faculty of Medicine).Michel Lazdunski was a member of the Scientific Council (1997-2001) and the Board of Directors (2001-2005) of the CNRS and the Council of the European Molecular Biology Organisation (1990-1995). He has chaired many committees including the UNECE Life Sciences Committee (Human Capital and Mobility Programme 1996-1997) and the National Coordinating Committee for Life Sciences (2001-2002). He was elected a full member of the French Academy of sciences in 1991. He was appointed senior member of the Institut universitaire de France in 1991 for a five-year term, renewed in 1996.  Scientific contribution  The first part of Michel Lazdunski's scientific career (awarded the CNRS Silver Medal) was devoted to enzymology. He then focused on exploring the molecular machines, the ion channels, that generate bioelectricity in the brain, peripheral nervous system, heart, muscles, vessels and hormone-secreting endocrine systems and are responsible for multiple pathologies. He played a pioneering role in the analysis of ion channels permeable to sodium, calcium and potassium. He played a pioneering role in the study of their pharmacology by introducing many toxins, many venoms and important drugs for hypertension (calcium blockers) or diabetes (antidiabetic sulfonylureas)Amoroso, S; Schmidantomarchi, H; Fosset, M; et al., ¬´ Glucose, Sulfonylurea, and Neurotransmitter Release - Role of ATP- sensitive K+ Channels, : ¬ª, Science, feb 1990, 247, issue: 4944, p. 852-854 The most recent work of his team has completed these pharmacological studies and amplified the discovery of new substances from venom with strong potential therapeutic possibilities.

National Association of African-American-Owned Media, 589 U.S. ___ (2020), is a United States Supreme Court case related to protections against racial discrimination in the Civil Rights Act of 1866. The case relates to whether cable television operator Comcast engaged in racial discrimination in refusing to carry channels from Entertainment Studios, a minority-owned network founded by Byron Allen. In a unanimous opinion in March 2020, the Court ruled that under the Civil Rights Act, Allen was burdened to show that race was but-for the sole reason Comcast failed to enter into a contract with his network.Comcast v. Nat'l Ass'n of African-American-Owned Media, . The parties reached a settlement after the Court's decision. Background Byron Allen founded Entertainment Studios in 1993 originally to produce syndicated television shows, but eventually grew to include a number of lifestyle channels. Since as recent as 2014, Allen started negotiations with Comcast to have the cable provider run Entertainment Studio's lifestyle channels, but they could not agree to contract terms. Allen filed a lawsuit (filed under both Allen's National Association of African-American-Owned Media and Entertainment Studios) in the United States District Court for the Central District of California against Comcast in February 2015, seeking in damages and citing that Comcast had used racial discrimination to deny him a contract, in violation of section 1981 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866.. Allen alleged that Comcast was discriminating against 100%-minority owned networks like Entertainment Studios, as only of the total carriage fees Comcast paid were to 100%-minority owned networks. Comcast refuted the accusations, stating they had been in negotiations with Allen in good faith for several years to strike a deal. Comcast claimed that the lawsuit was \\"an ordinary business grievance masquerading as a racial discrimination claim\\". Around the time of this filing, Comcast was in the midst of trying to acquire Time Warner, and Time Warner had been named in Allen's suit, but by April 2015, Comcast called off its acquisition. Allen also named several other groups including the NAACP, the National Urban League, the National Action Network, Al Sharpton and Meredith Attwell Baker, arguing that they had supported Comcast's earlier 2011 merger with NBCUniversal through a memorandum of understanding (MOU), in which Allen claimed was to \\"whitewash Comcast‚Äôs discriminatory business practices\\". In the Comcast case, Judge Terry Hatter at the District Court had dismissed the case without prejudice in August 2015, stating that Allen had \\"failed to allege a plausible claim for relief\\", but later allowed Allen to refile an amended complaint. Allen's revised complain left only Comcast and Time-Warner as the defendants, but still asserted racial discrimination related to the MOU that had been signed earlier. By May 2016, Hatter had again dismissed Allen's suit for the lack of claim of relief, but allowed Allen to file a second amended claim. =Simultaneous cases= Allen had launched a similar lawsuit in December 2014 against AT&T;, which owned DirecTV, but this was settled out of court by the end of 2015, with AT&T; agreeing to pick up Allen's channels. Allen also filed a lawsuit against Charter Communications in January 2016, also in the Central District Court of California. The Charter case was approved of by Judge George H. Wu, finding that Allen had provided sufficient claims for potential discrimination. =Ninth Circuit appeal= Allen had appealed the ruling in the Comcast case to the Ninth Circuit, while Charter had done the same for its case. In November 2018, the Ninth Circuit overturned the Comcast case dismissal and rejected the Charter's request to dismiss, stating that, in the case of the Charter decision, \\"Plaintiffs' allegations regarding Charter's treatment of Entertainment Studios, and its differing treatment of white-owned companies, are sufficient to state a viable claim.\\" The Ninth Circuit rejected arguments made by Comcast and Charter that they had \\"editorial discretion\\" to select channels for their cable line-ups under the First Amendment. Supreme Court Comcast petitioned the Supreme Court of the United States for writ of certiorari to challenge the Ninth Circuit's decision, which the Court granted in June 2019. (Charter separately filed its own petition to the Supreme Court in March 2019, which as of November 2019 remains at the petition stage, and thus not joined with the Comcast case.) Oral arguments for the case were heard on November 13, 2019. The arguments focused on which of two tests to use to determine the merits of Allen's case that had been considered in the case's prior legal history. The first was whether there was evidence that race was a \\"motivating factor\\" in Comcast's decision to deny entering a contract with Allen, which had been used by the Ninth Circuit. This took into account the language of the Comcast/NBCUniversal MOU that Allen claimed established Comcast's motivation. The other \\"but-for\\" test was suggested by Comcast, in that if there was no race issue involved, that Comcast would still not have entered a deal with Allen. The Court released its opinion on March 23, 2020. In a unanimous decision vacating the decision of the Ninth Circuit and remanding the case to be reheard, the Court sided with Comcast's \\"but-for\\" test, in that Allen had to have shown that race was the sole deciding factor for the case, rather than the possibility that it may have only been a motivating factor. The decision was based on prior rulings from University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center v. Nassar.. Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote the majority opinion joined by all but Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who wrote a concurrence in part that concurred in the judgement. Ginsburg specifically wrote to counter Comcast's claims that such discrimination can only be only evaluated at the finalization of contract, as such discrimination could occur at any time during contract negotiations, such as when a bank requests letters of reference for a potential lender. Ginsburg also wrote, as a footnote, of having stated her past concern that \\"a strict but-for causation standard is ill suited to discrimination cases and inconsistent with tort principles\\" but recognized it was an established principle from past Supreme Court cases. Impact Civil rights organizations and leaders have condemned Comcast for its behavior in the case. In the weeks leading to the oral arguments at the Supreme Court, Representative Bobby Rush argued that Comcast should be broken up, stating \\"Comcast has enjoyed the largesse ‚Äì as has the cable industry, in general ‚Äì of the African-American and other minority communities and has reached such prominence that it now these communities with a cold, callous corporate insensitivity that is stultifying, arrogant, harmful, and intensely painful.\\" Ian Millhiser of Vox said of the Supreme Court decision that it represented a change in the liberal justices' stance of the court to approach discrimination cases through a mixed motive discrimination, as previously set out in Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, which gave plaintiffs seeking discrimination a greater benefit of the doubt than the \\"but-for\\" ruling from Comcast. Millhiser referred to the cases of Gross v. FBL Financial Services, Inc. and University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center v. Nassar as cases since Price Waterhouse that went against the mixed motive allowance. Millhiser suggested that the liberal side of the court may have given in to the conservative majority in Comcast to establish that the liberal side of the court was respecting the principle of stare decisis from previous court decisions such that the conservative side should also uphold stare decisis in other pending decisions. In June 2020, Allen and Comcast reached a settlement to end the lawsuit, with Comcast agreeing to carry three of the channels in Allen's lineup in addition to the Weather Channel which Allen had acquired in the interim, in additional to other terms. In Allen's concurrent action against Charter Communication in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, Judge George H. Wu ruled in August 2020 that Allen's suit could proceed based on evidence Allen had provided that met the requires met by the Supreme Court in the Comcast ruling.

Education and career Scholz studied mathematics at the University of Bonn and the University of Warwick from 1968 to 1975 with Diplom from the University of Bonn in 1975. In 1979 he completed his doctorate (Promotion) at the University of Bonn with thesis Entwicklung des Mannigfaltigkeitsbegriffs von Riemann bis Poincar√© (Development of the concept of manifold from Riemann to Poincar√©) under the supervision of Egbert Brieskorn and Henk J. M. Bos. In 1986 Scholtz habilitated at the University of Wuppertal. There he became in 1989 an associate professor of the history of mathematics and retired in 2012. He also works at the University of Wuppertal's Interdisziplin√§ren Zentrum f√ºr Wissenschafts- und Technikforschung (IZWT, Interdisciplinary Center for Science and Technology Research), which he co-founded in 2004. In 1993 he was a visiting professor at the Institut f√ºr Wissenschaftsgeschichte (Institute for the History of Science) at the University of G√∂ttingen. Scholz's research deals with the emergence of the manifold concept developed by Riemann, Poincar√© and others, as well as the historical relations of mathematics to its applications in the 19th century. Scholz has investigated Karl Culmann's graphic statics, the determination of the crystallographic space group by Evgraf Fedorov, the applied mathematics of Hermann Grassmann, and the relation of Gauss's ideas on non-Euclidean geometry to his geodetic work. Continuing these investigations into the beginnings of group theory and concept of a mathematical manifold, Scholz has dealt intensively with Hermann Weyl's work in connection with general relativity theory, cosmology, gauge theory, and quantum mechanics and, especially, Weyl metrics in cosmology. Scholz wrote an article on Oswald Teichm√ºller for the Dictionary of Scientific Biography and an article, with Norbert Schappacher, in the Jahresberich (annual report) of the Deutsche Mathematiker Vereinigung (DMV). Scholz also pursued connections between the history of mathematics and philosophy, such as the historical and philosophical relations of Riemann's work to that of Johann Friedrich Herbart, of 19th-century crystallography to the work of Schelling,Scholz Schelling und die dynamistische Kristallographie im 19.

Research Career, Publications, and Curated Exhibits  Richard Zettler has conducted archaeological excavations at sites in Syria, Turkey, and Iraq. From 1989 to 2007, he excavated at Tell es- Sweyhat, an Early Bronze Age site occupied from the third millennium BCE. He has published studies and excavation reports on the Ur III Temple of Inanna and Kassite buildings at Nippur, and on settlement patterns in Tell es- Sweyhat. He co-curated the Penn Museum‚Äôs traveling exhibition on the ‚ÄúTreasures from the Royal Tomb at Ur‚Äù. Richard Zettler has also written studies on the history of American archaeologists in the late Ottoman and early post-Ottoman Middle East, and on the history of the Penn Museum. One article appeared, for example, in a volume considering the legacies of the first Ottoman director of antiquities, Osman Hamdi Bey, who received an honorary doctorate from Penn. Another examined the Penn Museum‚Äôs late nineteenth-century excavations in Nippur ‚Äì a site at which he himself has conducted extensive research.  Heritage Conservation  Within a year of the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, Richard Zettler began to address public concern about the looting of antiquities in Iraq. In an interview with the Philadelphia Inquirer, he expressed concern about the security of standing monuments, including mosques, as well as a reconstructed 2,000-year-old ziggurat at the site of Ur, and an archway at Ctesiphon from 129 B.C. He also expressed concerns about mounds of buried ruins that archaeologists had not yet excavated. National Public Radio interviewed him on the subject of Iraqi antiquities looting as well in 2004. In 2018, Zettler secured a three-year grant from the U.S. State Department to identify and where possible restore cultural heritage sites ‚Äì including churches, mosques, shrines, museums, and stately homes ‚Äì that Islamic State forces damaged in and near Mosul, Iraq.

Her murder has never been solved.  Background  Emily was born in Italy in October 1989. Her mother was Katie and her father was Marco Salvini. Katie graduated from Sussex University with a degree in politics and met Marco on a holiday in Italy in the late 1980s. They were married for about a year before Emily was born and lived near Lake Garda for three years before moving to Caversham in Reading, close to Katie‚Äôs parents. Emily had a brother, Zach, who was four years younger than her. At the time of the attack on the Salvini's‚Äô home, Katie and Marco had separated and Katie and her two children were the only occupants of the semi-detached rented house on Hemdean Road in Caversham. Katie worked part-time in a local pub and Marco had regular contact with their children and was reported to visit every Saturday at 10.00am to take the children out. Emily was a pupil at Caversham Primary School which was very close to her home.  The Crime  On the night of Friday 2 May 1997, Zach, 3, got into bed with his mother at some point early in the night and Emily, 7, was asleep in her bedroom at the back of the house. At 1.30am on Saturday 3 May, telephone lines were cut on three telegraph poles on Hemdean Road, this resulted in thirty houses losing their telephone connection. Neighbours were woken by screaming and a ringing burglar alarm some time after 4.00am on Saturday morning. Flames were seen billowing out of the Salvini‚Äôs home. Katie was woken by Zach crying and got up realising it was very hot and there was a glow around the bedroom door. When she opened the door, flames rushed into her bedroom, they were as high as the ceiling. Katie put Zach, who was very distressed, out of the bedroom window and onto a small ledge on the top of the downstairs bay window. She was desperate to reach her daughter, Emily, but couldn‚Äôt get through the flames to her room. She handed Zach down to one of the neighbours who had arrived to help. He persuaded her to leave the house too, despite her wish to save her daughter. Katie fell from the bay window ledge, witnesses described her and Zach‚Äôs face, hands and feet as black and most of their clothing was burnt away. Neighbours tried to get to Emily in the back bedroom by putting a ladder up at the back of the house. Meanwhile a passing motorist had alerted the fire brigade on their mobile phone and the firefighters broke down the front door and managed to rescue Emily from her bedroom. All three of the family members were taken to the Royal Berkshire Hospital where Emily died of smoke inhalation. Her mother and brother‚Äôs injuries were so severe that they were transferred to a specialist unit at Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Buckinghamshire. Katie and Zach were seriously ill after the fire and both underwent surgery for their burns. Zach was able to leave hospital a few weeks later and was looked after by relatives. Katie finally left hospital just over a month after the attack.  The investigation  Four hundred people were interviewed in the first few months of the investigation. Thames Valley Police stated that the ‚Äòcalculated and pre- planned‚Äô arson attack was a deliberate attempt to murder Katie Salvini and her children. Petrol had been poured through the letterbox of the family‚Äôs front door and then set alight. On the day of the attack, police closed off part of Hemdean Road and a mobile incident room was set up in the street. Police interviewed neighbours and searched gardens, among the items they were looking for was a can of flammable fluid. Two men were arrested and held for questioning over the weekend, they were later released without charge. Mrs Salvini had reported to police that her telephone cable had been cut two weeks previously, two men had been questioned then but released without charge. A few weeks after the attack, police appealed for two men to come forward. A neighbour saw them walking down Hemdean Road and then run back to a blue car at the time of the attack. Both men were described as Asian with one being in his 20s and the other in his 40s. Police were keen to speak to them in the hope they had seen the arsonist. A man was arrested on 17 June, held overnight and then released without charge. In July 1997, police issued an unusual artist‚Äôs impression of a ‚Äòman without a face‚Äô, which was based on a description given to them by two witnesses who were not close enough to see his facial features. They saw the man at the junction of Hemdean Road and Victoria Road, yards from the Salvini home at 4.40 am, shortly before the fire. He was described as being between 5ft 8in and 5ft 11in with short dark hair. He was wearing a padded light lumberjack-style shirt or jacket with a predominantly white check pattern. In August, police cleared an overgrown area at the junction of Hemdean Road and Victoria Road where the ‚Äòman without a face‚Äô had been seen standing. It was the second time the area had been searched and nothing of interest was found. Drains in the area were checked for discarded items as well as the River Thames.  A suspect  On 6 August 1997, 33 year old Stephen Duffy and his common-law wife were arrested at their home in Emmer Green. Forensic tests were carried out on his vehicle and the couple‚Äôs home was searched. Duffy had been previously interviewed by detectives and was arrested on suspicion of murder. His partner was arrested on suspicion of aiding and abetting. Both were released without charge. More details emerged about Duffy when police refused his application for the return of his gun licence in a court hearing in Reading on 23 October 1998. Counsel for Thames Valley Police described Duffy, a wine shop owner, as ‚Äòcruel and dangerous‚Äô, that he remained a suspect in the Salvini murder and would remain so for the foreseeable future. It was reported that Duffy was one of two male suspects in the enquiry and neither had been eliminated. Police had interviewed three former partners of Duffy who had described his violent, abusive and controlling behaviour. He had reportedly caused one to miscarry after pushing her down the stairs and kicking her in the stomach. Duffy denied all allegations against him and was never charged in connection with the Salvini murder. It was reported in 2002 that a 37 year old man, Stephen Duffy, of Cavendish Road, Emmer Green, was found guilty of sex with an underage girl. He was jailed for a year and ordered to be put on the sex offenders register for ten years after release.  Emily‚Äôs funeral and inquest  Emily Salvini‚Äôs funeral was held in Caversham on Thursday 19 June. The inquest into her death on 4 November 1997 gave a verdict of unlawful killing.  Two year appeal  In April 1999, almost two years after the attack, Mrs Salvini made a plea for help to find her daughter‚Äôs killer and police stated that they believed someone was shielding him or her. The appeal led to an anonymous call stating that bolt croppers and a machete were used to cut the telephone lines on the night of Emily‚Äôs murder. The tools were never recovered.  Later developments  In 2001, Emily's murder was featured on BBC‚Äôs Crimewatch TV programme. In 2017, on the twentieth anniversary of the attack, Katie and her son Zach, 23, made a new appeal for information to find Emily‚Äôs killer. Katie described the attack again and said that she had two more children, Laurie, 16, and Sebastian, 10. She also said that she believed there were two ‚Äòvery strong suspects‚Äô who lived locally and who she had come face-to-face with in the years since the attack. She believed that one of them could have held a grudge against her for standing up for a friend. Thames Valley Police said they would be carrying out new forensic tests on fire debris retrieved from the scene of the crime.

It attempts to offer a critique of modernity which is neither antimodern nor postmodern, but proposes a rebuilt modernity based on the subject's liberation.  Summary  Touraine describes how a modernity based on the idea of reason has been questioned by various parties. Its purported universalism has been criticized for how its elite has been unable to recognize the particular experiences of groups such as the working class, the colonized, women and children. Touraine recognizes this as a problem, but rejects the acceptance of human diversity as a solution, because accepting difference would also be to accept intolerance and conflict. He also rejects postmodernism, which he simply views as an exhaustion of the same modernity. Touraine proposes a rebuilt modernity. Instead of the dualist modernity of Ren√© Descartes and the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, which has been destroyed by Friedrich Nietzsche, Sigmund Freud, consumerism and nationalism, Touraine wants to base modernity on the subject's struggle for freedom. This includes the individual's as well as the group's will to control their own lives, in opposition to the logic of market forces and power. Touraine's preferred modernity therefore recognizes the need for memory and belonging, which becomes part of a correspondence with reason and the subject's liberation. Reception Pierre Muller argued that the book lacks the necessary keys to understand the relationship between the subject- individual and the collective actor, which is crucial for the proposed new forms of mediation, as well as for any issues concerning exclusion and citizenship. Still, Muller found the book \\"extremely stimulating\\" for its \\"original contribution to the current debate on the crisis of political mediation and, more generally, on the place of the individual in sociological analysis\\", although it \\"opens more doors than it offers answers\\". Barry Cooper wrote that Touraine was a \\"master of the genre\\" of deconstruction, but that \\"those who are puzzled by opacity of argumentation and bored by repetitive, allusive language bursting with metaphors may wish not to devote their time to his text\\". Cooper thought the book led to a \\"dead end\\" which could have been used to \\"question the modern premises of modernity, to recall that modernity was in its genesis a rejection of something not modern\\", although this would collide with the author's historicist approach. Cooper wrote that \\"Touraine has provided political philosophers with a symptom of the disorders they are called upon to analyze\\". Peter Beilharz described the book as \\"a kind of summary of a life's work\\" and \\"arguably longer than it needs to be\\", and wrote that What Is Democracy? and Can We Live Together? possibly are better titles to start with for readers who are new to Touraine's work.

First run  Kyle MacDonnell starred in the 15-minute unsponsored program, which also featured the Norman Paris Trio, an instrumental combo. They were supplemented by dancing duos (Jack and Jill, April until June 1948, and Blaire and Deane, June until September 1948). The format had MacDonnell in a nightclub visiting with patrons and singing one or two songs. MacDonnell's starring role (her first on television) resulted from an NBC executive's seeing her perform on Broadway in the revue Make Mine Manhattan. John Royal, who was the network's vice- president of new developments, decided that he wanted to audition MacDonnell for TV. On an evening in 1947, NBC's New York station went on the air early so that Royal could watch an audition of MacDonnell on TV from his home, after which the station resumed transmitting a test pattern. Satisfied by the audition, Royal decided to hire her. A review of the April 15, 1948, episode in the trade publication Billboard praised MacDonnell's personality and performance but found the dancing of Jack and Jill and the comedy of Dan Henry less commendable.  Girl About Town  Securing a sponsor resulted in changes in title, format and personnel in the fall of 1948. The Bates Fabric Company, which manufactured bed linens, agreed to advertise on Girl About Town. When the show debuted on September 8, 1948, MacDonnell and the Norman Paris Trio remained from the original cast, with Johnny Downs added as MacDonnell's press agent. The locale moved from a night club set to sites around New York City where MacDonnell purportedly performed. Live performances from a set in a New York studio supplemented 16 mm film of landmarks around the city. Earl Wrightson replaced Downs by October. After six months, the program's title was changed to Around the Town. On June 11, 1949, it ended and For Your Pleasure resumed.  Second run  After Girl About Town ended, MacDonnell returned in a 30-minute version of For Your Pleasure, minus dancers. Earl Shelton and his orchestra provided music. After two months, NBC canceled the program, putting the 15-minute programs Chicago Jazz and Stud's Place in the time slot.

Early life and education Milgrim was born as Sally Knobel on April 21, 1898, to immigrant parents Philip and Tillie Knobel. She was married to Charles Milgrim in 1914, who co-operated a family suit business on the Lower East Side of New York City. Career 1940 advertisement featuring a dress by Milgrim At her husband's business, Milgrim began displaying her own dress designs to appeal to the female consumers. By 1922, her dress designs were sold across twenty- nine states and she was recruited to design clothes for Broadway productions. Milgrim eventually opened her own store on 57th Street near Fifth Avenue in 1927. Due to her popularity, Milgrim was forced to move into a larger space on Fifty-Seventh Street to sell her designs. Her building was designed by architect L. H. Friedland and the interior by the Paris Studio of New York. In 1933, Milgrim was asked to design a dress for Eleanor Roosevelt to wear to her husband's first inaugural ball. The light blue dress would later go on display at the Smithsonian Institution. Milgrim also designed dresses for Marilyn Miller, Ethel Merman, Pearl White, and Mary Pickford. In March 1936, Milgrim was honored by the New York League of Business and Professional Women for her achievements. In 1941, Milgrim unveiled a new collection called \\"Arabesque,\\" as it was inspired by their modest fashion. The clothes in this collection emphasized women's \\"tent-pole Silhouette,\\" which means she combined many styles into one. She also created a \\"ready to wear\\" clothing line labelled \\"Salymil.\\" Vogue described this label as \\"fresh young clothes.\\" Later life and legacy Milgrim retired from the fashion industry in 1960, and eventually died on June 16, 1994.

Preston is an American civil rights attorney, tenant rights activist, and member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. He is known for having founded Tenants Together, a California tenant advocacy organization. In November 2019, Preston won a special election to finish Mayor London Breed's term on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, defeating incumbent Vallie Brown to represent District 5. In November 2020, a regular election will be held for supervisor in District 5. Early life and education Preston was born in New York City. His parents were refugees from Nazi Germany during World War II. Their family lived in a co-operative apartment in Greenwich Village. Preston attended Bowdoin College, where he met his wife Jenckyn Goosby. He graduated in 1991 with a major in anthropology and economics. After graduation, the couple moved to Jenckyn's native San Francisco, settling down near Alamo Square. Preston studied law at UC Hastings College of the Law, receiving his J.D. in 1996. He was a co-owner of the bar and nightclub Cafe du Nord in the Castro District of San Francisco. Career After earning his law degree, Preston worked on police brutality cases at the firm of John Burris. He spent the late 1990s working at public interest firms. Preston joined the non-profit Tenderloin Housing Clinic in 2000 and transitioned to tenant rights law. =Tenants Together= In 2008 Preston founded Tenants Together, a non- profit organization advocating for tenant rights in California. The organization campaigned against California's Proposition 98 that year. The ballot initiative would have abolished rent control across the state but was rejected by voters. Preston spearheaded a series of tenant bootcamps across San Francisco from 2015 to 2017, teaching renters how to protect their rights. Tenants Together now supports a network of fifty tenant organizations throughout California with a hotline for renters, a network of tenant rights attorneys, and trainings for tenant organizers. =Political career= Preston at an election night campaign event in 2019 Preston ran against incumbent London Breed in the 2016 Board of Supervisors election for District 5 but lost 48% to 52%. He authored San Francisco's 2018 Proposition F, which directs the city to establish a universal right to counsel for tenants facing eviction. In July 2018, Preston, a member of the San Francisco chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), became a candidate for the 2019 District 5 Supervisor election, to fill the vacancy left when Breed became mayor. Shortly after, Breed appointed Vallie Brown to the fill the position, and Brown ran as an incumbent. Preston ran as a democratic socialist and won the election by a narrow margin, becoming the first democratic socialist elected to the board in forty years. Preston was sworn in on December 16, 2019. Preston has argued, \\"San Francisco is a shining example of the complete and utter failure of the free market address housing needs.\\" He has blamed homelessness in San Francisco on \\"unbridled capitalism.\\" He has criticized YIMBYism. In 2019, Preston opposed California Senate Bill 50, which would have eased housing construction near public transit, arguing that it was a \\"developer bill.\\" In 2019, Preston spoke against the construction of a 186-unit apartment complex because only 20% of the apartments were for affordable housing while Preston wanted 33%. Preston is a proponent of rent control. In 2020, Preston delayed a major zoning plan which would have led to the construction of thousands of housing units to the Van Ness/Market Street area of San Francisco. He called for a \\"a race and equity study\\" of the project. Personal life He is married. Preston and his wife live in a house in the Alamo Square neighborhood in San Francisco, which they bought in the 1990s. He has been on the board of the Alamo Square Neighborhood Association. In the early 2000s, he worked to stop fast-food franchises such as Burger King and Domino's Pizza from moving into Alamo Square.

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is by far the best known Helicobacter species primarily because humans infected with it may develop gastrointestinal tract diseases such as stomach inflammation, stomach ulcers, doudenal ulcers, stomach cancers of the non-lymphoma type, and various subtypes of extranodal marginal zone lymphomass, e.g. those of the stomach, small intestines, large intestines, and rectumn. H. pylori is also associated with the development of bile duct cancer and has been associated with a wide range of other diseases although its role in the development of many of these other diseases requires further study. Humans infected with H. bizzozeronii are prone to develop some of the same gastrointestinal diseases viz., stomach inflammation, stomach ulcers, duodenum ulcers, stomach cancers that are not lymphomas, and extrnodal marginal B cell lymphomas of the stomach. Other non-H. pylori Helicobacter species that are known to be associated with these gastrointestinal diseases are Helicobacter felis, Helicobacter salomonis, Helicobacter suis, and Helicobacter heilmannii s.s. Because of their disease associations, these four Helicobacter species plus H. bizzozeronii are often group together and termed Helicobacter heilmannii sensu lato. H. bizzozeronii bacteria are detected in the stomachs of their natural hosts viz., cats, dogs, foxes, and lynxes, as well as in the saliva of dogs. Reports suggest that individuals, including children, are infected with this bacterium by having close contact with these animals. That is, H. bizzozeronii-associated diseases appear to be zoonotic diseases, i.e. infectious diseases that are caused or promoted by a pathogen(s) that spreads from animals to humans. It is important to diagnose H. bizzozeronii as well as the other Helicobacter heilmannii sensu lato infections in patients with the cited upper gastrointestinal tract diseases, including in particular extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of the stomach, because some of them have been successfully treated and cured using antibiotic-based drug regimens (e.g.amoxicillin, clarithromycin, plus a proton pump inhibitor or metronidazole, clarithromycin, plus a proton pump inhibitor) directed against the instigating bacterium.

Sofronije Podgoriƒçanin was born in Podgorica in what is now Montenegro but was then part of the Ottoman Empire. He joined the monastic order as a youngster at a monastery and later, after completing his theological studies in Peƒá, was elevated through the ranks. Sofronije became an archimandrite at the Patriarchate of Peƒá and when Bishop Jovan of Papraƒáa Monastery died in 1694, he was named the monastery's administrator and exarch of Patriarch Arsenije III ƒåarnojeviƒá. With the patriarch, he migrated north to the Serbian territories, then under Austrian and Hungarian rule. After bishop Petronije Ljubibratiƒá died and his brother Janiƒáije (Ljubibratiƒá) succeeded him in the Eparchy of Slavonia,it was Sofronije Podgoriƒçanin who was named successor by Arsenije III. In 1703 the Hungarians, under the leadership of their famous Transylvanian Prince Francis II R√°k√≥czi, rebelled against the Austrians, demanding Hungarian independence from the Habsburg Monarchy. It was only then that Vienna eased the pressure on the Serbs, hoping to pacify them because of Austria's need for assistance in dealings with Hungarians. In this political game of chess between Vienna and the Serbs, no opportunities were missed by Patriarch Arsenije III to replace the Uniate Bishop of Pakrac with Bishop Sofronije Podgoriƒçanin, in 1705.The following year, Patriarch Arsenije III sent the Austrian Emperor a written request that the Serbian Orthodox church, political, economic and military rights be spared further restrictions. And so, in 1706, Emperor Joseph I (1705-1711) reconfirmed the privileges granted Serbs by Leopold I. The second Kru≈°edol sabor of 1710 in order to elect a replacement for Isaija ƒêakoviƒá who died in 1708. The newly elected Metropolitan Sofronije Podgoriƒçanin was prevented by the Austrians from giving his oath of allegiance to the Peƒá Patriarch. However, Patriarch Kalinik I (1691-1710) gave his blessings as well as an official scroll confirming the Metropolitan of Kru≈°edol, and at the same time, extended to him and his See, a form of autonomy. Despite Vienna's constant meddling in Serb affairs, the Serb Orthodox were slowly entrenching their communal organizations and settling themselves permanently. Unfortunately, the early death of Metropolitan Sofronije prompted another calling of a third assembly (sabor) in April 1713, in Sremski Karlovci. For two years again, the Church was leaderless until Vikentije Popoviƒá-Had≈æilaviƒá (1713-1725) was elected.

Early history  = Byzantine coins = Croats did not begin to create their own coins for currency until late in the 12th century (1100-1200). Previously, they minted replicas of Byzantine coins of emperor Heraclius. Byzantine coinage was adopted by Byzantine Empire in the 4th century (300-400) and was the currency standard for the empire for about 700 years = Cristatic and banovav = In 1192, Croatian Duke Herceg Andrija minted a new coinage the Croatian fristatic, which included the silver denar and half-denar. His successors, the Croatian viceroys, minted a new coinage called the banovac (banski denar) which lasted from 1260 to 1380. This currency used fine silver from the mints in current day Zagreb and Pakrac. = Republic of Dubrovnik coinage = At the start of the 15th century (1400-1500), coastal Croatia came under increasing attack by the Ottoman Empire, which wanted to take control of it from the Republic of Venice. Venice succeeded in maintaining control over the current Croatian territory except for the city-state of Dubrovnik, which became independent during this time, and minted and refined their own coinage over the span of five years. This ‚ÄúRepublic of Dubrovnik‚Äù coinage was called the artiluc. During this five-year span, other Croatian coastal towns, Zadar, ≈†ibenik, Trogir, Split and Hvar also minted their own similar coinage. = Assignats (first printed money) = Printed money was introduced into the Croatian territory in 1778 in the city of Pag. This new currency was referred to as assignats, which were also being introduced into France at the same time. Previously the city of Pag had relied on salt to pay officers, clerks and doctors. To convert salt to assignats, the salt amount was converted to a lira equivalent, which was noted on the assignats by including sum and issue date information. = Kri≈æar, forint, and banknotes = In 1848, Josip Jelaƒçiƒá was appointed Ban of Croatia, and issued a combination of coins and banknotes during his time as ruler. For smaller- scale transactions, coins called kri≈æar and forint (minted in Zagreb) were utilized. Kri≈æar were minted from copper and forint from silver. For larger transactions of enterprises, communalities, and trading houses, banknotes backed by guarantees were issued instead.  Yugoslavia  = Serbian dinar = With the creation of Yugoslavia in 1918, the Serbian dinar was adopted alongside the krone in Croatia. The Serbian dinar also became the currency of the Kingdom of Serbs and the Slovenes. These were the first banknotes that represented the Kingdom of the Serbians. In 1929, the name of the country was changed from Kingdom of the Serbs to Kingdom of Yugoslavia, and thus, the name of the currency was changed from the Serbian dinar to the Yugoslav dinar = Croatian kuna (Independent State of Croatia) = In 1929, a Croatian revolutionary movement, known as the Usta≈°a, started to form. This revolutionary movement was a Croatian, fascist, ultranationalist and terrorist organization that murdered hundreds of thousands of Serbs and Jews. In 1941 Yugoslavia allowed the radical right Usta≈°a to come into power over the territory of Croatia, which progressed the formation of the Independent State of Croatia. From 1941-1945 during WWII, Croatia was independent, and officially adopted the Kuna as the currency for the first time on July 26th,1941. The Croatian Kuna at the time of adoption included banknotes of 10, 50, 100, 500, and 1,000. Banknotes of 1, 2, were later introduced in 1942, and 5,000 banknotes were added in 1943. The Kuna started with a fixed exchange rate of 20.00 Kn (Kuna) = 1 RM (Reichsmark), the currency for Germany at the time. By May 6th 1945, the exchange rate between the Kuna and Reichsmark was fixed at 120.00 Kn (Kuna) = 1 RM (Reichsmark) = The Yugoslav dinar = In 1945, the Usta≈°a were forced to concede due to the Partisan resistance and their help from the Soviet Red Army, and the Independent State of Croatia was recaptured by Socialist Yugoslavia, and became part of a new communist system. From June 30th to July 9th, the Kuna was removed from the currency circulation and replaced by the 1944 issue of the Yugoslav Dinar. At the time of reissue, the Yugoslav Dinar had a fixed exchange rate of 40 Kn (Kuna) = 1 dinar  Croatian kuna  In 1991, Croatia officially declared its independence from the socialist Republic of Yugoslavia and became a separate country. After independence, a period of transition began from the dinar back to the kuna. The name was re-chosen as the name of the currency to represent the fiscal history of Croatia. One kuna was equivalent to 1000 dinars. The modern kuna became the official currency of Croatia in 1994 on May 30th. Currently, the Croatian kuna includes a combination of both coins and bills in the circulation. Coins are in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 50 lipa. The banknotes are in denominations of 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, and 1000 kuna. Today, the Croatian kuna has an inflation rate of 1.10%.

The station was owned and operated by Sanford Schafitz. Mounting issues with the license renewal of a co-owned radio station in Lorain, WWIZ, in which Schafitz had sold a stake to obtain capital to start WXTV, led to the station's closure. History =Allocation change and construction= The construction permit for WXTV was granted to the Community Telecasting Company in November 1955, to telecast on channel 73, and the call letters WXTV were quickly granted. Still unbuilt, the station modified its application in December 1956 to specify channel 45. The Federal Communications Commission, however, instead let channel 45 remain in the hands of WKST-TV of New Castle, Pennsylvania, which at the time was not broadcasting; the FCC denied a protest by Community against the move. The next year, it considered, then dropped, a plan to move the channel 73 allotment to Pittsburgh and substitute channel 33 for WXTV's use. Ultimately, the two stations' fight for lower channel positions was resolved by letting WKST-TV move to channel 33 (and change its city of license to Youngstown), giving WXTV permission to operate on channel 45 once it was vacated. In early 1960, an application to transfer the station's construction permit from Community Telecasting to WXTV, Inc., both owned by Sanford A. Schafitz and Guy W. Gully, was held up by the FCC when WKST-TV petitioned against the move, saying the permittees were not legally or financially qualified; while the FCC dismissed the petition as moot, it decided to look into the charges. =On the air= WXTV began regular programming on November 15, 1960 with six hours of programming, including three movies. In addition to films, WXTV aired some local programming. In January 1962, it started a children's show hosted by John \\"Dusty\\" Boyd. A local live music show titled \\"45 Hop\\" in the format of American Bandstand aired on weeknights as early as 1961, hosted by WHOT (1570 AM) personality Al DeJulio; the program later inspired a similar program on WYTV hosted by fellow WHOT personality \\"Boots\\" Bell. Having made one channel change already before going on air, WXTV tried to change positions again when it filed to move to channel 15, allocated to Ashtabula, Ohio, but WICA-TV's license was still in force. =Signing off= On February 28, 1962, WXTV did not sign on for the day; a station staffer asked by The Vindicator reported that channel 45 was having technical difficulties. The station failing to telecast for the day came just days after the FCC had ordered a hearing into all of Schafitz's broadcast holdings, which included WWIZ in Lorain and WFAR in Farrell, Pennsylvania. The FCC announced that issues to be raised in the hearing included an unauthorized transfer of control at the Lorain radio station and misrepresentations relating to Schafitz's employment at WXTV. The hearing also revealed that the unreported sale of a minority stake in WWIZ was undertaken in order to raise $55,000 in capital to build channel 45. For channel 45‚Äîwhose transfer to WXTV, Inc. was still pending‚Äîthere was an additional reason to deny WXTV its license: co-owner Gully was an indicted felon, making him unfit to hold a broadcast license. While hearing examiner Chester F. Naumowicz, Jr., found that Schafitz was unaware of Gully's indictment until after the applications were filed, his failure to provide the information still precluded granting the license. The full commission agreed and denied the license application in April 1964; at the same time, it denied the renewal of WWIZ radio's license. The channel 45 allocation remained in Youngstown in the 1965 UHF table revision. It was moved to Alliance as part of a 1971 application by the Ohio Educational TV Network Commission to build new educational TV stations at Alliance and Akron to be jointly operated by Kent State University, the University of Akron, and Youngstown State University, which went on the air as WNEO in 1973.

Life  Born in K√∂nigsberg, Jacoby studied Protestant theology there from 1900 to 1903. He acquired the licentiate degree with a text interpretation of the Biblical book of Jeremiah. After the state examination for the higher school service in religion, Hebrew and German, which he passed in 1904, he studied philosophy in East Prussia and Berlin while working as an assistant teacher and received his doctorate in 1906 under Friedrich Paulsen with the work Herders \\"Kalligone\\" und ihre Verh√§ltnis zu Kants \\"Kritik der Urteilskraft\\". Two years as an exchange teacher in Paris and Glasgow followed and in 1908 a failed habilitation attempt in M√ºnster.Christian Tilitzki: Die deutsche Universit√§tsphilosophie in der Weimarer Republik und im Dritten Reich. Part 1, Berlin Academy 2002, {, }. Finally Jacoby habilitated 1909 in Greifswald with his book Herders und Kants √Ñsthetik published two years before and based on his dissertation as well as the manuscript Die Philosophie Herders. After completing his habilitation, Jacoby became a private lecturer in philosophy at Greifswald University. Jacoby's inaugural Greifswald lecture on pragmatism resulted in a correspondence with William James, which led to an invitation as a Research Fellow at Harvard University. In 1911 he presented the work Herder als Faust, in which he attempted to demonstrate by comparing texts that Johann Wolfgang von Goethe had Johann Gottfried Herder in mind as a model for his Faust drama. After a visiting professorship at the University of Illinois and extensive lecture tours in Asia and North Africa, Jacoby served for several months as a war volunteer officer on the Western Front before he was seriously wounded and, deemed as unfit for service, dismissed with the Iron Cross second class. In 1915 the Prussian Ministry of Culture recruited lecturers for the newly founded Istanbul University, and Jacoby taught there until November 1918, \\"using the amply granted leisure time for a never published opus on Herder and the New Foundation of German Philosophy in the Second Half of the 18th Century\\".Christian Tilitzki: Die deutsche Universit√§tsphilosophie in der Weimarer Republik und im Dritten Reich. Teil 1., Berlin Akademie 2002, , After his return, Jacoby joined the West Russian Volunteer Army but soon returned to Greifswald at the beginning of the summer semester 1919. In March 1920 he took part in the leadership of a volunteer company in the Kapp Putsch against the Weimar Republic. After the rapid failure of this uprising \\"Jacoby followed old sympathies only as a voter of the DNVP and dedicated himself to his life's work, the ontology of reality\\".Christian Tilitzki: Die deutsche Universit√§tsphilosophie in der Weimarer Republik und im Dritten Reich. Teil 1., Berlin Akademie 2002, , Jacoby's appointment was rejected by the Greifswald faculty because \\"Jacoby, who oscillates between philosophy and literary history and whom one had hardly seen because of his many trips abroad, was probably not a suitable candidate for such an increase in rank.\\" A Jacoby-inspired establishment of a special professorship (Extraordinariat) for International Philosophy) in Kiel was rejected because of his lack of professional qualifications, and \\"the people of Greifswald, solely because of the 'predicament' of the homecomer from Constantinople, resisted the appointment as Extraordinarius\\". Forced to retire in 1937 during the Third Reich because of his grandfather's ancestry, Jacoby was unable to resume teaching until 1945.

Acknowledgement  Along with Nicolai Hartmann, Jacoby is considered the founder of \\"critical ontology\\", a form of critical realism directed against neo-Kantianism. Jacoby stands out from a world view through his rejection of democracy (\\"the temporary stay in 'democratic states' has 'brought down' his already weak belief in popular rule even further\\"Quoted from Christian Tilitzki: The German university philosophy in the Weimar Republic and in the Third Reich. Part 1, Berlin Academy 2002, {, ), and in 1921 he criticized in a brochure about \\"English and German mankind\\" with formulations like \\"paradise of the average humanity\\" an \\"English conformism\\" as \\"a Judaism disguised as Christian\\", to which he contrasted the freedom of German humanity\\".G√ºnther Jacoby: Englische und deutsche Mannesart. Moninger Greifswald 1921 (Deutsche Sammlung Band 1), quoted from Christian Tilitzki: Die deutsche Universit√§tsphilosophie in der Weimarer Republik und im Dritten Reich. Teil 1., Berlin Akademie 2002, , Jacoby regards logic as a purely philosophical discipline which must be strictly distinguished from modern formal-mathematical logic (still called \\"logistics\\" by him), a position which he summarized in his monograph Die Anspr√ºche der Logistiker auf die Logik und ihre GeschichtsschreibungDie Anspr√ºche der Logistiker auf die Logik und ihre Geschichtsschreibung on WorldCat published in 1962 and which his pupil Bruno von Freytag-L√∂ringhoff developed further in his succession. Jacoby considers the task of logic to be to examine the concept of \\"logical\\" - in the sense of \\"consistent\\" - for its objective backgrounds independent of the closing subject. These backgrounds do not form the conclusion itself, which he regards as subjective and bound to a psychological subject; rather, everything logical is based on a \\"subject-free objective foundation,\\" which is about \\"identities between facts\\".\\"Behind consistency stands, open or concealed, a subject-bound deductive closing. And behind this, as its subject-free, objective foundation, stand the identities between facts.\\" (The claims of the logisticians to logic and its historiography, ) To the existence or non-existence of such identities everything logical refers, that is all \\"concepts, judgments, assumptions, deductive and inductive conclusions\\".Die Anspr√ºche der Logistiker auf die Logik und ihre Geschichtsschreibung, . In particular, for Jacoby species- generic relationships, i.e. relationships between more general facts, the genus, and more specific facts, the species, are determined by a certain type of identity and non-identity. Only this is relevant for logic.\\"[Logic] works in conceptual pyramids, i.e. on identity and non-identity relationships in the sequence between more general facts as genera and more specific as species.\\" (Die Anspr√ºche der Logistiker auf die Logik und ihre Geschichtschreibung, ) Jacoby sees his understanding of logic and its field of objects, as well as his definition of identity, in stark contrast to modern formal logic, of which he also holds the opinion that it is connected to a certain epistemological position and is necessarily subject-bound.\\"[T]he logic of the second half of the 19th century, according to his subject-bound epistemological attitude, and thus proceeded, as it does today in its wake, from the judgments existing only for us.\\" (The logisticians' claims to logic and its historiography), ) For Jacoby, the judgments and conclusions are subject-bound, the concepts are subject-free objective, and since the object of logic must be the investigation of objective conditions, logic must begin at the level of concepts and not - as he sees it in modern formal logic - at the level of statements or conclusions. One consequence of this point of view is that the analysis of statements in the concept of subject and predicate (species and genus) and in the expression of their \\"identity\\", as it is carried out by traditional logic in the form of syllogistic, must be regarded as the only logically correct \\"Conceptual logic applies to identities between relations as well as between subjects and predicates. Here it subsumes subjects as species or individuals under their inherent predicates as general, their relations as species under their inherent relational genus. The subsumption is the same both times.\\" (The claims of the logisticians to logic and its historiography, and that only syllogisms are valid conclusions.\\"Non-syllogistic conclusions contradict each other.\\" (The claims of the logisticians to logic and its historiography), The realization of modern logic that many intuitively valid arguments - for example, the argument \\"All horses are animals\\" often quoted in tradition, so all horse heads are animal heads - Jacoby agrees - after such an analysis cannot be proved to be valid; in order to nevertheless be able to uphold the validity of such arguments, he assumes that the respective argument must include additional premises which are merely not explicitly quoted, that the argument is thus incompletely formulated, as is an enthymeme. Jacoby's conception of logic - he speaks of the \\"one logic\\" - is strongly distinguished from modern logic, which works with formal and mathematical methods, as it exists for example in propositional calculus, predicate logic or modal logic. Jacoby regards this as mathematical disciplines, as individual sciences, which could not claim to have the knowledge of \\"true logic\\" and which are subordinate to philosophy. That modern formal logic was nevertheless accorded such a high status by philosophy during Jacoby's lifetime, and that the recognition of his interpretation of traditional logic declined, he attributes in his work Die Anspr√ºche der Logistiker auf die Logik und ihre Geschichtschreibung (The claims of logisticians to logic and its historiography) to the fact that the representatives of modern logic are partly motivated by positivist philosophical hostility,Die Anspr√ºche der Logistiker auf die Logik und ihre Geschichtsschreibung, partly for \\"confessional motives\\"The claims of the logisticians to logic and its historiography, , there also: \\"In the historiography of logistics their propagandists are often Catholic clergymen.\\" but besides also out of \\"need for recognition\\", \\"immaturity\\"Die Anspr√ºche der Logistiker auf die Logik und ihre Geschichtschreibung, and \\"association consciousness\\" have built a global propaganda machine in order to jointly \\"as exponents of the ideology of an invisible international corporation\\" first \\"slander, then substance murder\\" commit the philosophical logic and finally take up its inheritance. Jacoby died in Greifswald at the age of 87.

The specific causes of that broad population decline are still debated. While heavily-populated settlements were regularly created, abandoned, and resettled during the Neolithic, after around 5400 years ago, a great number of those settlements were permanently abandoned. The population decline is associated with worsening agricultural conditions and a decrease in cereal production. Other suggested causes include the emergence of communicable diseases spread from animals living in close quarters with humans.  Plague  Rascovan et al (2019) suggest that plague could have also caused the population decline. That is supported by the discovery of a tomb in modern-day Sweden containing 79 corpses buried within a short time, in which the authors discovered fragments of a unique strain of the plague pathogen Yersinia pestis. The authors note that the strain contained the \\"plasminogen activator gene that is sufficient to cause pneumonic plague\\", an extremely deadly form of the plague which is airborne and directly communicable between humans. A similar site was found in China in 2011. The site Hamin Mangha in northeast China dates back to approximately 5000 years ago and features a small structure filled with almost 100 bodies. This could mean the location faced an outbreak that surpassed what the village could handle. Two other sites like these have been found in Northeast China: Miaozigou and Laijia. Conditions for the population increase that preceded that decline are generally ascribed to rapid population growth between 5950 and 5550 BP. That growth was catalysed by the introduction of agriculture, along with the spread of technologies such as pottery, the wheel, and animal husbandry. Following the Neolithic decline were massive human migrations from the Eurasian Steppe into eastern and central Europe, in approximately 4600 BP.

Development and announcement On June 15, 2018, Apple announced a multiyear partnership with Winfrey, saying she would work on projects to be \\"released as part of a lineup of original content from Apple.\\". On March 25, 2019 Apple hosted keynote event at its California campus to announce the new Apple TV+ subscription service. Winfrey appeared onstage to conclude the event, announcing that she would be producing two documentary series, as well launching a \\"book club\\" in partnership with Apple. During her announcement, Winfrey indicated the book club project may include a simulcast element at Apple's retail locations \\"where Apple Stores stream a conversation with the author and me live across all devices, across all borders\\". On September 23, 2019 in a press release, Apple announced the series would be titled Oprah's Book Club, would stream exclusively on Apple TV+, and would premiere with the streaming service's launch on November 1, 2019. Premise The series is a standalone spinoff of the popular Oprah's Book Club segment of The Oprah Winfrey Show, begun in 1996 and marks its first return to the television medium since the 2011 conclusion of Winfrey's television show. It is also a successor to Oprah's Book Club 2.0, a non-televised and irregularly- released online iteration of the reading series launched in 2012. Episodes are released every two months, with each episode focused on a single book and featuring an interview between Winfrey and the book's author. Episodes are filmed at various locations. Each episode's book pick is announced at the end of the previous episode, as well as a dedicated section on Apple Books and on Oprah's website. Episodes are typically filmed in front of a live audience and feature an interview between Winfrey and the selected book's author. Merchandising and tie-ins Along with the announcement of the show, Apple announced that Oprah's Book Club would integrate with Apple Books by allowing users of the e-reading application to be alerted of new picks, and that Apple would make an unspecified contribution to the American Library Association for each Oprah Book Club selection sold via Apple Books. As with the two previous iterations of the Club, the selection of a book by Winfrey typically results in the publication of an \\"Oprah edition\\", often with a branded \\"Oprah's Book Club\\" seal on the book's cover. Winfrey's September 2019 pick of The Water Dancer by Ta-Nehisi Coates marked the first time in the Oprah Book Club's three iterations a book had been selected as a pick prior to its publication (in this case, one day prior).

According to the Internet Exchange Report by Hurricane Electric Internet Services, DATAIX is the largest in Russia and is one of the five largest in the world by peak traffic, the size of which exceeds 3 Tbit/s. The headquarters of the company is located in St. Petersburg.  History  DATAIX was launched in St. Petersburg in 2009. The first Internet exchange point was located in the Information Exchange Center in the building of the Saint Petersburg State University of Industrial Technologies and Design (18 Bolshaya Morskaya Street). The founders used their own money as investment. At the start, DATAIX purchased part of the fiber- optic network, and partly built it specifically for the project (for example, the route from the data centers on Tsvetochnaya Street, where VKontakte was hosted, to Borovaya Street). Also, they leased or purchased capacities in Moscow. Peering LLC, which owned the DATAIX network, was closely connected to the relatives of Pavel Durov: half-brother Mikhail Petrov, who worked at Selectel, and his mother Albina Durova (the latter owned 25.5% of the company from July 2012 to November 2013). In 2013, a DATAIX point of presence was opened in Kyiv. DATAIX served the Ukrainian traffic of the VKontakte social network, with caching servers of the social network on the site. In the following years, DATAIX became a major player in the Ukrainian traffic market. In 2016, the largest telecommunications companies of the country Kyivstar and Ukrtelecom were connected to the DATAIX exchange point, and at that time up to 2 Tbit/s of traffic passed through it. In 2015, the national operator of Moldova Moldtelecom was connected, becoming the fourth in the group of connected national operators (Ukrtelecom, Kazakhtelecom, and the National Traffic Exchange Center of Belarus). In the same year, Novatel, a member of Deutsche Telekom, joined the DATAIX network through a point in Frankfurt. In 2016 DATAIX participants got the opportunity to establish a direct session with Hurricane Electric, the largest operator in the world in terms of the number of IPv4 and IPv6 prefixes. The maximum network load in 2016 was 2.2 Tbit/s, the channel capacity between Moscow and St. Petersburg reached 0.4 Tbit/s. In 2017, DATAIX officially entered the Euro-IX Internet exchange association, and also launched points of presence in Sweden (Stockholm) and Latvia (Riga). In March 2018, it was announced that Global-IX and DATAIX are merging under the brand of the latter, but on the base of the GlobalNet infrastructure, which includes its own highway communication networks on the Moscow-St. Petersburg-Helsinki-Stockholm route. Companies are counting on the synergy effect of the GlobalNet MPLS network and the DATAIX traffic exchange point services.  Network features  DATAIX connects the traffic of telecom operators and content generators in Russia, Europe and Asia. More than 30 points of presence in a united traffic exchange network are located in seven countries: * Russia: St. Petersburg, Moscow, Samara, Ufa, Yekaterinburg, Chelyabinsk; * Ukraine: Kyiv, Kharkiv, Odessa; * Kazakhstan: Nur-Sultan; * Germany: Frankfurt; * Sweden: Stockholm; * Finland: Helsinki, Espoo; * Netherlands: Amsterdam. The total length of the networks is more than 7 thousand km, and the total throughput capacity of external channels reaches 3 Tbit/s. The number of participants (ASN) exceeds 400, of which 80% are telecom operators and 20% are content generators. Peak load of communication channels exceeded 3 Tbit/s, while before the merger it did not exceed 2 Tbit/s. According to the results of 2018, the total number of ports in the DATAIX network is 3403, of which 247 are ports with throughput capacity of 100 Gbit/s (0.1 Tbit/s) each, 123 ports with capacity of 40 Gbit/s and 2930 ports of 10 Gbit/s. As of September 2019, DATAIX is ahead of the Russian network MSK-IX in terms of the number of participants.  Events  DATAIX regularly takes part in meetings of the Internet exchange association Euro-IX, at GPF conferences (Global Peering Forum), EPF (European Peering Forum), ENOG (Eurasia Network Operators Group). The company also hosted the first large-scale conference for the telecom market in St. Petersburg ‚Äî GlobalNet Telecom Day 2019.  Owners and management  DATAIX is owned by GlobalNet. GlobalNet CEO is Natalya Lukina.

The firehouse was originally built in 1932 for Engine Company 261 and Ladder Company 116. Engine Company 261 was established in 1894 as Long Island City Fire Department's Engine Company 3, and was renumbered in 1913. Engine Company 261 served both Long Island City and the nearby community of Roosevelt Island until 2003, until it was closed as a cost-saving measure, while Ladder Company 116 still operates out of the firehouse. Fire officials, local residents, and business owners have argued that the engine company should be re-opened.  Building  Construction of the present firehouse at 29th Street started in the 1930s. After the foundation was completed, work was halted by early 1932 because the New York City Comptroller, Charles W. Berry, had failed to allocate funds for construction. Berry approved construction contracts for the firehouse in late March 1932. The building opened in November 1932 and was the first firehouse in Queens with its own water tower. Upon the opening of the 29th Street firehouse, Engine Co. 261 and Ladder Co. 116 vacated their former headquarters at 38-08 28th Street, one block away.  Engine Company 261  Engine Company 261 was established as Long Island City Fire Department's Engine Company 3 in 1894. It was renumbered after Long Island City was annexed by New York City in 1913. In 2003, Engine Company 261 was closed as a cost-saving measure. The closure was one of six announced by Michael Bloomberg, on May 26, 2003. At the time of its closure it had served both Long Island City and nearby Roosevelt Island. The New York Times noted how residents who lived near the closed stations expressed various degrees of distress, with some other closures triggering greater distress. In June 2017, New York City Council member Jimmy Van Bramer and local residents started to advocate for Engine Company 261's reopening, citing large population growth in Long Island City. Representatives of the Fire Fighter's Association said that the population of the station's service area had grown from 60,000 when it was closed to 200,000 in 2015. Efforts to reopen the engine company increased in late 2018 and early 2019, after Amazon had announced that it had chosen a site near the station to house their massive new headquarters, Amazon HQ2. Assemblywoman Catherine Nolan pointed out that when mayor Bill de Blasio was a city councilman, he had also argued for reopening the station. Other advocates of Engine Company 261's reinstatement included U.S. representative Carolyn Maloney, whose 12th congressional district included Roosevelt Island and Long Island City. However, plans for reopening the engine company were postponed in mid-2019 after the cancellation of the New York City campus of Amazon HQ2.  Ladder Company 116  Ladder Company 116 still operates within the firehouse. The difference between the two companies is that the ladder company focuses on rescuing occupants of buildings on fire, while the engine companies focus on actually fighting fire.

Bert McDonald, their other brother, was the boyfriend of Forty Elephants leader Alice Diamond. Wag and Wal were close friends with Birmingham Boys leader Billy Kimber, their gangs allied and both warring with Charles Darby Sabini, who eventually removed their gang from London. In about 1927, Wag‚Äôs brother, Bert, and Billy Kimber also went to America after they had fired shots through the door of the ‚ÄòGriffin‚Äô, a drinking club used by the Sabinis. Wag McDonald fled to Canada to avoid arrest after the Epsom Road Battle in 1921. From there he moved to Los Angeles, where he became a bodyguard to Charlie Chaplin and later to Jack Dragna, the city‚Äôs Mafia boss. The McDonald brothers were prominent leaders of the Elephant and Castle gang between the two World Wars. Charles (Wag) McDonald was born on February 5, 1877 at Valentine Place, Lambeth, southeast London. He became leader of the Elephant gang after discharge from the army in 1918 when he set up a string of illegal street bookmaking pitches across south London and the West End, particularly Soho, where he came in to conflict with the West End Boys led by Matt and Mike McCausland. The McCauslands were driven out of the West End in a series of street battles and later joined Alf White‚Äôs King‚Äôs Cross gang. Wag was a close friend of Birmingham racecourse gangster Billy Kimber, who had lived with the McDonald family in York Street, Lambeth, in the 1910s. When racecourses re- opened after World War I, Kimber came into conflict with East London gangsters led by Dodger Mullins and central London gangs led by Darby Sabini, Alf Solomon and Alf White, who wanted a share of lucrative pickings gained by forcing race cards and unnecessary services on bookmakers, including the sale of pitches and stools to stand on. When Darby Sabini formed an alliance with Alf Solomon‚Äôs gang and Alf White‚Äôs King‚Äôs Cross gang, Kimber responded by forming a powerful alliance between his Birmingham gang, the Elephant and Castle gang, George (Brummie) Sage‚Äôs Camden Town gang and Freddie Gilbert‚Äôs Finsbury Boys. The result was a series of battles on racecourses, in the streets, and in London‚Äôs night clubs for protection rights. The fighting continued into the 1930s when racecourses became better regulated. When the Birmingham gang, on an occasion led by Wag McDonald, ambushed and battered a coach full of Leeds bookmakers, who had lent their support to Darby Sabini, resulted in the gaoling of many of Kimber‚Äôs gang, Wag fled to Canada to escape arrest, travelling to Los Angeles, where he set up an agency to protect and escort movie stars. Wag became personal bodyguard to Charlie Chaplin. Later, he became chief minder to Los Angeles Mafia boss, Jack Dragna. That story is recounted from his diaries in ‚ÄòElephant Boys ‚Äì Tales of London and Los Angeles Underworlds‚Äô, written by his nephew Brian McDonald. In Wag‚Äôs absence, leadership of the Elephant Gang went to Walter (Wal) McDonald, who defeated the Sabini gang, led by Harry Sabini, at the ‚Äòbattle of Ham Yard‚Äô near Piccadilly in 1927 Wal was born on January 1, 1883, in Lambeth, and continued as leader until Wag returned from the United States after killing the man who had murdered his brother, Bert, in the gang wars that beset Dragna‚Äôs gang. Bert had fled to America with Billy Kimber to join up with Wag after they had fired shots at Sabini gangsters. Kimber returned to London after killing a man in Phoenix, Arizona, in a fight over a gambling debt. Albert (Bert) McDonald was born in 1889, he often led the fighting arm of the Elephant gang and had a reputation as a troublesome fellow, always looking for a fight. He had been a short-term boyfriend of Alice Diamond, who had followed Mary 'Polly' Carr as Queen of the Forty Thieves, renamed by Bert as the Forty Elephants, because of their close connection to the Elephant and Castle district of southeast London. He was murdered in Los Angeles in September 1929. Ada McDonald, sister of the McDonald boys, became a premier receiver of stolen goods. According to Detective Superintendent George Cornish of Scotland Yard, she provided services for five major London gangs, including the Forty Elephants. She specialised in fencing expensive furs for remodelling by East End tailors. She was never convicted and died in 1967. Another brother, Arthur James (Jim) McDonald, supported his brothers in their battles and later worked for Soho gang leader Jack Spot. Jim McDonald was the father of author Brian McDonald, who uncovered the histories of the Elephant and Forty Elephants gangs and brought to public attention largely forgotten gangsters such as Billy Kimber, Darby Sabini, Alf Solomon, Alf White, Johnny Phillips, Freddie Gilbert, George (Brummie) Sage, Dodger Mullins and Tommy Benneworth. Wag and Wal McDonald died within the same month of October 1940 and were buried in Streatham Cemetery.

In 1839, there were three lodges of bookbinders in London, and they undertook a thirty-week strike to limit the number of apprentices being taken on. This was broadly successful, as the masters agreed to recognise the workers' right to unionise, and some limits were placed on future numbers of apprentices. Thomas Dunning emerged as the leading figure in the London bookbinders, and he used the prestige of the successful strike to convince the national Bookbinders' Consolidated Relief Fund to reorganise as a more centralised organisation, the Bookbinders' Consolidated Union. He also convinced the three London lodges of bookbinders to merge, with the plan of taking over the management of the union, but after they did so, they found that the Consolidated Union's finances were in a worse state than expected, and so the London Consolidated Lodge instead became a separate union. While the Consolidated Union continued to represent bookbinders outside London, Dunning steadfastly refused all proposals to merge the London Consolidated Lodge into it. He remained secretary of the lodge until 1873, when he was severely injured by being hit by a vehicle, and continued to edit the union's journal, the Circular, until his death in 1875. In later years, the union became known as the London Consolidated Society of Journeymen Bookbinders. It supported the eight-hour movement, and was a founding member of the Printing and Kindred Trades Federation. On 1 January 1911, it finally merged with the Bookbinders' and Machine Rulers' Consolidated Union, the Society of Day-working Bookbinders of London and the Vellum (Account Book) Binders' Trade Society, to form the National Union of Bookbinders and Machine Rulers.

Family background  Ralph Josselyn was the son of Jeffrey Josselyn of Hide Hall in Sawbridgeworth, Hertfordshire, by his wife Katherine Bray.\\"The New England Historical and Genealogical Register\\", pg. 239-240 His eldest brother, Thomas Josselyn, was the ancestor of the Earls of Roden.\\"Notes on the aldermen, 1240-1500\\"  Career  As Josselyn's elder brother inherited their father's lands on his death, he went to make his career in London. He became a member of the Worshipful Company of Drapers, of which he would become the Master in 1457-8. He became an alderman, of Cornhill Ward, in 1456.\\"Aldermen of the City of London: Cornhill Ward\\" In 1458 he was elected one of the Sheriffs of the City of London. In 1464 he was elected to the first of his two mayoral terms. During this term, he was one of four London citizens made a Knight of the Bath, at the coronation of Edward IV's queen, Elizabeth Woodville.Sharpe, Reginald R., \\"London and the Kingdom\\", pg. 307 After his first mayoral term, Josselyn continued to be active in the city's affairs. He was elected to Parliament, representing the City of London, in 1467.\\"Aldermen in Parliament\\" In 1471, he raised a force to repel the assault of Thomas Neville, Bastard of Fauconbridge, when the latter attacked the city in an unsuccessful attempt to rescue the imprisoned King Henry VI from the Tower of London.\\"The Spectator, Vol. 39\\", pg. 717 Josselyn was elected to a second term as mayor in 1476. During this term, he initiated a huge effort to repair the city's walls, which had fallen into grave disrepair. He procured massive quantities of bricks and lime, levied taxes to pay for the significant costs of the repairs, and provided for the work to be supervised by a hand-picked panel of citizens representing each of the city's wards.\\"The Development of the Post of City Architect and Planning Officer, 1478-1954\\" He also took measures to curb the abuses of bakers and victuallers within the city.  Personal life  Josselyn seems to have married three times. His first wife, Margery, may have been either the daughter or the widow of another draper, Thomas Aylesby. His second wife, Philippa, was the daughter of Philip Malpas, another London alderman and (unlike Josselyn) a staunch Lancastrian; her sister married Thomas Cooke, another mayor of London. His third wife was Elizabeth Barley, daughter of William Barley and sister of Henry Barley, MP for Hertfordshire; she survived him and married Sir Robert Clifford, son of Thomas Clifford, 8th Baron Clifford.Breverton, Terry, \\"Henry VII: The Maligned Tudor King\\" She and her new husband were sued by her father over ownership of a manor in Linslade, previously owned by Josselyn.\\"Linslade Manors\\" Josselyn died on 25 October 1478 and was buried at St Swithin's Church in London, of which he had been a benefactor; a memorial erected to him in Sawbridgeworth church has caused some authors to state he was buried there. He seems to have had no surviving children, as his heir was his nephew George Josselyn, son of his elder brother Thomas.  Literary representation  Josselyn appears in the Elizabethan playwright Thomas Heywood's Edward IV. In the play, Josselyn is portrayed as a comic, buffoonish character, quite at odds with historical reality.Rowland, Richard, \\"Thomas Heywood's Theatre, 1599-1639: Locations, Translations, and Conflict\\", pg. 45  References  Category:1478 deaths Category:Sheriffs of the City of London Category:English MPs 1467 Category:Members of the Parliament of England for the City of London Category:15th-century lord mayors of London ","title":"Ralph Josselyn"},{"id":"62334502","title":"Make It to Heaven"},{"id":"62334503","text":"Alliance for Brazil (, ALIAN√áA) is a Brazilian political group that aims to become a political party.

After a meeting in Pal√°cio do Planalto with PSL lawmakers, Bolsonaro notified them of his resignation from the party and discussed ways to create a new one, but the President still didn't formalize his de-affiliation from PSL at that time. After the meeting, however, Bolsonaro published a message in his social media, stating that \\"today [12 November] I announced my resignation from PSL and beginning of creation of a new party: Alliance for Brazil\\", thanking \\"everyone who collaborated with me in PSL and who were partners in the 2018 elections\\". In the weeks before the announcement of the party creation, Bolsonaro had many misunderstandings with PSL president Luciano Bivar, which triggered an internal crisis. In October 2019, Bolsonaro stated to a supporter to \\"forget\\" the party, saying that Bivar was \\"doomed\\". According to Bolsonaro, the Alliance for Brazil is a \\"conservative party, that respects all religions, backs family values, supports the right to self-defense, the right to possess a firearm, free-trade with the whole world, without any ideological agenda.\\" The Brazilian media, however, has labeled Bolsonaro's new party as a far-right populist movement.

Based on the Ferrari Portofino, the car is a high performance coupe model placed between the Portofino and the F8 Tributo in Ferrari's range of sports cars. The Roma is named in honour of Italy's capital city of Rome and was unveiled online in November 2019. Official public unveil of the car took place at an event organised by Ferrari in Rome.  Design  The Roma's design language is intended to showcase the \\"pleasurable way of life\\" (called La Nuova Dolce Vita in Italian) which graced Italy's capital in the 1950s and 60s and is a departure from the styling language of current Ferrari sports cars. The front of the car draws inspiration from the SF90 Stradale flagship sports car while the side profile of the car is reminiscent of the 812 Superfast. The overall design is inspired by the 250 GT Lusso and the 250 GT 2+2 grand tourers. A body coloured grille, flush door handles, slim LED lights at the front and rear and a deep chin spoiler are some of the major changes. Rear view The interior is focused on the dual cockpit theme, featuring separate driver and passenger cells and is described as a \\"2+\\" interior by Ferrari. The dashboard features digital instrumentation (a 16.0-inch wrap-around touch screen) and a multi-function steering wheel (both shared with the SF90 Stradale) for the driver. The trim piece running through the centre of the interior separates the driver and the passenger and integrated seamlessly into the dashboard. A centrally mounted 8.4-inch portrait touch screen controls most of the car's functions and a third vertical touchscreen is integrated into the dashboard on the passenger side. The passenger display allows the passenger access to the HVAC controls alone with multimedia and navigation controls. The passenger can also view the performance metrics of the car. A newly designed key allows the driver to open the doors of the car by the push of a button near the flush door handles of the car.  Specifications and performance  The engine is the same unit used in the Portofino but is modified to be rated at between 5,750 and 7,500 rpm and of torque between 3,000 and 5,750 rpm. The twin-turbocharged V8 unit is mated to an 8-speed dual-clutch transmission shared with the SF90 Stradale which weighs less than the 7-speed unit used in the Portofino and is claimed to provide quicker and smoother shifts. A redesigned exhaust system uses particulate filters for emissions regulation reasons but it has been worked out to retain the best exhaust note. This was achieved by removing the silencers and adding bypass valves. The Roma also comes with Ferrari's side- slip control 6.0 technology, the Manettino dial with five positions on the steering wheel and a Dynamic Enhancer which controls yaw angle by actuating the individual brake calipers of the car, a first for a Ferrari GT model. Lighter components are used wherever possible and Ferrari claims that 70 percent of the parts used on the Roma are new as compared to the Portofino. An active rear wing activates in three deployment stages at high speed to help aid in generating downforce. The tyres used on the Roma measure 285/35 ZR20s at the rear and 245/35 ZR20s at the front. The Roma comes with 12-cubic feet of boot space in the trunk and additional storage space behind the two front seats. Some driver assistance systems will be optional to aid the driver during long drives. The Roma weighs less than the Portofino while being based on the same platform due to a more rigid body structure and due to the usage of lighter parts. With lightweight options, the car's dry weight is . Performance figures include a 0- acceleration time of 3.4 seconds, 0- acceleration time of 9.3 seconds and a top speed of .

Besteman, the Francis F. Bartlett and Ruth K. Bartlett Professor of Anthropology at Colby College in Waterville, Maine.  Background  While working on field research for her doctoral dissertation Besteman was in regular contact with people living in a Somalian farming village in the Jubba Valley, but lost contact due to civil war and unrest in the country once she returned home. Some Somali Bantu fled the country and resided in refugee camps in Kenya for over a decade. Upon discovering that some of the Bantu valley community had resettled in Lewiston, Maine after leaving the refugee camps, Besteman chose to write Making Refuge in order to provide a platform for them to discuss their journey of becoming resettled refugees along with their struggles to find work and getting an education in a new country where they were seen as a ‚Äúburden‚Äù by some Americans.  Synopsis  Making Refuge is separated into three parts which represent different phases of Bantu refugee‚Äôs experience and including Bestemen‚Äôs own engagement with those experiences. Bestemen pieces their movement from living south of the Jabba Valley, to living in refugee camps in Kenya for over a decade and resettling in Lewiston, Maine. Bestemen wanted to know how people had survived the civil war, losing everything that they had, enduring abuses and trauma all while attempting to rebuild their lives in a country where it is known for its individualism.  Reception  Making Refuge has been reviewed in outlets and journals such as The Journal of Social Encounters and PoLAR, the latter of which stated that it was \\"an excellent book for prompting them to think about these issues and their broader, ongoing ramifications, many of which are closer to home than they may realize.\\" Writing for Anthropological Quarterly, Cindy Horst noted that the book had several strengths such as Bestemen's prior interactions with the Bantu refugees and the different perspectives on their arrival in the United States.

The slogan soon became a catchphrase in Indonesia that helped fight the notion that voting against Islamic parties was sinful for Muslims.Nader Hashemi, Islam, secularism, and liberal democracy (Oxford University Press, USA, March 11, 2009) p. 163 Background In the 1950s, Islamic parties in Indonesia propagated the view that Muslims should vote only for ‚Äòpartai Islam‚Äô. Many Muslim clerics joined the race underlining an approach that disseminated the idea that Islamic votes were related to voters‚Äô \\"afterlife in heaven.\\" It was against this background that the prominent Muslim scholar Nurcholish Madjid launched the slogan ‚ÄùIslam yes, Islamic party no\\" in the 1970s. The slogan became very popular and eventually enabled Muslim voters to dissociate their religion from their political orientation. Muslims in Indonesia have since become more comfortable in choosing secular parties. Theoretical indications Upholding the view that there was nothing sacred about the affair of an Islamic state, Islamic party or an Islamic ideology, Madjid held that Muslims therefore should not be blamed for secularisation of their perceptions of these worldly issues.Abdullahi Ahmed An-Na'im, Islam and the secular state (Harvard University Press, Jun 30, 2009) p. 254 He criticized the idea of joining human organisations, i.e., political parties, to God which claim divine sanction for their petty interests. He argued that political parties that were exploiting the name of Islam by equating human agenda with the will of God were idolatrous. He maintained that Islam and Islamic parties are not identical to each other, because Islam cannot be reduced to a mere political ideology. In Madjid's view, identifying Islam and Islamic parties is not only wrong, it is also dangerous. Because if one day, and this has already happened, the politicians from Islamic parties commit heinous acts, then Islam as a religion can be seen to be blameworthy. Likewise, if an Islamic party loses, then Islam will be seen to lose. In this context, realising the fallacies of Islamising the political system, Madjid introduced the slogan as a form of criticism of some Islamic societies who made Islamic parties legitimate and sacred in the eyes of Indonesian people. Political impact The view conveyed by Madjid almost coincided with the 1971 election moment. Whether by chance or not, Madjid's view seemed to be in line with what was in the minds of the people. This can be seen from the reflection of people's choice in the 1971 election. Election results show that Islamic parties suffered a crushing defeat. This also became the end of the long journey of Islamic parties since 1955. On the contrary, this was the beginning of the renewal of Islam in Indonesia. The tagline thus played an important role, at a time when political Islam was already experiencing a setback, in reshaping Islam as a spiritual, cultural and intellectual force in the nation which emphasized more on moral and ethical principles rather than formal and legal aspirations. Criticism Unsurprising in this case, many Islamic party leaders accused him of ‚Äòbetraying‚Äô the cause of Islam. Modern- day relevance Dawam Rahardjo, a prominent Muslim thinker from Indonesia, believed that the slogan put forward by Madjid in 1970 was motivated by problems surrounding Islam and political affiliation of Muslims at that time. It was because Islamic parties representing the Muslim community in the political arena at that time were not yet able to present Islam as an authoritative political movement. Some others have echoed the same view outlining that Madjid opposed political Islam because he saw the condition of Islamic parties which was not yet aspirational and because Islamic parties could not still properly 'ground' the language of religion into the plurality of Indonesian society. Many religious leaders in Indonesia, however, still believe that thoughts of Madjid and his famous jargon are still relevant to modern-day situation.

She taught home economics at Japan Women's University and served as the first woman president of the school from 1931‚Äì1946. Active in the peace movement she led the Japanese affiliate of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom and was one of the leading feminists supporting internationalism in the interwar era. In the 1930s she changed her focus to Pan-Asian cooperation and at the end of the decade was appointed to the Ministry of Greater East Asia to work on educational reforms. In the 1940s, she was decorated by the Emperor of Japan but lost her presidency at Japan Women's University in 1946 when she was purged by the U. S. Occupation Administration. She remained involved in education until the mid-1950s. Early life Hideko Inoue was born on 6 January 1875 in Kasuga, Hy≈çgo Prefecture, Japan to Kahei Inoue. Her family was very affluent and influential. Upon completing elementary school, she entered the Hikami Senior School in Kashihara in 1885, and was one of only three girls in the school. One of her teachers there, Makiko Imai, encouraged Inoue to continue her education, but her father felt that she had had adequate education for a girl. With her grandmother's encouragement, he finally allowed her in 1890 to begin attending the , the oldest girls' high school in Japan. As her English scores were poor, Inoue began studying English to prepare, taking both formal classes and private instruction. One of the other students at the school was Kameko Hirooka, daughter of the founder of Japan Women's University, Asako Hirooka and she became close to the family. Masaji Inoue In 1895, Inoue married , who was adopted by the Inoue family and took the name of Masaji Inoue, as there were no sons in the family to carry on the family name. After giving birth to her oldest daughter, Shina in 1899 or 1900, Inoue enrolled in 1901 at Japan Women's University to study home economics. When she graduated, she became the secretary general of alumni association and then with the encouragement of Hirooka went to the United States to further her education at Teachers College, Columbia University and the Chicago Normal School. Career In 1908, when she returned from the United States, Inoue worked as a professor at the Japan Women's University and helped establish, along with , the field of home economics in Japan. In 1911 she became the head of the Japan Women's Peace Association, an affiliate of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom. In 1913, through her involvement with the alumni association, Inoue proposed that the graduates hold fundraisers to support a day care system modeled on those she had seen in the United States. The association held music performances and sold items at a bazaar to pay for the operation of the first day care center in Japan, which opened that year in the Sugamo neighborhood of Tokyo. She also founded the Women's Association for the Cultivation of International Friendship to urge women's cooperation globally. By the 1920s, Inoue was the leading woman in the internationalist movement and was a visible supporter of world peace. As the head of the Japanese Women's Peace League, she attended the Women's World Conference on Arms Limitation, in Washington, D. C. in 1921. She was by that time, head of the home economics department, and traveled to the conference with her secretary, Dr. Marian Irwin, graduate of Bryn Mawr College. At the conference, she spoke on the need for women's education and political rights, as well as for arms control and international peace policies. She believed that if Japan agreed with disarmament policies that would make Japanese immigration more attractive in the United States and lessen the overcrowding at home. She was also the lead delegate to the 1928 Pan-Pacific Women's Conference. In 1931, she became the first woman president of the Japan Women's University and in 1933 helped organize the International Women's and Children Exposition. In the interwar period Inoue and her husband both supported internationalism, but at the dawn of World War II, they both supported Japan's expansionism and a Pan-Asian focus under Japanese leadership. After the Second Sino-Japanese War, Inoue shifted towards pro-Asian policies and in 1937, when touring Nazi Germany, was a vocal supporter of the Nazi's Strength Through Joy program. That same year, when touring the United States she was struck by the hypocrisy of immigration bans because there was a surplus of undeveloped land. When she returned from abroad, she worked in the Ministry of Greater East Asia on educational reforms. Her lectures of the time showed she had not completely abandoned internationalism, as she argued that rationing foreign edibles which had become staples of the culture would be problematic. She also continued to press for reforms for women's education, believing that even within the cultural context of women's subservience, education was needed to advance societal modernization. In 1939, Inoue, along with other leading women like Kiuchi Kyo and Yoshioka Yayoi, established the women‚Äôs wing of the National Language Association, an organization designed to improve and preserve the Japanese language. The goal of the women's wing was to promote the use of feminine language to embody their gender in their courteous demeanor and speech. In 1940, Inoue was one of four women appointed to serve in the National Spiritual Mobilization Movement. She was decorated by the Emperor of Japan and held many varied government posts until the war ended. In 1946, Inoue was purged by the U. S. Occupation Administration from her presidency at the Japan Women's University. Ostensibly, her removal was based on an affiliation with the Imperial Rule Assistance Association because in 1941 she was appointed as the vice president of the Dai Nippon Seishonen-dan, (Greater Japan Youth and Child Group). This group was made of up school administrators for the purpose of creating activities for youth participation in the war effort. They organized such events as aid to soldiers' families, crop harvests, savings drives, and training for home and national defense. Inoue's defense of her actions was that she had opposed both her appointment to the Youth and Child Group and its affiliation with the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, but she became one of the few women purged in the period of occupation. In 1954, she accompanied Dr. Hiro Ohashi on a study tour of the social services and home economics departments of Indiana University, Iowa State College, Michigan State University, and the University of Chicago, among others. They took ideas regarding integrating physical sciences into the home economics courses, updating appliances, and adding audio-visual materials home to add to the curricula of the Women's University. Death and legacy Inoue died on 19 July 1963. There is a carved bust of Inoue on display at the Funagi Elementary School in Tanba.

He has since worked as an independent consultant and media strategist for a variety of publishers and organizations. At Pacific Standard, he argued for radical transparency around editorial decisions in newsrooms and promoted the importance of strong relationships with freelance writers, leading the magazine to be named one of the best places to pitch story ideas. As editor-in-chief, he was also publicly celebrated for developing remote working policies for staff journalism jobs, paying writers fairly and quickly, and \\"cultivating stories that inform and change people's lives.\\" When the magazine closed, it was written that Jackson \\"led a superb editorial team over his six years there\\" and that Pacific Standard \\"stood out from the pack of click-hungry websites.\\" Lloyd Grove, of The Daily Beast, reported that the shutdown \\"hit the journalism community especially hard,\\" with other journalists noting that \\"I've looked to Pacific Standard so many times for examples of great, clear-eyed reporting and elegant (but never over-the-top) writing\\" and that \\"Pacific Standard was the best dedicated source for social science coverage anywhere, and routinely put out stories that made me burn with jealousy that I didn't think of them first or do them as well.

Eight years later, he was profiled in Medill's alumni magazine in 2017 as an editor focused on accountability journalism in the public interest.  Career  After two years as the digital director and associate publisher overseeing business development and online audience growth, Jackson was appointed the third editor-in-chief of Pacific Standard. During his tenure as editor, the magazine earned numerous awards and industry accolades, including journalism's highest honor, a National Magazine Award.

His interests spanned around the following ‚Äì heat, sound, light and environmental phenomena. John Tyndall is best known for the explanation of why the sky is blue. retrieved 2019-11-14 This is known as the Tyndall Effect. When sunlight passes through the atmosphere the light is scattered by small particles suspended in the atmosphere. The blue light that we see is known as Tyndall Blue. retrieved 2019-11-14 John Tyndall developed a practical demonstration of the propagation of light though a tube of water via multiple internal reflections. This he referred to as the light-pipe, which was a forerunner of the optical fibre used in modern communications technology. retrieved 2019-11-14 Tyndall was founded in the complex of buildings known as the ‚ÄúLee Maltings‚Äù, Cork, Ireland. The site was first developed as a flour mill in 1787. The Lee Mill was the largest water-powered flour and corn milling installation at the time on the River Lee. retrieved 2019-11-14 In 1797, just 10 years later, the mill became The River Lee Porter Brewery. The brewery operated until 1813, where it was taken over by Beamish & Crawford (B&C;). The Lee Maltings was bought by University College Cork in 1968 and converted to laboratories. In 1979 a silicon wafer-fabrication laboratory was established to provide R&D; and specialised training facilities for the semi-conductor manufacturing industry. The National Microelectronics Research Centre (NMRC) was established in 1981. retrieved 2019-11-14 Infrastructure Tyndall research facilities occupy six floors, including basement, laboratory, plant and open atrium space totaling c.5,600m2 in area.https://www.tyndall.ie/facility-description Tyndall.ie retrieved 2/10/2019 The existing site comprises the Lee-Maltings Complex and some UCC teaching facilities. The site is a protected structure and consists of a number of buildings of varying age. The complex is bounded on its north side by the River Lee, on the west side by the Presentation College and on its south and east sides by Dyke Parade and Prospect Row. The form of the Research Building stems primarily from its scientific and servicing requirements, as well as its relationship to the existing buildings and site. Three floors of flexible laboratory space were built over a tall ground floor and basement, which contains the specialist clean room areas. Research As the national institute for micro/nanoelectronics and photonics, and a research flagship of University College Cork, Tyndall employs over 500 researchers, engineers and professional support staff, with a cohort of 120 full-time post graduate students. Together with UCC they generate around 250 peer-reviewed publications annually.https://www.ucc.ie/en/research/news-events/news/tyndall- to-progress-major-expansion-under-the-governments-national-development- plan.html UCC.ie retrieved 2/10/2019 In 2019, Tyndall announced that it secured over ‚Ç¨8m in European funding as part of the Horizon 2020 programme.https://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/business/tyndall- national-institute-secures-additional-8m-in-eu-funding-948381.html Irishexaminer.com retrieved 2/10/2019 Tyndall will lead four of the 15 international multi-partner projects which it won in 2019, including a major photonics pilot line for medical technologies, a Marie-Sklowdoska-Curie career development programme for 27 fellows, two energy projects and another in cryogenic electronics for quantum technologies. This funding cements Tyndall as one of Europe‚Äôs leading institutes in the area of ‚Äòdeep tech‚Äô, the use of majorly advanced technology that will have a profound effect on the lives of citizens, as well as industry. Deep tech is used in the areas of robotics, engineering, smart industry and medical devices. Photonics Photonics devices used in the generation, control and manipulation of light are changing the way in which society live their lives. Key application areas: *Highly functional, low-cost photonic integrated circuits are needed for widespread high-bandwidth broadband availability *LEDs can provide visible light communications over short distances. *With the evolution of data centres there is a critical need for much reduced energy usage. *Light-based medical treatments and diagnostic tools will permit precise medical procedures and earlier detection of illness. *Light based sensors can detect tiny amounts of gases and other materials as our environmental concerns grow which photovoltaics allows us to harness light energy.

That is why the sermons end with ‚Ä≥Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia‚Ä≥ against Trilingual heresy. In Slavic Christianity, the trilingual heresy or Pilatian heresy (less pejoratively trilingualism) is the idea that Biblical Hebrew, Greek, and Latin are the only valid liturgical languages or languages in which one may praise God. Trilingualism was rejected in the 850s by Saints Cyril and Methodius, Byzantine brothers and missionaries who introduced a Christian liturgy in the vernacular of their Slavic converts, a language now called Old Church Slavonic. Origins The idea originates as Old Church Slavonic , (), literally meaning \\"threefold paganism\\" rather than \\"threefold heresy\\". It appears as a neologism in several chapters of a contemporary hagiography of Cyril (then named Constantine), most prominently when recounting a disputation in Venice in AD 867 while he and Methodius were en route to the Holy See, bringing relics of Pope Clement I and hoping to resolve a jurisdictional dispute in Great Moravia with Latin Rite missionaries sent by the Bishop of Salzburg. In St. Mark's Square, hostile clerics (branded \\"Latin accomplices\\" of the devil) \\"assembled against [Constantine] like ravens against a falcon and raised the trilingual heresy\\". Constantine defeated them by citing scripture and by pointing to the many precedents of Oriental Orthodox churches with vernacular liturgy. Elsewhere Constantine points out that Pontius Pilate (hence \\"Pilatian\\" heresy) used Hebrew, Greek, and Latin for the inscription on Christ's cross. In Rome Pope Adrian II duly approved the Slavonic liturgy. A generation later, Chernorizets Hrabar's defence of the Glagolitic script used to write Old Church Slavonic likewise deprecates trilingualism on the basis that the Slavs would never have been converted if their own language had not been used. Historical critiques Cyril & Methodius with sample of their script for writing Slavic Papal edicts of 870 and 880 endorsed Slavonic liturgy, whereas others of the same era do not.≈†evƒçenko 1964 p.222, esp. fn.8 Ihor ≈†evƒçenko points out that Isidore of Seville had written that Hebrew, Greek, and Latin were the languages of \\"sacred law\\". Adrian II's support for Cyril and Methodius has been interpreted as motivated a desire to check the influence of the Bishop of Salzburg, or avoid a dispute with the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople to whom Cyril and Methodius were responsible. A converse suggestion is that trilingualism was invented by the Salzburg lobby to attack Cyril and Methodius. Some historians regard trilingualism as a straw man invented by Orthodox supporters of autocephaly or national churches but never actually promoted by the Papacy or Constantinople.; cited in Riccardo Picchio regards the Venetian story as apocryphal.; cited in The Council of Tours 813 had mandated homilies in the vernacular (Romance or German). For other parts of the Catholic Mass, widespread use of the vernacular rather than Latin came after the Second Vatican Council adopted Sacrosanctum Concilium in 1963. ≈†evƒçenko sees the Byzantine church as on the one hand grudging in allowing for vernacular churches, but on the other hand characterising trilingualism after the East‚ÄìWest Schism as an error of the Western church.≈†evƒçenko 1964 pp.228‚Äì229, esp. fn.30 See also * Bible translations into Church Slavonic * Day Of Slavonic Alphabet, Bulgarian Enlightenment and Culture * Religious Procession in Kursk Governorate  References  =Sources= * =Citations= Category:Golden Age of medieval Bulgarian culture Category:Cultural history of Bulgaria Category:Cyrillo-Methodian Studies Category:History of Venice Category:Eastern Christian liturgy Category:Liturgical languages Category:Anti-Catholicism in Eastern Orthodoxy ","title":"Trilingual heresy"},{"id":"62335005","text":"The Cincinnati Wolfhounds is an American rugby team based in Cincinnati.

Founded 1 June 2004 as RISTA-EW Brigade the unit changed its name on 5 November 2018 to better reflect its mission: to collect military information on the tactical level, useful to the needs of the operational level.  History  The brigade's origins lie with the Electronic Defense Center (Centro Difesa Elettronica - CDE) raised in 1963 in Anzio. Initially the center consisted of the IX Signal Battalion and XI Signal Battalion, to which a Signals Intelligence Unit was added in the 1960s. With the 1975 army reform the center's Signals Intelligence Unit became the 8th Signals Intelligence Battalion \\"Tonale\\" and IX Signal Battalion became the 9th Electronic Warfare Battalion \\"Rombo\\". With the end of the Cold War the army reduced its forces in the Northeast of Italy and so on 1 January 1996 the center received the 33rd Electronic Warfare Battalion \\"Falzarego\\" in Treviso from the 5th Army Corps. On 20 January 1998 the center disbanded the 9th Electronic Warfare Battalion \\"Rombo\\", while the 33rd Electronic Warfare Battalion \\"Falzarego\\" was reorganized and elevated to 33rd Electronic Warfare Regiment on 28 October 2002. On 19 May 1998 the center was reorganized and renamed RISTA-EW Grouping and on 27 August 2001 the 8th Signals Intelligence Battalion \\"Tonale\\" left the Grouping and joined the 11th Signal Regiment. On 1 June 2004 the grouping was elevated to RISTA-EW Brigade, when the 41st Regiment \\"Cordenons\\" joined the grouping on that day. On 28 June 2005 the 13th Battalion \\"Aquileia\\" in Anzio was raised and joined the brigade as its Human Intelligence (HUMINT) unit. On 5 November 2018 the brigade was renamed Tactical Intelligence Brigade and on the same date the 13th Battalion \\"Aquileia\\" was reorganized and renamed 13th Regiment.

It is part of the Joffre Group, which is a subset of the Lillooet Ranges. It is situated east of Pemberton, midway between Mount Matier and Slalok Mountain, both one kilometre either side of Spetch. The mountain's name was submitted by Karl Ricker of the Alpine Club of Canada to honor Samuel W. Spetch, who operated the general store at Birken, and other businesses in Pemberton. The name was officially adopted on January 23, 1979, by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. The first ascent of the mountain was made in 1971 by J. Oswald and G. Walter. Precipitation runoff from the peak drains into Joffre Creek and Twin One Creek, both tributaries of the Lillooet River. The mountain and its climate supports the Matier Glacier on the northern slope. Climate Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Mount Spetch is located in a subarctic climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Coast Mountains where they are forced upward by the range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall. As a result, the Coast Mountains experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Temperatures can drop below ‚àí20 ¬∞C with wind chill factors below ‚àí30 ¬∞C. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for climbing Mount Spetch.

He is an Honorary Reader at the University of Sheffield, UK, Visiting Research Fellow with The Open University, and adjunct Professor with the Brain and Mind Programme at the University of Crete. He is known for his \\"illusionist\\" stance in the theory of consciousness. He holds that the conscious mind is a virtual system, a trick of the biological mind. In other words, phenomenality is an introspective illusion. This position is in opposition to dualist theories, reductive realist theories, and panpsychism.  Biography  = Early life and education = Born and raised near Doncaster in South Yorkshire, England, Frankish says he spent many hours alone reading due to childhood illness. His heroes were the cricketer Geoff Boycott, the fictional aviator Biggles, and the zoologist and humorous author Gerald Durrell. His undergraduate work was done at The Open University, where he took courses in literature, ancient history, and philosophy. He contemplated becoming a classicist but was later drawn to philosophy and psychology. He chose Philosophy of Mind because it encompassed most all his previous academic interests. His postgraduate education was at the University of Sheffield. He wrote his concluding master‚Äôs thesis on Daniel Dennett‚Äôs belief/opinion distinction. He continued at Sheffield as a doctoral student, supported by a British Academy studentship. His PhD thesis, which was supervised by Peter Carruthers and Chris Hookway, \\"distinguished two types of belief and argued for a two-level framework for folk psychology.\\" While at Sheffield he held a Temporary Lectureship in the Philosophy Department, teaching courses in mind, language, and action and was closely involved in the work of the Hang Seng Centre for Cognitive Studies. = Career = In 1999, he returned to The Open University, this time as a Lecturer in the Philosophy Department at the University‚Äôs main campus in Milton Keynes. Frankish was a Senior Member of Robinson College, Cambridge, and acted as a Director of Studies for the college, overseeing the work of the college‚Äôs cohort of philosophy students. He moved to Crete, Greece in 2008. In 2008-9 he was a Visiting Researcher in the Department of Philosophy and Social Studies at the University of Crete, and from 2010 he has been an Adjunct Professor with the University‚Äôs Brain and Mind Program. In 2017 he rejoined the Sheffield Philosophy Department as an Honorary Reader. He has published and edited many books and written twelve articles in refereed journals. As of 2019, his academic papers have over 1,700 citations. In addition to his academic writing, he frequently contributes to Aeon magazine.  Views  = Illusionism = Frankish is known for espousing the view that phenomenality is an introspective illusion. \\"We humans have learned a variety of subtle but powerful tricks ‚Äî strategies of self-control, self-manipulation, and extended problem-solving ‚Äî which vastly extend the power of our biological brains and give us the sense of having a unified, phenomenally conscious mind, self, or soul.\\" Early in his career he took a ‚Äúrobustly materialist stance‚Äù and attempted to rebut the zombie argument popularized by David Chalmers. In 2007, when he wrote the \\"Anti-Zombie Argument,\\" he endorsed a weak form of realism about qualia. In later work, however, he rejected phenomenal realism altogether, arguing that ‚Äúmaterialists should be thoroughgoing eliminativists about qualia.‚Äù He called this stance ‚Äúillusionism.‚Äù He defended this position in the 2014 ‚Äòconsciousness cruise‚Äô off Greenland sponsored by Dimitri Volkov and the Moscow Center for Consciousness Studies. It was a floating conference that featured prominent philosophers of mind such as David Chalmers, Paul Churchland, Patricia Churchland, Andy Clark, Daniel Dennett, Philip Goff, Nicholas Humphrey, Jesse Prinz, and Derk Pereboom. In 2016 he wrote a target article for a special issue of the Journal of Consciousness Studies, which included many responses by both supporters and critics of the position. In 2019, William Ramsey summarized the eliminative materialist argument thusly: In 2020, Frankish summed up the position:  Response  In a follow up to his target article in the Journal of Consciousness Studies, Frankish summarized the reactions to his article. He labeled as \\"sceptics\\" Susan Blackmore, Nicholas Humphrey, Pete Mandik, and Eric Schwitzgebel. In the category of \\"opponents\\" he included thinkers such as Katalin Balog, Philip Goff, Martine Nida-R√ºmelin, and Jesse Prinz. Additionally, Paul Boghossian has argued that eliminative materialism is self-refuting, since the theory itself presupposes the existence of mental phenomena. Jesse Prinz sought to rebut Frankish's illusionism from the perspective of reductive realism. He asserted that either illusionism collapses into realism or it introduces a deep puzzle similar to the hard problem of consciousness. Prinz concludes \\"that reductive realism is more compelling.\\" Galen Strawson called it the silliest claim ever made and compared it to Flat Eartherism. Frankish counts Daniel Dennett, Jay Garfield, Georges Rey, Amber Ross and James Tartaglia as \\"advocates,\\" and amongst the \\"explorers\\" of this idea, he counts Fran√ßois Kammerer, Michael Graziano, Nicole Marinsek, Derk Pereboom and Michael Gazzaniga. = Other interests = Frankish has published papers on the semantics of indirect discourse and conversational implicature (with Maria Kasmirli) and co-edited a volume of research papers in philosophy of action, New Waves in Philosophy of Action.

Her research investigates the degeneration of motor neurons during amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease triggered by Down syndrome.  Education  Fisher studied physiological sciences at the University of Oxford where she was an undergraduate student at St Anne's College, Oxford in 1981. After completing her undergraduate studies Fisher left science and trained as a typist and worked in several different jobs in UK and Australia and in 1983 moved to Imperial College London, where she worked on mouse molecular genetics. At St Mary's Hospital, London Fisher completed microdissection on the mouse X chromosome. During her doctoral research she worked alongside Mary F. Lyon and Stephen Brown at the Medical Research Council in Harwell. She dissected individual chromosomes and cloned DNA fragments into plasmids. Career and research After graduating from Imperial College London in 1986, Fisher moved to the United States, where she was appointed a postdoctoral fellow at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). At MIT, Fisher worked as a postdoc in the lab of David C. Page on Turner syndrome. Her early work looked at the male sex determining factor and then considered the genes responsible for Turner syndrome. Fisher returned to Imperial College London in 1990, when she was awarded a Royal Society University Research Fellowship to start an independent research group looking at aneuploidy. In collaboration with Victor Tybulewicz of the MRC, she was awarded Wellcome Trust research funding in 1991, which allowed her to expand her research into a new model of Down syndrome. In 2001 Fisher was appointed Professor at University College London and in 2017 she also set up a lab at the Medical Research Council Mouse Genetics Unit in Harwell. Her research considers motor neuron degeneration, genome editing and the development of mouse models to understand neurological disorders. Fisher received the 2011 Faculty Member of the Year Award for Neurological Disorders on Faculty of 1000 (F1000) and an Addgene Blue Flame Award in 2017 for depositing a plasmid that has been shared more than 100 times. Fisher serves as an academic editor on the journal PLoS Genetics and on the boards for the journals Disease Models and Mechanism, Mammalian Genome.https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=EMCFI97 In 2003, work from Fisher's lab provided one of the first demonstrations in a mammalian model of the link between defects in retrograde transport and neurodegeneration. In a paper published in Science, Fisher found that two spontaneous mouse mutants generated from an ENU (N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea) screen harbored missense point mutations in the cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain gene. In cells, dynein is the motor protein that moves cargos toward the minus end of microtubules. These mutants were named Loa (Legs at odd angles) and Cra1 (Cramping 1) due to the phenotypes of body twisting and hindlimb clenching when suspended by the tail. Heterozygotes show locomotion defects with neuronal loss. Homozygotes are unable to feed and move and die within 24 hours of birth, but embryonic neurons have intracellular inclusions that are positive for ubiquitin, SOD, CDK5, and neurofilament.https://science.sciencemag.org/content/300/5620/808.abstract Fisher and Tybulewicz have demonstrated that mouse models can be used to understand the genes that give rise to certain aspects of Down syndrome. Fisher and Tybulewicz were the first to successfully introduce an almost full- length human chromosome into mice ‚Äì a significant technical achievement, as it had previously only been possible to introduce small fragments of chromosomes. People with Down syndrome, a condition which occurs due to trisomy on Chromosome 21, are particularly susceptible to Alzheimer's disease. The mouse models that Fisher and Tybulewicz created have allowed scientists to study the genes responsible for complex conditions, which allows her to design synthetic chromosomes for gene therapy. Fisher has investigated a series of proteins that are modified by Alzheimer's disease and impacted by trisomy. Fisher develops new models for Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) that occurs due to mutations in the gene FUS. ALS is a form of motor neuron disease that occurs during middle age, whereas spinal muscular atrophy is the most common genetic killer of children. Whilst it is well known that certain genes cause motor neuron disease, it is not clear how mutations impact the disease progression. Working with Medical Research Council Harwell; Fisher has looked at the molecular changes that occur during ALS. She has investigated how the RNA- binding protein mutant FUS behaves in mouse models. Fisher serves as a Council Member at the Academy of Medical Sciences. = Selected publications = * The sex-determining region of the human Y chromosome encodes a finger protein * Genealogies of mouse inbred strains * Mutations in the endosomal ESCRTIII- complex subunit CHMP2B in frontotemporal dementia =Awards and honours= She was elected a Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences (FMedSci) in 2007 and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Biology (FRSB) in 2010.

After time more buildings were added to the property. = Mid 1900s = In the 60's the hotel was frequented by hunters who wanted a clean place to stay that offered fast and early breakfast, which they got. = Late 1900s = The hotel joined the Best Western franchise and was now known as Best Western Paramount, still under the ownership of Fred Gasthalter. According to Fred, joining Best Western was \\"The greatest thing yet\\".  The Fire  On October 16, 2000 around 3 AM the front desk received a call saying there was smoke in the kitchen, she then called 911 because of the report of smoke. Over 100 firefighters from 6 different companies responded to the fire, saving it from total destruction but failing to save the lobby, nightclub, kitchen and offices. The day before the fire the hotel was running a Jewish educational program, some of them were still staying at the hotel for a bit longer. It was a described as a \\"Nightmare\\", Over 300 guests, some disabled and many seniors had to be evacuated and thankfully all of the guests were evacuated.  Modern Day  = Buying The Paramount = In 2004 somebody bought The Paramount for $4,000,000 after the original owner filed for bankruptcy. Today, the hotel is for sale for about $5,000,000. = The Condition Today = Today the hotel still stands but it is extremely vandalized, most if no all windows are smashed and some walls are destroyed (Specifically the walls in the pool room). The indoor pool is filled with trash and even hydrocloric acid that was poured in by a random vandal.

In 1559 he accompanied Philip II to Spain, then returned to the Low Countries, where he was aligned with his oldest brother, Antoine Perrenot de Granvelle. He served against the Dutch Revolt under the command of Fadrique de Toledo, before returning to Burgundy to command the garrison at Besan√ßon. In 1571 he was appointed Governor of Antwerp. In a memorandum to the Duke of Medinaceli in 1573 he criticised the policy of terror that had been pursued by the Duke of Alva, the arrogance and tyranny of Spanish soldiery, and the infringement of ancient customs and liberties. Between 1574 and 1576 he was much away from Antwerp on diplomatic missions. Returning to Antwerp in the summer of 1576, he several times wrote to the Council of State warning of the mounting dangers of the situation there.J. Van Vloten, Brieven van F. Perrenot de Champagney (julij-october 1576), offprint from Bijdragen tot the Oudheidkunde en Geschiedenis, inzonderheid van Zeeuwsch-Vlaanderen, 5 (1860), pp. 238-273. At the Sack of Antwerp in November 1576 he sought refuge in Middelburg. His house in Antwerp was looted by the mutineers. He was a supporter of the Pacification of Ghent, agreed later the same month, but while criticising royal policy he remained loyal to the king. In 1578 he was imprisoned in Ghent by the rebels, and several times threatened with death. In June 1579 he briefly escaped but was recaptured. While in captivity, he wrote pamphlets against the rebels, including Advis d'ung bon bourgois de la ville de Gand, clandestinely printed in 1583, which elicited a reply from Marnix of Saint-Aldegonde. After the reconciliation of Ghent on 17 September 1584, Perrenot was liberated through a prisoner exchange. He was appointed commander of Ghent citadel, with a garrison of Walloon troops. In September 1585 he was again appointed governor of Antwerp, where he negotiated the rebuilding of Antwerp Citadel with the city council, but was removed from office the following year. He became a vocal critic of Alexander Farnese, who on 14 October 1592 ordered him to leave Brussels and return to his native Burgundy. He settled in Dole, dying there in 1600.

He is recognized for his research in catalysis science and engineering, especially, his contributions to the understanding of the catalytic breakdown of cellulose to renewable chemicals, the invention of oleo-furan surfactants, and the development of catalytic resonance theory. Early Life and Education Paul Dauenhauer was born in 1980 in Texas, USA, and was raised in Wisconsin Rapids, WI, attending Lincoln High School. He received his bachelor's degree in chemical engineering and chemistry at the University of Wisconsin, Madison in 2004. Working under the supervision of Lanny Schmidt at the University of Minnesota, Dauenhauer received his Ph.D. in chemical engineering in 2008 from the Department of Chemical Engineering & Materials Science. His dissertation described the development of reactive flash volatilization and was titled \\"Millisecond autothermal catalytic reforming of carbohydrates for synthetic fuels by reactive flash volatilization\\". Career Following graduation from Minnesota, Dauenhauer served as a Senior Research Engineer at the Dow Chemical Company in Midland, MI, and Freeport, TX. He started as an Assistant Professor at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst in 2009 before promotion to Associate Professor in 2014. In 2014, he moved to the Department of Chemical Engineering & Materials Science (CEMS) at the University of Minnesota, where he was promoted to Professor, and then and Lanny Schmidt Honorary Professor in 2019. During this time, he co-founded or contributed to the founding of startup companies Activated Research Company, Sironix Renewables, and enVerde, LLC. =Renewable Chemicals= Dauenhauer's focus on renewable chemicals produced from glucose has targeted both drop-in replacement chemicals and new chemicals with novel characteristics. In 2012, he discovered a high yield pathway to synthesize p-xylene from glucose; this molecule is the key ingredient in polyethylene terephthalate plastic. This process technology utilized a new class of weak acid zeolites that permits the manufacture of biorenewable polyester. In 2015, Dauenhauer and his team developed a new class of surfactants, detergents, and soaps that are derived from biomass (furans from sugars and fatty acids from triglycerides, oleo-furan sulfonates (OFS). These molecules were shown to have high hard water stability (>1000 ppm Ca++) and are being commercialized by Sironix Renewables, Inc. In 2016, Dauenhauer and Abdelrahman developed the acid-catalyzed dehydra-decyclization mechanism that simultaneously opens cyclic ether rings and dehydrates to synthesize diene products. This technology was subsequently used to optimize the catalytic production of isoprene, the key chemical in the production of car tires. Subsequent research identified pathways to similarly convert biomass-derived tetrahydrofuran to butadiene and 2-methyl-tetrahydrofuran to piperylene. Key publications include: *C.L. Williams, C.C.

He further outlined the challenges in understanding high temperature cellulose chemistry by publishing his \\"Top Ten Challenges\\" of biomass pyrolysis in 2012, one of which was based on his discovery of the mechanism of aerosol formation through liquid intermediate cellulose. Dauenhauer further developed a new reactor technique called 'PHASR' (Pulse-Heated Analysis of Solid Reactions) which led to the first isothermal kinetics of cellulose conversion and product formation. This technique permitted a molecular analysis of cellulose activation and the discovery that cellulose has a unique reaction transition at 467 deg C. The high temperature kinetic transition was attributed to the catalytic role of chain-to-chain cellulose hydroxyl groups in stabilizing the chain fragmentation of inter- monomer bonds.

Optimal catalyst performance is depicted as a 'volcano' peak using a descriptor of the chemical reaction defining different catalytic materials. Experimental evidence of the Sabatier principle was first demonstrated by Balandin in 1960. In his initial discovery of the behavior of oscillating chemical reactions on metal surfaces, Dauenhauer showed that steady state reaction rates could achieve chemical reaction speeds as much as 1000 times greater than previously achievable rates, even with optimized catalytic systems. This work broke down surface chemical reactions into its component parts and associated natural frequencies, which could be matched to resonate with the catalytic surface frequencies. Follow-up work on catalytic resonance theory by Dauenhauer and his team broadened to understand the relationship between surface chemistry with its linear scaling relationships and the surface binding energy oscillation waveform. He introduced the concept of superVolcanoes as a superposition of all possible Sabatier volcanoes for varying linear scaling parameters, before further connecting the behavior of oscillating catalytic surfaces to molecular machines and pumps.

The district includes 255 buildings, all but three of which are Chicago bungalows. In the early twentieth century, tens of thousands of Chicago bungalows were built in the city; as homeownership became more accessible to working-class Chicagoans, demand for housing increased, and bungalows were an affordable way of meeting this demand due to their relatively uniform design. The bungalows in the district were largely built either between 1917 and 1918 or between 1922 and 1926. Unlike Chicago's other bungalow-dominated neighborhoods, which often had several different developers, developer Albert J. Schorsch built every bungalow in the district, and architech Ernest N. Braucher designed all of them. To add diversity to a neighborhood made up of only one style of house, the two men varied the homes' roof shapes, colors, and dormers. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places on February 25, 2004.

Life  M√∂ller was born and raised in Gotha. After his vocational training in A levels, he worked as an officer in the National People's Army and the Bundeswehr from 1979 to 2014. In the early 1990s, M√∂ller started researching World War II in his free time, publishing from 2003 to 2007 in Arps Verlag Wei√üenfels. He retired in 2014, and has since devoted himself to writing a book as a military historian and assisting in the creation of military- historical reconstructions for the detection of explosive ordnance. Since 2010, M√∂ller has published his research results on the American occupation of Central Germany in the context of the documentary series The End of the War in Central Germany 1945 at the publishing house . He regularly presents his findings in lectures and as a consultant for television productions on the history of Central Germany. M√∂ller researches worldwide, and has been particularly intrigued by finding the name of the last person to die in the war. The American war photographer Robert Capa's work The Picture of the Last Man to Die has provided the crucial clue that, 67 years after the war, the identity of the American soldier Raymond J. Bowman could be determined. Bowman was fatally shot by a German sniper on a balcony in Leipzig-Lindenau. In the 2017 special issue Concentration Camp Buchenwald Weimar April 1945 by Verlag Rockstuhl, M√∂ller was able to prove scientifically who liberated the Buchenwald concentration camp based on American documents that contradicted previous findings; that units of the 4th US Armored Division had reached Buchenwald before the 6th US Armored Division, and thus triggered all other events that led to the final liberation of the Buchenwald concentration camp.Ankunft der Patrouille von Captain Frederic Keffer (Keffer-Patrouille) am 11.

It is native to Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania and is widespread and abundant in the understorey of wet forests. The name raspwort refers to the rough, scabrous surface of many of the Gonocarpus species. The specific epithet, teucrioides, derives from Teucrium and the Greek suffix -oides which indicates resemblance, thereby giving an adjective meaning that the species resembles the plants in the genus, Teucrium.  Habit  G. teucrioides in flower G. teucrioides leaves/habit It is an erect perennial herb, woody at the base, 30‚Äì40 cm tall and 20‚Äì30 cm wide. Its stems are 4-angled in cross section. Leaves are opposite and ovate, with toothed margins and 7‚Äì22 mm long. They have a dark green upper surface and a lighter undersurface, stems are often reddish. Both the leaves and stems have stiff, spreading hairs. Flowers are small and solitary, occurring in pairs of bracts in the leaf axils along the lower section of the flowering stem. They are carried in racemes at the end of the stem. Bracts are green and fleshy, petals are green to reddish. Plants are monoecious, and flowering occurs from October to January. Fruit is an ovoid, silver-grey ribbed nut, about 1.5 mm long.  Habitat  Native to Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania, Gonocarpus teucrioides prefers moist, well-drained soils in semi-shade. It is thus common in the understorey of open or partially open forests and vegetation types, especially those subjected to enhanced runoff or higher rainfall.

History  Originally launched under the name Obtainium in 2014, Opus 12 was officially founded in 2015 by Dr. Kendra Kuhl, Dr. Etosha Cave, and Nicholas Flanders. The company was part of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory's first Cyclotron Road cohort, an incubator program that aids in the creation of environmentally beneficial companies. Since then, the company has won multiple awards including the Keeling Curve prize, Ocean Exchange's WW Orcelle award, the Roddenberry prize, and Forbes' Change the World competition. Opus 12 has received funding through SBIR grants for projects involving CO2 conversion. This includes generating products such as CO, polyethylene, ethanol, ethylene, methane, and jet fuel. The company has also been featured on the television show Inside Bill's Brain as a company providing a potential solution to greenhouse gas emissions.  Technology  Nicholas Flanders describes the company's technology as \\"industrial photosynthesis\\" to create jet fuel and diesel from carbon dioxide. Their technology has been shown to convert CO2 from raw biogas into carbon neutral methane. Opus 12 utilizes polymer electrolyte membrane electrolysis, which splits apart water molecules into its component pieces (O2, electrons, and hydrogen ions) via the application of electricity. By adding a catalyst to the cathode, they are able to split up CO2 into CO and O2.

History  The Chronicle came into existence at the beginning of 1819, under the control of John Alexander Macauley and Alexander John Pringle. Nearing the end of 1818, Stephen Miles, a founder and then current publisher of The Kingston Gazette, had become embroiled with some local trouble. A Scottish land agent named Robert Gourley, whose anti-Family Compact views Miles had supported, had become increasingly violent in his dealings with Kingston locals. Miles had withdrawn his support, and felt the man's brunt turned against him. As his entrenchment in the politics of the situation deepen, Miles decided to oust himself and sell his stake to Macauley and Pringle, whom kept him on as printer. For more information on Stephen Miles, please see the Kingston Gazette. Born October 17, 1792, Macauley also served as Deputy Postmaster of Kingston and a Justice of the Peace during his time owning and editing the Chronicle,. He served as a trustee of the Midland District Grammar School, an officer of the local militia, chairman of the Court of General Quarter Sessions of the Peace, warden of St. George's Church, agent for the Bank of Upper Canada in Kingston, president of the Mechanics' Institute, legislative councillor, surveyor-general, civil secretary, inspector-general, and president of the Commercial Bank of the Midland District in the 1840s. Macauley was married twice, first to Helen Macpherson in October 1833, and then to Sarah Phillis Young in March 1853. Like Miles, he too had had run-ins with Gourley, and espoused his views in a letter in the Gazette, as well as editorials for the Chronicle. Macauley died in Kingston, August 10, 1857. Alexander Pringle was born 1777 and died in Kingston on September 1850. His obituary listed him as Clerk of the District Court for the United Counties of Frontenac, Lennox and Addington. He was also cited as co- creating the first agricultural society in 1818 for the same United Counties, and served as an inspector to the Kingston Penitentiary, and was a Justice of the Peace for the Midland District. The paper remained under their control until July 1, 1824, when it passed into the hands of James Macfarlane. The Chronicle continued until 1833, when it was superseded by The Kingston Chronicle & Gazette.

Library Journal, para. 1. which lead to the publishing in August 2019 of her first book, The Pretty One: On Life, Pop Culture, Disability, and Other Reasons to Fall in Love, with Me. = The Pretty One (Book) = Brown's first book, The Pretty One: On Life, Pop Culture, Disability, and Other Reasons to Fall in Love, with Me, published by Atria Publishing Group, is a collection of personal essays/stories in which she relates to popular culture, beauty and body image, romantic love, and physical pain as a black woman with both cerebral palsy (a physical disability) and invisible disabilities. Brown also writes about her relationship with her non-disabled identical twin. = Media Appearances = Brown was featured on 3rd Hour of Today on November 7, 2019, when she was interviewed by Sheinelle Jones and Dylan Dreyer. Earlier in 2019, the New York Times also named Brown as having been chosen by Brie Larson, the lead role in Captain Marvel (film) (2019), to profile Larson for the international magazine, Marie Claire. Handpicking Brown was part of Larsen‚Äôs ‚Äú[vow] to seek out more underrepresented journalists.‚Äù Back in September of 216, Amy Poehler's Smart Girls profiled Brown in the article titled \\"Meet Smart Girl Keah Brown: Brilliant writer and disability activist.\\"  Literary Work  Brown's work has appeared in a number of literary magazines, such as Wildness, an online bimonthly that Poets & Writers Magazine has called one of \\"Nine New Lit Mags You Need to Read.\\" Poets & Writers reviews Wildness: \\"Launched in December 2015, Wildness features formally inventive work by both established and emerging writers that embraces the mysteries of the self and the outside world. Issue Five, Tranquility, features new poetry from Cynthia Arrieu-King and Christopher Citro, fiction from Renee Bibby and Wyl Villacres, an essay by Keah Brown, and more.\\" Brown's writings have covered a range of genres and subjects, from fiction and nonfiction, blogging, interviews, and essays to pieces pertaining to movies and TV, beauty and fashion, sports, and other popular culture, as well as to body positivity and her relationship to body image as a black woman having grown up with cerebral palsy. She has written for Cosmopolitan (magazine), Teen Vogue, Harper‚Äôs Bazaar, Refinery29, and Bustle (magazine), among others, as well as online women‚Äôs organizations and under-represented communities‚Äô media outlets, such as Essence (magazine), Disability Visibility Project, DIVERSEability, Amy Poehler's Smart Girls, Bitch Magazine, The Establishment, and Gay Mag (a partnership between Roxane Gay and Medium). Brown contributed an essay for the literary magazine Catapult called \\"Love, Disability, and Movies,\\" on how ‚Äúmy black disabled body is not the body reflected on screen,‚Äù in the romantic comedies and dramas to which she relates. The rights to Brown's picture book debut, Sam's Super Seats, have been acquired by Sydnee Monday at Kokila. The story, about loving yourself, laughter, and the importance of rest, follows a girl with cerebral palsy who goes back-to-school shopping with her best friends. Sharee Miller (author and illustrator of Don't Touch My Hair!) will be illustrating the book, which is scheduled to be published in the fall of 2020.  Activism  As a disabled black woman and activist, Brown has been known as a critic of the entertainment industry. In June 2016, Brown wrote the article, \\"Season Four of ‚ÄòOrange Is the New Black‚Äô Has a Race Problem,\\" which would be cited later in the peer-reviewed Canadian Review of American Studies, in 2017. In September 2016, Amy Poehler's Smart Girls did an interview with Brown that reflected some of Brown's other writings when she said she wanted \\"to see more women of color with disabilities, specifically black women\\" acting in lead roles on film and TV. In February 2017, Brown started the viral campaign, #DisabledAndCute (see above). In 2018, following the death of Stephen Hawking, Brown was one of multiple activists who \\"took to social media to protest the portrayal of Hawking in death as 'freeing,' and a meme of him standing, having walked away from his wheelchair, looking up at the stars.\\" Brown had stated that that kind of representation signified \\"to other disabled people that we should be excited for the opportunity to be 'free' of our bodies, but it also reduces Stephen Hawking, one of the greatest intellectuals ever, to his disability and nothing more.\\" Brown also questioned in 2018 the entertainment industry‚Äôs use of remakes, tweeting: ‚ÄúInstead of rebooting shows, why not try letting black and brown people share our ideas for brand new shows where we exist?‚Äù Bitch Magazine has described Brown as \\"on a mission to change how disabled people are perceived in pop culture, in fashion, and in our everyday lives.\\"[Review of The pretty one: On life, pop culture, disability, and other reasons to fall in love with me].

She was named one of the BBC's 100 Women for 2019. Bakirya was born in the Bugosa District of Uganda, and raised on a farm, though she did not initially intend to be a farmer. As a child, in addition to working on her family's farm, Bakirya and her sisters attended school, thanks to the assistance of her father, a chief. Her success at her primary school qualified her for a scholarship to the prestigious secondary school, Mt St Mary's College Namagunga, something no other student at her school had accomplished. From there, she qualified for a government scholarship to attend university, and earned a Masters in health and development from Birmingham University in the UK. In 2000, Bakirya quit her job at an NGO in order to return to farming. Using her savings and a small loan from the village Savings and Loans Association, she founded Busaino Fruits & Trees . In 2014, she won the Best Farmers competition sponsored by Vision Group, the Netherlands Embassy in Uganda, KLM Airlines and dfcu Bank. The prize included a chance to exhibit at the Source of the Nile Agriculture Show and to attend agricultural exhibitions in the Netherlands. After this, she opened her own exhibition centre for traditional medicine and culture in Uganda's Jinja District. In 2017, she began the National Agro-Tourism Institute in Jinja to further promote Ugandan agro-tourism and education. Bakirya now runs Busaino Fruits & Trees as an agro-heritage fruit farm of more than 1,000 acres, with a heavy emphasis on agro-tourism and education regarding environmentally sustainable farming practices.

Born in Moscow, Motsak grew up in Sevastopol, attending the and starting his naval career as an engineer in the Pacific Fleet. Rising through the ranks to more senior positions, he served on submarines in various roles, transferring to the Northern Fleet and his own submarine commands in 1982. Commended for his performance, Motsak graduated to various staff positions in the fleet, was promoted to rear-admiral in 1993 and became commander in 1993. In 1994 he was awarded the title of Hero of the Russian Federation. In May 1999 Motsak was appointed Chief of Staff and First Deputy Commander of the Northern Fleet. Part of his duties included organising the fleet's exercises for summer 2000,the first in a decade. During the exercises the submarine Kursk suffered a series of catastrophic explosions and sank. Motsak was deeply involved in rescue attempts to reach the stricken submarine before officials learned that the entire crew of 118 had died. He commanded the salvage operation the following year. Motsak was among the fleet's officers to be criticised in the subsequent investigation into the disaster. He was demoted and forced to resign. He became deputy to the Presidential Envoy to the Northwestern Federal District for a time. Later he worked in the private sector with marine engineering companies. Over his career he had received several awards in addition to the title of Hero of the Russian Federation, including the Order \\"For Merit to the Fatherland\\" Fourth Class, the Order of Honour and the Order \\"For Personal Courage\\". He died in 2019 and was buried in the Serafimovskoe Cemetery in his home city of Saint Petersburg. Early life and career The , where Motsak studied in the 1970s Motsak was born on 22 November 1949 in Moscow, then part of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic in the Soviet Union. His family moved to Sevastopol during his childhood, and Motsak grew up and attended high school there. After graduating from high school, he enrolled in the . He graduated in 1972 with a specialty in submarine missile guidance systems, and was assigned to serve as a senior engineer in the Pacific Fleet. After service in shore-based weapons installations as engineer and then senior engineer, Motsak transferred to the submarine service. Between 1974 and 1979 he was promoted from armament commander to assistant commander, and then senior assistant commander of a nuclear submarine. He completed the in 1982. Motsak was next assigned to the Northern Fleet, where from 1982 he commanded the K-517. During his time in command, the K-517 received several commendations for excellence, and for two years received the title of the best submarine in the navy. From August 1985 until 1991, Motsak was deputy commander of the 33rd submarine division of the Northern Fleet. During this time he attended the A. A. Grechko Naval Academy, graduating in 1987 with the award of a gold medal. In June 1991 he became commander of the 11th submarine division. On 18 February 1993 he was promoted to rear-admiral. In August 1993 he was appointed chief of staff of the , and in December the following year was appointed the flotilla's commander. On 15 June 1994 he was awarded the title of Hero of the Russian Federation, with the accompanying Gold Star \\"for courage and heroism shown in the performance of military duty\\". In August 1995 he oversaw a missile-firing exercise from a Typhoon-class submarine at the North Pole, commanded by . On 22 February 1996 he was promoted to vice- admiral. Chief of Staff of the Northern Fleet In May 1999 Motsak was appointed Chief of Staff and First Deputy Commander of the Northern Fleet. He had by this stage of his career served on 24 long-distance voyages, sailing a total of 390,000 miles. Among the operations he undertook were two trans- arctic voyages to transfer submarines of the Northern Fleet to the Pacific. The first was in August and September 1991, during which two submarines, the K-173 and the , were transferred. In the second, the K-456, under the command of Captain 1st Rank , was transferred between 18 August and 14 September 1993. =Loss of the Kursk= Oscar II-class submarine, of the same class as the Kursk As chief of staff of the Northern Fleet, Motsak had responsibility for planning the exercises that were to take place in summer 2000. Several submarines were assigned to the exercises: the Borisoglebsk, Karelia, , , Daniil Moskovsky, and the Oscar II-class Kursk. The exercises were overseen by Northern Fleet commander Admiral Vyacheslav Popov, 1st Submarine Flotilla commander Vice-Admiral Oleg Burtsev, and Vice-Admiral Yuri Boyarkin, the fleet's deputy commander for combat training, all based aboard the Northern Fleet's flagship, the battlecruiser Pyotr Velikiy. On 11 August the crew of the Kursk, led by Captain 1st Rank Gennady Lyachin, carried out a test launch of a Granit cruise missile. The next morning Kursk was preparing to fire a practice torpedo at the Pyotr Velikiy. A hydrogen peroxide leak in the torpedo caused it to explode while in the forward torpedo compartment, starting a fire and destroying two compartments. The ship sank to the seabed where within a few minutes the fire caused the remaining torpedoes to detonate. This destroyed much if the front part of the Kursk, killing most of the 118 crew members. The nuclear generators shut down safely. Some 23 survivors gathered from the aft compartments into the last, ninth compartment of the submarine to await rescue. Some hours after the explosion, concerned at the Kursks failure to report in, Popov ordered Motsak to alert the fleet's rescue forces. Six hours after the Kursks sinking, Motsak ordered the fleet's rescue vessel, the Mikhail Rudnitsky to come to one-hour readiness to put to sea. An hour later Motsak ordered five Ilyushin Il-38s to begin searching the exercise area, subsequently supplementing the effort with six helicopters. It is believed that most of the crew died within 6 hours of the explosions, before the sub was even identified as missing. Motsak was due to give a press conference on 15 August, four days after the Kursk sank. He was replaced at the last minute by Igor Baranov, of the Rubin Design Bureau, which had designed Kursk. It was not until 20 August that Motsak admitted that the Russian Navy had no deep sea, saturation divers, using this as justification to accept aid from foreign navies. On 21 August divers were finally accessed the submarine and opened the aft escape hatch. They confirmed that there were no survivors from the 118 men who had been aboard. Motsak announced the news. \\"Our worst expectations are confirmed. All sections of the submarine are totally flooded and not a single member of the crew remains alive.\\" Motsak was one of a number of officers who suggested that a foreign submarine had collided with the Kursk and caused the disaster. During the recovery of bodies, a note written by Dmitry Kolesnikov, the senior ranking survivor of the initial explosions, was found. In a televised announcement from fleet headquarters at Severomorsk, Motsak announced the recovery of the first bodies from the wreck, and a summary of the contents of the note. The , Motsak's flagship during the salvage operation Motsak oversaw the salvage operation to raise the wreck of the Kursk between July and October 2001, with the Udaloy-class destroyer as his flagship. Motsak said that \\"the first and main reason to raise the Kursk is to get the nuclear reactors off the seabed. Secondly, we have to raise it to fulfil our human obligation to all those who died on board and to give them a respectable burial.\\" After extensive preparations, Kursk was lifted from the seabed in the early hours of 7 October 2001. Prior to the lifting, Motsak had honoured an old naval tradition by spitting three times over his left shoulder. Reflecting on the hazardous nature of the operation, he said to the assembled experts that \\"once we reach the shore, we will have a good drink, according to Russian custom.\\" The salvage operation was a success, and the wreck being safely brought into Roslyakovo on 10 October. A subsequent investigation led by Prosecutor General Vladimir Ustinov laid part of the blame for the tragedy on Motsak, and Captain 1st Rank Teslenko, chief of the Northern Fleet's submarine rescue service. The investigation criticised the lack of proper training. On 1 December 2001 Motsak was demoted, along with Admiral Popov and Vice-Admiral Oleg Burtsev, the commander of the 1st Submarine Flotilla, while eleven other senior naval officers were sacked. Motsak was relieved of his post and forced to resign. Retirement In January 2002, now retired from the navy, Motsak was appointed deputy to the Presidential Envoy to the Northwestern Federal District. He served in this role under Ilya Klebanov from 2004 until 2012. In 2009 both Motsak and Klebanov were implicated in a political scandal related to the use of the historic cruiser Aurora as a venue for parties for VIPs. Captain 1st rank Anatoly Bazhanov of the Aurora was subsequently sacked. After serving as deputy to the Presidential Envoy, Motsak entered the private sector. He became head of Marine Integrated Systems LLC, and from 2015 was CEO of a private company involved in the construction of ships, boats and floating structures. The St. Nicholas Naval Cathedral in Saint Petersburg, where Motsak's memorial service was held Motsak died in Saint Petersburg on 19 October 2019. His death was announced by the Saint Petersburg Navy Sailors and Veterans Club, who said that he had died at the S.M. Kirov Military Medical Academy \\"after a serious and prolonged illness\\". The incumbent commander of the Northern Fleet, Vice-Admiral Aleksandr Moiseyev, expressed his condolences. Retired admiral stated that Motsak was a \\"real submariner, a competent specialist and a caring commander.\\" A funeral service was held at the St. Petersburg Naval Institute on 22 October, with a second service later that day at the St. Nicholas Naval Cathedral. Motsak was buried in Serafimovskoe Cemetery in Saint Petersburg, the same cemetery where many of the Kursk crewmen were interred. Over his career he had received, in addition to the award of Hero of the Russian Federation, the Order \\"For Merit to the Fatherland\\" Fourth Class in 1998, the Order \\"For Personal Courage\\" in 1993, the Order of Honour on 10 May 2009, the Order of the Red Star in 1980, the Order \\"For Service to the Homeland in the Armed Forces of the USSR\\" Third Class in 1984, and fifteen medals.

It has some architectural similarities to the nearby Eldridge Street Synagogue. Following abandonment of the building in the 1970s, a group of tenants organized themselves and applied for funding through Federal and municipal programs to take ownership of the building in return repayment of a 30-year loan and for sweat equity work to rehabilitate the building.  History  In 1974, a group purchased 519 East 11th Street from New York City for $100 per unit, under the Division of Alternative Management Program and with assistance from the Urban Homesteading Assistance Board, and received a $177,000 low-interest loan from the city to aid with repairs. Tenants were able to become co-owners of the building by purchasing units at $500 from the group that purchased the building, or by putting in equivalent sweat equity. The building included eleven units in a total of 10,410 square feet.Copeland, Charles C. \\"Manhattan Tenement Adds Solar Heater,\\" Building Systems Design. Oct/Nov 1975, pg 15-17.

Charles Copeland was hired by the tenants to oversee the project of installing solar heating.  Windmill  519 East 11th Street became famous for the windmill constructed on its roof, designed to provide power for the building. It had the phrase \\"El Movimiento de la Calle Once:‚Äù The 11th Street movement\\" written on its tail blade. This windmill was constructed with the assistance of Windworks, a renewable energy company created with the support of Buckminster Fuller. Excess energy, beyond what was consumed by tenants in the building, was pushed back onto Con Edison's grid by causing the meter to run backwards; as a result, the building was sued by Con Edison. Under volunteer representation from Ramsey Clark, the Public Service Commissioner ruled in favor of the tenants. This ruling played a key role in creation of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA) in 1978. Ed Koch, and Robert and Lola Redford, visited the building to see the famed windmill. The MacNeil/Lehrer Report filmed an episode of its show on the roof of the building, to showcase the windmill. The windmill was credited with powering the building through the 1977 blackout, even while the surrounding neighborhood lost power. The windmill only functioned for a few years, because it was difficult to maintain.

The variable can be observed or inferred and is a type that might be used in factor analyses. An annoyance _effect_ (aka nuisance or irritation) is a reference to the impact or result of an annoying stimuli, which can be a strategic aspect of an advertisement intended to help a message stick in the minds of consumers. References to annoyance effects have been referred to as annoyance _dynamics_. While the words \\"factor\\" and \\"effect,\\" as used in the behavioral sciences, have different meanings, in casual vernacular, they have been used interchangeably as synonymous. A more general or umbrella term would simply be advertising annoyance.  History  Comment on advertising in 1850 associated some practices (disparagingly) with begging. = Measuring annoyance factors = The discipline of identifying and measuring annoyance in quantitative research became prevalent around 1968, an outgrowth of the quant revolution in social sciences that began in the 1950s. Before that, use and assessment ‚Äì theoretical and applied (pre-testing, case studies, etc.) ‚Äì was mostly qualitative (even simply intuitive or anecdotal); although the literature, since 1968, has been a mix of qualitative and quant. Identifying, testing, and evaluating annoyance factors is both cross-disciplinary and interdisciplinary. Activity includes psychology, sociology, anthropology, semiotics, economics, management science, and (since the advent of the information revolution about 1992) many fields related to information technology and engineering. Generally, annoyance from an ad can be identified in three areas: # content # execution # placement = Annoyance in ad production and placement = Setting aside advances in technology, the interdisciplinary fields involved in production phases of broadcast media (including digital online) that deal with advertising annoyance ‚Äì including film (videography), music, art, design, and copy ‚Äì have remained relatively similar since the dawn of broadcasting.  Applications  An annoyance _stimulus_ can be (a) a desired marketing strategy or (b) an unavoidable, albeit inherent mix of attributes of a marketing message to weigh and balance or minimize. Traditional annoyance stimuli might feature repetitive phrases or repetitive ads or an annoying communicator. Annoyance stimuli ‚Äì whether nuanced, subtle, or overt ‚Äì might involve creating an unpleasant sound, such as a bad jingle ‚Äì one that consumers can't get out of their heads. In the Northeastern United States, specifically the New York and Philadelphia metropolitan areas, the Mister Softee jingle, officially titled \\"Jingle and Chimes,\\" is both loved and hated. It sticks in people's heads. The New York Times characterized it as \\"exquisitely Pavlovian, triggering salivation or shrieking ‚Äî sometimes both at once.\\" In the same article, the New York Times asserted that \\"it is the textbook embodiment of an earworm: once heard, never forgotten.\\" Generally, broadcast and streaming advertising is annoying. Exceptions might include product placement ‚Äì which avoids interruptions. Advertisers commonly try to appeal to positive emotions ‚Äì and, with a careful mix of various gradations of annoyance(s), appealing to those emotions can be achieved. Nonetheless, the goal is to etch a message in the minds of consumers without turning them off. Capital outlay for the use of it can be relatively expensive for major consumer product companies and the research behind it, sophisticated. Annoyance stimuli ‚Äì visual or auditory or perceptual ‚Äì can be in any combination of loudness, repetition, length On television, radio, print media, packaging, product displays, billboards, mail, telemarketing (especially robocalls), the internet ‚Äì including email, and mobile devices, e.g.: * banners * pop-ups * floating ads * interstitials * prevideo (skip and no-skip) * autoplay video * skyscrapers * large rectangles * sponsored social media content * digital on-screen graphic also direct-to-consumer ads (especially pharmaceuticals), call to action marketing, and false ads. The annoyance stimuli of some ad campaigns might be so subtle that, initially, it is unnoticeable, but over time, highly noticeable. For instance, Folgers Coffee, which was acquired by Procter & Gamble in 1963, ran high frequency ads on TV and in print from 1965 to 1986 featuring \\"Mrs. Olson,\\" portrayed by actress Virginia Christine (1920‚Äì1996). Some consumers initially perceived her messages as pleasant, but over time, annoying ‚Äì as some research found. Yet, the annoyance technique was a successful brand-strengthening strategy. Under P&G;, Folgers became the number one coffee brand in America. The target market of P&G;'s high-frequency campaign became multipronged. Consumers who infrequently watched TV were likely to see the message at least once (an effective reach strategy) ‚Äì while those who binge-watched, even if annoyed, might still choose Folgers, if for no other reason, because the name is etched in their minds (an effective weight strategy). Although interruptions are annoying ‚Äì whether high-frequency or long run-slots ‚Äì the disruptions caused by the interruptions are most often intentional efforts to redirect the attention of viewers with the aim of sharpening their focus. Primetime TV (as of 2019) has breaks that run back-to-back 30-second ads for as long as 6-minute intervals. = Annoyance factor thresholds = When advertisers intentionally use annoyance stimuli, they strive to know annoyance _thresholds_ (compare to anxiety _thresholds_ ) and carefully monitor them. Crossing thresholds can adversely affect brands and consumer behavior. For example, TV channel surfing ‚Äì especially in eras following the emergence of remote controls, is a concern for advertisers and program producers. To mitigate viewer drift from surfing, programmers strategically place ads just moments in front of the apex of a plot device or rising action or climax or conclusion or in the midst of suspense ‚Äì leaving viewers hanging. It doesn't significantly deter channel surfing, but it does lure surfers back. Strategic timing, however, is not commonly deployed in internet broadcasts. For example, a YouTube re-broadcast of CNN news might simply insert ad interruptions in random spots. Another way that major TV networks attempt to mitigate viewer drift from surfing is to synchronize ad-breaks with those of other networks so that their respective ads run at the same time; when a viewer switches to another channel during a commercial break, they will be switching to another advertisement. In some situations, the same sponsor will air an ad simultaneously on one or more of the other channels. Advertising in premium venues or platforms (where consumers have already paid) ‚Äì movie theaters, cable TV, satellite radio ‚Äì are routine and generally accepted. Any associated annoyance factors, even perceptions of bait-and-switch, are dismissed by consumers as negative albeit long-standing unavoidable economic realities of the respective industries. Email spam, universally accepted as an annoyance factor threshold breach, can be effective from a statistical perspective. However, since 1998, when unsolicited _political_ bulk email first became widespread, legal analyst Seth Grossman pointed out (in 2004) that state and federal governments increasingly have regulated unsolicited commercial email, but political spam had almost uniformly been exempted. Grossman averred that politicians apparently did not feel a need to regulate political spam, their argument being that they would never use spam, due to the annoyance factor.  Challenges of minimizing avoidance of longer ads  For DVR-TiVo users, studies have shown that short ads, 5 seconds, are more effective than 30-second (and longer) ads ‚Äì due to the annoyance factor of longer ads. The problem, however, is whether programmers can sell 5-second ads instead of 30-second (and longer) ads, with similar pricing ‚Äì especially considering the challenge of consistently producing effective 5-second ads. = Annoyance factors that influence ad avoidance = * Perceived intrusiveness * Perceived informativeness * Ad utilities * High-pressure advertising (hard sell, as contrasted by soft sell) * Questionable and polarized advertising, including pharmaceuticals (patent medicine, including off-label use), firearms, political campaigns, tobacco  Annoying albeit effective ads  Some ads are deliberately annoying. Some are cute or funny, but, for some, wear thin over time. \\"Memorable, but not always effective\\" North America : Mascots * The Aflac Duck * The Band, FreeCreditScore.com * Betty White, Snickers * Dusty the Dusthole, Clark County, Nevada * Energizer Bunny * Erin Esurance * Flo ‚Äì \\"weirdly sincere,\\" Progressive * Go-Gurt independent child, Yoplait * The King, Burger King * Foghorn Leghorn, as used by GEICO * GEICO gecko * GEICO Cavemen * HeadOn * Kia Soul Hamsters * Mayhem, Allstate * * Mr. Opportunity, Honda * Mr. Six, Six Flags  Peggy, Discover Card * Poppin' Fresh, Pillsbury : Jingles * \\"Jingles and Chimes,\\" Mister Softee : (audio via YouTube) : Phrases *  Exhibit of an annoyance factor analysis table  Factor analysis of perceptual items and attitude measures in online advertising: Academicians Kelli S. Burns, PhD, and Richard J. Lutz, PhD, surveyed online users in 2002. In doing so, they chose six online ad formats: (i) banners, (ii) pop-ups, (iii) floating ads, (iv) skyscrapers, (v) large rectangles, and (vi) interstitials. To develop perceptual factors, ratings of the 15 perceptual items for all six on-line ad formats were run through principal components analysis with varimax rotation. The authors inferred ‚Äì from a scree plot ‚Äì a possible three-factor solution. The first three factors accounted for over 68% of the total variance. The remaining 12 reflected no more than 5% of the variance, each. The first of the seven tables in their paper, Table 1 (below), shows the loadings of the factors generated through principal component extraction and varimax rotation. {width=\\"100%\\" border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" style=\\"border:0px solid #A3B1BF;

Other names include the black stink-roach, black stink cockroach, black coackroach and te papata pango. It is well-known for the defensive chemical produced when disturbed. Description Maoriblatta novaeseelandiae is a large cockroach (25-29 mm long) with a glossy black integument. Its legs are dark red and antennae brown at the base, becoming lighter coloured towards the apices. Its dorsal surface is covered in fine punctures. It is the largest endemic cockroach in New Zealand. This cockroach is flightless. The holotype specimen is stored in Naturhistorisches Museum, Vienna. Distribution and habitat Maoriblatta novaeseelandiae in forest habitat This species is found in native lowland forests throughout the North Island and in coastal regions of northern areas of the South Island. Collection records exist from the Three Kings Islands in the north to Kaikoura in the south. Its altitudinal range is from sea level to 600 m on the North Island. It is found among grasses and beneath rotten logs, stones and debris, where it eats decaying plant material. They are usually nocturnal, hiding behind tree bark, under stones or logs during the day. Defence This species of cockroach has a defensive behaviour of releasing an opaque yellow- coloured liquid from a scent gland that is located inside the abdomen. It will use this defence if handled or disturbed from its retreat. The liquid is secreted from an opening between the sixth and seventh sternites. The gland only produces the chemical defence in adult cockroaches. Research has shown that predators including weka, pukeko and mice are effectively repelled by the scent produced by Maoriblatta novaeseelandiae.

The aircraft was delivered to the United States Army Air Forces in May of 1945 as B-17G 44-85813. It was leased to Curtiss- Wright and modified as a JB-17G engine testbed. The airframe was used to test the XT-35 Typhoon turboprop, and the Wright J65 jet engine among others. The Ewing Aviation Company acquired the aircraft in 1966 and owned it until 1969 when it was owned by Ewing-Kolb Aircraft until 1970. Black Hills Aviation, owned by Arnold Kolb, then purchased the aircraft. In the late 1960s the forward engine mount was removed and the aircraft was converted into an aerial firefighter in Spearfish, South Dakota. It was used as a firefighter until 1980, when it crashed at Bear Penn, North Carolina. Remains from the aircraft were used to restore Liberty Belle. In 2005, what remained of the aircraft was bought by the Champaign Aviation Museum. In conjunction with parts from several other airframes, restoration to flying condition began. In 2011, the Champaign Aviation Museum recovered parts from Talkeetna, Alaska to aid in the restoration. In 2013 nearly 90 volunteers had spent seven years restoring the B-17 at the museum and repaired around 70% of the fuselage.

Barracouta was paid off in August 1786, but recommissioned in September by Lieutenant Robert Barlow for Rame Head and the Cornish coast. He cruised with great success against smugglers until he was promoted to the rank of Commander in 1790, and soon after appointed to the brig with orders to resume his former station on the coast of Cornwall.

The movement consisted of various anti-poverty and community organizations in New York City, including Metropolitan Council on Housing. It was an early example of New York City squatter activism, which strengthened in the 1980s, and helped publicize tenant rights. The movement primarily consisted of African- American and Latino activists, who were opposed to the eviction of working- class and poor tenants from their homes. These removals were rooted in efforts to gentrify neighborhoods, in a collaborative effort between city agencies, real estate developers, and banks. In response, the movement organized a coordinated take-over of nine vacant buildings in the summer of 1970. The buildings were slated for demolition, and they were located in Ninth Avenue (Columbus Avenue) and West 80th Street in Manhattan. This was followed by the coordinated take-over of buildings in Morningside Heights, which had been reserved for private development. The activists claimed that they had the right to squat in the properties, and that they could better identify how to use the spaces than government or business entities. They also demanded that new, high-rise buildings designate more units to low-income residents. The squatter rights movement helped launch El Comit√©, a Puerto Rican left-wing organization. Some spaces claimed by Operation Move-In activists were transformed into low-income cooperatives in the 1980s, enacted through the Tenant Interim Lease Program.

The school operated in Ocala from 1853 until 1861. After being closed during the Civil War, the school re-opened in Gainesville, Florida in 1866.  Early years in Ocala  In 1851, the Florida Legislature authorized the establishment of two \\"seminaries of learning\\", one to serve residents of counties to the east of the Suwannee River, and the other to serve residents of counties to the west of that river. Each county could send a number of students tuition-free to the appropriate seminary equal to the number of representatives sent from that county to the State Assembly. Alachua and Marion counties each petitioned the state to host the new seminary for eastern Florida. Alachua County offered $5,000 for the construction of buildings for the school. Marion County offered $1,600, land worth $5,000, and the existing buildings of the East Florida Independent Institute, a private school founded in 1852. In 1852 the legislature picked Ocala, in Marion County, as the site for the East Florida Seminary. The East Florida Seminary opened in 1853, and in its first year had four teachers and about 60 students. The school admitted male and female students, and the curriculum included \\"all routine subjects\\", as well as art, Greek and Latin. Marion County did not provide any support for public education until 1857, and the Seminary, a few private schools, and tutors on some plantations were the only educational opportunities in the county. In 1858 the Seminary had 65 students. The school closed in 1861. It has been reported that all of the male faculty and students left the school to participate in the Civil War.  The other East Florida Seminary  In 1852, prior to the establishment of the state sponsored East Florida Seminary in Ocala, another school called the East Florida Seminary, associated with the Florida Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, was established in Micanopy, Florida, in southern Alachua County. While most members of the Board of Trustees were Methodist clergy, there is no evidence that the conference ever assumed control of or provided any funding for the school. The school was explicitly described as \\"a 'literary' and not a 'theological' institution\\", that would not be teaching \\"Methodism\\". A two- story classroom building was erected. At one point the school had three teachers, which were later reduced to two. In 1855 the school had about 30 students, but the teachers had not been paid for a year. The school struggled on, closing in 1860. The citizens of Alachua County unsuccessfully petitioned the Florida Senate in 1856 to move the state-funded East Florida Seminary to Micanopy.  Gainesville  East Florida Seminary in 1891. Epworth Hall is on the left, with the dormitory in the middle and right The East Florida Seminary did not reopen in Ocala after the end of the Civil War, and in 1866 the Florida Legislature passed an act moving the school to Gainesville. The Seminary was primarily a local public school for the next twenty years, with students mainly from Gainesville, ranging in age from four to twenty-four. Few students from other counties took advantage of the free tuition seats available, as the state tuition grants did not cover room and board. The wooden building used by the East Florida Seminary, described as \\"badly designed and poorly constructed\\", burned in 1883. The voters of Gainesville approved a bond issue that year to fund improvements at the Seminary and the Union Academy, which served African-American students in Gainesville. The Seminary received $6,000 from the bond issue, which was used on construction of a new two-story brick Academic Building. That building was used in 1905 by the newly organized University of Florida until buildings could be constructed on its new campus west of Gainesville. The building was deeded in 1911 to what is now the First United Methodist Church of Gainesville, and is now known as Epworth Hall. Wooden barracks or dormitory building for the East Florida Seminary The East Florida Seminary began awarding diplomas for completion of the English, commercial, classical and scientific courses in 1882. The seminary had a normal department for training teachers until the state created the Florida State Normal School in 1887. Starting in 1883 the Seminary had a military organization, with a training officer supplied by the U.S. Army. In 1886, the Florida Legislature appropriated $10,000 for the construction of a wooden dormitory (also called a barracks) at the Seminary, and $1,000 each for the years 1887 and 1888 to supplement the funds available from the Seminary Fund for the operation of the Seminary. In 1885 the State of Florida paid Ocala $5,400 to settle claims for the money spent to provide facilities for the East Florida Seminary in 1853, in compensation for the school being moved to Gainesville in 1866. The East Florida Seminary was \\"thoroughly graded\\" in 1887. The lower age limit was raised, and there were no students under the age of thirteen enrolled in the school by 1889. By that year, the Seminary was functioning as a preparatory school. The Seminary library had between 800 and 1,000 books. Of the 28 counties in Florida east of the Suwannee River, 21 had students at the Seminary.

As its name suggests, it supported re- establishing serfdom in Russia, after the Emancipation Reform of 1861. The party's history is relatively limited to the late 1800s, and for the most part it served as a target of derision by liberal, progressive, or socialist reformers. History After the Emancipation of serfs in Russia, Alexander II began to have serious doubts about his course. After suffering a backlash from the Russian aristocracy for his act, Alexander II moved to the right, and began to replace progressive, government administrators with members from Kryepostniki. Ministers of the Interior and War (the Milyutin brothers, Nikolay Milyutin and Dmitry Milyutin) were replaced, and a whole series of government bureaus were emptied and restacked with Kryepostniki, for instance, the Liberal Emancipation Committees were replaced. The Kryepostniki are known to represent \\"a vast majority of the gentry owners of Russia‚Äôs 111,555 estates.\\" While some have advocated outright serfdom, the key-issue they advocated was a \\"Baltic model\\" of serf-emancipation, specifically where the serfs would be freed, but without any significant land being redistributed to them. The party was known for its very vocal press, which made endless complaints about the lack of \\"hands\\" available for the estates of the nobility, as well as advocating for a number of things: abolishing the mir (the village community), abolishing justices of the peace (popularly- controlled judicial system), and establishing a \\"nobility bank,\\" in which the government would give interest-free loans to the rich. Herbert Spencer criticized the party by saying \\"the reality is that few landlords care to cultivate their estates...[the landlord's wealth] have been squandered in maintaining the old standard of living...\\" Legacy The famous author, Vera Broido, remembers the history of the Emancipation Act, with all of its reactionary rigor, and reflected that it satisfied nobody, \\"not even the Kryepostniki.\\" References Category:Serfdom ","title":"Party of Return to Serfdom"},{"id":"62337137","title":"Bayhan G√ºrhan"},{"id":"62337163","text":"James Norman Spuhler (March 1, 1917 ‚Äì September 2, 1992) was an American biological anthropologist who has been described as \\"the founder of anthropological genetics\\". He taught at the University of New Mexico from 1967 to 1984, where his research focused on human genetics. In 1990, he received the NAS Award for Scientific Reviewing. He died of cancer at his home in Santa Fe, New Mexico, on September 2, 1992.  Background  James Spuhler began his education at the University of New Mexico. He started at the university on a football scholarship, but gave up his scholarship to focus on his education. After he graduated, he was sent to China because of World War 2. While in China he served as a Naval officer and learned to speak some Chinese and Japanese. When he returned from the war he started at Harvard University to be trained in physical anthropology. While studying at Harvard he wrote his dissertation on human genetics, which was one of the first of this topic submitted to any Department of Anthropology in the United States. While he was at Harvard, genetic knowledge was not used in relation to human populations as Spuhler was the first to be trained in this field. His dissertation prevented information for his two different subjects of expertise: human genetics and physical anthropology. Following his Ph. D he worked as an instructor at the Ohio State University in the Department of Anthropology and Sociology. Spuhler became a reviewer but never worked full time because he continued to do research in the field and laboratory.  Research  The first study we contributed to was one of his teachers, Clyde Kluckhohn. Spuhler suggested a strategy of studying the nine genetic traits of the Ramah Navaho. The nine traits included in the study were a secrater factor of saliva, PTC taste reaction, anterior thoracic venus patterns, color perceptions, occipital hair whorl, absence of peroneus teritus muscles, and the number of vallate papillae on the tongue. His next project was a study of racial-ethnic differences in IQ. This study was completed during the academic year of 1971-1972 at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences in Palo Alto, California. He and other scholars cooperatively researched the genetic and environmental variations that would account for the racial-ethnic differences in IQ. The results of the study stated that the environmental and genetic differences will not always occur. After this study was completed he was hired as a chair of the Department of Anthropology at the University of Michigan. He started the first two courses with a focus of genetic anthropology in the United States, which influenced further teaching of biological anthropology. The two courses were called \\" The Genetic Basis of Evolution\\" and \\"Population Genetics\\".  Rewards  In 1990 James Spuhler was awarded the Award of Excellence for Scientific Reviewing by the National Academy of Sciences. He was given this award for his reviews that used population genetics that study anthropological questions. There were a wide array of study topics including race, intelligence, language, relationships among species, and human evolution. Spuhler explains that he writes for the \\"general scientific public, whether citizen or professional.\\" Over 700 publications have cited his work.

It runs from H. C. Andersens Boulevard in the northeast to Kvlgtorvgade at the Meat-Packing District in the southwest, linking Stormgade in the city centre with Halmtorvet and S√∏nder Boulevard in Vesterbro. The street follows the rear side of Tivoli Gardens and Copenhagen Central Station. The viaduct that carries it across the railway tracks at the central station is known as Tietgensbro (Tietgen's Bridge). A series of staircases and lifts provides direct access from the viaduct to the station platforms. History The street seen on a detail from a drawing by [Franz [Saive from 1897. Dantes Plads is visible in the upper left corner and a lumberyard can be seen in the bottom right corner Tietgensgade was created after the southern part of Copenhagen's West Rampart, from the city's haymarket (now City Hall Square) to the harbourfront, had finally been removed in the early 1880s. The street was then a direct continuation of Ny Vestergade and was therefore initially called Ny Vestergades Fprl√¶ngelse (Ny Vestergade's Extension). The trapezoid shape of Dantes Plads reflects how Ny Vestergade used to curve around the right-hand side of the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek. A social shooting event at Enighedsv√¶rn seen on an illustration from Illustreret Tidende' The far end of the street was initially dominated by extensive storage yards for timber and firewood. The country house Enighedsv√¶rn was also located in that end of the street. The building was taken over by the city and used as an annex school under the schools in Gasv√¶rksvej and Matth√¶usgade. The street was renamed Tietgensgade in 1904 to commemorate Carl Frederik Tietgen who had died a few years earlier. The transfer of a narrow strip of Tivoli Gardens and the subsequent demolition of the Arena Theatre in 1906 made it possible to connect the street to Stormgade, creating a more straight route through the inner city. On 30 November 1911, Copenhagen Central Station was inaugurated on a site next to Tivoli Gardens. Its predecessor had been located on the other side of the street. Notable buildings No. 31: Rudolph Bergh's Hospital The former West Hospital (No. 31), later renamed Rudolph Berg's Hospital after its founder, Rudolph Bergh, is from 1885. The building was designed by Vilhelm Petersen, The former Western Power Station (Vestre Elektricitetsv√¶rk), built in 1896-98 for K√∏benhavns Belysningsv√¶sen after the design by Ludvig Fenger, was one of the first power plants in Copenhagen. The disused plant has been converted into a district cooling plant and administration office for HOFOR, Greater Copenhagen‚Äôs largest utility company. No. 35-39: Copenhagen Central Post Building Copenhagen Central Post Building (No. 35-39) was built as new headquarters for the Danish Post and Telegraph Company and later taken over by Post Danmark. The building is now under conversion into an upscale hotel. The Baroque Revival style building was designed by Heinrich Wenck, who also designed the Central Station, and completed in 1912. No. 74: Rysensteen Gymnasium The Tivoli Concert Hall (No. 20) is from 1953 and was designed by Frits Schlegel and Hans Hansen. It predecessor, a concert hall from 1802 designed by Knud Arne Petersen in \\"Moorish style\\", was destroyed by schalburgtage in World War II. The new concert hall was expanded by 3XN in 2006. DGI-Byen (No. 65), located at the corner of Tietgensgade and Ingerslevsgade, is a sports and swimming centre which opened in 2000. The building was designed by Schmidt Hammer Lassen Architects. Rysensteen Gymnasium (No. 74, located at the corner with Kv√¶gtorvsgade, is an upper- secondary school. The building is from ¬Ω886 and was designed by Hans J√∏rgen Holm who also designed the first stage of the Livestock Market on the other side of Kv√¶gtorvsgade. The school was founded in 1850 and was originally located in Stormgade and Rysenstensgade.

It is notable for being one of the few titles by Toaplan that has not received any official port to home consoles as of date. In the game, players assume the role of Pipi and Bibi attempting to place time bombs in buildings filled with enemies who appear from behind closed doors and escape before the location collapses. As of 2019, the rights to Pipi & Bibi's is owned by Tatsujin, a company founded in 2017 by former Toaplan member Masahiro Yuge and now- affiliate of Japanese arcade manufacturer exA-Arcadia alongside many other IPs from the defunct studio.  Gameplay  Gameplay screenshot. Pipi & Bibi's is an eroge action-platform game reminiscent of Elevator Action, where the players assume the role of Pipi (P1) and Bibi (P2) entering a series of six increasingly difficult buildings composed of four stages filled with enemies in order to set up time bombs on computer rooms and exit from the area before it collapses from the explosion as the main objective to reveal the picture of a woman.Whoopee!! arcade flyer (Toaplan, JP) For each stage completed, 1/4 of a woman's picture is shown and the full picture is revealed once all four stages of a building are cleared. Getting hit by an enemy will result in losing a live and once all lives are lost, the game is over unless the players insert more credits into the arcade machine to continue playing. Along the way, players can defend against enemies by shooting their laser beam weapon and depending how long the beam is held on, enemies will fall off to the platform below or out the playfield but they respawn from behind closed doors. Players traverse the stages through stairs and elevators, which can also be used by enemies as well. The player characters can also perform a sliding kick when the elevator door are opening or closing and this tactic can also be used to defeat enemies. On occasions, an \\"H\\" coin appears to be collected and depending on the number of coins collected before clearing all four stages, the woman on the picture takes more of her clothes. After setting up the time bombs, players only have twenty seconds to exit before the bombs detonate but if the players characters are hit by an enemy, the area collapses but players are forced to clear the stage once again.  Development and release  Pipi & Bibi's was released on arcades worldwide by Toaplan and Nova Apparate GMBH & Co. in 1991. The soundtrack was composed by Osamu ≈åta, although he is not credited as such in the game. On 25 April 2018, an album containing music from the title, as well as Snow Bros. and its sequel was published exclusively in Japan by City Connection under their Clarice Disk label.  Reception and legacy  In Japan, Game Machine listed Pipi & Bibi's on their May 1, 1992 issue as being the ninthtenth most-successful table arcade unit of the year, outperforming titles such as WWF WrestleFest and Columns. Spanish gaming magazine Microman√≠a gave an overall mixed outlook to the game. In more recent years, the rights to Pipi & Bibi's and many other IPs from Toaplan are now owned by Tatsujin, a company named after Truxton's Japanese title that was founded in 2017 by former Toaplan employee Masahiro Yuge, who are now affiliated with arcade manufacturer exA-Arcadia.
