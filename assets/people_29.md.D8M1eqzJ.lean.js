Germany Bahnpolizei was the name of the former Railway police of West Germany and fell under the jurisdiction of the Deutsche Bundesbahn federal railway company. Bahnpolizei officers investigated trespassing on rail property, assaults against passengers, terrorism threats targeting the railway, arson, tagging of graffiti on railroad rolling stock or buildings, signal vandalism, pickpocketing, ticket fraud, robbery and theft of personal belongings, baggage or freight. They also investigated train/vehicle collisions and hazardous materials releases. In 1992 the railway security mission was transferred to the Bundesgrenzschutz which resulted in the merger of the Bahnpolizei into the Federal Border Guard Force. The BGS had already taken on these duties in 1990 for the territory of the former East Germany, replacing the former East German Transportpolizei. The Bundesgrenzschutz was then renamed the Bundespolizei (Federal Police) on July 1, 2005, and this force is currently responsible for security and passenger checks on the German railway system. Switzerland Switzerland never had a separate transport police because all rail employees had limited police authority. However, due to the introduction of trains with no conductors in the late 1990s, crime in trains increased and the Swiss Federal Railways rail company trained Bahnpolizei officers for its driver-only commuter trains. In 2002 the SBB-CFF-FFS merged its Bahnpolizei force with the private security company Securitas AG and the resulting Securitrans is now the force that protects Switzerland's trains, passengers, rail property and rail workers. Since 2011, the rail police has been reorganised, and the Transport Police of Switzerland (Transportpolizei) are state employees, with all officers attending two years of police academy training with final certification. Transportpolizei officers are sworn as officers to the Swiss Confederation, and thus have the same power to arrest as any other cantonal police officers. As their state counterparts, they usually carry a SIG Sauer P225 and pepper sprays as weapons, along with handcuffs for restrain options.

A man born to love her. A timeless moment in a world gone mad.\\" Giovanna (Sophia Loren) and Antonio (Marcello Mastroianni) marry to delay Antonio's deployment during World War II. After that buys them twelve days of happiness, they try another scheme, in which Antonio pretends to be a crazy man. Finally, Antonio is sent to the Russian Front. When the war is over, Antonio does not return and is listed as missing in action. Despite the odds, Giovanna is convinced her true love has survived the war and is still in the Soviet Union. Determined, she journeys to the Soviet Union to find him. In the Soviet Union, Giovanna visits the sunflower fields, where there is supposedly one flower for each fallen Italian soldier, and where the Germans forced the Italians to dig their own mass graves. Eventually, Giovanna finds Antonio, but by now he has started a second family with a woman who saved his life, and they have one daughter. Childless, having been faithful to her husband, Giovanna returns to Italy, heartbroken, but unwilling to disrupt her love's new life. Some years later, Antonio returns to Giovanna, asking her to come back with him to the Soviet Union. Meanwhile, Giovanna has tried to move on with her own life, moving out of their first home together and into her own apartment.

As they part, Antonio gives her a fur, which he had promised years before that he'd bring back for her. The lovers lock eyes as Antonio's train takes him away from Giovanna, and from Italy, forever.

Turtledove wrote a sequel, a short story entitled \\"Herbig-Haro\\". Plot summary The story is told through limited third person point of view, with most of the story concerning a single Roxolani captain, Togram. During a routine journey of conquest, they happen upon Earth. The Roxolani anticipate a simple and rewarding campaign, as they can detect no use of gravity manipulation, the cornerstone of their civilization. Humanity is awed by the invaders, as the maneuverability granted by that technology suggests the rest of their civilization is equally impressive. But as they begin their assault, things take a turn for the absurdthe Roxolani attack with matchlock weapons and black powder explosives. Humans retaliate with automatic weapons and missiles. The battle is short, and most of the invaders are killed. A few are captured alive. When they are interrogated, the truth becomes evident: the method of manipulating gravity is absurdly simple, and species like the Roxolani are thus able to use faster than light travel with relatively primitive technological sophistication. This enabled them to engage in wars of conquest on a galactic scale. However, adopting the technology allowing for interstellar travel (and wars of conquest on a galactic scale) stifles further technological development as all the creative energies of societies that find it go into perfecting it. In contrast, humanity somehow missed developing gravity technology and advanced further technologically. As Togram and another Roxolani captive realize that they have now given a far more advanced civilization the means to easily conquer countless worlds, the story closes with the two asking themselves, \\"What have we done?\\" Publication history The story was first published in Analog Science Fiction in 1985. It is a prequel story to \\"Herbig-Haro\\"set several centuries after humanity has conquered the galaxy published a year before under the name \\"Eric Iverson\\". This short story contains ideas which were later more developed in the Worldwar series, in which the invading aliens have an initial technological edge that is soon surpassed by human ingenuity and innovation.

CABALA? QABALAH? from Jewish kabbalaonline.org), also spelled Cabbala. Interest grew among some Christian scholars in the mystical aspects of Jewish Kabbalah, which they interpreted under their Christian theology.  Background  The movement was influenced by a desire to interpret aspects of Christianity even more mystically than current Christian mystics. Greek Neoplatonic documents came into Europe from Constantinople in the reign of Mehmet II. Neoplatonism had been prevalent in Christian Europe and had entered into Scholasticism since the translation of Greek and Hebrew texts in Spain in the 13th century. The Renaissance trend was a relatively short-lived phenomenon, ending by 1750. Christian Kabbalah \\"reinterpreted Kabbalistic doctrine to a distinctly Christian perspective, linking Jesus Christ, His atonement, and His resurrection to the Ten Sefirot\\", linking the upper three Sephirot to the hypostases of the Trinity and the last seven \\"to the lower or earthly world\\",Walter Martin, Jill Martin Rische, Kurt van Gorden: The Kingdom of the Occult.

First edition, second printing 2004. St. Paul, MN: Llewellyn Publications 2004, p. 50, accessed on 28 March 2013. Christian Cabalists sought to transform Kabbalah into \\"a dogmatic weapon to turn back against the Jews to compel their conversion‚Äîstarting with Ramon Llull\\", whom Harvey J. Hames called \\"the first Christian to acknowledge and appreciate kabbalah as a tool of conversion\\", though Llull was not a Kabbalist himself nor versed in Kabbalah.Don Karr: The Study of Christian Cabala in English (pdf), p. 1, accessed on 28 March 2013. Later Christian Kabbalah is mostly based on Pico della Mirandola, Johann Reuchlin and Paolo Riccio.Walter Martin, Jill Martin Rische, Kurt van Gorden: The Kingdom of the Occult. Nashville: Thomas Nelson 2008, p. 150, accessed on 28 March 2013. After the 18th century, Kabbalah became blended with European occultism, some of which had a religious basis; but the main interest in Christian Kabbalah was by then dead. A few attempts have been made to revive it in recent decades, particularly regarding the Neoplatonism of the first two chapters of the Gospel of John, but it has not entered into mainstream Christianity.  Medieval precursors  = Raymond Llull = The Franciscan Ramon Llull (ca. 1232-1316) was \\"the first Christian to acknowledge and appreciate kabbalah as a tool of conversion\\", although he was \\"not a Kabbalist, nor was he versed in any particular Kabbalistic approach\\". Not interested in the possibilities of scholarly Jewish influence, which began later in the Renaissance, his reading of new interpretations of Kabbalah was solely for the sake of theological debate with religious Jews; i.e., missionizing. = Spanish conversos = An early expression of Christian Kabbalah was among the Spanish conversos from Judaism, from the late 13th century to the Expulsion from Spain of 1492. These include Abner of Burgos and Pablo de Heredia. Heredia's \\"Epistle of Secrets\\" is \\"the first recognizable work of Christian Kabbalah\\", and was quoted by Pietro Galatino who influenced Athanasius Kircher. However, Heredia's Kabbalah consists of quotes from non- existent Kabbalistic works, and distorted or fake quotes from real Kabbalistic sources.Don Karr: The Study of Christian Cabala in English (pdf), p. 2f, accessed on 28 March 2013.  Christian Kabbalists  = Pico della Mirandola = Among the first to promote aspects of Kabbalah beyond exclusively Jewish circles was Giovanni Pico della Mirandola (1463‚Äì1494)Christian Cabala , accessed on 15 February 2013. a student of Marsilio Ficino at his Florentine Academy. His syncretic world-view combined Platonism, Neoplatonism, Aristotelianism, Hermeticism and Kabbalah. Mirandola's work on Kabbalah was further developed by Athanasius Kircher (1602‚Äì1680), a Jesuit priest, Hermeticist and polymath; in 1652, Kircher wrote on the subject in Oedipus Aegyptiacus. = Johann Reuchlin = Title of Reuchlin's De arte cabalistica libri tres, iam denua adcurate revisi, 1530. Johann Reuchlin, a Catholic humanist (1455‚Äì1522), was \\"Pico's most important follower\\".Don Karr: The Study of Christian Cabala in English (pdf), p. 6, accessed on 28 March 2013. His main sources for Kabbalah were Menahem Recanati (Commentary on the Torah, Commentary on the Daily Prayers) and Joseph Gikatilla (Sha'are Orah, Ginnat 'Egoz).Don Karr: The Study of Christian Cabala in English (pdf), p. 16, accessed on 28 March 2013. Reuchlin argued that human history divides into three periods: a natural period in which God revealed Himself as Shaddai (◊©◊ì◊ô), the period of the Torah in which God \\"revealed Himself to Moses through the four-lettered name of the Tetragrammaton\\" (◊ô◊î◊ï◊î), and the period of Christian spiritual rule of the earth which is known in Christianity as \\"the redemption.\\" It was asserted that the five-letter name associated with this period is an altered version of the tetragrammaton with the additional letter shin (◊©).Walter Martin, Jill Martin Rische, Kurt van Gorden: The Kingdom of the Occult. Nashville: Thomas Nelson 2008, p. 149, accessed on 28 March 2013. This name, Yahshuah (◊ô◊î◊©◊ï◊î for 'Jesus'), is also known as the pentagrammaton. It is an attempt by Christian theologians to read the name of the Christian deity into The unpronounced name of the Jewish God. The first of Reuchlin's two books on Kabbalah, De verbo mirifico, \\"speaks of the [‚Ä¶] name of Jesus derived from the tetragrammaton\\".

In 1598-1599, Walther undertook a pilgrimage to the Holy Land to learn about the intricacies of the Kabbalah and Jewish mysticism from groups in Safed and elsewhere, including amongst the followers of Isaac Luria. However, he did not follow the teachings of these Jewish authorities but later used his learning to further Christian theological pursuits. Despite his claim to have spent six years in these travels, it appears that he only made several shorter trips. Walther himself did not author any significant works of Christian Kabbalah but maintained a voluminous manuscript collection of magical and kabbalistic works. His significance for the history of Christian Kabbalah is that his ideas and doctrines exercised a profound influence on the works of the German theosopher, Jakob B√∂hme, in particular B√∂hme's Forty Questions on the Soul (c.1621).Leigh T.I.

Plot Natale, an apprentice bricklayer, and Luisa, who has no marketable skill, marry and try to live with Natale's parents and other relatives in one apartment, what might happen in the poorest classes in Rome about 1950. After a quarrel Natale and Luisa precipitately leave without a place to live. The remainder of the film is devoted to their finding housing. The solution is building a one-room brick dwelling as a squat on unused railway land on the outskirts of Rome. As it was illegal, Natale arranges his workmates to assist him during the night. According to the rules, if a dwelling has a door and a roof the householder cannot be evicted. At dawn when the police arrive to remove them the dwelling is complete except for part of the roof, but a humane policeman looks the other way. The happy ending is not without realism. In financial straits, and facing imprisonment later, Natale and Luisa, now pregnant, will encounter difficulties ahead. \\"[The Roof] is a confirmation of the power of neorealist principles ...

It lies on the north side of the Severn Estuary approximately 5 miles (8 kilometres) from the Welsh border at Chepstow and is surrounded by woodland and agricultural land. Development of the village There are plans to develop the dairy into a small housing development. Recent developments have consolidated rather than expanded the village. If you travel north west from Netherend you pass a Methodist church, then 'Birchwood Road', leading to a housing estate, the 'Ring Fence' a small lane with a number of cottages along it, the 'Rising Sun' one of the village's two public houses and the village allotments. Woolaston Common is about 1 mile from the main A48 road and north of the main village. Here there is a small hamlet of houses and an area of common ground which, for the most part of the year, is covered in bracken. Adjoining the common is also another hamlet called Sandtumps. Governance The village falls in the 'Hewelsfield and Woolaston' electoral ward. This ward stretches from Brockweir in the north east to Woolaston. The total population of the ward taken at the 2011 census was 1,690.  St. Andrew's Church  St. Andrew's parish church at Woolaston is about a mile south west of Netherend along the A48 towards Chepstow. The earliest record of its existence is in 1131. However, the old circular churchyard and the nearby Roman road, which ran just to the north-west of the church, suggest a much earlier holy site. The Tower was originally a low one with a short wooden steeple, but following the granting of a faculty in 1774, it was completely rebuilt. It was threatened with closure in 2007 but at the final Midnight Mass on Christmas Eve it was announced the Church will be saved. Stroat Church and ruined Bible Christian chapel Stroat Church (previously known as Stroat Mission) is located three miles out of Woolaston on the A48 towards Chepstow. It has been involved in the village of Woolaston for over 120 years. Its history began with Squire Morgan and his family in the 1880s. They were evangelical Anglicans with a deep concern for the people of the Parish of Tidenham and in particular for those living in Woodcroft and, these being the distinctly rural areas where they most felt a need to evangelise. Scattered though the community was, the work they embarked upon at Woodcroft prospered. People came to worship from a wide area by whatever means they could, but mostly on foot or by horse and cart. Today the car has replaced the cart but the countryside is still much as it was back then. It was in 1889 that the Morgans bought a plot of ground at Stroat and in that same year erected a corrugated iron building that soom became known as the Iron Room. As the years rolled on Stroat became independent of Woodcoft, continuing to bring the Gospel to all within its own neighbourhood. Among those who came to the Iron Room were many young people who seemed to enjoy just being there. In 1950 the Reverend W Hill and his wife were appointed to lead the work at Stroat and under their ministry it flourished and the Church continued to grow. After seven years, however, Rev Hill moved on. By then the Church had become known as Stroat Mission and in 1957 a new Minister was appointed, the Reverend Leslie Musgrove. There is a derelict Bible Christian chapel, built in 1836, on Woodside Road, near its junction with Slade Road.

Effect of the Act By this Act, an oath was imposed, which besides a declaration of loyalty to the reigning sovereign, contained an abjuration of the Pretender, and of certain doctrines attributed to Roman Catholics, such as that excommunicated princes may lawfully be murdered, that no faith should be kept with heretics, and that the Pope had temporal as well as spiritual jurisdiction in Great Britain.List of oath-takers under the 1778 Act Those taking this oath were exempted from some of the provisions of the Popery Act 1698. Although it did not grant freedom of worship, it allowed Catholics to join the army and purchase land if they took an oath of allegiance.\\"Catholic Relief Acts\\", Parliament UK The section as to taking and prosecuting priests was repealed, as well as the penalty of perpetual imprisonment for keeping a school.

The four original subzones created in 1988 are Artesa, to the northeast of Lleida, Valls de Riucorb to the east, Garrigues and Ra√Ømat. In 1998 two other subzones were added: Pallars Juss√†, next to the town of Tremp, 90 km north of Lleida and Segri√† to the west and surrounded by the Raimat subzone. Climate The climate is continental (hot summers and cold winters), influenced by the proximity of the Pyrenees, though rainfall is sparse. Average rainfall is around 450 mm though 300 mm is common in the west. Average annual temperature is 15¬∞C (max 35¬∞C in summer, minimum below zero in winter). There are also extreme variations between daytime and night-time temperatures all year. Drought, hailstones and spring frosts are occasional risks for the vineyards. Soils Even though the vineyards are dispersed geographically, most are on dark lime bearing soils, with a high lime content, low clay content and poor in organic matter. Height varies between 250 m and 700 m above sea level. Authorised Grape Varieties The authorised grape varieties are: * Red: Garnatxa Negra, Ull de llebre, Trepat, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Monastrell / Garrut, Sumoll, Syrah, Mazuela / Sams√≥, Pinot Noir, Cabernet Franc, Garnatxa Tintorera, Petit Verdot, and Malbec * White: Macabeu, Xarel¬∑lo, Parellada, Chardonnay, Garnatxa Blanca, Riesling, Sauvignon Blanc, Moscatell d‚ÄôAlexandria, Malvasia / Subirat Parent, Gewurztraminer, Albarinho, Chenin, Viognier, Verdejo, and Godello The older vines grow as low bushes (en vaso), while the more recently planted ones are on trellises (en espaldera) so as to allow mechanisation of vineyards activities. Maximum authorised planting density is 2,500 vines/ha. The vineyards in the west of the province use irrigation systems to mitigate the effects of the cold and the heat.

The regiment fought with the Army of the Cumberland in numerous battles, including Stones River, Chickamauga, and Missionary Ridge. Regimental history Colonel William L. Stoughton The regiment was recruited in southern Michigan between April and September 1861, with the majority of the soldiers coming from St. Joseph County. The unit formally mustered into the Union army between August 24 and September 11. It formed independent from the state government, as allowed for by the War Department, but fell under Michigan‚Äôs control when the Federal authorization for independent units was revoked. The regiment received its formal designation as the 11th regiment on October 11. The soldiers elected their officers, selecting William J. May, the former proprietor of the White Pigeon Railroad Dining Hall, as colonel. U.S. district attorney William Lewis Stoughton, a rising star in the Republican Party, was elected lieutenant colonel.Faust, 11th Michigan, 7, 10-11, 15-17, 19. The 11th Michigan trained at White Pigeon before deploying to Kentucky on December 9, 1861, with 1,004 men and officers. Far from the front lines, the unit saw little active service, but suffered dearly from smallpox and measles at Bardstown, Kentucky that winter, losing more than seventy men to disease. Colonel May, suffering from poor health, resigned effective April 1, raising Stoughton to colonel in his place. Melvin Mudge was promoted to fill the vacancy at lieutenant colonel.Faust, 11th Michigan, 27, 32-37, 42-43. The Michiganders went on railroad guard duty in March 1862 as the Union army advanced into Tennessee following Ulysses S. Grant‚Äôs captures of Forts Henry and Donelson. The regiment‚Äôs first taste of active military operations came when Confederate cavalryman John Hunt Morgan launched a raid through Tennessee and Kentucky in July. The 11th regiment, in conjunction with other Federal units, was dispatched on a wild goose chase that culminated in a narrow miss at surrounding Morgan‚Äôs entire force at Paris, Kentucky. The regiment, in conjunction with other units, later caught up with a detachment of Morgan‚Äôs troopers at Gallatin, Tennessee, on August 13, 1862, firing the first volleys in the regiment‚Äôs history. The Michiganders claimed to have inflicted numerous casualties on Morgan‚Äôs force, though Morgan‚Äôs subordinate Basil Duke (who was not present) later denied any Confederate losses. The Michiganders and their Federal counterparts pillaged Gallatin while there, embittering Morgan and hardening his attitude toward Union civilians.Faust, 11th Michigan, 40-42, 55-59. Braxton Bragg‚Äôs Confederate invasion of Kentucky in August 1862 left the 11th Michigan among the Federal units stranded in isolation at Nashville under the command of James Scott Negley. The 11th was finally brigaded at this time, joining the 19th Illinois Infantry, the 18th Ohio Infantry, and the 69th Ohio under the command of Colonel Timothy Robbins Stanley, former commander of the 18th Ohio. Stanley‚Äôs brigade was part of Negley‚Äôs division of the 14th Army Corps, which came to be known as the Army of the Cumberland. The Michiganders came under fire again on October 5, 1862, when they repelled a guerrilla ambush near Fort Riley while out on a foraging expedition.Faust, 11th Michigan, 60-63. After Bragg‚Äôs invasion was repulsed at Perryville, the 11th Michigan joined the Army of the Cumberland‚Äôs advance under Major General William Starke Rosecrans in late December, and was heavily engaged at the Battle of Stones River. The green Michiganders fought bravely despite absorbing severe casualties (140 killed, wounded, or missing‚Äîa 32 percent loss), and helped stall Bragg‚Äôs powerful opening assault shy of Rosecrans‚Äôs supply artery, the Nashville Pike. The unit took part in the decisive charge across Stones River on January 2, 1863, participating in the rout of John C. Breckinridge's division.Faust, 11th Michigan, 66-76. After months of recuperation in Murfreesboro, Rosecrans advanced again in the Tullahoma Campaign on June 23, 1863, turning Bragg‚Äôs army out of its position, and repeated this feat to force his retreat from Chattanooga. When Rosecrans pushed too aggressively in pursuit, Negley‚Äôs division, the 11th Michigan included, was nearly cut off and captured, but fought a successful delaying action against a vastly superior Confederate force at the Battle of Davis‚Äôs Cross Roads. The 11th was the most heavily engaged unit in the battle, losing 3 dead, 11 wounded, and 3 missing (the missing soldiers later perished at Andersonville). A week later, the adversaries clashed again at the Battle of Chickamauga, where the 11th Michigan on September 20, 1863, helped parry a Rebel attempt to flank George H. Thomas‚Äôs corps and cut the Union army off from its line of retreat. The Michiganders participated in the ambush of Brigadier General Daniel Weisiger Adams‚Äôs brigade, inflicting severe losses on the Confederates and capturing Adams in the process. Later that day‚Äîwith Stanley wounded, Stoughton raised to brigade command, and Mudge leading the regiment‚Äîthe 11th Michigan participated in the legendary defense of Snodgrass Hill (also known as Horseshoe Ridge), inflicting catastrophic casualties on the Confederate brigade of Archibald Gracie. Confederate general Joseph Kershaw, witnessing the attack, declared it ‚Äúone of the heaviest assaults of the war on a single point.‚Äù Michigan sergeant William G. Whitney earned the Medal of Honor for gathering desperately needed ammunition from downed Rebels between the lines‚Äîwhile under fire from Rebel sharpshooters‚Äîduring a brief lull in the assault. Overall casualties for the 11th Michigan at Chickamauga amounted to 66 men, with Mudge among the wounded.Faust, 11th Michigan, 87-110, 228n26. The Union defeat at Chickamauga left the Army of the Cumberland virtually under siege in Chattanooga, but the arrival of reinforcements under Ulysses S. Grant turned the tables several weeks later, and the 11th Michigan joined in the Battle of Missionary Ridge on November 25, 1863. Stoughton was again in command of the brigade, and Major Benjamin G. Bennett led the regiment with Mudge still recovering from his Chickamauga wound. The Michiganders, despite having Bennett and Color Bearer John Day killed, successfully charged uphill against the entrenched Rebels of Otho F. Strahl‚Äôs brigade, with lead elements of the Michigan regiment penetrating a gap between Strahl‚Äôs troops and the neighboring brigade of Randall Gibson. Quartermaster Sergeant James Wood King, who entered the battle outside his line of duty, was among the first soldiers to reach the summit and fight to pry open the breach in the Rebel line. King was later nominated for the Medal of Honor. Bragg‚Äôs siege was broken by the Federal assault, and the Confederates were hurtled into a precipitous retreat. Stoughton‚Äôs troops participated in the pursuit of Bragg‚Äôs army the next day, launching a night assault in pitch darkness near Graysville, Georgia, and capturing the Confederate artillery battery of Thomas B. Ferguson without the loss of a single soldier.Faust, 11th Michigan, 120-25; Faust, Conspicuous Gallantry, 116-20, 197. After wintering at Rossville and Graysville, Georgia, the 11th Michigan joined in William Tecumseh Sherman‚Äôs Atlanta Campaign. The Michiganders were present, but only lightly engaged, at Buzzard Roost Gap and the Battle of Resaca. At the Battle of Pickett‚Äôs Mill, the unit came under artillery fire, followed by its first taste of prolonged trench warfare. With the resumption of Sherman‚Äôs advance, the Michiganders again dug in, at Kennesaw Mountain, where they traded constant sniping with the Rebels but were mercifully excluded from the bloody Battle of Kennesaw Mountain on June 27. In pursuit of the subsequent Confederate retreat, the Michiganders were engaged at Battle of Ruff‚Äôs Station, where Colonel Stoughton suffered a severe shell wound that necessitated the amputation of his leg. Five companies from the 11th Michigan participated in a successful but costly assault against Rebel entrenchments near the railroad, losing three dead and ten wounded.Faust, 11th Michigan, 133-39. The 11th Michigan was again lightly engaged at Peachtree Creek on July 20, where the unit rushed the length of the Union line under artillery fire to plug a gap with John Newton‚Äôs 4th Corps division. In the ensuing actions against Atlanta, the regiment was again called upon to charge entrenched Rebels, this time at the Battle of Utoy Creek on August 7. The Michiganders seized the first line of Confederate trenches at the cost of fifteen dead and fifteen wounded. With the regiment‚Äôs three-year enlistment period about to expire, the soldiers nearly mutinied when ordered to charge across the open field, but a timely speech by Mudge convinced the bluecoats to do their duty under fire one last time.Faust, 11th Michigan, 140, 142-46. The regiment was relieved from front line duty on August 27, but a Rebel cavalry raid by Joseph Wheeler necessitated their involvement in another infantry-cavalry chase. After helping to drive Wheeler off, the unit finally embarked for home via railroad on September 19. Stopping at Sidney, Ohio, on the 24th, the Michiganders stumbled across Copperhead Clement L. Vallandigham and democratic vice presidential candidate George H. Pendleton, both of whom were reviled by the soldiers for their antiwar stances. Mudge narrowly restrained his soldiers from killing the politicians, who were chased off but still delivered speeches in town later that day. Upon departing Sidney, Mudge‚Äôs troops made off with a cannon used by Vallandhigham‚Äôs supporters to fire off salutes in his honor. The 11th Michigan returned home safely, and was mustered out on October 11, 1864.Faust, 11th Michigan, 146-50. Total Strength and casualties The 11th Michigan had a total enrollment of about 1,323 men. (Precise figures are unavailable due to lax recordkeeping, and the numbers vary by source.) Approximately 279 of the Michiganders died in the service (97 in battle). About 265 were discharged for disability.Faust, 11th Michigan, 150, 161. Commanders *William J.

As well as traditional theatre, SUDS has been involved in the production and staging of student written productions, experimental plays, improvised theatre, and various comedy revues. SUDS currently operates out of the society's own production space, the Cellar Theatre, underneath the Holme Building on the Camperdown Campus of the University of Sydney. Before this plays were regularly housed in St James' Hall and the Society's own performance space on George Street, with smaller productions housed in the University's Footbridge and Wallace Theatres. During the society's heyday SUDS was considered one of the leading production companies in Australia, attracting a range of theatrical talent and audiences beyond its student base. This popularity peaked in the postwar years of the 1950s-60s during which time many prominent actors and personalities passed through its ranks. SUDS is considered to have played a leading role in the establishment of Australian theatre, alongside breakaway group The Sydney Players, during this time. Alumni SUDS has nurtured a number of notable alumni who have gone on to excel in the arts, most notably John Bell AO, OBE, who went on to found the Bell Shakespeare Company following his time at the University of Sydney.

A full year of tension, including minor skirmishes, passed before these events would escalate into the Croatian War of Independence. Background In the lead up to the first free elections in April and May 1990, the ethnic relations between the Croats and the Serbs in SR Croatia became a subject of political debate. The local Serbs in the village of Berak put up barricades in order to disrupt the elections. During the act of government transition from the former to the new authorities in Croatia, the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) organized a \\"regular military maneuvre\\" in which a regiment of parachutists was deployed to the Pleso Airport, which was taken as an implicit threat. On May 14, 1990, the weapons of the Territorial Defense (TO) of Croatia were taken away by the Army, preventing the possibility of Croatia having its own weapons like it was done in Slovenia. According to Borisav Joviƒá, this action was done at the behest of the Republic of Serbia. This action left Croatia extremely vulnerable to pressure from Belgrade, whose leadership began to intensify their public challenges to Croatia's borders. In an act of protest, the militant part of Croatian Serbs in some areas where they formed a majority started to refuse authority to the new Croatian government and beginning in early 1990 held several meetings and public rallies in support of their cause and in protest against the new government. These protests were in support of Serbian nationalism, a centralized Yugoslavia and Milo≈°eviƒá (see Anti-bureaucratic revolution). In June and July 1990, Serb representatives in Croatia openly rejected the new government's proposed amendments to the Constitution of SR Croatia which changed the name of the republic and entered new state symbols. The new Coat of arms of Croatia was known colloquially as \\"the chessboard\\" by the Serb population, who associated it with the symbols of the Nazi-allied Independent State of Croatia (known by its Serbo-Croatian initials NDH) during World War II, although the chessboard is a historical Croatian symbol since 15th century and had already officially been contained in the emblem of the SR Croatia within Yugoslavia.Elena Guskova.

In the summer of 1990 the process of dissolution was ongoing, with the Croatian government implementing policies that were seen as openly nationalistic and anti-Serbian in nature, such as the removal of the Cyrillic script from correspondence in public offices (the Serbian register of Serbo-Croatian is usually written in an adapted Cyrillic script while the Croatian and Bosnian registers use the Latin).Elena Guskova.

The policy was especially noticeable in the Ministry of Internal Affairs, as some of the Serbs serving there were arrested for supporting Krajina Militia also known as Martiƒá's Police.

The blockade was mostly made from logs cut down from nearby woods, which is why the event was dubbed the \\"Log Revolution\\". The organizers were armed with illegal weapons supplied by Martiƒá. Since it was a planned action, timed during the summer holiday season and severing land ties to the popular tourist region of Dalmatia, high economic damage was done to Croatian tourism. The revolt was explained by the Serbs with words that they are \\"terrorized [by Croatian government]\\" and that they \\"[fight for] more cultural, language and education rights\\". Serbian newspaper \\"Veƒçernje Novosti\\" wrote that \\"2.000.000 Serbs [are] ready to go to Croatia to fight\\". The Western diplomats commented that the Serbian media is inflaming passions and Croatian government said \\"We knew about the scenario to create confusion in Croatia...\\".Roads Sealed as Yugoslav Unrest Mounts, New York Times, August 1990 The minor skirmishes of the Log Revolution had apparently caused a police casualty - in the night of November 22/23, 1990, a Croatian police car was fired upon on a hill near Obrovac and one of the policemen, 27-year-old Goran Alavanja, died of seven gunshot wounds. The incident involved three policemen of Serb ethnicity who were reportedly shot by a sole rebel Serb gunman, but the murder was never actually officially resolved. In another earlier incident near Petrinja, another Croatian policeman one Josip Bo≈æiƒáeviƒá, was shot by a firearm in the night of September 28, 1990, and a leaked Ministry of Internal Affairs memo classified this as a fatality. On December 21, 1990, the municipalities of Knin, Benkovac, Vojniƒá, Obrovac, Graƒçac, Dvor and Kostajnica adopted the \\"Statute of the Serbian Autonomous Region of Krajina\\". Over two hundred armed incidents involving the rebel Serbs and Croatian police were reported between August 1990 and April 1991.David C.

The film was to be directed by Luigi Zampa. The director wanted to allocate the proportion of the guard at Peppino De Filippo and that of his wife Anna Magnani, but had to cancel the movie because some of his old movies had problems with censorship. So the direction was entrusted to Monicelli and Steno. The film was one of the first to be produced by the production house \\"Ponti-De Laurentiis\\" and was Carlo Ponti had the idea to put together Tot√≤ and Aldo Fabrizi. In real life, the two actors were affectionate friends, but had never worked together. Everyone was worried about what might happen Tot√≤ and putting together Fabrizi, however, everything went very well. Tot√≤ was a bit 'hesitant at first, when he was offered the role, because it was very different from the characters he had played before. The shooting of Steno and Monicelli began February 3, 1951, but because of the problems they had with the censorship the film was released towards the end of the year, so Steno and Monicelli had to change some things in the film already shot. *In more than a chase scene you can see that the 4 actors (Tot√≤, Fabrizi, Castellani and Tubbs), obviously framed from behind, have been replaced by doubles and an example is the scene of the crossing in the mud. *Aldo Fabrizi and Tot√≤ were not able to finish the scene where they are sitting at the inn. The cause was the laughter that the two actors could not hold back during the course of the sequence. In more than one occasion Fabrizi watered the face of Tot√≤ with coffee that had just taken, because suddenly burst out laughing.

The -long line forms two Deutsche Bahn routes. Route 465 extends from Cologne to Koblenz, via Troisdorf, Bonn-Beuel, Unkel, and Neuwied. From Koblenz, Route 466 extends to Wiesbaden, via R√ºdesheim am Rhein. Together with the Taunus railway (Route 645.1), the line is used by Stadt-Express line SE-10 of the Rhine-Main Transport Association, which runs from Frankfurt to Koblenz and Neuwied. With the Cologne-Frankfurt high-speed railway and the Sieg Railway, the East Rhine Railway forms a six-track line between Cologne-Porz and Troisdorf. It includes two tunnels between R√ºdesheim and Niederlahnstein, including the well-known Loreley Tunnel near Sankt Goarshausen. History  Soon after the opening of the first railways in the region, a line on the right bank of the Rhine began to be discussed. In 1844 the Mayor of Deutz suggested building a line from Deutz via R√ºdesheim to Wiesbaden. In 1852, the town of Neuwied also began to press strongly for the building of a railway. However, others, particularly Prussia, had substantial reservations. There were military objections to a railway line along the Rhine (the extension of the West Rhine railway past Rolandseck was similarly delayed). In particular, the Prussian military objected that the suggested route would pass close to the Ehrenbreitstein Fortress, part of the Koblenz Fortress system. Therefore, in 1853 the Prussian War Ministry declared itself against the line. =Building of the southern section= For the Duchy of Nassau such considerations had less weight than the economic advantages. Therefore, it gave the Wiesbaden Railway Company (Wiesbadener Eisenbahngesellschaft) a concession to build the East Rhine line on Nassau national territory. On 11 August 1856, the first section of the Nassau Rhine Railway (Nassauische Rheinbahn) was opened from Wiesbaden to R√ºdesheim. Because of the difficult nature of the construction, the Nassau government took over construction in 1858, establishing the Nassau State Railway in 1861. As a result, the line was not extended to Oberlahnstein until 22 February 1862 and Niederlahnstein until 3 June 1864. From 1862 to 1900 the Bingerbr√ºck‚ÄìR√ºdesheim train ferry operated between Bingerbr√ºck and R√ºdesheim, connecting the East Rhine lines and the Nahe Valley Railway. The construction of the Sieg Railway from Deutz to Giessen (which started in 1859) enabled Nassau to negotiate with Prussia over the continuation of the line, since the planned Sieg line passed through the Dillenburg district, which was part of Nassau. Finally in 1860 an agreement between both states was concluded, which allowed Prussia to build the Sieg line. In return Prussia agreed to build the Pfaffendorf Bridge, which connected the line near Niederlahnstein with the West Rhine Railway (Linke Rheinstrecke) in Koblenz finished the year before. The bridge was inaugurated on 3 June 1864. A continuation of the East Rhine line through Prussia was not possible for the time being, because the concession that the Rhenish Railway had received for the West Rhine line had specified that no concession would be given for a railway on the right bank of the Rhine before 1876. = Building of the northern section = As a result of the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, Nassau became part of Prussia, changing the situation in the Rhine completely. The Rhenish Railway Company (Rheinische Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft) now had an interest in completing the East Rhine line, and soon received a concession for it. On 27 October 1869, the extension of the line was opened from Niederlahnstein to Neuwied. Planning options considered for the East Rhine line between Beuel and Siegburg. The curved route via Friedrich-Wilhelms-H√ºtte was built. The route of the northern end was contentious. The concession referred to a line between Siegburg and Niederlahnstein and under the original plans the line should have turned at Beuel on the Rhine to Siegburg. Later the line should have been extended via the Agger River valley to Overath and then via Witten to Bochum, or alternatively Essen. These plans were, however, viewed critically in Cologne, since it would have involved the construction of a major traffic axis through the Bergisches Land near Cologne. Gustav von Mevissen, president of the Rhenish Railway, preferred a route via Troisdorf and Opladen to Essen. Emil Langen, board member of the Rhenish Railway and director of Friedrich-Wilhelms Ironworks in Troisdorf (now the location of the suburb and station of Troisdorf-Friedrich-Wilhelms-H√ºtte), finally implemented a change in the planned route north of Beuel. The new route went northeast from Beuel, crossing the Sieg river at Menden (now part of Sankt Augustin). A station would be built at the Friedrich-Wilhelms works and the line would then turn southeast to parallel the Sieg Railway to Siegburg. On July 11, 1870 the section of line was opened from Neuwied to Oberkassel, where the Bonn‚ÄìOberkassel train ferry provided a connection between the West Rhine and East Rhine lines. In addition, the line from Friedrich-Wilhelms-H√ºtte to Siegburg had already been completed; the complete opening of the line only awaited the completion of the Sieg bridge. During the Franco-Prussian War, the line was of great strategic importance as a supply route. As a result, the building of the Sieg bridge was accelerated with extra workers, starting in the late summer of 1870. The whole route was opened on March 1, 1871. At the same time a branch was opened from Friedrich-Wilhelms-H√ºtte to Troisdorf and the line to Cologne, which would later become the main line. =Later changes= Map of railway lines in the Koblenz area In 1878/79, the Horchheim rail bridge was built south of Koblenz, creating a further connection between the West Rhine and East Rhine lines. During World War I, three Rhine crossings were built using very similar building methods: * From 1913 to 1915, the Hindenburg Bridge was built between R√ºdesheim am Rhein and Bingen-Kempten, connecting to the West Rhine line and the Nahe Valley Railway (Nahetalbahn). * From 1916 to 1918, the Neuwied‚ÄìKoblenz line, including the Kronprinz-Wilhelm Bridge was built between Urmitz and Neuwied- Engers. * From 1916 to 1919, the Ludendorff Bridge was built between Erpel and Remagen, connecting the East Rhine railway with the West Rhine line and the strategically important Ahr Valley Railway (Ahrtalbahn). It became famous as the \\"Remagen Bridge\\" in the last days of World War II. All three bridges were destroyed in World War II. Only the Kronprinz-Wilhelm Bridge was rebuilt, as the Urmitz railway bridge, in 1954. In 1961, during the electrification of the line, new single-line tunnels were built parallel to the existing double-line Loreley and Rossstein tunnels. The old tunnels were then converted to single- line operations and electrified. With the opening of the Cologne-Frankfurt high-speed rail line at the end of 2002, Troisdorf station was completely rebuilt and the connections from the East Rhine railway towards Siegburg were removed. Operations Freight train north of Unkel Bonn-Beuel station The line is heavily congested and gives priority to long-distance freight trains. Long distance passenger trains in the Rhine Valley use the West Rhine line and the Cologne-Frankfurt high-speed line. When there are line closures on the left side, the long-distance trains are diverted to the East Rhine route. It that case the stop for Bonn is replaced with Bonn-Beuel. Passenger services on the line are provided by RegionalBahn and Regional-Express trains. According to Deutsche Bahn timetables, the East Rhine route is KBS 465 (Cologne-Koblenz) and KBS 466 (Koblenz-Wiesbaden). The KBS 465 added a section from Cologne to M√∂nchengladbach a few years ago. All passenger trains start or finish at the Koblenz main station. Trains from there in the direction of Wiesbaden cross on the Horchheimer Bridge (south of Koblenz). Trains travelling in the direction of Cologne cross the Urmitz Railway Bridge (north of Koblenz), or travel via Vallendar over the Horchheimer Bridge. Generally Regional-Express trains operate every two hours between the Frankfurt and Wiesbaden main train stations and Koblenz. RegionalBahn trains operate every two hours between the Wiesbaden main station and Koblenz. Regional-Express trains operate every hour between M√∂nchengladbach main station and Koblenz, via Cologne Central Station and Vallendar, using the Horchheim bridge. RegionalBahn trains operate every hour between M√∂nchengladbach Hbf, Cologne Hbf and Koblenz, via the Urmitz Railway Bridge. The northern section is also served hourly by the Rhein-Erft-Express (RE 8) and the Rhein-Erft-Bahn (RB 27) lines. The RE-8 serves the Cologne/Bonn Airport station and extends south of Koblenz on the Horchheimer Bridge. It uses Series-425 electric locomotives and a maximum speed of 140 km/h. The RB 27 operates between Porz and Koblenz, crossing from the north via the Urmitz Bridge. It operates non-stop from Koblenz to Cochem twice daily. The RB-27 uses Series-143 electric locomotives and three double-decker carriages with a maximum speed of 120 km/h. From Moenchengladbach to Rommerskirchen, the tariffs of the Verkehrsverbund Rhein- Ruhr (VRR) apply; from Grevenbroich to Neuwied, those of the Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Sieg (VRS); and from Unkel to Koblenz, the tariffs of the Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Mosel (VRM). Until 2010, the southern section was served by the Loreley-Bahn (RB 10) and the Loreley-Express (RE 10) services, using electric class 143 or 110 locomotives and 4-5 coaches every one or two hours. In 2007, the operation of services on the section from the Koblenz‚ÄìFrankfurt section was tendered by the Rhein-Main-Verkehrsverbund (Rhine-Main Transport Association, RMV) and the Zweckverband Schienenpersonennahverkehr Rheinland- Pfalz Nord (Association for Passenger Rail Transport of Rhineland-Palatinate North). On 12 December 2010, VIAS GmbH took over operations of the service, now called the RheingauLinie (originally numbered SE 10, but called RB 10 again from December 2016). Between Koblenz, Lahnstein and Wiesbaden trains now stop at every station, but between Wiesbaden and Frankfurt Central Station there now only two stops. Similarly, between Neuwied and Koblenz Central Station there were initially no stations. Since its completion in April 2011, Koblenz Stadtmitte station has also been served. The services run every hour, sometimes even every half-hour. VIAS GmbH uses new Stadler FLIRT sets for the service. Because of the renewal of track on the line in 2010 and the good acceleration of the FLIRT sets, the travel time is only slightly longer than that of the former RE 10 service, which did not stop at each station. Between Koblenz and Kaub, tariffs of the Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Mosel apply and between Lorchhausen and Wiesbaden/Frankfurt, the tariffs of the Rhein-Main- Verkehrsverbund (RMV). Current developments = Track reconstruction/electronic interlockings = Deutsche Bahn AG planned further closures on the line. Unkel, Rheinbrohl, R√ºdesheim, Hattenheim and Oestrich- Winkel stations would be largely abandoned in connection with the installation of electronic interlockings on the line. A simulation and an operational test in the course of the Netz 21 (network 21) strategy had shown at the end of 1998 that with new, fast rolling stock for regional services and alternating stops, the top speed on the Wiesbaden‚ÄìNeuwied section could be raised from 50 to 80 km/h and that several overtaking loops, 67 sets of points and 10 km of track could be dispensed with. The dismantling was carried out without Federal Railway Authority (Eisenbahn-Bundesamt, EBA) approval. The line is already at 93% capacity, with an extreme mix of different types of trains with considerably differing top speeds, including scheduled passenger services, which is already subject a high level of delays. The EBA has also asked DB Netz to provide more overtaking tracks in the stations of Niederdollendorf, Unkel, Rheinbrohl, Bad H√∂nningen, Hattenheim and Oestrich-Winkel, some of which were illegally withdrawn from railway operations. On 3 October 2014, the signal boxes in Schierstein, Niederwalluf, Eltville, Hattenheim and Geisenheim were taken out of service at 5:30 am CET and signalling has since been controlled by the operations centre in Frankfurt and, if necessary, via the under operations centre (Unterzentrale, UZ) in Oberlahnstein. The signal box in Oestrich-Winkel will remain for at least two more years (until ca. 2017), the signal box in R√ºdesheim is to be permanently preserved as a so-called Inselstellwerk (island signal box). = S-Bahn line between Troisdorf and Bonn‚ÄìOberkassel = In order to link Bonn to Cologne and the Cologne Bonn Airport, the S-Bahn line that connects Cologne with Troisdorf is being extended along the East Rhine Railway to Bonn-Oberkassel. The first plans for this line were made in the 1990s as part of the planning approval procedure for the Cologne-Frankfurt high-speed railway. In addition to the existing stations on the Right Rhine line, new stations are planned in Bonn-Ramersdorf and Bonn-Vilich. The latter is to be established as a two-level station with a link with the Siebengebirgsbahn, a section of the Bonn Stadtbahn. The construction costs for the 13 km-long line is (as of December 2014) up to ‚Ç¨502 to be mainly borne by the federal Government. The state of NRW is contributing ‚Ç¨47.5 million to these costs. According to Deutsche Bahn‚Äôs plans, construction is to begin in early 2017. Since the trains of the East Rhine railway are planned to run on schedule during the construction period, a construction period of twelve years is estimated. The route is due to be finished at the end of 2028. On the section between Troisdorf and Bonn-Beuel, S-Bahn services are planned to commence at the end of 2026. = New stations = The construction of new stations is planned in Bendorf (at the Rheinstra√üe level crossing) and in Koblenz-Horchheim (at the Alte Heerstra√üe overbridge). The construction costs are estimated at ‚Ç¨1.5 million in Bendorf and ‚Ç¨1 million in Horchheim.

Chris is Marlo Stanfield's second-in- command and bodyguard in his drug dealing operation. Despite Chris' quiet demeanor, he commits more murders, both on-screen and off-screen, than any other character. He is a ruthless killer but shows genuine care towards the soldiers under his command, especially Michael Lee, whom he takes under his wing as a prot√©g√©. Character storyline =Season 3= Chris is a key player in the Stanfield Organization's turf war with the Barksdale Organization and is always looking out for Marlo's safety. He often meets with Marlo and Marlo's adviser Vinson to discuss their strategy. Chris's cautious observation identifies Avon Barksdale's car when Avon tries to set a trap for Marlo. Chris has his driver pull up alongside the Barksdale car, then fires a shotgun into the side window, wounding Avon and killing a Barksdale soldier named Tater. When Marlo kills Devonne, the woman responsible for setting up the attempted ambush, Chris accompanies him and calmly tells Marlo that it needs to be done. When Stringer Bell is murdered (by Omar Little and Brother Mouzone), Chris and Felicia \\"Snoop\\" Pearson are assumed to be responsible, and they do nothing to dispel these rumors. The turf war comes to an end when Stringer's death and Avon's arrest lead to the demise of the Barksdale Organization, and Stanfield assumes control of most of the drug trade in Western Baltimore. =Season 4= Chris carries out murders as Stanfield orders them. Working alongside Partlow's protege, the young female soldier \\"Snoop\\", Chris disposes of bodies by opening up vacant buildings, covering the corpses in quicklime and plastic sheeting, and then using a nail gun to nail the buildings shut. When Stanfield dealer Fruit is killed, Chris advises restraint, suggesting they kill the perpetrator instead of all the members of the independent drug crew he works with. Marlo agrees with Chris' approach and gives him the go-ahead to kill Fruit's murderer, Lex. Chris arranges for Lex to be ambushed by paying Little Kevin to tell Lex his girlfriend wants to meet him at night in a secluded spot. Kevin pays an unwitting Randy Wagstaff to pass on the message. Once the trap is sprung, Lex is killed by Chris and Snoop. Chris is also responsible for the murder of a security guard who \\"talked back\\" to Marlo. Rumors on the street tie Chris to several other murders, including victims known as Pookie and Byron. Chris continues to be Marlo's key adviser. He tries to dissuade Marlo from playing at a high-stakes card game where he is losing a considerable amount of money. When the game is robbed by Omar Little, Marlo asks Chris for his advice on how best to deal with Omar. Chris suggests a more subtle approach than simply placing a bounty on Omar. They plan to stage a robbery of their associate Old Face Andre and blame the robbery on Omar, having Andre identify him. Chris carries out the robbery himself, and kills a delivery woman in Andre's store and beats Andre to lend credence to their scenario. Marlo entrusts Chris with cultivating new prospect Michael Lee. Michael is a middle school child who Marlo believes would make a good soldier. Chris is responsible for intimidating Lex's crew chief Bodie Broadus into giving up his corner, since Marlo has seen that Bodie has turned it into a profitable location. Chris forces Bodie to accept Marlo's package, which is inferior to the high quality heroin Bodie had been purchasing from Proposition Joe Stewart. Chris asks Bodie about Michael, having noticed that Michael had worked with Bodie for a time. Chris tracks Michael to his home and then approaches him when he is talking with Dukie, Namond Brice, and Randy. Chris offers Michael cash and promises of protection if he joins Marlo's organization, an offer that Michael eventually accepts after the unwelcome return of his stepfather, Devar, who (it is implied) had molested Michael and might be grooming Bug to be molested. At Michael's request, Chris and Snoop take care of the situation with Michael's stepfather. When he confronts Devar, Chris questions him about molesting little boys and asks him about any past homosexual activity in prison. After Devar dismissively admits to having had homosexual sex while locked up, Chris proceeds to viciously beat him to death, in stark contrast to the business- like way his other hits are carried out, contributing to the suggestion that Chris, too, may have been a victim of molestation as a child, or while incarcerated. Michael joins the Stanfield Organization under the condition they also look out for his younger brother, Bug. Chris takes Michael on as a prot√©g√© to the point where Marlo refers to Michael as Chris' \\"pup\\". Chris appears to relate to Michael and his implied history of abuse, and takes Michael under his wing. Chris and Snoop are twice pulled over by detectives during the season. The first time, it is by Herc, who had been following them, but Chris is able to hide their firearms in a hidden compartment. Herc discovers their nail gun and lime in the back of the vehicle, but takes little notice. Once they are released, Chris disposes of the nail gun. The second time, they are confronted by Kima Greggs and Lester Freamon. Snoop again hides their firearms, but Kima discovers the hidden gun compartment and weapons. Chris and Snoop are arrested but later released, as the police can tie neither the weapons nor the vehicle to either of them. Eventually, the police are able to demonstrate not only that Chris (and thus Marlo) is responsible for the chain of disappearances in West Baltimore, but also that they have been disposing of the bodies in row houses all over town. =Season 5= Chris faces weapon charges from his arrest at the car stop but manages to get the hearings delayed. In the meantime, the police are unable to gather enough evidence to file charges on the vacant house murders related to Chris and Snoop, and begin a prolonged surveillance operation into the Stanfield Organization. Marlo and Chris respond to the efforts of the police investigation by stopping all phone communication to avoid further incriminating themselves, and instead meet face to face; they also scale back on committing violent crimes. Chris continues to mentor Michael Lee, who at this point was given his own corner after a meeting with Chris, Snoop, and Marlo following Chris' assassination of Devan. Upon concluding those issues, Marlo begins to scheme against the co-op, plotting against \\"Proposition Joe\\" Stewart by gathering information on his suppliers, so that he can establish his own connection to them and cut out the rest of the Baltimore crews and dealers who are dependent on the high quality supply of drugs sold by The Greek. Marlo's efforts allow him to gain new information regarding the dealers, and he instructs Chris to arrange a meeting with imprisoned Ukrainian enforcer Sergei Malatov to broker a meeting with The Greeks, after finding out Sergei is connected to The Greeks. Chris finds more information on Malatov at the courthouse, resulting in an initial meet with Avon Barksdale, who is incarcerated in the same prison as Sergei and formerly part of the drug ring connected to Sergei, and serves as the gatekeeper to Sergei. While Marlo conspires to wholesale drugs, the Major Case Unit is shut down as part of Mayor Carcetti's cutbacks on public spending, including policing. Consequently, narcotics, violent crimes, and homicides cannot be monitored as closely by the Baltimore police. Stanfield's organization notices this and resumes its criminal activities with full effect: Chris and Snoop gun down Junebug (a rival who may have been spreading rumors about Stanfield), attack Webster Franklin's territory (as he had refused the Stanfield package), and to lure Omar Little out of retirement in Puerto Rico. Chris leaves the Webster Franklin assignment to Snoop, but takes Snoop and Michael with him to kill Junebug. Chris waits for Junebug outside the victim's home and tutors Michael in the importance of the element of surprise. They disable the surveillance cameras, and Chris orders Michael to kill anyone who escapes out the back of the house. Chris and Snoop then stage a home invasion, killing Junebug, his bodyguard, and his domestic partner. The two children present escape with their lives: one hides in a closet, while the other flees out the back door. Michael lets the child go. The triple homicide is investigated by Detective Kima Greggs. Omar returns to Baltimore from Puerto Rico, after being told of Butchie's murder. Stanfield offered a bounty to anyone willing to provide a way to get to Omar, and Prop Joe's nephew Cheese gives up Butchie behind Joe's back, telling Chris the exact details of Omar's link to Butchie. Upon getting Snoop to scout Butchie's bar, Chris and Snoop kill one of his bodyguards and wound the other. They then brutally torture Butchie with multiple gunshot wounds and other assaults, whilst forcefeeding him alcohol to subdue the pain. As they do not learn from him anything about Omar's relationship to the bar owner, who serves as Omar's trusted advisor, bank, and close friend, or about Omar's location, Chris kills Butchie with a fatal headshot. He then instruct Butchie's surviving bodyguard to ensure that word of what happened reaches Omar. Snoop expresses worry, as they learned nothing about Omar's whereabouts, but Omar will now be targeting them. Chris reminds her they're working for Marlo, and Marlo wants Omar, so they'll keep Marlo inside and themselves move around until they kill him. Stanfield is successful in connecting with The Greeks, and Joe accompanies him to a meeting with Spiros Vondas. At a later meeting, without Joe, Stanfield persuades The Greeks to think of him as an insurance policy if ever Joe's unable to do business with them in the future. Stanfield then convinces Cheese to betray Joe by having Chris kidnap Cheese's rival--an East side Co-Op dealer named Hungry Man. Chris delivers Hungry Man to Cheese, and Cheese gives up Joe in exchange. Stanfield and Chris trap Joe in his home, and Chris murders Joe while Stanfield watches. As Marlo meets with Spiros Vondas in a city park, Chris and a Greek enforcer watch over the area. Vondas explains how Marlo is to communicate with him using picture messages on a Blackberry phone. After the meeting, Marlo tells Chris how good it feels to be wearing the crown and suggests a celebratory trip to Atlantic City. A cautious Chris reminds Marlo that Omar is going to make a move on them, suggesting that it is not the best time for a vacation. Chris then tells his family that he will be going away on business for a few weeks. From the sidewalk across the street, Marlo watches Chris' interactions with his children and their mother. Later that evening, Omar observes Monk's condominium. Chris later informs Marlo of Omar's reconnaissance. When Omar later attacks Monk's apartment, he walks into a trap: Chris, Michael, Snoop, and O-Dog are lying in wait. Donnie is shot dead, but Omar jumps from the balcony to escape, severely injuring his leg in the process. With Omar at large, Chris lies low for his own safety, worried about the safety of his girlfriend and children. After Kenard kills Omar, Chris is shown to be disappointed, but he readily returns to work. In the meantime, Bunk has used DNA evidence to connect Chris with the murder of Michael's stepfather Devan. Bunk delays arresting Chris as a favor to McNulty and Lester. When the police bust a narcotics resupply transaction from The Greeks, Chris is charged with murder, preventing his release on bail. Levy represents Chris and Stanfield, and suspects an illegal wiretap due to the speed with which charging documents were produced. In an effort to preserve as much of the case as possible, Rhonda Pearlman strikes a bargain with Levy: Levy will convince the Stanfield organization to plead to various charges in exchange for Pearlman's not revealing Levy's bribery of Grand Jury Prosecutor Gary DiPasquale at the city courthouse. Part of this deal involves Chris' pleading guilty to not only to murdering Michael's stepfather Devan, but as well to all of the bodies found in the vacants, charges which yield a sentence of life without parole. Chris willingly takes the life sentence for the Stanfield organization on the condition that his girlfriend and children are taken care of financially. Chris is briefly seen during the end-of-season montage conversing amicably with Wee-Bey Brice in the courtyard of the Maryland State prison; they are in a similar situation, both having been primary enforcers for West Baltimore kingpins and now are serving life sentences for committing murders (and taking sole responsibility for some murders they did not commit), at the behest of their respective bosses, all in service of protecting their families and their organizations.

Origins He was born on 29 September 1557 in Devon, the eldest son of John Bourchier, Lord FitzWarin (died 1557) (who died shortly after his birth, having predeceased his own father John Bourchier, 2nd Earl of Bath (died 1561)) by his wife Frances Kitson (died 1586),Per monument, Tawstock a daughter of Sir Thomas KitsonVivian, p.107 (died 1540) of Hengrave Hall, Suffolk and Margaret Donnington, Countess of Bath.

Marriages and children Mary Cornwallis (d.1627), first wife, portrait by George Gower, Manchester City Art Gallery He married twice: *Firstly, in secret on 15 December 1578, to Mary Cornwallis, a daughter of Sir Thomas Cornwallis (1518‚Äì1604), of Brome Hall, Eye, Suffolk. The marriage was largely arranged by Sir Thomas Kytson, the young earl's uncle and Mary's brother-in- law. The marriage was subsequently repudiated, according to some sources because the earl's mother, Frances Kytson, by then remarried to William Barnaby, would not consent to the match. A law suit was commenced in May 1590 and the marriage was annulled by a judge on 28 April 1581.http://www.tudorplace.com.ar/Bios/ThomasCornwallis.htm *Secondly, in 1583 to Lady Elizabeth Russell, daughter of Francis Russell, 2nd Earl of Bedford, Lord Lieutenant of Devon, the wealthiest and most powerful man in Devon. One of his many manors was Bishops Tawton, the village and parish church of which is situated directly across the River Taw and is prominently visible from Tawstock Court. They had four children, as shown in effigies on the monument at Tawstock, including the following: **Richard Bourchier, Lord FitzWarin, eldest son and heir apparent, died without issue, apparently within his father's lifetime.Described in the Heraldic Visitation of Devon, 1602, (Vivian, p.107) as \\"Ricus Bourchier, D'ns Fitzwarren d.s.p.\\" Dominus Fitzwarren (Lord Fitzwarren), was the courtesy title used by the eldest son and heir apparent of the Bourchier Earls of Bath **Edward Bourchier, 4th Earl of Bath (1590‚Äì1636), eldest surviving son and heir. **Lady Frances Bourchier (1587‚Äì1612), died unmarried aged 25.

A monument to her survives in the Bedford Chapel, Chenies, Buckinghamshire. It consists of a plain slab of black marble supported by four white marble Doric columns which forms a canopy to a second slab of black marble, under which is a step of black marble on the floor. Two heraldic lozenges on the lower slab are surmounted by an Earl's coronet, sculpted in relief in white marble. An inscription records the erection of the monument by Lady Anne Clifford (1590‚Äì1676) \\"her deare cosen\\", daughter of Lady Margaret Russell and therefore her first cousin, and she is mentioned several times in Anne's diaries.Katherine O. Acheson, The Memoir of 1603 and the Diary of 1616‚Äì1619 (Toronto, 2007). The arms displayed are of Bourchier with ten quarterings and are the same as shown on the gatehouse of Tawstock Court. Death and burial He and his wife, Elizabeth, are buried in the choir of St. Peter's Church, Tawstock, Devon, where one can see their elaborate monument.

It was restored in 1999 by Lawrence and Sue Kelland, mainly to replace the iron bands within the alabaster which threatened to rust and thereby expand to crack the stone. The iron was replaced with stainless steel and the monument was repainted.Notice board in church with photographic narrative of restoration Kneeling to the left is their adult son and an infant child, whilst on the right kneels their adult daughter with a recubant infant at her side. Two vines grow up on either side of the main effigies, on the dexter inhabited with heraldic escutcheons showing five generations of ancestry described by five shields of Bourchier impaling the arms of their wives. On the sinister vine are shown five similar escutcheons describing the ancestry of Elizabeth Russell over five generations as follows, from ground upwards:http://www.middlesex- heraldry.org.uk/publications/monographs/chenies/cheniesBKM-monuments.htm *Gules, three herrings hauriant argent (Herringham) *Sable, a griffin segreant between three cross crosslets fitchy argent (Froxmere) *Sable, three chevronnels ermine (Wyse ) *Sable, three dovecotes argent (Sapcote) *Argent, on a chief gules two mullets or (St John) At the top above the recumbent couple the two vines meet at which point is displayed an escutcheon of Bourchier impaling Russell. On the top of the cornice to the dexter is shown a large escutcheon of the Bourchier arms, on the sinister the arms of Russell. Above the couple is a black tablet inscribed in capital gold lettering with an epitaph. On the base is a further tablet containing a mix of anagram, chronogram and epigram, to be deciphered by the viewer. At the feet of the Earl is his crest of the head in-profile and shoulders of a bearded oriental man wearing a Phrygian cap with pointed tasselled top flopped over. At the feet of his wife is a goat statant argent armed and unguled or, the crest of Russell, now with horns broken off. =Crest= pointed cap gules;Vivian, p.106 Russell: A goat statant argent armed and unguled or Debrett's Peerage, 1968, p.131 The Bourchier crest was explained by John Weever (died 1632) as follows:John Weever, Antient Funeral Monuments, of Great-Britain, Ireland, and the Islands Adjacent, 1767 edition, p.391 > \\"In the hall of the manor house of Newton Hall in this parish (i.e. Little > Dunmow, Essex) remaineth in an old painting two postures, the one for an > ancestor of the Bourchiers, combatant with another, being a pagan king, for > the truth of Christ, whom the said Englishman overcame and in memory thereof > his descendants have ever since bore the head of the same infidel as also > used the surname BOWSER, as I had it out of the collections of Augustin > Vincent, Windsor Herald, deceased\\"'' The Phrygian cap is an iconographical symbol of Oriental kings. =Epitaph= Above the couples' effigies is a black rectangular tablet inscribed in capital gold lettering with an epitaph in Latin as follows: > Ae(ternae) S(acrum).

This do and thou shalt live\\" =Cryptic tablet= Cryptic tablet on base of monument to William Bourchier, 3rd Earl of Bath (died 1623) On the base of his monument appears a cryptic tablet. It comprises separate elements of anagram, chronogram and epigram. Top: Bathon(i)ae Com(i)ti Devonae praefecto memoriae ergo (\\"To the memory of the Earl of Bath therefore to the prefect (i.e. Lord Lieutenant) of Devon\\"). Beneath this line is in the centre an inscribed skull and cross-bones, with to its left the image of a phoenix rising from a fire above which is Morior Orior (\\"I am dead, I shall arise\\") above which is inscribed on a scroll the well- known Roman epithet: Mors mihi lucrum (\\"Death to me is reward\\"). On the right side of the skull is an image of a circular dial inscribed around the circumference with the first two letters of the 12 months of the year. The top-most month, which is crowned, is IV i.e. JU for July, the month of his death. Above is inscribed: Finis Coronat (\\"the end crowns\\"), above which is inscribed on a scroll the French motto of Bourchier: Bon temps viendra (\\"The right time will come\\"). Within the skull is written on the top line grama, to which word three other words point from above the skull, ana-, chrono- and epi- (all Greek words in Latin form). These denote to the reader the presence of anagrams, chronograms, epigrams and other puzzles within the tablet. In the skull below the word grama are the two Latin words se and pul, and on the two bones which intersect behind the skull are written 4 more Latin words: ad, in, tum, and crum, which may all be combined together to form the sentences: in sepulcrum ad sepultum (\\"into the grave in order to be buried\\") or in sepultum ad se pulcrum (\\"in the act of burial one's-self (is made) beautiful\\"). Below is the anagram, on the top line the words Gulielmus Bourchier (\\"William Bourchier\\"), below which is the indicator ana-: and the name's Latin anagram Luge (si ob lucrum heri) (\\"mourn if on account of the profit of yesterday\\"). Below is a Latin epigram with some words in capitals, which may relate to a chronogram or other word-game: Quid sibi vult tumulus quidve haec insignia luctus est comes in superos ecce locumo tenens quare fles Devonia vel Bathonia quare (\\"If you wish to know what is this pile or why this great mourning, the Earl behold is above as place-holder (lieutenant), as weeps Devon and Bath\\"). Below is a chronogram: \\"eXIIt en bon teMps nVnCo VIenDra patet\\" (exiit en bon temps nunc (o?) viendra patet) a mixture of limited sense in Latin and the French motto of Bourchier, meaning \\"he went in good time now he shall come he seeks\\". When the capital Roman numerals are added together individually they make 1,623, the year of his death. Underneath is a further possibly cryptic epigram, with some words in capitals: Julius hoc mensis fuit Augustissimus anno atq(ue) secunda decem junge secunda dies non amor invidia est dolor euge lege alme viator et disce exemplo vivere: disce more sic cecivit (cecidit?) not elevit, translated as \\"The month of July was the most august in this year and the following day...is hatred not love, well-done! read O Traveller and teach by (his) example (how ) to live: teach (how) to die, thus he has fallen he has not arisen\\". At the end are two monograms: \\"R...E\\" and \\"AR\\". Other monuments A 1599 escutcheon in Weare Giffard Hall (about 8 miles south-west of Tawstock), then a seat of the Fortescue family, displays the arms of William Bourchier, 3rd Earl of Bath, with another two showing the Royal arms and those of Edward Russell, 3rd Earl of Bedford, Custos Rotulorum of Devon.

Biography Peyron was born in Aix-en-Provence, where he studied art under Claude Arnulphy.Philippe de Chennevi√®res, Recherches sur la vie et les ouvrages de quelques peintres, vol. 1, p. 44 He was later a pupil of Lagren√©e and was regarded as among the best painters of his generation. He was one of the first to re-apply the Classic principles of composition, in the manner of Poussin, while the prevailing fashion was in favour of Rococo. He won the prestigious Prix de Rome in 1773, ahead of David who was also a candidate. He spent the years between 1775 and 1782 in Rome, with the Academy of France in Rome. On his return to Paris, Peyron found that the career of David had taken its rise and has completely eclipsed his own, relegating it to a minor role in the history of art - which became evident in the exhibitions at the Salon of Paris between 1785 and 1787. David did, however, pay homage to Peyron at the time of his funeral, stating: ‚ÄúHe had opened my eyes.‚Äù Peyron died in Paris, aged 69.

Thessalonica had already been under Ottoman control from 1387 to 1403 before returning to Byzantine rule in the aftermath of the Battle of Ankara. In 1422, after the Byzantines supported Mustafa √áelebi as a rival pretender against him, Murad attacked Thessalonica. Unable to provide manpower or resources for the city's defense, its ruler, Andronikos Palaiologos, handed it over to the Republic of Venice in September 1423. The Venetians attempted to persuade the Sultan to recognize their possession, but failed as Murad considered the city his by right and the Venetians to be interlopers. This impasse led to an Ottoman blockade of Thessalonica, which occasionally flared up with direct attacks on the city. At the same time, the conflict was mostly fought as a series of raids by both sides against the other's territories in the Balkans and the Aegean islands. The Venetians repeatedly tried to apply pressure by blocking the passage of the Dardanelles at Gallipoli, with little success. The blockade quickly reduced the inhabitants to near starvation, and led many to flee the city. The restrictions placed on them by the siege, the inability of Venice to properly supply and guard the city, the violations of their customary rights, and rampant profiteering by Venetian officials led to the formation of a pro-surrender party within the city, which gained strength among the inhabitants. The city's metropolitan bishop, Symeon, encouraged his flock to resist. However, by 1426, with Venice's inability to secure peace on its own terms evident, a majority of the local population had come to prefer a surrender to avoid the pillage that would accompany a forcible conquest. Venice's efforts to find allies against the Ottomans also failed: the other regional potentates either pursued their own course, were themselves antagonistic to the Venetians, or were defeated by the Ottomans. After years of inconclusive exchanges, the two sides prepared for a final confrontation in 1429. In March, Venice formally declared war on the Ottomans, but even then the conservative mercantile aristocracy running the Republic were uninterested in raising an army sufficient to protect Thessalonica, let alone to force the Sultan to seek terms. In early 1430, Murad was able to concentrate his forces against Thessalonica, taking it by storm on 29 March 1430. The privations of the siege and the subsequent sack reduced the city to a shadow of its former self, from perhaps as many as 40,000 inhabitants to , and necessitated large- scale resettlement in the following years. Venice concluded a peace treaty with the Sultan in July, recognizing the new status quo. Over the next few decades, the antagonism between Venice and the Ottomans morphed into a rivalry over control of Albania. Background Map of the southern Balkans and western Anatolia in 1410. Ottoman and other Turkish territories are marked in shades of brown, Byzantine territory in pink, and Venetian and Venetian- influenced areas in green In the 14th century, the nascent Ottoman Empire were a rising power in the Near East. After subduing much of Anatolia, with the capture of Gallipoli in 1354, Ottoman Turks also acquired a foothold in the Balkans. The Christian powers of the region, notably the declining Byzantine Empire, were weak and divided, allowing a rapid Turkish expansion across the region, conducted both by the Ottomans themselves and by semi-independent Turkish ghazi warrior-bands. In 1369 the Ottomans were able to capture Adrianople, the third-most important city of the Byzantine Empire after its capital Constantinople and Thessalonica. Thessalonica, ruled by the Byzantine prince and future emperor Manuel II Palaiologos (), itself surrendered in 1387 after a lengthy siege (1383‚Äì1387), along with the cities of Christopolis and Chrysopolis. Initially the surrendered cities were allowed complete autonomy in exchange for payment of the hara√ß poll-tax. Following the death of Emperor John V Palaiologos in 1391, however, Manuel II escaped Ottoman custody and went to Constantinople, where he was crowned emperor, succeeding his father. This angered Sultan Bayezid I, who laid waste to the remaining Byzantine territories, and then turned on Chrysopolis, which was captured by storm and largely destroyed. Thessalonica submitted again to Ottoman rule at this time, possibly after a brief period of resistance, but was treated more leniently: although the city was brought under full Ottoman control, the Christian population and the Church retained most of their possessions, and the city retained its institutions. Thessalonica remained in Ottoman hands until 1403, when Emperor Manuel II sided with Bayezid's eldest son S√ºleyman in the Ottoman succession struggle that broke out following the crushing defeat of the Ottomans and the capture of Bayezid at the Battle of Ankara against the Turco- Mongol conqueror Timur in 1402. In exchange for his support, by the Treaty of Gallipoli the Byzantine emperor secured, among other concessions, the return of Thessalonica, part of its hinterland, the Chalcidice peninsula, and the coastal region between the rivers Strymon and Pineios. Despite the restoration of Byzantine rule, relations between Thessalonica and Constantinople remained troubled, with Thessalonica's local aristocracy jealously guarding their extensive privileges, which according to modern scholars amounted to virtual autonomy. This was part of a wider phenomenon attested for several cities during the last century of Byzantine history, as central authority weakened and centrifugal tendencies manifested themselves. In Thessalonica's case, a tendency to pursue increased independence from the imperial capital had been evident at least since the Zealot movement of the mid-14th century, and had been reinforced by Manuel II's autonomous regime in 1382‚Äì1387. Thus, after they returned to Byzantine control, Thessalonica and the surrounding region were given as an autonomous appanage to Manuel II's nephew, John VII Palaiologos. After his death in 1408, he was succeeded by Manuel's third son, the Despot Andronikos Palaiologos, who was supervised by Demetrios Leontares until 1415. During this time, Thessalonica enjoyed a period of relative peace and prosperity, as the Turks were preoccupied with their own civil war, although it was attacked by the rival Ottoman pretenders in 1412 (by Musa √áelebi) and 1416 (during the uprising of Mustafa √áelebi against Mehmed I). Once the Ottoman civil war ended, the Turkish pressure on the city built up again. Just as during the 1383‚Äì1387 siege, this led to a sharp division of opinion within the city between factions supporting resistance, if necessary with Western European (\\"Latin\\") help, and those urging submission to the Ottomans.  First Ottoman attacks and handover of the city to Venice  Miniature () showing Emperor Manuel II Palaiologos (2nd from left) with his family: his oldest son and co-emperor John VIII is first from left, while the Despot Andronikos is fourth The eventual victor in the Ottoman civil war, Mehmed I (), maintained good relations with the Byzantines who had supported him. The accession of Murad II () changed the situation, as John VIII Palaiologos (), the heir-apparent and de facto regent for the ailing Manuel II, set up Mustafa √áelebi as a rival to Murad. After defeating his opponent, Murad, determined to extinguish the remnants of the Byzantine state, laid siege, unsuccessfully, to Constantinople from 10 June to 6 September 1422. In June 1422, Burak Bey, the son of Evrenos, assisted by various Ottoman marcher- lords of the Balkans, besieged Thessalonica as well, and ravaged its suburbs and the western portion of Chalcidice. According to the city's metropolitan bishop, Symeon (in office 1416/17‚Äì1429), both he and Despot Andronikos sent repeated pleas for aid to Constantinople, but the imperial government was short of resources and preoccupied with its own problems. Eventually, a single unnamed commander was sent to the city, but he brought neither men nor money with him. This commander proposed setting up a common fund of the citizens to support the defence, but this proposal met with vehement opposition, particularly from the wealthy aristocrats, who would naturally have borne the brunt of the cost. The common people likewise proved unwilling to contribute; when the news spread that the Ottomans had offered a peaceful settlement, provided that Despot Andronikos left the city, the commoners even rioted in favour of an accommodation with the Ottomans. At that point a group of aristocrats persuaded the Despot to seek the assistance of the Republic of Venice, an initiative probably taken without consulting Constantinople. In spring 1423, via the Venetian colony of Negroponte, he informed the Venetians of his intention to hand over the city to them. When he informed the Venetians, they were appalled. The only conditions Andronikos attached to his offer were that the property, customs and privileges of the city's inhabitants, their right to trade and come and go freely, and the position of the city's Orthodox Church be respected, and that Venice pledge to defend the city against the Ottomans. The 16th-century chronicler Pseudo-Sphrantzes claims that Andronikos sold the city for 50,000 ducats, and this statement was often accepted by scholars until the mid-20th century. This is not mentioned in any other source, nor is it found in the original documents pertaining to the affair, as shown by the scholars Konstantinos Mertzios and Paul Lemerle. On the other hand, the Venetian envoys appointed to oversee the handover were authorized to provide a sum of 20,000‚Äì40,000 aspers from the revenue of the city as a yearly subsidy to Andronikos, should he request it. The offer arrived in Venice at an opportune time. The election of Francesco Foscari on 15 April 1423 as Doge of Venice had placed a proponent of a more aggressive and unyielding stance against Ottoman expansionism at the head of the Republic. But the majority of the Great Council of Venice was still dominated by the more cautious tendencies of the merchant nobility that ruled the Republic and they feared the disruption to trade that open war with the Ottomans would bring. Since the Fourth Crusade, the Venetians had consciously adopted a policy of gradually acquiring outposts, fortresses and islands from the collapsing Byzantine Empire, providing bases that secured Venice's valuable trading links with the East. For some time Venice had viewed Thessalonica as a possible expansion target, especially as Constantinople seemed to be on the verge of falling to the Turks. Thus in 1419, Venice re- established a consulate in the city, headed by a local Greek, George Philomati, and after his death in 1422 by his brother Demetrios. At a session of the Great Council on 7 July, Andronikos' offer was accepted. The council sent notices to the Venetian colonies in the Aegean Sea‚ÄîNegroponte, Nauplia, Tinos and Mykonos, and the vassal Duke of Naxos‚Äîto prepare ships to take possession of the city, while the Republic's bailo at Constantinople was instructed to secure the assent of Emperor Manuel. A week later Santo Venier and Niccolo Giorgio were named provveditori (plenipotentiary envoys) and tasked with going to Greece and, if Despot Andronikos were still willing, taking over the city and arranging for its defence by hiring mercenaries. Giorgio was then to go before the Sultan, inform him of Venice's acquisition of the city and justify it as an expedient to prevent the city from being captured by other Christians, who might have been hostile to the Sultan. The envoys were also to arrange for peace both between the Sultan and the Republic, and between the Sultan and Emperor Manuel. Emperor Manuel evidently gave his assent to the proposal, for on 14 September 1423 six Venetian galleys, accompanied by one Byzantine galley, entered the harbour of Thessalonica. The Venetians were greeted by a jubilant population as saviours. For the Thessalonians, Venetian rule meant not only security from the Turks‚Äîsome 5,000 Ottoman troops were besieging the city‚Äîbut more immediately, a secure flow of supplies. Nevertheless, large segments of the population continued to support the seeking of a settlement with the Ottomans; the writings of Metropolitan Symeon record that a number of inhabitants fled at this time to the Ottomans. This sentiment even included some members of the nobility: the contemporary Byzantine historian Doukas records that soon after taking over the city, the Venetians imprisoned four leading aristocrats, led by a certain Platyskalites, for their association with the Ottomans. The four men were exiled, first to Crete, and then to Venice itself and Padua. Only after the fall of Thessalonica in 1430 were the two survivors released. The contemporary Venetian Morosini Codex records a story of a conspiracy‚Äîdismissed as \\"slanderous\\" by Donald Nicol‚Äîled by Despot Andronikos to hand over the city to the Turks. The plot was reportedly discovered in November 1423, and Andronikos and his supporters were exiled, with the Despot sent to Nauplia in the Morea. Diplomatic and military events during the siege =Initial Venetian and Ottoman diplomatic and military approaches= Ottoman sultan Murad II. Idealized 19th-century portrait by Konstantin Kapƒ±daƒülƒ± The Venetians hoped to secure Ottoman consent to the occupation of Thessalonica. However, when the provveditore Giorgio attempted to carry out his mission to the Sultan's court, probably in February 1424, he was unsuccessful to the point of being arrested and imprisoned by Murad. The Ottomans refused to accept the handover, considering the Venetian presence illegal on account of their previous right to the city through conquest. The Ottoman attitude was summed up by the reply allegedly given by Murad to Venetian ambassadors seeking peace, as recorded by Doukas: When news of Giorgio's arrest arrived in Venice, the Great Council decided to replace both him and Venier. The first two choices for replacement, Jacopo Trevisan and Fantino Michiel, refused, but in May 1424, Bernardo Loredan was named duke (governor) of the city, with Jacopo Dandolo as captain (military commander), for a two-year term. In the meantime, Venier was instructed to secure the release of Giorgio, and recognition from the Sultan of Venetian control over Thessalonica, the surrounding villages, and the fort of Kortiach (Mount Chortiatis). In exchange, he was to offer an annual tribute of 1,000 to 2,000 ducats, and to distribute annuities to the Sultan's chief courtiers. The same instructions were given to the new captain-general of the fleet, Pietro Loredan, who sailed for Thessalonica. If he found the city under siege, Loredan was to attack Gallipoli‚Äîwhere he had scored a major victory in 1416‚Äîhinder the passage of Ottoman troops over the Dardanelles, and if practicable, to try and stir up opposition to the Sultan among neighbouring rulers. To emphasize the fact that Venice did not desire war, Loredan was instructed to inform the local Turkish commanders that his actions were only as a consequence of the imprisonment of Giorgio and the siege of Thessalonica, which they had acquired legally. This set the pattern for the six-year conflict between the Ottomans and Venice over control of Thessalonica. While the Ottomans blockaded and attacked Thessalonica from land, trying to starve it into surrender, the Republic sent repeated embassies to secure recognition of her possession of Thessalonica in exchange for an annual tribute. To back up their diplomatic efforts, the Venetians tried to put pressure on the Sultan by stirring up trouble along the Ottomans' periphery, sponsoring efforts for an anti-Ottoman crusade, and sending their fleet to attack Gallipoli. The Ottomans likewise tried to distract Venice by launching raids of their own on Venetian possessions in the Aegean. The Venetians had a possible and willing ally in the person of Junayd, ruler of the Turkish Aydinid principality in central western Anatolia. Junayd was a capable and energetic ruler who tried to form a broad anti-Ottoman alliance with another Turkish principality, the Karamanids of central Anatolia, and to renew the Ottoman civil war by sending another Ottoman prince, Ismail, to Rumelia (the Ottoman-ruled part of the Balkans). In the course of this conflict, Murad allied himself with Venice's rival, the Republic of Genoa, to blockade the coasts of Junayd's domain and prevent Ismail from setting sail. Junayd was finally subdued in spring 1425, depriving Venice of his assistance. In February 1424, Murad concluded a peace with the Byzantines, who returned almost all the lands they had gained in 1403 and, reduced to Constantinople and its environs, became tributary vassals to the Ottomans once more. Efforts at a crusade, meanwhile, faltered on the persistent rivalry of Venice and the King of Hungary, Sigismund, the protagonist of the failed anti-Ottoman Crusade of Nicopolis in 1396, over possession of Dalmatia. Both Venice and Hungary attempted to exploit the momentary Ottoman weakness and the resulting turmoil in the Balkans to expand their territories‚ÄîVenice in Dalmatia and Albania, Sigismund in Bosnia, Serbia, and Wallachia. Venice seized Zara, Split, and other Dalmatian cities from Hungary between 1412 and 1420. This policy brought the Republic into conflict with the Despot of Serbia, Stefan Lazareviƒá () between 1420 and 1423, forcing the latter to seek the aid of the Ottomans. The Emperors Manuel II and John VIII, along with the King of Poland W≈Çadys≈Çaw II Jagie≈Ç≈Ço, tried to effect a reconciliation between Venice and Sigismund, but in vain. It was only in 1425, when Murad II, freed from threats to his Anatolian possessions, went on the counter-offensive, that Venice itself recognized the necessity of an alliance with Sigismund. Nevertheless, despite additional pressure for a rapprochement from Savoy and Florence, Sigismund refused. This dispute allowed the Ottomans to bring Serbia and Bosnia back into vassalage, and after Murad stopped Sigismund's advance at the Siege of Golubac in 1428, a truce was arranged between the two powers. =Diplomatic and military events, 1425= In the meantime, despite the activities of Loredan around Gallipoli, the situation in Thessalonica was so dire by October 1424 that the Great Council had to authorize the dispatch to the city of between 150 and 200 soldiers, as well as supplies and money. On 13 January 1425, the Venetians decided to equip 25 galleys, an unusually large and expensive undertaking, for the next year; Fantino Michiel was appointed captain-general. The fleet sailed in April, and was tasked both with settling affairs in the Venetian colonies and with reassuring the Thessalonians of Venetian support. Michiel was also instructed to make contact with the Sultan and pledge considerable sums to the Grand Vizier, √áandarlƒ± Ibrahim Pasha, and other members of the Ottoman court, in order to gain a sympathetic hearing. The Republic proposed to restore the salt pans that the Sultan had previously controlled, as well as the tribute of 100,000 aspers that Despot Andronikos had paid. The Venetians refused, however, to allow the Turks in the city to be tried by their own kadi, as had been the case under Andronikos, and insisted on the reinstatement of customs posts at the city gates. Michiel was further tasked with securing the release of Venetian citizens taken during an Ottoman raid into the Morea the previous March, and re-confirming the previous peace treaty of 1419, including, if possible, the restitution of the Marquisate of Bodonitsa to its ruler, Niccolo III Zorzi. In July 1425, ten Venetian galleys under Michiel undertook an expedition east along the shores of Macedonia: the Venetians found Ierissos abandoned by its Ottoman garrison, but full of provisions, which they loaded onto their ships. After setting fire to the town and five other forts in the vicinity, the fleet moved onto Christopolis. The Venetians found the castle held by a 400-strong force of Ottoman sipahis, under the command of Ismail Bey. The first attempt to land, led by Alvise Loredan, was repulsed, and only after all the ships mustered their forces were the Venetians able to overcome Ottoman resistance in a four-hour-long battle: 41 Turks were killed, including Ismail Bey, and 30 taken prisoner. After strengthening the site with a stone wall and earthworks, and leaving a garrison of 80 foot soldiers and 50 crossbowmen to hold it, the fleet departed. The Turks soon returned with a larger force of 10,000‚Äì12,000 men, and after about twenty days, and despite losing around 800 men, the Ottomans stormed the castle. Unable to escape, half the Venetians were killed and the rest taken prisoner. On 21 July Manuel II died, and John VIII formally became Emperor. In response Murad, who was deeply hostile towards John, launched his forces on raids around Thessalonica and Zetouni (Lamia) in Central Greece. At the same time, the Greeks of Thessalonica sent an embassy to the Great Council to complain of violations of their rights by the duke and captain. Among other things, they insisted that the Venetians fortify Kassandreia on the western Chalcidice, to protect the Kassandra Peninsula from Ottoman raids. In response, Michiel occupied the fort of Kassandreia, which he refortified and strengthened by the construction of two smaller forts in the area. He then captured the Platamon Castle, on the opposite side of the Thermaic Gulf, by storm, after setting fire to its main bailey when the Ottoman garrison refused to surrender. Platamon was repaired but probably abandoned soon after, for it is not mentioned again. Following Michiel's request, the Great Council sent 200 men from Padua to man Thessalonica and the forts of Kassandreia, and authorized the captain-general to maintain four galleys in the area. From his letters to the Great Council, it appears that Michiel was simultaneously engaged in negotiations with the Ottomans, as part of which he offered 20,000 aspers a year to the Ottoman governor of Thessaly, Turahan Bey, and to the Grand Vizier. At the same time, according to the Codex Morosini, a pretender claiming to be Mustafa √áelebi arrived in Thessalonica, and gathered a growing following of Turks who considered him to be the true son of Sultan Bayezid. Pseudo-Mustafa launched raids against Murad's forces from the city, but after both Mustafa and the Venetian captain were almost captured during one of these actions, on 3 September the Great Council issued instructions to stop such raids, and keep the gates of the city shut. =Diplomatic and military events, 1426‚Äì1427= Francesco Foscari, Doge of Venice throughout the conflict. Portrait (1457‚Äì1460) by Lazzaro Bastiani In April 1426, Michiel came near to a settlement with the Ottoman governor at Gallipoli, whereby the Republic would keep Thessalonica in exchange for 100,000 aspers a year, the right of disputes between Turks in the city to be settled by their own kadi, and free and untaxed movement of merchants to and from the city. The negotiations foundered again, however, as the Ottomans insisted on their control of Kassandra and Chortiatis, which they intended as springboards for the eventual conquest of the city. At the same time, the Ottomans launched a major attack on the city with reportedly 30,000 men, but the presence of five Venetian galleys in the city, possibly armed with small cannons, helped the defenders repel the attack. According to the report of Loredan and Dandolo to the Great Council, 700 crossbowmen manned the walls, and over 2,000 Turks were killed before the assault failed. On 6 May, a new duke and captain for the city were elected: Paolo Trevisan and Paolo Orio. In July 1426, the new Venetian captain-general, Andrea Mocenigo, was instructed to resume negotiations, but concede to the Ottomans possession of Kassandra and Chortiatis. On the other hand, the peace settlement should be comprehensive, including the Latin lords of the Aegean, who were Venetian citizens and clients. Failing that, Mocenigo was to attack Gallipoli. In August, the Despot of Serbia, Stefan Lazareviƒá, offered his services as mediator. On 28 November, Mocenigo managed to receive Murad's agreement to a peace treaty on the broad lines of the agreement proposed by Michiel, except that Venice would pay an annual tribute of 150,000 aspers and increased annuities for senior members of the Ottoman court, and would surrender Chortiatis. Despite the Republic's desire to conclude a peace treaty, the months and years dragged on without an agreement. Benedetto Emo, appointed ambassador to the Sultan in July 1427 with the express purpose of ratifying the treaty, was replaced in August 1428 by Jacopo Dandolo. Dandolo was instructed, if necessary, to offer a further increase of the tribute to 300,000 aspers, and a total sum of gifts from 10,000‚Äì15,000 ducats and a further 2,000 ducats as annuities; further sums could be offered in exchange for possession of the environs of Thessalonica, Kassandra, and the salt works. Dandolo did not have any more success than his predecessor: the Sultan demanded of him the surrender of Thessalonica, and when Dandolo replied that he did not have authority to do this, the Sultan had him thrown in prison, where he was left to die. =Diplomatic and military events, 1428‚Äì1429= Throughout the confrontation over Thessalonica, the Ottomans launched constant raids against Venetian possessions in Albania. In early spring 1428, the Ottoman fleet launched a major raid against Venetian possessions in Greece: 40 to 65 vessels raided the island of Euboea and took about 700 Venetian citizens prisoner, before going on to raid the environs of the two Venetian outposts of Modon and Coron in the southwestern Morea. When news arrived in Venice on 22 April, even though the previous year's guard fleet under Guido da Canal was still abroad, a guard fleet of 15 galleys was authorized to hunt the Ottoman raiders, under Andrea Mocenigo. In the event, the new fleet did not sail until September, after Canal's fleet was defeated at Gallipoli by a coalition of Ottoman and Christian ships. The Ottoman naval threat became particularly acute at this time due to the defection of the Duke of Naxos, Giovanni II Crispo (). Although a Venetian citizen and vassal of the Republic, mounting Ottoman pressure on his possessions had forced the Great Council to authorize him to enter into a separate peace treaty with the Ottomans, which Crispo duly did. As a result, Crispo was forced to effectively assist the Turks in their own raids, and ceased signalling the Venetians in Euboea of impending Ottoman raids via beacons. In early March 1429, an Ottoman fleet even appeared before Thessalonica, and captured two Venetian vessels. According to the Venetian senator Andrea Suriano, Venice spent on average 60,000 ducats per year in this seemingly fruitless conflict, but the Venetians themselves were hesitant to commit their resources fully to Thessalonica; its proximity to the centre of Ottoman power made their ability to retain it doubtful in the long term, while at the same time, closer to home, Venice was pursuing a conflict with the Duchy of Milan over control of northern Italy. The Republic had long tried to avoid declaring war on the Ottomans, but now it had little choice: Dandolo's imprisonment, the increasing Ottoman naval threat (with the open assistance of the Genoese colonies at Chios and Lesbos), in conjunction with the end of their war with Hungary, made clear to the Venetians that the Sultan was preparing to settle the question of Thessalonica by force. As a result, on 29 March 1429, the Great Council voted an official declaration of war against the Sultan, and ordered more ships to be activated to join the fleet. On 11 May, the pretender Mustafa appeared before the Great Council, and was given a gift of 150 ducats for his services. On 4 June a new duke and captain were elected for Thessalonica, Paolo Contarini and Andrea Donato, after the first three pairs chosen all declined the post, despite the fine attached to refusal; a clear indication of the unwillingness of the Venetian nobles to undertake this unprofitable and perilous task. On 1 July, Mocenigo attacked the Ottoman ships at Gallipoli, but although he led his flagship to break through the palisade protecting the Ottoman anchorage, the other Venetian vessels did not follow, forcing Mocenigo to withdraw with heavy casualties. Even at this point, Venice would not commit its full force to the conflict: when Suriano, as a proponent of the hawkish faction, proposed to arm a fleet of 14 ships and engage in a more decisive policy against the Ottomans in January 1430, the proposal was voted down, even though it was rather modest and clearly inadequate to force the Sultan to come to terms. Instead, the Great Council instructed the new captain-general, Silvestro Morosini, to seek the mediation of the Byzantine Emperor for a settlement on the lines of the previous agreements. Aware of their own weakness, the Venetians tried to form alliances with other regional rulers who feared Ottoman expansionism. Taking advantage of the Ottomans' preoccupation with the Siege of Golubac, Ibrahim II of Karaman () had managed to gain control of the area of Hamid, and in August 1429, through the mediation of King Janus of Cyprus (), the Venetians approached Ibrahim for an alliance against Murad. Rather than resulting in a military alliance, however, the prospect of a Venetian-Cypriot-Karamanid league served to bring the Ottomans closer with the other great Muslim power of the Eastern Mediterranean, the Mamluks of Egypt, and initiate a period where the two states made common cause against Latin presence in the area. The Venetians also tried to influence Murad towards a peace with the threat posed by the ambitions of Timur's son Shahrukh, especially after the latter's defeat of the Kara Koyunlu in September 1429 brought him within striking distance of the Ottomans' Anatolian domains: contemporary rumour ascribed to him not only a desire to restore his father's dominance over the region, but to cross the Ottoman territories into Rumelia, and return to Azerbaijan via the northern shore of the Black Sea. In the event, Shahrukh retired to winter in Azerbaijan, whereupon Murad ordered his general Hamza Bey to lead his forces from Anatolia to Europe in February 1430, and sent him against Thessalonica. Thessalonica under Venetian rule Metropolitan Symeon of Thessalonica, miniature from an 18th-century codex Inside Thessalonica, the siege led to much suffering, and the populace quickly became dissatisfied with their new masters. By the winter of 1426‚Äì1427, conditions in the besieged city approached the point of famine. The Thessalonians were forced to subsist on bread alone, and even that proved problematic‚Äîthe authorities were forced to request more shipments of wheat from Venice when supplies ran dangerously low. The conditions of \\"extreme poverty, death, and destitution\\" made the Greek population more and more restless, and even those who had formerly welcomed the Venetians began to waver. The lack of food even jeopardized the city's defences, since many of the mercenary guards on the walls, paid by Venice with wheat instead of cash, defected to the Turks when their rations were late. This situation became progressively worse, and by the time of the final Ottoman attack in 1430, many soldiers had no weapons because they had sold them for food. The privations of the siege led to an exodus of the city's population, as citizens with the ability to leave sold their possessions and fled to Constantinople, other Venetian-controlled Greek territories, or to the Turks. From a population variously reported at between 20,000‚Äì25,000, or even as many as 40,000, by contemporary Italian sources, it is estimated that only 10,000‚Äì13,000 were left by 1429/30. The Venetian authorities tried to put a stop to this by prohibiting the inhabitants from leaving the city, outlawing \\"all sales, mortgages, and transfers of property, both movable and immovable\\", and destroying the houses and other property‚Äîeven trees‚Äîof people who had left the city. They hoped that the destruction would serve a deterrent to those who remained behind. Coupled with several instances of arbitrariness, speculation, and profiteering on behalf of the Venetian authorities, these measures helped to further alienate the Thessalonians. By April 1425, a Byzantine church official who had had his family flee the city wrote of the \\"enslavement of the city by the Venetians\\", and similar sentiments about Venetian tyranny are echoed in all contemporary Byzantine sources. In their embassy in July 1425, the Thessalonians submitted a list of 21 complaints and demands, including fixed rations of corn for the poor and the lowering of tax dues and suspension of arrears and debt-related punishments for the duration of the siege, since the closing of the gates meant that people could no longer access their fields, which were furthermore devastated by the Turks. In a session on 23 July 1425, the Great Council acceded to many of their demands and requested that its officials respect the customs and rights of the citizens and work together with the local council of twelve nobles in the governance of the city. Whatever the Venetian efforts to secure peace, the Thessalonians were well aware, in the words of the Byzantinist Donald Nicol, that Murad \\"was playing for time\\" and he \\"was never going to be reconciled to the Venetian occupation of the Thessalonica\\". As the historian Apostolos Vacalopoulos put it, the prevailing view quickly became that \\"since Thessalonica was bound sooner or later to fall into Turkish hands, it would be preferable to surrender peacefully there and then, and so avoid the sufferings which would ensue if the Turks had to take the city by force.\\" As conditions inside the city worsened, the pro-surrender current gained ground among the Thessalonians. This is evidenced from the writings of Metropolitan Symeon, who recounts that during one attack in 1425 or 1426, many citizens (including some of those guarding the walls) fled to the Ottomans. Symeon played an important role as a spokesman and leader of the city's populace during the siege. An ardently Hesychast and anti-Latin prelate who had opposed the handover of the city to the Roman Catholic Venetians, fearing their \\"corrupting\\" influence, the Metropolitan tried to strengthen his flock's Orthodox identity against both the Latin Venetians and the Muslim Turks, as well as awaken their will to resist. He organized litanies that paraded the city's icon of the Hodegetria, and delivered sermons about the city's successful delivery from previous sieges through the intervention of her patron, Demetrius of Thessalonica. As a result, he emerged as the leading proponent of resistance, and despite his anti-Latin animus, the Venetians considered him \\"a most loyal servant of the Republic\\". His death in September 1429 contributed to the increasing demoralisation of the city's populace, who considered it an omen of the city's fall. In summer 1429, the Thessalonians sent a second embassy to Venice to complain about the restrictions placed on entry and exit from the city, continued violations of their rights, extortion by the Venetian authorities, the poor supply situation, the neglect of repairing the city's fortifications and the lack of military stores, and the Venetian mercenaries who were in contact with the Turks outside the walls. On 14 July, the Great Council gave mostly reassuring answers to a list of 31 demands, but the increasing dissatisfaction by the Greek population with Venetian rule was evident. The eyewitness John Anagnostes reports that by the winter of 1429, the majority of the population had come to favour a surrender to the Turks. Sultan Murad was aware of the situation inside the walls, and twice sent Christian officers in his service into the city to incite a rebellion against the Venetians. However, as Anagnostes writes, the population was by that time so reduced in number, and divided among itself, that no common cause could be made. Furthermore, the Thessalonians were afraid of the Venetians, as they had recruited a special force of guards, the Tzetarioi, and given them the authority to kill anyone advocating a surrender.  Fall of the city  A squadron of three galleys under Antonio Diedo arrived to reinforce the city on 17 March 1430, but to little avail. A muster of the city's available defenders showed that they sufficed to man only a half or a third of the crenelles, and they were deficient in both armament and morale. News of Murad's approach at the head of an army rumoured to number 190,000 men caused widespread terror among the populace. The Sultan appeared before the city on Sunday, 26 March, shortly after noon. Probably informed of the discontent inside the walls by Greek defectors, the Sultan appears to have expected the mere appearance of his army to force the city to surrender, or to signal an uprising of the populace against the Venetian garrison. In this vein he sent Christian officers to the walls, to call upon the inhabitants to surrender, but they were driven off by arrows from the walls before they had chance to complete their speeches. The Sultan then began preparations to take the city by storm, which lasted for three days. On the 28th, Murad sent another offer of surrender, but this too was rejected. On the same night, a subaltern officer entered the city to inform the Venetian commanders that the Turks had prepared six ships at the Vardar River for use against the Venetian galleys in the harbour, which had been left defenceless since all available forces were concentrated in manning the city wall. Fearing that their retreat would be cut off, the Venetian commanders ordered Diedo and his men to withdraw from the wall to man the ships and the harbour defences. They did not, however, notify the population, and around midnight, Christians from the Ottoman camp approached the walls and announced that the final assault would take place the next day, from land and sea. The news spread throughout the city and panicked the populace, who spent the night in terrified vigil in the churches. The panic spread further when Diedo's withdrawal to the harbour became known. In the absence of other information, the Thessalonians believed that the Venetians were preparing to abandon them and flee. As a result, a number of defenders simply abandoned their positions on the walls and returned to their homes. At dawn on 29 March 1430, the Ottomans launched their attack under the command of Sinan Pasha, the beylerbey (military governor) of Rumelia. The main weight of the attack fell on the less well maintained eastern section of the walls, between the Trigonion and the site of the later Heptapyrgion fortress, where the Sultan himself led the attack. The Ottomans brought siege engines, ladders, and planks forward, and used them to undermine the walls. Ottoman archery proved crucial, for their shots were able to pin down the defenders and hit many who tried to peer over the battlements. As a result, much of the defenders' return fire was blind, and they began slowly abandoning their positions. Finally, at the fourth hour, the Ottoman troops broke through at multiple points along the wall; according to Anagnostes, the first Ottomans climbed the wall in the eastern section, which had been left almost defenceless. As the civilian population was being massacred, the Venetians fled to the harbour as best as they could‚Äî\\"one in his mantle, the other in his undershirt\\" in the words of the report to the Great Council. Many managed to escape to Diedo's ships, and thence to Negroponte. Others were less fortunate: the Venetians lost over 270 men from the galley crews alone. A number of senior officials, including the son of duke Paolo Contarini, and Leonardo Gradenigo, captain of one of the galleys, also fell. Details on the siege were provided by a letter sent by the Venetians of Negroponte to Venice on 2 April, after the refugees from the fall of the city arrived there, and the eyewitness account of John Anagnostes. On their return to Venice, the two Venetian commanders of Thessalonica faced charges of negligence and were imprisoned; they were most likely acquitted, however, for by 1432 both were once again active in the Republic's politics. Foundation inscription with the tughra of Murad II on the Heptapyrgion fortress, built in 1431 on the northeastern corner of the city Following long-standing custom for a city taken by storm, the plundering lasted for three days. According to Anagnostes, 7,000 inhabitants, including himself, were taken captive to be sold in the slave markets of the Balkans and Anatolia, although many were subsequently ransomed by the Despot of Serbia, ƒêuraƒë Brankoviƒá. The city's monuments suffered heavy damage in the sack, particularly the cathedral of Hagios Demetrios, as soldiers ransacked them for precious objects and hidden treasure. This damage was compounded later when the Sultan ordered that marble sections be stripped from them and taken to his capital, Adrianople, to pave a bath. On the fourth day, Sultan Murad entered the city himself and prayed at the Church of the Acheiropoietos, which became the city's first mosque. The Sultan then restored order, evicting the soldiers from the homes they had occupied and returning them to their owners. Only 2,000 of the population were left after the sack, many of whom converted to Islam. The Sultan soon took measures to repopulate the city. He promised to return their properties to those inhabitants who had fled if they returned, and in some cases even ransomed captives from the sack himself. In addition, he brought in Muslim and Christian settlers from other areas of Macedonia. A great number of empty houses were confiscated and given to the settlers, while most of the main churches were converted to mosques. The Turks settled mostly in the upper part of the city, from where they could better control it.  Aftermath  The Venetians were taken by surprise when the city fell; the fleet under Morosini was still sailing off the western coast of Greece. Following their customary strategy, they reacted by sending their fleet to blockade Gallipoli and cut off passage of the Dardanelles. However, the Republic was by now ready to disengage itself from this profitless venture, and soon instructed Morosini to seek peace. In July, Hamza Bey signed a peace treaty with the Venetians (ratified on 4 September) whereby Venice recognized its loss of Thessalonica, restored passage of the Dardanelles, and acknowledged Ottoman overlordship over Patras in the Morea, with an annual tribute of 236 ducats. In exchange, the Venetians secured the Sultan's recognition of their possessions in Albania: Durazzo, Scutari, and Antivari. Following the capture of Thessalonica, the Ottomans went on to extend their rule over western Greece. A few months after the fall of the city Ioannina surrendered to Hamza Bey and Carlo II Tocco accepted Ottoman suzerainty over the southern remnant of the Despotate of Epirus around Arta. Venice moved to place Tocco's island possessions of Zante, Cephalonia, and Leucas under her protection. As a result, for the next half-century, until the end of the First Ottoman‚ÄìVenetian War in 1479, the main arena of confrontation between Venice and the Ottomans was to be Albania, an area of vital importance to both powers, as from there the Ottomans could threaten Italy herself. Thessalonica remained in Ottoman hands until October 1912, when it was captured by the Kingdom of Greece during the First Balkan War. Its remaining Muslim population left the city during the Greco-Turkish population exchange in 1923.

From the mid 1930s, the Falange Exterior, effectively an overseas version of the Spanish Falange, was active throughout Latin America in order to drum up support among Hispanic communities.Stein Ugelvik Larsen, Fascism Outside Europe, Columbia University Press, 2001, p. 806 However, the ideas would soon permeate into indigenous political groups. The term \\"Falangism\\" should not be applied to the military dictatorships of such figures as Alfredo Stroessner, Augusto Pinochet and Rafael Trujillo because while these individuals often enjoyed close relations to Francisco Franco's Spain, their military nature and frequent lack of commitment to national syndicalism and the corporate state mean that they should not be classed as Falangist (although individuals within each regime may have been predisposed towards the ideology). The phenomenon can be seen in a number of movements both past and present. The popularity of Falangism in Latin America declined after the defeat of Fascism and the Axis powers in World War II. Argentina Juan Per√≥n built his power base on his alliance with trade unions in Argentina, many of whom supported syndicalism whilst his government would go on to maintain links with Franco. However, Falangism in the country was largely ill at ease with Peronism until the emergence of the Tacuara Nationalist Movement in the 1960s. This violent movement looked to Jos√© Antonio Primo de Rivera for its inspirationFederico Finchelstein, The Ideological Origins of the Dirty War: Fascism, Populism, and Dictatorship in Twentieth Century Argentina, Oxford University Press, 2017, p. 98 and was also inspired by the works of Julio Meinvielle, himself a strong admirer of Falangism.Philip Rees, Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890, Simon & Schuster, 1990, p. 261 Elsewhere, both Manuel G√°lvez and Juan Carulla endorsed \\"hispanidad\\" and in doing so expressed strong admiration for Falangism, especially Carulla.C.L. Callahan, The Impact of the Spanish Civil War on Argentine Nationalist Intellectual Thought A group called the Falange Aut√©ntica is currently active although it identifies more with the left-wing of Peronism. Bolivia Formed in 1937, the Bolivian Socialist Falange (Falange Socialista Boliviana or FSB) of √ìscar √önzaga gained a strong following amongst former landowners by offering a platform strongly influenced by Franco and Benito Mussolini. The FSB became effective opposition to the Revolutionary Nationalist Movement government although their fortunes would later decline and they were ultimately absorbed into the Nationalist Democratic Action. A breakaway group known as the Movimiento al Socialismo ‚Äì Unzaguista emerged in 1987 under David A√±ez Pedraza. Representing a more left- wing take on Bolivian Falangism, it became moribund before the title, rather than ideology, was effectively appropriated by Evo Morales in 1999 to form the basis of his leftist Movement for Socialism.History of Bolivian Falangism A revivalist group, Frente Socialista de Naciones Bolivianas, was formed by Horacio Poppe in 2000 and they have since emerged as the Falange Neounzaguista, otherwise known as the \\"Whiteshirts\\". Taking their name from √ìscar √önzaga, they have led a recruitment drive in Bolivian universities, although they remain a minor force. Chile In 1935, a group of younger social Christians split from the Conservative Party to form the Falange Nacional. Despite its name, this group was largely made up of progressive and reformist Catholics and bore little resemblance to Spanish Falangism. In its early years, it imitated elements of fascist movements with some of its members wearing uniforms and undergoing paramilitary training. With its progressive economic program (creating an alternative to capitalism, \\"redeeming\\" the proletariat), it was in open conflict with the Catholic high clergy who accused it of disrespecting the Church's leadership and siding with communists. Despite its aim to be a centrist alternative to the left and the right and relatively great public attention, it never received more than 4 percent of the votes. Later, it supported the leftist administration of Juan Antonio R√≠os (1942‚Äì1946) and in 1957 was one of the founding groups of the Christian Democrat Party of Chile.A. Hennessy, 'Fascism and Populism in Latin America', W. Laqueur, Fascism: A Reader's Guide, Harmondsworth: Pelican, 1979, p. 288 One of its former members, Eduardo Frei Montalva, became President of Chile in 1964. Other notable members include Radomiro Tomic and Bernardo Leighton. A more avowedly Falangist group, Movimiento Revolucionario Nacional Sindicalista (Revolutionary National Syndicalist Movement), would appear in 1952, although it did not achieve the influence of the Falange Nacional.S. Cerqueira, 'Chile' in JP Bernard et al, Guide to the Political Parties of South America, Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1973, p. 245 The name has proven durable however as it still organised into the 21st century, albeit on a very minor level.MRNS site (archived version) They also organise a youth movement, Guardia Revolucionaria Nacionalsindicalista. Colombia During the 1930s, future President of Colombia Laureano G√≥mez became an enthusiastic supporter of Falangism, although this fervour had died down somewhat by the time he took power in 1950. Nevertheless, a Falangist group was active in the country during the 1940s.A. Hennessy, 'Fascism and Populism in Latin America', W. Laqueur, Fascism: A Reader's Guide, Harmondsworth: Pelican, 1979, p. 289 A current group exists, the Falange Nacional Patri√≥tica de Colombia, which claims to be active in the National University of Colombia. Recently, they changed their name to Frente Obrero Social Patriota.List of movements (archived version) Costa Rica President of Costa Rica Teodoro Picado Michalski, who governed between 1944 and 1948, was an admirer of Falangism and Somocismo, and even defended Francisco Franco in the United Nations. However, even after the end of the Second World War, the National Delegation of the Falangist Foreign Service recounted Costa Rica as one of the Hispanic countries where there was still an active circle of Falangists. Likewise, Falangist literature was published in Costa Rica between 1937 and 1946 in newspapers like El Nacionalista and La gloria de Espa√±a, while two hours a week of propaganda were broadcast in Costa Rica on the radio programs La Espa√±a y el Mundo. Cuba A minor Cuban Falangist movement existed from 1936 to 1940 under Antonio Avenda√±o and Alfonso Serrano Vilari√±o. This group was effectively ended by a law which barred political groups from making specific reference to the policies of foreign groups. Although the government of Fulgencio Batista maintained good relations with Franco, it was not Falangist and the only real manifestation of Falangism since 1940 was with the minuscule (and probably defunct) La Falange Cubana. Ecuador A group known as the Alianza Revolucionaria Nacionalista Ecuatoriana appeared in 1948, drawing its influences directly from Falangism and synarchism. Under Jorge Luna, they recruited followers from the young upper middle classes and adopted a platform of Christianity, nationalism and anti-communism. However, the group ultimately became more of a street fighting army in support of President Jos√© Mar√≠a Velasco Ibarra rather than a political party.H. Neira, 'Ecuador' in JP Bernard et al, Guide to the Political Parties of South America, Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1973, p. 337 A fringe tendency towards Falangism continues in the Falange Nacional Garciana Ecuatoriana, said to be a newly formed group. El Salvador Under the regime of Arturo Armando Molina, left-wing anti- government guerilla activity became such a feature of Salvadoran life that government agencies began to fund far-right guerilla groups to oppose the leftists. One of the first of these was the Fuerzas Armadas de Liberacion Nacional ‚Äì Guerra de Exterminacion, better known by the acronym FALANGE, set up in 1975 with the stated aim of exterminating \\"all communists and their collaborators\\". Carrying out 38 murders in one week in October 1975 alone, the group changed its name to the Union Guerrera Blanca in 1976, de-emphasising its Falangist ideology whilst continuing its initial role of assassination of left-wing targets.James Dunkerley, The Long War: Dictatorship & Revolution in El Salvador, Junction Books, 1982, pp 103-104 Mexico Mexican synarchism, which combined Catholicism with anti-communism, bore some of the hallmarks of Falangism and looked to Franco (amongst others) for inspiration. Its political representatives, the National Synarchist Union, became influential during the late 1930s. Alongside this indigenous variation a wholly mimetic group, the Falange Espa√±ola Tradicionalista was formed in the country by Spanish merchants based there who opposed the consistent support given to the Republican side in the Spanish Civil War by L√°zaro C√°rdenas. The group neither sought nor had influence outside this immigrant population, however.A. Hennessy, 'Fascism and Populism in Latin America', W. Laqueur, Fascism: A Reader's Guide, Harmondsworth: Pelican, 1979, p. 283 Mexican far-right groups often emphasise Orgullo Criollo (\\"Creole Pride\\"), which underlines the celebration of their links to Spain and the hispanidad culture.Creole Pride flag and description Nicaragua Falangist influence was felt in the country during the later 1930s, particularly in the Colegio Centro Am√©rica in Managua where the ideology was widespread. However, such activity was suppressed after 1941 as Nicaragua took a decidedly pro-United States line after the attack on Pearl Harbor.John Gunther, Inside Latin America, 1941, pp. 141-2 Peru A minor Falange Per√∫ exists and claims the support of Spanish Falangists.Falange Peru website Puerto Rico Around the time of the Spanish Civil War, the Falange was heavily active amongst the 8,000 or so Spanish citizens on the island, with an official branch of the Falange organised in San Juan. This group officially disavowed any involvement in local politics, although it was scrutinised closely by the FBI during the Second World War.John Gunther, Inside Latin America, 1941, pp. 434-5 Two very minor Falangist groups have been active in the drive for Puerto Rican independence. The first of these was the Falange Boricua, who have claimed that they were banned on 7 May 2000 after leader Walter Lozano was arrested attempting to blockade U.S. military bases on the island.Report on the incident from a pro-Falangist website. Note - no neutral reports of the incident exist They have since been refounded as the Movimento Nacional Sindicalista de Puerto Rico. Venezuela Enrique Parra Bozo, who was noted for his admiration of Franco as well as his Catholicism and anti-communism, led the Partido Aut√©ntico Nacionalista along Falangist lines. The group lent its support to the military regime of Marcos P√©rez Jim√©nez and even attempted, though unsuccessfully, to nominate him as their candidate for the 1963 presidential election.L.F. Manigat, 'Venezuela' in JP Bernard et al, Guide to the Political Parties of South America, Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1973, p. 568 A minor group, the Falange Venezolana, have been active in the 21st century and look to Primo de Rivera, Ramiro Ledesma Ramos, L√©on Degrelle and Corneliu Zelea Codreanu for their inspiration.FV website (archived version) See also * Fascism in South America * Latin America during World War II References Category:Falangism Category:History of Central America Category:History of South America Category:Fascism in South America ","title":"Falangism in Latin America"},{"id":"11784472","text":"The Motorsports Association of India (MAI) was the national sporting authority (ASN) of the F√©d√©ration Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) in India for a period between 2000 and 2008.

Both its scientific name and origin have been the subject of much confusion, with much of the literature referring to it as either Rubus procerus or Rubus discolor, and often mistakenly citing its origin as western European.Ceska, A.

In some areas, the plant is cultivated for its berries, but in many areas it is considered a noxious weed and an invasive species. Description Rubus armeniacus is a perennial plant that bears biennial stems (\\"canes\\") from the perennial root system. In its first year a new stem grows vigorously to its full length of 4‚Äì10 m, trailing along the ground or arching up to 4 m high. The stem is stout, up to 2‚Äì3 cm diameter at the base, and green. The canes can turn more red/purple if they are exposed to bright sunlight. This is common in the summer. The leaves on first year shoots are 7‚Äì20 cm long, palmately compound with either three or more commonly five leaflets. The leaflets are moderately serrated. Flowers are not produced on first year shoots. In its second year, the stem does not grow longer, but produces several side shoots, which bear smaller leaves with three leaflets (rarely a single leaflet). These leaflets are oval-acute, dark green above and pale to whitish below, with a toothed margin, and thorns along the midrib on the underside. The flowers are produced in late spring and early summer on panicles of 3‚Äì20 together on the tips of the second-year side shoots, each flower 2‚Äì2.5 cm diameter with five white or pale pink petals. The flowers are bisexual (perfect) containing both male and female reproductive structures. The fruit in botanical terminology is not a berry, but an aggregate fruit of numerous drupelets, 1.2‚Äì2 cm diameter, ripening black or dark purple. Both first and second year shoots are spiny, with short, stout, curved, sharp spines. Mature plants form a tangle of dense arching stems, the branches rooting from the node tip when they reach the ground.Francis, J. K. (2003). Rubus discolor Weihe & Nees. pdf file Cultivation =Berry crop= An example of the berries, showing both unripe (green then red) and one ripe berry. The species was introduced to Europe in 1835 and to Australia and North America in 1885. It was valued for its fruit, similar to that of common blackberries (Rubus fruticosus and allies) but larger and sweeter, making it a more attractive species for both domestic and commercial fruit production. The immature fruits are smaller, red, and hard with a much more sour taste. The cultivars \\"Himalayan Giant\\" and \\"Theodore Reimers\\" are particularly commonly planted. Rubus armeniacus was used in the cultivation of the Marionberry cultivar of blackberry. = Cover = When established for several years, if left alone, Rubus armeniacus can grow into a large cluster of canes. These thickets of can oftentimes provide good nesting grounds for birds, and help to provide places to rest/hide for other slightly larger mammals, such as rabbits, squirrels, beavers, etc. =Invasive species= Rubus armeniacus soon escaped from cultivation and has become an invasive species in most of the temperate world.National list of naturalised invasive and potentially invasive garden plants (Australia) pdf fileUSDA Plant Profile: Rubus armeniacus Because it is so hard to contain, it quickly gets out of control, with birds and other animals eating the fruit and then spreading the seeds.The Nature Conservancy, Controlling Himalayan Blackberry in the Pacific Northwest by Jonathan Soll It is especially established West of the Cascades in the American Pacific Northwest. It does well in riparian zones due to the abundance of other species in these areas, which allows it to go relatively unnoticed until it has had a chance to establish itself. The shrub spreads through rhizomes underground, making it very difficult to remove. Unlike other invasive species, this plant can easily establish itself and continue to spread in ecosystems that have not experienced a disturbance. Cutting the canes to the ground, or burning thickets of Rubus armeniacus are ineffective removal strategies. The best practices for removal include digging up the rhizomes and connecting underground structures, and herbicides. Broken roots can resprout, making manual removal extra labor intensive, and glyphosate herbicides are largely ineffective with this plant. The most labor friendly and cost- effective way to remove this plant in smaller-scale infestations is to cut it as close to the ground as possible and then apply a drop or two of a triclopyr-based herbicide to the cut.

Ingrid Bergman and George Sanders play Katherine and Alex Joyce, an English married couple whose trip to Italy unexpectedly undermines their marriage. The film was written by Rossellini and Vitaliano Brancati, but is loosely based on the 1934 novel Duo by Colette. Although the film was an Italian production, its dialogue was in English. The first theatrical release was in Italy under the title Viaggio in Italia; the dialogue had been dubbed into Italian. Journey to Italy is considered by many to be Rossellini's masterpiece, as well as a seminal work of modernist cinema due to its loose storytelling. In 2012, it was listed by Sight & Sound magazine as one of the fifty greatest films ever made. Plot Alex and Katherine Joyce (Sanders and Bergman) are a couple from England who have traveled by car to Italy to sell a villa near Naples that they have recently inherited from \\"Uncle Homer\\". The trip is intended as a vacation for Alex, who is a workaholic businessman given to brusqueness and sarcasm. Katherine is more sensitive, and the journey has evoked poignant memories of a poet friend, Charles Lewington, now deceased. Much of the running time of Voyage to Italy is uneventful. The opening scene shows Katherine and Alex Joyce simply conversing as they drive through the Italian countryside; the only incident is momentary, when they slow for a herd of cattle in the road. Shortly after they arrive in Naples, the film follows them as they are given a lengthy, room-by- room tour of Uncle Homer's villa by its caretakers, Tony and Natalie Burton. The film subsequently follows Katherine on several days as she tours Naples without Alex. On the third day of her visit, she tours the large, ancient statues at the Naples Museum. On the sixth day she visits the Phlegraean Fields with their volcanic curiosities. On another day she accompanies Natalie Burton to the Fontanelle cemetery, with its stacks of unidentified, disinterred human skulls that are adopted and honored by local people. Mulvey identifies several of the locales near Naples used in filming. Within days of their arrival, the couple's relationship becomes strained amid mutual misunderstandings and a degree of jealousy on both sides. Alex dismisses Lewington as \\"a fool\\". The two begin to spend their days separately, and Alex takes a side trip to the island of Capri. On the last day of the film, they impetuously agree to divorce. Tony Burton suddenly appears, insisting that they go with him to Pompeii for an extraordinary opportunity. There the three of them witness the discovery of another couple who had been buried in ashes during the eruption of Mount Vesuvius nearly two thousand years earlier.Giuseppe Forelli discovered that one could make plaster castings of the cavities left by the bodies of victims; the castings preserve the form of the body and its bones. See Katherine is profoundly disturbed, and she and Alex leave Pompeii only to be caught up in the procession for Saint Gennaro in Naples. The afternoon's experiences ‚Äî seemingly miraculously ‚Äî rekindle their love for each other. Katherine asks Alex, \\"Tell me that you love me!,\\" and he responds \\"Well, if I do, will you promise not to take advantage of me?\\" The film concludes with a crane shot showing the continuing religious procession. Cast * Ingrid Bergman as Katherine Joyce. Bergman, a famed actress of the era, was then married to Rossellini. Journey to Italy was her third film with him. Some critics have suggested that their films together have autobiographical elements drawn from Bergman's and Rossellini's lives and their relationship. * George Sanders as Alexander 'Alex' Joyce (credited as Georges Sanders). Sanders was a well-known actor of the era who had won an Academy Award in 1951. * Maria Mauban as Marie (credited as Marie Mauban). * Anna Proclemer as a prostitute. Proclemer, a noted actress, was married at the time to the film's screenwriter, Vitaliano Brancati. * Paul Muller as Paul Dupont. * Leslie Daniels as Tony Burton (billed as Anthony La Penna). Burton is an Englishman living in Italy and married to Natalie. The Burtons are acting as caretakers for Uncle Homer's villa. * Natalia Ray as Natalie Burton (credited as Natalia Rai). Natalie is an Italian woman married to Tony. * Jackie Frost as Betty. Production The film originally was intended as an adaptation of the French writer Colette's novel Duo; Rossellini was, however, unable to get the rights to the novel, and was forced to draft a screenplay that differed sufficiently from the novel. Brunette's chapter incorporates a lengthy, close reading of the film. Rossellini and his co-author, Vitaliano Brancati, also apparently drew on a script entitled New Vine, by Antonio Pietrangeli, which described the argumentative relationship of an English couple touring Naples in a Jaguar automobile. See also a synopsis of Gallagher's chapter: The film's storyline about Charles Lewington, the deceased poet who'd been in love with Katherine Joyce, is considered to be an allusion to the short story \\"The Dead\\" by James Joyce. Rossellini's directorial style was very unusual. The actors did not receive their lines until shortly before filming of a particular scene, leaving them little if any chance to prepare or rehearse. George Sanders' autobiography Memoirs of a Professional Cad (1960) tellingly describes Rossellini's methods of direction and their effects on the actors and production team. Theatrical releases The film was completed in 1953, but it took 18 months to arrange for distribution of the film in Italy. It was released in 1954 with the title Viaggio in Italia, with a running time of 105 minutes. This book is a translation of The receipts and critical reception were poor. The film had been dubbed into Italian, and now is used as an example of \\"monstrous\\" difficulties with dubbing. In April 1955, an 88-minute version of the film, in English, was released in France as L'Amour est le plus fort. There was little interest in the film in the U.S. and Britain despite the fact that the film had been made in English with noted actors in the leads. An American version, with an 80-minute running time, had a limited release in 1955 with the title Strangers. Los Angeles release August 31, 1955 (80 minutes). In Britain, a cut version (70 minutes) was released in 1958 under the title The Lonely Woman. A 97-minute Italian language version with English subtitles was released at some point; it isn't clear why this version was created, given that the film's dialogue was in English, and the Italian language version had been dubbed from that. Reception and significance Journey to Italy performed badly at the box office and was largely a critical failure. It had a profound influence, however, on New Wave filmmakers working in the 1950s and 1960s. As described six decades later by film critic John Patterson: \\"French critics at the Cahiers du Cin√©ma ‚Äì the likes of Jean-Luc Godard, Jacques Rivette, Fran√ßois Truffaut and Claude Chabrol ‚Äì all saw it as the moment when poetic cinema grew up and became indisputably modern. Journey to Italy is thus one wellspring of the French New Wave. A film convulsed by themes of sterility, petrification, pregnancy and eternity, it finds its echo in such death-haunted Nouvelle Vague masterpieces as Chabrol's Le Boucher and Truffaut's La Chambre Verte.\\" Filmmaker Martin Scorsese talks about the film and his impressions of it in his own film My Voyage to Italy (1999). Today, Journey to Italy generally is regarded as a landmark film. Critic Geoff Andrew referred to it as \\"a key stepping stone on the path to modern cinema\\" in its shift away from neorealism, and A.O. Scott notes Rossellini's \\"way of dissolving narrative into atmosphere, of locating drama in the unspoken inner lives of his characters\\"; because Alex and Katherine are not developed through a conventional plot but instead spend lengthy amounts of time in boredom and dejection, the film frequently is cited as a major influence on the dramas of Michelangelo Antonioni and later works about modern malaise. The film is ranked 41st in the 2012 survey of film critics conducted by Sight & Sound magazine, under the auspices of the British Film Institute. It is ranked 71st in an overall aggregation of several \\"greatest films\\" surveys. \\"77. Voyage in Italy (Rossellini, 1953)\\" Home media and restoration There have been several releases of Journey to Italy for home video. In 2013, the Criterion Collection released a newly restored version as a region 1 DVD. The feature film runs 85 minutes. Also released as a Blu-ray disk. This version is based on restoration work at Cineteca di Bologna and , which was reviewed very favorably by Glenn Erickson. An earlier DVD version was released in 2003 as a region 2 DVD by the British Film Institute. The feature film runs 80 minutes. It was reviewed then by Gary Tooze. A VHS tape version was released in 1992. The feature film runs 80 minutes. References Further reading  A contemporary, highly favorable review.

An early victim of shoreline erosion, the cupola and gables are preserved at museums. This light should not be confused with Upper Cedar Point Light or Lower Cedar Point Light, both of which stood in the Potomac River. History Cedar Point did not receive a light until 1896, based upon an 1888 request from the lighthouse board and an appropriation in 1894. A two- story brick house was constructed with an attached tower, by far the latest example of such construction on the Chesapeake Bay. Erosion at the point was exacerbated by dredging for sand nearby, and in the 1920s the light sat on a tiny island, leading to its abandonment in 1928 in favor of a beacon. This beacon was eventually abandoned as well in the mid 1950s, leaving on a buoy in deeper water off the point. The land at the point was acquired by the United States Navy in 1958. The lighthouse was declared eligible for the National Register of Historic Places in 1979, and three years later the cupola was removed and taken to the base museum at the Patuxent Naval Air Station. Demolition was approved, and the heavily damaged remains were dismantled in 1996, with the gables and some bricks sent to the Calvert Marine Museum for the construction of a pavilion.

Reaching lengths of up to 24 metres (79 ft) it is smaller than the other commonly recognized subspecies, B. m. musculus and B. m. intermedia, the former reaching 28 m (92 ft) and the latter 30 m (98 ft), hence its common name. The pygmy blue whale is the only one of the three identifiable subspecies to be found regularly in tropical waters. It occurs from the sub- Antarctic zone to the southern Indian Ocean and southwestern Pacific Ocean, breeding in the Indian and South Atlantic oceans, and travelling south to above the Antarctic to feed, although they very rarely cross the Antarctic Convergence. A fourth subspecies, B. m. indica, was identified by Blyth in 1859 in the northern Indian Ocean, but difficulties in identifying distinguishing features for this subspecies lead to it being used a synonym for B. m. musculus. It is now thought to be the same subspecies as the pygmy blue whale. Records for Soviet catches seem to indicate the female adult size is closer to that of the pygmy blue than B. m. musculus, although the populations of B. m. indica and B. m. brevicauda appear to be discrete, and the breeding seasons differ by almost six months. Pygmy blue whales are believed to be more numerous than the other subspecies, possibly making up half of all blue whales alive today. Although the designation is widely accepted, because of the relatively healthy stocks of pygmy blues compared to the other subspecies, The Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada has questioned whether the subclassification of the pygmy blue whale has been driven by the interests of the whaling industry.  Physical characteristics  According to observations made since the subspecies was first described in 1966, the pygmy blue whale differs from the \\"true\\" blue whales in a number of physical characteristics. It has: *broader and shorter baleen plates, *a shorter tail, and hence a proportionately longer body in front of the dorsal fin, *a larger head relative to body size, and, *a heavier body weight compared to other blue whales of the same length.T.

Pygmy blue whales also tend to be darker than the other subspecies of blue whales, and the shape of their blowhole is different.  Evolutionary history  The pygmy blue whale formed from a founder group of Antarctic blue whales about 20,000 years ago, around the Last Glacial Maximum. This is likely because blue whales were driven north by expanding ice, and some have stayed there ever since.

The squadron goes by the motto of \\"Seek and Destroy\\" and the mascot is the brahminy kite. History Set up in 1973 with the commissioning of the SH 7 Skyvan 3M into the service of SADC. In 1993, the squadron found a new chapter to their successful career when they began operating the Fokker F50 MPA and UTL. With this move, the squadron's mascot was changed from the gannet to the brahminy kite, which is also reflected as the current centerpiece of the squadron's crest. As of September 2008, the Squadron has maintain an impressive safety record of over 124,000 accident-free flying hours, spanning a period of 35 years since the squadron's inception. Roles and Missions The primary role of the F-50 is to provide dedicated wide area maritime air surveillance for search and rescue operations, aeromedical evacuations and the transportation of personnel. The 121Sqn is unique in the RSAF, it is the first RSAF squadron to be crewed by both RSAF and RSN personnels as the pilots are drawn from the RSAF while the equipment/system specialists are from the RSN. As such, the F-50 MPA is part of a MINDEF system that comprises both Republic of Singapore Air Force and Republic of Singapore Navy assets that are capable of operations in tandem for seeking out and destroying a naval surface or sub- surface target, they can be quickly re-armed with the Harpoon Anti-ship missiles or EuroTorp A244/S ASW torpedoes as and when they are required to. The other squadron which integrate both Naval and Air operations are personnel from 123 Squadron with the Seahawks.https://www.mindef.gov.sg/web/portal/mindef/news-and-events/latest- releases/article-detail/2011/january/2011jan18-news- releases-01098/!ut/p/z0/fY25DsIwEES_hSKlteuIswyhAMTRBBTcoAUWMIQNJOb6e8xVQvlGM2_AQApG6GI35GwulHmemfq8Me7EXayGo3Et0RhNk2RQa496k0Yd- mD-F7zB7k4nE4FZ5uL45iA9WFnxWr1YXIDb_MABCl9LRbJSfPFpGWBGjkunCs6YSvZBiFoHuCM5U3F_owfdVK_pt6dQY6v5PA6LYTzcgDmS2yor6xzS5wbSj- KNvxXHvVncr1HlAQOVECU!/ The squadron covers a wide spectrum of operations round the clock.

Like other breeds of Turkmen horse, it is named for the Turkmen tribe that raised it, the Iomud. Both the name of the horse and the name of the Turkmen clan may be spelt in many ways, including Iomud, Yomud, Yamud and Yomut. The Iomud horse is raised in Turkmenistan, particularly in the velayat of Da≈üoguz; in Uzbekistan; in Karakalpakstan (now part of Uzbekistan), particularly in the Khwarezm region; and in Iraq, Iran and Turkey. Unlike the Akhal-Teke, it usually kept in herds in desert or semi-desert areas.  History  Like other breeds of Turkmen horse ‚Äì including the Akhal-Teke, the Ersari, the Goklan, the Salor and the Sarik ‚Äì the Iomud breed is named for the Turkmen tribe that formed it, the Iomud. The Iomud people occupy the northern part of modern Turkmenistan, from the eastern shores of the Caspian Sea in the west to the area of Da≈üoguz, on the northern edge of the Karakum Desert, in the north-east. They are principally concentrated in the velayats of Balkan and Da≈üoguz, and this is considered the area of origin of the Iomud horse. The early history of the Iomud breed, like that of Turkmen horses in general, is not clear. The qualities of Turkmen horses, and the differences between the various breeds, were recognised by western travellers in the area in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Clement Augustus de Bode wrote in 1848 that the Tekke horses had the best endurance, and were preferred to pure-bred Arabs, while the Iomud and the Goklan were faster and more lightly built. In the twentieth century, numbers of the Iomud breed declined. In 1980, in the Soviet era, the total number was recorded as 964, of which 616 were considered pure-bred. In 1983 stud farms were set up with the aim of increasing the number of breeding mares from 140 to about 250. A conservation farm was also established in the Gyzyletrek district, in south-west Turkmenistan. The Iomud contributed significantly to the development of the Lokai breed in Tajikistan.  Characteristics  Iomud horses have remarkable endurance. According to local information collected in 1937, they could cover the from Da≈üoguz to Etrek in seven days. They can carry without difficulty in mountain or desert terrain. Iomud horses are usually grey or chestnut; golden chestnut and black can occur. Stallions stand about , mares a little less. Thoracic circumference (girth) is about , cannon bone measurement about The profile is straight or slightly convex, the legs fine and often bowed; the mane and tail are sparse, and the skin is delicate.

The company serves clients in many fields, such as film, gaming, legal and healthcare fields. , TransPerfect is \\"the largest privately owned language services provider, with offices in over 100 cities worldwide\\" and more than 6000 employees. History TransPerfect's founders Elizabeth Elting and Phil Shawe met in a New York University (NYU) dormitory room and founded the company in 1992. With no external financing, TransPerfect grew from a two-person dormitory-based operation into one of the 125 largest privately held companies in the New York area. In 1998 the firm began expanding worldwide. In 1999, TransPerfect established a technology division, launching Translations.com with several million dollars in outside investment to meet the demand for software and website translations. In 2004, they bought out their investors and merged TransPerfect and Translations.com. nm The company grew using primarily live translation services from multilingual people all over the world. In 2003, TransPerfect acquired Wordfast, which was initially developed as a platform-independent translation memory software. While TransPerfect used the Wordfast product under license, it remained a wholly separate entity that is operated by the software‚Äôs founder Yves Champollion. As its revenues grew to nearly $65 million in 2005, the firm continued making key acquisitions. TransPerfect acquired Crimson Language Services, a Boston based medical and other highly-regulated industries translation company. Adding to its business, TransPerfect in 2012 acquired Digital Reef, and entered the electronic discovery business. In 2013, the company acquired Vasont Systems, a component content management system that helps companies publish multilingual technical documentation, product manuals, and other business information. From 2015-2018, TransPerfect was involved in a legal dispute between its founders. It closed 2016 with sales at $546 million, and its sales for the full year 2017 totaled $614.8m. Two months after the conclusion of three-year lawsuit that ended with Shawe becoming the sole owner, the company posted its most successful month's revenues in June 2018, at $62 million. It posted $337 million for the first half of 2018, which was up nearly 20% from 2017. In 2019 the company made acquisitions of media localization companies in the areas gaming and streaming services, and opened a new 900 seat facility in Arizona. In December, Shawe signed a six year agreement with the Nashville Music City Bowl for the naming rights to the college football game. Legal activities =Founders Dispute= Following an apparent difficulty in communications between one another, Elting considered her options regarding her 50% ownership of the company. Among the issues she was concerned with was the value of her 50% ownership share. Elting sought relief from the legal system. Shawe saw that as an attempt by Elting to use the courts to help her negotiate an exit policy. In 2014, Elting sought to remove Shawe as an officer of TransPerfect Translations International, Inc. (TPI). Elting sought an injunction barring Shawe from conducting any managerial activity related to TransPerfect and sought the dissolution of TransPerfect, alleging that Shawe had engaged in \\"erratic and abusive behavior\\". New York State Supreme Court Justice Melvin Schweitzer dismissed the case, suggesting the two needed to work it out privately and not seek remedy from a court. =Forced Sale= The suit was then taken to the Delaware Chancery where Elting reissued her complaint, and Shawe alleged that Elting had breached her fiduciary duties by not moving ahead with certain business- related opportunities, such as leases, acquisitions, and diverting funds for her own personal use. In August 2015, The Chancellor of the Delaware Chancery Court, Andre Bouchard, decided to have a third-party sell the shares of the company in a public auction. Former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani chimed in and suggested that the court decision in Delaware would harm Delaware's status as a popular business incorporation state. NY Justice Schweitzer also publicly commented on the case in Delaware, saying, \\"I was kind of shocked at how extreme the result was... The company is still doing phenomenally well and I thought there were steps that should have been taken short of ordering a sale. That's what I would have done if I still had the case.\\" The argument against the Chancellor has been the misapplication of Delaware General Corporation Law, clause 226 that authorizes the sale of a company when it faces financial default and other catastrophic issues. Here, as the company has only proven to do even better each year, even during this lawsuit period. The defendants have argued that the company has not suffered and that the only remedy is the appointment of tie-breaking board member to help move issues along. Following Bouchard's decision, Shawe sought an appeal of the ruling and the oral argument was held on January 18, 2017. For the appeal, Professor Alan Dershowitz argued for Shirley Shawe, a 1% owner in the company. Dershowitz argued that Chancellor Bouchard's decision was tantamount to an illegal constitutional taking. Delaware Chief justice Leo Strine argued back to Dershowitz that he had no right to bring that up since it was not in the initial case, and the two argued over the law. The appeal affirmed Bouchard's decision. Shawe and Dershowitz then suggested that they will petition the U.S. Supreme Court for certiorari. In March 2017, Shirley Shawe announced that she would attempt to break the manufactured corporate deadlock to end the legal case and stop the court imposed sale, and laid out a plan to vote her single share with Elting's 50%, giving Elting control to appoint five board members with staggered terms, making it mathematically improbable for deadlock to ensue. Elting's team rejected that offer, advising that there was already a sale order in place. On June 2, 2017, the Delaware Chancellor heard the case of Shirley Shawe's proposal to grant the votes of her 1% to Elting to cede control, and simultaneously heard the motion by Elting to sanction Mrs. Shawe for trying to settle the case without the public sale. Bouchard appeared unsettled by the amount of media that this case has garnered, and stated that this case should settle out of court. During the hearing, he challenged Elting asking her why she would not accept control of the company as she has stated she wanted during the initial case and the appeal, and her attorney intervened and stated that she would not run a company where Philip Shawe owned 49%. Judge Bouchard chose to order mediation while still pursuing the public sale order., and stated that he had appointed former Chancellor Bill Chandler to mediate, and would not rule on either motion for at least 30 days. After the final round of bidding for the company on November 10 passed, late in the evening on November 14, 2017, Delaware State Senator Colin Bonini wrote an email to Chancellor Andre Bouchard asking to be permitted to oversee the review of bids. Bonini cited questions of \\"conflicts that would make the auction process appear 'rigged or invalid,'\\" dealing with Credit Suisse, the investment bank running the TransPerfect auction, and the law firm Skadden Arps, and one of the bidders that was allegedly intertwined with both. Bouchard notified the parties that he would not take any action on the letter, but entered it into the public record; several media then reported the letter and the allegations. With more than two years of litigation and legal questions over whether a court can order the auction of a successful private company that is not in distress or bankruptcy, the court appointed custodian, Robert Pincus, a partner at Skadden Arps, announced in a November 20, 2017 email to the employees of the company, that Philip Shawe was the successful bidder in the public auction, and that he was in final talks to bring this matter to an end. =Billing Disputes= The company has since been contending that Pincus has continued to submit legal bills more than one year after his role ended in 2018, and attorneys for the company are seeking to have the legal bills itemized and explained, which Bouchard has continuously denied. On July 10, 2019, one last issue of TransPerfect was raised before the Chancery court. Elting sued one more time for legal bills that she claimed were owed to her by the company under her indemnification clause, while the company maintained that it paid what was due and that these expenses fell outside of the agreement. Another set of legal disputes rising from issues related to the protracted sale order case in Delaware, TransPerfect and Shawe had claimed that Skadden Arps had been billing excessively for work it would not explain, and the Chancellor granted the law firm's fee requests without Transperfect having an opportunity to review it. Chancellor Bouchard had sided with the law firm and continued to permit it to submit invoices for unspecified work. Shawe contended that the invoices be itemized and made public, but the Chancellor agreed with Skadden that by requiring a law firm to disclose what it was billing in a public forum could harm the ability for companies registered in Delaware to protect its interests. The Chancellor agreed and mandated that the invoices must remain hidden, but lawyers for Shawe and TransPerfect could view limited details and then, within a certain time frame, submit disputes to items it takes issue with. As a result, Skadden Arps has included in its billing to TransPerfect, charges to defend its interests against Shawe's requests to see itemized invoices. =Employee group forms to protect company= Included in this case has been a campaign waged by a group that calls itself Citizens for a Pro-Business Delaware to lobby the legislature to change the chancery rules regarding the forced sale of a private, well performing company. The group claims over 1200 members. \\"Citizens \\" built a website, has run television commercials, taken billboard and newspaper ads, petitioned elected leaders and held press conferences to press the issue of their concern for the jobs that may be lost and the impact this decision would have on Delaware's ability to continue attracting new companies to incorporate in the state. =Controversial legal issues= There have been charges of unethical actions by Elting's law firm Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel, which was sanctioned by the Chancery Court for \\"repeatedly instruct[ing] a witness not to answer questions. A defamation suit was filed by Shirley Shawe against Kramer Levin, claiming that its lead attorney on the case ‚Äúcrossed the line‚Äù by making false statements in connection with the Delaware sale case that ‚Äúwere intended to damage Shawe‚Äôs business and personal reputation,‚Äù while talking to a reporter about the case. Citing that same interview, attorney Philip Kaufman was also accused of contradicting himself when he argued before the appeal court from what he claimed to the reporter. Ms. Shawe ran a series of TV ads highlighting the varying sets of comments made by Kaufman and the video was posted to YouTube.

Consideration of civilian casualties was incorporated into NATO's planning and targeting process. Targets were \\"looked at in terms of their military significance in relation to the collateral damage or the unintended consequence that might be there\\", according to General Henry Shelton, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Critics of the campaign have suggested that incidents were the inevitable result of NATO's policy of restricting its pilots to bombing from 15,000 feet or above for the sake of avoiding NATO deaths.

Dubrava prison massacre Starting on May 19, 1999, NATO forces bombed the town of Istok, killing three prisoners and a prison guard that day. Two days later, NATO forces struck the prison complex again, with at least 19 prisoners being killed from the airstrikes, according to Human Rights Watch. Subsequent to the lethal airstrikes, special units from the Yugoslavia's Ministry of Internal Affairs along with various criminals selected by the special forces carried out a false flag operation, during which the prisoners were massacred by firearms, after which state agency Tanjug claimed that all of the prison victims were killed by the airstrikes. = May 29‚Äì31, 1999: Morava region, Novi Pazar, and road bombings= Commemoration of the victims of the Varvarin Massacre On May 29, 1999, the Prizren-Brezovica road was subject to NATO airstrikes. A chauffeur was killed driving in a convoy of journalists, and three more were injured. At 1:05 pm local time on the following day, 1999, 10 civilians were killed when NATO bombers mounted a daylight raid on a bridge over the Great Morava river in Varvarin. The streets and bridge had more people than usual as Trinity Sunday was observed that day. NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said the alliance had bombed a \\"legitimate designated military target\\". Surdulica was bombed for the second time on the night of May 30‚Äì31, 1999, when NATO airstrikes destroyed a sanatorium and a retirement home. Human Rights Watch published the names of the 23 civilians killed in the sanatorium. On May 31, 1999, a residential building was struck by a NATO bomb in Novi Pazar, killing 11 civilians. On the same day, Human Rights Watch recorded that airstrikes killed three civilians in three separated incidents throughout central and southern Serbia; in Vranje, on the \\"Ra≈°ka bridge\\", and in Dra≈æevac.  Human Rights Watch analysis  A street in Belgrade destroyed by NATO bombs Human Rights Watch documented and evaluated the impact and effects of the NATO military operation, and confirmed 90 incidents in which civilians died as a result of NATO bombing. These included attacks where cluster bombs were dropped. In 1999, it was estimated that 488‚Äì527 Yugoslav civilians died as a result of NATO bombing. The report also criticized Pentagon and NATO officials for a lack of attention to the issue of civilian deaths, suggesting \\"a resistance to acknowledging the actual civilian effects and an indifference to evaluating their causes.\\"  NATO strategy and claims  From the very beginning of Operation Allied Force, minimizing civilian casualties was a major declared NATO concern. According to NATO, consideration of civilian casualties was fully incorporated into the planning and targeting process. All targets were \\"looked at in terms of their military significance in relation to the collateral damage or the unintended consequence that might be there,\\" General Shelton said on April 14: \\"Then every precaution is made...so that collateral damage is avoided.\\" According to Lt. Gen. Michael Short, \\"collateral damage drove us to an extraordinary degree...[and] committed hours of [my] day dealing with the allies on issues of collateral damage.\\"  See also  *Casualty recording *Humanitarian Law Centre *Civilian casualties during the NATO intervention in Libya Notes * Zmaj Jova street is named after Jovan Jovanoviƒá Zmaj.

It is a cross-breed between Thoroughbred stallions and local and imported mares of various types. It is raised mainly by the Indian Army as a cavalry mount; it is also used by the Indian Police Service, as a polo pony, and for recreational and competitive riding. History In the 19th century the Indian cavalry used mainly Arab horses. Later, large numbers of Walers, at that time considered the best cavalry horses, were imported from Australia. In the twentieth century Thoroughbred stock was used to sire half-bloods. The Thoroughbred stallion Thomas Jefferson was imported from Britain and stood both at the army stud at Babugarh and at the remount depot of Saharanpur, both in Uttar Pradesh. At the Partition of India in 1947, India retained four French and eight British Thoroughbreds. The mares are often local country-bred stock. Imported brood-mares have included Argentines, Bretons from France, and Malapolski and stock from Poland. Characteristics The Indian Half-bred is wiry, hardy and well adapted to the climate and terrain of the country. Conformation is very variable; the horses generally stand about at the withers.

Etymology Sinorhizobium is a combination of Medieval Latin sino (which means \\"China\\"), Greek rhizo (which means \\"root\\"), and New Latin bios (which means \\"life\\"). Thus, the generic name means \\"a bacterium living in a root in China\\". The other name is from the New Latin term ensifer, which means \\"sword-bearing\\" or \\"sword-bearer\\". Proper name The name Ensifer was published in 1982 and the name Sinorhizobium was published in 1988. By the rules of the Bacteriological Code (1990 Revision) of the International Committee on Systematics of Prokaryotes (ICSP), the older name (Ensifer) has priority. In response to a request that the single extant species of Ensifer (Ensifer adhaerens) be moved to Sinorhizobium, a special ICSP subcommittee was formed to evaluate the request. It was ultimately ruled that Ensifer retained priority and that all Sinorhizobium species be transferred to the genus Ensifer. However, both terms continue to be used in published scientific literature, with Sinorhizobium being the more common. Deprecated species Two species have been described which have since been reclassified into existing species: Sinorhizobium morelense (now Ensifer adhaerens) and Sinorhizobium xinjiangense (now Sinorhizobium fredii‚Äîthough some dissent exists).

They are a hardy breed that is used for riding, packing, and light draft work. History The San Fratellano comes from San Fratello, in the Nebrodi mountains in the province of Messina in Sicily. The horses developed and were bred in a native habitat that resulted in a strong, powerful type known for their endurance. A Lombard princess, Adelaide del Vasto, married Roger I of Sicily, a Norman noble, in the 11th century AD. Sicily was ruled by Norman warlords at the time, and Princess Adelaide del Vasto brought to Sicily her retinue, including a number of knights and their horses. To this day the people of San Fratello speak a Lombard dialect, different from the Sicilian language of surrounding areas. The San Fratellano horse is said to have descended from the horses of the Lombard knights. The breed has received infusions of Anglo-Arab, Spanish Anglo-Arab, Salerno and Nonius blood, and has remained quite true to type. It resembles its fellow Italian breed, the Maremmano. Breeding stock is carefully selected for propagation, and most colts are trained young as pack horses. Breed characteristics The San Fratellano usually stands between , and weighs between They are always black or bay in color. They are muscular, well- built horses that are hardy and easy to care for. There are approximately 5,000 horses of this breed (including 1,800 broodmares), making it one of the most numerous indigenous breeds in Italy.

It derives from cross-breeding Thoroughbred horses with Sardinian horses carrying Arabian blood. History In 1874 The Ozieri Army Remount Station was established to supply mounts for the cavalry units of the Italian Army. To produce horses suitable for the cavalry, indigenous Sardinian mares were crossed with oriental-bred stallions such as the foundation sire Osmani√©, and, starting from 1883, also with French-bred Anglo- Arabian stallions. In 1915, captain Grattarola, director of the Ozieri Remount Station, continued the work by crossing the best 600 available mares with stallions of Purosangue Orientale breeding, using as his founding stallions Abbajan Sciarragh, Talata u Kamsin and Etnen u Kamsin, which had all been purchased directly from Bedouin desert tribes. Later on, Thoroughbred stallions started to be utilized on the mares of mixed Sardinian and oriental ancestry. One such Thoroughbred stallion was Rigogolo (son of Havresac II). A goal of a minimum of 25% Arabian blood was set. In 1967 the breed was officially named ‚ÄúAnglo-Arabo Sardo‚Äù (abbreviated in AAS). Lately the suffix \\"sardo\\" has been dropped and the breed is increasingly being promoted as an Anglo-Arabian horse. Related breeds There is also a smaller native horse called the Giara horse, which is thought to have developed from Numidian (North African-possibly Barb) stock brought to the island by the Carthaginians in pre-Roman times. It is these native horses that crossed first with Arabians and then Thoroughbreds, that provided the local foundation bloodstock that contributed to the creation of the Sardinian Anglo-Arab. The Government remount station in Ozieri is now crossing the Giara Horse with Arabians, Small AAS and even German riding Ponies in an effort to produce a pony ideally suited to equestrian sports, and is creating the \\"Giarab\\" pony breed. Many specimens of AAS are contributing to the foundation bloodstock of a new breed, named the \\"Sella Italiano\\" or Italian Saddle Horse. Uses Since the 1960s the AAS has proven itself in the sport of eventing and has also established itself as a racehorse and a steeplechaser. In 1990, Ostenda, an AAS horse won the Grand Prix des Pouliches in Tarbes, and the mare Vituliana repeated this feat in 1997. Vidoc, an AAS stallion, placed first in the Prix du Ministere in 1997. The majority of horses competing in the Palio di Siena belong to the Anglo Arabo Sardo breed. They replaced the Thoroughbred for racing in the Palio di Siena after several horses had fractured their legs in the tight turns of the Siena Square, so they were replaced by the shorter and sturdier breed whose legs can better withstand the stress of the race. This horse also plays an important role in the folk festivals of Sardinia's horse culture such as the Sartiglia di Oristano, The Cavalcata Sarda and the Ardia di Sedilo. Several specimens are used by mounted regiments of the Carabinieri police force, continuing the tradition of the breed as a cavalry horse.Sardinian horses used by Mounted Carabinieri Regiments Characteristics The Sardinian Anglo-Arab is characterized by solid feet and legs, a refined head with a straight profile and a fiery temperament with speed and stamina. In cavalry trials it was able to cover 100 kilometers per day for several days. Horses have a light (Dolichomorphic) build with long legs and neck. Colours include bay, chestnut or gray.

Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 18 July 2016 He is considered to be the primary and most original representative of Flemish Caravaggism. These Caravaggisti were part of an international movement of European artists who interpreted the work of Caravaggio and the followers of Caravaggio in a personal manner.Anna Orlando, Schede in Lights and Shadows. Caravaggism in Europe, catalogo della mostra, Cesare Lampronti Gallery, London, 2015, pp. 76‚Äì77 Life Rombouts was born in Antwerp as the son of Bartholomeus Rombouts, a wealthy tailor, and Barbara de Greve.De liggeren en andere historische archieven der Antwerpsche sint Lucasgilde van 1453‚Äì1615, edited and published by Ph.

He traveled to Rome in 1616 and stayed there until 1625.Theodoor Rombouts at the Kremer Collection He was recorded in the Roman parish of Sant‚ÄôAndrea delle Fratte, along with two other Flemish painters, Francesco Tornelli (Tournier?) and Robert d‚ÄôOrteil.Theodoor Rombouts, A Young Soldier at Adam Williams Fine Art It is possible that on a visit to Florence he met the Caravaggist Bartolomeo Manfredi and worked for Cosimo II de' Medici.Matthias Depoorter, Theodoor Rombouts at Baroque in the Southern Netherlands In 1622 he also travelled to Pisa. The denial of Saint Peter Upon his return to Antwerp in 1625 he became a master of the Guild of St. Luke. In 1627 he married Anna van Thielen, who was from a noble family and the sister of Jan Philip van Thielen. As his wife's family was not from Antwerp but from the Mechelen area, Rombouts had been required to obtain before the wedding a dispensation from the Antwerp City Council to consume the marriage outside Antwerp in order not to lose his Antwerp citizenship rights (in Dutch: 'poortersrechten'). The year after the wedding the couple had a daughter. His wife's brother Jan Philip van Thielen became his pupil in 1631 but would become a still life painter rather than a genre or history painter like Rombouts.Theodoor Rombouts at the Netherlands Institute for Art History The lute player In the period 1628‚Äì1630 Rombouts was deacon of the Guild in Antwerp. In 1635 Rombouts collaborated with other artists on the programme of the decorations of the Joyous Entry of Cardinal-infante Ferdinand in Antwerp, which was under the general direction of Rubens. He died in Antwerp not long after the completion of this decorative project. Rombouts' pupils were Nicolaas van Eyck, Jan Philip van Thielen and Paulus Robyns. Work =General= He painted mainly profane works as well as some altar pieces and civil commissions. His profane works depict merry companies, musicians, card players, as well as some of the other Caraveggesque themes such as the denial of St Peter and the five senses. He worked on commission and for the free market. Many of his commissions came from patrons based in the city of Ghent. His monumental genre pieces were painted on horizontal canvases. He also painted a few religious and mythological works on horizontal canvases, as is the case with Christ Driving the Money-changers from the Temple (Royal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp). =Early work= His initial works were in the idiom of his master Abraham Janssens who was one of the earliest Flemish artists to paint in a Caraveggio influenced style combined with strong Classicist tendencies. This is clear in the early composition Cephalus and Procris (Hermitage Museum, 1610s) which was painted before the artist left for Italy. In its three-dimensionality and use of Classical forms this composition is clearly indebted to Janssens.Theodoor Rombouts at the Prado Museum encyclopedia Christ driving the money-changers from the Temple The composition The two musicians (Spencer Museum of Art) likely dates from the artist's Italian period. The typically Italian costumes, the rather mannered poses, the vague indication of space and stereotypical rendering of heads, hands and drapery point to a style preceding that of the genre scenes he painted after 1625. =Genre painter= Rombouts was very successful after his return from Italy during the heyday of the Caravaggio movement in the Southern Netherlands from 1620 to 1640. His Caravaggesque conversation pieces are realistic and expressive. His work during this period is characterised by the use of chiaroscuro, the horizontal format and a pronounced model√© that sometimes looks sculptural and that points to the influence of his master Abraham Janssens. His use of diagonals in the composition and perspectival abbreviation, the illusive use of foreshortening and the avoidance of a conventional backdrop are prominent in a work such as the Card players (Royal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp). As in the work of his master Janssens, Rombouts' figures have an almost sculptural aspect. The Prado Museumalt= Rombouts was the first Flemish painter who, like Gerrit van Honthorst in the Dutch Republic, painted single male or female musicians. It is likely that he developed this type of painting under the direct influence of the works of the followers of Caravaggio whose works he had seen in Italy rather than through the intermediary of the Dutch Caravaggists. Rombouts' Lute player (Royal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp, 1620s) is a good example of the influence of Manfredi and Valentin de Boulogne on the Flemish Caravaggisti. Other Flemish painters such as Jacob Jordaens, Gonzales Coques, Jan Cossiers and Gillis Remeeus would later also adopt the type of the single musician.J. Richard J. Judson, 'Gerrit van Honthorst: A Discussion of his Position in Dutch Art', Springer, 1 Dec 2013, p. 68 Musical company with Bacchus The themes of the five senses and the seven deadly sins often appear in his work. Rombouts' The lute player (c. 1620, Philadelphia Museum of Art) is not solely a portrait of a musician but also alludes to the five senses through the objects included in the composition: hearing (the lute), taste (the tankard), smell (the pipe), sight (the musical scores), and touch (the knife).Theodoor Rombouts, The lute player at the Kimbell Art Museum The Card and backgammon players. Fight over cards (c. 1620‚Äì1630, National Gallery of Denmark) has uncontrolled anger as its principal subject. Moralising depictions of the deadly sin of wrath (anger) had been a tradition in Northern art for centuries.Theodoor Rombouts, Card and backgammon players. Fight over cards at the National Gallery of Denmark Rombouts regularly included portraits of himself and his wife in his genre paintings. An example is the Musical company with Bacchus (The Kremer Collection). Based on the two pendant portraits by Antony van Dyck of Rombouts and Rombouts' wife with their daughter in the Alte Pinakothek Munich, the couple in the middle of this composition is believed to represent Rombouts and his wife. That the two should be interpreted as a couple is made clear by the fact that the woman has put her hand on the man's arm. Couples making music or singing together was in 17th-century art and literature a popular reference to love. In addition, the tuning of the lute by the musician on the left is intended as a symbol of harmony in marriage. Music was further believed to operate as a cure for sorrow. In the composition described here the pleasures of music and love are enhanced by the wine brought in by Bacchus. Allegory of temperance Rombouts also collaborated with specialist painters in Antwerp for whom he typically painted the staffage in their compositions. Examples of such collaborations are the Kitchen (1630s, Hermitage Museum), a collaboration with still life painter Adriaen van Utrecht and The Holy Family (Royal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp), a collaboration with landscape painter Jan Wildens. =Later work= The popularity of the Caravaggio movement lost steam after 1630. Rombouts abandoned chiaroscuro effects for more tempered lighting, smoother transitions and a lighter palette. A good example of this is The Mystical Marriage of Saint Catherina (Saint James's Church, Antwerp). This late style approaches the later work of Rubens, with whom he collaborated in the realization of the decorations for the Joyous Entry of Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand in Antwerp in 1635. A late work directly influenced by Rubens is the Descent from the Cross (1636, St Bavo's Cathedral, Ghent), which directly cites Rubens' treatment of the same subject of roughly two decades earlier (Antwerp Cathedral).

It is also one of the newest having acquired its official status in 1997. History In wine-making contexts the name of Bages is often said to derive from an otherwise unnoted ancient Roman city of Bacassis located in the area. According to an unidentified mediaeval document from the former Benedictine monastery of Sant Benet, the Roman city was named in honour of Bacchus, the Roman god of wine. Production in the area was interrupted for almost a century after the outbreak of the phylloxera plague at the end of the 19th century. Geography The vineyards are mainly located in the valleys of the River Llobregat and its tributaries. Soils There are two different types of soil in two well-defined topographies: a central basin (Pla de Bages) with clay and marl soils at an altitude of 200 m above sea level; and a peripheral area (Alt Bages, \\"Upper Bages\\") where marl and lime bearing soils with a high carbonate content abound, at an altitude of 500 m above sea level. Climate The climate is Mediterranean with strong continental influences due to its inland location quite far from the sea. Humidity is lower, summers hotter and winters colder than in other wine- producing areas in Catalonia. The average annual temperature is 13¬∞C (max 35¬∞C in summer, -5¬∞C in winter) and there are considerable temperature variations between day and night as well. Average annual rainfall is between 500 mm and 600 mm. Authorised Grape Varieties The authorised grape varieties are: * Red: Mand√≥, Sumoll, Picapoll Negre, Garnatxa Negra, Ull de llebre, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, and Syrah * White: Macabeu / Viura, Parellada, Picapoll Blanc, Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Gew√ºrtztraminer, and Malvas√≠a The newer vineyards are planted on trellises (en espaldera) to allow mechanisation of the vineyard activities, at authorised planting densities of between 2,000 and 4,500 vines/ha depending on the terrain.

They were developed from horses bred in Italy before the founding of Rome, and the breed has continued to be developed to the present day through infusions of Arabian, Andalusian and Thoroughbred blood. Characteristics The Calabrese generally stands 16 to 16.2 hands high, and can be bay, brown, black, gray or chestnut. They have a refined head with a straight or slightly convex profile, a well-shaped, muscular neck, prominent withers, long, sloping shoulders, and a broad, deep chest. The back is straight and the croup muscular and sloping. The legs are muscular with strong tendons and well- formed hooves. The breed is used as a general purpose riding horse. They are generally active and energetic, while still manageable in temperament. History The Calabrese takes its name from the Calabria region of southern Italy, where it was developed. The breed has a long history, being a descendant of horses bred in Italy prior to the founding of Rome. However, the current characteristics started to evolve during the Bourbon period through the crossing of Arabian blood with Andalusian stock.Pickeral, Tamsin The Encyclopedia of Horses and Ponies. Parragon Plus, 2001. From the Middle Ages to the early 18th century, there was a decline in the breed as interest focused on the breeding of mules considered better able to cope with the terrain and workload. The mid-18th century to the mid-1880s saw a revival in the breed with the introductions of new Arabian and Andalusian blood. However, in 1874 the breed was again set back when many of the breeding studs were closed by a decree and much of the breeding stock split up. In the 20th century, the breeding of the Calabrese began again and there was the introduction of Thoroughbred, Arabian, Andalusian and Hackney blood. The Thoroughbred blood was used to improve performance and increase the breed's stature, while Arabian blood is still continuing to be added to ensure the breed keeps its refinement and uniquely oriental characteristics.Bongianni, Maurizio.

It takes its name from the town of Bardi, in the Apennines of Parma, and is principally associated with the surrounding area and the Valle del Ceno. The mountain environment and steep, rough terrain of the area have contributed to produce a robust, hardy breed, agile and sure-footed over difficult ground. Although some males and all females are under ,Bardigiano horse, in Italian the Bardigiano is always considered a horse in its home country. The stud book was established in 1977, and is held by the Associazione Provinciale Allevatori, the regional animal breeders' association, of Parma. The breed is widely distributed in Italy, with breeders in 26 Italian provinces; a recent study examined 3556 stud book entries for living horses. Due to these relatively large numbers, the breed is not considered to be at risk of extinction, but is classed as \\"vulnerable\\".Sabbioni A. and others (n.d.) Caratterizzazione demografica e variabilit√† genetica nel cavallo Bardigiano attraverso l'analisi dati genealogici, in Italian with English summary, accessed Mar 2011 The Bardigiano is used for activities that range from farm work to competitive driving and riding. They are also used extensively for pony trekking. In 1994, the breed standard was modified with the intention of increasing the suitability of the Bardigiano as a saddle horse while preserving its character. Breed Characteristics harness. The height range for the Bardigiano is fixed at 140‚Äì149 cm for males and 135‚Äì147 cm for females; horses outside these ranges are not admitted for registration. The only recognized coat colour is bay, and dark bay is preferred. Chestnuts and light bays are not recognized. Limited rabicano and white markings on the legs and face are allowed, but white facial markings with excessive lateral extension (commonly referred to as \\"bald- faced\\") are not. Physical characteristics of the breed include a small head with a straight or concave profile, low withers, straight back, deep girth, and overall a muscular appearance. Breed History The Bardigiano appears to have descended from the horses ridden by Belgian Gauls during their invasions into Italy during Roman times. This is the same ancestor from which the Haflinger appears to have developed. Over the centuries, the Bardigiano has adapted to the rough, mountainous habitat in the Northern Apennine region of Italy. As well as having some relationship to the Haflinger, the breed also bears characteristics similar to the English Exmoor and Dales ponies as well as the Asturcon. During World War I and World War II, Bardigiano mares were used to produce first-class mules, and in the process the number of purebred Bardigianos was significantly reduced. After World War II, in a move that is now widely considered a mistake, a diverse range of stallions from various breeds were introduced to reestablish the breed. However, this caused the breed to deteriorate and begin to lose its defining characteristics. Thus, in 1972, a committee was formed that has since successfully reestablished the Bardigiano breed.

They are used as a form of territorial marker. A range of animals are known to use them including steenbok,Cohen, Michael. 1976. The Steenbok: A neglected species. Custos (April 1976): 23‚Äì26. hyrax, and rhinoceros. Other animals are attracted to middens for a variety of purposes, including finding food and locating mates. Some species, such as the dung beetle genus Dicranocara of the Richtersveld in South western Africa spend their whole lifecycle in close association with dung middens. Dung middens are also used in the field of Paleobotany, which relies on the fact that each ecosystem is characterized by certain plants, which in turn act as a proxy for climate. Dung middens are useful as they often contain pollen which means fossilized dung middens can be used in Paleobotany to learn about past climates.  Examples of dung midden production in wild  = Hippopotamus = The common hippopotamus has been known to use dung middens as a social tool. The middens are created and maintained by bulls to mark territorial boundaries. To mark their scent upon a midden, the bull will approach the midden in reverse and simultaneously defecate and urinate on the mound, using its tail to disperse, or paddle, the excrement. This action is called dung showering and thought to assert dominance. The middens, usually several feet across, are constantly maintained during the bulls' travels in the night and day. = Rhinoceros = Rhinos in Namibia. Rhinos have been known to produce middens that can be 65 feet across. Dung-midden production is also observed in the White and Black rhinoceroses. The middens are shown to provide cues as to the age, sex, and reproductive health of the producer. Some of the middens can be 65 feet across. Dung beetles are frequently found in these middens and lay their eggs within the mounds. Their presence and activity in the middens also aid in pest and parasite control. Unlike the hippopotamus, rhino dung middens are shared between individuals that are not necessarily related. White rhino middens are distinguished by a black color and a primarily grass composition whereas black rhino middens tend to be brown and contain more twigs and branches, a product of the distinct diets. = Black Garden Ants = Midden formation in insects was first observed in Black Garden Ants, Lasius niger. The middens created by the ants are called \\"kitchen middens\\" and are composed of food scraps, ant corpses, and other detritus. A reason for the behavior has yet to be determined though it is thought to serve as a feeding ground for larvae. = Lemurs = The Dry Bush Weasel Lemur and Southern Gentle Lemur are known to construct middens. It is thought that these act primarily as communal latrines and communication tools, signaling dominance and other social cues, for families spread over large tracts of land. = Hyraxes = Hyrax, or Procavia, are small herbivorous mammals from across the African continent and normally inhabit in rock shelters, not typically wandering more than 500 meters from their shelter for fear of predation. These organisms use fixed dung middens for urinating and defecation, often under overhanging rocks in protected areas. Layers of dung are quickly hardened and sealed by Hyraceum, creating mainly horizontal middens. = Antelopes = Middens created by antelopes, as well as other herbivores, play an important role by providing nutrients to certain areas of land. It has been described that duiker and steenbok antelopes defecate in exposed sites, generally on sandy soil, thus enriching the nutrient-deficient areas, as well as depositing plant seed there.Lunt, N. (2011). \\"The role of small antelope in ecosystem functioning in the Matobo Hills, Zimbabwe\\". PhD thesis, Department of Zoology and Entomology, Rhodes University, Grahamstown. Mountain Gazelles Mountain gazelle in the Dubai Desert Conservation Area, UAE. It appears that middens have olfactory importance for mountain gazelles. Many gazelle species use middens (see also Animal latrine) for activities related to territory maintenance, advertisement and olfactory communication. Due to the investment required to maintain a midden, it is likely that middens would not be randomly placed throughout the environment, but rather would be distributed on different landmarks. Placing middens on conspicuous sites could attract the attention of hunters and provide the hunters with information about the location and activity of their prey. A group of researchers examined midden selection and use by mountain gazelles (Gazella gazelle) in central Saudi Arabia and hypothesized that if middens are used for territorial or communication purposes, then they would tend to be placed at the largest trees in the immediate area. Additionally, if mountain gazelle midden selection and use was predictable, then this would corroborate poachers' claims that gazelles are easy to hunt because of their predictable behavior. Ultimately it was found that midden size and the freshness of newly deposited feces could inform poachers about the gazelles' rates of midden use and potentially which middens are used more often. It was also found that middens are important communication centers for the mountain gazelles, and they are used by both sexes and by gazelles of various ages.  Ecological Implications  Dik-dik in Tarangire National Park, Tanzania. This species of ungulate utilizes dung middens as territory markers and have been implied to use middens in anti-parasite behavior via fecal avoidance. The widespread presence of dung midden use throughout the animal kingdom is coupled with a distinct variation in how dung middens are used from species to species. Dung midden use has been implicated in the context of both intraspecific markers of territory, sexual availability, and a part of anti- parasite behavior, but also as an essential part of the ecosystem, with interspecies interactions between the creators and users of dung midden piles. In some cases, it has been found that midden piles are the focal points of grazing lawns, not the other way around, as demonstrated by high frequency of grazing when old middens are present. = Intraspecific markers of territory = Territory or home-range maintenance is found in many species of animals as a way to divide resources, including food and mates. Often markers are employed to define such territories, and dung middens are one form of the markers employed. An example of dung midden use for territorial marking is found in the mountain gazelle, in which latrines/dung middens are found in the home-range cores and serve as a concentrated area to repel intruders while facilitating communication amongst the members of the female group. This method of dung midden use is distinct from other species such as the Thornson's gazelle and the G√ºnther's dik-dik, both of which use dung middens as peripheral territory markers instead. = Sexual availability = Olfactory communication through dung middens can also indicate sexual availability to conspecifics. In white rhino dung, a mixture of volatile organic compounds present signal the defecator's sex and age class, and depending on whether they are a male or female, also indicate the male territorial status or female oestrous state. Furthermore, dung middens act as a communication center for white rhino groups since the species practices communal defecation, allowing for these signals to easily reach potential mates. = Anti-parasite behavior = Blesbok in Malolotja Nature Reserve, Swaziland. Dung midden from this species is cycled through the local ecosystem through its interactions with harvester termites. Dung with high parasite loads are a significant source of fecal-oral transmitted parasites, which impose a high cost on individual fitness in wild ungulates. Quantifying studies of parasite loads in dung midden piles of free ranging dik-dik found that nematode concentrations were elevated in the vicinity of middens in comparison to single fecal-pellet groups or dung-free areas. Further feeding experiments found that the dik-diks tend to avoid the areas around dung middens when feeding, implying selective defecation and selective foraging where fecal avoidance could play a part in anti-parasite behavior in this species. = Mammalian-termite interactions = Termites are usually viewed as both herbivores and decomposers when present within an ecological community. In some cases, they are the link between mammalian consumers and the microbial decomposers that perform the final breaking down of organic matter within the local cycle of nutrients. A case of this relationship between termites and mammalian dung middens is observed in South Africa, between the endemic blesbok and harvester termites. The blesbok have been observed to deliberately place dung middens when they are in the vicinity of the harvester termite mounds. It has been suggested that this could be due to the fact that termite mounds are built on ground where the surrounding is cleared. This allows the blesboks greater ability to detect predators if foraging in the area, and termite presence in the vicinity could be an indicator of richer resources available from recycling of nutrients. Since decomposers such as termites increase the quality of the surrounding vegetation for foraging, this suggests that there is a positive evolutionary feedback within this interaction, with both participants in this interaction providing resources for the other.  Use in Paleobiology  = Climate Information = Bush Hyrax from Serengeti National Park, Tanzania. Fossilized dung middens from Hyrax species have contributed significant climate information for paleobiologists. Pollen that becomes fossilized in dung midden can provide information about the climate and environment during the time period when it was fossilized. This provides researchers with a better understanding of what historical environmental changes may have occurred leading up to the biodiversity and present day environment of various places. Fossilized hyrax (small herbivorous mammals resembling rodents but more closely associated with elephants and manatees) dung has been found in a rock shelter on the Brandberg Mountain in Namibia, has been found to possess fossilized pollen. Radiocarbon dating places it between 30,000 years ago to modern times, making it the first evidence of pollen from the Late Pleistocene in south-western Africa. The pollen is preserved by layers of dung that are piled upon each other and sealed by urine. The dung found from this time is that of the family Asteraceae, a family not known to be found in Namibia or deserts. This suggests that climate in this area may have been tropical during this time, but it is also hypothesized that the spores were spread either aromatically or aquatically from another location. In an earlier Brandberg Mountain sample from 17,000 years ago, Stoebe pollen was found in dung. There is also the presence of fern-spores indicating a moist climate during that time. This moisture would most likely be from melting and evaporating glaciers and not heavy rain. Sources of midden as old as 6,000 years ago can also be used to view the climate through the presence of certain pollen and the attributed rainfall necessary for those plants to be present and flowering. However, the changing presence of some plants can also be due to erratic conditions such as grazing and human interference by Nomadic people. Although, this is not thought to explain all of the aridity and variation of the area at certain times. The presence of certain flowering plants during the mid- Holocene that require more moisture leads to a conclusion of increased summer rainfall. This also accounts for the seasonal variability as many of plants found in the dung do not rely upon winter rain.  Example of dung midden use in paleobiology: Namib Desert  The Namib desert has an arid climate, making dung middens a valuable resource for researchers to study past climates. Much is unknown about the origins of the unique biodiversity in the Namib desert. It has an arid climate and granitic substrate, which does not favor the preservation of organic material that would typically help provide insight into the history of the biodiversity.Scott, L., and J.C. Vogel. \\"Evidence for environmental conditions during the last 20000 years in Southern Africa from 13C in fossil hyrax dung.\\" Global and Planetary Change 26.1-3 (2000): 207-15. Web. http://www.paleodiversitas.org/PDF/112.pdf Common artifacts typically used to study environmental conditions such as lake or swamp deposits, caves, river systems, or dune-fields do not exist. Thus it has been difficult to understand the history of the Namib desert. Through the use of dung middens found in various parts of the desert, researchers are able to reconstruct the paleoenvironmental conditions. Specifically, fossilized hyrax dung in shallow cave shelters contains fossilized pollen and dust which contains information on the vegetation that was consumed by the hyrax. Pollen data can provide information on the vegetation during different time periods, and using this data the changes in moisture levels in desert areas such as the desert northwest of Namibia can be determined. While the pollen and dust in the dung provides information on the types of vegetation that previously existed, it is also important to use radiocarbon dating for information on the era that the dung is from. In a town in South Africa, researchers found conflicting data about the time period the dung midden they were studying was from. The initial researchers failed to consider the impact of local radiocarbon concentrations that were higher than usual due to the testing of nuclear arms. Through pollen analysis, radiocarbon dating, and considering the history of radiocarbon levels in the atmosphere, dung middens are able to provide useful information about the historical environment of dry and arid places such as the Namib desert.

History : See 98th Operations Group for additional history prior to 1947 Emblem of the 98th Bombardment Wing (Medium) =Organization and Korean War= During the early years of the Cold War, the 98th Bombardment Wing, Very Heavy (BW) was formed 24 October 1947 as part of the Air Force's experimental wing base (Hobson Plan) reorganization and assigned to Strategic Air Command. The 98th BW was discontinued on 12 July 1948, and replaced by the 98th BW, Medium the same day when the test was deemed successful and the organization made permanent. From November 1947 to July 1948 and July 1948 to July 1954, the wing headquarters was often manned as a \\"paper\\" unit with most of its components attached to other establishments for long periods. The wing's tactical group was operational, but under control of other organizations from November 1947 to April 1950 and again from August 1950 through March 1951.Ravenstein, Combat Wings, pp. 138‚Äì141 98th Bomb Wing B-29 over Korea On 1 April 1951, wing headquarters deployed to Japan to assume control over combat operations of the group's three tactical squadrons,Ironically, at this time it was the group that became a paper unit while the rest of the wing remained behind in Washington. In 1952, the combat squadrons were joined by three maintenance squadrons. Wing combat missions in Korea included interdiction of enemy communications and support of United Nations ground forces. Its last combat mission flown 25 July 1953 and it dropped propaganda leaflets on the day of truce two days later. During the Korean War, the squadrons of the 98th flew more than 5,000 sorties and dropped more than 40,000 tons of bombs (actual total unavailable). They earned a Distinguished Unit Citation, a Korean Presidential Unit Citation and 10 battle streamers. The 98th was credited with the destruction of 5 MiG 15 Jet Fighters and one propeller driven fighter. The 98th recorded 19 Boeing B-29 Superfortress losses from August 1950 to July 1954. = Cold War = B-47s on the Ramp at Lincoln AFB The wing remained at Yokota Air Base, Japan in combat- ready status for another year. Meanwhile, wing components not deployed in Japan moved to newly reopened Lincoln AFB, Nebraska to supervise construction in preparation for movement there of the deployed wing components. The wing disposed of its B-29s at the \\"boneyard\\" at Davis-Monthan AFB, Arizona. In July 1954, wing components concentrated at the wing's new base,This was the first time since 1947 that all wing components were under the wing's control at the same base but in October, the 98th gave up its host responsibilities at Lincoln to the 818th Air Division.The Lincoln AFB Online Museum - History (retrieved 14 Jan 2013) Air refueling operations were already underway by then. The wing's squadrons began receiving new Boeing B-47E Stratojet swept- wing medium bombers in January 1955, capable of flying at high subsonic speeds and primarily designed for penetrating the airspace of the Soviet Union. At this point the wing began an intensive training program to convert to combat ready status as soon as possible. This was achieved in April 1955. During next decade, the wing participated in Strategic Air Command's worldwide bombardment training and air refueling commitments. The wing deployed to RAF Lakenheath, England from 11 November 1955 to 29 January 1956. Starting in 1960, the wing maintained B-47s on ground alert 24 hours a day. From January 1964 to April 1965, the wing also controlled an SM-65 Atlas intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) squadron and was redesignated as the 98th Strategic Aerospace Wing. In the early 1960s, the B-47 was considered to be reaching obsolescence, and was being phased out of SAC's strategic arsenal. Beginning in 1964, the wing began sending its aircraft to Davis-Monthan AFB. Lincoln AFB was closed and the wing inactivated in 1966. = European Mission = KC-135 on takeoff Emblem of the 98th Strategic Wing The wing was inactivated on 25 June 1966 at Lincoln AFB, but activated the same day at Torrejon Air Base, Spain replacing the 3970th Strategic Wing (SW). The 3970th SW had been established on 1 July 1957 at Torrejon as the 3970th Air Base Group to support B-47 and KC-135 elements from SAC CONUS-based units deployed to Europe as part of REFLEX deployments and provide a refueling mission to USAFE tactical fighters. Until 1 April 1966, when SAC transferred Torrejon to USAFE, the 3970th also acted as the host base organization for all USAF units at Torrejon. The group was assigned seven support squadrons and a hospital to carry out its mission. It was redesignated the 3970th Combat Support Group on 1 June 1959 and upgraded to wing status on 1 February 1964. In 1966, SAC received authority from Headquarters USAF to discontinue the 3970th SW (a MAJCON wing) and activate an AFCON wing which could continue the lineage and history of a combat wing. On 5 June 1966, the 3970th SW was replaced by the 98th Strategic Wing, which assumed the personnel, equipment, and mission of the 3970th Strategic Wing, For the next decade, the 98th had no tactical aircraft components assigned to it, but rather used attached Boeing KC-135 Stratotankers and crews furnished by other SAC wings to provide air refueling support for the operational, alert exercise commitment of SAC, Tactical Air Command, United States Air Forces Europe and NATO. These aircraft were deployed on temporary duty as the Spanish Tanker Task Force. The wing's operational area included the Eastern Atlantic Ocean, most of Europe, North Africa and the Middle East. The Wing maintained a detachment at RAF Upper Heyford (relocated to RAF Mildenhall in April 1970) supporting RC-135 Reconnaissance Aircraft, and supporting KC-135 Tankers deployed from the Spanish Tanker Task Force. In October 1976, the 306th Strategic Wing, based at Ramstein AB, West Germany assumed this support task and the 98th phased down at Torrejon and was inactivated 31 December 1976. = Post Cold War = 98th Range Wing Emblem In October 2001, the wing was redesignated the 98th Range Wing and began operating the range facilities of the Air Warfare Center from Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada. It replaced the 99th Range Group and 99th Range Squadron of the host unit at Nellis, the 99th Air Base Wing. Its mission is to provide a flexible and realistic \\"battle space\\" to support training, testing, and tactics development, for which it controls the airspace over 12,000 square nautical miles, 7,000 of which are shared with civilian aircraft. The NTTR supports Department of Defense (DOD) advanced composite force training, tactics development, and electronic combat testing as well as DOD and Department of Energy testing, research, and development. It acts as the single point of contact for range customers. In June 2011, the wing was redesignated Nevada Test and Training Range and its operational groups were replaced by directorates.

It is used mainly as a riding horse, and is known for its hardiness and stamina. Characteristics The Kazakh horse averages for stallions and mares average . They weigh between . The breed is criticized for a short stride and a jolting trot. However, they are also very hardy and able to cover long distances. The breed consists of two subtypes, the Adaev and the Dzhab or Jabe. The Dzhabe developed in the southern districts of Aktubinsk. They have a heavy head, thick, short neck, and deep chest. They have a straight back, strong legs and a well-muscled croup. They are usually bay, dark bay, chestnut or gray. The Adaevs are more refined with lighter heads, longer necks, and well-defined withers. Due to the primitive conditions in which they live, this strain is more susceptible to developing narrow chests and light bone structure. History Horses in the region of Kazakhstan date to the 5th century B.C. Early influences on what today is the Kazakh horse include the Akhal-Teke, Arabian, Karabair, and Mongolian horse. Beginning in the 20th century, the breed had additional infusions of blood from the Russian Don, Orlov Trotter and the Thoroughbred. The Kazakh today resembles a more elegant version of the Mongolian horse. The breed is still bred by once-nomadic Kazakh tribesmen, although cross-breeding has somewhat diluted the traditional bloodlines.\\"The Sports of Presidents and the 'Sport of Kings'.

It was closed in 1959 and now forms part of the Dales Countryside Museum. Since 2015, the museum has rented the building to a business operating a bike shop and later, also a cafe. History The station was opened in October 1878 by the Midland Railway (MR) as the terminus of their branch line from Hawes Junction. The MR branch made an end-on junction there with the North Eastern Railway (NER) line from Northallerton via Bedale which had been opened as far as Leyburn by 1856 and then extended onwards to Hawes in the summer of 1878. Although the station belonged to the Midland, the NER (and later the LNER) operated most of the passenger services from there ‚Äî the MR section being worked as an extension of the service to/from Northallerton. The only exception to this was a single daily return service between Hawes and Hellifield that for much of its life was known by the somewhat unusual nickname of Bonnyface.Houghton & Foster; p. 51 The NER section of the line lost its passenger service in April 1954, but the station retained a nominal service of one train each way from Hawes Junction (by then renamed Garsdale) until final closure to passengers on 16 March 1959. Goods traffic from the Leyburn direction continued until complete closure in April 1964,Body; p. 144 after which the track was lifted and the buildings left to fall into disrepair. However, after many years of disuse, the site was purchased by the Yorkshire Dales National Park Authority and converted into a museum and tourist information centre in the early 1990s, a role it continues to fulfil to this day. As part of this scheme, the station buildings and platforms were refurbished, a short length of track relaid. A preserved industrial tank locomotive, cosmetically painted in British Railways colours, together with a pair of ex-BR Mark 1 coaches, were installed as a static exhibit (see accompanying photo). Although isolated from the national rail network for over fifty-five years, the Wensleydale Railway hopes to one day eventually rebuild, re-instate and re-open the currently abandoned and derelict section of line between Redmire and Garsdale (thus would involve restoring the station to its former glory and active use). However, the train with three carriages which currently resides in the platform would have to be removed and placed in a newly-constructed siding, because the project involves re-instating the entire station to its former use.

She served during the Second World War, participating in operations in the North Sea and off the Norwegian coast, before taking part in some of the Arctic convoys. She spent a further ten years in Royal Navy service after the end of the war, before being sold to the Israeli Navy, which operated her as INS Eilat. She saw action during the Suez Crisis in 1956, attacking Egyptian ships and was still active by the outbreak of the Six-Day War in 1967. She was sunk several months after the conflict by missiles launched from several small Egyptian missile boats; this made her the first vessel to be sunk by a missile boat in wartime. It was an important milestone in naval surface warfare, which aroused considerable interest around the world in the development of small manoeuvrable missile boats. Second World War Zealous was one of four British destroyers of the Home Fleet that rescued 525 Norwegians, who had been hiding from German patrols in caves on the snow- covered mountains of S√∏r√∏ya island, Norway for three months. The rescue, on 15 February 1945, which also included , , and involved the destroyers on a daring race behind enemy lines. The Norwegians were safely evacuated via a returning Murmansk convoy (RA 64) to the British port of Gourock. Zealous made two trips from the UK to Russia as part of the Arctic Convoys taking supplies around Norway to Kola. Under the guidance of Commander R.F. Jessel RN DSO she ran the gauntlet of German U-Boats and aircraft. On 5 April 1945 she was involved in an attack on a convoy entering the J√∏ssingfjord on the coast of Norway. One merchant ship was sunk and two were damaged. Service as Eilat INS Eilat From October 1945 until August 1946 Zealous served in the 4th Destroyer Flotilla as part of the Home Fleet. From 1947 until 1950 she was held in reserve at Devonport. Between 1950 and 1951 she underwent a refit at Cardiff. Between 1953 and 1954 she was held in reserve at Penarth. In 1955 the UK sold Zealous to Israel, which commissioned her into the Israeli Navy as INS Eilat (after the Israeli southern coastal city of Eilat, replacing the earlier INS Eilat) in July 1956. On the morning of 31 October, in the midst of the Suez Crisis, the Egyptian destroyer Ibrahim el Awal ( an ex-British Hunt class destroyer) shelled Haifa harbour. A counter-attack by the French destroyer Kersaint and by the Israeli Yaffo and Eilat forced the Egyptian destroyer to steam back towards Port Said. It was then also attacked by a pair of IDF/AF Ouragans and a Dakota. The crew of the badly damaged vessel finally capitulated, and the Israelis towed the ship to Haifa; it later became the Haifa in the Israeli Navy.Suez Crisis On a patrol during the night of 11‚Äì12 July 1967, Eilat and two Israeli torpedo-boats came across two Egyptian torpedo-boats off the Rumani coast. They immediately engaged the vessels and sank both. =Sinking= Eilat was sunk on 21 October 1967 in Mediterranean international waters off Port Said in the Sinai, hit by three Soviet-made Styx missiles launched by Egyptian missile boats. An Egyptian positioned within the harbour at Port Said fired two missiles at the Israeli destroyer. Eilats radar did not reveal any suspicious activity or movements because the Egyptians launched the missiles from within the port. Eilat's captain ordered evasive action when the missiles were detected, but the first missile hit the ship just above the waterline at 5:32 p.m. Two minutes later the second missile struck, causing additional casualties. While Eilat began to list heavily, the crew tended to the wounded and engaged in rescue and repair operations while waiting for additional ships of the Israeli Navy to come to their rescue. But around an hour later another Egyptian Komar-class missile boat from Port Said harbour fired two more Styx missiles at Eilat. The third missile hit Eilat amidships, causing more damage and further fires, while the fourth went astray and crashed in the water nearby. Eilat sank about two minutes later. Out of a crew of 199, 47 were killed and more than a hundred were wounded.Rabinovich, 1998. p. 11. =Aftermath of the sinking= The sinking just months after its defeat in the Six-Day War caused brief jubilation in the Arab World and crowds gathered to cheer the two missile boats upon their return to Port Said. In Israel, angry crowds surrounded Chief of Staff Yitzhak Rabin and newspaper editorials demanded vengeance. Sixty-seven hours after the attack Israel retaliated by shelling Port Suez with heavy mortars. Two of the site's three oil refineries were destroyed with the smallest one left standing. The refineries produced all of Egypt's cooking and heating gas, and 80% of its oil. Other areas of the city were hit. Israel ignored or pleaded \\"technical difficulties\\" to UN requests for a ceasefire. The Soviet Union sent seven warships on a \\"courtesy call\\" to Egyptian ports to dissuade Israel from further attacks. Torpedo tubes from INS Eilat Monument to the Fallen of INS Eilat, Haifa. Sculptor: Igael Tumarkin The sinking of Eilat by surface-to- surface missiles inaugurated a new era in the development of naval weapons and the formulation of naval strategy throughout the world. Though not highly publicized at the time, the sinking had a considerable impact on the Israeli Navy. Israel started to develop plans for German-influenced ship designs better suited to missile combat, principally small and efficient boats armed with missiles, able to patrol Israeli shores and undertake offshore operations at high speed, while at the same time able to evade enemy tracking and missiles. The resulting focus on new, more agile, missile-armed boats (see Sa'ar 2-class missile boat) would reap major benefits for the Israeli navy six years later during the Yom Kippur War. A set of torpedo tubes removed from Eilat before her sinking are preserved at the Clandestine Immigration and Naval Museum, Haifa, and a Monument to the Fallen of INS Eilat was established just outside the Museum, the work of sculptor Igael Tumarkin.

It is presumed that she and her siblings were born at Turnberry Castle in Carrick. Life After his army's defeat at the Battle of Methven on 19 June 1306, Robert Bruce headed west to the mountains. He sent his second wife, Elizabeth, his daughter Marjorie, his sisters Christina and Mary Bruce, as well as Isabella MacDuff, Countess of Buchan to Kildrummy Castle in the north, with his brother Nigel (known as Neil) in an attempt to protect them.\\"Elizabeth de Burgh and Marjorie Bruce\\", Foghlam Alba When Kildrummy was besieged, the women were forced to flee. After Kildrummy Castle was betrayed and captured, Neil de Bruce was taken to Berwick to be hanged, drawn, and beheaded. The women escorted by John of Strathbogie, 9th Earl of Atholl made it as far as the sanctuary of St. Duthac at Tain in Easter Ross. There, they were captured by a Balliol supporter, Earl William of Ross, who handed them over to Edward I's men. Strathbogie for daring to aid them was executed, his body burned and his head affixed on London Bridge. Christina was sent into solitary confinement at a Gilbertine nunnery at Sixhills in Lincolnshire, while her sister Mary and Bruce's supporter Isabella MacDuff were imprisoned in cages. Her sister in law Elizabeth de Burgh was imprisoned at various locations and her niece Marjorie, only 10 years old, was imprisoned at Watton Abbey.Scott, Ronald McNair, Robert the Bruce, p. 87 Christina spent eight years as an English prisoner, and returned to Scotland in October 1314 as part of the ransom for the Humphrey de Bohun, Earl of Hereford, who was taken prisoner after the Battle of Bannockburn. Christina's first marriage was prior to her capture, in 1301 she married Sir Christopher Seton, who was born in 1278. The marriage ended in 1306 when he was hanged, drawn and quartered by the English. In July 1326, at Cambuskenneth Abbey, In about 1326 when the Papal dispensation for their marriage is dated, Christina was married for a second time to Sir Andrew Murray, the posthumous child (b. 1298) of Sir Andrew Murray, a joint victor of the Battle of Stirling Bridge along with William Wallace. Sir Andrew died in 1338. Sir Andrew Murray had 2 sons: Sir John Murray (d.1351), and Sir Thomas Murray (d.1361), however, Christina is believed to have been their step-mother. In 1326 at the time of her marriage to Andrew, Christina would have been well past 50 years old, too old to bear children. Christina is sometimes thought to have also married Gartnait, son of Donald, Earl of Mar (died 1305). She is never described as a Countess of Mar, however, or even described as \\"of Mar\\". Moreover, there is no evidence of any familial relationship with Gartnait's son and successor, Donald II. In 1335, during the Second War of Scottish Independence, Christina commanded the garrison of Kildrummy Castle and successfully held out against pro-Balliol forces led by David of Strathbogie, prior to their defeat by her husband, Sir Andrew Murray, at the Battle of Culblean.A History of the County of Renfrew from the Earliest Times By William Musham Metcalfe p.69-70  References  Sources * Penman, Michael Robert the Bruce: King of the Scots * Traquair, Peter Freedom's Sword * * Category:1270s births Category:1350s deaths Christina Bruce Category:People of the Wars of Scottish Independence Category:13th-century Scottish people Category:14th-century Scottish people Category:Women in medieval European warfare Category:Women in 14th-century warfare Category:13th-century Scottish women Category:14th-century Scottish women ","title":"Christina Bruce"},{"id":"11785378","text":"A Nation of Bears is the second full-length CD release from the Daniel Bennett Group.

Military career to 1871 Louis Briere de l'Isle was born on 4 June 1827 in Martinique. In 1847 he graduated from Saint-Cyr and was made Sous lieutenant in the Troupes de marine, promoted to lieutenant in 1852 and captain in 1856. In the French colonial campaign in French Indochina, he was served as adjudant major du r√©giment de marine (1859‚Äì1860). Stationed in Cochinchina from 1861 to 1866.

Areas in pink are annexed to the French Empire, while much of the surrounding territory are French \\"protectorates\\". After the war, Bri√®re de l'Isle was named Governor of S√©n√©gal from 1876 to 1881. He took an important role in the French conquest of Senegal. Kanya-Forstner describes him as \\"an authoritarian ruler who angered French commercial interests and turned the colony into a quasi-military dictatorship\\".Kanya-Forstner, p. 57. Finding the colony in dire financial straits, he increased taxes on imported cloth from other countries, which went some way to placating the large French commercial houses while alienating local interests in Saint-Louis and Dakar. Militarily, the Senegal colony had recently faced both uprisings in the Wolof states which now make up the coastal heart of Senegal, and powerful states in the interior. The Minister of the Navy issued orders to Governor Bri√®re de l'Isle that no new territory was to be annexed. Despite this he began a series of expansions through protectorates and direct military control, unprecedented since the highpoint of expansion under the governorship of Louis Faidherbe (1854‚Äì1865). Bri√®re de l'Isle oversaw the conquest of French territory in West Africa which would be formalised at the Berlin conference of 1884, beginning the so-called \\"Scramble for Africa\\".Kanya-Forstner, pp. 55-70; Pakenham pp. 112, 165-68. =Expansion into the Middle Niger= In April 1873 Bri√®re de l'Isle, had sent Paul Soleillet to S√©gou (now central Mali) to open negotiations with the ruler Ahmadu Tall, beginning French expansion into the Middle Niger River valley. In March 1880, he again sent envoys to S√©gou, this time led by the future governor Joseph Gallieni to establish regular trade.\\"The purpose of these diplomatic negotiations was to prepare for the ultimate battles of conquest, not avoid them.\\" Colvin (1981) p. 136. In the process, Gallieni constructed the French fort at Bafoulab√©. Soleillet had advocated in his reports for what was to become the Dakar-Niger Railway, linking Senegal to the middle Niger at S√©gou. Bri√®re de l'Isle was quickly won over, and found an ally in the new Minister of the Navy (to whom colonial officials reported), Admiral Jean Bernard Jaur√©guiberry, appointed February 1879. While Jaur√©guiberry failed to win sufficient government funding, and Gallieni's failure to build roads to Bafoulab√© shook government resolve, the process of eastward expansion of direct territorial control had begun. Charles de Freycinet, Minister of Public Works supported the proposed railway, and in 1880, Jaur√©guiberry issued a decree that all work on the railway was to be carried out by the Troupes de Marine.Kanya-Forstner, pp. 67-71 Bri√®re de l'Isle was committed to expanding French control over the middle Niger River valley, but unlike many of his predecessors the French governments of the late 1870s were more willing to sanction (or accept) direct conquest of territory. Ironically the merchant houses based in Saint-Louis were in this period still hesitant about direct control of the hinterlands, preferring to work through their own trade networks and the series of French military trading posts. In this way as well, Bri√®re de l'Isle was representative of the next stage in French colonialism.Klein (1998) pp. 59, 61, 78, 145. See also: C. W. Newbury and A. S. Kanya-Forstner. French Policy and the Origins of the Scramble for West Africa. The Journal of African History, Vol. 10, No. 2 (1969), pp. 253-276. =Final pacification of Senegal= In 1876 and 1877, Bri√®re de l'Isle saw to it that the last remaining Wolof leader who could offer a threat to the French, the already isolated Lat Dior, was blocked from any attempt to retake his lost territory, and consolidated French control over northwest Senegal.Mamadou Diouf (1990) pp. 255-262. When Dior and his Cayor kingdom again rose in 1879, the French crushed them for the final time. This enabled Bri√®re de l'Isle's government to go ahead with what had been Faidherbe's grand project: the construction of the Dakar-Saint-Louis railway through the rich groundnut cultivating regions of central Senegal. This provided transport, security, and access to a rich export crop that would be channeled through French merchant ports.Colvin (1981), p.136. In October 1877 Bri√®re de l'Isle's began a campaign east and south along the Senegal River aimed at Abdul Bubakar's state in the northern Fouta Djallon highlands. Ignoring direct orders from Paris, he sent a force to attack Bubakar, forcing him to submit to a French protectorate over the provinces of Toro, Lao and Irlab√©. =French Guinea= To the south (in what is today Guinea), he began a series of offensives in Rivi√®res du Sud occupying positions near Benty in 1879 and seizing the islands of Kakoutlaye and Matakong. This, with the expansion in Fouta Djallon, laid the basis for the formal creation of Rivi√®res du Sud colony in 1882. =Conflict with the Toucouleur Empire= In 1878 he sent another French force against the Kaarta Toucouleur vassal state along the north bank of the Senegal River. Again blocked by the colonial minister in Paris, he argued that they were a threat to the Senegalese kingdom of Futa Tooro (then a French client state) with which the British were poised to interfere. The Ministry, under Jaur√©guiberry, gave in and on 7 July 1878, a French force destroyed the Tokolor fort at Saboucir√©, killing their leader, Almany Niamody. This portion of the Kaarta vassal state was then incorporated into the Khasso Wolof protectorate kingdom.Kanya-Forstner (1969), pp. 57-59 This marked the beginning of the conquest of the Toucouleur Empire by the French. While the Siege of Medina Fort in 1857 had helped persuade the empire's founder El Hadj Umar Tall to turn his attentions east of the Senegal River valley, the French had had little contact with the conquest state since then. This allowed first Faidherbe and then Bri√®re de l'Isle a free hand in what is now Senegal. Bri√®re de l'Isle's tenure marked not only the consolidation of French control of Senegal, but the next push to the east. This same commitment to military expansion led to Bri√®re de l'Isle dismissal when the political winds in Paris changed. Admiral Georges Charles Clou√© was named Minister of the Navy in 1881, and the Governor was warned that expansion of the rail line to the Niger River was a low priority, to be pressed by civilian (business) interests only, removing the Marine involvement in its construction. Clou√© ordered the governor to cease military operations pushing east of Kita. Within weeks Bri√®re de l'Isle ordered his military protege Lieutenant Colonel Gustave Borgnis-Desbordes to launch a punitive expedition to the Niger and seize the small town at Bamako. Bri√®re de l'Isle was recalled on 11 March 1881 in response. By the end of 1881 Senegal had its first civilian governor, Marie Auguste Deville de Peri√®re.Kanya-Forstner (1969), p.86. Pakenham, pp. 168, 177-78, 182. =Foundation for the conquest of French Soudan= While it fell to Borgnis-Desbordes, Joseph Gallieni and Louis Archinard to lead the conquest of the middle Niger region, Bri√®re de l'Isle began the advance, and oversaw the creation of the military territory of \\"Upper Senegal\\" (Haut-S√©n√©gal) region on 27 February 1880. This created the institutional conditions, just as Bri√®re de l'Isle's flouting of government restrictions stoked the martial culture, for independent action and imperial expansion by officers in the field. One historian has written that the creation of Haut-S√©n√©gal: > ...marks the real beginning of the phase of French expansion in Africa > christened \\"military imperialism\\" by Kanya-Forstner. For the next twenty > years marine commanders, not government ministers, would determine the pace > and extent of French expansion along the road to Timbuktu.Vandervort (1998) > p. 117. Giving its military commanders sufficient cover to act unilaterally (if unlawfully), this territory was quickly expanded through conquest to the east, and renamed French Sudan in 1890. Tonkin General Bri√®re de l'Isle and his staff on the eve of the L·∫°ng S∆°n Campaign. General Fran√ßois de N√©grier (with hand on chest) and Lieutenant-Colonel Paul-Gustave Herbinger (clasping cane in both hands) are in the front row. Promoted brigadier (g√©n√©ral de brigade) in 1881, Bri√®re de l'Isle was given command of the 1st Brigade of the Tonkin Expeditionary Corps in February 1884, during the French expedition to Tonkin (now northern Vietnam). In March 1884 he drove the Chinese from the Trung Son heights and routed the right wing of the Guangxi Army in the B·∫Øc Ninh campaign. In recognition of his services at B·∫Øc Ninh, he was appointed a Grand Officier de la L√©gion d'honneur in April. In April 1884 he outflanked the defences of H∆∞ng H√≥a with the 1st Brigade while General Fran√ßois de N√©grier's 2nd Brigade fixed them frontally, forcing Liu Yongfu to withdraw the Black Flag Army from the town before his men were cut off. Bri√®re de l'Isle's flank march at H∆∞ng H√≥a enabled the French to occupy the most heavily fortified Black Flag stronghold in Tonkin without losing a man.Thomazi, 183‚Äì9 In September 1884, shortly after the outbreak of the Sino-French War (August 1884 to April 1885), he replaced General Charles-Th√©odore Millot as general-in- chief of the Tonkin Expeditionary Corps. In October 1884 he defeated a major Chinese invasion of the Tonkin Delta in the Kep Campaign. In January 1885 he was promoted divisional general (g√©n√©ral de division). In February 1885 he commanded both brigades of the Tonkin Expeditionary Corps in the L·∫°ng S∆°n Campaign, defeating China's Guangxi Army and capturing the strategically important border town of L·∫°ng S∆°n. This campaign, which required months of patient preparation, was perhaps the greatest military achievement of his career. Immediately after the capture of L·∫°ng S∆°n he returned to Hanoi with Lieutenant-Colonel Laurent Giovanninelli's 1st Brigade to relieve the Siege of Tuy√™n Quang, leaving General Fran√ßois de N√©grier's 2nd Brigade at L·∫°ng S∆°n. After defeating Liu Yongfu's Black Flag Army at the Battle of H√≤a M·ªôc (2 March 1885), Bri√®re de l'Isle entered the beleaguered French post in triumph on 3 March. These battlefield successes underscored the failure of concurrent diplomatic attempts to resolve the conflict between France and China, and evoked a heartfelt tribute from the French premier Jules Ferry: 'It seems that the only negotiator China will respect is General Bri√®re de l'Isle.'Thomazi, 234‚Äì48 Bri√®re de l'Isle's record of substantial military achievement was marred at the end of March 1885 by the controversial Retreat from L·∫°ng S∆°n. The retreat, which threw away the gains of the February L·∫°ng S∆°n Campaign, was ordered by Lieutenant-Colonel Paul Gustave Herbinger, the acting commander of the 2nd Brigade, and came less than a week after General de N√©grier's defeat at the Battle of Bang Bo (24 March 1885). Bri√®re de l'Isle was in Hanoi at the time, and was planning to shift his headquarters to H∆∞ng H√≥a, to supervise a planned offensive against the Yunnan Army around Tuy√™n Quang. Without waiting to sift the misleading information contained in Herbinger's alarmist cables from L·∫°ng S∆°n, Bri√®re de l'Isle fired off a pessimistic telegram on the evening of 28 March to the French government, warning that the Tonkin Expeditionary Corps faced disaster unless it was immediately reinforced. This cable, immediately dubbed the 'L·∫°ng S∆°n telegram', brought down Jules Ferry's government on 30 March 1885, ruined Ferry's political career, and dealt a severe blow to domestic support for French colonial expansion (see Tonkin Affair). It also cast a shadow over Bri√®re de l'Isle's professional reputation. Although he was to obtain further professional advancement before his retirement, he knew that he would in future be remembered not as the French commander who had captured L·∫°ng S∆°n and relieved Tuy√™n Quang but as the man who had lost his head and sent the notorious telegram that had brought down Ferry's administration.Thomazi, 256‚Äì61 In May 1885, in consequence of its expansion into a two-division army corps, Bri√®re de l'Isle was replaced in command of the Tonkin Expeditionary Corps by General Henri Roussel de Courcy. He was offered command of the 1st Division of the expanded expeditionary corps, and accepted only on condition that General Fran√ßois de N√©grier was given command of the 2nd Division. The army ministry granted this request, and Bri√®re de l'Isle served under de Courcy's command for several months. De Courcy was an arrogant and obtuse commander, unwilling to listen to advice from his more experienced juniors, and relations between the two men soon plummeted. Bri√®re de l'Isle disagreed with de Courcy's unimaginative pacification strategy in Tonkin and his failure to take effective quarantine measures to deal with a cholera outbreak in August 1885. In October 1885, with Annam and Tonkin in open insurrection against French rule and the Tonkin Expeditionary Corps decimated by cholera, he decided that he had had enough. Unable to stomach working for de Courcy any longer, he left Tonkin and returned to France.Thomazi, 266‚Äì84 Final years Bri√®re de l'Isle was appointed Adjutant Inspector General of Marine Infantry from 1888 to 1891, then Inspector General from 1892 to 1893. He died on 19 June 1896, Saint- Leu‚ÄìTaverny, Seine-et-Oise Department (now in Val-d'Oise Department), France.

One of many. A German Fate from the Year 1929\\") was the last of an unofficial trilogy of films produced by the Nazis shortly after coming to power in January 1933, celebrating their Kampfzeit ‚Äì the history of their period in opposition, struggling to gain power. The film is a partially fictionalized biography of the Nazi martyr Horst Wessel. Development Originally, the film, based on Hanns Heinz Ewers's novelistic biography, was named Horst Wessel. Goebbels temporarily banned it, eventually allowing its release with alterations and with the main character's name changed to the fictional \\"Hans Westmar\\".D. Welch, Propaganda and the German Cinema, pp. 61‚Äì71. One reason may have been to avoid \\"de- mystifying\\" Wessel.Robert Edwin Hertzstein, The War That Hitler Won p 262 Part of the problem was that authentic depiction of Stormtroopers, including picking fights with Communists, did not fit the more reasonable tone the Nazis adopted while in power, and would undermine Volksgemeinschaft; the fictionalized Westmar, unlike Wessel, does not alienate his family.Claudia Koonz, The Nazi Conscience, p. 85 It was, however, among the first films to depict dying for Hitler as a glorious death for Germany, resulting in his spirit inspiring his comrades.Erwin Leiser, Nazi Cinema p24 His decision to go to the streets is presented as fighting \\"the real battle.\\"Richard Overy, The Dictators: Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Russia, p462 Along with S.A Mann Brand and Hitlerjunge Quex, Hans Westmar was the last of the trilogy of films released in 1933, which were designed to present an idealized account of the Nazis' heroic struggle to come to power in Germany. Plot The film concentrates on the conflict with the Communist Party of Germany in Berlin in the late 1920s. When Westmar arrives in Berlin the communists are popular, holding large parades through Berlin singing The Internationale. When he looks into the cultural life of Weimar Berlin, he is horrified at the \\"internationalism\\" and cultural promiscuity, which includes black jazz music and Jewish nightclub singers. This scene dissolves into images of the German fighting men of World War I and shots of the cemeteries of the German dead. Westmar decides to help organize the local Nazi party and becomes, through the course of the plot, responsible for their electoral victories, which encourages the Communists to kill him. Depiction of communism While communism as such is depicted as the foe, the communists fall into three categories.Erwin Leiser, Nazi Cinema p35 While the party boss shamelessly transmits the party line from Moscow, and the short Jewish official incites violence and then flees, and are directly responsible for the murder, one communist is presented as an idealist fighting for the proletarian. In the last scene, on seeing a Nazi torchlight procession on the eve of the Nazi seizure of power, he is moved to salute the new Germany; Hans Westmar's example has inspired him.Erwin Leiser, Nazi Cinema p35-6 Originally banned by Goebbels The movie was originally called Horst Wessel. Ein deutsches Schicksal and was banned immediately after it was first shown in October 1933, since Horst Wessel was shown in a prostitution- as well as Christian milieu. According to the Nazi Film Review Office the film \\"does neither do justice to Horst Wessel's personality nor to the national socialist movement as the leader of the state.\\"Alfred Bauer: Deutscher Spielfilm Almanach 1929‚Äì1950. New edition 1976, p. 190. Original in German: \\"weder der Gestalt Horst Wessels noch der nat. soz. Bewegung als der Tr√§gerin des Staates gerecht\\" Goebbels justified the ban as follows: :\\"As national socialists we do not particularly value to watch our SA marching on stage or screen. Her sphere are the streets. Should however somebody try to solve national socialist problems in the realm of art, he must understand that also in this case the art does not come from ambition but ability. Even an ostentatious display of a national socialist attitude is no substitute for an absence of true art. The national socialist government has never demanded the production of SA-movies. On the contrary: we see a danger in this excess. [‚Ä¶] In no way does national socialism justify artistic failure. The greater the idea that shall find a form the greater the aesthetic demands have to be.\\"Erwin Leiser: ‚ÄûDeutschland, erwache!‚Äú Propaganda im Film des Dritten Reiches. Rowohlt, Reinbek bei Hamburg 1968, p. 30. Original in German: Wir Nationalsozialisten legen an sich keinen gesteigerten Wert darauf, da√ü unsere SA √ºber die B√ºhne oder √ºber die Leinwand marschiert. Ihr Gebiet ist die Stra√üe. Wenn aber jemand an die L√∂sung nationalsozialistischer Probleme auf k√ºnstlerischem Gebiet herangeht, dann mu√ü er sich dar√ºber klar sein, da√ü auch in diesem Falle Kunst nicht von Wollen, sondern von K√∂nnen herkommt.

Early life Herman Bodson was born on 21 December 1912, the son of Alida and Fernand Bodson who was an architect. He gained a Doctor of Science in physical chemistry and was close to acquiring a master's degree in Mineralogy. When the Second World War broke out, Bodson was mobilized into the Belgian army Medical service. Resistance After the Belgian surrender in 1940, Bodson became involved in resistance work. He initially joined the resistance group known as OMBR, but later formed a new cell in the Ardennes. As an explosives expert, Bodson was involved in numerous sabotage missions, including an attack on a German railway convoy in which 600 German soldiers were killed. He was also involved in sheltering allied airmen which had been shot down and is credited with saving the lives of 17 allied pilots. During the Battle of the Bulge, he was trapped in the besieged town of Bastogne where he assisted US forces as a medic. For his service in the resistance he was awarded numerous Belgian medals, including the Commemorative and the Resistance Medals as well as the British King's Medal for Courage in the Cause of Freedom and American Medal of Freedom. Post-war career After the war, Bodson worked at the Union Chimique Belge in Brussels. He married in June 1948. In 1951, Bodson and his family moved to Elisabethville in the Belgian Congo.

Oxford English Dictionary Second Edition on CD-ROM (v. 4.0) ¬© Oxford University Press 2009 Several methods can be used to shore up a trench. Hydraulic shoring is the use of hydraulic pistons that can be pumped outward until they press up against the trench walls. They are typically combined with steel plate or a special heavy plywood called Finform. Another method is called beam and plate, in which steel I-beams are driven into the ground and steel plates are slid in amongst them. A similar method that uses wood planks is called soldier boarding. Hydraulics tend to be faster and easier; the other methods tend to be used for longer term applications or larger excavations. Shoring should not be confused with shielding by means of trench shields. Shoring is designed to prevent collapse, whilst shielding is only designed to protect workers should collapse occur.

It was first published in The Blue Review in June 1913,Katherine Mansfield, Selected Stories, Oxford World's Classics, explanatory notes and was republished in Something Childish and Other Stories (1924). Plot summary Millie is alone in her house, as her husband and the other men have gone to find Harrison, an English handyman who has supposedly killed Mr Williamson. After looking at her wedding pictures in Mount Cook, she hears a noise coming from the garden and finds a wounded man lying there. She offers him food and realises it is Harrison; she decides to feed him anyway when she sees how beleaguered he comes across. Millie sees that he is just a boy and that awakes a maternal instinct in her. She vows that he will go free. The men later come home and have settled down from the night when they hear a noise outside. It is Harrison attempting to escape from his hiding place by riding Sid's horse. Immediately, they decide to chase him on foot. Millie's final, shrieked reaction to the pursuit is ambiguous; it is not clear whether she is gleeful at their futile attempt to catch Harrison, or whether she has had a change of heart and, in the heat of the moment, is spurring the hunters on.

Armee). Lasting from 4 December 1943 to 4 January 1944, the campaign occurred primarily in the vicinity of the Moro River in eastern Italy. The campaign was designed as part of an offensive launched by General Sir Harold Alexander's Allied 15th Army Group, with the intention of breaching the German Army's Winter Line defensive system and advancing to Pescara‚Äîand eventually Rome. Beginning on 4 December, four infantry divisions‚Äîone British, one Canadian, one Indian and one New Zealand (which included an armoured brigade)‚Äîand two armoured brigades (one British and one Canadian) of V Corps and XIII Corps attacked heavily defended German positions along the Moro River, achieving several exploitable bridgeheads by 8 December. Throughout the next week, nearly continuous combat operations by both sides‚Äîdesigned to keep one another pinned down‚Äîcreated stagnated defensive positions near Orsogna and a narrow pit known as \\"The Gully\\". After being held at the Gully for 10 days, the Canadians succeeded in outflanking German defences, and forcing a German withdrawal to the Ortona‚ÄìOrsogna Line. On 20 December, the line was attacked by both corps. By 26 December, strong German defences had stalled Canadian forces during the Battle of Ortona and British and New Zealand forces in Orsogna. Although both Ortona and Villa Grande were captured by the end of December, general exhaustion among the Allied forces prevented the capture of Orsogna and an advance to Pescara. When harsh winter weather set in, it became clear to the Allied commanders that no further progress would be made and General Alexander called off the offensive. Background Map of the campaign In late 1943, the 15th Army Group under General Sir Harold Alexander were fighting their way northward in Italy against determined German opposition, commanded by Generalfeldmarschall Albert Kesselring, whose forces had prepared a succession of defensive lines.Bercuson, p. 172 East of the Apennine Mountain spine was the British Eighth Army, under General Sir Bernard Montgomery. In October, the Eighth Army had crossed the Biferno river and pushed the German defenders from the Volturno-Viktor Line defences. Delayed by logistical problems, they were not able to attack the next line of defences (the Barbara Line) behind the Trigno river until 2 November. However, by 9 November forward elements of the Eighth Army were in contact with the forward defences of the German Winter Line, which had been set on the high ground north of the Sangro River. The main attack across the Sangro by V Corps (Lieutenant-General Charles Allfrey), comprising the British 78th Infantry Division (Major-General Vyvyan Evelegh) and 8th Indian Infantry Division (Major-General Dudley Russell) with supporting and diversionary attacks further inland by the 2nd New Zealand Division (Lieutenant-General Sir Bernard Freyberg) and XIII Corps (Lieutenant-General Miles Dempsey) was delayed by bad weather until late November. After several days of hard fighting, the Germans withdrew to the defences they had prepared on the high ground to the north of the Moro river.Hoyt (2007), pp. 112‚Äì114 =Offensive strategy and order of battle= The Moro River runs from the central mountain spine of Italy to the Adriatic coast south of Ortona. The German defences on the Moro were a centerpiece of the Winter Line, which guarded the eastern side of the Apennines along Route 5. Montgomery hoped to punch through the Winter Line, capture Ortona and Pescara and advance to Rome. The British 78th Infantry Division, which had been spearheading V Corps since the Volturno Line actions and had sustained over 7,000 casualties in less than six months,Hingston (1946), p. 23 was relieved by the fresh 1st Canadian Infantry Division (Major-General Christopher Vokes), ready to renew the offensive on 5 December 1943.Hoyt (2007), p. 115 The 78th Infantry Division was sent into the mountains on the relatively quiet left wing of the army, joining the British 5th Infantry Division (Major-General Gerard Bucknall) under XIII Corps. Montgomery's plan was for the 1st Canadian Division to attack across the Moro in the coastal lowlands to take Ortona first and then Pescara. Inland, in the jagged hills above the headwaters of the Moro, the relatively fresh 2nd New Zealand Division would attack toward Orsogna, while between these two the 8th Indian Infantry Division would hold the centre of the front in a relatively static role. Facing the British V Corps was the 1st Parachute Division (1. Fallschirmj√§gerdivision) under Brigadier General (Generalmajor) Richard Heidrich on the coast, to their right stood the 90th Panzergrenadier Division (90. Panzergrenadierdivision) under Major General Carl-Hans Lungershausen succeeded by Colonel (Oberst) Ernst-G√ºnther Baade on 20 December, and further inland of them was the 26th Panzer Division (26. Panzerdivision) under Brigadier General Smilo Freiherr von L√ºttwitz with their right flank on Orsogna. Further inland, facing the British XIII Corps, was the 65th Infantry Division (65. Infantriedivision) under Brigadier General Hellmuth Pfeifer supported by elements of 1st Parachute and 5th Mountain Division (5. Gebirgsdivision) under Brigadier General Julius Ringel.Phillips (1957), p. 107 Together, these units formed Traugott Herr‚Ä≤s LXXVI Panzer Corps, the part of Joachim Lemelsen's 10th Army responsible for the front line to the east of the Apennines. Campaign =Canadian division across the Moro= On 6 December 1943, Canadian forces began a series of large-scale assaults on major crossing points along the Moro River with the objective of securing a large bridgehead along the defensive line.Zuehlke (2001), p. 158 Three primary points of attack were chosen: Villa Rogatti, along the western edge of the Canadian sector; San Leonardo, south of Ortona; and San Donato, a small town near the Italian coast. Five primary infantry battalions were selected to assault these positions with the objective of crossing the Moro River. The offensives were scheduled to start on the morning of 6 December.Bercuson, p. 173 =Villa Rogatti= The task of taking Villa Rogatti, the westernmost crossing point, was given to Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry (PPCLI). Having conducted reconnaissance on their objective during the night of 5 December 1943,Zuehlke (1999), p. 76 an attack plan was devised by the battalion's commander‚ÄîLieutenant-Colonel Cameron Bethel Ware‚Äîdetailing the objectives of all four rifle companies. Once the objectives had been secured by the early morning of 6 December, Anglo-Canadian reinforcements were to be moved into Villa Rogatti, with the intention of repulsing the expected potentially strong German counterattacks.Zuehlke (1999), p. 77 Elements of three German regiments‚Äîthe 200th and 361st Panzergrenadier, and 26th Panzer‚Äîmaintained strong defences within the town.Zuehlke (1999), p. 48 At 00:00 on 5 December, two companies of the PPCLI crossed the Moro River, moving towards Villa Rogatti.Zuehlke (1999), p. 78 Within an hour, vicious fighting had erupted throughout the town as the two companies of Canadian infantry struggled to break the German defensive lines.Zuehlke (1999), p. 79 As B Company broke through the German defences, A Company attacked to the northeast, continuing to engage 200th Panzergrenadier Regiment (200. Panzergrenadier_Regiment) near Villa Rogatti. Although two Canadian infantry companies now occupied Villa Rogatti, German Panzergrenadier forces still maintained substantial defences on the outskirts of the town. However, C Company continued to advance steadily along the eastern side of the town, encountering significant resistance from the 361st Panzergrenadier Regiment (361. Panzergrenadier-Regiment).Zuehlke (1999), p. 80 After approximately an hour of fighting by C and D Companies, Villa Rogatti had been occupied by Canadian forces shortly before dawn.Zuehlke (1999), pp. 84‚Äì85 By mid-morning, German counterattacks on PPCLI positions in the town had begun, involving tanks from the 7th Company of the 26th Panzer Regiment (26. Panzer-Regiment),Zuehlke (1999), p. 89 field guns and substantial infantry forces. Throughout the afternoon two infantry companies of the PPCLI fought off several attacks by German forces, eventually managing to push them back to the vineyards on the northern edge of the town. While the PPCLI had taken 68 casualties, German casualties were estimated at 120.Zuehlke (1999), p. 91 However, three strong German formation surrounded the Canadian positions at Villa Rogatti, rendering further exploitation of the bridgehead unlikely. Col. Ware was advised to be ready to withdraw across the Moro River, should German forces counterattack. In order to allow the Canadian Division a greater concentration of force, on the night of 7/8 December, the Indian 21st Infantry Brigade from the Indian 8th Infantry Division amalgamated the western flank of the 1st Canadian Division into their own lines.Hingston (1946), p. 24 As a result of the withdrawal, Canadian efforts would focus on achieving a bridgehead at San Leonardo. =San Leonardo= The Canadian attack on San Leonardo by the Seaforth Highlanders of Canada began late on 5 December 1943 with A Company establishing a bridgehead across the Moro, taking heavy casualties. In the early morning of 6 December, A Company was withdrawn and two additional Seaforth companies resumed the offensive. As PPCLI secured and held their bridgehead over the Moro River, the Seaforth Highlanders were struggling to enter San Leonardo.Zuehlke (1999), p. 92 By 07:15, a single objective had been taken, with Canadian units pinned down by well-coordinated defensive fire from several companies of the 361st Regiment. Simultaneously, small arms fire prevented C Company from moving up the road from the Moro to San Leonardo, while D Company remained on the southern banks of the Moro throughout the early morning. In the afternoon, having failed to capture San Leonardo, the Hastings and Prince Edward Regiment sent two rifle companies to the aid of the Seaforth Highlanders, as Seaforth B Company attacked positions west of San Leonardo ‚Äî inflicting 129 casualties on German forces in the area.Zuehlke (1999), p. 94 However, the attack on San Leonardo by three Seaforth companies stalled rapidly when the 26th Panzer Regiment's armoured companies reinforced the sector.Zuehlke (1999), p. 96 As a result, Forin was ordered to prepare for a withdrawal from the San Leonardo bridgehead. =San Donato= While attempts were made to cross the Moro at San Leonardo and Villa Rogatti, The Hastings and Prince Edward Regiment launched an attack on the Moro River defences at the small coastal hamlet of San Donato at 13:40 on 6 December.Zuehlke (1999), pp. 98‚Äì99Zuehlke (2001), p. 159 However, the single rifle company making the attack achieved little territorial gain and Lieutenant-Colonel Kennedy‚Äîcommander of the Hastings & Prince Edward Regiment‚Äîordered a withdrawal at 15:40. Throughout 6 December, strong German coastal defences would prevent further advancement, despite the incorporation of tanks and artillery into the assault. By nightfall, the German defenders still possessed control of San Donato, with the Hastings and Prince Edward Regiment withdrawing to the southern bank of the Moro River. =Taking the Moro= Soldiers of the Seaforth Highlanders of Canada searching German prisoners near the Moro River, 8 December 1943 On 8 December 1943, Major General Vokes devised a new plan for taking the Moro River. While the 48th Highlanders of Canada and Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry resumed the assault on San Leonardo from the southwest side of the town, the Royal Canadian Regiment (RCR) would break out of the bridgehead created by the Hastings and Prince Edward Regiment, then move southwest towards San Leonardo to link up with the 48th and PPCLI. The operation was scheduled to start on the afternoon of 8 December.Bercuson, p. 174 The attack began with a massive artillery barrage which pounded German positions continuously for two hours.Zuehlke (1999), pp. 122‚Äì123 At 16:00, the Saskatoon Light Infantry support battalion joined in, hitting German positions with bursts of machine gun fire. The moment the heavy bombardment lifted, the 48th Highlanders and the RCR both initiated their attacks. D Company of the 48th Highlanders was able to quickly cross the Moro, taking minimal casualties. However, B Company was subjected to heavy fire from German mortars and artillery positions.Copp (November 2006) Eventually, however, both companies managed to establish strong positions on the western ridge overlooking San Leonardo. During the night of 8/9 December, units of the Royal Canadian Engineers (RCE) constructed a bridge over the Moro, to allow armour and equipment to move into San Leonardo the following day. As the 48th Highlanders secured their positions west of San Leonardo, the Royal Canadian Regiment was involved in intense fighting southwest of San Donato. Two companies had advanced against strong and well prepared German defences of the 200th Panzergrenadier Regiment.Zuehlke (1999), p. 130 A Company was quickly tied down by German mortar fire, while B Company flanked German positions to the north of San Donato. By nightfall, all four companies held tenuous positions in the thick of German defences. On the night of 8/9 December, the RCR was subjected to counterattacks by the 200th Panzergrenadier Regiment which were repulsed with the support of continuous Canadian artillery shelling. By the morning of 9 December, the RCE had completed the bridge across the Moro River, enabling the tanks of the 14th Armoured Regiment (The Calgary Regiment) to transport two companies of Seaforth Highlanders across the river into San Leonardo. By mid morning, San Leonardo had been cleared of German defenders, although strong positions still existed outside of the town. Within an hour, the Calgarys' tanks had broken through German positions near Sterlen Castle and two companies had linked up with the 48th Highlanders and Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry within San Leonardo, finally establishing firm Canadian positions across the Moro River. Near the end of 9 December, German forces of the 90th Panzergrenadier Division fell back to their second defensive line: a formidable obstacle known as \\"The Gully\\". =Attacks on Orsogna= While Canadian crossed the Moro River, the New Zealand Division launched a two brigade attack, Operation Torso, against Orsogna at 14:30 on 7 December.Philips (1957), pp107-109 The division had the British 2nd Independent Parachute Brigade under their command, anchoring their left flankPhillips (1957), p. 105 and were supported by heavy concentrations of artillery and air support.Phillips (1957), p. 109 Surprise was achieved as Traugott Herr, the commander of LXXVI Panzer Corps, had been persuaded that the New Zealanders would not be in a position to launch a major attack until 8 December.Phillips (1957), p. 110 Initially, the New Zealand attack progressed well,Phillips (1957), p. 111 but the German defenders regained their composure and the attack lost momentum against heavily fortified defensive positions. By 21:00, the NZ 24th Infantry Battalion had fought its way in slow house to house fighting to the centre of the town, but were pinned down with no prospect of further progress without significant armoured support.Phillips (1957), p. 114 However, a combination of concealed minefields and well dug in German armour made the task of the Allied tanks impossible.Phillips (1957), p. 116 In the early hours of 8 December, the New Zealand commander‚ÄîBernard Freyberg‚Äîordered a withdrawal from the town with a view to renewing the attack after further softening up from artillery and bombers.Phillips (1957), p. 115 =Indian Division across the Moro ‚Äì the \\"impossible\\" bridge= With both the Canadian and New Zealand Divisions finding progress difficult, it was decided to bring the Indian 21st Infantry Brigade into the attack with orders to seize Caldari. With no river crossing available, the Indian engineers rushed to build a bridge across the Moro which was completed on 9 December and allowed infantry and supporting armour to cross and expand the bridgehead on the far bank. The bridge was named the \\"Impossible Bridge\\" because the local geography required for it to be built backwards from the enemy bank of the river.Hingston (1946), p. 24 =The Gully= Canadian Sherman driven off the road by German mortar fire, 10 December 1943 Following the loss of San Leonardo and the Moro River, the 90th Panzergrenadier Division withdrew to a primary defensive line north of San Leonardo. The line centred around a natural ravine known as \\"The Gully\\", with an average depth of .Zuehlke (1999), p. 166 General Vokes' initial plan to take the position (as well as achieve a foothold on the roads toward Ortona) consisted of a frontal assault by the 2nd Canadian Infantry Brigade, which would seize Vino Ridge, capture The Gully and gain positions on the Ortona to Orsogna road.Berton, p. 437 However, German defences were adequately prepared, including gun-pits, bunkers and shelters. On 10 December, three Canadian battalions made their first attempt to cross The Gully. Although they succeeded in capturing Vino Ridge, directly south of The Gully, attempts to neutralise German positions in the ravine were unsuccessful.Copp (January 2007) On 11 December, the three battalions made another attempt, with the Loyal Edmonton Regiment suffering heavy casualties in their attempts to take German positions in the sector. Although a badly mauled A Company was able to gain a foothold on the reverse slope, newly arrived German units forced the remaining men to withdraw.Zuehlke (1999), p. 177 On 12 December 1943, General Vokes sent the three battalions of the 3rd Canadian Infantry Brigade against German defences in The Gully.Berton, p. 438 The assault started poorly, when Canadian artillery plans were captured by soldiers of the 90th Panzergrenadier Division's 200th Regiment.Zuehlke (1999), p. 186 When The West Nova Scotia Regiment attacked The Gully, they were subject to counterattacks by the 200th Panzergrenadier Regiment approximately 10:30. By 14:00, the regiment had called off its attacks and had taken heavy casualties. To the west, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry fared little better, with C Company taking heavy casualties in their assault. Attempts were again made on 13 December, by two battalions of the 3rd Canadian Infantry Brigade, and the attacks were driven back by tenacious German resistance. On the evening of 13 December, the heavily depleted 90th Panzergrenadier Division were relieved from their positions in The Gully by units of the 1st Parachute Division.Berton, pp. 438‚Äì439 =Casa Berardi= By 14 December, Vokes had devised a new assault plan for taking The Gully. A small force from the Royal 22e R√©giment would move to Casa Berardi, a small set of farmhouses west of The Gully, before outflanking German positions with infantry and armour, thereby forcing the 1st Parachute Division to withdraw. The attack was to begin at dawn, with two companies of the Royal 22e R√©giment attacking Casa Berardi with artillery support. By 07:50, both companies had control of the lateral highway leading to Casa Berardi. C Company‚Äîunder Captain Paul Triquet‚Äîpushed on toward Casa Berardi with support from the Ontario Regiment, while D Company found itself involved in firefights southwest of Casa Berardi. At 08:30, C Company began their assault toward the manor house in Casa Berardi, some away. Strong German defences caused heavy casualties to the attackers; only 21 men and five tanks made it to within of the objective. Despite the arrival of several Panzer IVs, Triquet's remaining forces captured the manor house at 14:30. However, only 14 men of C Company remained fit to continue fighting.Zuehlke (1999), p. 210 For his efforts to capture Casa Berardi, Triquet was awarded the Victoria Cross.Bercuson, p. 175 =Eighth Army reorganises to intensify the attack= With the Indian Division committed, Montgomery decided to raise the stakes further by bringing the British 5th Infantry Division from the relatively tranquil XIII Corps front in the high mountains on the left wing of the 8th Army and insert them between the New Zealand and Indian Divisions. This would allow the Indian division to narrow and concentrate their attack and give Montgomery four divisions to continue the attack between Orsogna and the sea. By 12 December, the British 17th Infantry Brigade‚Äîthe first of 5th Division's brigades‚Äîwas in place and under the New Zealand division's command. Once 5th Division headquarters and its other brigades had arrived, these two left hand divisions were to be organised under the command of XIII Corps, commanded by Lieutenant-General Miles Dempsey.Phillips (1957), p. 119 To the left of the Canadian division, the Indian 21st Brigade had by 13 December established a solid bridgehead around the \\"Impossible Bridge\\". That night, a second 8th Indian Division brigade‚Äîthe 17th Indian Infantry Brigade‚Äîpassed through and attacked towards Caldari. The 1st Battalion Royal Fusiliers stormed the village in a wild night's fighting while the 1st Battalion 5th Gurkha Rifles seized Point 198 nearby, holding it against determined counterattacks, including from tanks in the afternoon of 14 December. That evening, 1st Battalion 12th Frontier Force Regiment attacked on the left of the Gurkhas and established positions on the lateral road between Ortona and Orsogna running parallel to the Moro some north of the \\"Impossible Bridge\\". On the evening of 15 December, the 1st/5th Battalion Essex Regiment from the Indian Division's 19th Indian Infantry Brigade, which had been held in reserve, was committed on the left flank of the Frontier Force Regiment to advance in the direction of Crecchio and overran a number of German positions. By the end of 16 December, further attacks from the 15th Punjab Regiments 3rd Battalion had secured positions on the lateral road, ensuring that the 8th Indian Division was firmly embedded in the main German defences.Hingston (1946), p. 26 Meanwhile, at 01:00 on 15 December, the New Zealand Division‚Äîelecting not to make a further frontal assault on Orsogna‚Äîlaunched their 5th Brigade in Operation Florence, a new flanking attack to the right of the village.Phillips (1957), p. 121 By that afternoon, 5th Brigade was well established on the Orsogna to Ortona lateral road and had driven a shallow salient into the German forward defensive line. Although they had exhausted nearly all their reserves,Phillips (1957), p. 127 divisional headquarters was optimistic for the prospects for the next day, given the heavy casualties they had inflicted that day.Phillips (1957), p. 128 However, the Germans launched a counterattack at 03:15 on 16 December, throwing in men from the 6th Parachute Regiment, sent by Herr to the 26th Panzer Division to relieve the exhausted 9th Panzergrenadier Regiment. These troops had arrived late that evening after a long journey. Supported by tanks, they attacked the right-hand New Zealand positions held by the 21st NZ Battalion, but were held off and had retired by daylight. Meanwhile, even before the German counterattack had been repelled, the 20th Regiment had attacked toward Orsogna with two squadrons of Sherman tanks. Under intense artillery and anti-tank fire, the tanks and infantry became separated and the tanks became a target rather than a threat.Phillips (1957), p. 131 Operation Florence had come to an end. While the German line had been pushed back and they had sustained casualties they could ill afford, they still firmly held Orsogna. Furthermore, the New Zealand Division was, for the time being, fought out and needed a period of consolidation and reorganisation.Phillips (1957), 9. 133 By 16 December, the British 5th Division had completed its move into the line between the New Zealand and the Indian divisions. There followed a period of hostile patrolling and skirmishing on the XIII Corps front. The main burden of the fighting was therefore assumed by V Corps as the Canadians pushed for Ortona with the Indian Division on their left flank attacking toward Villa Grande and Tollo.Phillips (1957), pp. 133‚Äì139 =Taking The Gully= In preparation for what he hoped would be the final attack on The Gully, Vokes shifted the 2nd Canadian Infantry Brigade to occupy positions formerly belonging to the 1st Brigade. Vokes planned for an attack by The Carleton and York Regiment to be the last of the frontal assaults against The Gully. Should this attack fail, the 1st Brigade's Seaforth Highlanders and the Royal Canadian Regiment would move through Casa Berardi and outflank German defences, forcing a withdrawal from The Gully. At 07:30 on 15 December, two companies of the Carleton and York Regiment attacked. After little more than an hour of fighting, however, the Canadians were forced to call the attack off. In the afternoon, the two heavily depleted companies of the Royal 22e R√©giment fought off a large German counterattack on Casa Berardi, with the Royal Canadian Horse Artillery firing 5,398 rounds in support of Canadian forces.Zuehlke (1999), p. 219 On 18 December, Vokes planned what would be the largest assault on The Gully during the campaign. Beginning at 08:00, Canadian artillery would bombard a front, to a depth of . Every five minutes, the barrage would move forward, continuing to pound German defences in the bombardment area. Less than 100 m behind this barrage, the 48th Highlanders would advance across the Ortona-Orsogna Lateral Road. At the same time, the 8th Indian Division would attack northward toward Crecchio, preventing German reinforcements from reaching The Gully. When the 48th Highlanders reached the Cider Crossroads, the Royal Canadian Regiment would move north, overrunning Cider itself, then advance up the Ortona-Orsogna road. Both battalions would be supported by tanks of The Three Rivers Regiment. At first, the attack went extremely well. However, when the artillery shifted their barrage, the German defences quickly recovered and their machine gun fire devastated the advancing forces. In C Company of the Royal Canadian Regiment, every platoon commander was killed or wounded. The attack was quickly abandoned. On 20 December, Canadian forces tried again and The Royal Canadian Regiment attacked Cider Crossroads at noon. This time, Vokes was determined that the operation would be successful, with armoured forces of the Three Rivers Regiment moving to the start lines well before 07:00.Zuehlke (1999), p. 235 Due to shortages of fuel and poor weather, H-Hour was postponed until 14:15. When H-Hour came, a powerful creeping barrage supported two companies of the Royal Canadian Regiment eastward. By evening, B Company controlled the Cider Crossroads, having met virtually no resistance in their advance to the objective. However, German forces had already evacuated The Gully, falling back to prepare for a strong defence of Ortona, with elements of the powerful 1st Parachute Division firmly entrenched in the town.Zuehlke (2001), p. 160 =Villa Grande= On 23 December Montgomery was promoted to command the 21st Army Group in Operation Overlord, the Allied invasion of Normandy. Command of the Eighth Army passed to Lieutenant General Sir Oliver Leese who kept up pressure on the whole front. The 19th Indian Brigade was ordered to attack Villa Grande and exploit any gains as far as the Arielli river which ran from the mountains through Tollo to the Adriatic.Hingston (1946), p. 27 The attack went in at 05:30 on 22 December but failed in desperate fighting. The 1/5th Battalion, Essex Regiment renewed their attack the following morning with more success. After a counterattack by German paratroops had been repulsed at midday, the Essex advanced to mop up the remainder of the village. However, deadly small scale house-to-house battles continued throughout the rest of 23 December and for the next two days as the determined parachute soldiers clung on. To the south of Villa Grande, the 3rd/15th Punjabis had taken Vezzano on 23 December and a continuous brigade line had been established.Hingston (1946), p. 28 On 25 December, reinforcements in the form of 3rd Battalion, 8th Punjab Regiment were brought forward and after a softening up barrage were launched at the east side of Villa Grande. With four battalions now involved (the 5th Battalion, Royal West Kents had by now been tasked on the south east side of the village) supported by tanks, Villa Grande was finally cleared by the end of 26 December.Hingston (1946), pp. 29‚Äì30 The troops of the 8th Indian Division entered the village to find a shambles. One correspondent described the scene \\"as though a giant had trodden on a child's box of blocks\\".Hingston (1946), p. 30 =XIII Corps attacks Orsogna= On 23 December, Lieutenant- General Dempsey's XIII Corps launched a new attack to push back the German line from Orsogna. In the afternoon, the British 5th Infantry Division attacked on the right wing of the Corps front toward the Arielli stream. Their objective was to secure the flank of the 2nd New Zealand Division, which was in turn to attack northwest and west from the salient in order to roll up the Orsogna defences on the Fontegrande plateau from the north.Phillips (1957), p. 140 After the British 5th Infantry Division had pushed from Poggiofiorito they took the town of Arielli and their objectives.Doherty pp 184-68 The 5th New Zealand Infantry Brigade attacked at 04:00 on 24 December. Despite intensive artillery support (272 guns on a front), the tired and understrength New Zealand battalions struggled to make progress. By the afternoon, it had become clear to the New Zealand commander‚ÄîBernard Freyberg‚Äîthat the stubborn defences of the 26th Panzer Division would not be broached. He is reported to have remarked, \\"It is not a question of further advance, it is a question of holding on to what we have got\\".Phillips (1957), p. 145 The XIII Corps front was effectively deadlocked and settled into a posture of active defence and patrolling.Phillips (1957), p. 149 =Ortona= Throughout the week of 11‚Äì18 December, the 1st Parachute Battalion from the German 1st Parachute Division‚Äîwith supporting units‚Äîhad prepared strong defences within the Italian coastal town of Ortona. Paratroop engineers and infantry had destroyed much of Ortona itself, turning the streets into a debris-filled maze.Zuehlke (1999), p. 239 Major streets were mined, with demolition charges throughout the main piazza, and booby traps littered the town. German forces had also buried tanks in the rubble, leaving only the turrets exposed. On 20 December 1943, the under-strength Loyal Edmonton Regiment moved toward Ortona, with the Seaforth Highlanders covering their eastern flank. Throughout the day, they encountered heavy machine gun fire during their attempts to enter Ortona. By nightfall, both battalions held a toehold on the western edge of Ortona, yet had encountered heavy resistance in their attempts to secure it. The following day, D Company of the Loyal Edmonton Regiment launched attacks eastward towards the city centre, but accurate German sniper fire rapidly stalled the advance.Zuehlke (1999), pp. 259‚Äì260 Throughout the remainder of the week, the Battle of Ortona degenerated into a small-scale version of the Battle of Stalingrad, with vicious house-to-house fighting through the narrow streets and debris of Ortona.Copp (May 2007) Over the course of the battle, Canadian forces developed innovative \\"mouse-holing\\" tactics, moving between houses to avoid German sniper fire in the open streets.Bercuson, p. 176 German counterattacks on 24 and 26 December caused significant casualties to Canadian forces in the town. In danger of being outflanked by Allied advances west of Ortona, the 1st Parachute Regiment abandoned the town the following day, leaving Ortona to Canadian forces. Canadian casualties in the fighting for the town approached 650 killed or wounded.Zuehlke (2001), p. 161 =End of the Offensive= The battle continued for a few days after the fall of Ortona. With that town and Villa Grande captured, it looked as if it would require the Eighth Army only to regather itself and strike one more concentrated blow at Orsogna to complete the breaching of the Gustav Line's main Adriatic strongpoints. However, on 31 December, as V Corps probed along the coastal plain towards Pescara, a blizzard enveloped the battlefield. Drifting snow, sleet and biting winds paralysed movement and communications on the ground while cloud ceiling and visibility fell to nil and grounded the airforce. The Canadians managed to advance north from Casa Berardi along a ridge that ran alongside the Riccio River, and reached the coast at Torra Mucchia, to the east of the river mouth, on 4 January but inland Orsogna remained in German hands. Leese‚Äîrealising the Eighth Army no longer had the strength or conditions to force its way to Pescara and the Via Valeria to Rome‚Äîrecommended to General Alexander that the Eighth Army offensive should be halted to which Alexander agreed. Aftermath The allies had made gains and had broken into the Gustav Line but the failure to capture Orsogna put an end to the Allied plans of a strong drive up the eastern coast. Rain, flooded rivers, and high casualties, as well as the departure of Montgomery, all put a halt to Allied plans until the spring of 1944. After the offensive had ended, Alexander ordered aggressive patrolling in order to pin the units of the LXXVI Panzer Corps in the Adriatic sector and prevent Kesselring moving them to reinforce the XIV Panzer Corps front opposite Lieutenant General Mark W. Clark's U.S. Fifth Army where the Allied offensive would continue.Carver (2002), p. 103 In spite of this, three attempts during the winter of 1943/44 by the Fifth Army to break through into the Liri valley at Cassino failed. The offensive went on till 15 January when slowly some ground was gained and a few hilltops were secured but otherwise the weather and stiffening German resistance meant a breakthrough was unachievable. As spring approached in 1944, Alexander concentrated his forces in great secrecy by thinning out the Adriatic front and bringing the bulk of Eighth Army's striking power to the Cassino front. The combined attack of his two armies during the fourth and final Battle of Monte Cassino in early May took Kesselring by surprise and led to the Allied capture of the Italian capital of Rome in early June.

She is the only character to have appeared in every film in the series. Created by screenwriter Joe Augustyn and portrayed by actress Amelia Kinkade in three films between 1988 and 1997, she is a young woman possessed by a demon, and attacks her victims if they enter the property of Hull House. Angela is commonly identified by her black wedding dress, and her seductive, trance-seducing erotic dancing. But then just as quickly her disfigured face, burnt flesh caused by obsession of setting various body parts on fire, yellow glowing eyes, jagged teeth, and her deep maniacal voice. Wizard magazine rated her the 25th greatest villain.Wizard #177 Angela is portrayed by Amelia Kinkade in all three of the original films. The character was renamed Angela Feld in the 2009 remake, in which she is portrayed by Shannon Elizabeth.  Original films  = Background = Angela was once considered to be a gifted student, one of the best in her class. However, in her senior year, she adopted a Goth lifestyle, wearing all black and gaining the reputation of a witch from her classmates. Her only source of companionship is her best friend, Suzanne. = Night of the Demons (1988) = On Halloween Night, 1988, Angela and Suzanne hold a Halloween party at Hull House, a funeral parlor that had been abandoned years earlier after a series of murders were committed there. They invite seven classmates, and one who was not invited shows up. During the party, Angela decides to have a past life seance. Unfortunately, one of the teenagers interrupts the seance, which breaks the spell. Through this, a demon awakes in the crematorium of the house. It makes its way up into the living room and possesses Suzanne, who then possesses Angela. As the night progresses, Angela's personality changes. She begins dancing to disturbing songs in erotic fashions and killing her friends, turning them into demons. At daybreak the following morning, all of the demons are forced to abandon their hosts and return to hell. Only two teenagers, Judy Cassidy and Rodger Voorhees, are still alive. The police search the property and find all of the bodies, except for Angela's. They single her out as a suspect in the murders. = 1988 to 1993 = For six years, Hull House remains empty. Police keep a close watch on the house and continue the investigation. During those years, on some nights, people claim to see a ghostly figure of a woman in a black dress wandering around Hull House, and it looked like Angela Franklin. In 1993, the police close the investigation and stop watching Hull House. On Halloween Night of 1993, Angela's parents receive a greeting card with dried blood all over it. On it in blood is Angela's signature. That night, both of her parents commit suicide. Leaving a sole survivor of Angela's sister Melissa (Mouse) Franklin. = Night of the Demons 2 (1994) = Angela haunts Hull House freely, killing anyone who dares to go inside. Angela's sister, Melissa (Mouse) Franklin, now an orphan, is sent to St. Rita's Academy, a Catholic boarding school near Hull House. She constantly dreams about Angela. Her nightmares annoy her roommates Terri, Bibi, and the school bully, Shirley. A student at the school named Perry, interested in demonology, communicates with Angela. On Halloween, Shirley and her friends avoid the school dance and decide to throw a party at Hull House. During the party, Shirley pretends to use incantations to resurrect Angela, but the incantations work, and Angela returns. A priest from the school, Father Bob, retrieves the students, bringing them back to school. But before leaving, Shirley steals a tube of lipstick that had belonged to Suzanne, and brings it back to school. By doing so, this allows Angela to cross over the underground stream, the only thing separating the demons from the outside world. As the night progresses back at school, Angela possesses the students, such as Shirley, Z-Boy, and others. Angela captures Mouse and is going to use a ritual to sacrifice Mouse as an offering of her devotion to the devil. One of the nuns at the school, Sister Gloria, along with Bibi and her boyfriend, Johnny, use water balloons and a squirt gun filled with holy water to stop Angela and save Mouse. Angela turns into a giant, snake-like demon. The morning arrives and Angela dissolves into dust. = Night of the Demons 3 (1997) = Angela returns and continues to haunt Hull House in hopes of acquiring more party guests to take to hell. On Halloween Night a group of teens accidentally shoot a police officer and hide in Hull House. Angela appears and starts turning the group against each other and kills them off one by one, turning them into demons. Her primary target in the group is Holly, a virginal cheerleader who would be able help make Angela more powerful than ever. Holly and another teen, Nick survive. They destroy Angela by pulling her through the barrier of the underground stream. Angela melts into mush and her skeleton turns to dust. The two teens vow to keep a vigilant watch on Hull House every Halloween in case unsuspecting teenagers should decide to trespass on the property and become victims of Angela.  Remake  In the 2009 remake of the first film, Angela is given the surname Feld, and throws a Halloween party at the abandoned New Orleans mansion once owned by Lady Evangeline Broussard (who had, decades early, unintentionally summoned seven demons banished from Hell, which would have overtaken the world had she not deprived them of a seventh and final host by killing herself). Angela's party is ended prematurely when the police crash it and send everyone home, with her \\"business partner\\" absconding with all the money they had managed to make in the chaos. When things die down, Angela and a few of her friends become trapped in the mansion when the gates lock and refuse to open. After discovering a hidden chamber containing the skeletons of the six original demon hosts, Angela becomes possessed after being bitten by a skull while trying to pry a gold tooth out of it. The demon possessing Angela soon helps its brethren possess five of the others, but they ultimately fail to capture a girl named Maddie (who fakes killing herself to trick them) before sunrise, and dissolve, becoming trapped in limbo.

He was born the son and heir of Sir David II Strathbogie, Earl of Atholl, Constable of Scotland (who had been banished by Robert the Bruce) and Chief Warden of Northumberland, by his spouse Joan, elder daughter of Sir John Comyn of Badenoch, Joint Guardian of Scotland. This David of Strathbogie was summoned to the English parliament from 25 January 1330See the Foundation for Mediaeval Genealogy website for the 1330 summons to the _English_ parliament: to 24 July 1334, by Writs directed to David de Strabolgi comiti Athol. In 1330 the English Crown conferred upon him the castle and manor of Odogh, in Ireland, which had belonged to his great-uncle, Aymer de Valence, Earl of Pembroke. In 1332 he accompanied Edward Balliol into Scotland and was at the victory over Scottish forces at the battle of Dupplin Moor, 12 August 1332, following which Balliol restored to him his title and estates in Scotland. He rebelled in 1334, but was pardoned at the treaty of peace in 1335. He was killed fighting Sir Andrew Murray at the Battle of Culblean (or Kilblane), in a serious setback for Balliol's forces. He married Katherine, daughter of Henry de Beaumont, titular Earl of Buchan, by Alice, elder daughter and co-heiress of Sir Alexander Comyn. They had one son, and a probable daughter Isabel, wife of Sir Edmund de Cornwall, Knt. He was succeeded by his son and heir, David IV Strathbogie.

He was a member of the collaborationist government Nasjonal Samling in occupied Norway during World War II and a Standartenf√ºhrer (Colonel) in the Schutzstaffel. Pre-war career Riisn√¶s was an important public prosecutor in inter-war Norway, and had contacts in the international policing community. He is credited with introducing new investigative techniques, such as the use of police dogs, to Norway. Riisn√¶s was the public prosecutor in the famous case against Per Imerslund and other Norwegian Nazis who had broken into the home where Leon Trotsky had been staying before his deportation from Norway to Mexico. He was a supporter of Adolf Hitler, but broke all contact with his German friends when he was appointed by Parliament in January 1940 to investigate German espionage in Norway. Wartime collaborationist minister He was appointed councillor of state in the Nasjonal Samling (NS) government 1940‚Äì1941, and was one of nine Norwegians signing the declaration on 31 January 1942 which disbanded the Parliament of Norway and directed Quisling to formally take over the powers of government. He served as the Minister of Justice from 1941‚Äì1945. As Minister of Justice, Riisn√¶s was responsible for changing the Norwegian legal system to legitimise the Nazi actions, and authorized the persecution of those who would not cooperate with the German occupiers. Riisn√¶s held public speeches against Norwegian Jews.http://www.arkivportalen.no/side/arkiv/detaljer?arkivId=no-a1450-01000000445652https://www.arkivverket.no/utforsk- arkivene/andre-verdenskrig/nordmenn-i-fangenskap/jodar-i-noreg After World War II After collapse of the Quisling government at the end of the war, Jonas Lie, Henrik Rogstad and Riisn√¶s retreated to an NS gathering place outside of Oslo. Surrounded by the Home Front guard forces, Lie died probably of natural causes and Rogstad committed suicide. Riisn√¶s surrendered without a struggle.There are conflicting reports on the cause of death for Lie; the cited reference indicates suicide as the cause. After the war he was charged with treason, but his trial was suspended based on the defence that he was mentally ill. Riisn√¶s was hospitalized for this illness in the Reitgjerdet Hospital from 1948 to 1960. In 1974 he emigrated to Sicily, Italy, and later to Vienna, but returned to Oslo in 1985, where he lived for three years in a nursing home until his death. To this day, there are questions whether he feigned mental weakness. Literature * N.J.

The passport may also serve as proof of Norwegian citizenship and is valid for ten years. The colour of Norwegian passports was changed to red in the latest version. Previous Norwegian passports were burgundy-red, similar but not identical to the design of most EU countries. Despite the fact Norway is not part of the EU, the country is a signatory of the Schengen Agreement and a member state of the European Economic Area (EEA). Consequently, Norwegian citizens generally have the same rights as EU citizens in EEA countries and are treated as EU citizens for the purposes of travel and entry into EEA countries and Switzerland. According to Council Regulation (EC) 2252/2004 and 444/2009, Norwegian passports have to comply with minimum security standards. Norway is bound by the regulations as they constitute a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Agreement concluded by the Council of the European Union and Iceland and Norway. Types of passport Norway issues several types of passport and travel document: * Ordinary Norwegian passport, issued to Norwegian citizens. Their covers are red. * Refugee travel document, issued to those granted asylum in Norway. Their covers are green. * Immigrant passport, issued to those who lack Norwegian citizenship and have a residence permit in Norway, but cannot get a passport from their country of citizenship. Their covers are blue. Holders are not permitted to travel to their country of citizenship with the passport. * Immigrant passport for a single journey, issued to those who lack Norwegian citizenship and have a residence permit in Norway, but cannot get a passport from their country of citizenship in time for a sudden trip abroad. Their covers are also blue. The passport may only be used for a single journey. Physical appearance and data contained Current Norwegian passports are red in colour, with the coat of arms of Norway emblazoned in the top left of the front cover. The words \\"Kongeriket Norge\\", \\"Kongeriket Noreg\\", \\"Norgga gonagasriika\\" and \\"Kingdom of Norway\\" (\\"Kingdom of Norway\\" in Bokm√•l and Nynorsk (the two forms of Norwegian), S√°mi and English respectively) are inscribed in the bottom left corner and the word \\"Pass\\", \\"P√°ssa\\" and \\"Passport\\" emblazoned below the name of the country. In the bottom right corner is the standard biometric symbol. The previous version of the regular Norwegian passports was burgundy in colour, with the coat of arms of Norway emblazoned in the top of the front cover. The words \\"NORGE\\", \\"NOREG\\" and \\"NORWAY\\" (\\"Norway\\" in Bokm√•l, Nynorsk and English, respectively) are inscribed below the coat of arms and the word \\"PASS\\" and \\"PASSPORT\\" emblazoned below the name of the country.

New passports The Norweigan passport which was issued before October 2020 The Norwegian Police Directorate and Kripos (the national unit for combating organized and other serious crime) launched a design competition for new passports, ID-cards and travel documents. It was later announced that the winner of the competition was ‚ÄúThe Norwegian Landscape‚Äù by Neue Design Studio, an Oslo-based graphic design company. The new passports were set to be issued in 2016. But first Neue had to work closely with the National Police Directorate in order to combine the winning design with the necessary security measures that are required of passports. The purpose of the competition was to redesign the document with a high quality of design whilst still serving its purpose and functionality. Further, the new design was to increase the security of Norwegian passports, ID-cards and travel documents. In 2016 it was announced that the introduction of new passports was postponed to the middle of 2018. In August 2019 it was announced that the introduction of new passports was postponed for the seventh time, to October 2020.https://www.aftenposten.no/norge/i/qL7P5e/nye-pass-og-id-kort-er- forsinket-for-syvende-gang-naa-varsler-justisministeren-gjennomgang-av- politiets-prosjektstyring The new passports was introduced on 19 October 2020. =National ID card= National ID cards are scheduled to be released in November 2020. Citizens holding a national identity card, which states EEA or Swiss citizenship, can not only use it as an identity document within their home country, but also as a travel document to exercise the right of free movement in the EEA and Switzerland.ECB08: What are acceptable travel documents for entry clearance, UK Visas and Immigration. Retrieved 12 January 2015. Identity cards that do not state EEA or Swiss citizenship, including national identity cards issued to residents who are not citizens, are not valid as a travel document within the EEA and Switzerland. Identification requirements Application is done at special passport offices or embassies. When doing the application identification of the applicant is needed. This is done by:S√∏knad om pass (Norwegian text) *Showing a valid Norwegian passport, also expired, Norwegian driving licence, secure ID card with image e.g. issued by banks, or a letter of acquiring Norwegian citizenship. A person not possessing any of these identity documents must bring a person who vouches for the identity, is at least 18 years old, and has a valid Norwegian passport. Different spellings of the same name Names containing special letters (√¶, √∏, √•) are spelled the correct way in the non-machine-readable zone, but are mapped in the machine-readable zone, √¶ becoming \\"AE\\", √∏ becoming \\"OE\\", and √• becoming \\"AA\\". This follows the standard for machine-readable passports, which must not contain letters other than A‚ÄìZ. Manufacturing defect Machine- readable Norwegian passports issued between 1999 and 2005 suffered from a manufacturing defect that could result in the identity page coming loose, thus invalidating the passport. The Norwegian passport authorities replaced such passports free of charge. Visa requirements Visa requirements for Norwegian citizens As of 30 May 2019, Norwegian citizens had visa-free or visa on arrival access to 185 countries and territories, ranking the Norwegian passport fifth in the world in terms of travel freedom according to the Henley Passport Index.

The \\"Clark\\" flag was made in Vincennes, Indiana, and likely flew over Fort Sackville even before Clark arrived. Origins On 12 November 1778, Vincennes resident Fran√ßois Bosseron recorded the following items under the heading \\"\\"1778 fournie au Cap Helm pour les Compagnie des √âtats\\"\\":Somes, pg 75, records this same transaction, but gives the date as 2 November 1780. He speculates that the flag was made for the campaign of Augustin de La Balme. However, Busseron's original ledger clearly dates the transactions in 1778. It is in the Lasselle Collection, V91, Manuscripts Division, Indiana State Library. This flag was designed by Captain Leonard Helm, who held Fort Sackville until forced to surrender to Lieutenant Governor Henry Hamilton. Although historians are not sure exactly what it looked like, most US flags were based on the \\"stripes of rebellion.\\" Helm's design was clear enough that Hamilton recognized two on his approach to Vincennes, one on a boat and one on the fort.Hamilton's journal, 17 December 1778, \\"on my approach to St. Vincennes, was not a little surprised to see ... the American flag at the same time being displayed on the Fort.\\" One of these may have been Bosseron's flag, although Father Pierre Gibault may have brought a flag with him.Hamilton's Journal, 14 October 1778 (see External Links). Captain Helm had earlier brought a United States flag to Ouiatenon, so it is possible that he also had brought one to Vincennes. When Hamilton took the fort, he allowed Helm to take down \\"the continental flag\\" before raising the British flag.Barnhart, 202 George Rogers Clark National Historic Park Colors The choice of a red and green flag instead of red and white flag remains a mystery. It is possible that there simply was not enough white serge available in Vincennes at the time. It is worth noting, however, that whereas Colonel Clark had offered a red and white belts to American Indians in Cahokia to represent war or peace, Captain Helm presented the Wabash Indians with a red or green belts.Hamilton's journal, 14 October 1778 (evening) On December 27 at Vincennes, a Piankeshaw chief presented Lt-Gov Hamilton with red and green wampum, which was said to represent the Wabash River.Hamilton's journal, 27 December 1778 The stripes, themselves, were a defining feature of British American flags even before the Revolution, and many military banners used by Americans featured stripes of differing colors.Mastai, pg 25 Records describe flags similar or identical to this in the 13 colonies.Mastai, pg 25, quotes a record of a Philadelphia ship in 1775 listing \\"A Union Flagg, Green and Red, 13 stripes.\\" It is possible that Busseron ordered the banner for his own militia unit in Vincennes, when they declared for the United States. George Rogers Clark Which flag design Clark's men actually marched behind is not known. In his memoir, Clark says he had 10 or 12 sets of colors when they took Vincennes. Some theorize that he probably marched under the flag of Virginia, his home state, but Lt-Gov Henry Hamilton refers to several \\"American\\" flags in his journal entries as he leads his expedition down the Wabash River, including a \\"rebel flag\\" he received at Ouiatenon on 4 December. When Clark arrived in Vincennes on 23 February 1779, he used many banners to give the impression of a large army. Clark's Captain Bowman notes in his journal that an \\"American flag\\" was raised over Ft Sackville on 25 February 1778, but does not describe it. Locust Grove, Clark's final residence. Of all the flags which may have been used during Clark's Illinois campaign, the 13-striped, red and green banner is the only banner historically documented, and was one of the first \\"American Flags\\" flown in the modern State of Indiana. The pattern has been flown by Indiana National Guard units deployed to both Iraq and Afghanistan.The Hoosier Patriot, March 2010 Even though Clark, himself, probably never used it, the flag bears his name and is sold by flag retailers as a \\"George Rogers Clark flag.\\" It is often flown at events in Indiana and Illinois to represent Clark's historic ties with those states. A red and green flag is still flown at the George Rogers Clark National Historic Park, and at the Locust Grove plantation near Louisville, Kentucky, where George Rogers Clark died.

Zebra was built by Thames Iron Works and launched in 1895 as the fifth Royal Navy ship to be named Zebra. Entering service in 1900, Zebra was sold for scrap in 1914. Construction HMS Zebra was ordered on 7 February 1894 from Thames Iron Works, Blackwall, London as part of the British Admiralty's 1893‚Äì1894 shipbuilding programme, one of 36 \\"Twenty-seven Knotter\\" destroyers ordered from 14 different shipbuilders for this programme.Lyon 2001, p. 19.Lyon 2001, p. 91. These destroyers were not of a standard design, with the Admiralty laying down broad requirements, including a trial speed of , a \\"turtleback\\" forecastle and a standard armament of a QF 12 pounder 12 cwt ( calibre) gun on a platform on the ship's conning tower (in practice the platform was also used as the ship's bridge), with a secondary armament of five 6-pounder guns, and two 18 inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes.Lyon 2001, p. 20.Lyon 2001, pp. 98‚Äì99.Friedman 2009, p. 40. Thames Iron Work's design had three funnels, with the forward funnel widely separated from the other two, with one of the two torpedo tubes positioned in this gap. Three White water-tube boilers fed four-cylinder reciprocating steam engines rated at and driving two shafts.Friedman 2009, pp. 44‚Äì45. Zebra was laid down on 1 July 1894 and launched on 13 December 1895. Thames Iron Works was relatively inexperienced in building torpedo craft (it had previously built the hull of a single torpedo boat as a subcontractor for Maudslay, Sons and Field (who supplied the engines for Zebra) and it took a long time for the ship to be completed and to complete trials (where she eventually reached the contract speed of 27 knotsBrassey 1902, p. 274.), not being accepted by the Navy until January 1900. Zebra was not particularly successful in service and no further orders for destroyers were placed with Thames Iron Works for many years. Operational history HMS Zebra served in British home waters for the whole of her career. In January 1900 she was employed as tender to the Wildfire, special service vessel, for training duties in connection with Sheerness Naval School of Gunnery. The following year she participated in the 1901 British Naval Manoeuvres.Brassey 1902, p. 91. In March 1902 Lieutenant James W. G. Innes was appointed in command, but the appointment was cancelled and Lieutenant Wyndham L. Bamber was appointed in command the following month. She served in the Portsmouth Instructional flotilla in May 1902, and took part in the fleet review held at Spithead on 16 August 1902 for the coronation of King Edward VII. Zebra formed part of the 6th Destroyer Flotilla in 1910, and in 1912. On 14 June 1911 the destroyer collided with Zebra during night exercises off the mouth of the River Thames. One of Zebras six-pounder guns and two of her boats were knocked into the sea, but no crew were injured. After repair, Zebra was attached to the submarine flotilla based at Dundee, relieving the destroyer . On 30 August 1912 the Admiralty directed all destroyers were to be grouped into classes designated by letters based on contract speed and appearance. Like all the surviving Twenty-six and Twenty-seven Knotters, Zebra was assigned to the A Class.Gardiner and Gray 1985, p. 18.Manning 1961, pp. 17‚Äì18. The class letters were painted on the hull below the bridge area and on a funnel.Manning 1961, p. 34. By March 1913, Zebra was laid up at Sheerness and listed for sale. Zebra was sold for scrapping on 30 July 1914.

Synopsis The playlet involves a young woman coming home, tired, after a busy day at a war plant. Each time she comes in there is a letter from her husband overseas, and she remembers their conversations before he went off to war. She was concerned about him, because she felt it was a \\"young man's war\\" and he should stay home with her and the baby. However he was insistent that his country needed him. The plot then turns to the husband trying to manage his ship while it is being attacked by a submarine. The next day, the woman receives another letter from her husband, who is shown in double exposure, reminding her that freedom comes high, often at the price of human lives. The door bell rings, and it is a Western Union telegram, saying that her husband died. The point of the film was to communicate to the American people that many of their sons and husbands who were going overseas, would not be coming back, and that they would have to understand they would be sacrificing their loved ones to secure freedom. Given the extraordinary sensitivity of the subject matter, the government short is notable both as propaganda and as a meditation on what has to be sacrificed for the maintenance of freedom.

A German passport is, besides the German ID card and the German Emergency Travel Document (called \\"Reiseausweis als Passersatz\\"), the only other officially recognised document that German authorities will routinely accept as proof of identity from German citizens. Besides serving as proof of identity and presumption of German nationality, they facilitate the process of securing assistance from German consular officials abroad (or other EU members in the case that a German consular facility is absent). German passports are valid for ten years (for people over the age of 24) or six years (for people under the age of 24) and share the standardised layout and burgundy red design with other EU passports. Every German citizen is also a citizen of the European Union. The passport, along with the national identity card, allows for free rights of movement and residence in any of the states of the European Union, European Economic Area, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. History From 1949 until 1950, the issuance of West German passports mainly fell under the authority of the Allied High Commission which governed West Germany at that time. On 1 January 1950, the German Office for Entry and Exit Affairs became the main authority for issuing West German passports, although it was still under the control of the Allied High Commission. Only on 1 February 1951 did West Germany gain full rights to issue its own passports independent of the Allied occupying forces.Ausstellung von P√§ssen, Mitteilung des BmdI vom 14. Dezember 1950 ‚Äì 1211 C ‚Äì 662/50, GMBI, S.13 West German passports at that time contained a \\"Job Description\\" field of the passport holder; this was initially necessary as the Allied occupying forces reserved the right to approve West German citizens obtaining travel visas until 1955. The \\"Job Description\\" field was eliminated after a passport regulation change on 12 June 1967. After the reunification of Germany in 1990, residents of the former East Germany were allowed to use valid East German passports for overseas travel until 31 December 1995, after which they were automatically deemed invalid and these people had to apply for and obtain a German passport to travel overseas. Time of processing Processing time for a German passport is usually four to six weeks, but one can be issued in three days by using the Express service if processed before 11 a.m. Physical appearance First page of a contemporary German passport (March 2017) Signature page and data page of a contemporary German passport (March 2017) Data page of a contemporary German passport glowing under UV-light irradiation Visa section of a contemporary German passport (March 2017) Signature page and data page of a German passport (Pre-March 2017) German passports have, since 1 January 1988, followed the standard European Union passport design, with burgundy red cover and the German Eagle emblazoned in the centre of the front cover. The word \\"Reisepass\\" (German for travel passport) is inscribed below the coat of arms, with Europ√§ische Union (German for European Union) and Bundesrepublik Deutschland (German for Federal Republic of Germany) appear above. On 23 February 2017, Germany unveiled a new passport design to be put in use from 1 March 2017.

The country code is not DEU as is the standard country code for Germany (according to ISO 3166-1 alpha-3), but D. This is the only country/citizen code which does not consist of 3 letters. In November 2001, the so-called Identigram feature was added ‚Äì a number of holographic security elements, including a three-dimensional eagle, a holographic copy of the holder's picture (the so-called Holographic Shadow Picture), a holographic copy of the machine-readable zone, holographic microprinting, and kinematic elements. =Following page= The following page lists: * Residence * Height * Colour of eyes (in German language) * Religious name or pseudonym Interior of a German passport (pre-March 2017, with passport number at the bottom of each page removed) =Languages= The data page/information page is printed in German, English, and French.

It might be necessary to make a name declaration. * Confirmation of deregistration (\\"Abmeldebescheinigung\\") from the German place of residence if it is entered in the current passport as the place of residence, and one copy thereof. * Valid residency permit, and one copy thereof. * Your driver's license or a utility bill in your name as proof of legal address, and one copy thereof. * Your German doctorate certificate if you would like to have your German doctorate degree entered in your passport, and one copy thereof * If applicable, German naturalisation document, and one copy thereof * If dual citizen, Naturalization Certificate with \\"Beibehaltungsgenehmigung‚Äù * Passport fee * Your Family Register Extract may be needed. * If it is the first time you apply as an adult you will need your parents' German passports or a Certificate of Nationality (\\"Staatsangeh√∂rigkeitsausweis\\"). =RFID chip with biometric certificate= Since 1 November 2005, German passports have had a contactless smartcard (proximity card) chip and 13.56 MHz loop antenna embedded into the front cover page,, page 8 in accordance with ICAO standards. The chip and antenna are not easily visually recognisable, but their presence is indicated using the ICAO biometric passport symbol at the bottom of the front cover. It carries all the data printed in the passport, including a JPEG file of the photo, protected by a digital signature. Germany therefore became only the fifth country in the world (after Malaysia, Thailand, Sweden, and Australia) to introduce biometric passports. On 1 November 2007, several changes were made to the passport: * Applicants have to provide, in addition to the traditional passport data, scans of two fingerprints, which are added to the chip. * The previously 9-digit, all-numeric, sequentially assigned serial number was replaced with a new alphanumeric pseudorandomly assigned higher-entropy serial number, to increase the entropy of the serial number from the previous 35 digits to 45 bits.Dennis K√ºgler, BSI, talk at CeBIT 2008 This improves the cryptographic key strength of the Basic Access Control mechanism of the RFID chip by 10 bits, which makes a brute force attack approximately 1000 times more expensive. * The validity period of passports issued to holders under the age of 24 increases from five to six years; older applicants receive a passport valid for ten years. =Different spellings of the same name within the same document= German names: German names containing umlauts (√§, √∂, √º) and/or √ü are spelled in the correct way in the non-machine-readable zone of the passport, but with AE, OE, UE, and/or SS in the machine-readable zone, e.g. M√ºller becomes MUELLER, Gro√ü becomes GROSS, and G√∂√ümann becomes GOESSMANN. The transcription mentioned above is generally used for aircraft tickets etc., but sometimes (like in US visas) also simple vowels are used (MULLER, GOSSMANN), so passport, visa, and aircraft ticket may display different spellings of the same name. The three possible spelling variants of the same name (e.g. M√ºller / Mueller / Muller) in different documents sometimes lead to confusion, and the use of two different spellings within the same document may give persons unfamiliar with German orthography the impression that the document is a forgery. Non-German names: In some names of naturalised citizens, some special letters that are not available may always be replaced by simple letters, also in the non-machine-readable zone. The \\"Bundesdruckerei AG,\\" which prints the German passports, uses the font LA8 Passport, which includes a Latin subset of the Unicode characters (ISO 10646), so that letters such as √ß and ≈Ç can be displayed at least in the non-machine- readable passport zone. In the machine-readable zone, special characters are either replaced by simple characters ( e.g., √© becomes E) or transcribed according to the ICAO rules (e.g., √• becomes AA, √∏ becomes OE, etc.). Names originally written in a non-Latin writing system may pose another problem if there are various internationally recognised transcription standards. For example, the Russian surname –ì–æ—Ä–±–∞—á—ë–≤ is transcribed :\\"Gorbatschow\\" in German, :\\"Gorbachev\\" in English (also ICAO standard), :\\"Gorbatchov\\" in French, :\\"Gorbachov\\" in Spanish, :\\"Gorbaczow\\" in Polish, and so on. German naming law accepts umlauts and/or √ü in family names as a reason for an official name change (even just the change of the spelling, e.g. from M√ºller to Mueller or from Wei√ü to Weiss is regarded as a name change). Issuing process German passports are issued, just like German ID cards, by local municipal registration offices. Applicants have to apply for a new passport in person and the data in newly issued passports is essentially an authenticated copy of the personal data found in locally stored registration documents. Passports are then manufactured centrally at the Bundesdruckerei in Berlin. If the necessity can be proven, more than one passport can be issued with overlapping validity (e.g. when travelling to Arab countries with an Israeli stamp in the passport, or when needed for professional reasons). In theory, a person can concurrently hold up to ten passports. The additional passports have six instead of ten years validity. A German passport (32 pages, delivered within a month, issued to a person 24 years and older) costs ‚Ç¨60.¬ß 15 of the German Passverordnung (passport regulation) A passport for a person under the age of 24 which has a validity of six years costs ‚Ç¨37.50. A 48 pages passport costs a premium of ‚Ç¨22, express delivery a premium of ‚Ç¨32. Child's Passport A type of passport issued by Germany since 2006 is a child passport (in German: Kinderreisepass). Unlike a regular German passport, the Kinderreisepass does not include biometric features and lacks the inscription \\"European Union\\" at the top of the front cover. The exclusion of biometric information is due to the ongoing development of infants and young children and the low security risk they pose; nevertheless, the photo used in the passport does have to comply with biometric standards. All other features are similar to those of a regular passport: the burgundy red colour and the German coat of arms printed at the centre of the front cover. Children's passports are issued for children up to twelve years of age and are valid for a period of six years. When a child reaches the age of twelve, a regular passport must be obtained for international travel. A child passport has sixteen pages (unlike the regular's 32), of which eleven are designated for stamping and the others are used for a title page, instructions and personal information. The first page features the words ‚ÄúChild's Passport‚Äù in three languages: German, English, and French. Unlike a regular passport, the information pages in a Kinderreisepass are not security laminated (yet do have other security features) and have a different format. The information included is more or less the same, with the following differences: The type of passport is PC (Passport for children) instead of P (Passport). As in other passports, the main information page ends with a 2-line machine-readable code, according to ICAO standard 9303. A child passport serves just like any other passport, with the exception that it is not biometric (or e-Passport). As a result, travelling to the US, for example, requires a tourist visa in spite of Germany's participation in the United States Visa Waiver Program. Alternatively, infants and children of any age are allowed to obtain a regular German passport (biometric) instead of a child's passport, which nevertheless has the advantages of low cost, short processing times, and being issuable by honorary consuls (making them easier to obtain by German emigrants who live far away from a German embassy or consulate). Just like provisional passports, children's passports are issued without being sent to the Bundesdruckerei GmbH in Berlin, which is the main reason behind these advantages. Holding a second passport =Second German passport= Germany allows its citizens in exceptional cases to hold more than one valid German passport to circumvent certain travel restrictions. (For example, some Arab countries refuse entry if the passport contains an Israeli stamp; journalists may need several passports when travelling abroad when passports have been sent to consular officials for visas that take a long time to issue.) In extreme cases, up to 10 German passports can be held at the same time. However, these additional passports are valid for only 6 years even if the \\"original\\" passport is valid for 10 years. =Dual citizenship= The right to hold both a German passport and a foreign passport at the same time (dual citizenship) is restricted under the current German nationality law. Germany allows dual citizenship with other EU countries and Switzerland; dual citizenship with other countries is possible with special permission or if obtained at birth (for example, one German parent and one foreign parent, or if a child is born to German parents in a jus soli country such as the United States of America). Under Article 116 par. 2 of the Basic Law (Grundgesetz), former German citizens who between January 30, 1933, and May 8, 1945, were deprived of their German citizenship on political, racial, or religious grounds may re-invoke their citizenship and the same applies to their descendants, and are permitted to hold dual (or multiple) citizenship. Children born on or after 1 January 2000 to non-German parents acquire German citizenship at birth if at least one parent has a permanent residence permit (and had this status for at least three years) and the parent was residing in Germany for at least eight years. The children must have lived in Germany for at least eight years or attended school for six years until their 21st birthday. Non-EU- and non-Swiss-citizen parents born and grown up abroad usually cannot have dual citizenship themselves (but exceptions are made for citizens of countries that do not allow the renunciation of citizenship or have too expensive / difficult / humiliating renunciation procedures and for citizens whose citizenship was restored under Article 116 (2)). Naturalized Germans can lose their German citizenship if it is found out that they got it by willful deceit / bribery / menacing / giving intentionally false or incomplete information that had been important for the naturalization process if they still own a citizenship of a different country. In June 2019, it was decided to prolong the deadline from 5 to 10 years after naturalization. A law adopted in June 2019 allows the revocation of the German citizenship of dual citizens who have joined or supported a terror militia such as the Islamic State and are at least 18 years old. The travel freedom of German citizens Visa requirements for German citizens Visa requirements for German citizens are administrative entry restrictions by the authorities of other states placed on citizens of Germany. As of 7 January 2020, German citizens had visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to 189 countries and territories, ranking the German passport third in the world in terms of travel freedom (tied with the South Korean passport) as well as the most powerful passport in Europe and the EU according to the Henley Passport Index. German citizens can live and work in any country within the EU as a result of the right of free movement and residence granted in Article 21 of the EU Treaty.Treaty on the Function of the European Union (consolidated version) Gallery of German passports File:1927 German Ministerialpass.jpg1927 German Ministerialpass issued to Dr. Fritz Norden File:World War Two issued German Diplomatic passport.jpgWorld War II issued German Diplomatic passport File:1944 issued German service passport for use by an official abroad.jpg1944 issued German service passport for use by an official abroad File:1950 Allied Military Government issued passport for German nationals.jpg1950 Allied Military Government issued temporary passport for German nationals File:1950 Allied Military Government issued German passport for stateless & undefined persons.jpg1950 Allied Military Government issued temporary German passport for stateless & undefined persons File:1951 West German Ministerialpass used for the Washington.jpg1951 West German Ministerialpass used for the U.S. File:1953 West German diplomatic passport used for Hong Kong.jpg1953 West German diplomatic passport used for Hong Kong File:Old German passport.jpgFront cover of a West German passport issued in 1982 File:German passport European Community.jpgFront cover of a machine-readable, non- biometric German passport (with \\"European Community\\" wording on top) issued in 1998 File:Reisepass.jpgFront cover of a machine-readable, non-biometric German EU passport issued from the early-2000s until November 2005 File:Vorl√§ufiger deutscher Reisepass - gr√ºn.jpgProvisional German passport issued in exceptional circumstances File:German Passport Refugee 2017.jpgRefugee Convention travel document 2017 See also * German identity card * Passports of the European Union References External links * http://www.epass.de/ * Germany : Child's Passport (2006 ‚Äî 2015) Issued in Peking, China + 2 Residence Permits Category:Passports by country Category:Identity documents of Germany Category:European Union passports ","title":"German passport"},{"id":"11786009","text":"Carlo Dalmazio Minoretti (17 September 1861 - 13 March 1938) was a Cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church who served as Archbishop of Genoa.

Before first being called \\"CTSD\\" in 1978, the Westinghouse industrial and electric utility gas turbine business operation progressed through several other names starting with Small Steam & Gas Turbine Division (SSGT) in the 1950s through 1971, then Gas Turbine Systems Division (GTSD) and Generation Systems Division (GSD) through the mid-late 1970s. The name CTSD came with the passage of energy legislation by the US government in 1978 which prohibited electric utilities from building new base load power plants that burned natural gas. Some participants in the industry decided to use the name \\"combustion turbine\\" in an attempt to gain some separation from the fact that the primary fuel for gas turbines in large power plants is natural gas. Commonly referred to as a gas turbine, a modern combustion turbine can operate on a variety of gaseous and liquid fuels. The preferred liquid fuel is No. 2 distillate. With proper treatment, crude and residual oil have been used. Fuel gases range from natural gas (essentially methane) to low-heating-value gases such as produced by gasification of coal or heavy liquids, or as by-product gases from blast furnaces. In fact, most gas turbines today are installed with dual- or multi- fuel capability to take advantage of changes in cost and availability of various fuels. Increased capability to burn high-hydrogen-content fuel gas has also been demonstrated, and the ability to operate on 100% hydrogen for zero carbon dioxide emissions is under development. The story of Westinghouse gas turbine experience lists the many \\"firsts\\" achieved during the more than 50 years prior to the sale of the Power Generation Business Unit to Siemens, AG in 1998. As indicated below, the history actually begins with the successful development of the first fully US-designed jet engine during World War II. The first industrial gas turbine installation took place in 1948 with the installation of a 2000 hp W21 at Mississippi River Fuel Corp. gas compression station at Wilmar, Arkansas, USA.  Early history  Westinghouse has a long history in the industrial and electric power steam turbine industry dating back to the late 1800s and early 1900s. The steam turbine manufacturing plant in Lester, PA was built in 1917-1919 greatly expanding the company's manufacturing capacity. \\"The South Philadelphia Works\\" as it was known become a key part of the original Westinghouse Electric Company's industrial complex, complementing other large factories in East Pittsburgh, PA and Hamilton, Ontario. Westinghouse history with gas turbines began in the early 1940s with the contract signed in 1943 with the US Navy Bureau of Aeronautics to develop the first US-designed jet engine. An outcome of this was the establishment in 1945 of the Aviation Gas Turbine Division, with headquarters in Kansas City, Kansas, until it closed in 1960. During the late 1940s, Westinghouse began applying its gas turbine technology to industrial land-based prime movers. A summary of the early applications can be found in an ASME paper presented by Westinghouse engineers at the 1994 ASME International Gas Turbine Conference in the Hague. It is entitled \\"Evolution of Heavy-Duty Power Generation and Industrial Gas Turbines in the United States\\" and it also provides good summary of the Westinghouse gas turbine technology development through the mid-1990s. The following compilation is based on information in that ASME paper as well as other sources as cited, and upon personal accounts of Westinghouse engineers who had direct experience or close connections to the material presented. = Early Land-Based Applications = Westinghouse experience with land-based gas turbines started as early as 1945 with the development of a 2000 hp (~1500 kW) gas turbine generator set, the W21. It had a thermal efficiency of 18% (LHV). The first application of the W21 in an industrial setting was in 1948 as a gas-compressor drive installed at the Mississippi River Fuel Corp. facility located at Wilmar, Arkansas. Reports have it that this was the first industrial gas turbine in the world to accumulate 100,000 hours of operation before it was retired. By 1948, Westinghouse also built an experimental 4000 hp gas turbine-driven locomotive with the Baldwin Company (Chester, PA) that used two of these units. Initial operation was on the Union Pacific Railroad burning distillate fuel oil. Later, operation was on the Pittsburgh and Lake Eire Railroad using residual oil fuel. The vast majority of the early applications of Westinghouse land- based gas turbines were for industrial mechanical drives in the petrochemical industry, both in the US and abroad. Large multiple orders were placed by pipeline companies looking for compressor drives to be placed at remote locations. But by the mid-1950s gas turbine power plants were becoming recognized as a practical alternative to steam turbine generators for certain applications, first for industry and later for electric utilities. For industrial \\"total energy\\" applications, the important factor was that gas turbines, combined with heat recovery boilers, offered a higher power-to-steam ratio than the traditional back-pressure steam turbines used to supply both power and process steam. So, gas turbines were put to use for combined heat and power by the petrochemical industry, working hand-in-hand with companies like Westinghouse, well before the word \\"cogeneration\\" entered the modern lingo some 30 years later. Note is added here to acknowledge the pioneering work by Westinghouse in the unique application of a W201 installed at U.S. Steel works in Chicago (1960). The engine was used to drive a 12,500 scfm fan to blow air into a blast furnace, and the design requirement was to use blast furnace exhaust gas as its fuel. The engine was modified so that all compressor discharge could be removed and fed to an external burner, from which products of combustion were returned to drive the turbine. Typically, blast furnace gas has a heating value of less than 100 Btu/scf, one-tenth of that of natural gas.  Pioneering power generation applications  Westinghouse sought application of its gas turbine technology in the power generation industry, which, after all, was the primary focus of its business. If the gas-turbine side of the business was to grow and thrive, it had to find its way into the power generation sector. = West Texas Utilities among the first = In 1952, West Texas Utilities, Stockton, TX, helped pioneer power generation application of gas turbines with the installation of a Westinghouse model W81, rated at 5000 kW. That was followed by a second W81 in 1954 (possibly 1958 based on a second source). Both units were used in continuous (base load) operation and the exhaust heat from the second unit was used to heat feed water for a steam boiler at the site. In 1959, it was integrated with a fired boiler to form a \\"combined cycle\\" (gas and steam) power generating system. Five years later, in 1964, the same utility installed the first pre-engineered combined cycle power plant at its San Angelo, TX, power station. The Westinghouse gas turbine used for that application was a supercharged model W301, nominally rated at 25 MW. The rating on the steam turbine was 85 MW, for an overall combined cycle plant output of about 110 MW, and the thermal efficiency achieved was more than 39%, the record for gas- fired power plants in the US for quite some time. The W301, the first Westinghouse direct-drive (3600RPM) unit, was the immediate predecessor of the model W501, introduced in 1967/68 with an initial rating of 40 MW (ISO/gas). (Note: some ratings listed in early publications used NEMA site conditions, i.e., 1000 ft elevation and , which reduces power output by 7.5% below that at ISO (sea level, conditions.)) = SoCalEd and Garden State Paper install \\"total energy system\\" = In 1967, Westinghouse supplied a 15 MW W191 pre- packaged gas turbine generator for a pioneering on-site industrial combined heat and power (CHP) or \\"cogeneration\\" application. The Southern California Edison Company (SCE) partnered with the Garden State Paper Company (GSP) to install and operate an on-site gas-turbine generator and heat recovery system to supply all the energy needs of a patented de-inking process to produce clean newsprint from used newspapers. This unique early example of a \\"total- energy\\" system provided the operating flexibility, operating economics, site compatibility, and reliability to make it the ideal solution for both partners. SCE supplied both electricity and heat energy while GSP enjoyed the advantage of low cost, reliable on-site energy located at the process plant. The gas turbine generator was electrically tied to the SCE grid, which took the excess power generated. Henry Vogt Co. supplied the fired heat recovery boiler with a standby forced draft fan for backup duty. The plant went commercial in January 1967. = Dow Chemical's early venture into gas turbines = The first five production W501 engines were installed during 1968 to 1971 to supply power and steam at Dow Chemical facilities in Texas and Louisiana. The fact that Dow had previously installed four W301 units at its Texas Division, Freeport, TX, was key to their decision to go ahead with the follow- on orders for the larger W501 units. In fact, the prototype supercharged W301 installed at Freeport, TX in 1965 was Dow's first venture into gas turbines for on-site power generation, and Westinghouse remained a major supplier of Dow's gas turbines for years to come. The first W501A installed by Dow Chemical at its Freeport, TX, complex in 1968 (photo) was supercharged to enhance performance and available exhaust energy. Small \\"helper\\" steam turbine, coupled to generator was used for starting the gas turbine. In early applications, Dow typically used gas turbine exhaust as pre-heated \\"air\\" for fully fired boilers. Supercharging fans provided flow to boilers (via bypass duct) in event of gas turbine outage. = Salt Grass Combined Cycle ‚Äì a major milestone = Although not built as a Dow-owned facility on Dow property, the 300 MW Salt Grass Combined Cycle plant, using 4xW501 units (1xW501A, 3xW501AA), was built as a dedicated power supply for Dow's Freeport, TX, expanding operations. The plant was designed, built and owned by Power Systems Engineering (PSE) in 1970-1972. (PSE was later incorporated into DESTEC Energy after being acquired by Dow in 1989. DESTEC later morphed into Dynegy a major independent power generating company.) Unlike most industrial generating plants, there was to be no process steam requirement for the Salt Grass plant; all output from the plant was to be in the form of electric energy. The design objective was to use the largest gas turbines available and, based on prior experience, to use unfired heat recovery boilers for operating simplicity and improved reliability. All steam was used to drive 4 identical 25 MW steam turbines coupled to the gas turbines at the outboard end of the generators (which in turn were mounted on the cold compressor-end of the rotor). The plant comprised four separate single-shaft combined cycle units for maximum operating flexibility. It also included a start-up boiler to enable the steam turbines to be used to start the gas turbines. Construction of the Salt Grass plant began in January, 1970 and the first GT unit was operational 12 months later, according to a joint PSE/Dow paper presented at the time. Westinghouse records show that he fourth GT was in commercial operation early in 1972, so the entire plant was completed in just over two years. PSE was founded by two ex-Westinghouse engineers from the Houston field sales office, Tom McMichael (Sales Engineer) and Al Smith (District Manager). As such the both had a unique relationship with Dow and had been instrumental in previous Westinghouse business with Dow. According to a paper co-authored by Al Smith in 1971, the idea for the plant was conceived by PSE and Dow in early 1969. The Salt Grass plant was their first venture after they decided to go out on their own.  The blackout of 1965  Although only anecdotal, it has been said that there was an increase in the birthrate in the northeastern US and parts of Canada during the summer of 1966. This was just one of the results of the Great Northeast Blackout which took place on November 9, 1965, nine months before the mini baby boom. Another, somewhat more important result to Westinghouse CTSD was the birth of the modern gas turbine industry in the U.S. Although the actual culprit behind the massive power outage was found to be a single faulty relay at a transmission station in Ontario, Canada, the \\"cascade\\" or domino effect on downstream trunk lines caused the entire CANUSE system from Canada, through Buffalo, NY and to the east coast from New York City to Maine to fail in 15 minutes. An important ramification of this event was recognition of the need to strengthen the grid and improve system restart capabilities. Electric utilities throughout the U.S. were mandated by their regional \\"Reliability Councils\\" (e.g. NERC for the northeast) to increase their system reserve margins by installing a certain percentage of their overall capacity in the form of smaller localized fast-start generating units, much of them with ‚Äòblack start‚Äô capability to assure that large plants and grids could be restarted in the event of another major outage. It didn't hurt that the summers of 1966 and 1968 saw major summer heat waves and record peak demands, and that the base load demand on the US electric utilities were growing at a steady 6% to 7% annual rate. There was already a boom for large coal-fired steam plants and this growth was seen as going on for the foreseeable future. = A Wave of Gas Turbine Installations = The result was a wave of gas turbine generator installations, chosen as the fastest and most economical way to meet the mandate for reliability and to meet the steady growth of demand. (Ergo, the Westinghouse CTSD \\"The Economic Choice\\" marketing campaign at the time.) Annual utility purchases of additional units became a routine event as long as the peak load demand continued to increase. Based on comments from Westinghouse CTSD sales veterans, large orders of multiple units were often taken over the phone, as repeat customers raced to obtain their annual allotment. Tracking the regional and national peak demand curves became the main tool to planners who had to forecast the market and set the shop \\"load plan\\". (This writer wonders whether the GT suppliers of that time developed \\"reserve agreements\\" as was the practice adopted during another boom period, 30 years later.) Accordingly, most gas turbines installed in the US during the late 1960s and early 1970s were applied as simple cycle peaking units (\\"peakers\\"), intended for system backup and intermittent use, and installed to maintain adequate reserve margin. Importantly, the early 1970s also witnessed the success of the early combined cycle plants and, as the peaking market started to level off, and, for the time being, this helped sustain the U.S. utility market for large gas turbines. One report has it that the demand for gas turbines in the U.S. hit almost 9 _GW_ in 1969, a 30-fold increase over the total of 300 _MW_ sold in 1961. (The chart below shows that market for larger units (>20 MW) peaked at around 7 GW.) US Gas Turbine Market Data - source: Gas Turbine World Magazine May‚ÄìJune 2011 (with permission) No wonder that forecasts for future market growth were so optimistic. At the start of 1970, Turbine Topics, the internal newsletter of the Small Steam & Gas Turbine Division (predecessor of the Gas Turbine Division) contained this statement from the Marketing Department: \\"The sum total of all this tells us that the fantastic growth of the 60s will perpetuate into the 70s\\". (Source: Personal collection.) However, by 1971/1972 the market had already shown signs of weakening, and, unfortunately, subsequent global events had a lot to say about whether that rosy forecast would come true. US gas turbine market from 1965-1990, with forecast to 2000, (at right) shows how the northeast blackout of 1965 accelerated the growth of electric utility market for gas turbines in the US. Later events, most notably the 1973 Arab Israeli war, followed by the 1974 OPEC oil embargo and the U.S. Fuel Use Act of 1978, caused a steep decline. A strong recovery followed with the rise of the Independent Power Producer (\\"IPP\\") cogeneration market under the Public Utility Regulatory Policy Act (PURPA), upheld by the US Supreme  Round Rock - A case of bad timing  Based on the surge of gas turbine business in the late 1960s, Westinghouse (following the example of market leader and archrival General Electric) decided to build a modern new gas turbine manufacturing plant at Round Rock, TX, near Austin. However, by the time that the plant went into operation around the 1972 timeframe, the US market for gas turbines was about to collapse due to the impact of the 1973 Arab-Israeli war and subsequent fears of fuel supply instability due to the OPEC oil embargo (see market data chart, above). Also, unlike GE's Greeneville,SC, plant, the new Round Rock factory was not built as a stand-alone plant with full manufacturing capabilities, as already existed in Lester. Major components were shipped from Lester (and other suppliers) for final assembly at Round Rock. As the market collapsed (see chart, above), it didn't take very long for Westinghouse management to act reduce the surplus of shop space allocated to gas turbines. Since Round Rock could not survive on its own, it was ultimately abandoned as a gas turbine manufacturing facility in 1976. Other large rotating equipment operations moved in, such as those of the E. Pittsburgh DC products and Buffalo Large Motors Division. Ultimately, the large motors operations of Westinghouse were sold to Taiwan Electric Co. (TECO) and the plant is now owned by TECO-Westinghouse, and is used to serve its wind generator business.  Technology evolves rapidly as market grows  In spite of the fact that it might appear to have been a sellers‚Äô market for peaking units during the late 1960s/early ‚Äò70s, there was still fierce competition for market share. Besides having adequate shop space to serve the market, the major manufactures (i.e. GE vs. Westinghouse) were in a race to find ways to lower the price ($/kW) of their offering to get the competitive advantage. This was also the time when the jet engine manufacturers, GE and Pratt & Whitney (and a number of third- party \\"packagers\\") entered the market with their packaged units. These proved to be very quick to install and highly efficient, and gained a lot of attention. (Efficiency was not as important as price since only intermittent use was planned for them.) The key to lowering $/kW was to increase engine power rating. This was achieved in two ways: First, be able to offer a larger unit than the competition (and with the W501 Westinghouse did just that and was able to make up for its relatively low volume vs. GE). Then, once the basic frame size is set, incremental rating growth can be achieved by increasing turbine firing temperature (i.e., \\"turning up the wick\\"). = Evolution of the W501 model series = Following the introduction of the W501A in 1967/68, Westinghouse technology quickly continued to evolve as turbine inlet temperatures increased by means of improved internal cooling and advanced metallurgy, and pressure ratios increased with improved compressor designs. Over the period from 1968 to 1975, the W501 progressed from the W501A (~40 MW), W501AA (~60 MW), W501B (~80 MW) and the W501D (~95 MW). The next major redesign was the W501D5, introduced in 1981, initially at a rating of 96.5 MW (growing to 107 MW (gross) ca. 1985). In 1995, the W501D5A upgrade was offered with a rating of 120 MW. In the late-1980 and early-1990s, Westinghouse introduced the advanced 501F, initially rated at 150 MW (nominal). The first commercial start-up date for the 501F was in 1993 (four units, installed at the Florida Power & Light Lauderdale Station repowering project). A similar technology evolution path was followed for the smaller geared model W251 (see referenced ASME paper by Scalzo, et al.) shows how that model actually led the way to some of the technology steps taken in the evolution of the W501. (See Scalzo, et al. for tables showing evolution of both the Westinghouse model W501 and W251 gas turbines.). Note progression in turbine rotor inlet temperature and number of cooled rows (turbine vanes and blades). The W501A was immediately preceded by the W301, the first direct- drive design. The upgrade involved adding two stages to the compressor (one fore and one aft) and a new turbine design with a cooled first-stage vane. Ed. Note: At the same 1994 ASME Gas Turbine Conference where the above-referenced ASME paper by Scalzo, et al. was presented, Westinghouse also delivered a paper announcing plans to develop a 250 MW-class gas turbine, the 501G. To be designed by the Westinghouse/MHI/FiatAvio alliance, (MHI, a long-time licensee, had also collaborated with and funded Westinghouse in the development of the 501F) the design featured a steam-cooled transition duct, another of many industry firsts for Westinghouse (see Appendix I). The first 501G was installed at Lakeland Electric's McIntosh station and was first synchronized to the grid in April, 1999. = The W251 model series evolves along with W501 = As mentioned above, the W251 model series followed an evolutionary path from the venerable W191 (ranging from 15 MW to around 18 MW over product life, with more than 180 units sold) and was introduced in 1967, just prior to the W501. The W251A, at a nominal rating of 20 MW, was the first to feature cooling of first-stage turbine vane and other stationary parts. In 1985, when the W251B10 was rated at approximately 45 MW, the W251 product line charter was moved to Westinghouse Canada. The W251, at half the rating of the W501, was popular for smaller applications, and about 230 units were sold. The final design before being dropped from the product line ca. 1998, the W251B12 was a 50 MW class gas turbine, built at Westinghouse Hamilton, Ont. plant. With gear driven generator, the W251 could be used in 50 Hz as well as 60 Hz applications.  Westinghouse gas turbine engine design features  From the earliest of its heavy-duty gas turbine designs, Westinghouse has retained time proven mechanical design features that have endured for more than 50 years and have been emulated by other manufacturers. This page from early (ca. 1990) Westinghouse sales documents for the 501F provides a list of these features. Note the cold-end generator drive feature, original with Westinghouse and later adopted by others (including the industry leader in its own F-class design). This is ideal for heat recovery applications and avoids the need for a high-temperature flexible drive coupling in the exhaust end (characteristic of earlier designs of others). Also, the two-bearing rotor design avoided the need for a high-temperature center bearing buried in the hot section of the engine (also characteristic of earlier designs of others). Not mentioned on the list is the patented tangential exhaust casing struts designed to maintain rotor alignment.  Westinghouse packaged gas turbine power plants  Westinghouse pioneered in the development of pre-engineered packaged gas turbine generator power plants, both with the EconoPac, a complete modularized simple cycle package, and with the PACE combined cycle plant. = The Westinghouse EconoPac packaged GT power plant = Note: \\"EconoPac\\" is a registered Trademark of Siemens Energy Corp. As the gas turbine engine technology evolved, so did ideas on how to best package all of it auxiliary supporting systems. In addition to the gas turbine itself, the scope of supply included the generator/exciter, a starting motor, the mechanical and electrical auxiliaries, and the inlet and exhaust systems. In 1962 Westinghouse introduced the concept of a pre-engineered packaged gas-turbine power generating unit with the W171 (12,000 kW) unit sold to the City of Houma Light & Power Co. (LA). This early application established the basis for the \\"EconoPac\\" simple cycle packaged plant which became the standard scope of supply for Westinghouse simple cycle gas turbine units to this day. The Westinghouse \\"EconoPac\\"includes the factory-assembled skid-mounted gas turbine engine, generator and exciter, starting package, mechanical (lube oil, hydraulics, pneumatics, etc.)and electrical/control auxiliary skids, inlet system (filter and ducting), exhaust system (ducting, stack and silencer), all coolers, fans, pumps, valves, and interconnecting piping. Enclosures for all skids are also included in the standard scope of supply. Typically, the EconoPac defined the gas turbine scope of supply for extended scope plants (cogeneration, combined cycle, etc.) as well as a simple cycle unit. Photo of model of W501D5 EconoPac illustrates major components and arrangement.Full gas turbine power plant would arrive at site in pre-packaged modules for quick field assembly. The glycol cooler was used for hydrogen-cooled generator,which was standard scope before availability of large air-cooled generators for the application. Air-to-air cooler next to exhaust stack is for cooling of rotor cooling air, a feature of Westinghouse gas turbine packages. = Westinghouse PACE Combined Cycle Power Plants = As in the case of the simple cycle gas turbine pre-engineered and packaged plant, Westinghouse also pioneered with the idea of a pre-engineered combined cycle plant. Around 1970, a design group was organized under the leadership of Paul Berman, Manager PACE Engineering, and the Marketing and Sales team went into high gear with an all-out promotion campaign. A thermal cycle concept was developed around the use of two 75 MW W501B gas turbines and a new 100 MW single case steam turbine specifically designed for the application. The plant was called the PACE Plant (for Power At Combined Efficiencies) and the first design was dubbed the PACE 260 to reflect the nominal power rating of the plant. The PACE design was geared towards the \\"intermediate load\\" market (between peaking and base load) where there was a growing need to install capacity that was more economical to install than base load (coal and nuclear plants) and more economical to operate than simple cycle gas turbines. The equipment had to also be flexible enough to be able to withstand the stresses of daily start-and-stop operating duty. Special provisions were made throughout the design to accommodate this cycling mode of operation. The PACE 260 concept (and later the upgraded PACE 320) was captured in this image depicting the thermodynamic cycle behind the plant design. As can be seen the original concept included supplemental (duct) firing of the two-pressure heat recover boilers, which were a vertical flow design configuration. The basic configuration was described as a 2-on-1 design, meaning that two gas turbines produced steam to feed one steam turbine. Supplemental firing was utilized to increase steam production so as to fill the 100 MW single-case steam turbine. In the initial design, approximately 20% of the fuel input was fired in the duct burner. Without supplemental firing, there is typically adequate energy in the exhaust of the gas turbine to generate enough steam to produce about 50% of the gas turbine power, or, in this case, only 75 MW. In this way, the original PACE plant design had built-in steam turbine capacity to enable the water/steam side of the plant to remain essentially the same as the gas turbine power rating evolved through to the 100 MW-plus W501D5, when the rating of the plant was 300 MW without supplemental firing. The PACE 260 was initially offered with a heat rate of about 8,100 Btu/kWh (42% efficiency) LHV on natural gas fuel. The upgraded (ca. 1980) PACE 320 based on the W501D, had a nominal 300 MW rating and a heat rate of 7,530 Btu/kWh (45% efficiency) LHV on natural gas fuel. PACE plants were available either with full-enclosure buildings to cover all but the heat recovery boilers, or for outdoor installation, with the EconoPacs providing the necessary enclosures for the gas turbines and their auxiliaries. For the early PACE plants Westinghouse designed and manufactured the heat recovery boilers at the Heat Transfer Division in Lester. Later plants incorporated heat recovery units supplied by subcontractors. An installation list of PACE plants shows units sold and installed as of the mid-1980s. Note that several of the installations included two PACE 260 plants (mirror image plant designs were available for those cases). These were called PACE 520 plants. It is also noted that nearly half of the plants were built in Mexico, one PACE 260 and two PACE 520s. The first PACE 260 was installed at the Public Service Co. of Oklahoma‚Äôs Comanche station, in Lawton, OK, entering commercial in 1973. Based on published information, time from commitment to the design program (Jan. 1970) to commercial operation was less than three years. Reference is made to ASME paper 74-GT-109, by Paul A. Berman, Westinghouse Manager of PACE Engineering, which describes the PACE concept in detail and documents the construction and start-up of the Comanche plant. Since its installation, some 40 years ago, the plant went through major boiler modification (seen in photo below), several engine performance upgrades and has operated for many years as the most economical plant on PSO's system. (This writer recalls being told that the initial price for natural gas at the site was $0.26 per million Btu!) As of this writing, the plant is still in use, albeit not for continuous duty. The three early PACE plants sold to CFE (PACE 260 at Palacio Gomez and PACE 520 at Dos Bocas) involved an order for six (6) W501B gas turbines and represented the largest order placed by CFE up to that time. The story has it that the order was received on a Good Friday (ca. 1973?) after a very contentious competition with another major US supplier who used some rather \\"creative\\" ways to enhance plant performance. Everyone involved in the negotiation was anxious to get home for Easter, but not so anxious that they left before getting the order. The final plant on the list was built for CFE at Tula, Mexico, as a phased-construction project, where the four (4) W501D EconoPac units were shipped and installed on an ASAP basis,in simple cycle mode, to meet an energy emergency during 1979-1981. The HRSGs and steam turbine portion of each plant was added later and the exhaust stacks were removed. (Photo below is of artist's concept of converted plant. The four W501D EonoPacs were already in place at time of photo.) The rise of US cogeneration and independent power markets  As shown earlier the U.S. market for gas turbines enjoyed a substantial boom for simple cycle peaking units following the Northeast Blackout of 1965. And that, in turn, led to the advent, around 1970, of the popular pre-engineered combined cycle plant, such as the Westinghouse PACE and GE STAG (STeam And Gas) plants which enjoyed much early success in the early 1970s. There was much promise sustained growth in the gas turbine business. The breakout of the Arab-Israeli war of 1973 changed all of that. Following the war, Arab members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) imposed an embargo against the United States, and other countries in Europe and South Africa, in retaliation for the U.S. decision to re-supply the Israeli military. The almost immediate result of the embargo was severe shortages in target countries such as the US, and a steep rise in the global price, of oil and oil products. The U.S. had become increasingly dependent on imported oil and the embargo caused a major disruption of the national economy. First the Nixon administration, then the short-lived administration of Gerald Ford, and, finally, that of Jimmy Carter, all developed plans to increase domestic production and reduce the use of imported oil. At the same time, during the Jimmy Carter administration, there was a strong concerted move in the natural gas industry for deregulation, and a supply shortage of pipeline gas was created to punctuate their position. A direct result of all of this tumult in the energy supply chain was Jimmy Carter's National Energy Plan of 1977 and a declaration of Energy Independence. Legislation was introduced in the U.S. Congress aimed at establishing strict prohibitions and regulations aimed at achieving reductions in the use of both imported oil and natural gas. (This was written at time when there was a glut of both oil and natural gas in the U.S.) At the time there was clearly a strong pro-coal leaning in Congress, and coal, as the most abundant domestic energy source in the US, was being promoted as offering the way to achieve independence from imported oil. \\"King Coal\\" was in the driver's seat, and the future of coal-fired power generation seemed assured in spite of the environmental laws and regulations that had been passed only a few years earlier. After months and months of debate (much which this writer witnessed in person) the National Energy Act of 1978 was passed and proudly signed into law by Jimmy Carter. Two of the major provisions of the new energy legislation had profound impacts on the gas turbine industry: ¬∑ First, The Fuel Use Act (FUA), which, among other things, prohibited the use of oil and natural gas as fuel for new base load power plants. Only \\"alternative fuels\\" ‚Äì i.e., coal and coal-derived fuels ‚Äì were allowed for that purpose. (Again, in today's environment, can anyone imagine ??). Peaking units and intermediate-load combined cycle power plants (<3500 hours per year operation) were exempt from the prohibitions of the Fuel Use Act, as were \\"cogeneration facilities\\". ¬∑ Second, The Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA), which had a lot to do with the deregulation of the electric utility industry and, among other things, established rules requiring electric utilities to purchase power from non-utility generators (\\"NUG\\"). Such NUGs, however, also had to deliver some amount of thermal energy to an industrial process plant, i.e. the generating unit had to be \\"qualified\\" as a cogeneration facility. Thereby, such a facility was defined as a qualifying facility or \\"QF\\". These new energy laws were about to have great impact on the U.S. gas turbine market. Since this editor was designated as the Westinghouse GTSD's (a.k.a. CTSD's) \\"Man in Washington\\" at the time, there are some observations from personal experience that can be contributed to this aspect of the history of Westinghouse gas turbines. = A tale of two companies = It was noted that both the FUA and PURPA legislation granted special privileges to owners of cogeneration facilities, or \\"QFs\\". This would indicate that some rather well planned and coordinated approach to legislative engineering (i.e. lobbying) went into the crafting of both new laws as they evolved, in parallel, through Congress. Although Westinghouse did its share of work attempting to reduce the negative aspects of the Fuel Use Act, this positive aspect of the legislation is not something for which Westinghouse may claim credit. The General Electric Company, on the other hand, apparently found a way to work with the Congressional staffs on both pieces of legislation to help them draft a set of energy legislation and regulations to be as favorable to gas turbines as possible. Cogeneration became a DC buzzword after President Carter spoke about it in one of his energy policy speeches, and it could very well be imagined that he was fed information for that speech by GE. The wide difference between GE and Westinghouse, when it came to their views and actions regarding the energy legislation of 1978, and the future of gas turbines, was glaring. Westinghouse upper management apparently had its main focus on the Fuel Use Act, and saw it as a death sentence to the long-term future of gas turbines. At the same time, the law was seen as confirmation of a solid future for large coal-fired and nuclear steam plants and, indirectly, for large steam turbine generators. In fact, in 1979, the prohibition on the use of natural gas under the FUA even led Westinghouse to rename the product to combustion turbines, and the Gas Turbine Systems Division (GTSD) was renamed Combustion Turbine Systems Division (CTSD). It was as if removing the word \\"gas\\" from the product name would change its stature under the law. (It may be that EPRI, the Electric Power Research Institute, may have had something to do with this change in name as well.) Meanwhile, is known from personal observation that GE spent most of their lobbying effort on the formulation of the PURPA rules related to Qualifying Facilities and, most likely, on the cogeneration exemption to the Fuel Use Act as well. While this editor attended many Congressional hearings on the FUA, in order to understand, and lessen, the extent of the negative impact on gas turbines, GE representatives were seen at concurrent hearings on PURPA, to make sure that GE's (apparent) plan to create a new cogeneration / IPP market for gas turbines was taking form. Soon after the National Energy Act was signed into law, GE was quick to announce formation of a new Cogeneration Projects Department. Its purpose was to pursue new market opportunities made possible by PURPA. Their approach was to assist a new breed of project developer entrepreneurs to exploit the new vulnerability of electric utilities (under PURPA). GE helped developers to find good project sites close to fuel supply and transmission lines, assisted them in the application of GE equipment for cogeneration, and supported their proposals of Power Purchase Agreements (\\"PPA\\") to the local utilities. While Westinghouse was concerned that promoting cogeneration and working with NUG or Independent Power Producer (IPP) entrepreneurs would upset its traditional utility customer base, GE aggressively pursued the growing number of IPP developers, and helped them to navigate the new territory opened to them by PURPA. And this stark difference between the two power generation giants was not lost on industry observers. This editor recalls an issue of The Energy Daily, a DC-based energy newsletter, where the publisher (Llewellyn King, currently publisher of White House Chronicle) devoted the front-page to highlighting this unusually wide difference between GE and Westinghouse in how each viewed the future of the power generation industry. (The editor has contacted Mr. King in an attempt to obtain a copy of that issue.) = New markets slow to grow = As shown in US Combustion Turbine Market curve above, the years immediately following the passage the FUA and PURPA saw little new domestic business for gas turbines as much legal wrangling was taken place around the country. In fact, 1982 was probably the worst year ever in terms of orders placed for large gas turbines in the US. The prototype W501D5 was sold to Gulf States Utilities in 1981 and two other W501D5 EconoPacs were sold to Puget Sound Power & Light Co. Dow Chemical, whose expanding on-site power industrial generation facilities in Texas and Louisiana were not affected by the new laws, purchased several units in 1980/‚Äô81. That was about it for new unit sales for Westinghouse CTSD until 1983. The IPP market was awaiting the outcome of government legal action as several state Public Utility Commissions refused to implement the PURPA regulations, claiming that they were unconstitutional. It wasn‚Äôt until 1982, in FERC v. Mississippi PUC, when the Supreme Court decided in favor of the Federal Energy Regulatory Administration (FERC) and upheld the law. This turned out to be the catalyst that finally enabled the IPP market take off and realize a lot of pent-up potential. And, almost as an immediate result, Westinghouse CTSD participated in two important early IPP cogeneration projects that helped to bridge the gap and, once again, allowed us to survive the drought in domestic utility orders. = Capital Cogeneration = In 1983, H.B. Zachry Co. of San Antonio obtained a contract from Capital Cogeneration Company Ltd (a joint venture, including Central and Southwest Power Co., to design and build a 450 MW combined cycle/cogeneration plant near Bayport (a.k.a. Pasadena), Texas, south of Houston. This was one of the earliest \\"PURPA Plants\\" to be built in the U.S. under the new PURPA regulations. Westinghouse CTSD obtained the order from H.B. Zachry Co. for 3xW501D5 EconoPacs for integration into the combined cycle plant (HRSGs supplied by Henry Vogt Co.) The plant exported power for sale to Houston Power and Light and steam to a nearby process plant owned by Celanese Chemical (the \\"steam host\\"). Thanks to excellent field sales relationship with Zachry and CSW, this plant was essentially an all-Westinghouse plant, including the 150 MW-class steam turbine generator and all power electrics. Today the plant is known as Clear Lake Cogeneration, and is owned by Calpine. = Texas City Cogeneration = The second major IPP project in which Westinghouse CTSD participated was developed ca. 1985 by Internorth Natural Gas of Omaha, NE. The plant location, Texas City, TX, is about 35 miles southeast of the Capital Cogeneration project site, above. Internorth's concept was to use PURPA IPP cogeneration QF rules to build a 400 MW cogeneration plant that would sell the power to Houston Power and Light and export steam to a nearby Dow Chemical (then Union Carbide) plant. At the same time, the plant, which would be exempt from the FUA, would be an excellent new power generation customer for Internorth's fuel gas. With little other business available, a determined Marketing effort at CTSD was intensely focused on this negotiation. Since this was taking place at the same time as a serious 4th stage turbine blade design issue with the W501D5, an engineering team led by CT Engine Engineering Manager, Augie Scalzo, was also assigned to satisfy Internorth that the design was sound. Westinghouse did obtain the order for 3xW501D5 EconoPacs to be installed at the plant called Texas City Cogeneration. The three units included the last W501D5 built at the Lester factory before it was closed in 1986 and the first two engines built by MHI under a new business arrangement with the long-time Westinghouse licensee. Shortly after the Texas City plant was built, Internorth merged with Houston Natural Gas, and moved its headquarters to Houston. Shortly after that, the joint company changed its name to ENRON (but that's a whole story unto itself). Today, the Texas City Plant is owned by Calpine. Other early PURPA-plant projects in which Westinghouse CTSD participated are described later as part of the story of the relocation of CTSD to Orlando, FL. = Dow/Destec IGCC at Plaquemine, LA = As might be imagined, the idea of burning coal, or some derivative of it ‚Äì be it liquid or gas ‚Äì in a gas turbine gained considerable attention and government support during the late 1970s and into the 1980s. \\"Synthetic\\" gas or liquid fuels made from coal were considered \\"alternative fuels\\", encouraged under the Fuel Use Act, and the development of various such fuels was being heavily supported by the US Department of Energy. In fact, Westinghouse was already working under government contract to develop its own coal gasification process. A process development unit was built at Waltz Mill, PA and operated by the Westinghouse R&D; Center. To show its commitment to commercialization of the technology, Westinghouse even formed the Synthetic Fuels Division (ca. 1983). (SFD, as it was called, was later disbanded around 1987, as the DOE contract expired, and the rights to the process were sold to Kellogg-Rust Engineering. The gasification process became known as the KRW process and was continued to be marketed by KRW Inc.) In the meantime, Dow Chemical was looking into how it might utilize large lignite deposits in Texas to reduce its dependence on natural gas to fuel its vast on-site power generating facilities. Not that its on-site power operations were necessarily impacted by the Fuel Use Act, but it seemed like a good hedge just in case the natural gas shortage turned out to be the real thing. To implement this back-up energy strategy, Dow undertook development of its own coal gasification process (later to be called \\"E-Gas\\") and pursued government support from the Synthetic Fuels Corporation, established in 1980 for the purpose of nurturing a synthetic fuel (i.e. coal-derived gas or liquid) industry in the U.S. as part of \\"Project Independence\\". In the meantime, Dow and Westinghouse engineers worked toward converting the two new W501D5 gas turbines that were installed at the Dow Plaquemine, LA complex in 1982/83. As a first step, in 1981, they undertook on the conversion of an old W191 located at the Dow, Freeport, Tx complex to burn low-BTU (approx. 200 Btu/scf vs. 1000 Btu/scf for natural gas.) This gas was to be produced by a protype proprietary gasifier being designed and built by Dow. They specified that the gas turbine was to be modified to be able to supply compressed air for the gasification process, and it also had to operate on natural gas (at least for startup and shut down). The 15 MW demonstration was successful and the full-scale program went ahead. Dow proceeded to build a full-scale oxygen-blown gasifier sized to supply the two W501D5s at Plaquemine, LA with 80% of their fuel energy, and Westinghouse was given the go-ahead to design and manufacture the new fuel nozzles. Since the gas turbines were an integral part of existing plant operations, the specification was to assure dual-fuel capability, so that the unit could easily revert to natural gas when the gasifier was not in operation. Fortunately, Westinghouse CTSD combustion engineers had earlier worked under subcontract on the above-mentioned DOE coal gasification contract to demonstrate low-Btu gas combustion on W501B components. Later, that work led to the design of W501D5 combustor baskets to incorporate features (e.g., a larger-diameter head end) to make them adaptable to use of low-Btu fuel gas. So the Plaquemine units were essentially \\"syngas ready\\", and were readily modified. The conversion of the two 100 MW+ gas turbines at Plaquemine to burn gasified coal created the largest integrated-gasification combined cycle or \\"IGCC\\", in the world, and was very successful for Dow. The Dow (or more accuratleyLGTI - Louisiana Gasification Technology, Inc.) Synfuels Corporation contract continued to subsidize the production of synthetic fuel gas from coal at the Plaquemine site for about 10‚Äì15 years before the subsidy expired. Later Dow (or actually Destec Energy) was able to participate in the DOE-supported repowering of the Public Service of Indiana Wabash power station with an advanced F-class gas turbine burning gas produced by an \\"E-Gas\\" gasifier. Unfortunately, Westinghouse did not get the order for the gas turbine from Public Service Co. of Indiana, and the project used a GE Frame 7F. Today the Wabash gasification system is operating on a commercial basis, selling coal- derived gas to the 250 MW Wabash combined cycle power plant. Needless to say, Dow never implemented conversion of their own power generating facilities at any of their Gulf Coast locations. Natural gas remained plentiful, and, in recent years, has become a cheaper fuel than it was 30 years ago.  The Concordville years (1979‚Äì1987)  From around 1972 through 1979, the headquarters of Gas Turbine Division (a.k.a. Gas Turbine Systems Division and Combustion Turbine Systems Division), had been located in rented space in the renovated Baldwin-Lima-Hamilton Building (vintage 1920s) in Eddystone, PA, just south of the Westinghouse Lester factory. The gas turbine division operations occupied the top 4 floors of the 7-floor office building (known as The \\"A\\" Building), while the rest of the building was occupied by Westinghouse Steam Turbine Engineering and other support groups. As noted earlier, these years at \\"A-Building\\" as the BLH building became known, saw many ups and downs for Westinghouse gas turbines. Around 1977, just as the U.S. market for new units was drying up (but the Saudi market had just peaked, see later) it was decided that CTSD should have a new headquarters building of its own, and a new world-class gas turbine development lab. Ground breaking for new CTSD headquarters took place in 1977/78 and the facility was fully occupied by the summer of 1979. (Bob Kirby, then Chairman and CEO, attended a dedication ceremony at the site in June, 1978.) The selected site was at Concordville, PA, about 15 miles northwest of the Lester plant. The headquarters for Westinghouse Electric's Combustion Turbine Systems Division (CTSD) in Concordville, Pennsylvania. The world-class development laboratory at left background featured rigs for component testing at engine operating conditions, including large indirectly fired air preheater to provide heated non-vitiated (i.e., full O2 content) air for combustion testing. For 8 years, 1979-1987, the Concordville site was where CTSD ran its business, serving both domestic and international markets, conducted significant R&D; with both internal and external funding (from EPRI, DOE and NASA), developed improved engine and plant designs, managed numerous projects and, perhaps most importantly for long-term survival, grew its service business as the most profitable part of its operation. = The Ready Source of Power = Around the time of the move to Concordville, CTSD also launched its \\"Westinghouse Combustion Turbines The Ready Source of Power\\" campaign which highlighted the newly introduced W501D5 gas turbine, advances in technology, such as the ability to burn coal-derived gas and liquid fuels, and the importance of planned maintenance on achieving high reliability and availability of gas turbine plants. In fact, by the mid-1980s all of Westinghouse Power Generation took on a strategic refocusing of its business from the traditional emphasis on new unit applications to aggressive development of the service sector. Although \\"growing the fleet\\" was still an essential ingredient to the growth of the gas turbine service business, the lack of new-unit opportunities at the time dictated at least a temporary shift in emphasis. CTSD developed the \\"Total Service\\" program, promoting capabilities in outage management and availability improvement programs. \\"Total Service ‚Äì More Than Just Parts\\" became the mantra. (This writer recalls the National Sales Meeting in Orlando ca. 1983, prior to completion of the new office building at the Quadrangle, and the theme of the meeting was \\"We‚Äôre in the Service Now\\". The entire Steam Turbine Generator Marketing operation was reorganized around the operating plant market.) Note that the Development Center (commonly referred to as \\"The Lab\\") was completed in 1976, while CTSD was still located in at A-Building, Eddystone. According to a Westinghouse brochure, \\"The Lab\\" was capable of full-scale testing of compressor, combustor, turbine, and auxiliary system components over the entire range of operating conditions (exhaust system designs were developed at reduced scale). The lab included a high-bay area that could accommodate a full-size gas turbine for testing and development purposes, as well as a large conference room and offices for the managers, engineers and technicians who operated the facility. It was sized to enable full-scale combustion testing, which required a large, a jet-derived gas turbine driven air compressor. It also required a gas-fired heater to simulate combustor inlet conditions. CTSD operations at Concordville grew and ebbed over the near decade of The Concordville Years. At one point (ca 1981/82 per CTSD employee telephone directory), CTSD employment reached a peak level of around 600 people. But financial performance did not support such growth, and there was a major downsizing in the 1985-1987 time frame prior to the relocation to Orlando to be incorporated at Westinghouse Power Generation World Headquarters. Only about 100 CTSD professionals and management remained at the time to make the trip south in the spring of 1987. = Changes in Westinghouse - MHI Relationship = (Note: This section is based primarily on personal recollections of one of the key engineers involved in the episode.) A significant development that took place near the close of the Concordville years involved a major change in the relationship between Westinghouse CTSD and its long-time licensee, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI). Many credit this development as a key event in Westinghouse's long term survival (and MHI's?) as a major participant in the gas turbine industry, and the key to the Siemens acquisition of the business ten years later. By the mid-1980s, it had already been decided that gas turbine manufacturing operations at the Lester, PA plant would cease by the end of 1986, and, also, that manufacturing of the popular W501D5 engines would be outsourced from the MHI plant in Takasago, Japan. This plan enabled CTSD to put into place at least a temporary means of continuing doing business - to obtain and fulfill orders for large gas turbines as the US cogeneration and IPP markets were developing. (As noted earlier, the first MHI-built engines were installed at the Texas City Cogen plant. According to internal records, the total number of W501D5s purchased by Westinghouse from MHI was 10, as were the first four 501F engines, below.) The next development in the Westinghouse-MHI relationship came in 1986 when MHI shared a study that indicated that the global market for its 50-Hz scaled version the Westinghouse gas turbines (called the MW701D) would soon see a strong return, and they proposed the joint development of a new advanced 50 Hz engine to be called the \\"701F\\". (GE was already developing its Frame 7F.) The 60 Hz design for the markets served by Westinghouse would follow. Since Westinghouse corporate support of advanced gas turbine development and design at that time was nil, Westinghouse agreed to supply key engine design engineering support (as specified by MHI) and MHI provided the funding to support the effort, as well as to manufacture the prototype engine. Joint conceptual design started in mid-1986 and, somewhere early in the effort, it was decided that the first engine should be the 60 Hz \\"501F\\" version of the design. (MHI would subsequently complete the scaling process for the 50 Hz design.) The new design provided both companies with the opportunity to incorporate some important design improvements and attributes that were not feasible to be back-engineered into existing W501D5/MW701D designs, but could readily be introduced into a new design. Despite the reduction in work force at Westinghouse and the interruption caused by preparation for the move of the Combustion Turbine Operations to Orlando (announced in October, 1986) work progressed steadily on the new engine design. Westinghouse had agreed to take on about sixty percent of the design effort on the new engine, and the work effort continued with the actual move of the engine engineering staff in April, 1987 to Orlando. .Although many employees decided, for one reason or another, including many taking early retirement, to not make the move south, the joint development program with MHI greatly benefited from the decision of several of key engineers who agreed to delay their retirement, temporarily, move to Florida and continue to work on the program. The joint design effort continued through June 1988 with major design reviews being held quarterly. Meeting sites for these reviews alternated between Orlando and Takasago, Japan. From start to finish, the total design effort spanned just 23 months and was completed on schedule. Based on the circumstances such as the move from Concordville, loss of key employees, cultural differences, language barriers and the distant site logistics, the project was considered to be an excellent example of engineering and management teamwork and a significant accomplishment for both Westinghouse and MHI. The 501F program permanently changed the relationship between the two companies, giving each independent and royalty-free manufacturing and marketing rights to the new engine. The prototype 501F engine was built and shop-tested at MHI's turbine factory and development center at Takasago in mid-1989. In 1990, Westinghouse secured an order for the first four 501F units, built in Takasago, from Florida Power and Light Co. for their Lauderdale Station Repowering project, which started operation in mid-1993. The contracted ISO rating of those units was 158 MW. Essentially coincident with the start-up of the FP&L; Lauderdale plant, Westinghouse announced to MHI that they would start development and production of an up-rated 501F, the 167 MW \\"FB\\", which resulted in another joint effort between Westinghouse and MHI. Again both parties put teams in place and the up-rated design was accomplished as scheduled. The first Westinghouse-built 501F was shipped from the Pensacola plant in October, 1995 for the Korea Electric Power Co. (KEPCO) project in Ulsan, Korea. At about the same time, Westinghouse and MHI were well on their way toward the joint development of the steam-cooled 250 MW-class 501G engine. See below.  Westinghouse gas turbines - Orlando bound  The physical move south by Westinghouse Power Generation started in 1982 and initially was done to consolidate the non- manufacturing operations of the Steam Turbine Division located in the Philadelphia, PA area and the Large Rotating Apparatus Division (i.e. generators) located in the Pittsburgh, PA area. The selection of Orlando, FL as the new home for the Steam Turbine Generator Division came after a process of elimination of several other \\"neutral\\" locations. The story has it that Richmond, VA had been the first choice for the new Westinghouse Power Generation headquarters, but the ongoing legal issues between Westinghouse and a major Virginia-based utility over nuclear fuel contracts but a damper on that idea. Westinghouse purchased a large tract of land called The Quadrangle located just across the road from the sprawling campus of what is now called the University of Central Florida and built a large new office building. Prior to moving into the new building, the Steam Turbine Generator Division headquarters was located in an abandoned shopping center. = On the move............... = In October, 1986 the long expected notice was received by employees: CTSD (a.k.a. CTO - Combustion Turbine Operations) would be moving to Orlando to join the Steam Turbine Generator Division (STGD) operation which had moved south from Lester and E. Pittsburgh 4‚Äì5 years earlier. The actual move took place in April, 1987 when all of those making the move were to report to work at their new location at The Quadrangle, Orlando, Florida. Prior to the move, early in 1986, the newly formed Power Systems Business Unit management team, headquartered at the Energy Center in Monroeville, PA, and now in charge of Power Generation (as well as the Nuclear Energy segment), had formed a Power Generation Task Force. The objective was to better understand the future of the power generation industry, and how Westinghouse could best position itself to grow and prosper in it. A renowned industry consultant was hired to conduct a market study, and it was then, finally, that the importance of gas-turbines to the future of power generation in the U.S. ‚Äì if not worldwide ‚Äì became appreciated. As indicated earlier, this had not been the general view of the old-guard power generation management, and Westinghouse had already started to execute its plan commonly known as \\"phased exit\\" from the gas turbine business. The small group (under 100) that moved with CTO quickly grew through \\"Project Backfill\\". A substantial number of STGD engineers and managers, as well as many professionals and managers from nuclear projects and engineering operations, and, also, personnel from Westinghouse Canada, found new career opportunities in rebuilding the organization. After moving to Orlando in 1987, CTO was incorporated into the Generation Technology Systems Division (GTSD). But his organization proved to be short-lived as Westinghouse Power Systems formed the Power Generation Business Unit, in 1988. Just after the move, a promotional brochure was produced called: \\"On the Move\\", aimed at assuring customers, the rest of the industry, and employees, that Westinghouse was still in the gas turbine business. It also told of another recent big change, i.e., reaching agreement with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI), a long-time Westinghouse licensee, to manufacture the W501D5. (While the W251 was still to be built at Westinghouse Canada, Hamilton works, the Lester plant closed in 1986.) According to the announcement in the brochure, Westinghouse CTO was to continue in the role of technology developers, system and plant designers, application engineers, marketers, project managers and service providers. As it turned out, depending on MHI for shop space to supply Westinghouse's market needs did not work out very well, nor did it continue for very long. In 1991, PGBU management saw fit to end the agreement with MHI and to resurrect the Great North American Factory by using the Pensacola, FL plant for assembly of the W501D5. Other Westinghouse plants involved in the manufacture of Westinghouse gas turbines included those in Charlotte, NC, Hamilton, Ont., and Winston-Salem, NC. = Take A New Look At Westinghouse Combustion Turbines = Another big part of the advertising campaign following the move to Orlando was the theme: \\"Take a new look‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.at Westinghouse Combustion Turbines\\". The message was clear. The marketplace had to be reassured that \\"engineering excellence and proven technology\\" along with \\"full customer service\\" were ongoing constants with Westinghouse, in spite of the major changes that had taken place. Another new marketing theme: \\"Westinghouse ‚Äì the _new value_ in combustion turbines.\\" It was apparently felt necessary by Westinghouse, in 1988 ‚Äì- 40 years after the first Westinghouse industrial gas turbine was placed in operation and after a long history of industry firsts and solid accomplishments‚Äîthe new management team in Orlando went to all the industry media with the message to let the world know that Westinghouse was still around with a new commitment to its gas turbine business.. = Bellingham and Sayreville: major cogen project milestones = Within a year after the move to Orlando, two additional major orders for-cogeneration projects were obtained to help restore Westinghouse's position in the marketplace. Two identical PACE 300 (2-W501D5 GT on 1-100 MW ST) power plants were ordered by Intercontinental Energy Corp., a family-owned private-power IPP development company located in Massachusetts. These were the Bellingham (MA) and Sayreville (NJ) cogeneration projects, and they were instrumental in restoring confidence in Westinghouse's gas turbine business - to the outside world, to the new management of the Power Generation Business Unit, and to CTO employees. From editor's personal recollection, the prime competition for the Bellingham and Sayreville project orders, after the customer had already broken off discussions with GE, was Fluor-Daniel Corp., which was offering Siemens/KWU V84.2 100 MW gas turbines. In addition to some very effective negotiating skills on the part of Westinghouse, KWU's relative lack of 60 Hz experience was rumored to be a strong factor in the customer's decision to go with Westinghouse. The Bellingham and Sayreville projects were developed under the rules of the PURPA energy legislation of 1978. In the case of the Bellingham plant, the developer achieved Qualifying Facility (\\"QF\\") status in a unique way by supplying a slip stream of exhaust gas to feed an adjoining process unit for production of beverage-grade CO2 sold to a nearby soda bottling plant. For the Sayreville project, the owners found a more conventional means to achieve QF status by exporting steam for process use at a nearby chemical plant. Today both the Bellingham and Sayreville \\"Energy Centers\\" are owned by NextEra Energy Resources, Both the Bellingham and Sayreville plants were supplied by Westinghouse PGBU under turnkey contracts, as was another important milestone cogeneration combined cycle plant built around the same timeframe in New Jersey, the approximately 150 MW Newark Bay Cogeneration facility, which uses two 46.5 MW W251B10 gas turbine units. = Introduction of the 501F Advanced Gas Turbine = As noted earlier work by Westinghouse CTO on the advanced 150 MW-class 501F started in Concordville two years before the move to Orlando. This new engine was being co-developed with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI), a decades-long Westinghouse licensee, acting in a new role as design partner, investing in the development, and working alongside Westinghouse engineers. The design target was a 2300F (1260C) rotor inlet temperature, with a mature rating expected to be around 160 MW. The introductory rating was set at 145 MW with simple cycle heat rate of 10,000 Btu/kwh or 34% efficiency. The combined cycle efficiency being advertised at the time was \\"better than 50%\\". Although the 501F had many design changes and improvements to achieve higher firing temperature and better reliability, its family DNA is clearly rooted in the W501, as is evident from the list of design features cited earlier. (Note the use 501F vs. W501F, in deference to MHI, which to this day uses the Westinghouse model nomenclature for its large gas turbine products). The prototype 501F engine was built by MHI at its Takasago manufacturing and testing facilities. In mid-1989 it was reported in the press that the prototype unit would be undergoing full-load factory testing. The first 501F gas turbines (4 of them) were sold to Florida Power & Light Co. for the Lauderdale Station repowering project, and went into service in 1993. This was the first of several large repowering projects undertaken by the Florida utility, most of which used Westinghouse gas turbines (or Siemens gas turbines, following the Siemens acquisition of Westinghouse PGBU in 1998, below.) As noted earlier, the introductory rating of the 501F in 1988 was 145 MW, when it was said that the mature rating would exceed 150 MW. As shown in the adjoining curve, the growth of the Westinghouse \\"F\\" machine over the decade 1988-1998 greatly exceeded original expectations The curve plots 501F combined cycle efficiency vs. time, with simple cycle power rating and heat rate shown at intervals along the development timeline. (Ed. Note: As of this edit in 2016, MHI offers the M501F3 at 185 MW and Siemens offers the SGT6-5000F (a.k.a. 501F) at 242MW, approximately the rating of the original 501G, below.) = Introducing the 250 MW-class W501G = Around mid-1994, two announcements were made almost simultaneously - one at the June ASME International Gas Turbine Conference at The Hague and the other at the Edison Electric Institute meeting in Seattle, WA. Westinghouse and its (then) tri- lateral alliance partners, MHI and FiatAvio announced their new W501G (or 501G) high-temperature gas turbine that would operate at 2600F turbine rotor inlet temperature. This announcement was ahead of any such similar announcements by GE or Siemens, both of which were also rumored to be working on their own high-temperature machines. The W501G was touted to be a new machine, with an advanced 17 stage compressor design achieving a 19:1 pressure ratio (vs. 15:1 for the W501F). The combustion section featured DLN combustors with <25ppm NOx on gas (advertised from the start) and, notably, steam-cooled transition ducts. This novel design substantially reduced the amount of cooling air needed in the hot section of the engine, and eliminated the dilution effect of transition cooling air in the combustion zone. The design of the W501G turbine section, while continuing to use the basic traditional 4-stage through-bolted-disc rotor configuration of Westinghouse W501D design, but had technology input from Rolls Royce aero engineering, employing 3-D blading design code for all stationary and rotating rows. It also features advanced material and coatings, as well as improved air-foil cooling designs to withstand the increased hot-gas-path temperatures (250F higher than the W501F at the rotor inlet at the time). The prototype W501G was installed at The City of Lakeland (FL) McIntosh station and was first synchronized to the grid in April, 1999, shortly after the Siemens acquisition of Westinghouse PGBU. For more details on the W501G and the McIntosh plant see Modern Power Systems, Jan. 2001. (It is noted that current Siemens gas turbine product offerings do not include the \\"G\\", as it was replaced, first by the advanced air-cooled \\"F\\" and then by the 300 MW \\"H\\". MHI continues to offer their \\"M501G\\" ‚Äì both steam-cooled and air-cooled, rated at around 270 MW, as well as their new 300 MW-plus model M501J).  Siemens acquisition  In 1998, 55 years after Westinghouse built its first gas turbine engine for the US Navy, Siemens AG of Germany acquired the Power Generation Business Unit (then part of CBS Corp.) and the Westinghouse gas turbine business was integrated into that of Siemens. For the first five years after the acquisition, the Orlando operation was called \\"Siemens Westinghouse\\", temporarily continuing presence of the Westinghouse name. That ended in 2003, when the only name seen at the Orlando office is that of Siemens. For a while, both Siemens and Westinghouse gas turbine models were offered in the 60 Hz markets worldwide, while the 50 Hz markets were served by existing Siemens products. After some time, it was decided that the Westinghouse designs would be the primary basis of the Siemens offerings for all 60 Hz markets (most of the Americas, S. Korea, Saudi Arabia), served by Siemens-Westinghouse staff in Orlando, would be the Westinghouse designs (e.g., the W501F, a.k.a. SGT6-5000F). The 50 Hz markets (covering Europe, Africa, most of Asia and part of South America) was served by Siemens in Germany. As Siemens developed new gas turbine products with more advanced technology, the new optimized offerings incorporated features of both Westinghouse and Siemens technology and design traditions. = Footnote: Boom market follows Siemens acquisition = Just after the sale of the Power Generation Business Unit to Siemens in 1998, the IPP market for gas turbine based cogeneration projects exploded (see chart). Unlike the first PURPA- driven wave of pent-up business in the mid-1980s, where U.S. new-unit gas turbine sales peaked at around 9-10GW the enormous bubble that started in 1997/98 reached an annual sales level that exceeded 60GW! The sales boom was triggered by a number of factors, some of which may have been fabricated by the IPP community itself, and the period represented an unheard of sellers‚Äô market for large gas turbines. Demand was such that the suppliers were rationing their shop space and demanding that customers sign \\"reservation agreements\\" and pay non-refundable deposits. Favorite domestic IPP customers were given preference, and some international opportunities were forgone for lack of units. Needless to say, the Siemens investment of some $6 billion to acquire PGBU from CBS Corp. (oka Westinghouse Electric Corp.) quickly paid off and, in spite of the bubble bursting shortly thereafter, is still providing good returns. Perhaps as foretold 30 years ago, the gas turbine service business is a major revenue and profit generator for Siemens Energy today.  Importance of international markets  From the earliest days of Westinghouse's land-based gas turbine business, markets outside of the U.S. played a very important role in the growth and survival of the business. In the mid-1970s and through the early 1980s, the importance of the international markets, in particular in Saudi Arabia (see below), became critical to the survival of the gas turbine industry as the US electric utility market collapsed. Since earliest applications were primarily in the petrochemical industry, there were many units sold to oil refining and gas-pipeline companies going back to the first W31 (3000 hp) units sold in the mid-1950s for installation in Japan, Sumatra, Cuba and Aruba. These were all used as mechanical drive prime movers. Other important early markets overseas included Libya, Iran and Nigeria (16 W72, 8300 hp mech drive units built by Werkspoor in the Netherlands), Venezuela, Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, Iraq, Syria (7 W82 units also built by Werkspoor), and many units, e.g. 27xW92 10,000 hp units, built for TransCanada and Westcoast Transmission, et al. for pipeline compressor stations in Canada. The largest international project at the time came to be somewhat fortuitously ca. 1955 when ESSO (as Creole Petrol Co., Venezuela) was looking to replace several two-shaft GE mechanical drive units that had failed. Those failures had shown ESSO that a two-shaft solution was unsuitable for handling the tricky job of compressing of wet associated-gas for reinjection under Lake Maracaibo. Westinghouse offered a direct-drive concept in the W101, which proved to be the replacement that was needed to do the job. During the 15-year period from 1956 through 1971, Westinghouse installed nearly 50 W101 direct-drive units on several floating platforms moored in place above the producing wells. Kudos to Tom Putz (Engineering Manager), Don Jones, Sales Manager, Joe Yindra, Project Engineer, and others on the team (including those at ESSO engineering) who made this a major success story and helped put Westinghouse gas turbines firmly on the map. (From interview with Don Jones ‚Äì Dec. 2015) Another important early international project for Westinghouse Gas Turbines was one of the earliest heat recovery applications. This was for the Panama Canal Co. and utilized two W171 (12,000 kW) units, ca. 1963.  Saudi Arabian market develops  In 1969 two W191 (17,000 kW) gas turbines were sold for installation in East Dammam, Saudi Arabia. (These units were built by Werkspoor, in the Netherlands). This appears to be the first Westinghouse gas turbines sold into the Kingdom and represented the beginning of a very important relationship with what ultimately developed into one of the key markets for large 60 Hz gas turbines in the world. As Saudi Arabia developed from the days after WWII to the major supplier of oil, both US and UK influences came into play in electrification of the desert Kingdom, as well as other parts of the Mid-East. Under UK (and other European) influence, the power systems being developed in the region operated at 50 Hz. Under US influence, regional generation, transmission and distribution was developed as a 60 Hz system. Saudi Arabia is the only country in the mid-East with a large 60 Hz system. For Westinghouse, which did not develop its own large 50 Hz direct-drive gas turbine product line, it was fortunate that the main influence in the electrification of the most populated and industrialized part of Saudi Arabia was carried out under the control of ARAMCO, the Arabian-American (Oil) Company (now Saudi Aramco), the major oil producing and refining US/Saudi joint venture company. . Moreover, it was important that the major purchasing operation for ARAMCO was located Houston, TX. (Later, the power system developed by ARAMCO was incorporated into various regional SCECOs (Saudi Consolidated Electric Co.). By the mid-1970s, with ARAMCO buying most of the turbine generators equipment for electrification, Saudi Arabia became a major market for large 60 Hz gas turbines. Ironically, this huge Saudi market materialized just as the US market for gas turbines and combined cycle plants all but evaporated, in large part due to the Arab Oil Embargo of 1975, and subsequent energy legislation passed by the US Congress and Jimmy Carter's administration in 1978. Needless to say, competition from GE and others for the Saudi/Aramco business was fierce. Westinghouse's ability to capitalize on the opportunity and gain its share of the market was due in part to the availability of shop inventory due to many cancellations of orders that came with the slowdown in the domestic market. (Story goes that material for more than 50 W251 and W501s was ordered in anticipation of continued U.S. market in early 1973.) Also to be credited are the talents of the Westinghouse engineering, projects management and sales team, well as the support of Power Systems International and the Houston Field Sales office. = Second wave of Saudi orders prove 'challenging' = The first wave of orders for Saudi projects resulted in some 17 W501D (95.5 MW) EconoPac units being installed at four sites over the period 1976-1981, and Westinghouse established itself as a major player in the Saudi market. Meanwhile, the US market continued to be depressed ‚Äì in fact, at near-zero levels. The only domestic orders of any significance in 1980/81were for the first three W501D5 units ‚Äì the prototype for Gulf States Utilities and two units for Dow Chemical, Plaquemine, LA. Westinghouse also booked an order with CFE for four gas turbines (2xW501D4 and 2xW501D5) to be supplied on an emergency basis for the Tula project (Hidalgo, Mexico). CTSD was under heavy pressure from headquarters to book enough business to support continued factory operations, and once again attention turned to opportunities in Saudi Arabia to absorb the inventory. However, these opportunities were for extended scope projects that came with significant complications and risks that proved to be very challenging for Westinghouse. Bids were submitted and two major orders were obtained from SCECO-Central: one for Hail (5x W501D5) and one for Qaseem (9x W501D). Both plants were to be built on a turnkey contract basis, and, to add to the challenge, they were both to be fueled with treated Saudi crude oil. The use of Saudi crude as a fuel for gas turbines operating at turbine inlet temperature in excess of 2000F posed a significant engineering and operational challenge that apparently was not fully understood when the contracts were signed. (Rumor has it that the fuel contaminant levels, specifically sodium and vanadium, were far in excess of the original specifications, and the fuel treatment systems were undersized. In addition, there was (reportedly) evidence of further contamination of fuel oil during transportation, which was by tanker truck at the time.) All of the earlier Saudi units used natural gas or distillate fuel oil, so there we no such operational and fuel contamination issues involved with those. Also, the broad-scope turnkey nature of both projects required Westinghouse to subcontract with many international companies for the engineering and construction aspects of the work, and for supplying plant equipment and material, exposing the company to even more risk. Combine this with the complexity of long-distance communications between the construction sites and project engineers in Concordville, and you had a recipe for all sorts of technical and logistical problems. (It was said later by personnel directly involved that the telex room at Concordville was typically full of teletype tape every morning with messages from site engineers.) On top of those problems, the contract terms accepted to close the Hail and Qaseem orders were apparently very onerous, including long-term parts warranties that covered damage to hot-path components exposed to corrosive contaminants found in the Saudi crude oil. Suffice to say that the Hail and Qaseem projects turned into major financial setbacks. One result was that there were three changes in general management at Concordville over the next 3‚Äì4 years. Another result, say some, was a period where Westinghouse essentially had to stay in the gas turbine business, despite all of the setbacks and lack of profitable business, under pressure from the Saudis to resolve contractual issues and legal action related to these two projects. Although \\"Hail and Qaseem\\" bring back some difficult memories for those who still remember, it is said that time passes and heals all wounds - or that people tend to forget lessons learned. The records show that Westinghouse decided to take two more orders for crude-oil fueled plants (Asir and Jizan) in the mid-1990s. Presumably, enough was learned about fuel pre-treatment, as well as negotiating contract terms, over the 10 or more years since the signing of the Hail and Qaseem contracts. (It is believed that all of the crude-burning plants in Saudi have since been converted to natural gas fuel, and some to combined cycle operation.) In mentioning Westinghouse business in Saudi, it is import to include the name ISCOSA. That was (and is still ) the joint venture company formed in 1973 with a local business group to establish an in-country presence to service the growing fleet of Westinghouse gas turbines in the Kingdom. And with the mention of ISCOSA it is important also to mention the name of Tex Knight, who served as the General Manager of the operation from 1977-1987.  Other important international markets  During the 1990s, in spite of a relative active U.S. market, Westinghouse participated actively in other significant international markets for gas turbines. These included major successes with customers in South Korea (some 35-40 units), especially Korean Electric Power Co. (KEPCO) and Hanwha Energy. In Latin America, a large market was developed in Venezuela, especially with Electricidad de Caracas, and in Colombia, with orders for W501D5 and 501F units obtained for several locations, including one in rebel-held jungle! A significant order was obtained in Argentina (CAPSA) for 3xW251B11 and 1x701D, and the first-ever large gas turbine orders were obtained for W501D5 units both in Peru and Ecuador. In fact, in 1992, Westinghouse Power Generation Marketing received special corporate recognition as the \\"Best of the Best\\" for its international successes (mostly in Latin America) in placing gas turbine orders. Several orders were also obtained during the period for both W251 and W501 EconoPacs for installation atop specially designed barges to produce floating portable power plants for deployment around the world. Most of these barges were built by Sabah Shipyards in Malaysia.

He was also the second man to fly the Supermarine Spitfire after Vickers Aviation's chief test pilot, Joseph \\"Mutt\\" Summers. After succeeding Summers as Vickers' chief test pilot, Quill test-flew every mark of Spitfire. Quill's work on the aircraft aided its development from a promising but untried prototype to become, with the Hawker Hurricane, an instrument of the Royal Air Force's victory in the Battle of Britain. The Spitfire later played a leading role in gaining Allied air superiority over Europe.The Times, 29 February 1996 Quill later wrote two books about the Spitfire. Early years Quill was born at Littlehampton, Sussex, the youngest of the five children of Arthur Maxwell Quill and Emily Molesworth Kindersley. He was educated at Lancing College, which overlooked Shoreham aerodrome, at that time a small grass field with old hangars and a wooden hut for a flying club. While at Lancing, Quill became Captain of Gibbs House (1930) and Prefect (1931). He played in the Cricket XI (1930‚Äì31); Football XI (1929‚Äì30); and was Sergeant in the OTC, Cert. A.Lancing Register Long before he left school in 1931, the nearby aerial activity had prompted Quill to seek a non-commissioned career in the Royal Air Force. While still a pupil at Lancing, he attended the famous annual RAF displays at Hendon. Two years later he participated in the event. Aviation career At the age of 18, Quill was accepted into the Royal Air Force as an acting pilot officer. He learned to fly on Avro Tutor biplanes at No. 3 Flying Training School at Grantham, and went solo after the short time of 5 hours 20 minutes (9 hours being regarded as the norm). He graduated to Siskin IIIA advanced trainers, and his flying ability was assessed as exceptional. In September 1932 he joined No. 17 Squadron RAF at Upavon, where he began flying Bristol Bulldog fighters. While with 17 Squadron he took part in the Royal Air Force display at Hendon in June 1933, demonstrating low flying in a mock bombing attack.'Britain's Test Pilots', Flight, June 1946, p.580Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford, 2004 He flew as often as possible to familiarise himself with the aeroplane, practising aerobatics and flying in cloud. He was well aware of the dangers of flying and later wrote: =Meteorological Flight= At the end of 1933 Quill was posted to the RAF Meteorological Flight at Duxford. There he joined a small team flying obsolescent Armstrong Whitworth Siskin IIIAs with open cockpits, no artificial horizon or radio, and only the most rudimentary blind-flying instruments (a Reid & Sigrist \\"turn- and-bank\\" indicator and an inclinometer). Wearing electrically-heated suits which plugged into a socket in the cockpit, the unit made twice-daily scheduled flights (except on Sundays) up to 25,000 ft to collect data at 1,000-foot intervals on temperature, humidity and cloud formation for weather reports. On landing, the results had to be signalled or telephoned immediately to the Met Office at Adastral House in London. After Quill took command of the flight in November 1934 he and his team managed to fly every slot for a whole year, regardless of \\"unflyable\\" weather and without missing a flight. For this hazardous achievement Quill was awarded the Air Force Cross at the age of 23. On one occasion, when letting down through cloud, his Siskin hit the ground hard but in perfect landing attitude, bounced over a hedge and overturned, pushing Quill's head forward on to the cockpit coaming (its raised border). Had he not already received a broken nose from an accident when boxing for the RAF, he would have qualified for the \\"Siskin nose\\" ‚Äì a characteristic of many pilots of the period. =Supermarine Spitfire= In January 1936 Quill applied for release from the RAF and joined Vickers (Aviation) Ltd at Brooklands, as assistant to its chief test pilot, Joseph \\"Mutt\\" Summers. His initial task was the testing of the Wellesley bomber, and it was while flying a production Wellesley that Quill had a narrow escape. The 74 ft 7 in-wingspan bomber refused to recover from a spin and at 3,000 ft Quill decided to bail out. As he descended, the spiralling bomber seemed intent on slicing the pilot with its wings, but he landed safely not far from the Kingston bypass. There was some rivalry between Vickers (Aviation) Ltd and Hawker Aircraft, whose Hurricane had first flown four months earlier. Jeffrey Quill's long association with the Spitfire began when, aged 23, he made his first flight in the prototype fighter K5054 on 26 March 1936 ‚Äì Mutt Summers having made the maiden flight three weeks earlier ‚Äì and his priority was to get the Spitfire cleared for acceptance by the RAF. The Spitfire needed a great deal of work before it was deemed safe for young RAF pilots to fly, and it did not enter squadron service until July 1938. However, developed through many marks and variants, the Spitfire remained a first-line fighter throughout the war. After transferring full-time to Vickers Supermarine in 1938, Quill took complete charge of Spitfire test flying, working closely with Joseph (Joe) Smith who had taken over as chief designer for Supermarine in 1937, following the death of R.J. Mitchell in the same year. Second World War During the Second World War, Quill was in charge of development and production flying at Vickers Supermarine, a job that he took so seriously that he felt he must obtain first-hand combat experience. Following the fall of France in 1940, he was determined to rejoin a fighter squadron. Forestalling opposition from his employers at Vickers Supermarine, he successfully argued the need to gain front-line operational experience and was temporarily released on 5 August 1940 to join No. 65 Squadron at RAF Hornchurch, privately hoping that it would be a permanent appointment. On 16 August he shot down a Messerschmitt Bf 109 and two days later he shared a victory over a Heinkel He 111. His combat days were short-lived because he was recalled after nineteen days to test the Spitfire Mk III, but they made Quill all the more determined to make the Spitfire an even better fighting machine, and his experiences in the Battle of Britain led to two important changes in the Spitfire. At high speed, the stick force from the ailerons had been very heavy, and this was found to be caused by the ballooning of the fabric covering of the ailerons, and so causing a thicker trailing edge section. This was cured by fitting stiffer, metal- covered ailerons. Quill also initiated an improvement in the optical quality of the cockpit side panels. His concerns about rearward vision from the cockpit led to changes and improvements to the canopy and rear fuselage. Later in 1940 he became chief test pilot for Vickers Armstrongs (Supermarine) Works. =No. 12 Commando and 'Operation Airthief'= By 1942 the Luftwaffe's Focke- Wulf Fw 190 was gaining the edge over Allied fighters, and it was an urgent priority to capture an airworthy example. For a while Quill was on standby to be taken to France to hijack a Fw 190 back to England. His friend Captain Philip Pinckney, a Commando officer, had prepared a daring proposal for approval by Combined Operations Headquarters, with the code name 'Operation Airthief', proposing that the two of them penetrate an airfield in occupied France.National Archives, Kew PRO DEFE 2 Privately, Quill did not rate their chances of survival very highly. Fortunately, on 23 June 1942 ‚Äì coinciding with the submission of the paper to Combined Operations ‚Äì a disoriented German pilot, Oberleutnant Armin Faber, mistook the Bristol Channel for the English Channel and landed an Fw 190 A-3 at RAF Pembrey in south Wales.Quill, Spitfire: a Test Pilot's Story (paperback) pp. 222‚Äì227 Not long afterwards, Quill flew the captured German aircraft at Farnborough.Quill, Spitfire. p. 227 =Fleet Air Arm= In January 1943 Quill was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire. From November 1943 to April 1944 he served with the Fleet Air Arm, as a lieutenant commander, helping to develop better carrier-deck-landings with the Supermarine Seafire, the naval version of the Spitfire. With the introduction of the Seafire, the Fleet Air Arm had suffered serious losses in deck-landing accidents. After a deck-landing course at Easthaven, Quill served on the training carrier , and then the escort carrier , which had two Seafire squadrons (No.s 879 and 886) on board. He flew with both squadrons and was later attached to 1837 (Fighter) squadron, which was shore-based. During his time with the Navy he made more than 75 deck landings. The distinguished naval test pilot Eric Brown later wrote: \\"Jeffrey was an inspired choice, as he had the analytical mind of a superb test pilot, trained to find answers to any flight problem.\\" By the time Quill returned to Supermarine he knew the problems thoroughly, having deck-landed all the British and American carrier types, with the exception of the Fairey Firefly. By the end of the war he had personally test-flown all variants of the Spitfire and Seafire. Postwar In the immediate postwar era, Quill continued as a test pilot, flying the latest Supermarine jets, including the Attacker and Swift. By 1947 he had made the first flights and masterminded the development and production test flying of all 52 variants of the Spitfire ‚Äì the only allied fighter to remain in full production and front-line service throughout the Second World War. He also made the first flights of the Dumbo (an experimental variable-incidence wing torpedo bomber to S.24/37), the Spiteful, the Seafang and, on 27 July 1946, the Attacker, the Royal Navy's first jet fighter. Later he became a military aircraft marketing executive for the British Aircraft Corporation ‚Äì BAC. After his retirement he became a prolific author, chronicling the Spitfire and its legacy through: Spitfire: A Test Pilot's Story (1983), and Birth of a Legend: The Spitfire (1986). Having retired with his wife Claire to the Isle of Man, Jeffrey Quill became involved with an annual lecture given by the Association of Manx Pilots, later to become the Jeffrey Quill Memorial Lecture. He was elected President of the Spitfire Society. =Death= Jeffrey Quill passed away at his home in the village of Andreas, Isle of Man, on 20 February 1996.https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituaryjeffrey- quill-1340389.html He is buried in St Andrew's church yard, the church being near to the former fighter station RAF Andreas which operated Spitfires from 1941 to 1942. After Jeffrey Quill's death in 1996 the British aviation society, the Air League, created a new award in his name, and since 1997 they have awarded the Jeffrey Quill Medal annually \\"for an outstanding contribution to the development of air-mindedness in Britain's youth\\". Portrayal in film The First of the Few (released in 1942 and known in the US as Spitfire) was a British feature film, in which David Niven played the part of \\"Geoffrey Crisp\\", a composite character based on Quill and the Schneider Trophy pilots of 1927, 1929 and 1931. On 1‚Äì2 November 1941, Quill flew to RAF Northolt in a Spitfire Mk II, mocked up to resemble the prototype K5054. Flying for over an hour on 1 November and for 45 minutes on 2 November, he performed the aerobatic flying sequences that are shown in the final 15 minutes of the film.J. K.

She was the second ship to bear the name. After twenty years of service, including involvement in the West Indies campaigns during the French Revolutionary Wars, she was converted into a bomb vessel in 1798. In this capacity she took part in attacks on French ports, and was present at both battles of Copenhagen. The Navy sold her in 1812. American Revolution Zebra was built to a design by Edward Hunt, and launched and commissioned in August 1780 under Commander John Bourchier. She then served in the Downs Squadron during the closing stages of the American Revolutionary War. On 10 February 1781 she was in company with when they captured the American privateer Revenge. Then around 10 May she was in company with the sloop and the cutters and when they recaptured the Industry, Chew, master, and the Jenny, Dane, master. Zebra sent them into Dover.Lloyd's List, ‚Ññ1267, - accessed 17 June 2014. Zebra sailed for Jamaica on 10 February 1782. On 14 April 1782 Zebra was with Admiral Sir George Brydges Rodney, the commander-in chief of the Leeward Islands station, at the Battle of the Saintes. She was in Rear-Admiral Sir Samuel Hood's division. During fleet engagements, only large ships-of-the-line of over 50 guns traditionally took part in the battles and the small Zebra did not participate in a battle. Smaller vessels like Zebra would be used to relay messages, tow damaged ships out of the line or rescue seaman. On 28 June Zebra, under the command of Commander John Loncraft, was in company with when they captured the American privateer Tartar. Late in 1782 Zebra and escorted a fleet from Georgia \\"with the principal inhabitants, their Negroes, and their Effects\\" to Jamaica.Lloyd's List, ‚Ññ1415, - accessed 17 June 2014. On 19 January 1783 Zebra captured the brig Providence on the Leeward Islands. Commander E. Pakenham took command in April 1783 in the Leeward Islands. She returned from the West Indies to the UK after 1783. From January to October 1786 she underwent repairs at Woolwich. Commander C. Boyles commissioned her 1787. Then between April and May 1789 she underwent fitting for service it the Channel. Zebra was recommissioned in August under Commander the Honourable Robert Forbes. In November 1790 she came under the command of Commander William Brown and sailed for the Mediterranean on 22 November. From April to July 1793 she was back at Woolwich for repairs. French Revolutionary Wars =Sloop= In June 1793 Commander Robert Faulknor recommissioned Zebra. He sailed her for the Leeward Islands on 26 November. In 1794, Zebra participated in the capture of Martinique by the expeditionary force under the command of Admiral Sir John Jervis and Lieutenant General Sir Charles Grey. In February 1794 the English attacked Martinique. By 20 March, only Fort Bourbon and Fort Royal still held out. Jervis ordered the third rate ship of the line (64 guns), and the Zebra to take Fort Saint Louis. Asia was unable to get close, and so Commander Faulknor went in without Asias help. Despite facing heavy fire, Faulknor ran Zebra close under the walls. He and his ship's company then used Zebras boats to land. The British stormed the fort and captured it. Zebra lost only her pilot killed and four men wounded. Meanwhile the boats of the British fleet captured Fort Royal and two days later Fort Bourbon capitulated. Jervis promoted Faulknor to post-captain and gave him command of the French 28-gun sixth-rate frigate Bienvenue, which the British had captured at Fort Royal and which Jervis renamed in Faulknor's honour. In 1847, the feat earned the remaining survivors of Zebras crew the Naval General Service Medal with the clasp \\"Zebra 17 March 1794\\". The crew also qualified for the clasp \\"17 Mar. Boat Service 1794\\" for the capture of the French frigate Bienvenue and other vessels in Fort Royal Bay. In March Commander Richard Bowen replaced Faulknor, only to be replaced in April by Lieutenant Lancelot Skynner. Commander George Vaughn replaced Skynner within the month. On 14 April 1794 Zebra was present at the capture of Basse-Terre, Guadeloupe. Zebra returned to Fort Royal on 4 December with the French schooner Carmagnols, which she had taken on 30 November off Saint Lucia. Carmangnole had a crew of 35 men and was armed with 10 guns. French records show that Carmagnole was a schooner that the French Navy had commissioned in 1793 at Guadeloupe. Zebra had taken her after having run her ashore on La D√©sirade. The captures of Martinique, Guadeloupe and Saint Lucia yielded prize money for the captains and crews of the vessels involved, and for the army units. Early in 1795, Zebra, under Captain Skinner, supported the British Army in suppressing an insurrection by the indigenous Caribs on St Vincent. Then captured the 10-gun Brutus off Grenada on 10 October 1795, followed by the 18-gun French corvette R√©publicaine on 14 October 1795. Zebra, under the command of Commander Norborne Thompson, shared in the prize money by agreement. In January 1796, Commander David M'Iver assumed command. Shortly thereafter, and Zebra captured a privateer and recaptured two schooners. On 12 September Zebra, under Commander John Hurst, captured the Victoire between Grenada and Tobago. Victoire was armed with six guns and had a crew of 65 men. She was eight days out of Guadeloupe and had captured a sloop from Barbados with a cargo of provisions for Martinique. had recaptured the sloop off Marie-Galante. At some point Zebra captured the Spanish ship Santa Maria Magdalena. Early in 1797 Admiral Henry Harvey sent Zebra to Tobago to gather a detachment of troops. Zebra then rendezvoused with Harvey and his flotilla at the island of Carriacou, in the Grenadines, for the invasion of Trinidad. The flotilla sailed from Carriacou on 15 February and arrived off Port of Spain on the 16th. At Port of Spain they found a Spanish squadron consisting of four ships of the line and a frigate, all under the command of Rear-Admiral Don Sebastian Ruiz de Apodaca. Harvey sent Zebra and some of the other smaller ships to protect the transports and anchored his own ships of the line opposite the Spanish squadron. At 2am on 17 February the British discovered that four of the five Spanish vessels were on fire; they were able to capture the 74-gun San Domaso but the others were destroyed.The five Spanish ships were San Vincente (Captain Don Geronimo Mendoza; 84 guns), Gallardo (Captain Don Gabriel Sororido; 74 guns), Arrogante (Captain Don Raphael Benasa; 74 guns), San Damaso (Don Tores Jordan; 74 guns), and Santa Cecilia (Captain Don Manuel Urtesabel; 36 guns). Later that morning General Sir Ralph Abercrombie landed the troops. The Governor of Trinidad, Jos√© Maria Chac√≥n, surrendered the next day. Zebra shared with the rest of the flotilla in the allocation of ¬£40,000 for the proceeds of the ships taken at Trinidad and of the property found on the island. Hurst died in March 1797. It is not clear who sailed Zebra back to Britain for paying off and laying up. =Bomb vessel= Between March and April 1798, Wells & Co. converted Zebra to a bomb vessel at a cost of ¬£4,319. She then spent April through June at Deptford Dockyard undergoing a full conversion, which cost ¬£7,392. Commander Thomas Sparke recommissioned her in April. On 28 August 1799 Zebra was with the British fleet that captured the Dutch hulks Drotchterland and Brooderschap, and the ships Helder, Venus, Minerva, and Hector, in the Nieuwe Diep, in Holland. The capture of these vessels was part of the Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland and preceded by two days the Vlieter Incident in which a large part of the navy of the Batavian Republic, commanded by Rear-Admiral Samuel Story, surrendered to the British navy on a sandbank near the Channel known as De Vlieter, near Wieringen. Zebra was also among the vessels sharing in the prize money from the Dutch vessels of the Vlieter Incident. In December 1799 Zebra was under Commander Edward Sneyd Clay in the North Sea. Zebras, next major campaign was the Battle of Copenhagen in 1801. She suffered no casualties. In 1847, Zebras surviving crew qualified to receive the Naval General Service Medal with the clasp \\"Copenhagen 1801\\". Napoleonic Wars Between March and May 1803 Zebra underwent another fitting out at Woolwich. Commander William Beauchamp-Proctor was appointed to command of her in April 1803. On 20 July 1804, Zebra was in the company of hired armed cutter Favorite and some other vessels when Zebra captured Shepherdess. Nine days later, Zebra, captured Postillion. In July and August 1804 Zebra participated in the squadron under Captain Robert Dudley Oliver in at the bombardment of French vessels at Le Havre. The bomb vessels' shells and carcasses set the town on fire on 23 July. On 1 August, the vessels kept a continuous fire for three hours. Still, it is not clear that the bombardment did much damage to the French flotilla. On 31 July the squadron did capture the French vessel Papillon. Zebra was recommissioned in August 1804 under Commander William Parkinson. Lieutenant George Harris replaced him in 1805. His replacement, in March 1806, was Commander Thomas Whinyates. Under Whinyates Zebra was on the North Sea station. Commander William Bowles took over in 1807. The Zebra then returned to Copenhagen for the second battle of Copenhagen in 1807. Zebra joined the \\"Advanced Squadron\\", which was protecting the batteries the British were building to support their attack on the city. On 17 August, the bomb vessels opened fire on the city's flotilla of row boats whose fire was harassing the left of the British line. Zebra was one of several vessels sharing in the capture of the Danish merchant vessel Sally on 22 August. Zebra was one of six British warships that shared in the capture on 23 August of the Danish vessel Speculation. On 2 September, the bomb vessels joined the land-based mortar batteries in bombarding Copenhagen. The bombardment set the town on fire and the Danes finally asked for an armistice on 5 September. The prize money for Copenhagen to an ordinary seaman was ¬£3 8s. On 20 June 1808, Zebra was in the Baltic, under the command of Thomas R. Toker, when she captured the Danish sloop Emenzius. Commander George Trollope took command in January 1809. Fate Zebra was laid up in May 1809 at Deptford. She was put up for sale on 13 August 1812. She was sold there at that time.

In his 20s he worked as a rocket scientist at Peenem√ºnde and the Mittelwerk. At age 26, he emigrated to the United States via Operation Paperclip, where he worked for some years at Fort Bliss. In 1955 he began a career as a senior executive with Chrysler's missile and later automotive divisions, retiring in 1975. He lived for 58 years partially in the United States and partially in the United Kingdom until his death. He was the brother of Sigismund and Wernher von Braun. Biography Von Braun was born in Greifswald, Pomerania, to Magnus Freiherr von Braun and Emmy von Quistorp. After completing boarding school at Hermann Lietz-Schule in Spiekeroog, he began his studies in 1937 at Technische Universit√§t M√ºnchen. There he remained after receiving his master's degree in organic chemistry, and became an assistant to Nobel laureate Hans Fischer. Von Braun arrived at Peenem√ºnde in July 1943 at the request of Wernher von Braun. In March 1944 he was arrested with fellow rocket specialists Wernher von Braun, Klaus Riedel, Helmut Gr√∂ttrup, and Hannes L√ºersen, but was later released. In late summer 1944 he transferred to the Mittelwerk where he engineered V-2 rocket gyroscopes, servomotors, and turbopumps. The Mittelwerk was an underground munitions factory dug into Germany's Harz Mountains in order to avoid aerial bombardment by British and American planes. It consisted of two tunnels bored through the mountain range near the town of Nordhausen, each a mile long and connected by dozens of cross tunnels. Railways laid through the main tunnels brought raw materials in and finished rockets out. The entire cavity provided some 35 million cubic feet of space. After massive Allied bombing disrupted the original V-2 development center in the Baltic town of Peenem√ºnde in mid-1943, the majority of German rocket production was moved to the Mittelwerk. Prisoners from the nearby Mittelbau-Dora concentration camps provided slave labor for this huge endeavor. Inmates were marched into the tunnels daily and compelled to work by the notorious Nazi SS, who handled all security issues. The usual horrific methods were employed and over 20,000 slaves perished during this subterranean rocket factory's existence. Magnus von Braun's involvement with the Mittelwerk began in the fall of 1944, soon after full production began. The first V-2s produced earlier that year had a high failure rate and sabotage was suspected. Concern about these problems prompted Wernher, who was still based at Peenem√ºnde, to send his younger brother to the Mittelwerk in September. While some minor sabotage did occur in the tunnels, it was relatively rare. The real reason for the poor quality of early Mittelwerk missiles was the effort to take cutting-edge research technology and put it into mass production under slave labor conditions. Tossed into this brutal environment, Magnus reported directly to the factory's chief of rocket production, Arthur Rudolph, who had an office in one of the main tunnels. This work connection with Rudolph would span decades and continents. After Germany surrendered in 1945, Rudolph was part of a group of Nazi scientists who emigrated with the von Braun brothers to the United States as part of Operation Paperclip. The U.S. Army put them to work in New Mexico developing intercontinental ballistic missiles. Moving on to NASA in the 1960s, Rudolph continued to collaborate with Magnus, who by then was employed by the main contractor for the Saturn V lunar rocket, Chrysler Corporation. As Nasa's project director for the Saturn V, Rudolph was publicly acclaimed after the moon landing, but towards the end of his life, his wartime complicity in using slave labor at the Mittelwerk became more widely known. These revelations then forced Rudolph to make a 1983 deal with the U.S. Justice Department in which he voluntarily relinquished his U.S. citizenship to avoid prosecution and possible loss of his government pension and Social Security benefits. Rudolph then returned to Germany, where he died in 1996. In November 1944, Rudolph put Magnus in charge of rocket fin servomotors, which were the most troublesome V-2 component at that time. During this period, concerns over sabotage were at their height. In a notorious incident that winter, several Russian prisoners suspected of sabotage were executed by being hanged from cranes used to lift rocket parts and left dangling for a full work day, as an example to other inmates. In this tense atmosphere, servomotors were at the heart of two abuse accusations leveled against Wernher von Braun by Mittelwerk prisoners after the war, one that may have actually involved Magnus. Michael Neufeld, a Smithsonian historian and author of a 2007 biography of Wernher, has tried to unravel claims by Dora prisoners that they personally witnessed brutality administered by the more famous von Braun brother. In a 2002 article about Wernher's potential culpability in Nazi slave labor at Mittelwerk and several other locations, Neufeld dismissed most claims that von Braun carried out direct sadistic behavior as spurious, easily disproved by tracking his known locations during the war. However, Neufeld felt that there were two accusations in particular that merited further study, the second of which might have involved Magnus. \\"[R]eports that [Wernher] von Braun attended hangings, ordered hangings, attended hangings in SS uniform, etc., have scarcely been discussed in the literature because such testimonies lack credibility,\\" Neufeld wrote. \\"But in recent years I have received two reports from French Dora survivors that deserve more consideration.\\" In the first incident, survivor Georges Jouanin, whose job was to climb into upright tail sections of V-2s to install cables to the servomotor, placed a wood shoe on one of the units. He later recorded that \\"someone has noticed my wooden-heeled clog atop such a fragile organ, and I feel a hand pulling insistently on the end of my striped pants, thus forcing me out of the tail unit. 'You, out of here, man, you're committing sabotage. You shouldn't step with your foot on this.' I get slapped in the face twice and my head bounces against the metal panels of the tail unit. Cap in hand, I find myself in front of a man in his 30s, rather well dressed, angry, to who I am not allowed to give an explanation. The seven or eight engineers or technicians in the group of which he came out seem disconcerted, astonished... I went back to my work space and the incident seemed over, without consequences. My civilian foreman, Manger is his name, returns from break and tells me ... 'Our big boss boxed your ears! That was V. Braun.'\\" In the second case, an inmate named Guy Morand testified that while testing rocket servomotors, he tried to cover for another prisoner who had mislaid a chronometer, which brought the wrath of an enraged foreman down upon him. \\"Like the good Nazi he was,\\" Morand remembered, \\"he immediately started shouting it was sabotage, when just at that point von Braun arrived accompanied by his usual group of people. Without even listening to my explanations, he ordered the Meister to have me given 25 strokes in his presence by an SS [man] who was there. Then, judging that the strokes weren't sufficiently hard, he ordered that I be flogged more vigorously, and this order was then diligently carried out.\\" Morand went on to say that \\"following the floggings, von Braun made me translate that I deserved much more, that in fact I deserved to be hanged, which certainly would be the fate of the 'Mensch' (good-for-nothing) I was.\\" Morand adds that the man was \\"one of the inventors of the V-2\\" and frequently made \\"rapid inspections\\" of his work area. This description of \\"von Braun\\" is closer to Magnus in his role at the rocket factory than that of Wernher, who visited only occasionally. Neufeld raises the possibility of an identity error in Morand's recollections: \\"In September 1944, Wernher assigned his younger brother Magnus, a chemical engineer and Luftwaffe pilot, as his special liaison to the Mittelwerk, particularly for servomotor production, which was afflicted with serious technical problems. Magnus von Braun stayed in the Nordhausen area full-time until the evacuation of April, 1945. In contrast, his older brother visited the Mittelwerk, by his estimates, twelve or fifteen times in total. Morand gives the time of the incident as the 'second half of 1944,' which corresponds to Magnus von Braun's assignment to the factory, and the testimonial never actually gives 'von Braun' a last name.\\" In a footnote to this same 2002 article, Neufeld refers to another incident on the record. A Dora survivor named Robert Cazabonne reported \\"that a fellow prisoner witnessing a hanging in the tunnel pointed out one of the German onlookers and said, 'That's VON BRAUN!'\\" Neufeld concludes, \\"We know with near certainty that Wernher von Braun was not there; however, it might have been his brother Magnus, as civilian employees were expected to attend.\\" Neufeld continues, \\"Morand's story necessarily brings Jouanin's identification into question, as both deal with servomotors. Although Jouanin's first instinct on timing was early May 1944, when I wrote him about it, he was less than certain. The description of a man in his thirties he saw only once fits Wernher von Braun better than Magnus, however. In the end, it is impossible to say with certainty that Georges Jouanin's identification of Wernher von Braun can be accepted as meeting a reasonable standard of certainty, as believable as I find it personally. Nor can we conclude with assurance that Magnus von Braun was responsible ...\\" These prisoner recollections of a sadistic scientist named von Braun stalking the Mittelwerk tunnels, especially on occasions when it can be shown that Wernher could not have been there, is not final proof of Magnus's guilt. However, the possibility of the younger brother's involvement in such abuse requires consideration of an unpleasant facet of his personality that was documented in postwar U.S. Army files kept on all former Nazi scientists who worked in the United States. Magnus was born nearly a decade after his two older brothers, who had come of age before the Nazis took power in Germany. Unlike them, Magnus had a National Socialist adolescence. While the older brothers can be seen as having joined the Nazi party for reasons of professional advancement, Magnus signed on to fascism at a point in life before such concerns became important. His was an ideological commitment. He was thirteen when Hitler became chancellor and thus participated in the Hitler Youth organization and experienced a secondary school environment and curriculum adapted to fascism. His politicized early years naturally influenced his character. Even after the war, Magnus stood apart from Wernher by his displays of arrogance and aristocratic pretension, duly noted by the Army officers who kept files on both men after their 1945 immigration to the United States. Sigismund, the eldest brother, became a diplomatic attach√© for the German government in 1936 and passed his war years in Vatican City on consular duty. Though a Nazi party member like his brothers, he avoided direct complicity with regime atrocities such as slave labor and was able to join the new West German foreign service after the war. He rose to become a notable diplomat for West Germany during the 1960s and 1970s. Surrender at Reutte After evacuating from Nordhausen, Magnus von Braun was at the Behelfsheim in Weilheim when Wernher von Braun arrived there from Oberammergau on 14 April 1945. The next day, Magnus had arrived at the Haus Ingeborg in Oberjoch by the end of the day. When Huzel became von Braun's assistant, Dr. Kurt Debus became Engineer in Charge of Test Stand VII‚ÄîHuzel had served since May 1944 after replacing his old friend Hartmut Kuechen. The Mittelwerk was designated for production after the 17 August 1943 Operation Hydra bombing of Peenem√ºnde, and production started well afterward, so Magnus von Braun's claim that he was selected to transfer in October 1943 is inaccurate. After hearing the radio report of Hitler's death, Wernher von Braun announced to his group early in the morning of 3 May 1945 that \\"Magnus, who speaks English, has just left by bicycle to establish contact with the American forces at Reutte. We cannot wait here forever.\\" \\"It was quite courageous for Magnus to come down on his bicycle and find the American troops,\\" said Dr. Ernst Stuhlinger, member of the V-2 team. \\"He had a white handkerchief tied to the handlebars of the bicycle and that was all he had to protect him.\\" About two in the afternoon, Magnus returned, \\"I think it went well, I have safe conduct passes and they want us for further interrogation.\\" The Mission Accomplished: The Battle History of the 44th Infantry Division claim that there was a \\"hectic night of interrogation, plans and counter-proposals\\" after Magnus von Braun rode his bike downhill in the morning and met members of the \\"Anti-tank Company, 324th Infantry\\" \\"before he went out and in a short time returned with his brother\\" is inaccurate: Huzel, McGovern, & Ordway, in their researched works, distinctly state Magnus returned about 2 in the afternoon the same day. Dieter Huzel described the surrender of the group: \\"Thus, in the dull, rainy, late afternoon of Wednesday, May 2, 1945, seven men [Magnus & Wernher, Walter Dornberger, Axster, Huzel, Lindenberg, & Tessman] ... began their lonely descent from Adolf Hitler Pass toward ... Schattwald. ... Suddenly, around a curve, an American soldier ... waved us to a stop. Magnus got out and showed a piece of paper to the guard ... After about a half an hour, ... we were flanked by two ...\\"jeeps,\\"... We reached Reutte after dark. ... The next morning ... we emerged from the mess hall ... several Army photographers were on hand and spent some time taking pictures.\\" During a photo shoot the next day, Magnus von Braun commented \\"We're celebrating now, but I'll bet they will throw telephone books at us if we ever reach New York. By noon, Magnus von Braun (along with Axster, Huzel, Lindenberg, & Tessman) arrived in Peiting where forty other Peenem√ºnde personnel already had arrived, and the Germans departed for Garmisch-Partenkirchen on 8 May. Operation Paperclip and work at Fort Bliss Von Braun arrived in New York on 16 November 1945 aboard the SS Argentina and was soon at work at Fort Bliss, Texas and later at Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama. Von Braun was interrogated as a witness for the Andrae war crimes trial in which Mittelwerk general manager Georg Rickhey was acquitted. Fort Bliss Army CIC agents believed he was a \\"dangerous German Nazi\\", with one agent remarking, \\"his type is a worse threat to security than a half a dozen discredited SS Generals.\\" Soon after his arrival, he was caught trying to sell a brick of platinum he'd stolen from the base to a jeweler in El Paso. The incident was quickly hushed up, though he was informally punished by means of a terrible beating given by his brother Wernher. Career with Chrysler In 1955, von Braun began a career with Chrysler‚Äîfirst in the missile division and then in the automotive division. After living in Michigan, he relocated to the UK, working in London and Coventry as Chrysler UK export director. He also resided in Huntsville, Alabama, for a while. Von Braun retired from Chrysler in 1975 and remained in Coventry for a few years before returning to the States, where he settled in Arizona and resided until his death.

On June 3, 2007, Trinity Sunday, the Sunday after Pentecost, he was killed along with three subdeacons including his cousin Basman Yousef Daud, Wahid Hanna Isho, and Gassan Isam Bidawed in front of Mosul's Holy Spirit Chaldean Church where he was parish priest. Ganni had just finished celebrating the Sunday evening Holy Qurbana (Mass). The three deacons had recently decided to accompany Ganni because of threats against his life. After Mass he was walking away from the church with Daud as Isho, Bidawed, and Isho's wife followed by car; the group was stopped by unknown armed men. One of the gunmen shouted at Ganni that he had warned him to close the church and demanded to know why he didn't do it. Ganni replied asking \\"How can I close the house of God?\\" The gunmen ordered the woman to flee. Then after the gunmen demanded that the four men convert to Islam and they refused, the four were shot down.http://www.aina.org/news/20090603124803.pdf The car was then set with explosives to deter interference and so that the bodies would remain abandoned. Several hours passed until a police bomb-squad defused the devices allowing corpses to be recovered. Thousands of people attended the funeral of the four men in Karemlash, Iraq on June 4, 2007. Ganni was secretary to Paulos Faraj Rahho, the Archbishop of Mosul of the Chaldean Church, Iraq's largest Christian community. Rahho was murdered only nine months after Ganni's death, in the same city of Mosul. Biography Ragheed Aziz Ganni was born on January 20, 1972 in the predominantly Sunni city of Mosul, Iraq. After completing a degree in Civil Engineering at Mosul University in 1996 and fulfilling obligatory military service under the Saddam Hussein regime Ganni entered the seminary in Iraq. In 1996 Ganni's bishop sent him to Rome for further study at the Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas Angelicum where he completed a licentiate in ecumenical theology in 2003. He was ordained a priest in Rome on October 13, 2001 at the Pontifical Urbaniana University. During his study in Rome he resided at the Pontifical Irish College where he played soccer for the College. The annual showcase 5-a-side tournament played in May among the Scots, English, Beda and Irish Colleges has been named the \\"Ragheed Cup\\" in his memory. Ganni celebrated his first Mass in the Chapel at the Irish College. Today Ganni is one of the nine figures represented in the apse of that chapel where the relics of Saint Oliver Plunkett rest in the altar wrapped in the priestly stole of Ganni. Ganni regularly offered Mass for the Lay Centre at Foyer Unitas which was at the time housed on the grounds of the Irish College. Fluent in Aramaic, Arabic, Italian, French, and English, Ganni served as a correspondent for the international agency Asia News of the Pontifical Institute for Foreign Missions. Ganni was finishing his degree in Rome when the Iraq war broke out. Ganni had received permission from his bishop to return to the Angelicum in Rome to work on a doctorate in ecumenism. In a prewar interview he expressed his opposition to the invasion of Iraqi fearing that Iraqi Christians would be targeted and persecuted. He looked forward to returning to his native land to serve the Church and people there. He did so after Saddam Hussein was ousted from power in 2003. The Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Bertone telegrammed Ragheed's bishop on behalf of Pope Benedict XVI saying that \\"Ragheed's sacrifice will inspire in the hearts of all men and women of good will a renewed resolve to reject the ways of hatred and violence, to conquer evil with good and to cooperate in hastening the dawn of reconciliation, justice and peace in Iraq.\\" Ganni has since been declared a Servant of God, a preliminary step in being canonized as a Catholic saint.

Species There are currently two recognized species in this genus: * Parapimelodus nigribarbis (Boulenger, 1889) * Parapimelodus valenciennis (L√ºtken, 1874) Distribution The two species of Parapimelodus are isolated from each other. P. valenciennis is known from the Uruguay, La Plata, Paraguay, and the lower to middle Paran√° Rivers. P. nigribarbis is restricted to the Lagoa dos Patos system. Description The body is compressed and becomes strongly compressed at the tail. The head is slightly depressed and the mouth is slightly inferior, with the upper jaw longer than the lower jaw. There is one pair of maxillary barbels and two mental. The dorsal and pectoral fin spines are strong and pungent. These fish have a silvery-grey dorsal surface and a whitish or slightly yellowish ventral surface. The barbels are usually dark. Unpaired fins are usually strongly pigmented with melanophores, while paired fins are less strongly pigmented. Ecology Species of Parapimelodus have extremely long gill rakers and more than 55 gill rakers on the first branchial arch, which is related to feeding on plankton. They also have very large eyes on the sides of the head that can be seen both from above and below, which is related to independence from the bottom in locomotion and feeding; though a common trait in many other catfish, it is rare in Pimelodids. P. valenciennis has a possible greater abundance in lagoons than other catfish. P. nigribarbis is the most abundant species in beam trawling at the Saco de Tapes, Lagoa dos Patos.

Private libraries usually require a subscription or membership to the library (paid or unpaid) and provide services specific to the organization, area or university. Book rentals Historically before the industrial revolution, books were too expensive for commoners to buy, and there were businesses which made profit by renting out books for a fee. Kashi- hon in Japan was one of such businesses. In modern era in developing and developed nations, for-profit book rental services have started to lend physical books, audiobook CDs, e-books, and audiobook MP3s through stores and/or by an online (website) interface after popularization of the World Wide Web. Most book rental companies provide books with doorstep delivery using logistic services. Following the popular Netflix model for video rental, many book companies have applied features such as unlimited rentals, free shipping, and no late fees to their book distribution services.  Book rental models  = Based on rental method = Based on the rental method the book rental companies can be categorized into two subgroups: # Book rental companies having a subscription-based models where a monthly or periodic subscription fee is charged and members can rent a number of books based on the subscription. # Book rental companies taking a fraction of book cost as rent. This is the most prevalent model in textbook and college book renting. = Based on type of book rented = Based on the type of books that the book rental service rents following classification can be done: # Physical or Printed Books. The category can further be subdivided into ## Companies focusing on fiction, non-fiction, and other non-academic books. ## Companies who primarily rent academic, reference, and educational publications. # E-book renters Many companies renting physical books also rent e-books. Since e-book rental distribution rights are totally different from physical books many smaller companies are not able to rent e-books from standard publishers like McGraw-Hill, Pearson, Prentice Hall, Cengage, etc due to the high licensing fees required for rental rights.

Many Muslims accused Rushdie of blasphemy or unbelief and in 1989 the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini of Iran issued a fatwa ordering Muslims to kill Rushdie. Numerous killings, attempted killings, and bombings resulted in response to the novel.Jessica Jacobson. Islam in transition: religion and identity among British Pakistani youth. 1998, page 34 The Iranian government backed the fatwa against Rushdie until 1998, when the succeeding government of Iranian President Mohammad Khatami said it no longer supported the killing of Rushdie. However, the fatwa remains in place. The issue was said to have divided \\"Muslims from Westerners along the fault line of culture,\\"Pipes, 1990, p.133From Fatwa to Jihad: The Rushdie Affair and Its Aftermath By Kenan Malik , introduction, no page numbers and to have pitted a core Western value of freedom of expression‚Äîthat no one \\"should be killed, or face a serious threat of being killed, for what they say or write\\"‚Äîagainst the view of many Muslims that no one should be free to \\"insult and malign Muslims\\" by disparaging the \\"honour of the Prophet\\". English writer Hanif Kureishi called the fatwa \\"one of the most significant events in postwar literary history\\". Background Even before the publication of The Satanic Verses, the books of Salman Rushdie had stoked controversy. Rushdie saw his role as a writer \\"as including the function of antagonist to the state\\".Rushdie, Salman, Jaguar Smile; New York: Viking, 1987, p.50 His second book Midnight's Children angered Indira Gandhi because it seemed to suggest \\"that Mrs. Gandhi was responsible for the death of her husband through neglect\\". His 1983 roman √† clef Shame \\"took an aim on Pakistan, its political characters, its culture and its religion... [It covered] a central episode in Pakistan's internal life, which portrays as a family squabble between Iskander Harappa (Zulfikar Ali Bhutto) and his successor and executioner Raza Hyder (Zia ul-Haq)... 'The Virgin Ironpants'... has been identified as Benazir Bhutto, a Prime Minister of Pakistan\\". Positions Rushdie took as a committed leftist prior to the publication of his book were the source of some controversy. He defended many of those who would later attack him during the controversy. Rushdie forcefully denounced the Shah's government and supported the Islamic Revolution of Iran, at least in its early stages. He condemned the US bombing raid on Tripoli in 1986 but found himself threatened by Libya's leader Muammar al-Gaddafi three years later.Pipes, 1990, p.236 He wrote a book bitterly critical of US foreign policy in general and its war in Nicaragua in particular, for example calling the United States government, \\"the bandit posing as sheriff\\".Rushdie, Jaguar Smile, Viking, 1987 After the Ayatollah's fatwa however, he was accused by the Iranian government of being \\"an inferior CIA agent\\".\\"The book's author is in England but the real supporter is the United States\\" ‚Äì Interior Minister Mohtashemi (IRNA 17 February 1989) \\"An Iranian government statement called Rushdie \\"an inferior CIA agent\\" and referred to the book as a \\"provocative American deed\\"\\". (IRNA 14 February 1989) (Pipes, 1990, p.129) A few years earlier, an official jury appointed by a ministry of the Iranian Islamic government had bestowed an award on the Persian translation of Rushdie's book Shame, which up until then was the only time a government had awarded Rushdie's work a prize. Controversial elements of The Satanic Verses The title The Satanic Verses immediately sparked \\"[V]ehement protest against Rushdie's book\\". The title refers to a legend of the Islamic Prophet Mohammad, when a few verses were supposedly spoken by him as part of the Qur'an, and then withdrawn on the grounds that the devil had sent them to deceive Mohammad into thinking they came from God. These \\"Satanic Verses\\" are said to have been revealed in between verses twenty and twenty-one in surah An-Najim of the Qur'an, and by accounts from Tabari, but are seldom mentioned in the first biography of Mohammad by Ibn Ishaq. The verses also appear in other accounts of the prophet's life. They permitted prayer to three pre-Islamic Meccan goddesses: Al-lƒÅt, Uzza, and ManƒÅt‚Äîa violation of monotheism. The utterance and withdrawal of the so-called Satanic Verses forms an important sub-plot in the novel, which recounts several episodes in the life of Muhammad. The phrase Arab historians and later Muslims used to describe the incident of the withdrawn verses was not \\"Satanic verses\\", but the gharaniq verses; the phrase 'Satanic verses' was unknown to Muslims, and was coined by Western academics specialising in the study of Middle Eastern culture. The story itself is not found in the six Sahih of the sunni or the shiite sources, so much so that Muraghi, in his commentary, says: \\"These traditions are undoubtedly a fabrication of the heretics and foreign hands, and have not been found in any of the authentic books\\". According to Daniel Pipes,Daniel Pipes when attention was drawn to a book with this title, \\"Muslims found [it] incredibly sacrilegious\\", and took it to imply that the book's author claimed that verses of the Qur'an were \\"the work of the Devil\\". According to McRoy (2007), other controversial elements included the use of the name Mahound, said to be a derogatory term for Muhammad used by the English during the Crusades; the use of the term Jahilia, denoting the 'time of ignorance' before Islam, for the holy city of Mecca; the use of the name of the Angel Gibreel (Gabriel) for a film star, of the name of Saladin, the great Muslim hero of the Crusades, for a devil, and the name of Ayesha the wife of Muhammad for a fanatical Indian girl who leads her village on a fatal pilgrimage. Moreover, the brothel of the city of Jahilia was staffed by prostitutes with the same names as Muhammad's wives,Pipes, 1990, p. 65 who are viewed by Muslims as 'the Mothers of all Believers'. Other issues many Muslims have found offensive include Abraham being called a \\"bastard\\" for casting Hagar and Ishmael in the desert; and a character named Salman the Persian who serves as one of the Prophet's scribes, an apparent reference to the story, controversial among Muslims, of a Meccan convert by the name of Ibn Abi Sarh, who left Islam after the Prophet failed to notice small changes he had made in the dictation of the Qur'an.Ibn Abi Sarh Daniel Pipes identified other more general issues in the book likely to have angered pious Muslims: A complaint in the book by one of Mahound's companions: \\"rules about every damn thing, if a man farts, let him turn his face to the wind, a rule about which hand to use for the purpose of cleaning one's behind ...\\", which was said to mix up \\"Islamic law with its opposite and with the author's whimsy\\"; the prophet of Rushdie's novel, as he lies dying, being visited in a dream by the Goddess Al- lƒÅt, on the grounds that this suggested either that she exists or that the prophet thought she did; the angel Gibreel's vision of the Supreme Being in another dream as \\"not abstract in the least. He saw, sitting on the bed, a man of about the same age as himself\\", balding, wearing glasses and \\"seeming to suffer from dandruff\\".Pipes, 1990, p. 67 A complaint by one of the characters about communal violence in India: \\"Fact is, religious faith, which encodes the highest aspirations of human race, is now, in our country, the servant of lowest instincts, and God is the creature of evil\\". The Guardian newspaper published on 14 September 2012 a series of recollections of various British people involved in the controversy. Lisa Appignanesi, ex-president of English PEN, observed \\"Intransigence is never so great as when it feels it has a god on its side.\\" One of the lawyers involved, Geoffrey Robertson QC, rehearsed the arguments and replies made when 13 Muslim barristers had lodged a formal indictment against Rushdie for the crime of blasphemous libel: it was said that God was described in the book as \\"the Destroyer of Man\\", yet he is described as such in the Old Testament and the Book of Revelation, especially of men who are unbelievers or enemies of the Jews; that the book contained criticisms of the prophet Abraham, yet the Islamic, Christian and Jewish traditions themselves see Abraham as not without fault and deserving of criticism; that Rushdie referred to Mohammed as \\"Mahound\\", a conjurer, a magician and a false prophet, yet these remarks are made by a drunken apostate, a character with whom neither reader nor author has any sympathy; that the book insults the wives of the Prophet by having whores use their names, yet the wives are explicitly said to be chaste and the adoption of their names by whores is to symbolise the corruption of the city then being described (perhaps symbolising Mecca in its pre-Islamic state); that the book vilified the companions of the Prophet, calling them \\"bums from Persia\\" and \\"clowns\\", yet the character saying this is a hack poet hired to write propaganda against the Prophet and does not reflect the author's beliefs; that the book criticised Islam for having too many rules and seeking to control every aspect of life, yet while characters in the book do make such remarks these cannot constitute blasphemy since they do not vilify God or the Prophet. Early reaction Before the publication of The Satanic Verses, the publisher received \\"warnings from the publisher's editorial consultant\\" that the book might be controversial. Later, Rushdie would reflect upon the time that the book was about to be published. Speaking to an interviewer, he said, \\"I expected a few mullahs would be offended, call me names, and then I could defend myself in public... I honestly never expected anything like this\\". The Satanic Verses was published by Viking Penguin on 26 September 1988 in the UK, and on 22 February 1989 in the US. Upon its publication the book garnered considerable critical acclaim in the United Kingdom. On 8 November 1988, the work received the Whitbread Award for novel of the year, worth ¬£20,000.Pipes, 1990, p.42 According to one observer, \\"almost all the British book reviewers\\" were unaware of the book's connection to Islam because Rushdie has used the name Mahound instead of Muhammad for his chapter on Islam. =Muslim response and book bannings= After the book was first published in the United Kingdom (in September 1988), there were protests by Muslims that predominantly took place in India and the UK. When the book was published in February 1989 in the United States, it received renewed attention, and worldwide protests began to take a more violent form. In Islamic communities, the novel became instantly controversial, because of what some Muslims considered blasphemous references. Rushdie was accused of misusing freedom of speech.Abdolkarim Soroush's speech in the US, November 2002, Farsi Text, it has been published in Aftab monthly magazine in April 2003 By October 1988, letters and phone calls arrived at Viking Penguin from Muslims, angry with the book and demanding that it be withdrawn. Before the end of the month, the import of the book was banned in India, although possession of the book is not a criminal offence. In November 1988, it was also banned in Bangladesh, Sudan, and South Africa. By December 1988, it was also banned in Sri Lanka. In Britain, on 2 December 1988, 7,000 Muslims in the town of Bolton staged the first ever demonstration against The Satanic Verses. After the Friday prayers, a certain section of the congregation marched from the Deobandi run Zakariyya Jame Masjid to the town centre and then burned the book. The organisers claimed \\"It was a peaceful protest, and we burned the book to try and attract public attention\\".Robin Lustig, Martin Bailey, Simon de Bruxelles and Ian Mather The Guardian newspapers story of events around the Book The City of Bradford gained international attention in January 1989 when some of its members organized a public book-burning of The Satanic Verses, evoking as the journalist Robert Winder recalled \\"images of medieval (not to mention Nazi) intolerance\\".Winder, Robert. Bloody Foreigners: The Story of Immigration to Britain. Abacus, London: 2013: p. 414 In February, when the US edition was published, a new round of reviews and criticism began. March 1989 saw it banned in Kenya, Thailand, Tanzania, Indonesia, and Singapore. The last nation to ban the book was Venezuela, in June 1989. On 12 February 1989, a 10,000-strong protest against Rushdie and the book took place in Islamabad, Pakistan. Six protesters were killed in an attack on the American Cultural Center, and an American Express office was ransacked. Attacks In the United States, the FBI was notified of 78 threats to bookstores in early March 1989, thought to be a small proportion of the total number of threats. B. Dalton bookstore chain received 30 threats in less than three hours. Bombings of book stores included two in Berkeley, California. In New York, the office of a community newspaper, The Riverdale Press, was all but destroyed by firebombs following the publication of an editorial defending the right to read the novel and criticizing the bookstores that pulled it from their shelves. But the United Kingdom was the country where violence against bookstores occurred most often and persisted the longest. Two large bookstores in Charing Cross Road, London, (Collets and Dillons) were bombed on 9 April. In May, explosions went off in the town of High Wycombe and again in London, on Kings Road. Other bombings included one at a large London department store (Liberty's), in connection with the Penguin Bookshop inside the store, and at the Penguin store in York. Unexploded devices were found at Penguin stores in Guildford, Nottingham, and Peterborough. In the United States, it was unavailable in about one-third of bookstores. In many others that carried the book, it was kept under the counter.Pipes, 1990, p.169-171 Fatwa by Ayatollah Khomeini On 14 February, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the Supreme Leader of Iran and one of the most prominent Shi'a Muslim leaders, issued a fatwa calling for the death of Rushdie and his publishers. This created a major international incident that persisted for many years. Broadcast on Iranian radio, the judgment read: Khomeini did not give a legal reasoning for his judgement. It is thought to be based on the ninth chapter of the Qur'an, called At-Tawba, verse 61: \\"Some of them hurt the prophet by saying, 'He is all ears!' Say, 'It is better for you that he listens to you. He believes in God, and trusts the believers. He is a mercy for those among you who believe.' Those who hurt God's messenger have incurred a painful retribution\\". However it was not explained how that chapter could support such a judgement. Over the next few days, Iranian officials offered a bounty of $6 million for killing Rushdie, who was thus forced to live under police protection for the next nine years. On 7 March 1989, the United Kingdom and Iran broke diplomatic relations over the Rushdie controversy.Letter from the Private Secretary, 16 March 1989: quoted in The Rushdie File, p. 120 The Month of Rushdies , Eliot Weinberger. Boston Review, 15 March 1989. Retrieved 29 July 2016. =Rushdie's apology and reaction= Rushdie's apology On 18 February, Iran's President Ali Khamenei (who would later that year succeed Khomeini as Supreme Leader) suggested that if Rushdie \\"apologises and disowns the book, people may forgive him\\".from Moin, Khomeini, (2001), p.284, (Issued 18 February, Obtained by Baqer Moin from the Archbishop of Canterbury's aides.)] Following this, Rushdie issued \\"a carefully worded statement\\", saying: > I recognize that Muslims in many parts of the world are genuinely distressed > by the publication of my novel. I profoundly regret the distress the > publication has occasioned to the sincere followers of Islam. Living as we > do in a world of many faiths, this experience has served to remind us that > we must all be conscious of the sensibilities of others. This was relayed to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Tehran \\"via official channels\\" before being released to the press. Rejection of Rushdie's apology On 19 February 1990, Ayatollah Khomeini's office replied: The Imam added: > If a non-Muslim becomes aware of Rushdie's whereabouts and has the ability > to execute him quicker than Muslims, it is incumbent on Muslims to pay a > reward or a fee in return for this action.Moin, Khomeini, (2001), p.284 McRoy (2007) stated that Khomeini's interpretation of the Islamic law that led him to refuse the apology follows the same line of reasoning as Al-Shafi'i (9th century jurist), who in his Risala (Maliki Manual 37.19 Crimes Against Islam) ruled that an \\"apostate is also killed unless he repents... Whoever abuses the Messenger of God ... is to be executed, and his repentance is not accepted\\". =Support for Khomeini's fatwa= In Britain, the Union of Islamic Students' Associations in Europe issued a statement offering its services to Khomeini. Despite incitement to murder being illegal in the United Kingdom,Pipes, 1990, p.182-3 one London property developer told reporters, \\"If I see him, I will kill him straight away. Take my name and address. One day I will kill him\\".Newsweek, 27 February 1989 Other leaders, while supporting the fatwa, claimed that British Muslims were not allowed to carry out the fatwa themselves. Prominent amongst these were the Muslim Parliament and its leader Kalim Siddiqui, and after his death in 1996, his successor, Ghayasuddin Siddiqui. His support for the fatwa continued, even after the Iranian leadership said it would not pursue the fatwa, and re-iterated his support in 2000.The Independent, 13 February 2000 Meanwhile, in America, the director of the Near East Studies Center at UCLA, George Sabbagh, told an interviewer that Khomeini was \\"completely within his rights\\" to call for Rushdie's death.TIME, 27 February 1989, p.159 In May 1989 in Beirut, Lebanon, British citizen Jackie Mann was abducted \\"in response to Iran's fatwa against Salman Rushdie for the publication of The Satanic Verses and more specifically, for his refuge and protection in the United Kingdom\\".Ranstorp, Hizb'allah in Lebanon, (1997), p.103 He joined several Westerners held hostage there. Two months earlier a photograph of three teachers held hostage was released by Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine with the message that it \\"would take revenge against\\" all institutions and organisations that insulted in one way or another \\"members of the Prophet Mohammed's family\\".\\"Iran: West to Blame Islam for Forthcoming Terrorism\\", Philadelphia Inquirer, 24 February 1989, p.5A McRoy (2007) claimed that \\"In Islamic society a blasphemer is held in the same hostile contempt as a pedophile in the West. Just as few if any people in the West mourn the murder of a child molester, few Muslims mourn the killing of a blasphemer\\". =Criticism of Khomeini's fatwa= Khomeini's fatwa was condemned across the Western world by governments on the grounds that it violated the universal human rights of free speech, freedom of religion, and that Khomeini had no right to condemn to death a citizen of another country living in that country. The twelve members of the European Economic Community removed their ambassadors from Tehran for three weeks. On Islamic grounds In addition to criticism of the death sentence on the basis of human rights, the sentence was also criticised on Islamic grounds. According to Bernard Lewis, a death warrant without trial, defence and other legal aspects of sharia violates Islamic jurisprudence. In Islamic fiqh, apostasy by a mentally sound adult male is indeed a capital crime. However, fiqh also: > ... lays down procedures according to which a person accused of an offense > is to be brought to trial, confronted with his accuser, and given the > opportunity to defend himself. A judge will then give a verdict and if he > finds the accused guilty, pronounce sentence... Even the most rigorous and > extreme of the classical jurist only require a Muslim to kill anyone who > insults the Prophet in his hearing and in his presence. They say nothing > about a hired killing for a reported insult in a distant country.Bernard > Lewis commenting on Rushdie fatwa in The Crisis of Islam : Holy War and > Unholy Terror, 2003 by Bernard Lewis, p.141-2 Other Islamic scholars outside Iran took issue with the fact that the sentence was not passed by an Islamic court, or that it did not limit its \\"jurisdiction only [to] countries under Islamic law\\". Muhammad Hussan ad-Din, a theologian at Al-Azhar University, argued \\"Blood must not be shed except after a trial [when the accused has been] given a chance to defend himself and repent\\". Abdallah al-Mushidd, head of Azhar's FatwƒÅ Council stated \\"We must try the author in a legal fashion as Islam does not accept killing as a legal instrument\\".\\"Ab'ad Harb al-Kitab\\" Al Majalla, 1 March 1989, quoted in Pipes, 1990, p.93 The Islamic Jurisprudence Academy in Mecca urged that Rushdie be tried and, if found guilty, be given a chance to repent, (p. 93) and Ayatollah Mehdi Rohani, head of the Shi'i community in Europe and a cousin of Khomeini, criticised Khomeini for 'respect[ing] neither international law nor that of Islam.'Le Nouvel Observateur 23 February 1989 There was also criticism of the fatwa issued against Rushdie's publishers. According to Daniel Pipes: \\"The Sharia clearly establishes that disseminating false information is not the same as expressing it. \\"Transmitting blasphemy is not blasphemy\\" (naql al-kufr laysa kufr). In addition, the publishers were not Muslim and so could not be \\"sentenced under the Islamic laws of apostasy\\". If there was another legal justification for sentencing them to death, \\"Khomeini failed to provide\\" it.Pipes, 1990, p.91 Iran's response to calls for a trial was to denounce its Islamic proponents as \\"deceitful\\". President Khomeini accused them of attempting to use religious law as \\"a flag under which they can crush revolutionary Islam\\".Radio Tehran, 16 March 1989, quoted in Pipes, 1990, p. 135 Questions of political motivation Some speculate that the fatwa (or at least the reaffirmation of the death threat four days later) was issued with motives other than a sense of duty to protect Islam by punishing blasphemy/apostasy. Namely: *To divide Muslims from the West by \\"starkly highlight[ing] the conflicting political and intellectual traditions\\" of the two civilisations. Khomeini had often warned Muslims of the dangers of the West ‚Äì \\"the agents of imperialism [who] are busy in every corner of the Islamic world drawing our youth away from us with their evil propaganda\\".Khomeini, Islam and Revolution (1980), p.127 He knew from news reports the book was already rousing the anger of Muslims. *To distract the attention of his Iranian countrymen from his capitulation seven months earlier to a truce with Iraq (20 July 1988) ending the long and bloody Iran‚ÄìIraq War (a truce Iraq would have eagerly given him six years and hundreds of thousands of lives earlier),Moin, Baqer, Khomeini, (2001), p.267,The Gulf War : Its Origins, History and Consequences by John Bulloch and Harvey Morris, 1989, (p.xvi)] and strengthen the revolutionary ardour and moralePeople of the Century, by CBS News, p.220. of Iranians worn down by the bloodshed and privation of that war. According to journalist Robin Wright, \\"as the international furore grew, Khomeini declared that the book had been a 'godsend' that had helped Iran out of a 'na√Øve foreign policy'\\".Wright, Robin In the Name of God, (c1989), p.201 *To win back the interest in and support for the Islamic Revolution among the 90% of the population of the Muslim world that was Sunni, rather than Shia like Khomeini. The Iran‚ÄìIraq War had also alienated Sunni, who not only were offended by its bloodshed, but tended to favour Iran's Sunni-led opponent, Iraq. At least one observer speculated that Khomeini's choice of the issue of disrespect for the Prophet Muhammad was a particularly shrewd tactic, as Sunni were inclined to suspect Shia of being more interested in the Imams Ali and Husayn ibn Ali than in the Prophet.Pipes, 1990, 133‚Äì4 *To steal the thunder of Khomeini's two least favourite enemy states, Saudi Arabia and the United States, who were basking in the glory of the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan. This withdrawal, seen by many as a great victory of Islamic faith over an atheist superpower, was made possible by billions of dollars in aid to the Afghan mujahideen by those two countries. Khomeini issued the fatwa on 14 February 1989. The next day came the official announcement of the completion of the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, lost in the news cycle of the fatwa.Kepel, Jihad, (2001), p. 135 *To gain the upper hand from Saudi Arabia in the struggle for international leadership of the Muslim world. Each led rival blocs of international institutions and media networks, and \\"the Saudi government, it should be remembered, had led the anti-Rushdie campaign for months\\". Unlike the more conservative Saudi Arabia, however, Iran was ideologically and militantly anti-western and could take a more militant stand outside international law. Questions of personal motivation Despite claims by Iranian officials that \\"Rushdie's book did not insult Iran or Iranian leaders\\" and so they had no selfish personal motivation to attack the book, the book does include an eleven-page sketch of Khomeini's stay in Paris that could well be considered an insult to him. It describes him as having \\"grown monstrous, lying in the palace forecourt with his mouth yawning open at the gates; as the people march through the gates he swallows them whole\\". In the words of one observer, \\"If this is not an insult, Khomeini was far more tolerant than one might suppose\\",Pipes, 1990, p.207 John Crowley has noted that the section of the book depicting the Khomeini-like character was selected to be read publicly by Rushdie in the promotional events leading up to and following the book's release. In Crowley's opinion, the fatwa was most likely declared because of this section of the novel and its public exposure, rather than the overall parodic treatment of Islam. =Attempts to revoke the fatwa= On 24 September 1998, as a precondition to the restoration of diplomatic relations with Britain, the Iranian government, then headed by reformist Muhammad Khatami, gave a public commitment that it would \\"neither support nor hinder assassination operations on Rushdie\\". However, some in Iran have continued to reaffirm the death sentence. In early 2005, Khomeini's fatwa was reaffirmed by Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in a message to Muslim pilgrims making the annual pilgrimage to Mecca. Additionally, the Revolutionary Guards have declared that the death sentence on him is still valid. Iran has rejected requests to withdraw the fatwa on the basis that only the person who issued it may withdraw it, with Ruhollah Khomeini having died in 1989. On 14 February 2006, the Iranian state news agency reported that the fatwa will remain in place permanently. In 2007, Salman Rushdie reported that he still receives a \\"sort of Valentine's card\\" from Iran each year on 14 February letting him know the country has not forgotten the vow to kill him. He was also quoted saying, \\"It's reached the point where it's a piece of rhetoric rather than a real threat\\". Social and political fallout One of the immediate consequences of the fatwa was a worsening of Islamic-Western relations. =Heightened tension= Rushdie lamented that the controversy fed the Western stereotype of \\"the backward, cruel, rigid Muslim, burning books and threatening to kill the blasphemer\\",Marzorati, Gerald, \\"Salman Rushdie: Fiction's Embattled Infidel\\", The New York Times Magazine, 29 January 1989 while another British writer compared the Ayatollah Khomeini \\"with a familiar ghost from the past ‚Äì one of those villainous Muslim clerics, a Faqir of Ipi or a mad Mullah, who used to be portrayed, larger than life, in popular histories of the British Empire\\".Anthony Harly, \\"Saving Mr. Rushdie?\\" Encounter, June 1989, p. 74 Media expressions of this included a banner headline in the popular British newspaper the Daily Mirror referring to Khomeini as \\"that Mad Mullah\\".15 February 1989 The Independent newspaper worried that Muslim book burning demonstrations were \\"following the example of the Inquisition and Hitler's National Socialists\\",The Independent, 16 March 1989 and that if Rushdie was killed, \\"it would be the first burning of a heretic in Europe in two centuries\\".League for the Spread of Unpopular Views. West German organization, Bund zur Verbreitung unerwunschter Einsichten [Hamburg], \\"Der Fall Rushdie und die Feigheit des Westerns,\\" pamphlet, p. 3. quoted in Pipes 1990, p.250 Peregrine Worsthorne of The Sunday Telegraph feared that with Europe's growing Muslim population, \\"Islamic fundamentalism is rapidly growing into a much bigger threat of violence and intolerance than anything emanating from, say, the fascist National Front; and a threat, moreover, infinitely more difficult to contain since it is virtually impossible to monitor, let alone stamp out ...\\".Peregrine Worsthorne, \\"The Blooding of the Literati\\", The Sunday Telegraph, 19 February 1989 On the Muslim side, the Iranian government saw the book as part of a British conspiracy against Islam. It broke diplomatic relations with UK on 7 March 1989 giving the explanation that \\"in the past two centuries Britain has been in the frontline of plots and treachery against Islam and Muslims\\", It accused the British of sponsoring Rushdie's book to use it as a political and cultural tact on earlier military plots that no longer worked.Islamic Revolution News Agency, 7 March 1989 It also saw itself as the victor of the controversy, with the European Community countries capitulating under Iranian pressure. \\"When Europeans saw that their economic interests in Muslim countries could be damaged, they began to correct their position on the issue of the insulting book. Every official started to condemn the book in one way or another. When they realised that Iran's reaction, its breaking of diplomatic relations with London, could also include them, they quickly sent back their ambassadors to Tehran to prevent further Iranian reaction\\".Kayhan Havai, 18 April 1989 =Book sales= Persian Samizdat edition of Salman Rushdie's Satanic Verses c.2000 Although British bookseller W.H. Smith sold \\"a mere hundred copies a week of the book in mid-January 1989\\", it \\"flew off the shelves\\" following the fatwa. In America it sold an \\"unprecedented\\" five times more copies than the number two book, Star by Danielle Steel, selling more than 750,000 copies of the book by May 1989. B. Dalton, a bookstore chain that decided not to stock the book for security reasons, changed its mind when it found the book \\"was selling so fast that even as we tried to stop it, it was flying off the shelves\\".Len Riggioi quoted in Publishers Weekly, 10 March 1989Pipes, 1990, p.200-1 Rushdie earned about $2 million within the first year of the book's publication,Pipes, 1990, p.205 and the book is Viking's all-time best seller. =Rushdie= The author of the book himself was not killed or injured as many militants wished, but visibly frustrated by a life locked in 24-hour armed guard ‚Äì alternately defiant against his would-be killers and attempting overtures of reconciliation against the death threat. A week after the death threat, and after his unsuccessful apology to the Iranian government, Rushdie described succumbing to \\"a curious lethargy, the soporific torpor that overcomes ... while under attack\\";Salman Rushdie, \\"Beginning of a Novelist's Thralldom\\" The Observer, 26 February 1989 then, a couple of weeks after that, wrote a poem vowing \\"not to shut up\\" but \\"to sing on, in spite of attacks\\".6 March 1989 published in Granta, Autumn 1989 But in June, following the death of Khomeini, he asked his supporters \\"to tone down their criticism of Iran\\". His wife, Marianne Wiggins, reported that in the first few months following the fatwa the couple moved 56 times, once every three days. In late July Rushdie separated from Wiggins, \\"the tension of being at the centre of an international controversy, and the irritations of spending all hours of the day together in seclusion\\", being too much for their \\"shaky\\" relationship.Pipes, 1990, p.203 Late the next year Rushdie declared, \\"I want to reclaim my life\\", and in December signed a declaration \\"affirming his Islamic faith and calling for Viking-Penguin, the publisher of The Satanic Verses, neither to issue the book in paperback nor to allow it to be translated\\". This also failed to move supporters of the fatwa and by mid-2005 Rushdie was condemning Islamic fundamentalism as a > ... project of tyranny and unreason which wishes to freeze a certain view of > Islamic culture in time and silence the progressive voices in the Muslim > world calling for a free and prosperous future. ... along comes 9/11, and > now many people say that, in hindsight, the fatwa was the prologue and this > is the main event. A memoir of his years of hiding, titled Joseph Anton, was published on 18 September 2012. Joseph Anton was Rushdie's secret alias. =Explanation of different reactions= Muslim The passionate international rage of Muslims towards the book surprised many Western readers because the book was written in English, not Arabic, Urdu, Persian or other languages for which the majority of mother tongue speakers are Muslims; it was never published or even sold in the countries where most Muslims lived; and was a work of fiction‚Äîa demanding, densely written novel unlikely to appeal to the average reader.Pipes, 1990, p.85 Some of the explanations for the unprecedented rage unleashed against the book were that: *The Satanic Verses was seen as a continuation of the long tradition of anti-Islamic sentiment in Western literature, portraying the core subject matter of the Prophet Muhammad and Islam in a derogatory mannerMis/Representations of Islam: Reading Salman Rushdie's The Satanic Verses, By Ismail Isa Patel London 1998 *Rushdie was living in the West and ought to be setting a good example for Islam and not siding \\"with the Orientalists\\".Syed Ali Ashraf, writing in Impact International, 28 October 1988 *The view of many Muslims was that \\"Rushdie has portrayed the prophet of Islam as a brothel keeper\\".ad by the Birmingham Central Mosque in British newspapers \\"Rushdie accuses the prophet, particularly Muhammad of being like prostitutes\\".Dawud Assad, president of the U.S. Council of Masajid quoted in Trenton Times, 21 February 1989 \\"all who pray are sons of whores\\"a young French Muslim quoted in Le Nouvel Observateur, 23 March 1989 \\"The Prophet's wives are portrayed as women of the street, his homes as a public brothel and his companions as bandits\\".M. Rafiqul Islam, The Rushdie Affair: A Conflict of Rights unpublished manuscript, April 1989, p.3 The book, in fact, portrays prostitutes who \\"had each assumed the identity of one of Mahound's wives\\".Salman Rushdie, The Satanic Verses, Random House, 1988, p. 393 *Belief that fictional elements of the novel were not flights of imagination but lies. Complaints included that it was \\"neither a critical appraisal nor a piece of historical research\\",Mir Husayn Musavi, prime minister of Iran, quoted on Radio Tehran 21 February 1989 that the novel failed to rely on \\"scientific and logical arguments\\",(Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah, Agence France Press, 27 February 1989) its \\"lack of scientific, accurate or objective methods of research\\",(Shaykh Ahmad Kaftaru, mufti of the Syrian Arab Republic, source: Syrian Arab News Agency, 1 March 1989 \\"unfounded lies\\", not being \\"serious or scientific\\",Religious affairs director of Turkish government, Mustafa Sait Yazicioglu, Radio Ankara 14 March 1989 \\"a total distortion of historical facts\\",Sayed M.

The belief among many Muslims in or from the Middle East is that every country \\"has ... laws that prohibits any publications or utterances that tend to ridicule or defame Islam\\".editorial in The Jordan Times, 5 March 1989] It followed that permission to publish a book that ridiculed or defamed Islam showed an anti- Islamic bias in those countries that permit publication. Although not enforced, and abolished completely in 2008, the United Kingdom had laws prohibiting blasphemy against the Christian religion. *The view of many Muslims that Britain, America and other Western countries are engaged in a war against Islam and what might on the surface appear to be the product of the imagination of an individual iconoclast author was actually a conspiracy on a national or transnational scale. Then Iranian president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, for example, explained the alleged historical roots of the Rushdie book in a broadcast on Radio Tehran: > Whoever is familiar with the history of colonialism and the Islamic world > knows that whenever they wanted to get a foothold in a place, the first > thing they did in order to clear their paths ‚Äì whether overtly or covertly ‚Äì > was to undermine the people's genuine Islamic morals.broadcast Radio Tehran, > 7 March 1989 quoted in Pipes, 1990, p.124-5 and claimed an unnamed British > foreign secretary once told the British parliament, \\"So long as the Qur'an > is revered by Muslims, we will not be able to consolidate a foothold among > the Muslims\\". *A campaign by the international Islamist group Jamaat-e-Islami in retaliation for Rushdie's satire of them in the earlier book Shame. In Britain the group was represented by the UK Action Committee on Islamic Affairs.From Fatwa to Jihad: The Rushdie Affair and Its Aftermath By Kenan Malik , chapter one, (no page numbers) *Among second generation Muslim immigrants in UK and elsewhere, a decline in interest in universalist \\"white Left\\" anti-racist/anti-imperialist politics, and rise in identity politics with its focus on the \\"defence of values and beliefs\\" of Muslim identity.From Fatwa to Jihad: The Rushdie Affair and Its Aftermath By Kenan Malik , introduction, part 5, no page numbers *Based on the book's title, and out of a general ignorance about what it references, a misunderstanding in the part of people in Muslim majority countries, where the book was not available, that led to the belief that the book was a \\"Satanist\\" critique of Islam and the Prophet Muhammad. Western mainstream Despite the passionate intensity of Muslim feeling on the issue no Western government banned The Satanic Verses. This is primarily because most Western governments explicitly or implicitly allow for freedom of expression, which includes forbidding censorship in the vast majority of cases. Western attitudes regarding freedom of expression differ from those in the Arab world because: *Westerners are less likely to be shocked by ridicule of religious figures. \\"Taboo and sacrilege are virtually dead in the West. Blasphemy is an old story and can no longer shock\\".Pipes, 1990 p.108 Examples of movies and books that aroused little or no protest in the west despite their blasphemy: Joseph Heller's God Knows, which turned \\"Biblical stories into pornographic fare\\";Pipes, 1990 p.108, 118‚Äì9 Even The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, a book that was not only offensive and untrue but arguably very dangerous, having inspired the killing of Jews in Russia and contributed to Nazi ideology, was \\"freely available in the west\\". *The idea widely accepted among writers that provocation in literature is not a right but is a duty, an important calling: \\"it is perhaps in the nature of modern art to be offensive ... in this century if we are not willing to risk giving offence, we have no claim to the title of artists\\".John Updike, The Wall Street Journal, 10 August 1989 Rushdie himself said: \\"I had spent my entire life as a writer in opposition, and indeed conceived the writer's role as including the function of antagonist to the state\\".Rushdie, Salman, Jaguar Smile, p.50 The last point also explains why one of the few groups to speak out in Muslim countries against Khomeini and for Rushdie's right to publish his book were other writers.\\"The Importance of Being Earnest About Salman Rushdie\\" by Sadeq al-'Azm, in M.D. Fletcher, Reading Rushdie: Perspectives on the Fiction of Salman Rushdie, Amsterdam, Rodopi B.V., 1994 Nobel prize winners Wole Soyinka of Nigeria and Naguib Mahfouz of Egypt, both attacked Khomeini, and both received death threats as a result, with Mahfouz later getting stabbed in the neck by a Muslim fundamentalist.Pipes, 1990, p.148, 175 Some Western politicians and writers did criticise Rushdie. Former United States president Jimmy Carter, while condemning the threats and fatwa against Rushdie, stated, \\"we have tended to promote him and his book with little acknowledgment that it is a direct insult to those millions of Moslems whose sacred beliefs have been violated and are suffering in restrained silence the added embarrassment of the Ayatollah's irresponsibility\\". He also held that Rushdie must have been aware of the response his book would evoke: \\"The author, a well-versed analyst of Moslem beliefs, must have anticipated a horrified reaction throughout the Islamic world\\".\\"International Herald Tribune\\", 4 July 2007 He saw a need to be \\"sensitive to the concern and anger\\" of Muslims and thought severing diplomatic relations with Iran would be an \\"overreaction\\".Jimmy Carter, \\"Rushdie's Book Is an Insult\\", The New York Times, 5 March 1989 Among authors, Roald Dahl was scathing and called Rushdie's book sensationalist and Rushdie \\"a dangerous opportunist\\". John le Carr√© thought the death sentence to be outrageous, but he also criticised Rushdie's action: \\"I don't think it is given to any of us to be impertinent to great religions with impunity\\", although he later expressed regret over his dispute with Rushdie. Rushdie, however, was supported by major bodies in the literary world such as PEN and Association of American Publishers, and prominent figures such as G√ºnter Grass, Martin Amis, Saul Bellow, Nadine Gordimer and Derek Walcott. Another major supporter of Rushdie, Christopher Hitchens, said that the fatwa persuaded him that Islamic fundamentalism was an urgent menace, and later wrote God Is Not Great, a polemic against religion. The affair however led to greater caution and some degree of self-censorship when dealing with Islamic issues in the literary and other creative arts. Western religious figures Many religious figures in the United States and United Kingdom shared the aversion to blasphemy of pious Muslims (if not as intensely) and did not defend Rushdie like their secular compatriots. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Robert Runcie, demanded that the government expand the Blasphemy Act to cover other religions, including Islam. Michael Walzer wrote that the response revealed an evolution of the meaning of blasphemy; it moved away from a crime against God and toward something more temporal. > Today we are concerned for our pain and sometimes, for other people's. > Blasphemy has become an offence against the faithful ‚Äì in much the same way > as pornography is an offence against the innocent and the virtuous.

Sea pineapples are known for both their peculiar appearance, described by journalist Nick Tosches as \\"something that could exist only in a purely hallucinatory eco-system\\" and their peculiar taste, described as \\"something like iodine\\" and \\"rubber dipped in ammonia\\". However, aficionados claim that the taste is well suited to serving with sake. The flavor has been attributed to an unsaturated alcohol called cynthiaol, which is present in minute quantities. Sea pineapples live in shallow water, usually attached to rocks and artificial structures, an example of marine biofouling. Halocynthia roretzi is adapted to cold water: it can survive in water temperatures between , but optimum temperature is around . Aquaculture of sea pineapples first succeeded in 1982, when 39 metric tons were produced in Korea. Production reached a peak of 42,800 tons in 1994. The FAO estimates that total world sea pineapple production in 2006 was 21,500 tons, worth around US$18 million. Of this, 16,000 tons were cultivated in Japan, including 12,163 tons in Miyagi prefecture alone.  Culinary uses  In Korea, sea pineapple is mostly eaten raw as hoe with vinegared gochujang, but it is also often pickled into jeotgal, or used to add flavor to kimchi. In Japan, sea pineapple is most commonly eaten raw as sashimi, simply by slicing the animal vertically, removing the internal organs and serving them with vinegared soy sauce.

Hudson released the game on January 9, 2008.Joystiq Omega Five article Various Japanese sites including Famitsu had listed Omega Five as also heading to the Nintendo 3DS in Spring 2011.OMEGA FIVEÔºà„Ç™„É°„Ç¨„Éï„Ç°„Ç§„ÉñÔºâÔºà‰ªÆÈ°åÔºâ„ÅÆ„É¨„Éì„É•„Éº„ÄÅÊúÄÊñ∞ÊÉÖÂ†± / „Éï„Ç°„ÉüÈÄö.com However, the 3DS port was canceled shortly following Konami's acquisition of Hudson, along with the company's other planned 3DS titles. Omega Five features four selectable flying characters shooting enemies in a horizontally scrolling environment, with enemies emerging from the 3D background as well as screen edges, using both ranged and melee attacks. Each character can pick up icons to choose from one of three attack types, A, B, or C, and each weapon can be upgraded three times. Characters *Ruby is a lingerie-clad female with three attacks, as well as a satellite that can lock on to enemies and damage them. In addition, Ruby will auto-aim at an enemy the satellite has latched to. Her A-type weapon is Vulcan Cannon, gaining power and spread with upgrades. B-type is Laser Beam, which at full power will reflect off surfaces, allowing it to hit around corners. C-type is Lightning Gun, which at top strength shoots off sparks that damage nearby enemies as well as the target. *Tempest is a brawny four-armed alien, though he only carries a weapon in one hand. Instead of a satellite, he has an alternate attack for each of his weapons. Tempest's weapons eschew typical shoot 'em up weapons like vulcan/laser/missiles, instead they provide one of Omega Five's most novel touches. A-type is Volcanic Fire, a flamethrower that gains power and length when powered up. Its alternate attack is a lock-on that will allow it to curve around obstacles to hit the enemy. B-type is Corrosive Acid, which resembles a fire hose, and can be changed between a tight flow and a wide spout. C-Type is Molten Metal, which bursts in arcs causing heavy damage. For its alternate attack, Tempest spins and fires homing bursts from all four arms at once. In addition to his unique alien weaponry, Tempest features a bullet reflecting shield. As bullets approach him, the shield slows them and turns them green. If the player stops firing briefly, all the slowed bullets reflect back at the enemy. *R.A.D becomes selectable by beating the game with Ruby, and she is basically Ruby's faster twin. Although her movement is faster than Ruby, her aiming is slower. Also, when her satellite locks on to enemies, R.A.D. is free to attack other foes instead of being locked on. *Sensei is unlocked by beating the game with Tempest. He is a skinny old samurai riding a flying sled with his warrior dog Rikimaru. Rather than carrying a gun, Sensei swings a sword in whatever direction the player presses. This attack is probably the most potent in the game - besides dealing great damage to enemies, it can hit through walls, and it destroys bullets fired at the player. The drawback is that Sensei must be close to enemies to attack them, but the ferocity of his sword makes up for it. For his alternate attack, Rikimaru flies off and latches onto enemies, and Sensei switches to throwing projectiles that home in on Rikimaru's target. Weapon A is a bomb, weapon B consists of throwing knives, and weapon C is a shuriken. Also, by spinning the aiming stick in a quick circle, Sensei will swing his sword in a circle and hit everything around him. *Rikimaru is the \\"fifth\\" warrior of the Omega Five. Special Attacks *Dimensional Field - hitting right bumper on the 360 controller enables Dimensional Field, where the player temporarily enters another dimension and can move freely without being hit. It uses a small amount of life, and acts as an escape when the player is overwhelmed. *Ultimate Burst - hitting the left trigger releases Ultimate Burst, a bomb that destroys all minor enemies onscreen and greatly damages larger ones. The player gains this ability by collecting p-chips, tiny flying triangles left by defeated enemies. 80 chips equals one Burst, and up to three Bursts can be stored. Audio The original score for Omega Five was composed by long-running Natsume employee Hiroyuki Iwatsuki. Most tracks include two versions: an original theme and retro remix. The latter category of songs were meant to simulate the electronic sound effects of 16-bit videogames and are played during the Retro Mode. An album release for the game had not been planned, until the idea was suggested by game composer Manabu Namiki after listening to the soundtrack prior to the release.

Hartnett joined the team during the 2005 National Hurling League and was a regular member of the team until he left the panel after the 2008 championship. During that time he won one All-Ireland medal and two Munster medals as a non-playing substitute. At club level Hartnett has played with Russell Rovers, divisional side Imokilly and University College Cork. Playing career =Club= Hartnett plays hurling with his local club Russell Rovers, who play in the Cork Junior Hurling Championship. He also plays with the University College Cork team in the Cork Senior Hurling Championship. He usually plays on the half-back line or in midfield. =Inter-county= Hartnett first came to prominence on the inter- county scene as a member of the Cork minor hurling team in 2001. He made his debut when he came on as a substitute in a Munster quarter-final defeat of Waterford before later starting at midfield in the provincial decider. Tipperary were the winners by 1-12 to 1-6, however, Cork remained in the championship and reached the All-Ireland final via the back-door. Galway provided the opposition on that occasion, however, a 2-10 to 1-8 score line secured a victory for Cork and an All-Ireland medal for Hartnett. By 2005 Hartnett was a regular member of the Cork under-21 team. After back-to-back defeats by Tipperary in the provincial decider over the previous two years, Cork finally triumphed. A 4-9 to 0-13 victory gave Hartnett a Munster medal in that grade. Hartnett was also called up to the Cork intermediate hurling team. He won a Munster medal in this grade in 2003 following a 2-12 to 0-11 defeat of Waterford. He later lined out in the All-Ireland final with Kilkenny providing the opposition. In a classic game of hurling both sides were still level at the full-time whistle. There was little to separate the sides in a period of extra-time, however, Cork narrowly emerged victorious by 1-21 to 0-23. After being deemed ineligible for the team the following year, Hartnett was back with the intermediate side in 2005. A 2-17 to 2-11 defeat of Tipperary gave him a second Munster medal in that grade. In 2006 Hartnett collected a third Munster medal following a 2-18 to 2-13 defeat of Tipperary. The subsequent All-Ireland decider saw Cork face Kilkenny. A narrow 3-15 to 1-18 victory gave Hartnett a second All-Ireland medal. By this stage Hartnett had already joined the Cork senior team. He made his competitive debut when he came on as a substitute in a National Hurling League game against Waterford in 2005. He was also included on the Cork panel for the subsequent championship campaign and collected a set of Munster and All-Ireland medals as a non- playing substitute. In 2006 Hartnett was also an unused substitute as Cork retained the Munster crown but were later defeated by Kilkenny in the All- Ireland decider. Hartnett made his championship debut when he came on as a substitute in an ill-tempered Munster quarter-final defeat of Clare in 2007. Due to the suspensions of Donal √ìg Cusack, Diarmuid O'Sullivan and Se√°n √ìg √ì hAilp√≠n following that game, Hartnett was handed his first championship start for the subsequent Munster semi-final.

The village has an average elevation of and is located approximately from Sirsaganj. A bypass road for National Highway No.2 passes near the village, which rests on the banks of the river Aab-Ganga, a watercourse that dried up many years ago. During the past few years, the water supply to the village has been diminishing rapidly and the village is currently suffering from a water shortage. Local leaders hope to bring in trenching machinery to dig irrigation ditches to the nearby Naab- Kajshri river located to the southeast. Other villages near Seengemai include Nagla Nainsukh, Nagla Neewri, Nagla Maharam and Kisraon. Seengemai Gram Panchayat Seengemai Gram Panchayat (the Gram/ Village Panchayat is the basic unit of local self-government) consists of Seengemai village and the two adjacent villages of Nagla Nainsukh and Nagla Newari. This Gram Panchayat currently reserves its Gram Pradhan (also known as the Sarpanch or Village Chieftain) candidature for people belonging to the Thakur in accordance with the directives laid down by the Constitution of India. Transport The nearby town of Sirsaganj serves as a regional center of trade and commerce for the people of Seengemai. Three main roads connect the village to Sirsaganj. These roads are used by trucks, tractors, bullock carts, and other vehicles to transport people, crops, and animals. Since the village has no buses, autos or other public transportation its people rely on tractors, cars, motorcycles, scooters, and bicycles to reach nearby villages and the town. People and culture The village of Seengemai is made up of 425 families, accounting for a total population of 2974, of which 1606 are male and 1368 are female. The female to male ratio of the village is 85:100. The primary religion of the village is Hinduism, with followers of Buddhism and Islam in the minority. Adherents to these three different religions coexist without tension. Seengemai villagers primarily speak Khariboli Hindi (an informal form of Hindi). English is also spoken by the educated village population. The majority of the village is engaged in agriculture, while others are civil servants or businessmen. Ram Nawami Mela Ram Nawami Mela is an annual, traditional, and spiritual feast that is celebrated in Seengemai. The Mela is a vital part of the culture of Seengemai. This feast is celebrated on the occasion of Ram Nawami, generally in the month of April each year. This feast lasts as long as two days. The permanent venue of the Mela is a temple of the avatar of the goddess named Durga. Vendors from nearby towns and villages come to the Mela to sell goods such as snacks, sweets and jhulas, which is the main attraction for viewers of the feast. During the night there is a show of Nautanki, a traditional entertaining art. Sometimes vulgarity and violence are reported in some of these shows. A large reduction in viewers of the Mela has been reported in the last few years. Education Seengemai village has two government-funded schools, one for primary and the other imparting secondary school education. In addition to this, there are a few private schools as well. For higher education, students of Seengemai depend on the nearby municipality of Sirsaganj. The trend of the students, however, have been to follow traditional farming than to attend classes. Infrastructure Seengemai remains under-developed when it comes to public infrastructure. The semi-developed streets that can be found are tiled with clay bricks. Likewise, the public electrification and sewage system are either absent or grossly mismanaged raising health and security concerns. However, one can witness a few government-funded buildings like a local hospital and two schools as well as private buildings in the village.

In 2006 O'Neill was a key member of Bishopstown's top team that faced Carrigtwohill in the final of the premier intermediate championship. A 0-20 to 1-11 victory gave him a Cork Premier Intermediate Hurling Championship medal. =Inter-county= O'Neill first lined out with Cork in the minor grade in 2003. A disappointing season followed, however, in 2004 he won his first Munster medal as Cork ended Tipperary's hopes of four-in-a-row with a 2-13 to 3-8 victory. The following year O'Neill was a key member of the Cork under-21 team. He won a Munster medal in his debut year, as Cork defeated old rivals Tipperary by 4-8 to 0-13. Two years later and O'Neill was appointed captain of the Cork under-21 team. He won a second Munster medal on that occasion following a 1-20 to 0-10 trouncing of Waterford. By 2005 O'Neill's performances for the Cork minor and under-21 teams brought him to the attention of the senior selectors. He was a member of the extended panel during Cork's All-Ireland victory. He won a Munster medal in 2006 as an unused substitute. On 17 June 2007 O'Neill made his senior championship debut in a 5-15 to 3-18 Munster semi-final defeat by Waterford. The following few seasons saw Cork go into decline, however, a highlight for O'Neill was being appointed captain of the team in 2011. O'Neill lined out in his second Munster decider in 2013, however, Cork faced a 0-24 to 0-15 defeat by Limerick. On 8 September 2013 he lined out against Clare in his first All-Ireland final. Three second- half goals through Conor Lehane, Anthony Nash and Pa Cronin, and a tenth point of the game from Patrick Horgan gave Cork a one-point lead as injury time came to an end. A last-gasp point from corner-back Domhnall O'Donovan earned Clare a 0-25 to 3-16 draw. The replay on 28 September was regarded as one of the best in recent years. Clare's Shane O'Donnell was a late addition to the team, and went on to score a hat-trick of goals in the first nineteen minutes of the game. Patrick Horgan top scored for Cork, however, further goals from Conor McGrath and Darach Honan secured a 5-16 to 3-16 victory for Clare. In 2014 O'Neill won his first Munster medal on the field of play as goals by S√©amus Harnedy and Paudie O'Sullivan gave Cork a 2-24 to 0-24 victory over Limerick. =Inter-provincial= O'Neill also had the honour of being picked for Munster in the inter-provincial series of games. He won an Interprovincial Championship medal in 2013 as Munster defeated Connacht by 1-22 to 0-15.

The two largest waves of deportations occurred in June 1941 and March 1949 simultaneously in all three Baltic states (Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania). The deportations targeted various categories of anti-Soviet elements and \\"enemies of the people\\": nationalists (i.e. political elite, military officers, policemen of independent Estonia), Forest Brothers, kulaks, and others. There were deportations based on nationality (Germans in 1945 and Ingrian Finns in 1947‚Äì1950) and religion (Jehovah's Witnesses in 1951). Estonians residing in the Leningrad Oblast had already been subjected to deportation since 1935.The Oxford Handbook of Genocide Studies Oxford University Press Inc. 2010; retrieved 9 May 2013. People were deported to remote areas of the Soviet Union, predominantly to Siberia and northern Kazakhstan, by means of railroad cattle cars. Entire families, including children and the elderly, were deported without trial or prior announcement. Of March 1949 deportees, over 70% of people were women and children under the age of 16. The Estonian Internal Security Service has brought to justice several past organizers of these events. The deportations have been repeatedly declared to constitute a crime against humanity by the Parliament of Estonia and acknowledged as such by the European Court of Human Rights. June deportation of 1941 Exhibition of vehicles similar to these that were used for deporting people to Siberia in 1941. In Estonia, as well as in other territories annexed by the Soviet Union in 1939‚Äì40, the first large-scale deportation of ordinary citizens was carried out by the local operational headquarters of the NKGB of the Estonian SSR under Boris Kumm (chairman), Andres Murro, Aleksei Shkurin, Veniamin Gulst, and Rudolf James, according to the top secret joint decree No 1299-526ss \\"Directive on the Deportation of the Socially Alien Element from the Baltic Republics, Western Ukraine, Western Belarus and Moldavia'\\"–ü–æ—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ –¶–ö –í–ö–ü(–±) –∏ –°–ù–ö –°–°–°–† –æ—Ç 14 –º–∞—è 1941 –≥. –∑–∞ N 1299-526—Å—Å ¬´–î–∏—Ä–µ–∫—Ç–∏–≤–∞ –æ –≤—ã—Å–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏–∏ —Å–æ—Ü–∏–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ-—á—É–∂–¥–æ–≥–æ —ç–ª–µ–º–µ–Ω—Ç–∞ –∏–∑ —Ä–µ—Å–ø—É–±–ª–∏–∫ –ü—Ä–∏–±–∞–ª—Ç–∏–∫–∏, –ó–∞–ø–∞–¥–Ω–æ–π –£–∫—Ä–∞–∏–Ω—ã –∏ –ó–∞–ø–∞–¥–Ω–æ–π –ë–µ–ª–æ—Ä—É—Å—Å–∏–∏ –∏ –ú–æ–ª–¥–∞–≤–∏–∏¬ª.

The deportation procedure was established by the Serov Instructions. The first repressions in Estonia affected Estonia's national elite. On 17 July 1940, Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces Johan Laidoner (died 1953, Vladimir prison) and his family, and on 30 July 1940, President Konstantin P√§ts (died 1956, Kalinin Oblast) and his family were deported to Penza and Ufa, respectively. In 1941 they were arrested. The country political and military leadership was deported almost entirely, including 10 of 11 ministers and 68 of 120 members of parliament. On 14 June 1941, and the following two days, 9,254 to 10,861 people, mostly urban residents, of them over 5,000 women and over 2,500 children under 16,Kareda, Endel (1949).

Three hundred were shot. Only 4,331 persons returned to Estonia. 11,102 people were to be deported from Estonia according to the order of 13 June but some managed to escape. Identical deportations were carried out in Latvia and Lithuania at the same time. A few weeks later, approximately 1,000 people were arrested on Saaremaa for deportation, but this was interrupted as Nazi Germany launched a large-scale invasion of the Soviet Union and a considerable part of the prisoners were freed by the advancing German forces. The first wave of deportation has always been well documented, as many witnesses were subsequently able to flee abroad during the Second World War. Deportations after 1944 were, however, much harder to document. In July 1941 Estonia was conquered by Nazi Germany, who were forced out by advancing Soviet troops in 1944. As soon as the Soviets had returned the deportations resumed. In August 1945, 407 persons, most of them of German descent, were transferred from Estonia to Perm Oblast. 18 families (51 persons) were transferred to Tyumen Oblast in October (51 persons), 37 families (87 persons) in November and other 37 families (91 persons) in December 1945 as \\"Traitors\\".Estonia's Occupations Revisited: Accounts of an Era (compiled by Heiki Ahonen).

In the early morning of 25 March 1949, the second major wave of deportation from the Baltic Republics, operation \\"Priboi\\", carried out by MGB began, which was planned to affect 30,000 in Estonia, including peasants. Lieutenant General Pyotr Burmak, commander of the MGB Internal Troops, was in generally charge for the operation. In Estonia the deportations were coordinated by Boris Kumm, Minister of Security of the Estonian SSR, and Major General Ivan Yermolin, MGB representative to Estonia. Over 8,000 managed to escape, but 20,722 (7,500 families, over 2.5 percent of the Estonian population, half of them women, over 6,000 children under the age of 16, and 4,300 men) were sent to Siberia during three days. Slightly more than 10 percent were men of working age. The deported included disabled people, pregnant women, newborns and children separated from their parents. The youngest deportee was one-day-old Virve Eliste from Hiiumaa island, who died a year later in Siberia; the oldest was 95-year-old Maria Raagel. Nine trainloads of people were directed to Novosibirsk Oblast, six to Krasnoyarsk Krai, two to Omsk Oblast, and two to Irkutsk Oblast. Many perished, most have never returned home. This second wave of the large-scale deportations was aimed to facilitate collectivization, which was implemented with great difficulties in the Baltic republics. As a result, by the end of April 1949, half of the remaining individual farmers in Estonia had joined kolkhozes.Misiunas, Romuald J. & Rein Taagepera.Collectivization of Estonian Agriculture Estonica; retrieved 9 May 2013.\\"The Baltic States: Years of Dependence, 1940-1990\\" (1993), estonica.org; retrieved 9 May 2013. From 1948‚Äì50, a number of Ingrian Finns were also deported from Estonian SSR. The last large-scale campaign of deportations from Estonia took place in 1951, when members of prohibited religious groups from the Baltic countries, Moldavia, Western Ukraine and Belarus were subject to forced resettlement. Continuous deportation Outside the main waves, individuals and families were continually deported on smaller scale from the start of the first occupation in 1940 up to the Khrushchev Thaw of 1956 when de-Stalinisation led Soviet Union to switch its tactic of terror from mass repressions to individual repressions. The Soviet deportations only stopped for three years in 1941‚Äì1944 when Estonia was occupied by Nazi Germany (see Occupation of Estonia by Nazi Germany). Estonians' experience with the first year of Soviet occupation, which included the June deportation, led to two significant developments: * It motivated a major wave of refugees leaving Estonia, mostly by ships over the Baltic Sea in late 1944, after the news about Nazi Germany's withdrawal became public. Some 70,000 people are known to have arrived in their destination; an unknown number perished due to the autumn storms and naval warfare.The Estonian State Commission on Examination of the Policies of Repression The White Book (page 30), parliament.ee; accessed 13 December 2016. * It incentivised many Estonians, who had previously been rather skeptical about joining German army (between January 1943 and February 1944, about 4000 people, mostly male, over half of them below 24 years old, i.e. draftable, had fled to FinlandThe Estonian State Commission on Examination of the Policies of Repression The White Book (page 29), parliament.ee; accessed 13 December 2016.) to join the recently created foreign legions of Waffen-SS, to still try to keep Red Army off Estonian soil and thus, avoid a new Soviet occupation. The attempt failed. For an example of such an ethnic foreign legion, see 20th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Estonian). Only in 1956, during Khrushchev Thaw, were some survived deportees allowed to return to Estonia.

The cases were taken to the European Court of Human Rights, the defendants alleging the sentencing was contrary to the prohibition of retroactive application of criminal laws, but on 17 January 2006 the application was declared as \\"obviously baseless\\".Martin Arpo: kommunismiaja kuritegude tee Euroopa Inim√µiguste Kohtuni, postimees.ee, 31 March 2009. * On 30 October 2002, Yury Karpov received an eight-year suspended sentence. On 7 November 2006, Vladimir Kask was sentenced to eight years in prison with three years of probation. Arnold Meri was on trial for his part in the deportations but died in April 2009 before the end of the trial. Charges against Nikolai Zerebtsovi were dropped. =Russia's view= The Russian Federation, the only legal successor state to the Soviet Union, has never recognized the deportations as a crime and has not paid any compensation.Soviet deportations from Estonia in 1940s, Estonia.eu; retrieved 6 May 2013. Moscow has criticized the Baltic prosecutions, calling them revenge, not justice, and complained about the criminals' age.Stalin agent found guilty in Estonia, The Independent, 1 November 2002. In March 2009, Memorial concluded that the deportations were a crime against humanity, but stopped short of declaring them genocide or war crimes. In the opinion of Memorial, interpretation of events in 1949 as genocide is not based upon international law and is unfounded. Investigative committee The Estonian International Commission for Investigation of Crimes Against HumanityEstonian International Commission for Investigation of Crimes Against Humanity, historycommission.ee; accessed 13 December 2016. was established by President Lennart Meri, who himself was a survivor of the 1941 deportation, in October 1998 to investigate crimes against humanity committed in Estonia or against Estonian citizens during the Soviet and Nazi occupation. The commission held its first session in Tallinn in January 1999. Finnish diplomat Max Jakobson was appointed to chair the commission. For neutrality purposes, there are no Estonian citizens among its members. European Parliament The European Parliament issued a resolution condemning crimes against humanity committed by all totalitarian and authoritarian regimes on 2 April 2009. This includes the Soviet deportations from Estonia, which the European Court of Human Rights has held to constitute crimes against humanity.

Description chucks A jig's primary purpose is to provide repeatability, accuracy, and interchangeability in the manufacturing of products.. A jig is often confused with a fixture; a fixture holds the work in a fixed location. A device that does both functions (holding the work and guiding a tool) is called a jig. An example of a jig is when a key is duplicated; the original is used as a jig so the new key can have the same path as the old one. Since the advent of automation and computer numerical controlled (CNC) machines, jigs are often not required because the tool path is digitally programmed and stored in memory. Jigs may be made for reforming plastics. Jigs or templates have been known long before the industrial age. There are many types of jigs, and each one is custom-tailored to do a specific job. Drill jig A drill jig is a type of jig that expedites repetitive hole center location on multiple interchangeable parts by acting as a template to guide the twist drill or other boring device into the precise location of each intended hole center. In metalworking practice, typically a hardened drill bushing lines each hole on the jig plate to keep the tool from damaging the jig. Drill jigs started falling into disuse with the invention of the jig borer. Since the widespread penetration of the manufacturing industry by CNC machine tools, in which servo controls are capable of moving the tool to the correct location automatically, the need for drill jigs (and for the jobs of the drill press operators who used them) is much less than it used to be. PCB jig Printed circuit board (PCB) jigs are used to test PCBs. They have a dump board inside the jig which can find faults in the PCBs. Jewelry jig A jig used in making jewelry, a specific type of jig, is a plate or open frame for holding work and helping to shape jewelry components made out of wire or small sheets of metal. A jig in the jewelry making application is used to help establish a pattern for use in shaping the wire or sheets of metal. In the jewelry application, the shaping of the metal is done by hand or with simple hand tools like a hammer. Knife Sharpening jig A jig used for sharpening knives, a specific type of jig used to hold or aid the sharpening of all types of knives. Knife sharpening jigs hold knives in a fixed position via clamps, etc. and allow for more controlled and precise sharpening angles, resulting in more consistent edges than those sharpened by other methods.

She took part in some of the most famous battles of the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars before she was broken up in 1813. French Revolutionary Wars One of her first engagements was at the Glorious First of June, under Captain Isaac Schomberg. She was captained by Sir Thomas Troubridge in the Battle of Cape St Vincent, in which he led the line. Culloden was damaged, and had 10 men killed and 47 wounded. She later took part in the Battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife. She participated in the Battle of the Nile, but ran aground on shoals before being able to engage the French fleet, and subsequently did not actively engage the enemy. She was assisted by HMS Mutine whilst aground. Napoleonic Wars Culloden, Captain Christopher Cole, captured the French privateer √âmilien on 26 September 1806 after a chase that lasted two days and a night. He described her as a ship corvette of 18 guns and 150 men. When the British took possession of Emilien at 2a.m. on the 25th, close off the shoals of Point Guadaveri they found out that they had driven her ashore the night before. She had had to jettison 12 guns, her anchors, and her boats, to enable her to be refloated. Cole noted that √âmilien was \\"formerly His Majesty's Sloop Trincomalee\\". He further noted that she was copper fastened, and that under the name of Gloire had \\"annoyed our Trade\\". However, on this cruise she was two months out of √éle de France without having made any captures. Lloyd's List reported that Culloden had captured a large French privateer named Ameleon in the Indian Sea and taken her into Madras.Lloyd's List 25 March 1807, ‚Ññ4137. The Royal Navy took √âmilien into service as HMS Emilien, but sold her in 1808 and it is not clear that she ever saw active service. On 5 July 1808 Culloden captured the French privateer Union off Ceylon. Union had been at sea for 27 days, having sailed from Mauritius, when she encountered Culloden, but had not captured anything. Union was armed with eight guns and had a crew of 60 Europeans and 20 lascars.Asiatic Annual Register (1811), Vol. 10, p.68. Fate Culloden was finally broken up in February 1813.

It was first published in Rhythm in Spring 1912 and was republished in Something Childish and Other Stories (1924). Plot summary Jo, Hin, and the narrator are riding horses, then they stop at a store where Hin went four years ago, joking that a blue-eyed blonde lives there. There they are greeted by a woman who appears to be mentally unstable and disheveled with missing teeth. They get an embrocation from the store to treat a wound on the horse, they ask her if they can stay in the nearby field at first she declines then she agrees she later suggests giving them dinner and at the part she eventually lets them stay for the night in the store. Jo and Hin joke about the woman referring to how she knows 'how to kiss one hundred and twenty-five different ways'. The Narrator bathes in the river. They discover that the woman has attempted to make herself look pretty by putting on a rouge and a different dress. Jo has combed back his hair, shaved, and changed. They start to get drunk and Jo and The Woman start 'kissing feet' under the table, slowly growing closer as they get more intoxicated. The Woman's daughter claims to be drawing a nude picture of the Narrator, saying she watched her bathing earlier. The Narrator is unsettled but the picture is not revealed. As she gets more drunk The Woman claims that her husband often beats her, forces sex on her, goes away often shearing for months at a time and that she is alone and isolated living in poverty. She then leaves and comes back and then goes off again. Her daughter threatens to draw the picture she's not allowed to and gets a smack and a stern warning from her mother. Hin and the Narrator stay in the storeroom with The Woman's daughter. She then does a drawing of a woman pointing a gun at a man and a picture of a grave, hinting that her mother killed her father, thus exposing at least part of The Woman's story as untrue.

He is the namesake of the Bibi Torriani Cup, an annual competition for players aged 14 representing various Cantons of Switzerland. The event is used to identify future players for the national team program. The International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) established the Torriani Award in 2015, named after Torriani. When the new award was announced, the IIHF president Ren√© Fasel said; \\"We wanted to create a trophy which honours players for a great international career irrespective of where they played. Nowadays, with NHL players and international players often being the same, we feel that there are so many top players to honour. Still, we wanted to ensure we recognized players who didn't necessarily win Olympic and World Championship medals but who still had remarkable careers. As a result, we created the Torriani Award, and Lucio Topatigh is a very worthy first recipient\\". For the 100th anniversary of the Ice Hockey World Championships in 2020, Torriani was named to the IIHF All-time Switzerland team.

There are also regional state archives located in Bjelovar, Dubrovnik, Gospiƒá, Karlovac, Osijek, Pazin, Rijeka, Sisak, Slavonski Brod, Split, Vara≈ædin and Zadar. History The Croatian State Archives trace their origin to a 1643 decision of the Croatian Sabor in which the Kingdom's treasurer (blagajnik) Ivan Zakmardi is instructed to create an inventory of all the laws, charters and other documents. This was followed by the commission to construct a special chest at the Kingdom's expense which would house the most important documents in the aforementioned inventory.Stjepan Antoljak, Pregled hrvatske povijesti, Split, 1994., str. 101. The chest only had symbolic meaning, since it could only house a negligible amount of documentation and was located on the grounds of the Bishopric of Zagreb. The number of laws and regulation were subsequently passed in relation to archiving documents. The Croatian Parliament named Ladislaus Kiraly as the first archivist of the kingdom in 1744, transferring the chest and the rest of the documentation to the Saint Mark's square in 1763.

Biography Freeman was born in Chicago, Illinois. At age 3, she moved with her parents and two brothers to Brooklyn, later moving to New Rochelle, New York and attending New Rochelle High School. Her father was a chemical engineer who had graduated from the Illinois Institute of Technology, and her mother was a mathematics teacher and graduate of the University of Wisconsin. Freeman was a graduate of Wellesley College (1942), where she majored in English literature with a minor in music. She had originally trained to be a concert pianist, practicing six to eight hours per day for twenty years, but eventually, by the mid-1960s, gave up this dream to pursue concert managing. Following her graduation, she married Stanley Freeman, and the couple had four children. Their marriage ended in divorce. Freeman's second marriage was to the Italian sculptor and painter Franco Assetto (1911-1991), with whom she lived half of each year in Turin. The marriage lasted until Assetto's death. Freeman was a long-standing supporter of contemporary music, with grants and commissions to various American composers early in their careers. The composers she assisted include Lou Harrison, John Cage, La Monte Young, Christopher Rouse, Philip Glass, Steve Reich, John Adams, Anders Hillborg, Pierre Boulez, Harrison Birtwistle, Virgil Thomson, Helmut Lachenmann, and Kaija Saariaho. John Cage dedicated his Freeman Etudes to her (although she did not commission them), Lou Harrison dedicated his Serenade for Betty Freeman and Franco Assetto to Freeman and her husband, Steve Reich dedicated Variations for Winds, Strings, and Keyboards (1979) and Vermont Counterpoint (1982) to her, and John Adams's opera Nixon in China (1985‚Äì87) was dedicated to her. The American gamelan Si Betty, built by Harrison and William Colvig in 1979, was named for Freeman. Bequeathed by Harrison to long-time collaborator and composer Jody Diamond, it has been housed at Harvard University since 2007. She began a series of musicales at her Beverly Hills residence in 1981, which continued until just after the death of her second husband. Freeman financed a 1973 documentary film about the composer and instrument builder Harry Partch, The Dreamer That Remains. She subsequently developed an interest in photography. She wrote books about the American artists Clyfford Still and Sam Francis. She was also an art collector, and the subject of David Hockney's painting Beverly Hills Housewife. Freeman had four children from her first marriage, her daughters Shelley Butler and Claudia Brotman, and her sons Robert Freeman and Corey Freeman.

Attracting visitors from all over the globe to Southern California. The event is now held on-site at California Speedway in Fontana California after many years at Mazda's corporate headquarters in Irvine, California. Highlights of the event include the display of many historic Mazda race cars and road going models, various notable guest speakers, free car show, raffle. The event is coordinated by members of the Southern California RX Club.  History  SevenStock began in 1998 as a local BBQ held by the Southern California RX-7 Club also known as the SoCal7's at that time and was an effort to bring together local RX-7 and rotary vehicle owners. As a play on the music and art festival of similar name held in New York, SevenStock was born. With less than twenty attendees at the first event, SevenStock has grown to hundreds of rotary vehicles and thousands of attendees. Both SevenStock 2 and 3 were also held at Frank G. Bonelli in San Dimas, CA, and continued to grow at a tremendous pace. SevenStock 2 had over 40 vehicles and SevenStock 3 boasted over 80 vehicles and more than 135 attendees. SevenStock 4 began a new chapter in the life of the event. After growing attendance and notoriety within the rotary community, SevenStock began to gain the attention of top tuners and even Mazda itself. SevenStock was moved to Mazda's Research and Development Center in Irvine, CA where the event saw exponential growth. The event now had grown to over 300 vehicles and attendees estimated around 2000. SevenStock 4 also featured the infamous LeMans winning 787B. Mazda North America President Charlie Hughes was on-hand to introduce the 4-rotor race car to the crowd. Once the 787B was fired up SevenStock would never be the same. SevenStock became the destination to see up close and personal some of the most famous and historic Mazda rotary vehicles in the world. The 787B was driven by former Mazda program manager Takaharu \\"Koby\\" Kobayakawa who would become a regular at future SevenStock events. Other notable rotary powered vehicles on display include Flaco Racing's R100 and RX-7 drag cars, Racing Beat's record holding Bonneville racer, two 3-rotor sand rails as well as the \\"La Policia\\" drag car. SevenStock 4 through 8 were also held on-site at the Mazda Research and Development facility. Each year the event continued to grow as did the guest list of vehicles. SevenStock 5 hosted an estimated 4000 attendees and vehicles had to be turned away as over 400+ enthusiasts filled the Mazda parking lots and surrounding streets. In addition to the return of Mazda North America President Charlie Hughes and program manager Koby Kobayakawa, Kazuo Takada was also on hand to reminisce for the crowd. Takada, a former Mazda engineer and one of the fabled \\"47 Rotary Engineers\\" recalled the development of the rotary engine and explained how they overcame many of the obstacles faced during the development of the rotary engine. SevenStock 9 signaled a change for the event, as it was moved to Mazda's corporate headquarters in Irvine, CA, just a few miles from the R&D; site. The new location was considerably larger and was able to accommodate the continued growth of the event. Today SevenStock has grown to become one of the largest all-rotary car shows and events of its kind and continues to be the Mecca of all things rotary. SevenStock has the support of Mazda, individuals and tuners worldwide. The now evolved Southern California RX Club includes all rotary powered vehicles from motorcycles to exotics and continues to organize and staff SevenStock along with help from the entire rotary community. SevenStock 22 is currently scheduled to take place at the California Speedway in Fontana, California, on November 9, 2019.

It can be played with any number of players. The basic idea is that everyone stands in a circle. Two baseballs are tossed between the players. Each player gets three outs. An out is awarded for a bad throw or a missed catch. A player who records three outs must step out of the circle. The winner of the game is the last player remaining in the circle. Two-ball was created in Indianapolis, Indiana by the Bishop Chatard High School baseball team sometime in the late 1980s.  The Basics  The game can be played with any number of players, but four to ten is probably best. The players should stand in a circle, with each player approximately three feet from the players on their left and right. Play begins when one player serves the balls. To serve the ball, the player holds one ball in each hand, and tosses them underhanded to two different people in the circle. Each of these two people toss the balls to other players in the circle without disrupting the rhythm. The tossing continues until a ball is not caught, and play stops. An out is assessed to either the thrower (if it was an errant throw) or the catcher (if a catch that should have been made was not). Once an out has been assessed, play begins again, with the person who recorded the last out serving. Only one out may be recorded per frame. Play continues in this manner until one person has been charged with three outs. That player has lost, and must stand outside the circle. Play continues with the remaining players. At the point in the game in which only four people remain, the serve is different. Instead of one person tossing both balls to different players, two players who are across from each other start with one ball each and toss them simultaneously. When three players are left, serving returns to the original method, used for five or more players. When two people remain, play becomes very different. The player with fewer outs throws first. If the two players have equal outs, the winner of a best-out-of-three rock-paper-scissors (no shoot) contest throws first. The players stand three to five feet apart. A player throws both balls one-hand, and the other player must catch both. If the throw is makes it impossible to catch both‚Äîat arm level, they are farther apart than the span of the catcher's arms‚Äîit counts as a catch, and catcher becomes the thrower. A player is out if they miss a catch but the other player makes the catch. The first player to get three outs, including outs from earlier in the game, loses.  Key rules not mentioned in 'The Basics'  The Serve: No out may be charged on the serve. Mid-Air Collisions and Negative Outs: If the balls collide in mid-air, play stops. Each player who catches a ball after a collision is awarded with a negative out. That is, for each ball caught by a certain player after a collision, that player is allowed an additional out before their side retires. If one player catches both balls after a collision, they receive two negative outs. Balls colliding on a serve produce no negative outs, since there can be no positive outs either. Server Immunity: If after the server throws the balls to two different players, both players choose to throw their balls back to the server, and the server does not make the catch, they aren't charged with an out, and get the chance to serve again. If the server does make the catch, play continues as usual. Putting the Balls Together: If both balls are caught at the same time, they may be \\"put together,\\" at which point normal play stops. The balls may then be thrown according to the manner in which they are thrown when just two people are left. If the player trying to catch the balls fails, they receive an out. Note that the balls do not have to be put together, and that normal play could stop, as the balls are put together, and then begin anew if a player makes the catch and opts to separate them again.  Other Rules  These rules are not as widely accepted worldwide as most rules above, but they are popular in the mid-western United States. The Ten-foot Rule: During normal play, balls may not be thrown more than ten feet in the air. If they are, but are caught, play continues. If they are, but are not caught, it becomes a do-over and the thrower is chastised by the other players. When the balls are \\"put together\\" or when there are just two players left, a twenty-foot rule replaces the ten- foot rule. The Three Strikes and You're Out Rule: Since there are no outs on the serve, there can be several serves before regular play begins. This rule stipulates that a who player makes an out-worthy mistake on the serve is charged with a strike but not an out. If a player gets three strikes before successfully serving, they receive an out. Strikes do not carry over to different frames. Another Version Another version of \\"Two-Ball\\" can be played much like the basketball game \\"21.\\" This version of \\"Two-Ball\\" is played with 3 players and 2 basketballs. Games are played to 16 points (1 point for field goals, 2 points for beyond the 3-point arc). Play is stopped when any player reaches 5, 10, and 15 point plateaus. Player who causes the stoppage (because he/she reached a point plateau) retains possession of the ball. Possession of the other ball goes to the player with the fewest points. Consider the following scenario: Player A has 4 points, Player B has 2 points, and Player C has 3 points. Player A makes a layup, stopping play because Player A now has 5 points. Player A retains possession when play resumes and Player B is awarded possession regardless of whether he/she had possession when Player A reached 5 points because Player B had the fewest points. If two players both have the same number of points when the third player reaches his/her point plateau, then the player who had possession at the moment of the stoppage retains possession. The two players with the ball are called \\"right baller\\" and \\"left baller.\\" Traditionally, the player without the ball is referred to as the \\"shaft man.\\" Standard basketball rules apply in terms of fouls and take-outs. This game was invented by 3 men playing with 2 basketballs on Tuesday, July 2, 2013 in a stuffy gymnasium in St. Louis, Missouri.

The most important of these, Tristrams saga ok √çs√∂ndar, based on Thomas of Britain's Tristan, is notable as the only example of Thomas' \\"courtly branch\\" of the Tristan and Iseult legend that has survived in its entirety. It was the earliest Scandinavian version of the story, and is thought to be the first Norwegian adaptation of an Old French work. Its success may have inspired the spate of translations during King Haakon's reign.Schach, The Saga of Tristram and √çs√∂nd, p. xiii. Robert's nationality is unknown, but his name and other circumstantial evidence suggests he was Anglo- Norman. As such he may have been connected to the Cistercian monasteries of Lyse Abbey or Hoved√∏ya Abbey, which maintained close ties with England. Robert's name is connected to one other work with assurance, Elis saga, an adaptation of the chanson de geste Elie de St. Gille, where he is called \\"Abbot.\\" Four other anonymous works largely on Arthurian subjects have been attributed to him; these are √çvens saga and Parcevals saga, based on Chr√©tien de Troyes' romances Yvain, the Knight of the Lion and Perceval, the Story of the Grail; M√∂ttuls saga, a version of the poem Le Mantel Mautailli√©; and a collection of lais based on the Lais of Marie de France called Strengleikar. Robert's translations at Haakon's commission speak to the king's role in spreading French and Arthurian material throughout Scandinavia. The wide influence of Tristrams saga ok √çs√∂ndar is especially apparent in Iceland, where it served as the basis for the ballad \\"Tristrams kv√¶√∞i\\" and the prose adaptation Saga af Tristram ok ƒ∫sodd.

Chlodorich then told Clovis of the murder and offered him the finest treasures of his newly inherited kingdom as a symbol of their new alliance. Clovis sent messengers to assess the treasure, who then asked Chlodoric to plunge his hand as deeply into his gold coins as possible. With his arm submerged, the envoys of Clovis then killed the new king in betrayal. Clovis then stood before the people of Chlodoric and told them that the son had sent assassins to murder his father, but that Chlodoric had subsequently met his own end as well. Clovis then offered his protection to the former subjects of Sigobert and Chlodoric, and thus became their king. Gregory suggests that Chlodoric was murdered in the same campaign that killed the Frankish King Chararic. Before, Clovis had killed Ragnachar and his brothers. After all these murders, Gregory tells us that Clovis lamented that he had no family left, implying that among his own casualties were close relatives. References *Gregory of Tours.

The village, along with the hamlet of Hangen- Wahlheim, lies amidst vineyards at the foot of the Rhenish-Hessian Rhine terraces between Mainz and Worms. Favoured as it is by its central location between the Frankfurt Rhine Main Region and the Rhine-Neckar conurbations, Alsheim has for a long time been growing into a markedly residential community. New housing developments will further strengthen this trend. Nevertheless, winegrowing still defines the village's character. With more than 700 ha of vineyard, Alsheim is one of Rhenish Hesse's most important winegrowing centres in Germany's biggest wine region. The wines, overwhelmingly from traditional white and red varieties of grape, are widely known for their quality. Hiking trails and a wine heritage trail, together with cycle paths, connect the countryside. There are several inns and winemaking estates.

It is also one of the biggest in the whole of Rhineland-Palatinate. A peculiarity in Alsheim's landscape is to be found in its broad network of sunken lanes. They stretch on for 11.5 km within the municipal area and were carved into the surrounding land by centuries of human activity wearing the land down.

Armsheim lies in the Rhenish-Hessian Hills, has roughly 2,650 inhabitants and is the third biggest municipality within the Verbandsgemeinde of W√∂rrstadt, whose seat is in the like-named municipality. The current Armsheim was formed out of two formerly autonomous centres in 1969, named Armsheim and Schimsheim.  Geography  = Location = Armsheim lies in the middle of Rhenish Hesse, some 14 km from Alzey, 18 km from Bad Kreuznach, 25 km from Bingen and some 30 km southwest of Mainz.  History  = Before the Christian Era = For 40,000 years there have been people living on the floodplain in the Wiesbach valley, and for 1,500 years, the villages of Armsheim and Schimsheim have stood here. The open land here, scored by brooks, offered Old Stone Age hunter-gatherers ideal living conditions. From the New Stone Age (after 4000 BC), the land was permanently settled. Crop farming and livestock raising underpinned the settlers‚Äô livelihood. Many Neolithic, Bronze Age and Iron Age (specifically from La T√®ne times) finds show heavy settlement. One of these people's centres was formed by lands that now make up the new development area. Surface-level witnesses to this early time are the menhirs, of which, however, only one still stands near its original location. In the 5th century BC, a Celtic princely seat was to be found in what is now the municipal area. A grave that had been part of the complex was opened while a railway was being built. Precious artifacts yielded up by the grave included parts of a carriage and Etruscan bronze dishes, revealing something about these Princes‚Äô power and wealth. Their hegemony presumably included the Celtic town on the Wi√überg (a nearby hill). Celtic times ended at about the time of the dawn of the Christian Era, when Roman rule began. = Roman Empire = In the four hundred years during which the Romans held sway, the land was worked by state-owned farms. Where these estates lay can be determined by archaeological finds and toponyms, especially ones containing Weiler (in Modern High German, this means ‚Äúhamlet‚Äù, but it is derived from the Latin villa, as in villa rustica, which was the Latin term for one of these estates). A sanctuary in Jupiter‚Äôs honour stood somewhere near where the Armsheim church now stands, and in the municipal area‚Äôs west also a sanctuary in Diana‚Äôs honour. In the Suntflur, a rural area, the area of an old villa, marked by boundary stones, was preserved into the 20th century. The Roman estates were forsaken towards the end of the 4th century after Germanic tribes began pushing across the Rhine and the Roman military withdrew. = Frankish times = Both Armsheim‚Äôs and Schimsheim‚Äôs actual histories began when the Franks took over the land about 500. The villages were made up of loose groupings of farms around a central estate with a church and a graveyard, after whose owners the two centres were named. Further farms could be found without. In the turbulent 12th and 13th centuries, they were forsaken, resulting in the still observable townlike concentration of the settlements, which were shielded by hedgerows and ditches. The courses followed by roads and the building development give important clues as to both villages‚Äô emergence and development. Schimsheim's centre is formed nowadays by the little square, itself formed by the roads that meet there. There also once stood the village and court tree, the legendary Schimsheim Elm. The limetree now growing here was planted in the hollow left by the elm after it died. Originally, this was the village's outskirts; the old well is still preserved a few steps away to the south. The adjoining Kirchgasse (church lane) shows where Saint Martin's church was before it was destroyed in the Thirty Years' War. Armsheim's settlement structure shows the economic foundations on which the village was built, and also what the driving forces of its development were. Unlike Schimsheim's quiet development, here it was marked by a quick upswing leading to a brief blossoming, followed by a downfall that was just as quick. Two centres of settlement may be distinguished, one lying north of the through road with the Freier Platz (‚ÄúFree Square‚Äù), and one to the south along M√ºhlstra√üe (‚ÄúMill Road‚Äù). There is much to suggest that this was a planned settlement, especially the nearly square layout of the Rosenplatz (‚ÄúRose Square‚Äù), which is reminiscent of a town marketplace. Standing as driving forces were Saint Remigius's Church (St. Remigius-Kirche) and the castle of the local lords, the Counts of Veldenz. The church's blood reliquary became the goal of a pilgrimage that drew worshippers from well beyond the region, and also the cause of building the pilgrimage Church ‚ÄúTo the Holy Blood‚Äù (1431), which is counted among the most important Gothic buildings on the Rhine Gorge. The Counts‚Äô seat was the hub of their holdings in this area. The village was granted town rights no later than 1349 and was fortified with walls and towers. Armsheim was said to be the best fortified town in the Nahegau. Parts of the old wall are preserved between the churchyard and Neugasse (lane), as are the Bielgraben (dyke) and underground passages. Three gatekeeper's houses establish the settlement's expansion over a long time. The Gothic church's size and beauty reveal yet more about Armsheim's importance as a pilgrimage destination and a Veldenz town. When the family Veldenz died out and the Protestant Reformation was introduced, this development ended: The town passed to Electoral Palatinate in 1471, the walls and towers were torn down, the town was stripped of its town rights, and it was assigned to the Oberamt of Alzey. The Reformation brought the destruction of the church's interior and an end to the pilgrimage. Traces of the destruction can be seen in Father Odenkemmer's gravestone in the church's chancel and in the shattered figure of a saint, which was walled up in an estate on the main street. The small square, where once stood the communal bakehouse, may be regarded as Armsheim's village centre. Not far from there was the pranger, later the communal scale. Not far above stands the old town hall, from whose fa√ßade comes the measurement standard, the iron ellwand, which is now fastened onto the Evangelical church's vestibule. Also, the village's biggest inn was not far. Outside the village, on the road to Schimsheim, stood the hospital for lepers, the Gutleuthaus, and on the road to Alzey stood the hangman's house. The toponym Galgenberg (‚ÄúGallows Mountain‚Äù) south of the railway station refers to the old execution place. Not only had Armsheim lost its importance as an administrative seat and a pilgrimage centre, but nor was any business or trade forthcoming either. What was lacking was a link to the long-distance road network. The road from Worms to Bingen, the Hohe Stra√üe (‚ÄúHigh Road‚Äù), led through Flonheim, west of the village, missing it altogether, while the Alte Stra√üe (‚ÄúOld Road‚Äù) from Alzey to Ingelheim ran by to the east, somewhat following the railway's current alignment. Moreover, the local history in the 17th and 18th centuries was marked by repeated destruction and sacking. Little was left after the Nine Years' War and its attendant ravages in the Palatinate by King Louis XIV's troops. One of the first systematic expansions of the village came in the 18th century on the filled-in ditch (Neugasse ‚Äì ‚ÄúNew Lane‚Äù), but it was not until the early 19th century that this road reached the highway. = From the 19th century onwards = A new epoch in the village's development dawned with the expansion of the Rhenish-Hessian road network in the 1830s and the building of the Bingen-Worms railway line (Rheinhessenbahn) in 1870, the Mainz-Alzey line (1871) and the Armsheim-Wendelsheim line (1871‚Äì1895). The settlement that sprang up after 1870 at the railway station was based on wine, coal and livestock trade as well as cooperage. The building development that arose along Bahnhofstra√üe (‚ÄúRailway Station Street‚Äù, formerly known as Sauweg ‚Äì ‚ÄúSow Way‚Äù) reflects the railway's importance to the village over a hundred years. Another village expansion came in the form of a new-town development, begun in 1983, which united the two villages, which had been politically one since 1969. The phases in the local history from the 16th century onwards can easily be gathered from the development of house and homestead forms. The typical Frankish homesteads bespeak an agricultural livelihood, in part combined with crafts. After 1870 the houses show with their outbuildings how the new townsmen, who came mainly from the countryside, sought a livelihood in hired labour and agricultural sidelines (especially in the railway station area). Houses from the third phase show no regional style and are designed for a life in town, bearing no hint of country life, local history or agriculture, bringing local history into a critical phase.

The upper charge is the Palatine Lion. The lower charge is canting, suggesting the municipality's name (‚ÄúArm‚Äù means the same in German as in English). The oldest town seals date from the early 15th century and already show these two charges. At one time, the hand held a bunch of grapes, symbolizing winegrowing, but this was dropped in the 19th century.Description and explanation of Armsheim‚Äôs arms  Economy and infrastructure  = Transport = With its railway station, Armsheim forms an important hub in Rhenish Hesse. Crossing here are the two railway lines: the Alzey‚ÄìMainz railway and the Rheinhessen Railway (Rheinhessenbahn) from Bingen am Rhein to Worms. Formerly there was also a line sprouting off to the Wiesbachtalbahn towards Wendelsheim by way of Flonheim, which saw an end to its passenger traffic by 1966. On weekends and holidays, it is possible to travel on the Elsass-Express (‚ÄúAlsace Express‚Äù) to Wissembourg.  Culture and sightseeing = Buildings = *Kirche ‚ÄúZum Heiligen Blut‚Äù (Church ‚ÄúTo the Holy Blood‚Äù). The Evangelical church is one of Rhenish Hesse's loveliest Gothic village churches. The church is still called Zum Heiligen Blut Christi (‚ÄúTo Christ‚Äôs Holy Blood‚Äù) even today. It was built in 1431 for ‚Äúthe worship of Christ‚Äôs wonder-working blood‚Äù. Even today it is called ‚ÄúRhenish Hesse‚Äôs loveliest village church‚Äù. A particular jewel is the memorial organ, which is particularly worthy of protection, built by the famous organ builder Johann Michael Stumm in 1739. Each year, outstanding organists perform in the concert series Armsheimer Orgelsommer (‚Äúorgan summer‚Äù). During intermission, concertgoers are treated to the Orgeltropfen (‚Äúorgan drop‚Äù), a yearly special bottling of Armsheim wine, in the summertime church garden. A particularly strong draw for art lovers from the whole region is the project Kunst und Kirche (‚ÄúArt and Church‚Äù). Each year, there is at least one presentation of contemporary religious artistic creation in the old pilgrimage church. In 2001, a collective artwork was created: Dietrich Bonhoeffer - Versuch einer Ann√§herung (‚ÄúDietrich Bonhoeffer ‚Äì Attempt at Harmonization‚Äù), using pictures, words and music. Under Mainz Professor Guido Ludes's leadership, various creative artists found themselves working together on this co√∂perative project.

A new mode, Tower of Lost Souls, requires the player to win battles in order to gain rewards.Namco Bandai Games America The game runs in HD resolution with 5.1 channel surround sound on both platforms. The Character Creation mode from Soulcalibur III returns in Soulcalibur IV. However, instead of including original weapon styles for use with certain classes of fighters, Soulcalibur IV only allows players to choose which character from the series they would like to have their created character mimic. This differs from Soulcalibur III, where there were many unique styles such as \\"Grieve Edge\\". The styles of Algol, the bonus characters and the Star Wars guest characters cannot be used by player-created characters. A wide array of new pieces of equipment are available for use in Soulcalibur IVs Character Creation mode, and new options include a wider range of character voices and the ability to change their pitch. The player may also change a character's general physique and muscularity. In addition, equipped items now also affect a character's statistics. Armor, weapons, and accessories may increase health, attack, or defense; they may also grant skill points that allow the character to equip special traits that affect the character's playstyle. These traits may include automatically triggered guard impacts, the ability to cause damage against a blocking opponent, or even a statistic increase based on parameters such as an opponent's alignment or gender. Standard characters may also be modified in this manner, albeit only modestly, allowing custom costumes and skill sets to be used in Special VS. mode. Custom characters may still be used in Standard VS. mode, but without any of the special abilities gained through equipment or weapon choice. One profile is allowed for Offline VS. mode, meaning that only one profile's created characters can be loaded at any one time. Multi-fighter battles in Soulcalibur IV use a different structure from its predecessors, nicknamed Active Matching Battle (AMB). Similar to the tag system of games such as The King of Fighters 2003, the AMB system allows players to switch to other members of a party of fighters mid battle. Instead of starting a new round for each opponent defeated, new opponents simply run into the battle immediately after a K.O., with the exception of certain combatants. Matches utilizing the AMB system only appear in the Story and Tower of Lost Souls modes. Soulcalibur IV features an all-new Critical Finish system. Next to a player's health meter is a colored gem: the Soul Gauge. The gem changes color when the player blocks an attack or has his or her own attack blocked by a Guard Impact. The color gradually changes from blue to green, then to red and eventually flashing red. The player's own Soul Gauge regenerates if he or she makes an attack and hits the opponent, guarding or otherwise. If the character manages to empty out the opponent's Soul Gauge, the enemy is destroying a piece of armor (characters now show permanent signs of visual damage such as broken and torn clothing) and producing a short stun during which the character can perform a powerful Critical Finish move, which is able to defeat the opponent instantly, by pressing all four face buttons at the same time. Each character has his or her own personal Critical Finish move. Namco developed the Soul Gauge to decrease the benefits from constant guarding, thus giving the game a faster tempo and making the matches more offensive. The Star Wars guest characters, Darth Vader, Yoda and the Apprentice, utilize unique attacks using the Force. Darth Vader is able to utilize Force-based blasts, punches, and chokes; Yoda can use the Force to launch himself into the air for complex aerial attacks; finally, the Apprentice is able to use Force lightning and other dark-side moves. These moves drain a special Force Meter, which recharges gradually when not in use. If the Force Meter is depleted, the player momentarily loses control of the character. For the first time in the series, Soulcalibur IV includes an online multiplayer option. Versus modes available in online battles are Standard VS (for classic matches) and Special VS (for customized characters). Created characters are playable in the online multiplayer mode. A player's wins and losses are recorded and used to establish a ranking level, which reflects online skill. Characters Soulcalibur IV contains a roster of 34 fighters. Many characters from the Soul series returning, with 2 newcomers and 3 guest characters from The Star Wars franchise (Darth Vader, Yoda and The Apprentice). Initially, Darth Vader appeared on the PlayStation 3, and Yoda appeared on the Xbox 360 full game download; Namco later made both characters downloadable content on the opposite platform for a fee. The Apprentice, the main protagonist of Star Wars: The Force Unleashed, is playable on both the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions. Revenant, Frederick Schtauffen and several other minor Soul series characters make an appearance in battle, and most can be made in Character Creation mode. Several bonus characters designed by manga artists (Angol Fear, Ashlotte, Kamikirimusi, Scheherazade, and Shura) are also playable in the game, and use the fighting styles of returning characters. They are designed by Mine Yoshizaki, Ito ≈ågure, Hirokazu Hisayuki, Yutaka Izubuchi and Hiroya Oku respectively. *Algol *Amy *Angol Fear *Ashlotte *Astaroth *Cassandra *Cervantes *Darth Vader *Hilde *Ivy *Kamikirimusi *Kilik *Lizardman *Maxi *Mitsurugi *Nightmare *Raphael *Rock *Scheherazade *Seong Mi- na *Setsuka *Shura *Siegfried *Sophitia *Taki *Talim *The Apprentice *Tira *Voldo *Xianghua *Yoda *Yoshimitsu *Yun-seong *Zasalamel =Notes= Guest character Unlockable Bonus unlockable characters Newcomers Plot The story of Soulcalibur IV, told via in-game written profiles and movies, centers around the appearance of the ancient king Algol, his tower, and his connection to the origin of the spirit sword named Soulcalibur. Every character's motivation and relationship to the other characters is diagrammed in a mode called Chain of Souls. As usual, none of the individual endings from the previous game are considered canonical events, and most of the characters' motivations from that game remain unresolved. However, a small number of characters did experience important events associated with universal Soulcalibur III events. Siegfried has died and been resurrected by the Soulcalibur sword. Sophitia's daughter Pyrrha has been kidnapped by Tira and malfested by Soul Edge, leaving Sophitia to fight for the side of evil in defense of her now-corrupted daughter. Tira is now suffering from a split-personality disorder. Most characters are still motivated by a desire to either obtain, destroy, or defend one or both of the legendary swords now carried by Siegfried and Nightmare, and most characters face Algol as the final boss of Story mode. All characters feature animated ending movies. Release The Premium Edition of Soulcalibur IV included a 48-page softcover art/comic book illustrated in full color, an XL 100% cotton T-shirt, and a tournament chart that allowed \\"fans the opportunity to document the battle amongst friends.\\" The reverse side of the chart was a poster. It was packaged in a metal case and was released on the same date as the regular edition, along with exclusive access to extra customization content in this version. This extra content was the automatic unlocking of the most powerful weapons and joke weapons for each character, as well as clothing items to create a schoolboy or schoolgirl character. In New Zealand, Australia, and Europe there was a steelbook case edition instead, including a bonus DVD containing four trailers in HD, four wallpapers, exclusive concept art, and an exclusive booklet with character biographies. Shortly after the initial release, various pieces of paid downloadable content were made available including music tracks from the original Soulcalibur, customization equipment, and weapon packs. On October 23, 2008 the options to play as Yoda in the PS3 version of the game and Darth Vader in the Xbox 360 version were made available via paid downloadable content. However, both DLC were later removed from PSN and XBL due to licensing from the purchase of Star Wars by Disney. Reception Soulcalibur IV received mostly positive reviews from media outlets. In 2014, six years after its initial release, it held an average Metacritic score of 85 for both its PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions. The game was praised for its polished graphics, deep Character Creation mode, and its long-awaited online play capability. Reviewers also noted that the gameplay was accessible for newcomers and beginners but still had plenty of depth and technicality for veterans and experienced players, including an abundance of single player challenges in Tower of Lost Souls mode. The music was also praised, and Gaming Revolution summarised the game as \\"some of the best weapons-based fighting action in town\\". Certain criticisms were directed towards the guest characters from the Star Wars franchise, with several critics maintaining that their presence was unnatural and that Yoda and the Apprentice in particular were \\"broken\\" (a reference to a perceived imbalance in fighting games that gives some characters a vastly unfair advantage over other characters in gameplay) and \\"absurd,\\" respectively. Yoda's smaller size (and thus his immunity to grab attacks) is mentioned as one such design problem. At the same time, Yoda's short range and low damage output were deemed problematic, making him both overpowered and underpowered at the same time. Soulcalibur IV topped the UK sales charts for several weeks on both the PS3 and Xbox 360. As of March 31, 2009, the game had sold 2.3 million copies worldwide. =Awards and accolades= *IGN Best of 2008: Best Xbox 360 Fighting Game *Spike TV Video Game Awards: Best Fighting Game *IGN's Top 20 Most Popular Xbox 360 Games of 2008: 17th *Virgin Media's Top 20 beat 'em-ups of all time (2009): sixth In 2010, the game was included as one of the titles in the book 1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die. Sequel Project Soul (the development team of the Soul series) had always given the impression that Soulcalibur IV would be their last installment as the team was rumored to have disbanded. However, Katsuhiro Harada (producer of the Tekken series) said he would seriously consider a sequel if there was sufficient interest and informed fans that he was willing to accept opinions and requests through Twitter, asking for the messages to be short and simple due to his poor English skills. While the possibility of a sequel was stronger than ever, Namco had not made any statement to solidify their commitment for the game. Fans were encouraged to maintain support and show interest to secure development of Soulcalibur V. On May 11, 2011, Namco Bandai officially announced the new game, which was released for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 on January 31, 2012.

Ceedo uses software virtualization technologies to create application containers, claiming to eliminate or reduce endpoint security threats like viruses or ransomware.  History  Ceedo Technologies was originally founded as a software virtualization platform by Dror Wettenstein in 2005. Since then, Ceedo has been using virtualization technology to make productivity tools for individual and enterprise use. In recent years, the company has followed the rising global trend of employment of virtualization in cybersecurity and shifted its focus to that industry. = Ceedo Personal = Ceedo Personal was a portable operating system that allowed users to carry applications on portable media (such as USB flash drives and pocket hard drives), running them inside a virtual environment, while using resources from the host PC (screen, processing power, drives, internet connection, printers). Applications were launched in an independent environment, allowing them to run regardless of the specific settings of the host computer. Ceedo Personal has been licensed by consumer storage vendors including Lexar,\\"A Flash Drive That Holds Your Computer\\", David Pogue, New York Times: https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/15/technology/15pogue.html?pagewanted=all Seagate,Seagate FreeAgent Go 160 GB - Review Tom's Hardware: http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/external-hdd-spring-fever,1582-5.html Verbatim, Maxell, ExcelStor, Venzero and others. The product has been pre- bundled on millions of devices and sold worldwide. Ceedo Personal has often been compared to another product, U3, similar in both appearance and functionality. = Ceedo Enterprise = Introduced in 2008,Ceedo Enterprise announcement: Ceedo Enterprise was a version of Ceedo platform designed for business use and included remote management capabilities. Ceedo Enterprise was designed to be carried primarily on encrypted hardware and could have been customized and pre-configured. Ceedo and Citrix partnered in 2008 to create a portable version of the Citrix XenApp client.Ceedo and Citrix announcement: = Cybersecurity = After several years of hiatus, Ceedo resumed operations in 2016. The company continued developing virtualization technologies, with focus switched to cybersecurity. Ceedo has several patents pending for its virtualization technology.  Technology  Ceedo claims to protect computers from being compromised (from both known and unknown malware threats, including zero-day attacks) by using application containers. Such application containers create isolation barrier between potentially vulnerable application (like web browsers) and the host system. = Application containers = Ceedo utilizes application containerization technology and context-based access controls to isolate web-facing applications and attempt to completely separate all untrusted content from the host. Potential malware execution is privilege- restricted that way and confined only to the isolated container created by Ceedo. Ceedo's context-based approach determines context by looking at the security classification of the application/process requesting to operate on a file, the file on which it is requesting to operate, and the nature of the operation (i.e. read/write). From this context, Ceedo derives the permissions it will allow the requesting application/process, the boundaries of the security container that encapsulates its execution and the isolation policies applied to its boundaries with the host system. Ceedo containers exist solely on the host and use only local resources. = Similar solutions = Companies like Symantec and Bromium use similar containerization technologies for their products.  MalwareLocker  MalwareLocker is currently the only Ceedo product. It uses Ceedo application containers to create an isolated virtual environment and a security perimeter around the application and related data. Users can continue to use protected applications as they otherwise would, while all interactions between the application and the host computer are filtered through intelligent security checkpoints that ensure potential threats are confined to the container. The outcome is a protection measure that can be effective against all malware infections and is not dependent on threat detection. MalwareLocker is primarily sold to enterprises, and is used to protect their employees against web-borne threats. It is also used to secure endpoints from threats potentially coming from removable media or network. = Content Disarm & Reconstruction = Ceedo claims to have a partnership with leading firms in Content Disarm & Reconstruction field. This technology is used to supplement Ceedo containers and allow users to safely transfer files downloaded from the Internet. = Ceedo Cloud Management System = Ceedo Cloud Management System is a web-based management system that is sold together with MalwareLocker, allowing administrators to compose and configure policies for MalwareLocker units and assign them to remote users from a central location.

After some time, the repeated biting leaves the skin discolored and bloody. Dermatophagia (from Ancient Greek Œ¥Œ≠œÅŒºŒ± - skin - and œÜŒ±Œ≥ŒµŒØŒ± - eating) is a compulsion disorder of gnawing or biting one's own skin, most commonly at the fingers. This action can either be conscious or unconscious. Those affected with dermatophagia typically bite the skin around the nails, leading to bleeding and discoloration over time. Some people also bite on their skin on their finger knuckles which can lead to pain and bleeding just by moving their fingers. It has been proposed that dermatodaxia would be a more fitting term for this disorder, as the suffix-phagia' implies that the skin is being eaten rather than simply bitten. In most cases of dermatophagia in humans, the skin is only bitten with no consumption. In herpetology, dermatophagia is used to correctly describe the act in which amphibians and reptiles eat the skin they shed,Weldon, Paul (June 1993). \\"A Survey of Shed Skin-Eating in Amphibians and Reptiles\\". Journal of Herpetology. 27: 219‚Äì228 ‚Äì via JSTOR. but this is not what occurs in humans. Those diagnosed with this disorder do not develop wounds on the bitten areas of their hands or lose any skin. Instead, they experience a thickening of the skin being repeatedly bitten. This information implies that the skin is simply being bitten and chewed rather than eaten. Contemporary research suggests a link between impulse control disorders and obsessive‚Äìcompulsive disorders, and this was addressed in the DSM-5 when dermatophagia and other related disorders were classified as 'other specified obsessive-compulsive related disorders' and are given the specification of body focused repetitive behavior. Further information on OCD, other anxiety disorders, dermatophagia and other related body focused repetitive behaviors can be found in the DSM-5 Behavior People with dermatophagia chew their skin out of compulsion, and can do so on a variety of places on their body. Those with dermatophagia typically chew the skin surrounding their fingernails and joints. They also chew on the inside of their mouth, cheeks, and/or lips, causing blisters in and outside of the mouth. If the behavior is left unchecked for an extended period, calluses may start to develop where most of the biting is done. Skin chewing can be bolstered by times of apprehension and other unpleasant events. Blisters in particular can cause a feeling of desire to pull or bite off the affected skin and nails (since the skin is dead, thus easily pulled off), which could be detrimental, causing infection. Another disorder, known as excoriation disorder, the repetitive action of uncontrollably picking at one's skin, can sometimes accompany dermatophagia. Dermatophagia differs from excoriation disorder in that the repetitive motion affected persons partake in is the biting of the skin. People who have dermatophagia can also be prone to infection as when they bite their fingers so frequently, they make themselves vulnerable to bacteria seeping in and causing infection. Dermatophagia can be considered a \\"sister\\" disorder to trichophagia, which involves compulsively biting and eating one's hair. Management There is not yet a known way to remedy this in adults. Small things have been suggested to delay the urge a bit, such as chewing gum, and chewing on a soft drink straw. However, Cognitive-Behavioral Therapists recommend replacing things that do not actually dissolve with edibles that would. For example, using gum would prolong and likely worsen the anxiety as there is no end for the activity. Using a chocolate chip or a hard candy allows the sufferer to visualize their problem fading away, which may in turn help clear the mind. Decoupling in sensu has recently been shown to decrease the condition in a published single case trial. = Management in children with disabilities = There is no therapy known to effectively treat dermatophagia, but there have been attempts at stopping sufferers from being able to chew on their skin. One notable method that is currently in development is focused on in curbing dermatophagia in children with cerebral palsy. This method is known as the PLAY (Protecting Little and Adolescent hands) hands protective glove. This method of intervention involves small, non-invasive plastic brackets being placed around the affected fingers. These brackets do not hinder movement or tactile feedback, and they are constructed from non-toxic durable plastic that can withstand the force of chewing. Presently PLAY hands protective gloves exist in concept and prototype only, but this intervention method could improve the quality of life of those suffering from CP-induced dermatophagia. In popular culture In the movie Austin Powers in Goldmember, the titular villain eats flakes of his own skin that have already peeled off on their own (desquamation).

The wine must be made before the date of 1 March immediately following the harvest, and must reach an alcohol content of 11.5%. Since 2000, it has been possible to produce Barbera d'Asti Superiore, for which the wine must have an alcoholic strength of at least 12.5% by volume, and be aged for at least 14 months, 6 months of which stored in oak or chestnut barrels. Many superiore producers refine it in small oak barriques to obtain a rounder taste. The superiore has the following sub-zones indicated on the label: Nizza, Tinella, or Colli Astiani (Asti). The superiore wine has a strong additional aging potential; it can often be aged from ten to twenty years. The Nizza DOCG was added to Asti's Barbera portfolio in 2014. The Nizza production rules require the use of 100% Barbera grapes, a maximum yield of 7 tonnes per hectare, and minimum aging of 18 months, of which 6 months must be in oak barrels. The minimum alcoholic strength is 13%, or 13.5% if produced by a single, named vineyard.PDF Nizza DOCG Regulations, Consorzio Tutela Vini d'Asti e Monferrato, 29 October 2012 History The Barbera grape is believed to have originated in the hills of Monferrato in central Piedmont, Italy and is known from the thirteenth century. The first written proof of vinification is stored in the city hall of Nizza Monferrato and dates back to the seventeenth century. The wine enters officially in the role of Piedmontese wines in 1798, the date of the first Ampelography made by Giuseppe Nuvolone- Pergamo, count of Scandaluzza from the Societ√† Agraria di Torino (Agricultural Society of Turin). Barbera spread rapidly in the 19th and 20th centuries, and is today considered to be Piedmont's principal red grape variety.

The Johnston Center focuses on interdisciplinary education, in which students design the curriculum for their personal program of study. The program emphasizes cross-cultural learning, typically requiring the student to study abroad for at least a semester, and also emphasizes the importance of community interaction in its on-campus residential housing. Students have the ability to re-negotiate the content of courses they take; and to create courses. They write a self-evaluation at the end of each class and receive written evaluations rather than grades. History of Johnston Guided by the example of the Claremont College Consortium, in 1965 planning started for an experimental college attached to the University of Redlands. The intention was to develop a like consortium of colleges that would strengthen the reputation and resources of all member institutions. James Graham Johnston, of IBM, made the founding grant, and three new buildings were constructed exclusively for Johnston. The trustees hired Dr. Presley McCoy as the first Chancellor. An opportunity was made where unique thinkers, such as professors from Ivy League and top West Coast Universities who wanted less institutional constraint, could creatively interact with the educational desires of bright and talented students who sought with a unique perspective. Johnston College opened on September 2, 1969 with 89 male and 92 female students. Born in the midst of the Free Speech Movement, Johnston immediately became controversial. Chancellor McCoy declared, \\"We have the right to determine our own social rules\\" over the conventions of the University.Moore, Frank E. \\"Redlands, Our Town\\" Moore Historical Foundation, Redlands, CA 1987 Town and gown relations became further strained when McCoy hired Jeanne Friedman, an alleged Communist, as a faculty member, after her arrest for two felonies at Stanford. Johnston College lost support, and became a financial burden on the University, though it continued to operate as an autonomous unit for approximately 10 years. In 1979, it was integrated into the College of Arts and Sciences (CAS) as the Johnston Center for Individualized Studies. It operated under that name until the mid-1990s, when it was renamed The Johnston Center for Integrative Studies. Graduation contracts A Johnston Graduation Contract (abbreviated Grad contract) outlines what a student studies at Johnston. Written by the student as a proposal, then subject to review, it is made up of a narrative and a course list. The narrative is a short outline of what subjects the student wants to integrate and what they want to learn. The course list includes courses that have already been taken and courses that will be taken in order to fulfill the learning outlined in the narrative. A grad contract needs to satisfy the breath and depth expectations of the College of Arts and Sciences. Breadth means studying a broad array of subjects and fields (math, science, literature, religion, etc.). Traditional CAS students fulfill their breadth requirements by completing courses in the Liberal Arts Foundation (LAF). A Johnston student can negotiate how sufficient breadth will be achieved. Depth means having a deep understanding of the particular subjects that one wants to study. Traditional CAS students fulfill their depth requirement by completing a major. A Johnston student's depth comes in a personally designed emphasis. A grad contract also needs to include a cross cultural experience (CCE). Most students fulfill their CCE by traveling abroad usually in either their Junior or Senior years. A CCE is an opportunity in which the student experiences first-hand a culture that is not their own and helps them to understand the world from a cultural context outside of what they already know. For a grad contract to be passed the student goes before a Grad Contract Committee. The committee consists of the student's advisor, three other professors, and two Johnston students who have already had their grad contract passed. The committee reads the narrative before the meeting and asks the student questions about what they want to study and why and gives them ideas on how to increase their breadth and depth and gives them extra options to consider. If the committee feels that there is an integral component left out of the narrative and/or course list, the committee can make a stipulation (a demand of sorts) which the student must agree to before the contract is approved. Course contracts Johnston students can write contracts for most courses that they take (they need the professor's approval for traditional CAS courses). All students (including traditional CAS students) must take Johnston seminars for evaluation and must write a contract. With these contracts they can customize the course to meet their learning and educational needs; it is how the Johnston student takes responsibility and control of their education. The student can contract to do certain requirements outlined in the syllabus while substituting particular requirements in the syllabus with something else. For example, instead of taking quizzes a student could write a short paper or instead of taking a written final a student could take a dialogical final. Students can also increase the number of units the class is for by doing more work or decrease the number of units by doing less work, though either and any of these changes to a class syllabus must be negotiated between the student and the professor. Whenever a class is contracted, a student must write out a contract, a self- evaluation, and a professor evaluation. A copy of the contract is turned into the Johnston Registar, Teresa Area. Self-Evaluations are to be written at the end of the course and they should explain what the student studied, what they learned and how well they accomplished what they contracted to do. Self- Evaluations are very important so they should be as detailed as possible. Professor evaluations detail how well the professor taught and how useful they were in the learning experience. After the end of a course (and usually within about a semester) the student will receive an evaluation of how well they did in the course. Johnston students receive written evaluations from their professors instead of letter (A-F) or numerical (4.0-0.0) grades. Courses that are not Johnston seminars do not have to be taken for an evaluation and if the student so chooses they may take the course for a letter/numerical grade; but in most instances it is recommended that they are taken for evaluation. Johnston students are also encouraged, typically as part of finalizing their graduate contract, to teach or co-teach, a course that best exemplifies their accumulated knowledge base. While not a requirement, the communal nature of peer based classroom experiences is often seen as a senior capstone project, with a faculty adviser contributing to the intended syllabus. Previous courses taught by Johnston Students include (but are certainly not limited to!); Books That Make You Want To Write, Feminism in Literature, Media Bias, Woodworking Haphazardly, Survivalism, Ecology and Interactions, Ecofeminism, Industriomasculinity, Nietzsche's Philosophy, and Sustainable Agriculture. In addition to receiving a final written evaluation from the peer-professor pair, students are expected to write Self Evaluations aimed at improving instructor- student understanding of how the course, teacher, and student, met or failed to meet contract expectations. Community Many Johnston students take pride in living as part of an intentional community. Johnston has two dorms, Bekins Hall and Bekins-Holt Hall (often known as Holt Hall), which are collectively known as the Johnston Complex. Community meetings are held every Tuesday at 4pm. At these meetings, community members (students and faculty) discuss current developments in the social and educational operation of the Johnston Center, and consider proposals for the use of student funds held for collectively agreed-upon projects such as art shows. Smoking cigarettes was once allowed on the balcony of Bekins Hall but was banned following a fire in 2006.

It is known as the \\"Gateway to the Rhenish-Hessian Switzerland\\", as the region is called.  Geography  = Location = Bornheim is nestled in a hollow, sheltered by the Oswaldsh√∂he (heights). The municipality lies in Rhenish Hesse. Its main winemaking appellation ‚Äì Weingro√ülage ‚Äì is Adelberg.  History  In 767 or 768, Bornheim had its first documentary mention in a donation document from Lorsch Abbey. Archaeological finds, however, make it clear that the village existed earlier. Graves for cremated remains and a Frankish row graveyard from about AD 500 have been found in the municipality. The Oswaldsh√∂he is thought to have served as an early gathering place for Germanic peoples. The church was first mentioned in 1241 and partly destroyed by French troops in 1690. The tower with its wall paintings from the 13th century, however, remained standing. It also houses Rhenish Hesse‚Äôs oldest bell. Like the surrounding municipalities, Bornheim belonged to the Waldgraves in the Early Middle Ages, and beginning in 1671 to their kin, the Rheingrafen (‚ÄúRhine Counts‚Äù). After the Napoleonic Wars, the municipality passed, as part of Rhenish Hesse, to the Grand Duchy of Hesse-Darmstadt. On 31 December 1871, the railway arrived. Passenger service on the Armsheim - Bornheim - Flonheim - Wendelsheim line (Wiesbachtalbahn), though, was ended in 1966, and since then the line has been completely abandoned. After the First World War, French troops built a munitions depot right next to the railway line. In the Second World War, several bombs fell in the local area, which luckily did no great damage. After 1961, Bornheim became known as the ‚ÄúVillage of Roses and Wine‚Äù. At this time, 5,000 climbing roses were planted. This was surely the reason why in 1973, at the national level, the municipality won gold in the contest Unser Dorf soll sch√∂ner werden (‚ÄúOur village should become lovelier‚Äù), and was long said to be Rhenish Hesse‚Äôs prettiest municipality. The municipality‚Äôs favourable location for transport, having its own interchange on the A 61, and the affordable property prices have led to quick growth over the last few years, such that there are now 825 inhabitants (as at 31 December 2006).

New Orleans, Louisiana, is especially known for its strong association with jazz music, universally considered to be the birthplace of the genre. The earliest form was dixieland, which has sometimes been called traditional jazz, 'New Orleans', and 'New Orleans jazz'. However, the tradition of jazz in New Orleans has taken on various forms that have either branched out from original dixieland or taken entirely different paths altogether. New Orleans has also been a prominent center of funk, home to some of the earliest funk bands such as The Meters. Early 19th century The African influence on New Orleans music can trace its roots at least back to Congo Square in New Orleans in 1835, when slaves would congregate there to play music and dance on Sundays. African music was played as well as local music, including that of local white composers, such as Louis Moreau Gottschalk. Along with European musical forms that were popular in the city, including the brass band traditions, the cultural mix laid the groundwork for the New Orleans musical art forms to come. By 1838, the local paper‚Äîthe daily Picayune‚Äîran a scathing article complaining about the emergence of brass bands in the city, which it stated could be found on every corner. Jazz 320x320px The term \\"jazz\\" (early on often spelled \\"jass\\") did not become popular until the mid and late 1910s, when New Orleans musicians first rose to prominence in other parts of the USA and the New Orleans style needed a new name to differentiate it from the nationally popular ragtime. Before then, the New Orleans style was frequently simply called \\"ragtime\\" (Sidney Bechet continued to call his music \\"ragtime\\" throughout his life), along with such local terms as \\"hot music\\" and \\"ratty music\\". The local New Orleans dance music style was already distinctive in the 19th century. When this style became what was later known as \\"jazz\\" remains a matter of debate and definition, although most New Orleans music historians believe what became known as New Orleans style jazz was the product of a series of developments, probably reaching its famous form no earlier than the 1890s and no later than the mid 1910s. By the 1890s a man by the name of Poree hired a band led by cornetist Buddy Bolden, many of whose contemporaries as well as many jazz historians consider to be the first prominent jazz musician. The music was not called jazz at this time, consisting of marching band music with brass instruments and dancing. If anything, Bolden could be said to have been a blues player. The actual term \\"jazz\\" was first \\"jass\\", the etymology of which is still not entirely clear. The connotation is sexual in nature, as many of the early performers played in rough working class venues. Despite colorful stories of mid-20th century writers, the prostitution district known as Storyville was no more important in the development of the music than the city's other neighborhoods, but did play a role in exposing some out of town visitors to the style. Many instruments used were often acquired second-hand at pawn shops, including used military band instruments. The Creole people of New Orleans also contributed greatly to the evolution of the artform, though their own music became heavily influenced by the pioneering work of Bolden. New Orleans-born musicians such as Louis Armstrong, Sidney Bechet and Jelly Roll Morton all recalled the influence Bolden had on the direction of the music of New Orleans (Armstrong himself had no memory of Bolden, but was told about him by his mentor King Oliver) and jazz itself. =Sicilian influence= New Orleans had experienced a large wave of migration from the Italian region of Sicily between the late 1800s and early 1900s. The Sicilian capital of Palermo had long held cotton and citrus fruit trade with New Orleans. This resulted in the establishment of a direct shipping line between the two port cities which enabled a vast number of Sicilians to migrant to New Orleans, as well as other American cities. As a result of this migration, much of New Orleans jazz was modeled from the music of Sicily.https://www.lavocedinewyork.com/en/arts/2018/05/19/jazz-the-sicily-new- orleans-connection-and-the-art-of-encounter-par-excellence/ This was shown in the New Orleans group the Original Dixieland Jass Band. Bandleader Nick LaRocca and drummer Tony Sbarbaro were both born to parents who were Sicilian migrants. The band's \\"Livery Stable Blues\\" became the first jazz record ever issued. =Cuban influence= African American music began incorporating Afro- Cuban musical motifs in the nineteenth century, when the habanera (Cuban contradanza) gained international popularity. The habanera was the first written music to be rhythmically based on an African motif. From the perspective of African American music, the habanera rhythm (also known as congo,Manuel, Peter (2009: 69). Creolizing Contradance in the Caribbean. Philadelphia: Temple University Press. tango-congo,Acosta, Leonardo (2003: 5). Cubano Be Cubano Bop; One Hundred Years of Jazz in Cuba. Washington D.C.: Smithsonian Books. or tango.Maule√≥n (1999: 4) Salsa Guidebook for Piano and Ensemble. Petaluma, California: Sher Music. .) can be thought of as a combination of tresillo and the backbeat.Pe√±alosa, David (2010: 42). The Clave Matrix; Afro-Cuban Rhythm: Its Principles and African Origins. Redway, CA: Bembe Inc. . Louis Moreau Gottschalk, c. 1855‚Äì1865 Musicians from Havana and New Orleans would take the twice-daily ferry between both cities to perform and not surprisingly, the habanera quickly took root in the musically fertile Crescent City. John Storm Roberts states that the musical genre habanera, \\"reached the U.S. 20 years before the first rag was published\\" (1999: 12).Roberts, John Storm (1999: 12) Latin Jazz. New York: Schirmer Books. The symphonic work La nuit des tropiques (lit. \\"Night of the Tropics\\") by New Orleans native Louis Moreau Gottschalk, was influenced by the composer's studies in Cuba.Sublette, Ned (2008:125). Cuba and its Music; From the First Drums to the Mambo. Chicago: Chicago Review Press. Gottschalk used the tresillo variant cinquillo extensively. With Gottschalk, we see the beginning of serious treatment of Afro-Caribbean rhythmic elements in New World art music. For the more than quarter-century in which the cakewalk, ragtime, and proto-jazz were forming and developing, the habanera was a consistent part of African American popular music.Roberts, John Storm (1999: 16) Latin Jazz. New York: Schirmer Books. Whether tresillo was directly transplanted from Cuba, or if the habanera merely reinforced tresillo-like \\"rhythmic tendencies\\" already present in New Orleans music is probably impossible to determine. It is reasonable to assume that tresillo-based rhythms were performed in Congo Square by Caribbean slaves. There are examples of tresillo-like rhythms in a few African American folk musics such as the foot stomping patterns in ring shout and the post-Civil War drum and fife music.Kubik, Gerhard (1999: 52). Africa and the Blues. Jackson, MI: University Press of Mississippi. Tresillo is also heard prominently in New Orleans second line music. Jelly Roll Morton in 1917‚Äì1918Early New Orleans jazz bands had habaneras in their repertoire and the tresillo/habanera figure was a rhythmic staple of jazz at the turn of the 20th century. Comparing the music of New Orleans with the music of Cuba, Wynton Marsalis observes that tresillo is the New Orleans \\"clave\\".\\"Wynton Marsalis part 2.\\" 60 Minutes. CBS News (26 Jun 2011). Although technically, the pattern is only half a clave, Marsalis makes the important point that the single-celled figure is the guide-pattern of New Orleans music. The New Orleans musician Jelly Roll Morton considered the tresillo/habanera (which he called the Spanish tinge) to be an essential ingredient of jazz.Roberts, John Storm 1979. The Latin tinge: the impact of Latin American music on the United States. Oxford. The habanera rhythm and tresillo can be heard in his left hand on songs like \\"The Crave\\" (1910, recorded 1938). Morton stated, \\"Now in one of my earliest tunes, \\"New Orleans Blues\\", you can notice the Spanish tinge. In fact, if you can't manage to put tinges of Spanish in your tunes, you will never be able to get the right seasoning, I call it, for jazz.\\"Morton, \\"Jelly Roll\\" (1938: Library of Congress Recording) The Complete Recordings By Alan Lomax. Although the exact origins of jazz syncopation may never be known, there's evidence that the habanera/tresillo rhythm was there at its conception. Buddy Bolden, the first known jazz musician, is credited with creating the big four, the first syncopated bass drum pattern to deviate from the standard on-the-beat march.Marsalis, Wynton (2000: DVD n.1). Jazz. PBS As the example below shows,\\"Jazz and Math: Rhythmic Innovations\\", PBS.org.

New York: Oxford Press. = Second line = The use of brass marching bands came long before jazz music through their use in the military, though in New Orleans many of the best-known musicians had their start in brass marching bands performing dirges as well as celebratory and upbeat tunes for New Orleans jazz funeral processions from the 1890s onward. The tradition drove onward with musicians such as Louis Armstrong, Henry \\"Red\\" Allen and King Oliver. The presence of marching bands lives on today in New Orleans, with musicians such as the Marsalis family doing some of their earliest work in such bands.\\"Ibid\\"; Jazz: The Rough Guide, p. 738 Much of New Orleans music today owes its debt to the early marching bands, even those marching bands which predate the birth of jazz music. In the late 19th century marching bands would often march through the streets of the city in second line parades. Some of the earliest bands originated from the Trem√© neighborhood, and the city gave birth to such bands as the Excelsior, Onward and Olympia brass bands. The Onward and Olympia bands each have sustained incarnations that continue performing to this day. Modern examples of the brass band tradition can be heard in the playing of groups like the Dirty Dozen Brass Band, or the Rebirth Brass Band founded by Phillip \\"Tuba Phil\\" Frazier, Keith Frazier, and Kermit Ruffins. The history of the marching band in New Orleans is a rich one, with the various bands performing at virtually every major social event the city has to offer. They perform at funerals, picnics, carnivals and parades. The relationship between jazz bands and brass bands is one of co-influence. Jazz bands of this era began to go beyond the confines of the 6/8 time signature the marching bands utilized. Instead, New Orleans jazz bands began incorporating a style known as \\"ragging\\"; this technique implemented the influence of ragtime 2/4 meter and eventually led to improvisation. In turn, the early jazz bands of New Orleans influenced the playing of the marching bands, who in turn began to improvise themselves more often. Again, yet another indication that jazz music is symbolic of freedom. = Dixieland = The term dixieland was first coined by Dan Emmett in his song \\"Dixie's Land\\" in 1859. It was not a positive term for African-Americans, as its usage defined any area of the south where slaves had not yet received emancipation. Dixieland music can be defined in a number of ways, though its origin is to be found in New Orleans, present first in the music of King Oliver. It quickly spread north and became popularized along with the migration of southern blacks to areas like Chicago. Today the term is used in reference to the music, which provides a general description of any form of jazz that is derived from early New Orleans jazz. The term dixieland is generally not used very much by New Orleans-based musicians, for there is good evidence that the term was imposed on them. For instance, the first band to actually use the term in reference to the music in their name was the all- white Original Dixieland Band. This band played no small role in the coinage of the term dixieland in reference to jazz in New Orleans, though they were not the innovators of the music. The only true barrier this band broke was being the first to record New Orleans music, which happened in New York City of all places in 1917. Despite the criticism Paul Barnes made about them, he also said that they had a \\"first class band\\". An early student of Dixieland was the young Louis Prima, as well as his older brother Leon, both of whom lived outside the French Quarter in a working-class neighborhood populated by Italian-American and African-American musicians. Into his early 20s, Louis Prima performed on trumpet and cornet throughout New Orleans before following in the path of his idol Armstrong, and moving North for career reasons, where he appeared at the Famous Door in New York City, eventually relocating to Las Vegas where, beginning in the mid-1950s, he regularly appeared with another New Orleans musician, saxophonist Sam Butera. Rhythm & blues and rock & roll  Dave Bartholomew in 1977 A new style came out of New Orleans after World War II. Prominent musicians such as Fats Domino helped shape what was first widely known as \\"Rhythm and Blues\\", which was an important ancestor of rock and roll, if not the first form of the music. In addition to the local talent, early rockers from elsewhere recorded many of their early hits in New Orleans using bands of New Orleans musicians. In 1949, New Orleans jazz musician, and Fats Domino producer Dave Bartholomew brought the tresillo directly from Cuban music into early R&B.; In a 1988 interview with Robert Palmer, Bartholomew revealed how he initially superimposed tresillo over swing rhythm. Bartholomew referred to the Cuban son by the misnomer rumba, a common practice of that time. On Bartholomew's 1949 tresillo-based \\"Oh Cubanas\\" we clearly hear an attempt to blend African American and Afro-Cuban music. Hip-hop Pivotal in the emergence of New Orleans into the mainstream hip hop community was the establishment of No Limit Records (now New No Limit Records) and Cash Money Records. These labels produced dozens of albums by young New Orleans rappers beginning in the mid-1990s. Some seminal New Orleans artists from No Limit included Mia X, Mystikal, Master P, Soulja Slim, C-Murder, and Silkk the Shocker. Cash Money likewise signed and released albums by several New Orleans artists including BG, Juvenile, Turk, Big Tymers, and Lil' Wayne. The city is also the birthplace of bounce music which is gaining popularity. Former Cash Money in-house producer Mannie Fresh is often credited for much of the popularity for Bounce outside of New Orleans. Drake, also signed to Cash Money recently collaborated with New Orleans Bounce producer Blaqnmild on his international hits \\"Nice For What\\" and \\"In My Feelings\\". Jay Electronica, signed to Jay-Z's Roc Nation record label, has projected into the hip-hop scene. Eastside New Orleans Rapper Currensy resides in New Orleans. Rappers Corner Boy P, Young Roddy, Trademark Da Skydiver, and Fiend are from New Orleans. Most of the Jet Life collective is from New Orleans or surrounding areas. New Orleans is also known for a hip hop duo known as the $UICIDEBOY$, who are known for rapping about suicide and depression, hence their name. Heavy metal New Orleans has an active metal scene which began to take real form in the late 1980s. Bands such as Eyehategod, Down, Exhorder, Crowbar, Acid Bath, Soilent Green, Goatwhore, Kingdom of Sorrow, Graveyard Rodeo and Superjoint Ritual are either based in the city, or have a majority of their members hailing from the area. Artists such as Mike Williams, Jimmy Bower, Brian Patton, Phil Anselmo, Kirk Windstein, Pepper Keenan, Pat Bruders, Stanton Moore and Kyle Thomas are New Orleans residents. The city is known for the \\"Louisiana sound\\", which was pioneered by Exhorder, who was the first band to combine doom metal and up-tempo thrash metal. As a result, New Orleans is often recognized as the place where sludge metal was born. Several of these metal groups share a style which draws inspiration from Black Sabbath, Melvins, hardcore punk as well as Southern rock. There is still variance within the sounds of the scene, however. Eyehategod features very harsh vocals and guitar distortion; Down has a style closer to classic rock; Crowbar's music has mostly slow tempos and a downtuned guitar sound; and Soilent Green has a sound which is closer to grindcore. It's quite usual for a member of one of these bands to be part of another band from New Orleans or Louisiana. Collaborations by members of a band on another are also fairly common. In addition to being one of the founding members of Eyehategod, Jimmy Bower is also a member of Down, a member of Superjoint Ritual and has worked several times with Crowbar. Pepper Keenan, member of Corrosion of Conformity, is a member of Down and also worked on Eyehategod's album Dopesick.Williams, Mike. Dopesick. Recording notes on the 2007 European reedition.

She began writing in 1914 at the age of 50 and continued until her death after a long illness in 1951.Time Magazine Obituaries, March 26, 1951 After her death, her estate was managed by her sons, Selden M. and Robert M. Loring, who, based on a wealth of unfinished material they discovered, published twenty more books under her name until 1972. These books were ghost-written by Elinore Denniston. Personal life Emilie Loring was born in Boston, Massachusetts in 1866 to George M. Baker and Emily Frances (Boles) Baker. Her father was a playwright and publisher and her mother was a homemaker. Loring married Victor J. Loring, who was a lawyer.Emilie Loring Reference Page, vol. 51, edited by Anne Commire. Gale Research, 1988. pp. 103-104. She died in Wellesley, Massachusetts on March 13, 1951. At the time of her death, Loring had sold more than a million copies of her first thirty books. Loring's sister, Rachel Baker Gale, wrote a number of suffrage parlor plays. Loring's son, Selden M. Loring was also an author. He wrote Young Buckskin Spy (Lantern Press, 1954) and Mighty Magic: An Almost- True Story of Pirates and Indians (Holliday House, 1964). The papers of Emilie Loring are housed in the Department of Special Collections, Boston University, Mugar Memorial Library.Website of the archives of the Department of Special Collections, Mugar Memorial Library, Boston University Works The majority of Loring's books are highly romantic mysteries that focus on a young, independent woman with courage and ideals who finds herself in a tricky situation, relies on the help of a strong, handsome man and ends up with him at the end of the story. Beyond romance and mystery, her books also explore a selection of topics including marriage, love, the work ethic, American patriotism, freedom and optimism. She enjoyed painting pictures with words, often describing the environment, architecture, dress, food and physical features of characters in exacting and colorful detail. In the books published after she died, a lot of the colorful description was left out. Another major difference in the books published before and after the author's death is the characters' language, a change for the better. In a lot of the early books, too many of the characters use American slang, which sounds like it came straight from the early talkies. Loring's work features several repeating motifs; among them are a heroine in her early '20s with dark hair, a dark- haired lawyer or aspiring politician for a hero, a secondary male predisposed to speaking in quotations, a \\"sleek\\" bad guy, a wise older woman who may or may not end up with a wise older man who has long been in love with her, a flirtatious blond woman vying for the hero and New England as a setting or character trait: \\"New England granite.\\" Often-used plot devices in her novels include an orphaned character, a marriage of convenience or contract, a clandestine marriage and trouble coming from outside a well-knit social structure.

Reportedly, Moorish or Byzantine style influences can be made out in this Romanesque tower. It is often described as the loveliest of its kind in Rhenish Hesse. The spire with its 16-sided cupola top supposedly bears some relation to the Hohenstaufen Rhinelands to the east and it belongs to a group of similar spires in Rhenish Hesse, such as Alsheim, Guntersblum and Saint Paul‚Äôs Church in Worms.

History Toward the end of the 19th century, the Russian Academy of Sciences sought to build a general-purpose research vessel for long-term expeditions. The first such Russian ship‚Äîand, for a couple of decades, the only one‚Äîwas Zarya. In 1899, Baron Eduard Toll, an Arctic explorer preparing to embark on a new polar voyage, bought a Norwegian three-masted barque called Harald Harfager (the nickname of a King of Norway) for the cost of 60,000 rubles. Toll was helped in his choice by Fridtjof Nansen, who recommended to use a ship similar to his Fram. The ship had a displacement of 450 tonnes and a draught of 5 meters. Renamed Zarya, the ship was sent to the shipyard of Colin Archer in Larvik to be heavily modified in order to deal with the ice. Colin Archer, the renowned Norwegian shipbuilder, had designed and built Fritdjof Nansen's ship Fram, which in 1896 had returned unscathed from its long drift in the northern polar ocean during Nansen's \\"Farthest North\\" expedition, 1893‚Äì96. Archer had also fitted out Southern Cross for the Southern Cross Expedition in 1897 to become a polar ship. Archer strengthened Zarja heavily with internal frames and beams and deckhouses were added and modified. The rig was changed to barkentine (square sail on foremast only). In October 1899 the ship was certified by Norwegian authorities for a three-year expedition in the Arctic. =Russian Polar Expedition= On June 21, 1900, Zarya left Saint Petersburg with a crew of 20. N. N. Kolomeitsev was the commander of the ship. On July 24 she arrived at the harbour of Alexandrovsk on Murman (today Polyarny) and then continued toward the Kara Sea. Zarya made her first wintering trapped in the ice of a bay that Toll named after Colin Archer shipyard (Bukhta Kolin Archera) near Taymyr Island. The scientists spent 11 months researching the Nordenski√∂ld Archipelago and the Taymyr Peninsula coast. In the spring Kolomeitsev was sent on a long sledge trip by expedition leader Eduard Toll, and at this point second-in-command, Fyodor Andreyevich Matisen became the captain for the remaining part of the expedition. Member of the expedition was Aleksandr Kolchak. In August 1901 the ship headed across the Laptev Sea towards the New Siberian Islands, searching for the legendary Sannikov Land (Zemlya Sannikova), but was soon blocked by floating pack ice. During 1902 the attempts to reach Sannikov Land continued while Zarya was trapped in fast ice. Leaving the ship, Baron Toll and three companions went in search of the elusive land, one of the main objects of the expedition. They vanished in November 1902 while travelling away from Bennett Island towards the south on loose ice floes. Badly beaten by the ice, and beyond any hope of repair, Zarya was finally moored east of the delta of the river Lena, in the Bay of Tiksi on the lee side of Brusneva Island, never to leave the place again. Instead of the Russian flag, she flew the flag of the Neva Yacht Club, the oldest yacht club in Russia, until she was stripped of all equipment and her hull was allowed to fill with water. Captain Matisen returned to Yakutsk and the remaining members of the expedition left for Saint Petersburg. { - valign=\\"top\\" Crew of Zarya Instead of the Russian flag, Zarya flew this flag of the Neva Yacht Club until her last moments.

It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of W√∂rrstadt, whose seat is in the like-named municipality.  Geography  = Location = The municipality lies in Rhenish Hesse. = Climate = Yearly precipitation in Ensheim amounts to , which is in the upper third of the precipitation chart for all Germany, as measured at the German Weather Service‚Äôs weather stations. At 74% of the stations, lower figures are recorded. The driest month is February. The most rainfall comes in November. Precipitation varies little from month to month, though, with seasonal swings falling into the lower third. At only 14% of all places are seasonal swings in precipitation less marked. Precipitation diagram  History  As early as the mid 4th century, the Franks broke through the fortified Roman border at the Rhine, winning themselves a new homeland in so doing. Rhenish Hesse was occupied by the Franks in the 5th century. The oldest available written evidence about Ensheim from Frankish times comes from the year 769. On 12 September 769, a man named Almahar, who might have been Ensheim‚Äôs landholder, donated a vineyard in the municipal area of Aoenisheim ‚Äì today‚Äôs Ensheim ‚Äì to Lorsch Abbey. This Almahar also crops up as a witness in a document from Flonheim from 12 June 791 and endowed Lorsch Abbey with further donations. The first documentary mention in 769 also brings evidence that Roman winegrowing was still being practised. Ensheim‚Äôs name has taken many forms over the ages, and the following ones are found in documents: :785 ‚Äì Gennesheim :849 ‚Äì Onesheim :1224 ‚Äì Ennensheim :1283 ‚Äì Onisheim :1299 ‚Äì Ensenthaim :1337 ‚Äì Onesheim :1375 ‚Äì Onsheim :1437 ‚Äì One√üheim Ensheim originally belonged to the Wormsgau and passed with the formation of territorial lordly domains in the 12th century to the Counts Palatine. The time when the Palatine Principality was newly formed by Emperor Friedrich Barbarossa might well also be when Stromberg Castle in the Soonwald (part of the Hunsr√ºck) came into the Count Palatine‚Äôs ownership. To Stromberg belonged, besides Ensheim, the Kronkreuz estate and the villages of Appenheim, Engelstadt, Grolsheim, Horrweiler, Weinheim and Schimsheim. Once Count Palatine Otto divided his holdings between his sons Ludwig and Heinrich in 1255, the former acquired the village of Ensheim. His son Rudolf and Rudolf‚Äôs wife Mathilde undertook a pledge in 1311 of the castles and villages to Simon II of Sponheim for 2,000 pounds in Hellers. This pledge was redeemed in 1320 by the widow Mathilde and her son Adolf, whereby Ensheim passed back to the Electorate of the Palatinate, staying with it until the French Revolution. In Ensheim, the Cistercian Saint John‚Äôs Monastery (St. Johanneskloster) near Alzey owned an estate, which was mentioned in 1357. This estate had its taxes and assessment duties, all but corn tributes, lifted on 28 February 1357 by Count Palatine Rupprecht II, to whom these hitherto had had to be paid. After this pronouncement, the Counts Palatine had lodging rights at this estate with stabling for their horses. Food and drink, as well as fodder for their horses, had to be supplied by Ensheim citizens. After the monastery was dissolved in 1560, the municipality of Ensheim acquired the estate. = Religion = *The Ensheim Evangelical parish was until 1998 an autonomous parish with its own rectorate, which also managed neighbouring Spiesheim‚Äôs Evangelical inhabitants. Beginning in 1999, the municipalities of Bechtolsheim, Biebelnheim, Ensheim and Spiesheim together form a parish whose seat is in Bechtolsheim. The Catholic inhabitants form a daughter parish of the Catholic parish of Spiesheim, both of which are governed together by the parish region of W√∂rrstadt.

It is not handed down from local history, but rather the charges relate to territorial allegiances over the ages. The official German blazon reads: √úber von Silber und Rot gespaltenem erh√∂htem Schildfu√ü, darin rechts eine blaue Lilie, links ein silbernes Sesel, von Rot und Silber gespalten, rechts eine silberne Hacke und ein silberner Krummstab mit Sudarium, gekreuzt, links eine blaue Krone mit einem herauswachsenden blauen Kleeblattkreuz. The municipality‚Äôs arms might be described thus in English heraldic language: Quarterly per fess abased, first argent a crown charged with a cross bottonn√©e azure, second gules a crozier with sudarium and a hoe per saltire of the first, third gules a billhook palewise of the first, fourth argent a fleur-de-lis of the second. The arms show Ensheim‚Äôs former allegiance to the Electorate of the Palatinate and has retained the Rhenish-Hessian and Mainz tinctures gules and argent (red and silver). The crown with the cross refers to the Kronkreuz estate, which was within Ensheim‚Äôs municipal limits, and which passed in 1299 to Mainz Cathedral, while in the village itself, the Marian monastery at Flonheim held rights and ownership, as shown by the blue lily, Mary‚Äôs symbol. The Mainz Episcopal Church‚Äôs holdings and rights are likewise shown by the crozier. The hoe and the billhook refer to agriculture and winegrowing. Thus the arms unite the municipality‚Äôs present-day economic structure with its historic past as well as with an interpretation of the old monasterial estate‚Äôs name, Kronkreuz, which means ‚ÄúCrown Cross‚Äù, making the charge in the first quarter canting. = Town partnerships = * Dommartemont, Meurthe-et-Moselle, France  Culture and sightseeing = Music = * Men‚Äôs singing club = Regular events = * Kachelbergfest * Brunnenfest (‚ÄúFountain festival‚Äù)  References   External links  * Municipality‚Äôs official webpage Category:Rhenish Hesse Category:Alzey-Worms ","title":"Ensheim"},{"id":"11787418","text":"Lake Gogebic ( ) is the largest natural inlandHanchin, P.

The finding was made in deposits of the prehistoric Rhine river and are about 10 million years old. These deposits are known as the Deinotherium Sands, because they often contain teeth and bones from the extinct proboscid Deinotherium. In October 2017, scientists from the Natural History Museum at Mainz reported that two teeth about 5 to 8 million years old had been found in 2016, that resemble those of extinct human relatives Ardipithecus ramidus and Australopithecus afarensis. Early reactions to the \\"Eppelsheim teeth\\" ranged from interest to dismissal while the researchers indicated that they will continue their investigations and analysis. = Dinotherium Museum = The Dinotherium-Museum in Eppelsheim shows original finds of fossil mammals from local deposits. One attraction at the Dinotherium-Museum is the cast of a Deinotherium skull that was unearthed in 1835 near Eppelsheim. The Dinotherium-Museum was former mayor Heiner Roos's brainchild. = Buildings =  Village dyke  The Dorfgraben, also called the Effenring, was a heart-shaped ditch that surrounded the mediaeval village, serving along with its banked walls as both a flood ditch and a village fortification. Its beginnings seem to have brought woes, though. History records only one dispute, in the late 14th century, between the von Dalberg family and the municipality. One family member claimed part of the dyke as his own. The ensuing negotiations ended with a compromise: one part each was allotted to the von Dalberg family and the municipality. The four roads leading out of the village in the cardinal compass directions were particularly well secured with portcullises at the four gates (Pforten), (the Hangen-Weisheimer Pforte, the Flomborner Pforte, the Dintesheimer Pforte and the Alzeyer Pforte). At the dawn of the 20th century, the dyke had become overgrown mainly with elms and since 11 March 1927 it has been a protected natural monument called the Effenkranz (‚ÄúElm Wreath‚Äù), or sometimes the Allee. Dutch elm disease, however, did not spare the Effenkranz, and between 1976 and 1981, all elms had to be felled, and they were replaced with 550 other trees.  Dalberg Tower  The Dalberger Turm was built about 1500 by the Chamberlains Dalberg from Worms, who nonetheless never lived in Eppelsheim, as a defensive tower and a dwelling for the Cathedral Foundation at Worms. It is nowadays under private ownership. In old documents, the Dalberger Turm is described as the \\"Wasserhaus\\" (‚ÄúWaterhouse‚Äù), because there was a moat around the tower, fed by the nearby village dyke. The building has walls wholly built out of quarrystones (limestone) and covers a ground area of some 10 m √ó 10 m. Besides the ground floor, there are also five upper floors. The ground floor‚Äôs walls are some 1.5 m thick. Once, the only way in was through the first of the upper floors by way of a ladder or movable stairway. The tower was surrounded by a further wall with a parapet walk, and was part of the village‚Äôs fortifications. The roof, converted in 1602, was originally steeper; the less steep tent roof comes from a later time. Windows and arrowslits are framed with red sandstone. Heating facilities could not be ascertained, and therefore the tower‚Äôs use as a dwelling, at least in times of danger, must be assumed (it was later used as a warehouse and a fruit store). The Dalberger Turm and the townscape with the village walls have since 30 September 1988 been under the protection of the Hague Conventions.

Geography  = Location = West of Alzey, in Rhenish Hesse, at an elevation of 250 m lies Erbes-B√ºdesheim, a place marked by distinctive geological features, botanical singularities and a great number of surprising historical facts. It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Alzey-Land, whose seat is in Alzey. = Geology = In terms of Earth's history, the village lies on what the geologists call the Vorholz Peninsula, which some 40 to 30 million years ago almost always rose up out of the sea.  History  As long ago as the New Stone Age (4500‚Äì1800 BC), this place was settled, and likewise in the early (700‚Äì450 BC) and late Iron Age (450 - 15 BC), as shown by many finds. There was also settlement in Roman times, and unearthed in 1909 was a whole Frankish burial ground. The place where Erbes-B√ºdesheim now lies was therefore settled through a great length of time ‚Äì albeit likely with interruptions. On 2 to 4 January 767, the village had its first documentary mention, and likewise the then-standing village church, Saint Michael's (Michaels-Kirche) between 767 and 768. The first inhabitant whose name is known was one Egilolf, who on the date mentioned sold Lorsch Abbey, which stood on the river Rhine across from Worms, ten Joch (about 3.5 ha) of cropland, for which he received one horse. To this faithful, precise noting of this sale by the monks, Erbes- B√ºdesheim owes its first documentary mention, and likewise, almost all Rhenish Hesse's villages had their first documentary mention in such a way. = 12th to 13th century = Fully 37 monasteries and noble families had landholdings in the village in the centuries that followed, and were therefore the landlords. The history of the local lords is quite complicated. Erbes- B√ºdesheim originally wholly belonged as a village about 1275 to the County of Leiningen, beginning in 1350 to the ‚ÄúFurther‚Äù and ‚ÄúHinder‚Äù County of Sponheim, whose main holdings lay in the Hunsr√ºck, and after the House of Sponheim died out in 1437, to their heirs: the County of Palatinate-Simmern, the Margraviate of Baden and Electoral Palatinate. From 1559 to 1598 and from 1611 to 1673, it belonged to the Duchy of Palatinate-Simmern, a small Electoral Palatinate sideline whose seat was in Simmern, and beginning in 1673, wholly to Electoral Palatinate. Among the village's peculiarities are the ancient stone crosses on Offenheimer Stra√üe and Nacker Stra√üe (streets), the former lake in the municipal area's east to which field names still refer, the Eicherwald (forest) in the northwest and its very ancient lot division, the quicksilver mine in the far northwest below the Eicherwald and the gallows in the east at the municipal limit with Heimersheim (an outlying centre of Alzey). = 14th to 15th century = The village itself was safeguarded against attack by the Late Middle Ages, girded as it was by its village wall, which also had before it a water-filled dyke and an earthen berm overgrown with elm trees. The Obertor (Upper Gate) in the south and the Untertor (Lower Gate) in the north kept the village safe. Erbes-B√ºdesheim earns special noteworthiness in having had two castles, the Wei√ües Schloss in the south and the Blaue Burg in the northwest. *The Wei√ües Schloss in the south with its thus far 32 owners had already been built by 1354, at which time the knight Dietz Birkenfelder from F√ºrfeld lived there, and thereafter and for a long time the family of the Lords of Morsheim (Morschheim). *The Blaue Burg in the northwest between the end of Pankratiushofstra√üe and Grabengasse, of which only two tower remnants are still standing today, was built before 1488, and quite likely destroyed in 1504 in the Landshut War of Succession. The plot of land known as Das blaue Schloss at the west end of Niedergasse belonged, as it were, as a bailey, to the Blaue Burg. Near this ‚ÄúBlue Castle‚Äù was a prison in 1590, which earlier (1533‚Äì1560) had been known as a Stock (‚Äústaff‚Äù, ‚Äústick‚Äù or ‚Äútrunk‚Äù). The Untere Kirchgasse (‚ÄúLower Church Lane‚Äù) was also called Hundsgasse, not after a dog (Hund in German), but rather after one Hundo, a prison official, who might well have been the one to lead condemned prisoners, who were imprisoned in the village's west end, along the Hundsgasse to the gallows in the east. Three little outlying villages once stood around Erbes-B√ºdesheim, and their land areas were later annexed by Erbes-B√ºdesheim. They were Aulheim in the north, Eyche in the northwest and Riede (also called Rode) in the west. Aulheim had its Saint Nicholas's Chapel and two mills that still stand today, and Eyche a church in which the Catholics from Nack worshipped and had a priest to look after their spiritual needs. As for Riede, the names of some buildings and plots of land are still known, as are two inhabitants‚Äô names. = 16th to 18th century = The village of Nack itself had its first documentary mention in 1304. It had two well known estates, the Antoniterhof (also called Th√∂ngeshof or Pfalzhof) and the Hunolsteiner Hof, the latter of which belonged to the Vogt of Hunolstein and formed a stone-marked domain unto itself, meaning that it was not under Nack's authority. In the village's southwest lay the quicksilver mine, Karlsgrube (also called Karlsgl√ºck), from which in 1774 another 355 Pfund (old German pounds) of the liquid metal was brought to light. Although Nack was said to be a part of Erbes-B√ºdesheim until 1821 and only became politically autonomous in 1822, acquiring its own mayor, the place already had Schulthei√üen in the 18th century. Erbes-B√ºdesheim has experienced, like most Rhenish-Hessian villages, many hardships and much sorrow, but has also had some brighter and noteworthy times. In the Landshut War of Succession in 1504 and 1505, it was partly burnt down. In the time of the Thirty Years' War it was likely completely emptied of people. After this great war, many Reformed, but also some Catholic, foreigners were brought in from Switzerland, the Netherlands, Belgium and the Lower Rhine region under Charles I Louis, Elector Palatine‚Äôs population policies. = 19th to 20th century = Raised above the neighbouring villages as it was by its general location and special past, Erbes-B√ºdesheim was declared the seat of a subdivision of the Oberamt of Alzey. As for schooling, there was already in the 16th century an Evangelical teacher in the village, and beginning in the 18th century, there was also a Catholic one. While the 19th century saw only three teachers serve at the Evangelical school in 80 years, the Catholic school went through 21 different teachers in the same timespan. As of 1934, a Christian ‚Äúsimultaneous‚Äù school (that is, one shared by more than one denomination) replaced the two separate denominational schools that had existed until then. It was put into service under headteacher B√∂hler in 1954.  from 1950 onwards  The municipality of Erbes-B√ºdesheim, like many in Rhenish Hesse, has undergone a great shift since the 1950s not only in its structure but also in its outlook. If the municipality was still strongly characterized by agriculture after the Second World War until the 1960s, that is now rather outweighed by its residential character. Although in the 1950s there were still 50 or so independent agricultural businesses, there are now only three whose main business is agriculture and a few other businesses that have it as a sideline. Agriculture's hallmark, both before and after the two world wars, was the state-owned farm, the Staatsdom√§ne. By 1950, roughly 60 workers were still employed at this model operation, which was the model for many agricultural businesses, and whose way of working the local farmers adopted as their own. Seed breeding, swine and cattle raising, dairy farming and a distillery showed how multifaceted the Schlossgut, as it was popularly known locally, was. Ten teams of horses and two of oxen performed a considerable part of the fieldwork. The workers‚Äô hours were set at Mondays to Saturdays from 7:00 to 11:00 and from 13:00 to 19:00. One peculiarity even for that time was the way the workers met at the Catholic Church (Katzenpumpe) and then walked together to work. Skilled agricultural workers received not only their wages, but also, each year, a payment in kind, which was a whole range of farm goods such as 30 hundredweight of potatoes, five sacks of grain, two piglets, five hundredweight of straw, one are of clover and also a 40-German- mark bonus. The Staatsdom√§ne was run at the beginning of the 20th century first by Erwin R√∂mer, and after his death by his wife Nelly, and then until the end of the Second World War by Dr. Carl-Heinrich Roemer. Thereafter, Adolf Hartmann and, beginning in 1965 Joachim Hechler were the farm's leaseholders. For almost half a century ‚Äì from 1904 to 1950 ‚Äì Josef Huckle was the farm's governor. The state of Rhineland-Palatinate sold the Staatsdom√§ne in 1996, thereby ending the model agricultural operation's proud history. Both cropland and vineyards amounting to 47 ha were turned over. There was a great deal of work in this time for the chairman of the Teilnehmergemeinschaft (an association of landowners involved in a Flurbereinigung project) Ernst Hirschel and the surveyor Emma Huckle to perform. The longsighted decision was to plant 37 continuous kilometres of windbreaking hedgerows, which today shape not only the municipal area but also the microclimate. Because this set of hedgerows in Rhenish Hesse was so noteworthy, the project was featured at the 1992 Berlin International Gr√ºne Woche (‚ÄúGreen Week‚Äù). Another forward-looking decision in the course of Flurbereinigung was the building of a bypass road in 1960 and 1961. Ten ares of cropland were made available for this. In 1954, on Nacker Stra√üe (‚ÄúNack Road‚Äù) came the new school building's dedication, thereby solving the unsatisfactory situation that had seen various school locations in use. In this, Heinrich B√∂hler, who for more than 40 years played a leading r√¥le in shaping the school scene, was decisively involved. During Mayor Christian Wilhelm Lawall's time in office, Erbes-B√ºdesheim became one of the last municipalities in Rhenish Hesse to acquire a public water supply, in 1963, and also relatively late, in 1992, the municipality acquired a sewer system. Josef Seitner shaped the economic life in the municipality quite decisively. It was he who seized the moment after the Second World War and began producing pumice and hollow concrete blocks and dealing wholesale in building materials. After this, he turned to the then new industry of ready- mix concrete. Also showing his versatility was his success in plastics processing. His efforts brought many Erbes-B√ºdesheimers jobs near home. = Religion = Saint Michael's Church (Michaelskirche) in Erbes-B√ºdesheim suddenly became Saint Bartholomew's Church (Bartholom√§uskirche) in 1431. With the coming of the Protestant Reformation, which swept across almost the whole of Germany, the village became thoroughly Evangelical about 1559, first Lutheran and then beginning in 1598 Reformed. The church, rectory and school thereby belonged to the Evangelical parish. Only in the wake of the Thirty Years' War, in the time when new settlers were brought in, did Catholics once again come to the village, alongside other, Evangelical, settlers. The Roman Catholic parish was newly founded only in 1686 by Father Christoph Lautenbach. In the wake of the 1706 Palatine Church Sharing (Pf√§lzische Kirchenteilung, whereby Protestants had to share their churches with Catholics), the available church along with the rectory and school were transferred to the Catholic parish. Even so, the church was by this time in a wretched state, and a new Catholic church had to be built. This was done between 1736 and 1745 by the well known master builder Caspar Valerius. The Reformed parish held its services at the town hall from 1707 to 1734, until their new church was built under the Reverend Johann Christoph Steymann from Ensheim. Since the Evangelical clergyman could no longer live in Erbes-B√ºdesheim as of 1697, he moved to Ensheim and ministered to the Evangelical parish of Erbes-B√ºdesheim with Nack from Ensheim, building a strong ‚Äì and now almost forgotten ‚Äì relationship between Erbes-B√ºdesheim and Ensheim, at least in Evangelical ecclesiastical matters. Between 1701 and 1748 there was a small Mennonite community in Erbes-B√ºdesheim which held its services at the Wei√ües Schloss, a sign of the ecumenical, tolerant mindset of the Hugenot von Rochow (until 1729) or de la Roche (1729‚Äì1788) family, who owned the castle at the time, and who were Reformed. Moreover, Erbes-B√ºdesheim also had a small Jewish community, and might have as early as the 16th century. It had a small graveyard in the south part of the Blaues Schloss, and beginning in 1840 a new one in the village's northeast. Even a synagogue room was available on Niedergasse (lane).

Established in 2002, its head office was located at the CIS Tower, Miller Street, Manchester. It was mainly known through its two main subsidiaries: The Co-operative Bank (incorporating Smile, the first full internet bank in the UK) and The Co-operative Insurance. Co- operative Financial Services was formed as a holding company to bring these financial subsidiaries together under one umbrella society and to enable synergies between the businesses to be exploited. Following the Co-operative Bank's financial crisis in 2013, the group sold a majority of shares in the business, retaining a 20% stake. As a result, the group was reorganised, and the banking group structure was discontinued. History In 2007, the Group agreed to outsource its information systems to Xansa (now Sopra Steria). In 2008, Co-operative Financial Services was Business in the Community's Company of the Year, having been recognised at their Awards for Excellence gala dinner for making sustainable development a top priority in how it operates and in the products and services offered to its customers.

That month Moody's downgraded the bank's credit rating by six notches to junk status (Ba3) and the bank's Acting Chief Executive Barry Tootell resigned. The difficulties stem largely from the commercial loans of the Britannia Building Society, acquired in the 2009 merger. The group intended to sell its life insurance business to Royal London, releasing about ¬£200m in capital, and is planning to dispose of its other insurance business. Further financial restructuring will be required, and the option of the Bank of England taking over the ownership of the bank under the Banking Act 2009 has been considered. Former HSBC executive Niall Booker was appointed Chief Executive of The Co-operative Bank. On 5 June Richard Pennycook, former finance director of Morrisons, was named Co-operative Group's finance director, and Richard Pym, former chief executive of Alliance & Leicester, as chair of the Co-operative Banking Group and the Co-operative Bank.

In 1897, he formed the Tudhope Carriage Company in Orillia with his brothers. In 1902, with partner Harry Anderson, Tudhope established a company which manufactured agricultural implements.

At 7% of the German Weather Service‚Äôs weather stations, even lower figures are recorded. The driest month is January. The most rainfall comes in June. In that month, precipitation is twice what it is in January. Precipitation hardly varies over the year.

Some sculptural finds are on display at the Alzey Museum, such as a Vierg√∂tterstein (a ‚Äúfour-god stone‚Äù, a pedestal on which a Jupiter Column was customarily stood). There has also been a wealth of grave finds from Frankish times, especially a princely grave from the 7th century furnished with weapons. In 764, Flonheim had its first documentary mention as Flonenheim. In 960 Flonheim was mentioned as the seat of the Emichonen (later called the Counts of Flonheim). About 1133, Waldgrave Emich II endowed an Augustinian church canonical foundation (monastery), which was dissolved in 1554. About 1300, the village was fortified. Until the French Revolution (1792) Flonheim was the seat of a comital Amt.

After thinking about letters to be sent to Ceylon, they hear a noise coming from a mouse. Constantia thinks how sad it must be for the mouse with no crumbs around. The last time the sisters saw their father, Nurse Andrews was stationed by the bedside; the Colonel opened only one eye, glaring at his daughters before dying. Nurse Andrews, whom they invited to stay for a week after the Colonel died, is annoying them by overeating. Mr. Farolles, a clergyman who offers to arrange the funeral, visits and suggests they take Holy Communion, to feel better, but the sisters demur. Two mornings later, the daughters go to sort out their father's belongings. Josephine feels he would have been angry at the cost of the funeral. They consider sending their father's watch to their brother, Benny, but are concerned that there is no postal service there. They think of giving the watch to their nephew, Cyril. As they talk about the watch, they recall Cyril coming over for tea, and their conversation. Kate the maid asks boldly how the sisters want their fish cooked for dinner, for which they could not give a straight answer, so that Kate had to decide how the fish has to be cooked, which eventually leads them to decide about firing Kate. They wonder whether she snoops inside their dresser drawers. They hear a barrel organ and realize they need not stop it, because it no longer disturbs their father. They wonder how things would be, if their mother, who died in Ceylon, were still alive. They've never met men, except perhaps in Eastbourne. Finally, the sisters talk about their future, but cannot remember what they wanted to say. Characters *The late Colonel/Grandfather Pinner: The tyrannical father of Constantia and Josephine.

Geography  = Location = The municipality lies in Rhenish Hesse and is a winegrowing centre in the like-named wine region. It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Alzey-Land, whose seat is in Alzey. Freimersheim lies at the source of the Weidasserbach. Its agricultural origins can still be seen clearly, though it now also has many people who work in surrounding cities such as Alzey or Worms. Freimersheim has its own railway station with hourly trains towards Mainz and Frankfurt am Main as well as an Autobahn interchange on the A 63\\\\. There are also regular bus links to Alzey.  History  In 763, Freimersheim had its first documentary mention in a document from Lorsch Abbey, and through most of its history was an abbey possession. The name comes from Frim√¢r, and means ‚ÄúFrim√¢r‚Äôs (and his kin‚Äôs) settlement‚Äù. Belonging to the Amt of Alzey, Freimersheim was under Electoral Palatinate‚Äôs ownership from the High Middle Ages until the French Revolution.

At the end of the 18th century, it was called Freimersheim hinter der Warte (‚Äúbehind the Warte‚Äù, a mountain), to distinguish it from Framersheim.Zur Geschichte von Freimersheim (History of Freimersheim) (from the regionalgeschichte.net website, project of the University of Mainz, in German) After the Second World War, many ethnic Germans driven out of Germany‚Äôs former eastern territories, foremost among these, Silesians, came to settle in this rural idyll, many of whom have stayed until today and still often work regularly as harvest helpers.

History  In the Middle Ages, Gabsheim was called Geispisheim (Geispitzheim); among many other spellings found in documents are also Geispodisheim (Geisbodesheim) (1250) and Gespesheim (1484). All forms, however, go back etymologically to the placename G√§u-Spie√üheim. Over time, the pronunciation of Gespesheim shifted to Gabsheim. Since the village is overwhelmingly Catholic, it is also sometimes known in the local speech as Gottes Gahbsem (the first word meaning ‚ÄúGod‚Äôs‚Äù). The ‚Äúfortified place in Geisbodesheim near the church‚Äù mentioned in 1250 gives clues to a permanent living place or perhaps a small castle, which would have been the von Geispitzheim noble family's ancestral seat. As vassals of the Feudal Lords of Bolanden, further becoming fiefholders of the Counts of Veldenz beginning in the 14th century, the Knights of Geispitzheim (also called the Knights of Geisbodesheim) were mentioned as the Burgmannen at Odernheim am Glan (1190), at the Moschellandsburg (castle) near Obermoschel (1377, 1421, 1431), at Burg Treuenfels (castle) near Altenbamberg (1392), at Armsheim (14th century) and in neighbouring Bechtolsheim (until the early 16th century). The inscriptions from nine preserved gravestones from the 14th and 15th centuries clearly document that the Knights of Geispolzheim had their family burial ground near Saint Alban's Church, not far from their Gabsheim ancestral seat. Noteworthy, besides those things bearing witness to the Gothic epoch, is the masterfully crafted Baroque stone statue of Saint Alban.  Politics  = Municipal council = The council is made up of 12 council members, who were elected at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman. The municipal election held on 7 June 2009 yielded the following results:Kommunalwahl Rheinland-Pfalz 2009, Gemeinderat { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" width=\\"350\\" - bgcolor=\\"#eeeeee\\" align=\\"center\\"   SPD  CDU  FWG  Total - align=\\"center\\"  2009  1  8  3  12 seats - align=\\"center\\"  2004  1  7  4  12 seats } = Mayor = Christian Geier (CDU), a native Gabsheimer, was elected mayor in May 2014. He is a dually-licensed attorney, licensed to practice law in Germany and in the State of Michigan. Geier is a graduate of the Johannes Gutenberg University and also earned a Master of Laws in Labor and Employment Law at Wayne State University Law School in Detroit, Michigan. Committed to serving the people of Gabsheim, he is also a longtime member of the Gabsheim volunteer fire department. = Coat of arms = The German blazon reads: Von Silber und Rot geteilt, oben drei blaue Lilien nebeneinander, unten ein liegendes silbernes Spatenblatt. In English heraldic language, the municipality's arms might be described thus: Per fess argent three fleurs-de- lis in fess azure and gules a spade blade fesswise sinister of the first. Gabsheim's arms as displayed and described herein go back to a court seal that was being used as early as 1507. While the spade blade is believed to have been a municipal symbol, the lilies refer to the Chamberlains of Dalberg, who were the lords until the late 18th century. The field tinctures argent and gules (silver and red) are an historical link to the former Archbishopric of Mainz, to which ‚Äì like all Rhenish-Hessian places ‚Äì Gabsheim also belonged.  Culture and sightseeing = Buildings = The Catholic parish church in Gabsheim is among Rhenish Hesse‚Äôs oldest and biggest churches and given its commanding location above the village it is a prominent landmark for the whole area. The early mediaeval church was acknowledged in 1164 by Pope Lucius III as a holding of St. Alban's Abbey, Mainz. Even today, the church is still consecrated to Saint Alban of Mainz. The forerunner building, mentioned in 1164, gave way towards the late 15th century to a newer, bigger building in the Gothic style. The new church‚Äôs nave and tower must have been built at roughly the same time as the church in Bechtolsheim for both churches bear the same mason‚Äôs hallmark, ‚Äú-L‚Äù. In Gabsheim, this can be seen chiselled on both the bell tower's doorframe and on the church portal (as confirmed by an entry in the Speyer state archive, the church in Bechtolsheim was built between 1482 and 1487). Historically and stylistically, the church would seem to be the work of a member of the ‚ÄúMeisenheim School‚Äù, but whether the designer actually was Philipp von Gm√ºnd cannot be established.Liebfrauenland: Kulturf√ºhrer Gotik in Rheinhessen A new expansion of the Gabsheim parish church was dedicated in 1768. Nevertheless, the whole building, including the tower, retained its Gothic character. This is shown on the outside foremost by the mighty chancel with its buttresses. Inside, the chancel likewise forms the architectural highlight with its fine rib vaults adorned with coats of arms. From the Gothic era come many of the d√©cor's important pictorial works, while on the church's outer walls, various gravestones of the noble families that held estates here, such as the Barons of Dalberg and the knightly family Bube von Geispitzheim or Fetzer von Geispitzheim can be seen.

Daly detectors are typically used in mass spectrometers. Principle of operation Ions that hit the doorknob release secondary electrons. A high voltage (about ) between the doorknob and the scintillator accelerates the electrons onto the phosphor screen, where they are converted to photons. These photons are detected by the photomultiplier. The advantage of the Daly detector is that the photomultiplier can be separated by a window, which lets the photons through from the high vacuum of the mass spectrometer, thus preventing an otherwise possible contamination and extending life span of the detector. The Daly detector also allows a higher acceleration after the field-free region of a time-of-flight mass spectrometer flight tube, which can improve the sensitivity for heavy ions.

In typography, a column is one or more vertical blocks of content positioned on a page, separated by gutters (vertical whitespace) or rules (thin lines, in this case vertical). Columns are most commonly used to break up large bodies of text that cannot fit in a single block of text on a page. Additionally, columns are used to improve page composition and readability. Newspapers very frequently use complex multi-column layouts to break up different stories and longer bodies of texts within a story. Column can also more generally refer to the vertical delineations created by a typographic grid system which type and image may be positioned. In page layout, the whitespace on the outside of the page (bounding the first and last columns) are known as margins; the gap between two facing pages is also considered a gutter, since there are columns on both sides. (Any gutter can also be referred to as a margin, but exterior and horizontal margins are not gutters.)http://www.wisegeek.com/in-typography- what-are-gutters.htm Typographic style Column width is traditionally called measure by typesetters. For best legibility, typographic manuals suggest that columns should be wide enough to contain roughly 60 characters per line.Carter, 1993. p. 91 One formula suggests multiplying the point size of the font by 2 to reach how wide a column should be in picasFor example, a 9pt font size would require an 18 pica column width. ‚Äî in effect a column width of 24 ems. Following these guidelines usually results in multiple narrow columns being favored over a single wide column.Romano, 1984. pp. 86‚Äì87 Historically, books containing predominantly text generally have around 40 lines per column. However, this rule of thumb does not apply to more complex text that contain multiple images or illustrations, footnotes, running heads, folios, and captions.Haslam, 2005. p. 140 Column contrast refers to the overall color or greyness established by the column, and can be adjusted in a number of ways. One way is to adjust the relationship between the width and height of the column. Another way is to make adjustments to the typeface, from choosing a specific font, to adjusting weight, style, size and leading. Column contrast can be used to establish hierarchy, to balance the page composition, and to visually activate areas of the page.Carter, 1993. p. 51 Web layout In web design, columns are often used to separate primary content from secondary and tertiary content. For example, a common two column layout may include a left column with navigation links, and a right column for body text. One method of creating columns for the web is to place text within an HTML table element, often with the border set to zero. However, this method is considered outdated and inaccessible to some. Another method includes using CSS to either float or position the corresponding text. These methods were not as straightforward as using HTML tables, which made a tableless three column layout a sort of holy grail once these techniques were discovered in the early 2000s.‚ÄúCSS Layout Techniques: for Fun and Profit‚Äù glish.com Accessed 2007-12-12.

Geography  = Location = The municipality lies in Rhenish Hesse between Worms and Mainz. It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Eich, whose seat is in the like-named municipality. = Neighbouring municipalities = Gimbsheim borders in the north on the municipality of Guntersblum, in the west on the municipality of Alsheim and in the south on the municipality of Eich. In the east, the municipality of Gimbsheim is bordered by the Rhine.  History  Gimbsheim is believed to have been founded about 500 while the Franks were settling the land under Clovis I by a Frank named Gimmund. In the beginning, the place was called Gimmundheim. Over the course of the years, the name changed in historical sources, yielding the current name Gimbsheim from Gimmundheim. On 13 May 766, Gimbsheim, then called Gimmenheim, had its first documentary mention in the Lorsch codex. Two of the villagers donated cropland and vineyards to Lorsch Abbey for their salvation. In 813, another donation, this one to Fulda Abbey, was registered. From 1194 comes the first documentary mention of a church in Gimbsheim. In 1208, a Gimbsheim clergyman by the name of Heinrich was mentioned as being a member of the Cathedral Chapter at Worms. In 1402, the Gimbsheim court seal, the Mauricius Siegel was mentioned for the first time. In 1499, Gimbsheim burnt to the ground. In 1662, Gimbsheim became an Electoral Palatinate holding. Only four years later, in 1666, Gimbsheim was stricken with the Plague. On 17 October 1704, another great fire in Gimbsheim destroyed a great many homesteads. Beginning in 1798, all important municipal business was handled through the town hall, not, as it heretofore had been, through the parish register. In 1800 came the first mention of a doctor in Gimbsheim. Between 1798 and 1814, Gimbsheim was in the Department of Mont- Tonnerre (or Donnersberg in German), belonging at that time to Napoleonic France. In 1830, the Rhine straightening project was carried out along the reach of the river that borders Gimbsheim. The project would eventually encompass the Rhine's course from Basel all the way down to Worms. In 1974, Gimbsheim opened its outdoor swimming pool. In 1977, the areas left high and dry by the Rhine straightening project in 1830, known as the Altrhein (‚ÄúOld Rhine‚Äù), were made a conservation area. In 1997, the television series Himmelsheim was filmed in Gimbsheim for S√ºdwestrundfunk. The same year, the Niederrheinhalle (‚ÄúLower Rhine Hall‚Äù) came to be as a centre for sport and culture. In 2000, the so-called Pfarrwiesensee, a former gravel quarry that had become a pond, was converted into a bathing lake.  Religion  = The Jewish community = From the latter half of the 19th century until 1933, Gimbsheim was home to a small Jewish community. The Jewish population peaked around the years 1900 and 1905 when there were 72 Jews in the municipality (3% of the total population). On 27 August 1892, a synagogue was dedicated. After 1933, it was sold and converted into a house, which still stands now. At least eight of Gimbsheim's Jews lost their lives after the deportations in National Socialist times.  Politics  = Municipal council = The council is made up of 20 council members, who were elected by proportional representation at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.

The grain has been blazoned here as rye because ParkerJames Parker‚Äôs description of grains as they are used in heraldry identifies rye as being ‚Äúdistinguished from other grain by representing the ear drooping‚Äù. Heraldry of the World, on the other hand, identifies the grain as wheat, which along with the grapes appears in the arms to represent the municipality's two main crops. The charges in the chief, though, seem to be all that there is in the arms that can be directly linked with Gimbsheim. Although the cramp, usually identified in German blazon as a Wolfsangel, was already appearing as a municipal heraldic charge in the 18th century, its origin is unknown. Earlier municipal seals had shown Saint Maurice. Furthermore, another proposal for municipal arms in 1958, the year when the current arms were adopted, was quite a different design which might be blazoned thus: Argent a cross gules, in dexter chief a roundel Or surmounted by a Moor's head proper. This would have shown a silver shield covered by a red cross, and in the silver space left in the upper dexter (armsbearer's right, viewer's left), a gold circle overlaid with a Black man's head, representing Saint Maurice (who was himself Black).Description and explanation of Gimbsheim‚Äôs arms = Town partnerships = * Talant, C√¥te-d'Or, France  Culture and sightseeing = Regular events = For more than 30 years now, Gimbsheim has had a further representative besides its mayor, namely a young and most pretty lady, the Kerweprinzessin (kermis princess). Originally a representative of the Gimbsheim church's consecration, this ecclesiastical custom later grew into the kermis (church consecration festival, locally known as the Kerb or Kerwe). Each kermis princess holds the title for a year, during which she represents her home municipality in other regions.

It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Wonnegau, whose seat is in Osthofen. = Constituent communities = Gundersheim has an outlying centre called Enzheim, which was once a separate municipality.  History  In 769, Gundersheim had its first documentary mention in a donation document from Lorsch Abbey (Codex Laureshamensis Nr. 920). Even the Wei√üenburg Monastery in Alsace owned a lordly estate in the municipality in the 9th century, of which there is documentary proof. In the late 10th century, the Wei√üenburg holding became Salian property, and then a Staufer holding. From the High Middle Ages, the ownership passed from one noble family to another at a quicker pace. Among others, the Raugraves, Waldgraves and Rhinegraves, the Palatine Electors, the Dukes of Nassau and the Counts of Sponheim each had a share in the municipality. In 1475, Gundersheim became a wholly Electoral Palatinate holding, governed as part of the Oberamt of Alzey. With the French occupation of the Palatinate on the Rhine‚Äôs left bank in 1797, the municipality became part of the Department of Mont-Tonnerre (or Donnersberg in German). After the Congress of Vienna, it belonged to the Grand Duchy of Hesse, and as of 1918 it was part of the People's State of Hesse. In 1946, it passed along with the former Hessian province of Rhenish Hesse (Rheinhessen) to the newly formed state of Rhineland-Palatinate. = Religion = Gundersheim has at its disposal an Evangelical church and a Catholic church. The Reformation was established by Frederick II, Elector Palatine in 1546. The greater part of the population is overwhelmingly Evangelical.

Since 1920, there has also been the Verein f√ºr Leibes√ºbungen (VfL) Gundersheim (‚ÄúClub for bodily exercise‚Äù), which currently has about 430 members, and departments for football, table tennis and gymnastics. = Regular events = *At Corpus Christi, the local volunteer fire brigade and its associated promotional club have a one-day open house. *During the summer, several winemakers take turns opening their wineries for visitors to come and look, and taste the wines. *Each year on the last weekend in August, the Rotweinkerwe (‚ÄúRed Wine Fair‚Äù) is held.  Economy and infrastructure  = Transport = Gundersheim lies on the Autobahn A 61 and has at its disposal its own interchange southeast of the Alzey Autobahn cross, through which the A 63 can also be reached. It also has its own railway station on the Worms‚ÄìBingen Stadt railway with half-hourly trains to either Alzey or Worms. At the sporting ground is one of the municipality's two bus stops. = Economy = The municipality has been characterized by winegrowing over the ages. Even today there are a few wineries. In the latter half of the 19th century there were two match factories, although these both went out of business about 1890. Of greater importance was the limestone quarry, which until 1955 was run as the Gundersheimer Kalkwerke by S√ºdzucker AG in Offstein, and until then was the biggest employer in the municipality. As well, there is a commercial development with various businesses in, among other things, logistics, services and production. = Public institutions =  Freiwillige Feuerwehr Gundersheim  The volunteer fire brigade currently has at its disposal more than 32 active and 10 youth members. The active department practises every fortnight with the four available firefighting vehicles (LF 8/6, STW 1000, TSF, HVO-PKW). Moreover, there is here, as there is throughout almost all of Germany, a readiness on the brigade's part to be called to duty at any time. That is to say, the brigade's active members carry a pager which is triggered in an emergency, bringing all available firefighters ‚Äì a number that can be reduced by commuters or by employers who will not comply ‚Äì to the fire station to be ready to move out. Furthermore, the Gundersheim volunteer fire brigade also has at its disposal a Helfer vor Ort group, a team of certified first responders who also spring into action through pager alerts to deal with medical emergencies in their emergency medical vehicles, which they get from the German Red Cross‚Äôs Alzey district chapter. These certified first responders currently number 16 ‚Äì 15 men and 1 woman ‚Äì and also form part of the Schnelleinsatzgruppe (SEG ‚Äì ‚ÄúFast Deployment Group‚Äù) with the German Red Cross's Alzey district chapter, along with which the Helfer vor Ort are called to duty and health service. = Education =  Kindergarten  There is one kindergarten, which owing to recent increased interest has been expanded.

Initially published weekly and priced at one penny, its themes included votes for women, women's education, and radical attitudes towards vivisection, dress reform, women's control of their sexuality, child care, and vegetarianism. History The first issue of Shafts was published in November 1892. It was founded and edited by Margaret Sibthorp and was initially funded by an anonymous friend. By June 1893, however, Sibthorp had begun to appeal to readers for financial support. Owing to a lack of funds Shafts became a monthly publication in 1893, having initially been published weekly. Sibthorp was forced to downsize the magazine's London offices near the Strand‚Äîwhich had once been the location for women's classes, lecture courses and meetings‚Äîto a single room, before relocating to her home in suburban West Hampstead in 1895. In 1898 the frequency of publication was slowed from monthly to bi-monthly, and in 1899, following an announcement that it would henceforth become quarterly, Shafts ceased publication altogether. The magazine's decline has been attributed to Sibthorp's refusal to follow the emerging New Journalism' formula of information, gossip and entertainment\\", which led to Shafts' loss of readers to competing publications. Shafts was sold for one penny and was targeted towards lower-middle class women. Most of the magazine's correspondents and contributing writers‚Äîwith Sibthorp as a notable exception‚Äîwere published under pseudonyms. Content Its themes included votes for women, women's education, and \\"radical\\" attitudes towards vivisection, dress reform, women's control of their sexuality, child care, and vegetarianism. It published literary criticism, including works about Shakespearean characters, feminist poetry, and book recommendations for young women. Sibthorp was a member of the Theosophical Society, which was reflected in Shafts extensive coverage of occult and psychical topics. As noted by Claudia Nelson in her book Invisible Men, Shafts \\"offered little factual reportage\\" and instead largely consisted of opinion pieces, correspondence columns, short stories and poetry. In an August 1893 editorial, Sibthorp stated that Shafts purpose was to promote knowledge amongst women: \\"that women must first know all things, ere they can judge of an evil, or any proposed remedy for an evil\\". Articles and editorials encouraged women to pursue \\"an education that might emancipate them from patriarchal assumptions\\". Kate Flint notes in her book The Woman Reader, 1837‚Äì1914, that Shafts was one of few feminist periodicals at the time that promoted the furthering of women's rights through education in traditionally male-oriented domains, rather than through protection and control. The cover of Shafts depicted a woman with a bow shooting an arrow (\\"shaft\\") labelled \\"wisdom\\", \\"truth\\" and \\"justice\\".

Geography  = Location = The municipality lies in Rhenish Hesse and belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Eich, whose seat is in the like-named municipality. The municipality's special charm finds its roots in its location right on the Rhine, or rather on a sidestream called the Schadegrawe, which is cut off from the Rhine's mainstream by an island, the W√∂rth (this word is a local variant of the German word Werder, which often means, as in this case, an island in a river; its English equivalent might be ‚Äúait‚Äù or ‚Äúholm‚Äù). The name ‚ÄúSchadegrawe‚Äù is a dialectal pronunciation of the Standard High German ‚ÄúScheidegraben‚Äù (‚ÄúParting Dyke‚Äù) between Hamm's and Ibersheim's municipal areas. Within the Verbandsgemeinde of Eich, Hamm am Rhein has the longest stretch of the Rhine within its limits. = Neighbouring municipalities = On the Rhineland- Palatinate side, Hamm neighbours the municipality of Eich and Ibersheim, a suburb of the city of Worms. On the Hessian side lies the town of Gernsheim, to which Hamm is linked by ferry.  History  In 782, Hamm had its first documentary mention in the Lorsch codex.

Strollers, hikers and nature lovers find here easy access to a network of various paths. = Music = The Hamm am Rhein singer-songwriter Markus Schmittel, also known as Korbmachersoldat (‚ÄúBasket Maker Soldier‚Äù) is always writing and singing songs about his home, which has made him widely known beyond the municipality's limits. = Natural monuments = Hamm's main landmark is an oaktree, which enjoys conservation status, that stands across from the town hall. This tree was planted on Easter Monday 1872 after the end of the Franco-Prussian War as a token of peace. = Sport = The indoor-sport departments of the local sport club, SV Rheingold 08 Hamm e.V., such as table tennis and gymnastics, can be found at the municipal hall, making this hall not only a convenient exercise centre for the community but also a venue for many events. Another attraction is the 18-hole golf course opened in mid October 2000 by the Golfclub Worms at the Hamm-Gernsheim ferry on the former Seibert estate (Seibert'scher Gutshof). At the moment, nine holes can be played, but the rest will soon be opened. Its location in the Rhine floodplain landscape is outstanding. = Regular events = Each year at the so-called Twelve Apostles, right on the Rhine, an open-air event is held at which followers of various musical genres from near and far meet. Also every year, the Eichbaumfest (‚ÄúOaktree Festival‚Äù) around the Hamm Oak. Moreover, Hamm am Rhein is a regular stop on the outing that makes up part of the yearly ‚Äúmotorcycle blessing‚Äù in Eich. A highlight for the villagers each year is the Maibaumfest ‚Äì ‚ÄúMay Tree Festival‚Äù ‚Äì staged by the local volunteer fire brigade, at which a tree is festively decorated and put up next to the Hamm Oak across from the town hall. On New Year's Day, people meet in ice-cold weather to go skating on the Schadegrawe.  Economy and infrastructure  In the early 20th century, basket making formed the population's main source of income. Spurred by the Old Rhine ‚Äì the former Rhine channel from which the river's flow was diverted when it was straightened about 1830 ‚Äì with its abundant willows, the village grew into a widely known handicraft centre.

Even so, the municipality nevertheless has a wealth of water, which might account for the choice of the new name: the placename ending ‚Äîborn is a form of the German word Brunnen, which can mean \\"spring\\", \\"fountain\\" or \\"well\\". The word hoch means \\"high\\". = Climate = Yearly precipitation in Hochborn amounts to 541 mm, which is very low, falling into the lowest tenth of the precipitation chart for all Germany. Only at 9% of the German Weather Service‚Äôs weather stations are even lower figures recorded. The driest month is February. The most rainfall comes in July. In that month, precipitation is 1.9 times what it is in February. Precipitation varies moderately. At 34% of the weather stations, lower seasonal swings are recorded.  History  In 782, Hochborn had its first documentary mention when Theo and Anthilde von Blatmarsheim (the last word being the village's original name) donated 15 Morgen of cropland and a meadow to Lorsch Abbey on 23 April that year. They further made over other holdings of theirs in Blatmarsheim to the Abbey, as described on 9 October 788. It is believed that the village's original name might have derived from the kin of a Frankish settler named Blatmar or Blitter.Hochborn‚Äôs history Over the last 1,200 years, the municipality's name has changed several times. The last name change came on 1 March 1971 when the old name Bl√∂desheim was dropped in favour of Hochborn.Die verschiedenen Ortsnamen im Wandel der ZeitStatistisches Landesamt Rheinland-Pfalz - Amtliches Gemeindeverzeichnis 2006 The change was approved by local voters with a margin of 96%. The old name had not only led to annoyance and teasing, but had also been hindering wine sales.Note about the name change on Hochborn‚Äôs website The names borne by the village over the ages are:Hochborn‚Äôs history *782: Blatmarsheim *788: Blatmarisheim *789: Blittersheim *1070: Blettenesheim *1261: Bleidinsheim *1341: Bledinsheim *1348: Bledensheim *1427: Pl√∂desheim *1497: Bledesheim *1602: Bl√∂de√üheim *1613: Bl√∂desheim *1971: Hochborn Not much else is known about Hochborn's history, likely because it was not only a very small place in days gone by, but also a very poor one.

It opened in 1829, and a short tramway connected it to the Plymouth and Dartmoor Railway at Crabtree Junction. It had been replaced by a tramway within ten years, but continued to be used as a mill leat to supply Marsh Mills corn mill, and most of it is still visible. History In 1778, the Cann Slate Quarry was owned by John Parker, and in order to make transport of the slate easier, he asked the engineer John Smeaton to survey a canal, to run from the quarry to the bridge at Marsh Mills. The River Plym between the bridge and Plymouth was navigable by barges. Although Smeaton carried out the work, he concluded that the canal, which would be long and would need several locks to accommodate the drop of in level, was unlikely to be economic, since the only trade would be the output from the quarry. He therefore suggested that a tramway would be a better solution, and could be built for about half the cost of the canal. Parker did not proceed with either option. In 1819, an Act of Parliament was obtained which authorised the construction of a horse tramway between Princetown and Plymouth. In 1821, the directors of the Plymouth and Dartmoor horse tramway applied for a second Act, to authorise a deviation to the route, and in order to obtain consent for the new route from Parker's son, also called John Parker and Earl of Morley since 1815, they agreed to build a branch, possibly including an inclined plane, to the quarry. The company ran into financial difficulties, and the branch was not built. Despite the fact that he was a member of the management committee for the tramway, Parker took legal action against the three directors who had proposed the branch. They suggested that he should build the branch himself, and in return, all goods transferring from it to the existing tramway would be subject to lower tolls. Parker proceeded to build a tub-boat canal from the quarry to Marsh Mills. It was about wide, and stopped above the bridge. He then wrote to the tramway company, suggesting that he was undecided whether to complete the canal by tunnelling under the turnpike road to connect it to the river, or to link it to their tramway at Crabtree by building a private branch. The letter resulted in an agreement on tolls, and the private tramway was built to complete the link. The canal was a little under long, and the tramway was about long. It crossed the river on a cast iron bridge with two arches. The canal was opened on 20 November 1829. Some time after 1834 and before 1839, Earl Morley's tramway was extended up the valley to Cann Quarry. Near the quarry, it was built on the canal bank, but lower down it was built further to the west. Once it was opened, the canal ceased to be used as a navigation and served as a mill leat for the corn mill at Marsh Mills. A branch of the tramway, which was built to the unusual gauge of , was constructed from Plym Bridge to the quarries at Lee Moor, and the whole railway became known as the Lee Moor Tramway. The South Devon and Tavistock Railway built a branch up the Plym Valley, which was completed in 1854. For most of its route between Marsh Mills and the quarry, it was built between Earl Morley's tramway and the canal. The new railway cut across the quarry, which closed the following year.Ordnance Survey, 1:2500 and 1:10560 maps, 1907 Marsh Mills corn mill continued to operate until 1927, when the owners became bankrupt. Route Crabtree Junction, where Earl Morley's Tramway joined the Plymouth and Dartmouth Railway, has disappeared, covered by a motel and the interchange between the A38 road and the A374 road, although the two-arched cast iron bridge over the River Plym remains. The tramway towards the quarry has become a cycleway and long-distance footpath, known as the West Devon Way, while most of the canal is still visible, and is often filled with water after rainfall, although the final section at Marsh Mills is not visible. The South Devon and Tavistock Railway branch was abandoned, but the lower end is now part of the Plym Valley Railway. The current Marsh Mills Station is a little further to the north than the original one, as a mineral line which serves a china clay works still passes through the old site. The Plym Valley Railway is being extended to Plym Bridge, where the Lee Moor incline branched off. The railway crosses the route of the canal in two places on this section, and both of the bridges have been rebuilt as part of the restoration. Beyond Plym Bridge, the cycleway leaves Earl Morley's tramway and follows the South Devon and Tavistock Railway instead, allowing it to cross the River Plym just beyond Cann Quarry, and continue on to Yelverton.Ordnance Survey, 1:25,000 map Points of interest See also *Canals of the United Kingdom *History of the British canal system Bibliography * =References= External links *Cann Quarry about a hundred and eighty years ago Category:Canals in Devon Category:Canals opened in 1829 Category:Industrial archaeological sites in Devon ","title":"Cann Quarry Canal"},{"id":"11787863","text":"Mauchenheim is an Ortsgemeinde ‚Äì a municipality belonging to a Verbandsgemeinde, a kind of collective municipality ‚Äì in the Alzey-Worms district in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany.

The miners are so named because the green bowls they use for panning, when carried on their backs, are said to resemble the shells of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.Channel 4 UK TV program \\"Unreported World\\", 7.30 to 8.00 pm, Friday 15 June 2007 Many ninja miners are Mongolians who lost their jobs after the fall of the People's Republic of Mongolia and became traditional herders. In 2001 and 2002 Mongolia faced two harsh winters (known as dzuds), and a third of the country's livestock was lost. Thousands of families took up ninja mining, and searched for quartz or gold on properties large mining companies deemed unmineable. The ninja mining process starts by a group of miners (up to four) digging a hole usually deep using iron stakes, or until reaching a depth with a high gold content. Holes that are near to each other are connected underground. Upon completion of the hole one ninja miner works at the bottom of the hole by candlelight, digging up dirt, while another pulls dirt to the surface to be sifted by yet another ninja miner. In 2003 there were approximately 30,000 ninja miners in Mongolia, which increased to 100,000 in 2007. Ninja miners earned an average of $10 a week in 2003, which increased to $5-10 per day in 2007. Students on summer break often work with their parents to help pay tuition. The largest ninja mining area is at Zaamar, a five-hour drive from Ulan Bator. Ninja Mining is having an adverse effect on agriculture, as nomadic herders are having to move more frequently to find land for their livestock to graze on due to the increase in holes and the reduced amount of grass. This combined with the northward expansion of the Gobi Desert is causing some herders to reduce their herd to focus on higher quality livestock, while others are giving up nomadism and moving setting up farms and cooperatives. Peter Morrow, the CEO of Khan Bank (the former state agricultural bank) said this could be the end of traditional herding in Mongolia, \\"the last horse-based nomadic culture in the world\\". An episode of the Animal Planet series River Monsters filmed in Mongolia mentioned ninja miners; a local guide mentioning that ninjas will aggressively defend their claims from intruders.

Karnataka stands first among all the states of India in terms of revenue generated from software exports. Software exports from Karnataka amounted to excess of US$ 30.41 billion in 2017-18 (up to September 2017). This achievement has earned Karnataka's capital city Bangalore the sobriquet of Silicon Valley of India. This is because of the presence of major software companies in Bangalore and the revenue generated by exports of computer software. Though most software companies are located in Bangalore, some have settled in other cities like Mysore, Mangalore, Belgaum and Hubli in Karnataka. The Nandi Hills area in Devanahalli outskirts is the site of the upcoming $22 Billion, BIAL IT Investment Region, one of the largest infrastructure projects in the history of Karnataka. This endeavor expected to create four million jobs over by the year 2030. The infrastructure required for setting up software industries in Karnataka is provided by STPI. The software industry in Karnataka includes companies dealing with various fields like telecommunication, banking software, avionics, database, automotive, networking, semiconductors, mobile handsets, internet applications and business process outsourcing.  Origin  Starting in the 1980s, Karnataka emerged as the information technology capital of the country. A total of 1973 companies in Karnataka are involved in Information Technology related business including big firms like Infosys and Wipro who have their headquarters in Bangalore. The origin of the growth of the software industry in Karnataka seems to have been the entry of Texas Instruments which was the first multinational to set up base in Sona Tower, Millers Road, Bangalore in 1985.Texas Instruments was searching for a location to set up their overseas development centre in India in the early 1980s. They first looked at the states of Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu but when both states refused permission, Karnataka was approached with a condition that land allotted must be near an airport. The then chief minister of Karnataka Gundu Rao agreed to their terms and granted land near the HAL Airport in Bangalore. Texas Instruments currently has a big facility in Bagmane Tech Park in Bangalore near the airport. There were many factors conducive to the development of the software industry in Karnataka state. One factor is the presence of large numbers of top grade science and engineering institutions like IISc, NITK, B.M.S. College of Engineering, BVB, Malnad College of Engineering MSRIT, NIE, SJCE, RVCE, PESIT, SDMCET and around 200 engineering colleges. The software industry requires large numbers of skilled engineers which are regularly churned out of the engineering colleges in Karnataka. The presence of Public sector undertakings like BEL, HAL, BHEL, ITI and BEML gave ready access to manpower as well as trial opportunities of newly developed software. There were many advanced laboratories like NAL and ISRO in and around Bangalore which provided necessary basic knowledge required for software development. The successive state governments have been proactive in providing necessary facilities for growth of the industry. The salubrious climate of Bangalore also helps in the growth of the software industry there.  Effects  There has been both positive and negative effects of software industry's tremendous growth. The per capita income of state has risen. The software engineers of the current generation earn salaries at the beginning of their career more than what their parents used to earn at the end of their career. This affluence can be seen with young engineers flaunting new electronic gadgets. Cars once considered a luxury has become a commodity, often leading to traffic jams and unavailability of space for parking. More people are traveling abroad for work as well as for tourism. Growth in income has had an effect on the real estate prices with the land rates skyrocketing. Land prices have shot much beyond rate of inflation and in some places rate of land doubles every two years. Agriculture has slowed down as people find it more lucrative to sell the land rather than use it for agriculture. The surge in income of software professionals has led to increased interest among youth opting for computer science and information technology courses in college. The basic science, arts and commerce fields have felt a shortage of quality manpower. The current global recession of economy has hit software industry with some losing their jobs.

Generally, the student was supposed to pass the symbole onto another of his fellow students after catching him speaking Breton, Occitan or Catalan (referred to as patois).

Nature of the object The symbole could be: * an ordinary wooden clog, sometimes not hollowed out, worn around the neck * a slate worn around the neck. At the Plouaret public school from 1943 to 1949 students were required to write \\"je parle breton\\" (\\"I speak Breton\\") on the slate. * an object to be carried in the pocket, such as a button, toy sabot, or badge.

After medical training locally and in Dublin he moved to London to join the Homoeopathic Hospital, and then almost immediately returned to Ireland to help victims of the Great Famine. Returning to London he left the Homeopathic Hospital, stopped prescribing homeopathic treatments, and established successful practices in Blackheath and the City of London. In 1850 he married Sophia McKern, a childhood friend, with whom he had eight children, including Percy Marmaduke Kidd, the eldest. Sophia died in 1872, and in 1875 Kidd married Frances Octavia Rouse, with whom he had another seven children.

In Roman times there was a rural Roman settlement in the form of a Roman farmstead ‚Äì a villa rustica ‚Äì with cropraising, livestock raising and winegrowing. In 406, the Franks crossed the Rhine frontier and settled the area between the Donnersberg and the Rhine. New placenames with the ending ‚Äîheim (cognate with English home) were overwhelmingly the Franks‚Äô favourite choice. King Clovis had himself christened in 498, and the Franks became Christian. In the time that followed, it is believed that Vendersheim also arose as a Frankish-Christian settlement. The placename Fendersheim first crops up only in a document in 1426 (Staatsarchiv Koblenz). It was drawn up by Father Pleban at Saint Martin's Church (St. Martinuskirche) in Fendersheim. In 1443, the name was written as Vender√üheim in Hessian documents. The name means ‚Äúthe fendiheri‚Äôs home‚Äù, fendiheri meaning a Frankish commander. It is worth pointing out that the letter V is generally pronounced the same way as F in German. In the 15th century, Vendersheim belonged to the territory of the Junkers Faust zu Stromberg. Through the Reformation in the Electorate of the Palatinate, Vendersheim became a Lutheran parish in 1556, and Saint Martin's became a Lutheran church. The 1648 Peace of Westphalia contained certain stipulations for the Electorate of the Palatinate dealing with simultanea. Vendersheim was among the places that became simultanea, that is, Catholic, Lutheran and Reformed citizens were and would remain entitled to their right of abode. Junker Faust became Catholic in 1660 and the church's estate in Vendersheim passed to the Catholic Church. The family von Faust died out in 1730 and Vendersheim passed to the House of the Counts at Eltz (Grafen zu Eltz). Saint Martin's Church became a simultaneous church. Lutherans and Catholics used the same church building. In 1790 and 1791, with the Count's help, the Catholic parish built the new Saint Martin's Church (distinguished in German by being called Martinskirche instead of St. Martinuskirche), while the Evangelical parish kept using the old church. During the occupation by French troops from 1792 to 1814, Vendersheim belonged to the Department of Mont-Tonnerre (or Donnersberg in German). Feudal rights were abolished and for births, marriages and deaths, only state certification was valid. State schools were also instituted. After the 1815 Congress of Vienna, the Worms, Alzey, Mainz and Bingen region were annexed as the Province of Rhenish Hesse (Rheinhessen) to the Grand Duchy of Hesse. The Lutheran and Reformed Churches in Rhenish Hesse united in 1822 to become the Evangelical Church. The old Saint Martin's Church (St. Martinuskirche) was falling into disrepair and was torn down in 1869, and in 1870 and 1871, the new Evangelical church, which still stands today, was built.Heinrich Steitz: Manuskripte f√ºr eine Chronik von Vendersheim, Mainz, 1984 (unver√∂ffentlicht) = Population development = { border=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0px\\" cellpadding=\\"3px\\" style=\\"border- collapse:collapse;border-color:#638AAD;\\" -----  Year  align=\\"right\\"1904  align=\\"right\\"1905  align=\\"right\\"1950  align=\\"right\\"1972  align=\\"right\\"1982  align=\\"right\\"  1992  align=\\"right\\"2000  align=\\"right\\" 2004  align=\\"right\\" 2005 -----  Inhabitants  align=\\"right\\"  414  align=\\"right\\"  502  align=\\"right\\"  498  align=\\"right\\"  396  align=\\"right\\"  429  align=\\"right\\"  412  align=\\"right\\"  590  align=\\"right\\"  605  align=\\"right\\"  590  }  Politics  = Municipal council = The council is made up of 12 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.Kommunalwahl Rheinland-Pfalz 2009, Gemeinderat = Mayor = * Elfriede Schmitt-Sieben (mayoral election 26 May 2019 with 84,52 % of votes) = Coat of arms = The municipality's arms might be described thus: Per fess gules a demi-lion rampant Or and Or a cross patt√©e of the first issuant from the centre in bend sinister a staff of the first from which a guidon party per fess gules and argent.

History  In 1979, a music shop in Romford, Essex, UK, called Soundwave was building and hiring out PA systems to local musicians. It soon became apparent that some of this equipment was not being used simply as PA but instead was being used by bass players, who for so long had to put up with under-powered amplification that was often merely a guitar amplifier with a modified tone circuit. The Soundwave owner, Fred Friedlein, and staff which included Alan Morgan (sales) and Stuart Watson (design engineer) realised the potential market and developed a range of products that incorporated MOSFET output stages driving large cabinets, including 15‚Äù drivers, and also the world's first bass- dedicated 4 x 10‚Äù cabinet, now an industry standard for all bass amp lines. There were several features which made this product unique: the GP11 pre-amp featured 11 graphic EQ bands which were very broad bands, overlapping each other, thereby enabling massive amounts of frequency cut or boost when adjacent bands were boosted or cut. Secondly, the frequency bands were spaced closer together towards the bass end allowing even more variation for bass guitarists to alter their sound like no other amp had previously allowed. Added to this were MOSFET poweramps of 250 or 500 watts and the option of bi- amplified systems where bass and upper frequencies are filtered before being separately amplified and fed to dedicated high frequency and low frequency speaker cabinets. Trace Elliot, as the brand came to be called, gained a reputation for themselves; rumour has it that early users were John Paul Jones of Led Zeppelin, Andy Rourke of The Smiths and Brian Helicopter of punk band The Shapes. Mark King of Level 42 was also an early adopter of the brand.). ( The company, now dedicated to manufacturing, moved to new premises in Witham, Essex, in 1985 to satisfy the growing demand. In late 1986, Stuart Watson, technical director and designer of the Trace Elliot range up to the Mark 5 series, left the company. That same year Fred Friedlein (then sole owner of Trace Elliot) employed the services of freelance electronics designer Clive Button. In 1986 Mark Gooday was appointed MD and given 24% of the company by Friedlein in thanks for the growth and production changes made by Gooday. In 1989, Trace Elliot introduced the Trace Acoustic range of acoustic amplifiers, whose features were developed by Friedlein, Gooday, Clive Roberts and Clive Button. The company moved again, this time to Maldon, Essex. In 1992 the company was bought by Kaman, which had previously handled the brand's US distribution. The reason for the sale was the need for growth and the importance of the US market. Kaman staff would service a brand but would not grow brands unless they owned them. This arrangement was suggested to Friedlein by Gooday (to whom Friedlein had offered the full company at a very low price). The sale to Kaman meant Friedlein could retire and Gooday could see the brand grow with Kaman. Kaman downsized their music division in 1997 and sold the company to a trio of Trace Elliot directors, who took ownership of a brand with nearly 200 staff on a site; they focused on exploiting the North American market, and in 1998 sold the company to the Gibson Guitar Corporation. In January 2002, the factory was closed and all the staff were laid off. Gibson moved the production of a few particular products they wanted to continue with to various locations in the United States. In April 2005 it was announced that Peavey Electronics had acquired the North American distribution rights to the Trace Elliot brand.Peavey Expands to Distribute Trace Elliot¬Æ in North America Notable products, past and present *GP11 pre-amplifier, very collectable unit combined with various power amp models produced in the 1980s. *1110 Combo, a combination amplifier/speaker unit comprising a GP11 pre-amplifier, V5 mosfet amplifier and 4 x 10‚Äù bass cabinet. *1048H Successor to the world's first dedicated 4 x 10‚Äù bass cabinet. *AH1000-12 Fully featured bass head with 12 Band EQ, Valve Drive, dual band compression and many other features. *Trace Acoustic range.

It was first published by the Hogarth Press in July 1918, after Virginia Woolf encouraged her to finish the story. Mansfield had begun writing Prelude in the midst of a love affair she had in Paris in 1915. It was reprinted in Bliss and Other Stories (1920).Katherine Mansfield, Selected Stories, Oxford World's Classics, explanatory notes The story was a compressed and subtler version of a longer work The Aloe, which was later published posthumously in full. The story is based on the Beauchamps' move to Karori, a country suburb of Wellington, in 1893. Alpers says that some readers may not pick up the numerous hints that Linda is pregnant. Plot summary The story is divided into twelve sections. It opens in medias res, and it is gradually developed that the Burnell family is moving out of their house. I There isn't enough room left on the buggy for Lottie and Kezia to get in because of all the stuff from the removal. A neighbour, Mrs Samuel Josephs, will look after them until another van comes in the evening to pick up other stuff. The children are told to mingle with the neighbours' children, and they are given tea. II Then Kezia goes back into her old house, looks about a few remaining items, then gets scared of something behind her. Lottie draws by and says the storeman is there to pick them up. They leave. III On the road the storeman refers to a lighthouse on Quarantine Island, thus suggesting that the story is set in Wellington. When they arrive, they are greeted by the grandmother; Linda has a headache; she and Aunt Beryl are having tea. Aunt Beryl and Stanley have argued over the fact that he was at work while she was left alone to deal with the removal. IV The grandmother tucks the children in: Lottie and Isabel in the same bed, Kezia with her. Lottie says a prayer. Aunt Beryl dreams of being independent from Stanley. Stanley brags about buying the new house so cheap, then goes to bed with Linda. Pat and the servant girl turn in too. The grandmother goes to bed the last. V The next day, Linda wakes up to a sunny weather and a husband boasting about his physique - she ridicules him slightly. Bored, she thinks of how she dreamt of birds. VI The grandmother is doing the dishes in the kitchen and remembers how, when they lived in Tasmania, Beryl was once stung by a red ant...Then Aunt Beryl wonders where she can put up some paintings she doesn't like. Linda comes up and is sent to the blooming garden to look after her children; Kezia and she look at an aloe. VII Stanley comes back delighted from work with cherries, oysters and a pineapple, willing to see his wife; Linda seems less happy; Aunt Beryl is 'restless'. VIII The girls play at grown-ups, until Pip and Rags, their cousins the Trout boys arrive. The garden is \\"boncer\\" (or bonzer, an Australasian word meaning \\"super\\"). IX Pat chops off a duck's head to show the children that the duck still walks on for some instants after being killed; Kezia is shocked by the episode and demands Pat to \\"Put head back\\" X In the kitchen, Alice is reading a book on dreams; Aunt Beryl comes in and bosses her round, then feels better and walks out. XI They eat the duck for tea. Stanley and Aunt Beryl play a game of cribbage, and he wins. Linda and her mother take a turn in the garden to look at the aloe. To Linda, the tree gets her thinking that she loathes Stanley, and dreams about leaving the house; Mrs Fairfield thinks it would be good to make jam out of the berries in the vegetable garden. XII Aunt Beryl writes a letter to her friend Nan, saying she is bored with living in the countryside, then thinks to herself how despicably false and unhappy with herself she is, until Kezia calls for her to come to dinner.

Geography  = Location = The winegrowing centre lies in Rhenish Hesse and belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of W√∂rrstadt, whose seat is in the like-named municipality. = Neighbouring municipalities = Schornsheim's neighbours are Gabsheim, Udenheim, Undenheim and W√∂rrstadt.  History  = Name‚Äôs origins = The name Schornsheim (in 782 Scoronishaim, in 815 Scornesheim, about 836 Scoranesheim, about 1230 Schornesheym, about 1520 Schornsheim) is formed with the placename ending ‚Äîheim (cognate with English home), as are most Rhenish- Hessian placenames. The other root in the name, however, is something of a peculiarity. It is not a traditional Germanic personal name, nor a word for a natural feature, but rather a title, and only became a personal name through transference. Scoran (cognate with English shorn, and with much the same meaning, referring to a tonsure) was a word used for priests and monks and was given boys as a name who were destined for the clergy, for whom the tonsure had long stood as a defining mark. It could well be that a clergyman of this time gave Schornsheim its name. It is assumed that one or more Frankish settlements had already arisen in the area of what later became Schornsheim, and the unknown priest or monk only later gave the village his name, after he himself had settled there and founded a church and perhaps also a monastery. In one of Charlemagne‚Äôs documents from 28 July 782, the king named Schornsheim‚Äôs church and estate as his property. The ‚Äúestate‚Äù at that time meant the whole of the kingly holdings or a part thereof. How the ruler acquired it is unknown. Whatever it was that happened, it is known that the successor to the estate was the Scoran who had once founded the church. = Saint Leoba = Fountain memorial for Saint Leoba Charlemagne gave the church of the ‚Äúestate‚Äù of Schornsheim with its appurtenances (along with real estate) first as a benefice ‚Äì in effect, a fief, to be used free of charge ‚Äì to Leoba of Tauberbischofsheim, who is still venerated today as Saint Leoba. Leoba, whose Anglo-Saxon name was Leofgyth, was brought up in the convents at Minster in Kent and Wimborne Minster in Dorset. As a woman, she had, after Anglo-Saxon custom, training in languages and theology, which fully equalled a man's. She was related to Saint Boniface, who always had a particular fondness for her. Boniface was critical of the Frankish clergy's crudeness and unlearnedness, which he saw as holdovers from heathen superstition. He tried to remedy these shortcomings with better training at the monasteries. Leoba was best suited to such a programme. She built a convent on an estate in Tauberbischofsheim, which soon became a kind of college for nuns. Leoba did not live exclusively at the convent on the Tauber, though, but rather she regularly undertook visitational journeys to other convents under her authority. Only when she was elderly did she withdraw to the convent that she had chosen as a retirement home. She died there on 28 September 782. Saint Leoba is still venerated today in Schornsheim. The Catholic church bears her name, and in the village square, a fountain has been built that has Saint Leoba standing in the middle. = History of the Schornsheim Ganerbschaft = Before the turmoil in the late 18th century and the new territorial order in the early 19th, the countryside between the Rhine, the Nahe and the Donnersberg ‚Äì what is today called Rhenish Hesse ‚Äì was not in any way a political unit. The Palatinate, Mainz, Waldgrave, Rhinegrave, Nassau and knightly landholding rights all overlapped each other in this area. If the Electorate of the Palatinate wanted to assert itself as the foremost power in this region, then it had about as much success at forging an exclusive territorial zone as Mainz. Very often local lords varied from one place to the next, and there were more than a few cases in which several lordships held ownership rights at the same time. The four jointly owned estates (Ganerbschaften) that were incorporated into the Knightly Canton of Oberrhein, namely Bechtolsheim, Mommenheim, Niedersaulheim and Schornsheim, formed in view of their geographical location the backbone of the Imperial- Knightly holdings in the buffer zone between the two rival territories of the Palatinate and Mainz. = Schornsheim and the tailors = Schornsheim is a village that, in terms of its dwellers‚Äô wealth and level of employment, is comparable to many other villages. This was not always so. A hundred years ago, Schornsheim was known as a ‚Äútailoring village‚Äù. There were more than 130 tailors and whole families made their livelihood at tailoring, sewing for factories in Mainz, Worms and Darmstadt. Each tailor worked at his or her speciality, with some producing only trousers, and still others making only jackets. Once a week, the finished garments were then delivered to the factory. The tailors mostly lived in little, single-story loam houses with two or three windows facing onto the street, or sometimes only one, for a window tax was levied in those days. The tailors‚Äô livingroom became their workshop in which several sewing machines would be set up along with a great tailor's table. Father, mother, daughters and sons worked on into the night so that they could earn enough to feed themselves, for these tailors earned very little money. A great many skirts, trousers and vests had to make their way out of the workshop before a Schornsheim home worker could enjoy the pleasures of owning his own house and property. Many tailors also had a field plot, in which they planted potatoes and grain. At home, they had a pig in the stable that would be slaughtered when it got big enough, or a goat ‚Äì the so-called ‚Äútailor‚Äôs cow‚Äù ‚Äì for its milk. However, as factories streamlined their production, making themselves cheaper to run, less and less work came the tailors‚Äô way, eventually forcing them to seek other work. Many sought it in the industrial works in Mainz or in the Opel Works in R√ºsselsheim, where they earned much more and came to know a kind of luxury, at least compared to what they had known before. Today there is not even one tailor in the municipality; the profession has died out. However, when one walks through the streets, especially on Karl-Marx-Stra√üe, one still finds the odd typical tailor's house. = 18th century =  Poor money  From 1715 comes the story that accountant Lorenz Tautph√§us was taking in ‚Äúcloth money‚Äù (Tuchgeld). Certain fields in the municipal area had this so-called Tuchgeld imposed on them, which was used to buy the local poor some clothing.  Jews in Schornsheim  Between 1713 and 1738, nine Jewish families lived in the village. Each family had to pay 3 guilders in ‚ÄúJew protection money‚Äù (Judenschutzgeld), after which they were entitled to live in the village and go about their business unhindered. Some Jews were merchants and others were butchers.  Night watchman  In earlier years, the night watchman's job was an important one. His service was laid out as follows in 1712: :‚ÄúThey have to blow :# towards the Schulthei√ü‚Äôs house, :# at the Schmitt Bridge, :# at Nikolaus Kneip‚Äôs house, :# at Jakob‚Äôs board house, :# at the rectory, :# at the Pfaffenwald well. :While doing this the night watchmen should at each post where they blow, whenever the hour rings, call out what hour has struck.‚Äù  Day watchman  Such a man took up this work in 1725. Of this, it was written: ‚ÄúBy the whole municipality it was deemed advisable that a day watchman, who would go about the village the whole day long bearing a spear, and whatever strange beggars come in, he should forthwith turn them out, such would happen in the surrounding places. The day watchman should receive from each man in the municipality a loaf of bread and from the municipality a pair of shoes as wages.‚Äù  Swineherd  In 1713, Nikolaus Lademann was hired as the swineherd. He received as wages ‚Äú7 Malter of corn and from each one who drives swine, a loaf of bread, and the said one should drive the swine if the weather is good.‚Äù In 1722, the new swineherd received for each pig ‚Äúthus driven‚Äù one fourth of a loaf of bread. He had to watch the swine as long as people ‚Äúdrove‚Äù them to him.  ‚ÄúFirewalkers‚Äù  In 1722, six men were hired as ‚Äúfirewalkers‚Äù (Feuerl√§ufer), although this did not mean, as both the German and English words do nowadays, people who walk barefoot across hot coals. These were firefighters of a kind, but of course without modern equipment. One among them was the fire captain. Whenever a fire broke out anywhere, they had to walk for up to three hours to reach the fire to help put it out. However, they could not leave the scene until they had been given a certificate witnessing their efforts. Each also had to take along his leather pail on the job. When they came back, they were to get from the municipality two Ma√ü of wine and each was to get white bread for one Albus. In 1731, it was written: ‚ÄúThey should go after the fire as far as the Rhine or four hours‚Äô walk away and then bring back a certificate, then they should have from the municipality 1 quarter of wine and for an alb. white bread and Volpert Sandmann should be the fire captain.‚Äù = 19th century = In 1840 the Evangelical clergyman Pfeiffer declared that his parish had wished ‚Äúfor the longest time and most longingly‚Äù a separation of churches from the Catholic parish and for a new Evangelical church to be built. There was also more payment for the extermination of mice, hamsters and wasps. In 1848, Ludwig H., born and living in Schornsheim, had himself registered as a local citizen and paid the ‚Äúfire pail money‚Äù. Owing to his intended marriage, however, the council raised an objection, because the said man had no kind of estate, neither practising a business nor being ‚Äúbusy‚Äù in agriculture, and about the woman's assets, nothing was known. ‚ÄúOne can assume that the said man cannot feed this female person with her two illegitimate children, much less should this family grow yet bigger.‚Äù In 1850, to build the Evangelical church, the church did not want to use any stone from the Flonheim quarries because for these stones, a road improvement tax would have had to be paid. Instead, the church wanted to draw stone from the Oppenheim quarries, as those stones were free of this tax. In 1856, chickens and geese were once again tended by Ludwig H√∂hler with his sister for a wage of 30 guilders. He further received, as was customary, one pound of bread from each owner of one of those geese. The vineyard marksmen now had to go to work every day. A day's wages for each was 24 Kreuzer. In 1857, Philipp Geogi wanted to travel to his son in Z√ºrich as there were better food and care there than in Schornsheim. The municipality was ready to give him money for clothing for the trip, but as security, they wanted to pay the fare only at the railway station from which he was to begin his trip. His son was a tinsmith in Z√ºrich. The council decided that on 23 June, the meadows would be opened. The grass was to be mown and taken away forthwith. The council objected to local citizen Mathias Z.‚Äôs marriage to Maria Chatharina J. from W√∂rrstadt. ‚ÄúZ. enjoys evil repute and has with a person from the Duchy of Nassau undergone an immoral change and has had children with the same. He is a blasphemer and given to drink. His fianc√©e also possesses a frivolous character and is said already to have had two children out of wedlock with another person.‚Äù In 1858, a gift was to be given the Grand Duke for his silver wedding anniversary. A council member agreed. All the other members, though, refused any gift. They declared that the municipality was so beleaguered by roadbuilding, the acquisition of two fire sprayers and other outlays that it had to be mindful of even the smallest savings. In November, however, deliberated once again the gift for the Grand Duke. ‚ÄúIt would be unworthy if the municipality of Schornsheim wanted to exclude itself from the grand festival.‚Äù A collection gathered up 25 guilders for the gift. In 1859 the council refused Carl. L. Bi√ümann, at the time living in Neuch√¢tel, an early marriage. ‚ÄúEven if the petitioner (applicant) at the moment has good earnings but the marriage dies before he is 25 years of age, the foreign-born woman and any possible children would become a burden to the municipality of Schornsheim. He may wait until he is of the legally prescribed age.‚Äù In 1860, stones for improving roads were to be bought in the quantity of 9 fathoms. The stones were to be knocked asunder by debtors who were being punished as such. Their wages were to be deducted from their debt. ‚ÄúThe ‚Äòconvicts‚Äô recognized as being unable to pay have, however, hitherto through petitions for deadlines and assorted evasions, sought to get out of doing this work.‚Äù J.L.H. asked for support from the municipal coffers. The council‚Äôs opinion was as follows: ‚ÄúApplicant is a sturdy man of 37 years, who from youth onwards adapted himself to begging. He calls himself a day labourer, but will work for nobody and busies himself merely with gathering horse dung in the streets, where he can be an idler. He could have work the year round in fieldwork and in winter in threshing. This year he was offered work in caring for geese, for which he could have earned from May to November 40 guilders and for each goose a pound of bread, but which he also did not take on. His wife, 36 years old, strong and healthy, is just as shy of work; even in the harvest these two highly lazy people take on no harvesting work. About this, the whole municipality is angered and gives nothing further. The policeman has the duty of disrupting begging. Were it further allowed the couple, they would have been able to live continually without fending for food. Such people are unworthy of being supported.‚Äù In Undenheim a postal station was to be built. Schornsheim, however, held that the location near W√∂rrstadt was more advantageous given the Justice of the Peace and the tax commission's office there. The municipality dismissed Ph. M. from his job as gooseherd ‚Äúbecause he does not busy himself at all with herding geese, his wife only seldom. The geese would be driven out of the village to the field only seldom, and given over to his children, who are supposed to go to school, who let the geese run around in the fields at will. Now, to guard the fields against further damage, he is discharged as gooseherd.‚Äù In 1861, after the Grand-Ducal government's agreement with the Thurn und Taxis postal administration, the council declared: ‚ÄúThe municipality wants to forgo a six-time errand and only pay the bringer‚Äôs wages for the governmental paper‚Äù. The municipality did not need to procure any post boxes. Also, as two fruit dealers were already resident in Schornsheim, the council held that a further one was unneeded. In 1862, because sparrows had grown so greatly in number and were doing such great harm in the fields, every citizen at his own expense had to deliver 2 to 6 sparrows. Also, because the plague of rabbits in the municipal area was getting out of hand, a man from Bechtheim who owned a ferret was to come to help. The proceeds from the rabbits were to flow into the municipality's coffers. In 1863, the rabbit problem had still not been overcome, and anyone who killed or presented a rabbit was to get 6 Kreuzer for each one from the municipality's coffers. The council also decided that the corn hamster, which had also got out of hand, had to be exterminated. For each killed or delivered hamster, 3 Kreuzer would be paid out. (Even by the years 1950‚Äì1960, hamsters were still being caught and would earn the catcher 1.80 DM each). In 1870, the well in the Pfaffenwald (forest) was not supplying enough water to those who dwelt there or their livestock. At that time, there was a great need for water in Schornsheim. The council stated in August of that year that it was needless to build a new well before the Heyertor (gate), as it had rained long and persistently. On 30 July that same year, Jakob Tautph√§us delivered a horse and a waggon to send to war in France. Philipp Ebling gave a second horse. Both also gave a second man. On 28 September, though, one of the men came back with the war waggon and a strange horse. According to him, his fellow warrior and his horse had both been killed in France. On 8 October, the municipal council was complaining about the policeman. He was apparently much given to drink and had already been negligent in doing his duty for years. Also, some nighttime disturbances of the peace were not coming to his attention as he did his nightly rounds. Furthermore, he had failed to appoint other citizens each evening in addition to the serving security watches for the nighttime criminality that was getting out of hand. The policeman was to be dismissed, the more so as he had thrown his sabre and duty book into the mayor's livingroom. Five persons sought the fired policeman's job. The wages amounted to 40 guilders. The policeman also had to act as a court official and a field marksman for the nearby surrounding area. The municipality had to borrow capital amounting to 1,500 guilders to be able to indemnify those from Schornsheim who had gone to war in France. On 18 October came a report of a typhus outbreak. In 1871, the municipal council believed that ‚ÄúThe investigation of wellwater with regard to the illness, which led to no result, could have been saved, as nothing could be confirmed.‚Äù In 1880, the policeman was dismissed, as on some days he was not to be seen in the village, as a result of which ‚Äúwith begging getting out of hand, the vagabonds can go about begging undisturbed. His other functions he has also badly neglected.‚Äù In 1881 a new knacker was hired. He received 1.50 to 2.00 Marks for each cattle or horse carcass that he skinned and buried. For foals, calves or swine he got 50 Pfennigs. Horses and cattle had to be delivered to the knacker's yard; other livestock had to be fetched by the knacker. In 1897, a day's wages (not hourly) were set out in Schornsheim. The rates were as follows: :for grown workmen 1 Mark 80 Pfennigs :for grown workwomen 1 Mark 20 Pfennigs :for youthful workmen 1 Mark 20 Pfennigs :for youthful workwomen 80 Pfennigs Also, the municipality wanted to forbid free ranging of geese on Sundays and holidays. = 20th century = In 1903, by the district office's decree, the council decided to put the old elmtree ‚Äì the so-called Heyerbaum ‚Äì under monumental protection. :Source for foregoing:Ausschnitte aus der Chronik von Schornsheim, 1200 Jahre Schornsheim, 782‚Äì1982  Politics  = Municipal council = The council is made up of 16 council members, who were elected at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.

History  In 776, Flarlesheim superiori had its first documentary mention in a donation document from Lorsch Abbey. From 1237 until the late 18th century, the Teutonic Knights ran a commandry in the village. From 1506, Ober-Fl√∂rsheim belonged to Electoral Palatinate and was made part of the Oberamt of Alzey. In the Thirty Years' War, Swedish troops laid waste the commandry and the village. In 1689, the village was dealt a further blow by French troops under King Louis XIV when they laid the Palatinate waste during the Nine Years' War. During the wars in the wake of the French Revolution, there was a battle on 30 March 1793 near Ober-Fl√∂rsheim in which the Prussians beat the French. Even so, this defeat would not thwart France‚Äôs ultimate success in the campaign, and thereby Ober-Fl√∂rsheim, along with the rest of the territories on the Rhine‚Äôs left bank, was annexed by France in 1797, and the village became part of the Department of Mont-Tonnerre (or Donnersberg in German). After the Napoleonic Empire had been defeated, Ober-Fl√∂rsheim became part of the newly founded province of Rhenish Hesse (Rheinhessen) in the Grand Duchy of Hesse- Darmstadt in 1816. On 20 March 1945, American troops occupied Ober-Fl√∂rsheim, which nevertheless was transferred to the French zone of occupation in the summer of that same year, later also being grouped into the newly formed state of Rhineland-Palatinate, to which the village has belonged ever since. The region, though, is still called Rhenish Hesse, even though it is no longer part of Hesse. Since 1972, Ober-Fl√∂rsheim has also belonged to the Verbandsgemeinde of Alzey-Land.

The Reformed once again achieved ascendancy over the parish church in 1705 with the Palatine Church Sharing (Pf√§lzische Kirchenteilung, whereby Protestants had to share their churches with Catholics). For a long time, the two denominations stood side by side. In 1747, the Lutherans came to be the third denomination in the village, and they were able to build their own church. In 1876, the Free Protestant parish, a breakaway group from the Evangelical Church, was founded. = Population development = *1787 - 516 inhabitants *1815 - 851 inhabitants *1849 - 1,223 inhabitants (858 Evangelical, 272 Catholic, 91 Mennonite) *1870 - 1,094 inhabitants (799 Evangelical, 265 Catholic, 44 Mennonite) *1900 - 1,014 inhabitants (533 Evangelical, 236 Catholic, 231 Free Protestant, 21 Mennonite) *2004 - 1,104 inhabitants *2008 - 1,191 inhabitants (566 Evangelical, 331 Roman Catholic, 67 other, 227 none) *2012 - 1.237 inhabitants (575 Evangelical, 344 Roman Catholic, 35 other, 283 none) *2014 - 1.205 inhabitants (531 Evangelical, 317 Roman Catholic, 34 other, 323 none) The memorial to those from Ober-Fl√∂rsheim who fought in the Franco-Prussian War.

In 2002, the Ober- Fl√∂rsheim local history and cultural club was founded, which has since acquired about 80 members. = Music = Besides the S√§ngerkranz (‚ÄúSinger Wreath‚Äù) men‚Äôs singing club established in 1855, which despite being called a ‚Äúmen‚Äôs‚Äù singing club also has a women‚Äôs choir, there are also the Catholic Church music club established in 1912, and an Evangelical church choir. = Buildings = Saint Peter‚Äôs and Saint Paul‚Äôs Catholic Parish Church (Pfarrkirche St. Peter und Paul) was built in 1776 and 1777 on the spot where once stood the old parish church. That one was assigned to followers of the Reformed Church at the time of the Palatine Church Sharing in 1705. The Teutonic Knights however, who held the patronage for the Catholic parish, opposed the decision and waged a long legal battle for ownership for the Catholics. Meanwhile, as a result of the disagreements, the old church was falling apart, making it necessary to build the new Renaissance building that stands now. The belltower was built onto the church only in 1930. = Sport = The TSG 1863 Ober-Fl√∂rsheim (sport club) offers, among other things, gymnastics, partner dancing, taekwondo, tennis and football.  Famous people  = Sons and daughters of the town = *Sebastian Walter, b. 1848, d. 1922 in Milwaukee, manufacturer (emigrated to Milwaukee in 1866) * Willy Deutschmann, b. 1880, d. 1960 in Petersb√§chel, painter, was active in Petersb√§chel in the Wasgau (Alsace border region in Rhineland-Palatinate).

Geography  = Location = The municipality lies in Rhenish Hesse and belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Alzey-Land, whose seat is in Alzey. It has roughly 650 inhabitants. In Nieder- Wiesen, the Rheinhessisches H√ºgelland (Rhenish-Hessian Upland) gives way to the foothills of the North Palatine Highland, thus explaining the former presence of the old border running along the Wiesbach 500 m south of the village which once marked the place where the Grand Duchy of Hesse (‚ÄúGH‚Äù) met the Palatine exclave ruled by the Kingdom of Bavaria (‚ÄúKB‚Äù). Even today along the old border, border stones can be found with the aforesaid initials on them. Even today's district boundary between Alzey-Worms and the Donnersbergkreis follows this alignment, as does the jurisdictional boundary between the Evangelical Church in Hesse and Nassau and the Evangelical Church of the Palatinate. The particularly lovely rural location on the Wiesbach ‚Äì nowadays known as the Rhenish-Hessian Switzerland (Rheinhessische Schweiz) ‚Äì must have appealed to the Celts, who built a place of worship or perhaps even a castle on the Schlossberg (mountain).  Religion  Nieder-Wiesen is a mostly Protestant village. There is an Evangelical church. Only in neighbouring villages can a Catholic church be found. Before the persecution and outright murder wrought by the National Socialists, Nieder-Wiesen was home to a remarkably large Jewish community that formed about a third of the population. Their synagogue was set on fire and destroyed as part of Kristallnacht (9 November 1938). Witness thereto is a memorial plaque at the Evangelical church. Also bearing witness to the former Jewish community is the Jewish graveyard lying roughly 400 m south of the village.  Politics  = Municipal council = The council is made up of 12 council members, who were elected at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman. The municipal election held on 7 June 2009 yielded the following results:Kommunalwahl Rheinland-Pfalz 2009, Gemeinderat { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" width=\\"400\\" - bgcolor=\\"#eeeeee\\" align=\\"center\\"   SPD  CDU  FWG  Total - align=\\"center\\"  2009  4  3  5  12 seats - align=\\"center\\"  2004  5  3  4  12 seats } = Mayors = * Friedrich Brunk - SPD (1999 - 2004) * Hans Wilhelm Kern - FWG (2004‚Äìpresent) = Coat of arms = The municipality's arms might be described thus: Argent between two bars gules the letters N and W sable flanked by two blocks of the second, in chief four blocks in fess of the second, in base two blocks in fess of the second.  Economy and infrastructure  = Public institutions =  Sport and leisure facilities  Besides the sport facilities usually found in such a small village (grass football pitch with sport club house), there are two tennis courts right in the village centre. There is a big youth tent site in the Wiesbach valley where one can stay overnight in a cabin along with a community centre. In the warmer months, tents are also pitched. This place, near nature and the forest, is wonderfully suited to tent camping and children's and youth's leisure activities. Along with these comes the opportunity to take part in the Alzey Forest Bureau's woodland education programme. The youth tent site (Jugendzeltplatz) is run by the Alzey-Worms district, Alzey. Nieder-Wiesen also has a barbecue area run by the Rhenish-Hessian Switzerland Recreational Area Association with a big barbecue pavilion as well as equipment. It is to be found across from the sport facilities at the edge of the woods. Also to be found lying before the youth tent site in Nieder-Wiesen is a big Wanderparkplatz (‚Äúhiking park square‚Äù) with information and display notices about the trails that have been laid out and marked and the Nordic walking courses through the Vorholz Forest Area. There is a permanent (IVV) hiking trail, a loop through the Vorholz, running for 10 km through the Rhenish-Hessian Switzerland. It begins and ends at the TuS (sport club) Nieder-Wiesen's clubhouse at the sport ground. = Community centres = The Gemeindehalle (‚Äúmunicipal hall‚Äù) is a converted barn of a former typically Frankish homestead. The building's original character was retained, and it offers a nice ambiance for celebrations. Equipped with a modern kitchen, drink cooling, stage and gallery, it can handle an event with up to 150 persons. It can be hired through the municipal administration. The B√ºrgerhaus (‚Äúcitizens‚Äô house‚Äù) with its kitchen and great hall is part of the former school (a modern wing built in 1988) and it can likewise be hired through the municipal administration. = Education =  Kindergarten  The municipal kindergarten has one group with places for 25 children. The institution is certified by the state of Rhineland-Palatinate as a Bewegungskindergarten (one that emphasizes physical activity as a paedagogical tool). = Transport = The nearest railway stations are Alzey (11 km east of Nieder-Wiesen with half-hourly Regionalexpress trains to Mainz and hourly Regionalbahn trains to Worms, Bingen am Rhein and Kirchheimbolanden) and Alsenz (17 km west with regular connections to Bad Kreuznach and Kaiserslautern). A bus link, route 425 run by Omnibusverkehr Rhein-Nahe, to and from the district seat of Alzey runs on weekdays. Moreover, several shared-taxi connections are daily at hand.  Culture and sightseeing = Buildings =  Evangelical church  The Evangelical church is a Baroque one-room structure built in 1723 as the then resident church of the Barons of Hunolstein on the spot where once had stood another church built in 1462. Remains of the nobles‚Äô seat are still recognizable inside. The church is equipped with the oldest and smallest Stumm organ in Rhenish Hesse (from about 1725) with a stylish character (eight stops). On one side wall are found the family Hunolstein's graves, and on the other the Reverend Johann Wilhelm Fresenius's (died 1727), whose son Johann Philipp not only served as a clergyman in Nieder-Wiesen, but also later, as a senior clergyman in Frankfurt am Main, ministered to Johann Wolfgang von Goethe‚Äôs parents and even christened the poet himself shortly after his birth. Furthermore, the clerical family Fresenius‚Äôs descendants founded a healthcare business that today is active worldwide, and also a well known chemical analysis institute. Baroque pastoral paintings adorn the pulpit with the Four Evangelists, and along the gallery balustrade‚Äôs whole breadth, a painting of the Twelve Apostles with Jesus in the middle can be seen. From early Lutheran times come the Eucharist chests, which are scattered about the altar area. Since 1822, the parish has been Evangelical-United. The font comes from 1971 and was originally in the Immanuel-Kirche in K√∂nigstein im Taunus, but did not arrive in Nieder-Wiesen without a sojourn first in Ringleben in the Kyffh√§userkreis in Thuringia, finally coming back to western Germany and its new home in Nieder-Wiesen in 1996. Artistically valuable are the altar antependia, among others a work in appliqu√© after a concept by Darmstadt artist Thomas Duttenh√∂fer from 1989 called ‚ÄúJesus‚Äôs Entry into Jerusalem‚Äù. Upon close inspection, though, it turns out that the place depicted in the work, far from being the Holy City, is in fact Nieder-Wiesen, with its former synagogue on fire. The church's loft is used for a bat and barn owl project as a measure to safeguard Creation. In 2000, the church's outside was given an extensive renovation, and in 2008, the inside was also done. The entrance portal is furnished with the clerical family Fresenius's heraldic motto from Psalm 92: Die gepflanzt sind im Hause des Herrn, werden in den Vorh√∂fen unseres Gottes gr√ºnen (‚ÄúPlanted in the Lord‚Äôs house, they grow in the courts of our God‚ÄùText of Psalm 92), and above is found the Hunolstein family's former coat of arms with the noble crown. The coat of arms ‚Äì albeit now without the noble crown ‚Äì with the marking ‚ÄúNW‚Äù to make it Nieder-Wiesen's civic arms was set into the street paving in 2000 in the square before the church. Across from the church, on the bank of the Wiesbach, stands a ‚ÄúResista‚Äù elm as a measure to fight Dutch elm disease in Rhenish Hesse. (‚ÄúResista‚Äù cultivars are supposed to have very high resistance to this fungal affliction). A few metres farther is found the stylishly shaped memorial to victims of the First and Second World Wars.  Schloss Nieder- Wiesen  In the village stands a former moated castle, although nowadays, no more water flows through the moat. This was built in 1722 by the Barons of Hunolstein, who helped the region attain both prestige and wealth by mining quicksilver. Today, the small castle with its Baroque-style gardens is in private ownership. Still to be found on the stucco ceiling in the former reception hall are allegorical representations of the four seasons. The former stable with its vaulting serves today as a ballroom. It can be hired for events.  Nieder-Wiesen ford  A ford in the municipal area is crossing the Wiesbach. The 4 m-wide brook can be crossed here even in vehicles, although it is advisable to note the water conditions beforehand. The open area before the ford was built as a rest area on the Napoleon-Kneipp Hiking Trail, which runs through Nieder-Wiesen, with a Kneipp arm bath basin and an informational notice.  Neum√ºhle with waterwheel  Roughly one kilometre outside the village towards Wendelsheim is found the Neum√ºhle (‚ÄúNew Mill‚Äù), a former Hunolstein homestead. Worth seeing here is the fully functional overshot waterwheel, which today is run to generate renewable electrical energy from the flowing water. = Countryside =  Streuobstwiese ‚ÄúAuf der Gipp‚Äù  On the way out of the village towards Wendelsheim, started in 1991, is a meadow orchard or streuobstwiese. Its area is about 1 ha, and there are all kinds of native fruit trees planted there that once grew all around the village of Nieder-Wiesen in great numbers. Seeing to the ecological management is the Evangelical church (there is a yearly ‚Äúapple juice project‚Äù). An informational notice explaining the various fruit trees can be found at the orchard's lower edge, and at the upper end is an ‚Äúinsect hotel‚Äù, installed in 2008.

The film depicts a street gang leader setting out for revenge against a rival street gang. It was filmed in Dayton, Ohio.  Plot  The main character is Goose (Van Bebber). Goose is leader of \\"The Ravens\\", a street gang located in Dayton, Ohio. The Ravens have an ongoing feud with \\"The Spiders\\", led by a sadistic goon called Danny (Paul Harper). Goose loves the criminal life, but when his girlfriend Christie (Megan Murphy) threatens to leave him, he quits the Ravens. First, he goes on one last drug deal to get money to fund a new life with Christie. While he is gone, two Spiders break into Goose's apartment, killing Christie in the process. When Goose finds her body, he feeds her corpse to a trash compactor and then moves in with his Vietnam Veteran junkie father. He then gets drunk at a bar. The Ravens organise a hit and coerce Goose into joining them in a plot to steal $100,000 cash from the federal government. For this and a follow-up deal, they agree to put aside their differences with the Spiders and agree to meet at a place where nobody is armed in order to carry out the transaction safely. Goose plans on taking the money directly from the drop and secretly arms himself--unbeknownst to him, the Spiders were laying a trap. The Ravens are killed but Goose manages to escape with the money, calling Christie's sister he arranges a meetup near a freight train station in order to give her the money, lying to her by saying her sister is still alive. As he makes his way to the meeting point he's spotted by one of the members of the Spiders. As he waits for Christie's sister to arrive he falls asleep, awaking he finds himself cornered and a fight ensues. The fight extends to the streets below whereby Christie's sister arrives and is threatened by one of the other gang members. Goose fights him off and kills him but in doing so is stabbed multiple times in the kidney and begins to lose a lot of blood. He greets Christie's sister and hands her the money, urging her to flee; upon her questioning he reveals that Christie is in fact dead. Walking away from her he begins to make his way into a well-populated street before collapsing onto the ground as sirens can be heard in the background.

Release Deadbeat at Dawn was shown at The Dayton Movies theatre in Dayton, Ohio on November 18, 1988. After the film initial VHS release by Ketchum Video, Van Bebber spoke in 1991 that he was \\"trying to get out of that contract. They haven't spoken with us for over four months.\\" and that he had \\"yet to see the first dollar from its \\"sale\\".\\" Van Bebber later spoke on the home video releases of the film in 2018, stating that \\"We had to learn the hard way by working with people who didn't pan out or would rip us off. There was a distributor in New York where all our contracts turned to dust. Then there was the VHS deal which was a glimpse into how I would be treated with the next release on DVD, which was a total lack of any business decorum. It was frustrating.\\" Synapse Films released Deadbeat at Dawn in 1999. The film was included in the release of \\"Visions of Hell: The Films of Jim VanBebber\\" compilation in 2008 by Dark Sky Films, which Van Bebber found that the film \\"didn't get its proper respect until the Dark Sky release. I know other people might disagree, but they weren't on the business end of things. The Dark Sky box set brought a newer audience of the film and to me.\\" Arrow Video released the film in 2019 on Blu-ray. Van Bebber commented on Arrow's release stating that the way the film was handled by Arrow \\"totally buries all of the other companies that have dealt with it in the past. They're treating it like it's an important film that needs to be respected. After all these years, that's vindication.\\" Reception In a contemporary review, Terry Lawson gave the film a two stars out of five rating, referring to the film as \\"part action film, part horror pastiche, part home movie and all pure, raw energy\\" stating it was \\"garish, violent and purposely absurd little action thriller\\" which had \\"about twice the impact of most films of its kind - whatever that kind might be.\\" Lawson concluded that Van bebber and \\"specifically photographer Mike King\\" have \\"an inherent understanding of how movies work: Deadbeat at Dawn may be crude and silly and even incoherent at times, but it has an undeniable vitality and a snotty sense of style: It is never dull.\\" From retrospective reviews, Nick Pinkerton of Sight & Sound described the film as a \\"incredible no-budget mend-and-make ingenuity\\" that was as \\"kinetic, visceral, and palpably danger as anything then coming out of Hong Kong.\\" Jason Buchanan of AllMovie referred to the film as a \\"prime example of creativity and enthusiasm picking up where budget and other resources fall short\\", calling the film a \\"pleasantly surprising mini-masterpiece of gritty urban nightmares. Viewers may initially chuckle at how many times van Bebber's name appears in the credits, attached to virtually every component of the film's production from editing to special effects, but they will come to appreciate the sometimes subtle (and other times less so) creative touches that he lends to the various aspects of the film\\".

Geography  = Location = The municipality lies in the Palatinate and the Rhine-Neckar urban agglomeration. It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Leiningerland, whose seat is in Gr√ºnstadt, although that town is itself not in the Verbandsgemeinde. Bockenheim lies at the north end of the 85 km-long German Wine Route, and has even adopted an epithet referring to its location there: an der Weinstra√üe means ‚Äúon the Wine Route‚Äù in German. The Route runs concurrently here with Bundesstra√üe 271.  History  Bockenheim is made up of two smaller centres called Gro√übockenheim and Kleinbockenheim (gro√ü means ‚Äúgreat‚Äù and klein ‚Äúlittle‚Äù), which were merged in 1956. The two places arose from small settlements that themselves had grown out of Frankish estates after the Franks took the land about 500.

In April 1525, in the Palatine Peasants‚Äô War ‚Äì part of the German Peasants' War ‚Äì the Bockenheimer Haufen (‚ÄúBockenheim Cohort‚Äù) was formed, a rabble of peasants who joined the uprising. Until 1969, Bockenheim belonged to the now abolished district of Frankenthal (Landkreis Frankenthal). Since then it has been in what was then the newly formed district of Bad D√ºrkheim (Landkreis Bad D√ºrkheim). In 2018, it was grouped into the newly formed Verbandsgemeinde of Leiningerland.

Martin of Tours is the local church's patron saint, also bearing his name (Martinskirche, or Saint Martin's Church). The billygoat (Ziegenbock in German) is a canting charge for the municipality's name. Bockenheim's arms are based on the two constituent communities‚Äô coat of arms.

From the 11th century comes the tower at the Romanesque Saint Martin's Church (Martinskirche), which once stood next to the Emichsburg, a castle belonging to the Counts of Leiningen, after which today's community centre is named. The castle, after being destroyed many times, was eventually converted into a residential castle, which itself was also destroyed. Its remnants have been incorporated into a winery, which bears the name Schlossgut (‚ÄúCastle Estate‚Äù) in memory of the now mostly vanished complex. In 1995, to offer a counterpart to the ‚ÄúGerman Wine Gate‚Äù (Deutsches Weintor) at the other end of the German Wine Route in Schweigen, which since 1936 had been marking the route's far (from Bockenheim's point of view) end, the Haus der Deutschen Weinstra√üe (‚ÄúHouse of the German Wine Route‚Äù) was built between Gro√übockenheim and Kleinbockenheim. Built in the style of a Roman castrum, the House spans the road like a bridge and affords room not only for a 120-place restaurant with a lakeside terrace, but also for various event venues. In the Turmzimmer (‚ÄúTower Room‚Äù) with its view of the surrounding vineyards, the Upper Rhine Plain and even the Odenwald, those wishing to be wed may have a Weinstra√üenhochzeit (‚ÄúWine Route Wedding‚Äù). = Local speech = Since 1953, the Palatine Dialectal Poetry Contest (Pf√§lzischer Mundartdichterwettstreit) has been being held each October, at which participants who speak and write in the Palatine Dialect meet. The jury chooses the best ten poems from among their entries. At the Bockenheimer Mundarttagen (‚ÄúBockenheim Dialect Days‚Äù), held each year on a weekend in May, dialectologists give lectures in public about dialects and discuss them, too ‚Äì traditionally in dialect ‚Äì at the podium.  Economy and infrastructure  Bockenheim is an old winegrowing centre in which the craft has been practised for more than 1,200 years. Even today, it is still the village's most important industry. Bockenheim's vineyards stretch for more than 400 ha. Nevertheless, tourism is also growing in importance. = Transport = Along Bundesstra√üe 271, which still runs as a narrow and winding road through the middle of the village, is an interchange on the Autobahn A 6 (Mannheim‚ÄìSaarbr√ºcken) that runs by 6 km to the south. For years, there have been efforts to have a village bypass built. The Pf√§lzische Nordbahn between Monsheim and Gr√ºnstadt runs by at the village's eastern edge. The halt Bockenheim-Kindenheim is served by Regionalbahn trains running on ‚ÄúRhineland- Palatinate timing‚Äù.

It was first published in Athenaeum on 26 November 1920, and later reprinted in The Garden Party and Other Stories.Katherine Mansfield, Selected Stories, Oxford World's Classics, explanatory notes Plot summary Miss Brill is an English teacher living near the Public Gardens in a French town. The narrative follows her on a regular Sunday afternoon, which she spends walking about and sitting in the park. The story opens with Miss Brill delighting in her decision to wear her fur. She notices that there are more park-goers than there were last Sunday, and that the band is more enthusiastic because the Season has commenced. Miss Brill observes facets of the lives around her, \\"listening as though she didn't listen, ...sitting in other people's lives just for a minute while they talked round her\\". She sees the world as a play: as though her surroundings are a set and she and her fellow park-goers actors. She imagines that the band's performance corresponds with and highlights the park's happenings. When the band strikes up a new song, Miss Brill envisions everyone in the park taking part in the song and singing. She begins to cry at the thought. A young couple arrive and share Miss Brill's bench. Miss Brill believes they are nicely dressed and warmly pictures them as the \\"hero and heroine\\" of the play. However, she overhears the boy make a rude remark about Miss Brill being a \\"stupid old thing\\", and the girl agrees, \\"It's her fu-fur which is so funny.\\" On a typical Sunday, Miss Brill would stop by the bakery, but on this particular day, she goes straight home to a dark room.

Geography  = Location = The municipality lies in the Palatinate along the northernmost stretch of the German Wine Route. Dackenheim lies in the foothills between the Palatinate Forest and the Upper Rhine Plain. It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Freinsheim, whose seat is in the like-named town. = Climate = Yearly precipitation in Dackenheim amounts to 534 mm, which is very low, falling into the lowest tenth of the precipitation chart for all Germany. Only at 8% of the German Weather Service's weather stations are even lower figures recorded. The driest month is January. The most rainfall comes in May. In that month, precipitation is 1.9 times what it is in January. Precipitation otherwise hardly varies over the year. At 32% of the weather stations, lower seasonal swings are recorded.  History  As the Dackenheim golf course was being built in 1998, witnesses to prehistory were unearthed in the shape of potsherds, which were identified as being from the R√∂ssen culture (4700-4500 BC), leading to the inference that Dackenheim, like the neighbouring town of Freinsheim, might have been settled as early as the New Stone Age. Another find in 1952, with a sandstone human head, might be from the Bronze Age. It can now be found in the Historisches Museum der Pfalz (‚ÄúHistorical Museum of the Palatinate‚Äù). = Franks and Carolingians = Any evidence of human activity in Roman times has not been forthcoming. The placename ending ‚Äîheim (cognate with English home) suggests that Dackenheim might have been founded about 600, at the time when the Franks were taking the land. Clear clues as to settlement in Merovingian times come from grave goods unearthed in 1910 in the rural cadastral area ‚ÄúIn den 24 Morgen‚Äù, and others brought to light in 1976 in the field ‚ÄúAm Liebesbrunnen‚Äù. The village had its first documentary mention on 22 November 766 in the acts of Lorsch Abbey (document 1143) as Donatio Nantheri in Dagastisheim (Nanther's donation in Dackenheim). = 12th to 18th century = In the 12th century, Dackenheim was within the Leiningen Counts‚Äô sphere of influence. It was in this time that the Catholic church was built (1147). In the wake of the Mainz Monasterial Feud ‚Äì also known as the Baden- Palatinate War ‚Äì (1461‚Äì1462) and after Margarethe von Leiningen-Westerburg's death, Dackenheim passed in 1471 to Electoral Palatinate. The main source for the time that followed is the Dackenheimer Weistum of 1485, 1496 and 1579 (a Weistum ‚Äì cognate with English wisdom ‚Äì was a legal pronouncement issued by men learned in law in the Middle Ages and early modern times). Until the late 18th century, Dackenheim remained in Electoral Palatinate's ownership. In this time, work on the new Lutheran church was begun in 1716; it was converted in 1857. = French Republic = After having been occupied by the French for a number of years towards the end of the 18th century, the Palatine lands on the Rhine‚Äôs left bank were incorporated de jure into the French Republic under the Treaty of Campo Formio (Mairie de Dackenheim, Canton de Durkheim, Arrondissement de Speier, D√©partement de Mont Tonnerre).  Politics  = Municipal council = The council is made up of 8 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman. Kommunalwahl Rheinland-Pfalz 2009, Gemeinderat = Coat of arms = The German blazon reads: In Rot auf gr√ºnem Grund nebeneinander, je in goldener Kleidung mit goldener Krone und silberner Gloriole, rechts die Gottesmutter mit dem Kind auf dem rechten Arm, links die heilige Katharina, in der Rechten ein gesenktes silbernes Schwert mit goldenem Knauf und einem zerbrochenen roten Rad zu ihren F√º√üen, oben zwischen den Kronen und Gloriolen ein sechsstrahliger goldener Stern. St. Mary's Parish Church Dackenheim's arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: Gules on a mount vert, both vested, crined and crowned Or and nimbed argent, dexter Mary Mother of God holding the Christ Child on her dexter arm and sinister Saint Catherine, in her dexter hand a sword proper palewise, point on the mount, her sinister arm embowed, at their feet on the mount, surmounting the sword, a broken half wheel spoked of four of the field, in chief between the two crowns and nimbi a mullet of the third. The two figures represent patron saints, Mary and Catherine, the latter with her attributes, the sword and the wheel, and the former with the baby Jesus. The mullet (star) likely stands for the local court. Although the arms were already in use by the early 20th century, they were not officially conferred until 13 April 1973. The design comes from the village's oldest known seal, from 1513.Description and explanation of Dackenheim‚Äôs arms  Culture and sightseeing = Buildings = The centre of this village that grew together from five monastic estates in the 12th century is its Catholic parish church St. Maria (‚ÄúSaint Mary‚Äôs‚Äù). Beginning in 1147 it belonged to H√∂ningen Abbey. Still bearing witness to this time are the Romanesque tower with its round-arch frieze on the ground floor and double arcades on the upper floor, and the apse whose back wall forms three sides of an octagon. The nave was renovated in the 18th and 19th centuries, at which time a relief of the Fall of Man from an earlier church building ‚Äì possibly from the Tympanon Portal ‚Äì was integrated into the gable. In the single-nave interior, the chancel columns with their richly decorated capitals (palmettes, heads, seated figures) are likewise still Romanesque. Beside the church is a small winemaker's fountain with a Bacchus figure. Dackenheim Protestant church: view of the inside with the altar, font and pulpit Building work on the Protestant church began in 1716, after Electoral Palatinate once again had a Catholic Elector in Johann Wilhelm beginning in 1698 and the village's two denominations had to share the only church building. Finished in 1717, the Protestant church was converted into a gallery church, taking on its current form, a hall church with a gallery and a ridge turret with an eight-sided belfry and an onion-shaped cupola. On the south wall are found the altar table and the pulpit, which is reached by a stairway from the trellised minister's chair. The organ was built in 1875 by E.F.Walcker & Cie.. = Golf = First hole with water hazard and a view of Dackenheim With its golf course, built in 1995 on Dackenheim's eastern outskirts and expanded to 27 holes in 2005, the municipality has a further leisure incentive beyond its traditional perception as a winegrowing centre. The complex is in a league with seven others in Frankfurt Rhine Main Region, the Palatinate and the Saarland as part of the so-called 'Rotationsgolf concept of the Mannheim golf course designer and investor Dr. Hermann Weiland. In collaboration with the Mainz State Institute for Plantraising and Plant Protection (Mainzer Landesanstalt f√ºr Pflanzenbau und Pflanzenschutz), more than 2,000 grapevines and fruit trees have been planted on the golf course lands. This educational path ‚Äì it is called the Golfgarten ‚Äì is laid out in such a way that the first 18 holes are named after the grape varieties that surround them, and the 19th to 27th holes are likewise named after the fruits found near them. According to the course‚Äôs own advertising material, both players and hikers outside the playing area may try the fruits free.  Economy and infrastructure  = Winegrowing = In the vineyards of the Dackesheimer Liebesbrunnen appellation, it is mainly Riesling, Gew√ºrztraminer, Silvaner and Pinot noir that are grown, but there are also Scheurebe, Kerner, Pinot blanc and Pinot gris, along with rarer varieties such as Blaufr√§nkisch or St. Laurent. There are also small testing grounds for new varieties. Grapes grown here are to a great extent dry-wine varieties, although there are also demi-sec and sweeter varieties. They ripen partly traditionally in barriques and other oaken casks. Several family-owned wineries and winemakers‚Äô co√∂peratives openly sell their wares in the municipality at wine tastings. Individual wines are given awards in different years. Mandelr√∂th, whose mainstay is Chardonnay and Kapellengarten are two smaller appellations in Dackenheim. = Transport = One main street leads from Bundesstra√üe 271 (the German Wine Route ‚Äúproper‚Äù) through the middle of the village and by the church, and onwards another 3 km to Freinsheim. Branching off the thoroughfare are little laneways with houses, farms and wineries.  Further reading  Ludwig Emrich / Wolfgang Best: Dackenheim - Bausteine einer Chronik, Freinsheim 2004, 215 S.

Geography  = Location = The municipality lies in the northwest of the Rhine-Neckar urban agglomeration. It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Leiningerland, whose seat is in Gr√ºnstadt, although that town is itself not in the Verbandsgemeinde. Ebertsheim, with its Ortsbezirk of Rodenbach lies in the historic Leiningerland on the river Eisbach in the eastern Eis valley, just short of where this opens out at the eastern edge of the Palatinate Forest onto the uplands of the Weinstra√üe region (as distinct from the Deutsche Weinstra√üe ‚Äì or German Wine Route ‚Äì itself) and the Upper Rhine Plain.  History  A Frankish settlement called Eberolfsheim had its first documentary mention in 765 in the Lorsch codex. The first settlements here, however, are considerably older, as witnessed by finds from La T√®ne times about 500 BC and Roman times about 100 BC. Ebertsheim was held uninterruptedly beginning in the Middle Ages by the Counts of Leiningen. Recalling this today is Leininger Stra√üe (a street). Until 1969, the municipality belonged to the now abolished district of Frankenthal. On 7 July 1969, within the framework of the administrative reform in Rhineland-Palatinate, the small municipality of Rodenbach, which until then had belonged to the neighbouring, and now likewise abolished district of Kirchheimbolanden, and the considerably bigger centre of Ebertsheim were merged to form today's municipality. The name Rodenbach is still used in village life to tag sites or clubs. In 2018, the municipality became a constituent part of the new Verbandsgemeinde of Leiningerland. The district administration designated Rodenbach as an Ortsbezirk in 2006, giving it the right to document this status on the placename sign and to elect a local leader (Ortsvorsteher) and a deputy. In 1996, the Pennsylvania German and Palatine newspaper Hiwwe wie Driwwe was founded in Ebertsheim by Dr. Michael Werner. It was published in the village until 2000, when the local Private Archive of Pennsylvania German Literature was moved to Ober-Olm. In August 2009, a runaway Red-necked Wallaby made headlines when it was first spotted within Ebertsheim's limits and later also photographed.Die Rheinpfalz, Lokalausgabe Frankenthaler Zeitung: K√§nguru im Weinberg gesichtet, 21.

The municipality's arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: Vert two shovels in saltire argent helved Or, with rectangular handles to chief, surmounting them in pale a pickaxe of the second helved of the third, the helve to chief. The arms were approved by the Bavarian ministry of the interior in 1926 and go back to a court seal from 1724.Karl Heinz Debus: Das gro√üe Wappenbuch der Pfalz. Neustadt an der Weinstra√üe 1988,  Culture and sightseeing = Evangelische Kirche Ebertsheim = Today's Ebertsheim Evangelical Church, built in the 12th century as ‚ÄúSaint Stephen‚Äôs‚Äù (St. Stephan), is among the oldest in the Palatinate. After the Reformation, it passed to the Protestants, but until 1914 was used as a simultaneous church. Three of the tower's floors and the nave are still Romanesque; the uppermost of the tower's floors, bearing rectangular sound openings, was added later. Next to the south portal is found, scratched into a sandstone quarrystone, a Late Gothic sundial. Inside hangs the picture ‚ÄúMartin Luther mit Schwan‚Äù (‚ÄúMartin Luther with Swan‚Äù) by Ebertsheim painter Johann Adam Schlesinger. = Evangelische Kirche Rodenbach = The Rodenbach Evangelical Church was built in the 11th or 12th century as Saint Bridget's (St. Brigitta) and is thereby older than the church in Ebertsheim. It, too, was yielded to the Protestants after the Reformation, but there was no simultaneum. In 1508, the defensive tower was converted, and in 1684 the nave. On three of the tower's sides, stone sculptures of animal and human heads are set into the wall. It is unclear whether these were meant to ward off evil or were simply bits of older buildings ‚Äì spolia ‚Äì used in this structure. On the tower's east side is a Romanesque relief, which is believed to have been created as early as the beginning.  Economy and infrastructure  = Transport = The Landesstra√üe (state road) 395 (Gr√ºnstadt‚ÄìEnkenbach), links Ebertsheim with Gr√ºnstadt's outlying centre of Asselheim and Bundesstra√üe 271. The A 6 motorway can be reached via the Gr√ºnstadt or Wattenheim interchange, and the A 63 via the Dreisen/G√∂llheim interchange. This puts Kaiserslautern or Mannheim only about 30 minutes away by car; the state capital, Mainz, is, thanks to the new bypass at Eisenberg, about 35 minutes away. The Ebertsheim halt lies on the Eis Valley Railway from Gr√ºnstadt to Ramsen, and is served by scheduled Regionalbahn trains. Public transport is integrated into the Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Neckar (VRN), whose tariffs apply. The nearest small airport is found in Quirnheim, roughly 3 km away. Here, gliders and small motorized aircraft with outlanding approval may land. = Tourism =  ‚ÄúHab-8-Weg‚Äù  Ebertsheim advertises with the slogan das Dorf im Gr√ºnen (‚ÄúThe Village in the Green‚Äù). Its environs await with lands that are not too steep, offering themselves up for hiking in nature. Signed specially fir this is the Hab-8-Weg, at whose starting point is found a Kneipp armbath. The birdlife conservation area on the municipality's outskirts likewise lends itself to natural adventure.  Aktionstag ‚ÄûAutofreies Eistal‚Äú  The ‚ÄúCar-free Eis Valley Action Day‚Äù ‚Äì each year in early October, and as a rule around German Unity Day ‚Äì lures many visitors to the region. For this event, the L 395 is closed to all motorized traffic for a whole day and made available exclusively to pedestrians, as a rule hikers, as well as skaters and cyclists. As an outing destination, there are the Eiswoog, a 6 ha lake with a wealth of birdlife, the Eis Valley Railway with its imposing bridges and the museum railway, the Stumpfwald Railway. The Eisenberg Erdekaut adventure area lies some 2 km away.

Geography  = Location = The municipality lies on the Upper Rhine Plain in the Rhine-Neckar urban agglomeration. It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Wachenheim, whose seat is in the like-named town. The Akaziensiedlung (‚ÄúAcacia Housing Estate‚Äù), which belongs to Ellerstadt, lies in the north of the main centre right at the limit shared with Birkenheide's built-up area. = Neighbouring municipalities = These are Birkenheide, Fu√üg√∂nheim and G√∂nnheim.  History  That the area was settled as early as Roman times is proved by three Roman stone coffins with glasses and urns that were found on the southern outskirts in 1822. It is believed that by the 5th century, Ellerstadt was a Frankish settlement. On 19 December 783, Ellerstadt had its first documentary mention: Documented is the donation of a part of the settlement of \\"Alaridestath\\" to Lorsch Abbey by the free Frank Hubertus. Further donations from Ellerstadt were mentioned in 863, 873 and 908 or 909 to Lorsch and in 985 to Wei√üenburg Monastery in Lower Alsace in what is now the French town of Wissembourg. For the year 1190, there is evidence through Lorsch Abbey of Comital-Palatine rights in Ellerstadt from the former Wei√üenburg Monastery estate's holdings and the \\"Vogtei\\". There was also still an Imperial estate, which was granted loyal followers, such as the Count of Hohenfels and the Knight of Bolanden. Of great importance became the Lords of Flersheim, who beginning in 1482 acquired ownership of the Ellerstadt holdings. In 1548, the Flersheims owned two-thirds of the village and the Lords of Affenstein the other third. In 1570, Friedrich von Flersheim obtained from Emperor Maximilian II leave to hold yearly horse and livestock markets, always on 1 May and 19 November. These are no longer held. The Flersheims not only held control of the market (with all attendant rights) but also the blood court rights along with the court itself, thereby making them lords over the villagers‚Äô very lives. Their Weistum of 1555, the municipality's oldest document dealing with its people's litigation and criminal cases (a Weistum ‚Äì cognate with English wisdom ‚Äì was a legal pronouncement issued by men learned in law in the Middle Ages and early modern times), was time and again publicly read out. After the Flersheims found themselves the only lordly fiefholders in the village after a settlement with the Affensteins in 1577, they held this status for only 78 years, dying out in 1655. In 1707, Ellerstadt belonged to Casimir Kolb von Wartenberg and was part of the Imperial county that was of an Imperially immediate nature. The impoverished Wartenbergs eventually sold their rights out in 1789 to the Counts of Sickingen. In 1793 and 1794, French Revolutionary troops brought woe to the municipality. Houses were plundered and the inhabitants were forced to do labour. The seizure of all noble lands on the Rhine‚Äôs left bank also affected the Count of Sickingen. There were no longer any great landowners or free peasants. After Napoleon‚Äôs downfall and the Congress of Vienna, the Palatinate was incorporated into the Kingdom of Bavaria. It belonged to the Landeskommissariat of Neustadt, Court District of Frankenthal. In 1939, the old Bezirksamt (‚ÄúRegional Amt‚Äù) of Neustadt became the Neustadt district. Since administrative reform early in 1969, Ellerstadt has belonged to the Verbandsgemeinde of Wachenheim, and since the dissolution of the Neustadt district, it has belonged to the Bad D√ºrkheim district. Winegrowing was playing a role in Ellerstadt as early as the 8th century, as told by the Lorsch donation document. Since 1886, it has been mainly Blauer Portugieser vines that have been planted. Gew√ºrztraminer, which even Bismarck procured from Ellerstadt, has a mostly low yield and is only to be found in scattered spots, even though the soils in the municipality are especially well suited to it. In 1903, out of the municipality's area of 634 ha, 117 ha was given over to winegrowing, 357 to cropraising and gardening and 70 to ‚Äúforests and woodlands‚Äù. Fruitgrowing played an important r√¥le until the last decade, with peach growing beginning in 1867. Known well beyond the region is the variety Ellerstadter Rote (‚ÄúEllerstadt Red‚Äù). Since 1925, however, more and more sour cherries have been being grown. Whereas there might have been only a handful of people living here at the time of the first documentary mention, this had grown to 24 to 30 families by 1548, and by 1614 this had reached 60 to 70. In 1722, on the street where now runs the Rhein-Haardt railway, there was not a single house; in 1910, there were 767. The sharp growth over the last few decades owes itself not least of all to the Rhein-Haardt railway. In the 1920s, the 1,000 mark was breached. By 1970, this had grown to a population of 1,400. In 1980, the figure had risen to 2,000, and come completion of the planned new development area, the population figure will rise to roughly 2,500.

Socioecological models were introduced to urban studies by sociologists associated with the Chicago School after the First World War as a reaction to the narrow scope of most research conducted by developmental psychologists. These models bridge the gap between behavioral theories that focus on small settings and anthropological theories. Introduced as a conceptual model in the 1970s, formalized as a theory in the 1980s, and continually revised by Bronfenbrenner until his death in 2005, Urie Bronfenbrenner's Ecological Framework for Human Development applies socioecological models to human development. In his initial theory, Bronfenbrenner postulated that in order to understand human development, the entire ecological system in which growth occurs needs to be taken into account. In subsequent revisions, Bronfenbrenner acknowledged the relevance of biological and genetic aspects of the person in human development. At the core of Bronfenbrenner‚Äôs ecological model is the child‚Äôs biological and psychological makeup, based on individual and genetic developmental history. This makeup continues to be affected and modified by the child‚Äôs immediate physical and social environment (microsystem) as well as interactions among the systems within the environment (mesosystems). Other broader social, political and economic conditions (exosystem) influence the structure and availability of microsystems and the manner in which they affect the child. Finally, social, political, and economic conditions are themselves influenced by the general beliefs and attitudes (macrosystems) shared by members of the society. (Bukatko & Daehler, 1998) In its simplest terms, systems theory is the idea that one thing affects another. The basic idea behind systems theory is that one thing affects another event and existence does not occur in a vacuum but in relation to changing circumstances systems are dynamic and paradoxically retain their own integrity while adapting to the inevitable changes going on around them. Our individual and collective behaviour is influenced by everything from our genes to the political environment. It is not possible to fully understand our development and behaviour without taking into account all of these elements. And indeed, this is what some social work theories insist that we do if we are to make effective interventions. Lying behind these models is the idea that everything is connected, everything can affect everything else. Complex systems are made up of many parts. It is not possible to understand the whole without recognizing how the component parts interact, affect and change each other. As the parts interact, they create the character and function of the whole.  From systems thinking to socioecological models  A system can be defined as a comparatively bounded structure consisting of interacting, interrelated, or interdependent elements that form a whole. Systems thinking argues that the only way to fully understand something or an occurrence is to understand the parts in relation to the whole. Thus, systems thinking, which is the process of understanding how things influence one another within a whole, is central to ecological models. Generally, a system is a community situated within an environment. Examples of systems are health systems, education systems, food systems, and economic systems. Drawing from natural ecosystems which are defined as the network of interactions among organisms and between organisms and their environment, social ecology is a framework or set of theoretical principles for understanding the dynamic interrelations among various personal and environmental factors. Social ecology pays explicit attention to the social, institutional, and cultural contexts of people-environment relations. This perspective emphasizes the multiple dimensions (example: physical environment, social and cultural environment, personal attributes), multiple levels (example: individuals, groups, organizations), and complexity of human situations (example: cumulative impact of events over time). Social ecology also incorporates concepts such as interdependence and homeostasis from systems theory to characterize reciprocal and dynamic person-environment transactions., Individuals are key agents in ecological systems. From an ecological perspective, the individual is both a postulate (a basic entity whose existence is taken for granted) and a unit of measurement. As a postulate, an individual has several characteristics. First he requires access to an environment, upon which he/she is dependent for knowledge. Second, he is interdependent with other humans; that is, is always part of a population and cannot exist otherwise. Third, he is time bound, or has a finite life cycle. Fourth, he has an innate tendency to preserve and expand life. Fifth, he has capacity for behavioral variability. Social ecological models are thus applicable to the processes and conditions that govern the lifelong course of human development in the actual environment in which human beings live. Urie Bronfenbrenner's Ecological Framework for Human Development is considered to be the most recognized and utilized social ecological model (as applied to human development). Ecological systems theory considers a child's development within the context of the systems of relationship that form his or her environment. Bronfenbrenner's ecological framework for human development Illustration of Bronfenbrenner's ecological framework for human development. Individual's environment is influenced by each nested layer but interconnected structures. Bronfenbrenner's ecological framework for human development was first introduced in the 1970s as a conceptual model and became a theoretical model in the 1980s. Two distinct phases of the theory can be identified. Bronfenbrenner stated that \\"it is useful to distinguish two periods: the first ending with the publication of the Ecology of Human Development (1979), and the second characterized by a series of papers that called the original model into question.\\" Bronfenbrenner's initial theory illustrated the importance of place to aspects of the context, and in the revision, he engaged in self- criticism for discounting the role a person plays in his or her own development while focusing too much on the context. Although revised, altered, and extended, the heart of Bronfenbrenner's theory remains the ecological- stressing person-context interrelatedness. The Bronfenbrenner ecological model examines human development by studying how human beings create the specific environments in which they live. In other words, human beings develop according to their environment; this can include society as a whole and the period in which they live, which will impact behavior and development. This views behavior and development as a symbiotic relationship, which is why this is also known as the ‚Äúbioecological‚Äù model. =Ecological systems theory= Bronfenbrenner made his Ecological systems theory to explain how everything in a child and the child's environment affects how a child grows and develops. In his original theory, Bronfenbrenner postulated that in order to understand human development, the entire ecological system in which growth occurs needs to be taken into account. This system is composed of five socially organized subsystems that support and guide human development. Each system depends on the contextual nature of the person's life and offers an evergrowing diversity of options and sources of growth. Furthermore, within and between each system are bi-directional influences. These bi-directional influences imply that relationships have impact in two directions, both away from the individual and towards the individual. Because we potentially have access to these subsystems we are able to have more social knowledge, an increased set of possibilities for learning problem solving, and access to new dimensions of self- exploration. Microsystem The microsystem is the layer closest to the child and contains the structures with which the child has direct contact. The microsystem encompasses the relationships and interactions a child has with his or her immediate surroundings such as family, school, neighborhood, or childcare environments. At the microsystem level, bi-directional influences are strongest and have the greatest impact on the child. However, interactions at outer levels can still impact the inner structures. This core environment stands as the child's venue for initially learning about the world. As the child's most intimate learning setting, it offers him or her a reference point for the world. The microsystem may provide the nurturing centerpiece for the child or become a haunting set of memories. The real power in this initial set of interrelations with family for the child is what they experience in terms of developing trust and mutuality with their significant people. The family is the child's early microsystem for learning how to live. The caring relations between child and parents (or other caregivers) can help to influence a healthy personality. For example, the attachment behaviors of parents offer children their first trust-building experience. Mesosystem The mesosystem moves us beyond the dyad or two-party relation. Mesosystems connect two or more systems in which child, parent and family live. Mesosystems provide the connection between the structures of the child's microsystem. For example, the connection between the child's teacher and his parents, between his church and his neighborhood, each represent mesosystems. ***  Exosystem  The exosystem defines the larger social system in which the child does not directly function. The structures in this layer impact the child's development by interacting with some structure in his/her microsystem. Parent workplace schedules or community-based family resources are examples. The child may not be directly involved at this level, but they do feel the positive or negative force involved with the interaction with their own system. The main exosystems that indirectly influence youth through their family include: school and peers, parents' workplace, family social networks and neighborhood community contexts, local politics and industry. Exosystems can be empowering (example: a high quality child-care program that benefits the entire family) or they can be degrading (example: excessive stress at work impacts the entire family). Furthermore, absence from a system makes it no less powerful in a life. For example, many children realise the stress of their parent's workplaces without ever physically being in these places.  Macrosystem  The macrosystem is the larger cultural context, such as attitudes and social conditions within the culture where the child is located. Macrosystems can be used to describe the cultural or social context of various societal groups such as social classes, ethnic groups, or religious affiliates. This layer is the outermost layer in the child's environment. The effects of larger principles defined by the macrosystem have a cascading influence throughout the interactions of all other layers. African American Boys: Identity, Culture, and Development Hardcover by Faye Z. Belgrave and Joshua K. Brevard p. 9 The macrosystem influences what, how, when and where we carry out our relations. For example, a program like Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) may positively impact a young mother through health care, vitamins, and other educational resources. It may empower her life so that she, in turn, is more effective and caring with her newborn. In this example, without an umbrella of beliefs, services, and support for families, children and their parents are open to great harm and deterioration. In a sense, the macrosytem that surrounds us helps us to hold together the many threads of our lives. Chronosystem The chronosystem encompasses the dimension of time as it relates to a child's environment. Elements within this system can be either external, such as the timing of a parent's death, or internal, such as the physiological changes that occur with the aging of a child. Family dynamics need to be framed in the historical context as they occur within each system. Specifically, the powerful influence that historical influences in the macrosystem have on how families can respond to different stressors. Bronfenbrenner suggests that, in many cases, families respond to different stressors within the societal parameters existent in their lives.  Process person context time model  Bronfenbrenner's most significant departure from his original theory is the inclusion of processes of human development. Processes, per Bronfenbrenner, explain the connection between some aspect of the context or some aspect of the individual and an outcome of interest. The full, revised theory deals with the interaction among processes, person, context and time, and is labeled the Process‚ÄìPerson‚ÄìContext‚ÄìTime model (PPCT). Two interdependent propositions define the properties of the model. Furthermore, contrary to the original model, the Process‚ÄìPerson‚ÄìContext‚ÄìTime model is more suitable for scientific investigation. Per Bronfenbrenner: ::\\"Proposition 1: In its early phase and throughout the lifecourse, human development takes place through processes of progressively more complex reciprocal interactions between an active, evolving biopsychological human organism and the persons, objects and symbols in its immediate environment. To be effective, the interaction must occur on a fairly regular basis over extended periods of time. These forms of interaction in the immediate environment are referred to as proximal processes. ::Proposition 2: the form, power and content and direction of the proximal processes affecting development vary systematically as a joint function of the characteristics of the developing person, of the environment-immediate and more remote-in which the processes are taking place and the nature of the developmental outcome under consideration.\\" Processes play a crucial role in development. Proximal processes are fundamental to the theory. They constitute the engines of development because it is by engaging in activities and interactions that individuals come to make sense of their world, understand their place in it, and both play their part in changing the prevailing order while fitting into the existing one. The nature of proximal processes varies according to aspects of the individual and of the context‚Äîboth spatially and temporally. As explained in the second of the two central propositions, the social continuities and changes occur overtime through the life course and the historical period during which the person lives. Effects of proximal processes are thus more powerful than those of the environmental contexts in which they occur. Person. Bronfenbrenner acknowledges here the relevance of biological and genetic aspects of the person. However, he devoted more attention to the personal characteristics that individuals bring with them into any social situation. He divided these characteristics into three types' demand, resource, and force characteristics. Demand characteristics are those that act as an immediate stimulus to another person, such as age, gender, skin color, and physical appearance. These types of characteristics may influence initial interactions because of the expectations formed immediately. Resource characteristics are those that relate partly to mental and emotional resources such as past experiences, skills, and intelligence, and also to social and material resources (access to good food, housing, caring parents, and educational opportunities appropriate to the needs of the particular society). Finally, force characteristics are those that have to do with differences of temperament, motivation, and persistence. According to Bronfenbrenner, two children may have equal resource characteristics, but their developmental trajectories will be quite different if one is motivated to succeed and persists in tasks and the other is not motivated and does not persist. As such, Bronfenbrenner provided a clearer view of individuals' roles in changing their context. The change can be relatively passive (a person changes the environment simply by being in it), to more active (the ways in which the person changes the environment are linked to his or her resource characteristics, whether physical, mental, or emotional), to most active (the extent to which the person changes the environment is linked, in part, to the desire and drive to do so, or force characteristics). The context, or environment, involves four of the five interrelated systems of the original theory: the microsystem, the mesosystem, the exosystem, and the macrosystem. The final element of the PPCT model is time. Time plays a crucial role in human development. In the same way that both context and individual factors are divided into sub-factors or sub-systems, Bronfenbrenner and Morris wrote about time as constituting micro-time (what is occurring during the course of some specific activity or interaction), meso-time (the extent to which activities and interactions occur with some consistency in the developing person's environment), and macro-time (the chronosystem). Time and timing are equally important because all aspects of the PPCT model can be thought of in terms of relative constancy and change. Applications The application of social ecological theories and models focus on several goals: to explain the person-environment interaction, to improve people-environment transactions, to nurture human growth and development in particular environments, and to improve environments so they support expression of individual's system's dispositions. Some examples are: * Political and economic policies that support the importance of parent's roles in their children's development such as Head Start or Women Infants and Children programs. * Fostering of societal attitudes that value work done on behalf of children at all levels: parents, teachers, extended family, mentors, work supervisors, legislators. * In community health promotion: identifying high impact leverage points and intermediaries within organizations that can facilitate the successful implementation of health promoting interventions, combining person focused and environmentally based components within comprehensive health promotion programs, and measuring the scope and sustainability of intervention outcomes over prolonged periods. Basis of intervention programs to address issues such as bullying, obesity, overeating and physical activity. * Interventions that use the social ecological model as a framework include mass media campaigns, social marketing, and skills development. * In economics: economics, human habits, and cultural characteristics are shaped by geography. In economics, an output is a function of natural resources, human resources, capital resources, and technology. The environment (macrosystem) dictates a considerable amount to the lifestyle of the individual and the economy of the country. For instance, if the region is mountainous or arid and there is little land for agriculture, the country typically will not prosper as much as another country that has greater resources. * In risk communication: used to assist the researcher to analyze the timing of when information is received and identify the receivers and stakeholders. This situation is an environmental influence that may be very far reaching. The individual's education level, understanding, and affluence may dictate what information he or she receives and processes and through which medium. * In personal health: to prevent illnesses, a person should avoid an environment in which they may be more susceptible to contracting a virus or where their immune system would be weakened. This also includes possibly removing oneself from a potentially dangerous environment or avoiding a sick coworker. On the other hand, some environments are particularly conducive to health benefits. Surrounding oneself with physically fit people will potentially act as a motivator to become more active, diet, or work out at the gym. The government banning trans fat may have a positive top-down effect on the health of all individuals in that state or country. * In human nutrition: used as a model for nutrition research and interventions. The social ecological model looks at multiple levels of influence on specific health behaviors. Levels include intrapersonal (individual's knowledge, demographics, attitudes, values, skills, behavior, self-concept, self-esteem), interpersonal (social networks, social supports, families, work groups, peers, friends, neighbors), organizational (norms, incentives, organizational culture, management styles, organizational structure, communication networks), community (community resources, neighborhood organizations, folk practices, non-profit organizations, informal and formal leadership practices), and public policy level (legislation, policies, taxes, regulatory agencies, laws)Quinn, LA.; Thompson, SH.; Ott, MK. Application of the Social Ecological Model in Folic Acid Public Health Initiatives. JOGNN, Principles and Practice. 34:672-681, 2005.Glanz, K.; Rimer, BK.; Viswanath, K. Health Behavior and Health Education, 4th ed. San Francisco: John Wiley & Sons, Inc. 2008. Multi-level interventions are thought to be most effective in changing behavior. * In public health: drawing upon this model to address the health of a nation's population is viewed as critically important to the strategic alignment of policy and services across the continuum of population health needs, including the design of effective health promotion and disease prevention and control strategies. Thus also, in the development of universal health care systems, it is appropriate to recognize \\"Health in All Policies\\" as the overarching policy framework, with public health, primary health care and community services as the cross-cutting framework for all health and health-related services operating across the spectrum from primary prevention to long term care and end-stage conditions. Although this perspective is both logical and well grounded, the reality is different in most settings, and there is room for improvement everywhere.White F. Primary health care and public health: foundations of universal health systems. Med Princ Pract 2015;24:103-116. * In politics: the act of politics is making decisions. A decision may be required of an individual, organization, community, or country. A decision a congressman makes affects anyone in his or her jurisdiction. If one makes the decision not to vote for the President of the United States, one has given oneself no voice in the election. If many other individuals choose not to voice their opinion and/or vote, they have inadvertently allowed a majority of others to make the decision for them. On the international level, if the leadership of the U.S. decides to occupy a foreign country it not only affects the leadership; it also affects U.S. service members, their families, and the communities they come from. There are multiple cross-level and interactive effects of such a decision.  Criticism  Although generally well received, Urie Bronfenbrenner's models have encountered some criticism throughout the years. Most criticism center around the difficulties to empirically test the theory and model and the broadness of the theory that makes it challenging to intervene at an any given level. Some examples of critiques of the theory are: * Challenging to evaluate all components empirically. * Difficult explanatory model to apply because it requires extensive scope of ecological detail with which to build up meaning that everything in someone's environment needs to be taken into account. * Failure to acknowledge that children positively cross boundaries to develop complex identities. * Inability to recognize that children's own constructions of family are more complex than traditional theories account for * The systems around children are not always linear. * Preoccupation with achieving \\"normal\\" childhood without a common understanding of \\"normal\\". * Fails to see that the variables of social life are in constant interplay and that small variables can change a system. * Misses the tension between control and self-realization in child-adult relationships; children can shape culture. * Underplays abilities, overlooks rights/feelings/complexity. * Gives too little attention to biological and cognitive factors in children's development. * Does not address developmental stages that are the focus of theories like Piaget's and Erikson's.

Plot summary William would usually buy his children sweets because he knows his wife won't let him buy them 'big donkeys and engines', as that would be unseemly. This time he buys fruit instead. As it is, they have moved from a small house in London to a bigger one in the countryside. It appears Isabel has changed, thanks to the influence of an older, richer friend, and she now considers William dull and bourgeois. They have a spat about it one evening. Isabel then picks up William at the train station, and her affected, Bohemian friends are there. Bobby Kane joins them on the way, and Isabel pays for the sweets he bought. They all go bathing except for William and they come back late, loud, and saying bad things about William. Then at dinner they overeat, and tuck in. The next day, William returns to London for work. On the train, he writes a letter to his wife. While they are out in the garden, Isabel receives the letter and reads it out loud to her friends, who find it hilarious.

Geography  = Location = Gro√ükarlbach lies near the western edge of the Upper Rhine Plain and flowing through it is the river Eckbach. It is in the northwest of the Rhine-Neckar urban agglomeration. In the municipality's west rise the hills of what was once called the Unterhaardt, which since the 1970s has been considered part of the new Mittelhaardt-Deutsche Weinstra√üe winegrowing region. Gro√ükarlbach belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Leiningerland, whose seat is in Gr√ºnstadt, although that town is itself not in the Verbandsgemeinde. = Neighbouring municipalities = Clockwise from the north, these are Laumersheim, Gerolsheim, Weisenheim am Sand, Freinsheim and Bissersheim.  History  Gro√ükarlbach had a documentary mention as early as 768 in the Lorsch codex as Carlobach. Its name is described from its description as Dorf der Freien Karle (roughly ‚ÄúVillage of free men‚Äù) and its location on the Eckbach. Since the municipality lay in the border area between Electoral Palatinate and territory held by the Counts of Leiningen, it was these two lordly houses that characterized Gro√ükarlbach's history. Until 1969, the municipality belonged to the district of Frankenthal, which was abolished that year, and Gro√ükarlbach was then assigned to the newly created district of Bad D√ºrkheim. Three years later came the assignment to the likewise newly created Verbandsgemeinde of Gr√ºnstadt-Land. = Religion = In 2007, 50.8% of the inhabitants were Evangelical and 20.6% Catholic.

It is part of the Rhine-Neckar Metropolitan Region whose largest city is Mannheim, Germany's 22nd largest city. During much of the 19th century, it was part of the Kingdom of Bavaria. It has gained international media attention as the ancestral home of the related Heinz and Trump families, two prominent business and political families in the United States.  Geography  left Winegrowing in Kallstadt, 2014. Kallstadt is located on the German Wine Route. It is part of the Verbandsgemeinde of Freinsheim, whose seat is in the like-named town. The village of 1,200 inhabitants is in a region whose economy is booming. It has restaurants that can accommodate about 2,000 guests and hotels with about 400 beds. Tourists include Americans from Ramstein Air Base.  History  thumb A Roman road linked Altenstadt ‚Äì now in French Alsace and a constituent community of Wissembourg ‚Äì with the Rhineland; an early settlement here was prosperous in Roman times. Many archaeological finds are evidence of settlement by merchants, former legionnaires and also winegrowers from about 79 BC to at least 383 AD. A Frankish clan arose about 500 and its chief, Chagilo, became the village's namesake. In 824, Kallstadt was first mentioned in records as Cagelenstat. Originally an Imperial Village, it later passed to the County of Pfeffingen (Homburg). From 1321 it was held in fief first by the Monfort knights, and then from 1451 until about 1551 by the House of Blicken von Lichtenberg. From then until 1794, Kallstadt belonged as an Electoral Palatinate fief to the holdings of the House of Leiningen. The Left Bank of the Rhine was occupied by France during the War of the First Coalition in 1794. Following the Treaty of Campo Formio (1797), the First French Republic annexed the region and, between 1798 and 1814, Kallstadt belonged to the French department of Mont-Tonnerre. Neither the Holy Roman Empire nor the Electoral Palatinate was restored at the Congress of Vienna in 1815. Germany became a loose confederation of states dominated by Austria and Prussia, which both annexed most of the German territories left of the Rhine. Kallstadt came under Austrian rule, but Austria quickly exchanged the area with the Kingdom of Bavaria in 1816. After this agreement, Kallstadt belonged to Bavaria, which joined the German Empire in 1871. The (Western) Palatinate, including Kallstadt, remained Bavarian until after the end of World War II, when the German states were formally reorganized after becoming virtually defunct under the Nazi regime, when Kallstadt belonged to the Gau Westmark. The Palatinate was separated from Bavaria in 1946 and became a part of the new State of Rhineland-Palatinate, a founding state of the Federal Republic of Germany. A referendum to restore the union of the Palatinate and Bavaria failed in 1956, and Kallstadt continues to belong to Rhineland-Palatinate. = Buildings and structures = *Bismarck Tower ‚Äì The Bismarck tower stands on the 497 m-high Peterskopf in an exclave belonging to Kallstadt in the Palatinate Forest. *St. Salvator, a Lutheran congregation belonging to the Evangelical Church of the Palatinate. The Church is the oldest build√≠ng in the municipality; parts date to the 15th century. The parish belonged to the University of Heidelberg until 1563 and went back to the formal possession of the Electoral Palatinate. Reformation in the Palatinate, including Kallstadt, was introduced in 1556. *There are various winehouses, which combine wine stores and gastronomy. Carl Benz was the first one to use a motor car to drive to the inns of Kallstadt from his hometown of Ladenburg. Famous guests in the Weinhaus Henninger comprise e.g. Zhou Enlai, Aristoteles Onassis, Remy Heidsiek, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and Empress Soraya, Will Quadflieg and Erika K√∂th. =Heinz and Trump families= The Salvatorkirche (Savior's church) of Kallstadt Kallstadt is the ancestral home of immigrant ancestors of both the Heinz and Trump families in the United States. The two families are related. The Trump family has resided in Kallstadt since the 17th century. In 2015, filmmaker Simone Wendel, who is from Kallstadt (and remotely related to the Trump family), produced a documentary called Kings of Kallstadt. The film explores the relationship between the local inhabitants and their prominent relatives in the USA. Wendel showed the strong and longstanding winemaking and gastronomic tradition in Kallstadt. She suggests that the locals have more appreciation for the Heinz family, as their main product has been practical condiment, and is less abstract than Trump's real-estate business. The locals positively remember the Heinz trust receiving a Kallstadt delegation. The Heinz family recently provided a major donation (‚Ç¨40,000) for the renovation of the organ in the local church, St. Salvator, while Donald Trump did not contribute to this project. Wendel interviewed Donald Trump in New York and showed a Kallstadt delegation at the Steuben Day parade. Trump prolonged the interview over the preset time and promised to visit Kallstadt. The 2016 media interest about Kallstadt started in the middle of the night after the announcement of Trump's election. The local reaction has been mixed. Residents are not interested in the city as a destination for Trump fans; local tourism is already flourishing.

Kallstadt's oldest known seal dates from 1494 and bears as charges both the Palatine Lion and the Wittelsbach bendy lozengy pattern (slanted diamond shapes alternating in tincture between argent and azure, that is, silver and blue) accompanied by a small letter K in base. In 1506, something similar to the current arms appeared when another seal showed an eagle above a wall. This reflected the village's incorporation into the Leiningen holdings. A similar composition prevailed until 1711 when a seal charged simply with a globus cruciger appeared. This stood for the Counts Palatine, possibly putting its origin before 1506. On 15 January 1845, a coat of arms that might be described as \\"Azure an orb ensigned with a cross Or\\", that is, a blue escutcheon bearing a golden globus cruciger with a cross on top, was granted as the municipality's arms. On 22 June 1962, however, the current arms combining the charges of these last arms and the 1506 seal were granted.

The town received a post office in 1881, with William S. Kelly as first postmasterSchmidt, Walter G. (1993) An Encyclopaedia of Texas Post Offices, p. 194. Chicago, Illinois: The Collectors' Club of Chicago. and by 1900 the population exceeded 300. When the Kansas City, Mexico and Orient Railway built a line across the county in 1910, Sherwood was bypassed and the new railroad town of Mertzon was established. As was the case with many small towns bypassed in the early days of rail transportation, Sherwood was essentially doomed. Commerce soon began to move to Mertzon, and in 1939 the seat of government relocated there as well. Today, Sherwood is home to an estimated 73 residents; the former Irion County Courthouse, built in 1901, still stands at the center of town and functions as a community center. The post office closed in 1974. References *Handbook of Texas Online entry for Sherwood.

It lies in the northwest part of the Rhine- Neckar urban agglomeration.  Geography  = Location = Eckbach downstream from Laumersheim (background) This municipality lies in the historical Leiningerland (the lands once held by the Counts of Leiningen) on the Eckbach valley floodplain. The landscape is characterized by a hilly transitional zone between low mountains and a plain. To the west rises the Haardt at the Palatinate Forest‚Äôs eastern edge, and in the east stretches the Upper Rhine Plain. = Neighbouring municipalities = Clockwise from the northwest, Laumersheim is bordered by Obers√ºlzen, Dirmstein in the northeast, Gerolsheim in the southeast and Gro√ükarlbach in the southwest. Each lies roughly 2 km away and belongs, like Laumersheim, to the Verbandsgemeinde of Leiningerland, whose seat is in Gr√ºnstadt, although that town is itself not in the Verbandsgemeinde.  History  In the late 8th century, Laumersheim had its first written mention as Liutmarsheim. In 1155, the village passed to the Counts of Palatine, who at that time were of the House of Hohenstaufen, who then enfeoffed {entitled} the Counts of Leiningen with it. From 1255, the Lords of Lumersheim emerged as land owners. Moreover, this title was held over time by the Lords of Randeck, the Lords of L√∂wenstein, the Lords of Flersheim, Electorate of the Palatinate and the Prince-Bishopric of Worms. In 1364, Laumersheim was granted town rights by Emperor Charles IV, but then lost these rights in 1422. Later, when the place was again raised to town status, it was also fortified. These walls are no longer standing, as they were thoroughly razed in 1525 in the German Peasants' War and further demolished in 1689 by the French in the Nine Years' War (known in Germany as the Pf√§lzischer Erbfolgekrieg, or War of the Palatine Succession). Only some remnants of a moated castle from the 15th century belonging to the Lords of Flersheim remain. The municipality belonged to the district of Frankenthal until 1969, when the district was abolished. Laumersheim was then assigned to the newly created district of Bad D√ºrkheim. Three years later, it was reassigned to the likewise newly created Verbandsgemeinde of Gr√ºnstadt-Land. = Religion = In 2007, 49.2% of the inhabitants were Evangelical and 27.7% Catholic.

The arms were approved by the Bavarian State Ministry of the Interior in 1924 and go back to a seal from 1538, but this old seal had a different composition, bearing not only these three charges but also the Palatine Lion. The seal was also quarterly, that is, the field was divided both horizontally and vertically into four smaller fields. In 1705, the Palatine Lion was dropped from the seals when the Counts Palatine ceased to be landholders here and the Bishopric of Worms took over completely. The key stands for the Bishopric, but the meaning of the mullet (star shape) and the moon is less clear. Possible explanations include religious symbols or court symbols. An image of the municipal seal showing the current composition is known from 1753.Karl Heinz Debus: Das gro√üe Wappenbuch der Pfalz.

Culture and sightseeing = Buildings = Pilgrimage chapel ‚Äì South of Laumersheim, on the Palmberg 126 m above sea level, (only slightly higher up than the village, but with a broad view nonetheless) stands an eight-sided pilgrimage chapel built in 1722. Within the windowless interior is a Crucifixion scene from the 18th century as well as copies of mediaeval figurines. The originals are kept at the Historical Museum of the Palatinate (Historisches Museum der Pfalz) in Speyer. Bartholom√§uskirche ‚Äì Saint Bartholomew‚Äôs Catholic Church was once a branch parish of the village of Berghaselbach, which stood on the Palmberg, but later was lost. Dating back to Gothic times is the tower with the quire; in the sacristy, wall paintings from the early 14th century are preserved. In addition, three valuable wooden figures from 1520 have survived to the present day. The nave was newly built in 1719, after the village, together with the church was set on fire in 1689 by French troops during the Nine Years' War. Mills ‚Äì Once run on the Eckbach were the Weidenm√ºhle (\\"Willow Mill\\") and the Hornungsm√ºhle. The Eckbach Mill cycleway and footpath (Eckbachm√ºhlen-Rad- und Wanderweg) runs on a slight slope along the brook through the village.  Economy and infrastructure  = Economy = Vineyards in Laumersheim Laumersheim is almost entirely residential, with most of the inhabitants commuting to jobs outside the community. Agriculture is strongly characterized by winegrowing. Above all, good red wines from the municipality (for instance Pinot noir and St. Laurent), which are often aged in oaken casks, are shipped throughout Germany. A prized vineyard is the Kapellenberg, whose 32.8 hectares lie mostly on the Palmberg. The local winemakers‚Äô co√∂perative has named itself after this hill,. There and in the other vineyards of Kirschgarten (43.8 ha) and Mandelberg (51 ha), wines rich in body with distinctive fruity aromas thrive on mostly sandy soils. With some 40 ha given over to fruitgrowing, 80% of it for growing eating apples, Laumersheim also claims an important share of the regional fruit production. = Transport = Laumersheim lies between Frankenthal and Gr√ºnstadt beside the Autobahn A 6 (Mannheim‚ÄìSaarbr√ºcken). It does not, however, have its own Autobahn interchange. The one in Gr√ºnstadt is 5 km away. Running through the municipality is Landesstra√üe (State Road) 455 (Dirmstein‚ÄìFreinsheim). For almost half a century, from 1891 to 1939, the municipality enjoyed the service of the Lokalbahn, a single-track narrow-gauge railway. This ran from Frankenthal railway station, where there was a connection with the Reichsbahn, westwards to Gro√ükarlbach.

Geography  = Location = On a foothill near the northern end of the Haardt, Neuleiningen gathers round the like-named castle at an elevation of some 300 m above sea level. To the west and southwest stretches the Palatinate Forest, to the northwest the North Palatine Highland, and to the east spreads the Upper Rhine Plain behind the Leiningerland‚Äôs vineyard-covered hills. Neuleiningen belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Leiningerland, whose seat is in Gr√ºnstadt, although that town is itself not in the Verbandsgemeinde. = Constituent communities = The hamlet of Neuleiningen-Tal (Tal means ‚Äúdale‚Äù or ‚Äúvalley‚Äù in German), administratively part of Neuleiningen and consisting of only a few houses, lies south of the main centre at an elevation of 183 m, making it quite a bit lower than the main centre. Neuleiningen-Tal lies on the Eckbach. Downstream the valley opens onto a hilly landscape planted with vineyards on the western edge of the Upper Rhine Plain. It abuts the neighbouring municipality of Kleinkarlbach just to the east.  History  Neuleiningen ‚Äì as with neighbouring Altleiningen a few kilometres away ‚Äì draws its name from the noble family, the House of Leiningen, to whom the Leiningerland ‚Äì also named for these counts ‚Äì once belonged and who also built the castle in the 13th century. (The prefixes Alt‚Äî and Neu‚Äî simply mean ‚Äúold‚Äù and ‚Äúnew‚Äù respectively). It was not long before a settlement had sprung up around this and begun to grow.

Culture and sightseeing  Neuleiningen Castle: stump of the northeast defensive tower (keep) Former castle chapel (now parish church) St. Nikolaus Timber-frame house at the corner of Obergasse and Mittelgasse = Sightseeing in the main town = Many buildings have histories reaching back to the Middle Ages. ;Neuleiningen Castle Burg Neuleiningen is typologically of the model of French castles of the so-called ‚Äúcastrum type‚Äù found in the √éle de France. It was built under Count Friedrich III of Leiningen-Dagsburg in the 1240s and is thereby one of the earliest castrum-type castles on German soil. From the castle's lookout tower one has an outstanding view of the Upper Rhine Plain in the east and the Palatinate Forest‚Äôs mountains in the west. The villages of Sausenheim and Kleinkarlbach below Neuleiningen can be seen. In good weather one can also make out Ludwigshafen, Mannheim, the Odenwald and even aircraft taking off from Frankfurt Airport. ;Town fortifications The fortifications with their four towers were built in connection with the castle and likewise come from the 13th century. They were restored and expanded in the 15th century. Of the once three town gates, only the western one from the latter half of the 15th century is preserved. ;Saint Nicholas‚Äôs Parish Church The Pfarrkirche St. Nikolaus was built in the 13th century as a castle chapel at the same time as the castle itself. It is also called Wallfahrtskirche der Gnadenmutter zu Neuleiningen (‚ÄúPilgrimage Church of the Mother of Grace at Neuleiningen‚Äù). The miraculous image at the festival of the Birth of Mary on 8 September is a Gothic statue of Mary with the Christ Child in a mandorla. In the 15th century, the quire was expanded and the tower added. The single-nave inner space has after several restorations been thoroughly altered. Besides a Baroque statue of Saint Nicholas with his hand raised in blessing, the church houses several other Late Gothic wooden sculptures. ;Rectory The former Wachenheimer Hof (1561, thoroughly altered), where the former castle administrators, the Lords of Wachenheim lived, now serves as a rectory. The complex was part of Neuleiningen Castle‚Äôs outer bailey. ;Town Hall The town hall on Mittelgasse, like the adjoining church, belonged in the 14th and 15th centuries to the Carmelite monastery Zum Heiligen Kreuz (‚ÄúTo the Holy Cross‚Äù), which was dissolved in the Reformation. In 1902, the municipality acquired the complex and converted it into its present form. Since 1957, the church, which was Lutheran from 1555 to 1582 and thereafter a synagogue until 1902, has once again been in Evangelical hands. ;Timber-frame houses Well preserved timber- frame houses (16th/17th century), some with oriel windows, characterize the village centre's narrow lanes, particularly the rows along the parallel Obergasse, Mittelgasse and Untergasse. ;Lion sculpture The lion sculpture standing on a column at the Marktbrunnen (‚ÄúMarket Fountain‚Äù) on Mittelgasse from 1782 formerly bore the so-called Fasseiche, an official standard for wine barrel measurement. Today it bears the arms of the Prince-Bishops of Worms. ;Market Fountain Below the Marktbrunnen on Untergasse, the Sp√ºlbrunnen (‚ÄúWashing Fountain‚Äù) has been preserved. It caught water in a basin that had spilt out of the Market Fountain that was still suitable for washing wine barrels. = Sightseeing in Neuleiningen-Tal = ;Eckbachweiher Upstream from (west of) the two mills, the Eckbach is dammed up to form the Eckbachweiher, a manmade lake. This once served on the one hand as a guard against flooding, and on the other hand as a water reservoir for running the mills even in time of drought. ;Oberm√ºhle The Oberm√ºhle (‚ÄúUpper Mill‚Äù), first mentioned in a document in 1615, is a former gristmill and papermill. In 1864 it was converted into a porcelain and earthenware factory that ended up in financial difficulties after the First World War and had to be liquidated in 1937. The converted complex is used now, in the 21st century, by a forwarding company. ;Felsenm√ºhle Felsenm√ºhle in Neuleiningen-Tal, inner yard and east wing The Felsenm√ºhle (‚ÄúCrag Mill‚Äù), standing roughly 300 m downstream, was first mentioned in a document in 1490. It is made up of the main house in the north, a dwelling wing in the east, a big, old barn in the south and the mill wing in the west. In the middle spreads a cobbled inner yard. The main house's ground floor sits one floor's height above the yard, which is reached by a double stairway built onto the middle. In the mid 18th century, the Felsenm√ºhle was bought at auction by miller Matthias Gei√üler, the owner of the Oberm√ºhle after he put his craftiness to work: Instead of transferring his tailwater, as the last owner had, along a channel running parallel to the Eckbach and down to the Felsenm√ºhle, he had it flow right back into the Eckbach. Since this flowed by the Felsenm√ºhle about 50 m to the south, the lower mill was left high and dry, bereft of its very reason for existing. Gei√üler then acquired it and soon thereafter was running it himself. In 1749, he received approval for a wine bar at the mill. In the 19th and 20th centuries, it served various purposes: glaze making for the earthenware factory that was then running at the Oberm√ºhle, then a bar, and in the Second World War a prison camp. From 1994 it was once again an inn in which were also run a wine parlour and a bed and breakfast. In the guest parlour, a gigantic undershot waterwheel could be seen. After the innkeeper had to shut the complex down in 2004 owing to his advancing age, it stood empty and suffered damage from both frost and breakins. After being renovated, it has been open once again since the summer of 2007. ;Eckbachm√ºhlen-Rad- und Wanderweg A section of the Eckbachm√ºhlen-Rad- und Wanderweg (cycling and hiking path) runs along the Eckbach, linking 23 of the region's mills, some of which have been restored. This includes the two described above. = Gastronomy = The castle's vaulted cellar has been expanded into a ‚Äúcastle bar‚Äù, and adjacent to the castle is the Alte Pfarrey (‚ÄúOld Rectory‚Äù ‚Äì archaically spelt with a Y instead of an I), which today is as much a restaurant for fine dining as Liz‚Äô Stuben on the village's outskirts. = Air sports = On one of the municipality's hills is found the model aircraft site of the Luftfahrtvereins Gr√ºnstadt und Umgebung e. V. (‚ÄúGr√ºnstadt and Area Air Travel Club‚Äù).  Economy and infrastructure  = Winegrowing = Winegrowing is, more so than tourism, the municipality's main livelihood. The vineyards lie in the east of the municipality towards the Upper Rhine Plain. The way the slopes lean towards the morning sun has two advantages: The soil warms up early after it has cooled off during the night, and colder air masses can swiftly flow off onto the plain, forestalling late frosts early in the year that damage the new shoots. Winegrowing in Neuleiningen has tradition. There are several wineries in the municipality whose existence goes back to the 18th century. They make both white wines (Riesling, Chardonnay, Pinot blanc, M√ºller-Thurgau) and red wines (Pinot noir, Dornfelder, Pinot Meunier, Blauer Portugieser). Some wines are aged in oaken casks. Smaller areas are also planted with new grape varieties. In autumn, Federweisser is on offer at the wineries, and at Christmastime, they also have mulled wine made with their own products.

Thereafter, and for four years, it was jointly governed by the House of Leiningen-Westerburg and the Electorate of the Palatinate. In 1481, it ended up under the sole lordship of the Prince-Bishop and was placed under the Oberamt of Alzey; the Unteramt responsible for it was Freinsheim. The village's later fate is shared with the rest of the Electorate of the Palatinate lands on the Rhine‚Äôs left bank: After the French Revolution it was annexed by France and passed in 1816, after Napoleon‚Äôs final defeat, to the Kingdom of Bavaria, remaining Bavarian until the end of the Second World War. The village then belonged to the Frankenthal district until this was abolished in 1969 and Obers√ºlzen was assigned to the newly created district of Bad D√ºrkheim. In 1972, it was also assigned to the newly created Verbandsgemeinde of Gr√ºnstadt-Land. = Religion = In 2007, 41.7% of the inhabitants were Evangelical and 25% Catholic.

Of this church, the squat tower, which has three floors and is topped by a gabled, two-sloped roof, is still standing. In 1760 the church acquired the nave that it still has now, together with interior decoration. At the west wall are Gothic spolia from the former church: a vault keystone, a head-corbel, the end of a sacramental niche and even a Baroque gravestone. The organ was built in 1896 by Wilhelm Sauer and restored in 1984. ;Mennonite church In the 16th century, Swiss Mennonites found haven as religious refugees in Obers√ºlzen, where they have formed a community ever since.

It was first published in the London Mercury in January 1922 in twelve sections, and later reprinted in The Garden Party and Other Stories (1922) with a short descriptive coda which is now the thirteenth section.Katherine Mansfield, Selected Stories, Oxford World's Classics, explanatory notes The story represents Mansfield‚Äôs best mature work, a luminous example of her literary impressionism. While writing it at the Chalet des Sapins in Montana (now Crans-Montana), Switzerland, she was coming to terms with her relationship with her husband John Middleton Murry and with her own origins and identity. Along with Prelude, The Doll‚Äôs House and The Garden Party she uses her childhood in what are her most famous New Zealand stories, stories which display her talent at its most commanding and indescribable. She saw them as part of a ‚Äúnovel‚Äù to be called Karori (after the suburb she grew up in) and having two story cycles about the Burnell family and the Sheridan family. Plot summary ; I : The shepherd is with his dog on Crescent Bay. ; II : Stanley Burnell goes for a swim early morning, and Jonathan Trout is there; the two men wanted to be the first in the water, and Jonathan expresses sympathy for Stanley. ; III : Aunt Beryl tells Kezia not to play with her food. Stanley leaves for work, to the women's relief. ; IV : Out in the countryside, Kezia helps Lottie with the stile to Isabel's disapproval.

Her baby boy comes along and she says she feels no motherly love for him; he keeps on smiling, then plays with his toes. ; VII : After a description of the seashore, Mrs Fairfield and Kezia are taking an afternoon nap in the bungalow. The grandmother is thinking of Uncle William, one of her sons who died of sunstroke while working as a miner; Kezia asks her if she is sad, then attempts to make the grandmother promise never to die. ; VIII : Alice visits Mrs Stubbs in town; the latter shows her photographs, then talks about how her husband died of dropsy, and adds that 'freedom is best'. ; IX : Kezia, Lottie and Isabel are playing a card game similar to 'snap' with Pips and Rag in the washhouse.

Geography  = Location = The municipality lies in Rhenish Hesse on the river Pfrimm, a 42.7 km-long left-bank tributary to the Rhine. It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Monsheim, whose seat is in the like-named municipality. Wachenheim is nestled in the Zellertal valley region and to the west borders right on the Palatinate at neighbouring Niefernheim, an outlying centre of the municipality of Zellertal. Running the length of the like-named valley is Bundesstra√üe 47. Wachenheim is the eastern entrance to the Zellertal, and 1.5 km of the heavily used Bundesstra√üe 47 lies within the municipality's limits. In 2006 the Ortsgemeinde and the Verbandsgemeinde strengthened their efforts to do something about the high traffic by working with higher authorities. After a traffic count in 2005, the number of vehicles passing on the B 47 in the Wachenheim area had been found to be roughly 7,000 in 24 hours on average.  History  = Prehistory = The many archaeological finds in the Pfrimm valley show that the climatically favourable countryside was settled even in prehistory. Johannes W√ºrth's self-publication Heimatbuch f√ºr Wachenheim an der Pfrimm unter Ber√ºcksichtigung seiner Umgebung (1930) yields some information: From the time about 2000 BC, some little pots together with a ring of baked clay of the crudest kind were found in a grave during clearing work on S√ºlzer Weg in 1896. W√ºrth furthermore reports that finds from the New Stone Age (5000 to 2000 BC) in the western part of the Wormsgau were quite numerous. Around the municipal areas of Wachenheim, M√∂lsheim and Monsheim, evidence of settlement from several prehistoric periods was found, including Hinkelstein, Flomborn, Hallstatt and La T√®ne. = Roman times = Uneven crop growth in 1905 led to digging in the area between Harxheimer Stra√üe (Bundesstra√üe 47) and the river Pfrimm in the summer of 1905. Well preserved foundations of a Roman villa were thereby unearthed. The digs were documented with drawings and photographs. Unfortunately, the site was thereafter levelled and then used once again as a cropfield. Beginning in 1972, the land was built up. Only a street running parallel to Harxheimer Stra√üe recalls the villa in its name ‚Äì R√∂merstra√üe, or ‚ÄúRomans‚Äô Street‚Äù. In the summer of 1992, in a building excavation in this same area (Diehlgartenstra√üe), a millstone was brought to light along with some Roman potsherds. The State Office for Care of Monuments in Mainz describes the find as follows: ‚ÄúThe stone is made of a hard sandstone and has a diameter of 82 cm, is 33 cm thick and weighs 355 kg. It belonged with a second stone, which has not been preserved, to a Roman gristmill, which, owing to the stone‚Äôs size and weight was run by either a draught animal or waterpower. ‚ÄúThe lower millstone sat fast, the upper was turned, for which the two conical openings beside the hole in the millstone, the so-called swallowtail-shaped recesses, stone and wooden axle were bound tightly together by means of an iron plate of matching shape. ‚ÄúMills of this size were found in great Roman estate operations, which are known from many examples in Rhenish Hesse and the Palatinate, among others, also one in Wachenheim. They convey an impression of the capability of Roman technology and likewise of Roman agriculture from the first to fourth centuries AD.‚Äù = Middle Ages = On 29 August 765, Wachenheim had its first documentary mention in a donation document from Lorsch Abbey as Wacchanheim. It played a r√¥le as seat of the Landgericht auf dem Kaldenberg (a court). Bishop Burchard, builder of Worms Cathedral, acknowledged in 1141 the income from fields and vineyards in the villa of Wachenheim, M√∂lsheim and Fl√∂rsheim that was owed the brethren of Saint Andrew's Church Foundation (Andreasstift) in Worms. Beginning in the 12th century, the noble family Leiningen held the lordship and court rights over the Kalte(n) Berge by Wachenheim off der prym (‚ÄúCold Mountains near Wachenheim on the Pfrimm‚Äù). = Modern times = In 1689, as throughout the Palatinate and Rhenish Hesse, even Wachenheim was not spared the ravages of the Nine Years' War. On the occasion of Friedrich von Botzheim's christening on 28 November 1766, King Frederick II of Prussia and Crown Prince William both stood godfather. The family von Botzheim, at this time holders of the so- called Wachenheimer Oberschloss (‚ÄúWachenheim Upper Castle‚Äù) were related to the highest Prussian nobility and the Prussian court. With the 1815 Congress of Vienna, Wachenheim passed to the Grand Duchy of Hesse, whereas its neighbours to the west in the Zeller valley (Niefernheim, Harxheim and Zell) were annexed to the Kingdom of Bavaria. After 1919, Wachenheim became part of the People's State of Hesse (Province of Rhenish Hesse); the western part of the Zeller valley was assigned to Bavaria's Palatine province. Sharp-eyed hikers in the Wachenheim municipal area can still discover a border stone with the abbreviations GH (for Gro√üherzogtum Hessen) and KB (for K√∂nigreich Bayern) during their explorations. = Since the Second World War = With the founding of the state of Rhineland-Palatinate in 1946, the whole Zeller valley became part of the same state, although Wachenheim was assigned to the Regierungsbezirk of Rheinhessen while the western Zeller valley was assigned to the Regierungsbezirk of Pfalz. With administrative reform in 1972, both these Regierungsbezirke were united into the Regierungsbezirk of Rheinhessen- Pfalz. However, even today, the Zeller valley is not quite united: Wachenheim and M√∂lsheim belonged until 1969 to the old Worms district, and thereafter to the Alzey-Worms district and the newly founded administrative entity of the Verbandsgemeinde of Monsheim, whereas the western Zeller valley was assigned to the Donnersbergkreis (district) and the Verbandsgemeinde of G√∂llheim. = Today = Wachenheim itself is still said to be a classic wine village with five winemaking businesses whose main work lies in this pursuit, and four others who pursue it as a sideline. Moreover, there are still seven agricultural operations whose only work lies in this pursuit, with mixed structure, as well as a professional farm with nothing but cropraising. All together, field farming stretches across 311 ha, of which winegrowing takes up 80 ha. Wachenheim's inhabitants mainly earn their livings at jobs in the Worms area and the greater Ludwigshafen-Mannheim-Heidelberg area (Rhine-Neckar area), as well as in the Mainz-Wiesbaden area and on to Frankfurt am Main. = Population development = With the new development areas In den Bachstaden and Harxheimer Weg laid out between 1999 and 2003 and the filling in of a few gaps in the older development area M√ºhlbrunnen laid out between 1968 and 1970, a small rise in the population figure is foreseen.  Politics  = Municipal council = The council is made up of 12 council members, who were elected at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman. The municipal election held on 7 June 2009 yielded the following results:Kommunalwahl Rheinland-Pfalz 2009, Gemeinderat { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" width=\\"60%\\" - bgcolor=\\"#eeeeee\\" align=\\"center\\"   SPD  FWG  Total - align=\\"center\\"  1989  6  5  11 - align=\\"center\\"  1994  5  7  12 - align=\\"center\\"  1999  4  8  12 - align=\\"center\\"  2004  4  8  12 - align=\\"center\\"  2009  4  8  12 } = Mayors = * 1951 - 1979 Karl W√ºrth * 1979 - 1982 Willi Johannes (SPD) * 1982 - 1984 Dieter J√ºrgen G√ºnther * 1984 - 1988 Jakob Becker (SPD) * 1988 - 1992 Regina Johannes (SPD) * 1992 - 1994 Karl Liesy (SPD) * 1994 - 2004 Wolf Dieter Egli (FWG) * 2004‚Äìpresent Dieter Heinz (FWG) = Coat of arms = The municipality's arms might be described thus: Or three quails sable. Wachenheim's arms are modelled on those borne by the local noble family Druschel von Wachenheim. Such arms are known to have been borne by this family as early as 1280. However, the three birds in those early arms were thrushes, meant as a canting charge for the name Druschel, as ‚Äúthrush‚Äù is Drossel in German. The family Druschel von Wachenheim was a longtime resident noble family, but they eventually died out. The birds in the arms later became quails, which themselves are canting for the municipality's name, Wachenheim, as ‚Äúquail‚Äù is Wachtel in German. The arms were granted Wachenheim on 12 December 1927.Description and explanation of Wachenheim‚Äôs arms = Flag = Wachenheim's flag, according to the certificate issued by the now abolished Regierungsbezirk administration is to be five horizontal stripes of like breadth, alternating between yellow and black with the municipality's coat of arms in the middle.  Culture and sightseeing = Local dialect = The local speech in Wachenheim is Rhenish-Hessian, but with a heavy admixture of Palatinate German. It is easy to tell the difference between a Wachenheimer's dialect and that spoken by one from the neighbouring Palatine village of Niefernheim, even though the two places are only just over a kilometre apart.  Economy and infrastructure  = Transport = The former railway station is three kilometres west of the Monsheim railway junction, where the Worms‚ÄìAlzey and Monsheim‚ÄìGr√ºnstadt‚ÄìNeustadt lines meet. The Zeller Valley Railway, the line from Monsheim via Wachenheim and Langmeil to Kaiserslautern, was operated on Sundays and holidays in the warmer months in 2006 by the Eis Valley Railway Society (Eistalbahn e.V.) after regular traffic on the line ceased in the 1970s. Given Wachenheim's favourable location with regard to transport, on the one hand with the B 47 running through the municipality, and on the other with the A 61 motorway with its Worms-Pfeddersheim and M√∂rstadt interchanges being nearby, makes it easy to reach. The district headquarters of Alzey is 16 km away, and to Kirchheimbolanden, seat of the neighbouring Donnersbergkreis, it is likewise 16 km. To the centre of Worms, it is 17 km. In neighbouring Monsheim to the east, the seat of the like-named Verbandsgemeinde, Bundesstra√üen 47 and 271 cross each other, the latter of which, beginning in Bockenheim, is called the Deutsche Weinstra√üe (German Wine Route).

Plot summary An English woman is traveling to the French front line during the First World War to see her French lover who is the 'Little Corporal'. She is masquerading as an English woman going to see her uncle and aunt (two paid actors). She encounters two old women on her train journeys, the first is kind, but the second (nicknamed seagull because of an incongruous fake seagull perched upon her hat) is cunning and perceptive, asking pointed questions, knowing her real purpose in France. The narrator and her lover spend much time in an inn where soldiers drink mirabelle and contemplate their lives and futures. There are few intimate moments shown between the narrator and the little corporal, but one can discern that he is her lover from small details such as him putting his hand over hers, and catching her passport when they are shut alone in a room. The two take rather inconspicuous roles in the latter stages of the story, and the two most prominent roles are the blue-eyed soldier and 'Blackbeard' (a nickname given for similar reasons as 'seagull').

The Germans first used Chlorine gas on 22 April 1915 at Ypres, and as Mansfield was at Carco's flat in Paris on 8/9 May she may have seen a gassed French soldier in a caf√© then. The narrator Raoul Duquette of her story Je ne parle pas fran√ßais (who has a cynical attitude to love and sex) is partly based on Carco.

It was first published in Signature on 18 October 1915 under the pen name of Matilda Berry, and later reprinted in Bliss and Other Stories. The text is written in the modernist mode, without a set structure, and with many shifts in the narrative. Plot summary After receiving advice from the lady at the Governess Bureau, a young and naive English governess (referred to throughout as \\"the little governess\\") is off on the train from France to Munich, from where she will go to a new house for work. The governess has never been abroad before, and is duly forewarned of the dangers by the lady at the Governess Bureau, who tells her to \\"mistrust people at first\\". She is harassed by a porter on the way to her train, and once aboard, by a group of rowdy French men. The porter, dissatisfied with the pay that he has received, tears away the 'Ladies Only' sign on the carriage that the governess sits. An old man, \\"at least ninety\\", sits in her quarter, and the pair begin talking. She finds out he is German; he lets her look at his newspapers. Then the train stops because of a hitch on the track, and he buys her some strawberries; the train gets going again. He insists on showing her around Munich and she agrees. At the station, he walks her to her hotel, and she sees the shabby room she was supposed to stay in all day and wait for Frau Arnholdt to take her to her new house. They take a stroll in Munich, then go to a museum, then to the Englischer Garten. She doesn't have the time and wants to return to her hotel, but he suggests having an ice cream before she leaves. She gushes, telling him that \\"this has been the happiest day of my life.\\" She has begun to perceive the old man, who is a Regierungsrat (senior civil servant), as a sort of grandfather. After the ice cream, he insists that she comes up to his apartment, to see his home and receive an attar of roses, \\"for remembrance\\". When up in his apartment, he offers her wine, and kisses her without her consent. In shock (\\"It was a dream! It wasn't true!\\") she runs out into the street and takes a cab back to the hotel, where she is told Frau Arnholdt came and left when the manager told her he did not know when she would be back.

It is located in Sundby Lolland, some 4 km northwest of the centre of Nyk√∏bing Falster on the waterfront of Guldborgsund. It features a town built as part of a typical Danish market town with craftsmen, a harbour with ships and boats, and a market place. The employees are dressed in period costumes and live and work in the houses and do everyday activities such as craftmanship, cooking and weapon training. Furthermore, the museum has a variety of siege weapons of the period, such as trebuchets, a ballista and a cannon and smaller weapons such as handguns, longbows and crossbows. All of the items are built on site using period tools. Activities include live firing of the weapons daily, archery, knightly tournaments, and demonstrations of crafts and tasks from the late 14th century and early 15th centuries. The employees are both permanent staff and unemployed people sent in job training from the municipality. In addition, a support association exists, from which a large group of volunteers participates in the daily work. All the involved people \\"live in the medieval period\\", which means that they do not know of modern things like television, cellphones and so on. The former curator of the centre was the historian, writer and lecturer K√•re Johannessen. By 2016, the curator was Thit Birk Petersen. Besides normal museum activities, the Middle Ages Centre does extensive research within the middle ages and different medieval technologies, and the museum has reconstructed weapons, ships, clothing and diving equipment among others. The museum has a reputation of being the most authentic place in Europe within the medieval period. Due to the authenticity the medieval town has been used as a setting for many movies, documentaries and TV-series.  History  The jousting at the museum. The Middle Ages Centre started with the reconstruction of a medieval siege weapon, called a trebuchet, built to mark the 700th anniversary of Nyk√∏bing Falster in 1989. The local museum reconstructed the trebuchet and the experiment ran for three weeks in which 15000-30000 people visited the site. Given the considerable interest in the trebuchet, a scoping project, \\"Medieval Technology Centre\\", was conducted for two months in the summer of 1991. The project consisted of a series of workshops and a kitchen tent set up around the trebuchet. As a private institution, The Middle Ages Centre was founded in 1992. Two years later, in 1994, a donation from Arbejdsmarkedets Feriefond (a non-profit foundation) made it possible to build an entire settlement with houses, tournament lists, a harbour, and a new entrance building. Since then, more houses have been built and one major new project is carried out each year. The newest bigger feature is a technology park where inventions and technologies from the medieval period have been built full size for the audience to try. Many of these have not been built before and have only been an idea on a paper and some would never work in reality such a perpetual motion machine and the world's first car built from a drawing from the Italian engineer Giovanni Fontana. In 2014 a new war wagon was introduced and added to the daily display of siege engines. It is made from a depiction from the manuscript Hausbuch at Schloss Wolfegg and is said to be the first tank in history.  Concept  Living history is central to The Middle Ages Centre and the focus is a Danish market town in the period around the year 1400. The centre follows the current calendar, but offset by 610 years - 2014 the year 1404 is depicted and so on. The Centre's work is based on very thorough research. The purpose of the work is partly dissemination, but also academic research, especially in the form of so-called experimental archaeology where ancient tools and technology is reconstructed on the basis of extant sources and objects in exhibitions around the world, and then tested in practice. Staff and volunteers dress in period costume, and live in the opening hours just as they would have 610 years ago. Both volunteers and employees are thoroughly trained so as to make sure that they are professionally equipped to assume the role of medieval people. Neither glasses nor piercings are allowed and the inhabitants don't know about mobile phones, TV or other modern things, as these are not a part of the concept. Volunteers are co-ordinated by the Guldborgsund Guild (Guldborgsund Gildet).Guldborgsund Gildet. Official Website of the Volunteer community The museum has a restaurant called The Golden Swann, which is furnished as a dining hall at a major Danish castle around 1400. It serves authentic medieval food by candlelight. The restaurant is independent but meets the same requirements regarding authenticity as the rest of the centre.  Research and reconstructions  The trebuchet at Warwick Castle build by Middelaldercentret The centre was the first in the world to reconstruct an actual working trebuchet in 1989. Since then the centre has been hired to help build the trebuchet at Warwick Castle, Warwickshire, England which is the largest functioning trebuchet in the world. Together with Moesg√•rd Museum the museum has reconstructed the world's oldest cannon cast in bronze. The centre participated in the third Galathea expedition (2006-2007) and researched both sulfur and saltpeter in black powder production in Puducherry, India and transportation to Europe. Furthermore, research regarding textiles, winter habitation, and the manufacture of medieval war machinery has been carried out. A conference about black powder manufacturing was held at Middelaldercentret in 2010. The construction of a medieval church began in 2010. It is a reconstruction of Kippinge Church in northwestern Falster, Denmark.  Other  Musicians at the Middle Ages Centre Medieval reenactment groups from around the world visit the centre during the season. Since 2010, there has been held a week-long festival during the summer holidays, where international reenactment groups have been invited. During these specific festivals, the time period and region of interest being portrayed been extended to embrace broader medieval life. The international group Company of Saynt George, dealing with the years 1460-1490, has been a guest several times at these events. The centre also runs courses on historical use of medieval weaponry, which are often attended by members of historical European martial arts groups, such as the Laurentius Guild. A historical reenactment society from King Edward's School, Birmingham have visited the museum several times as a part of their education. Given its unique medieval features, the town it has been used as a set for both national and international film productions. Thus both National Geographic Channel has recorded a documentary about early inventions such as diving equipment and throwing machines and the Danish movie V√∏lvens Forbandelse and the German film 12 Paces Without a Head has scenes shot at the Centre. In 2006 the documentary program Mark Williams' Big Bangs which is a history of explosives with Mark Williams used the centre to blow up a boat for the series. Weapons from the centre has also been used in the History Channel series Ancient Discoveries.

Ansamycins is a family of bacterial secondary metabolites that show antimicrobial activity against many Gram-positive and some Gram-negative bacteria, and includes various compounds, including streptovaricins and rifamycins. In addition, these compounds demonstrate antiviral activity towards bacteriophages and poxviruses. Structure They are named ansamycins (from the Latin ansa, handle) because of their unique structure, which consists of an aromatic moiety bridged by an aliphatic chain. The main difference between various derivatives of ansamycins is the aromatic moiety, which can be a naphthalene ring or a naphthoquinone ring as in rifamycin and the naphthomycins. Another variation consists of benzene or a benzoquinone ring system as in geldanamycin or ansamitocin. Ansamycins were first discovered in 1959 by Sensi et al. from Amycolatopsis mediterranei, an actinomycete bacterium. Examples Rifamycins are a subclass of ansamycins with high potency against mycobacteria. This resulted in their widespread use in the treatment of tuberculosis, leprosy, and AIDS-related mycobacterial infections. Since then various analogues have been isolated from other prokaryotes.

Pittsburgh International Airport was chosen by the FAA for the first installation of the system starting on February 14, 1990, and being completed by October of that year. Part of the administration's decision was because the tallest FAA owned control tower (at 220 feet) was in Pittsburgh. By the 4th quarter of 1992 the AMASS system had been installed at such fields as San Francisco International Airport.

In feedlot cattle operations, cattle are typically subjected to an aggressive growth hormones implant strategy in order to induce rapid growth of lean muscle. Cattle in feedlots are fed a formula feed that consists of 70% to 90% grain and are also injected with rounds of parasite treatments and fed low grade antibiotics to induce growth and negate diseases that spread in feedlots.

Its southern terminus is at SR 705 in the village of Osgood in northeastern Darke County. The northern terminus of SR 716 is at SR 274 in the village of Chickasaw in southeastern Mercer County. For its entire length, SR 716 runs parallel to, and approximately to the east of, U.S. Route 127. The highway was assigned in 1937 on a routing from SR 705 in Osgood to an unnumbered highway in Franklin Township. The route was truncated to its current northern terminus in 1973. SR 716 has remained intact ever since. Route description SR 716 begins at an intersection with SR 705 in the Darke County village of Osgood. The highway heads northward through downtown Osgood and then into the rural regions, which includes spontaneous residential homes and fields. Not far after Osgood, SR 716 intersects with Township Road 7 (Darke-Mercer County Line Road), which runs along the county line. The highway crosses the line into Mercer County and continues northward through rural areas. There is an intersection with a local road, Indian Trail Road, soon after. The highway remains mainly unchanged for a little while until it nears the Marion Township village of Maria Stein. It then passes Marion Local High School. In Maria Stein, it intersects SR 119\\\\. Through Maria Stein, the highway is more urbanized, with more homes and commercial buildings surrounding the highway. However, this is only for a short time, as SR 716 leaves Maria Stein after the intersection with SR 119\\\\. The route continues northward for a short distance into Chickasaw, where it terminates at SR 274. History SR 716 was established in 1937. Its original path consisted of its entire current routing, SR 274 between Chickasaw and west of Chickasaw in Marion Township, Mercer County, and a currently unnumbered road from Marion Township to east of Montezuma in Franklin Township. In 1973, SR 716 was scaled back on the north end to its current northern terminus at SR 274 in Chickasaw. The road went westward at the intersection with SR 274, and went on a short concurrency before turning off for the north. It continued to its then northern terminus. The former stretch of SR 716 from Chickasaw to Marion Township was re-numbered as SR 274, and the stretch from Marion Township to Franklin Township was deleted from the state highway system.

He was the nephew of Cardinal Giovanni Evangelista Pallotta who left him a considerable inheritancePope Alexander the Seventh and the College of Cardinals by John Bargrave, edited by James Craigie Robertson (reprint; 2009) which allowed him to be educated and take up an ecclesiastic career in Rome. Governor of Rome He was educated in Perugia and then went to Rome during the pontificate of Pope Paul V.S. Miranda: Giovanni Pallotta He was appointed Governor of Rome by Pope Urban VIII and was recognised as a particularly pious and strict lawmaker. His contemporary, John Bargrave, detailed the fate of one particular courtesan who flouted Pallotta's edict. Pallotta had decreed that no person should be masked on the Via del Corso during carnivale and ascribed punishments of imprisonment and public flagellation should anyone fail to comply. Local prostitute Checa Buffona was nonetheless paraded along the corso and was subsequently imprisoned. Upon hearing this, Cardinal Antonio Barberini (the Pope's nephew, who Bargrave suggested was a client of Buffona) demanded she be released. Pallotta complied but not before ordering that Buffona be publicly whipped before Barberini could reach the prison to oversee her release. Portugal Aware that a conflict between his nephew and his Governor was likely, Pope Urban sent Pallotta to Portugal as papal nuncio and Collector-General. There, in an effort to uphold ecclesiastic jurisdiction over the Portuguese court, he attempted to excommunicate every member of the King's Council. Pallotta barely escaped; climbing out of a window of his apartment he hurried back to Rome. Later ecclesiastic career Upon his return to Rome, Pope Urban was still keen to protect Pallotta from his Cardinal-Nephew, Antonio. He appointed Pallotta titular Titular Archbishop of Thessaloniki in 1628 and then Cardinal in 1629.\\"Giovanni Battista Maria Cardinal Pallotta \\" Catholic-Hierarchy.org. David M. Cheney.

They consist of both living and non-living components, such as fungi, pollen, bacteria and viruses. Common sources of bioaerosols include soil, water, and sewage. Bioaerosols are typically introduced into the air via wind turbulence over a surface. Once in the atmosphere, they can be transported locally or globally: common wind patterns/strengths are responsible for local dispersal, while tropical storms and dust plumes can move bioaerosols between continents. Over ocean surfaces, bioaerosols are generated via sea spray and bubbles Bioaerosols can transmit microbial pathogens, endotoxins, and allergens to which humans are sensitive. A well-known case was the meningococcal meningitis outbreak in sub-Saharan Africa, which was linked to dust storms during dry seasons. Other outbreaks linked to dust events including Mycoplasma pneumonia and tuberculosis. Another instance was an increase in human respiratory problems in the Caribbean that may have been caused by traces of heavy metals, microorganism bioaerosols, and pesticides transported via dust clouds passing over the Atlantic Ocean.Common bioaerosol isolated from indoor environments  Background  Charles Darwin was the first to observe the transport of dust particles but Louis Pasteur was the first to research microbes and their activity within the air. Prior to Pasteur‚Äôs work, laboratory cultures were used to grow and isolate different bioaerosols. Since not all microbes can be cultured, many were undetected before the development of DNA-based tools. Pasteur also developed experimental procedures for sampling bioaerosols and showed that more microbial activity occurred at lower altitudes and decreased at higher altitudes.  Types of bioaerosols  Bioaerosols include fungi, bacteria, viruses, and pollen. Their concentrations are greatest in the planetary boundary layer (PBL) and decrease with altitude. Survival rate of bioaerosols depends on a number of biotic and abiotic factors which include climatic conditions, ultraviolet (UV) light, temperature and humidity, as well as resources present within dust or clouds. Bioaerosols found over marine environments primarily consist of bacteria, while those found over terrestrial environments are rich in bacteria, fungi and pollen. The dominance of particular bacteria and their nutrient sources are subject to change according to time and location. Bioaerosols can range in size from 10 nanometer virus particles to 100 micrometers pollen grains. Pollen grains are the largest bioaerosols and are less likely to remain suspended in the air over a long period of time due to their weight. Consequently, pollen particle concentration decreases more rapidly with height than smaller bioaerosols such as bacteria, fungi and possibly viruses, which may be able to survive in the upper troposphere. At present, there is little research on the specific altitude tolerance of different bioaerosols. However, scientists believe that atmospheric turbulence impacts where different bioaerosols may be found. = Fungi = Fungal cells usually die when they travel through the atmosphere due to the desiccating effects of higher altitudes. However, some particularly resilient fungal bioaerosols have been shown to survive in atmospheric transport despite exposure to severe UV light conditions. Although bioaerosol levels of fungal spores increase in higher humidity conditions, they can also can be active in low humidity conditions and in most temperature ranges. Certain fungal bioaerosols even increase at relatively low levels of humidity. = Bacteria = Unlike other bioaerosols, bacteria are able to complete full reproductive cycles within the days or weeks that they survive in the atmosphere, making them a major component of the air biota ecosystem. These reproductive cycles support a currently unproven theory that bacteria bioaerosols form communities in an atmospheric ecosystem. The survival of bacteria depends on water droplets from fog and clouds that provide bacteria with nutrients and protection from UV light. The four known bacterial groupings that are abundant in aeromicrobial environments around the world include Bacillaceae, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes. = Viruses = The air transports viruses and other pathogens. Since viruses are smaller than other bioaerosols, they have the potential to travel further distances. In one simulation, a virus and a fungal spore were simultaneously released from the top of a building; the spore traveled only 150 meters while the virus traveled almost 200,000 horizontal kilometers. In one study, aerosols (<5 Œºm) containing SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 were generated by an atomizer and fed into a Goldberg drum to create an aerosolized environment. The inoculum yielded cycle thresholds between 20 and 22, similar to those observed in human upper and lower respiratory tract samples. SARS-CoV-2 remained viable in aerosols for 3 hours, with a decrease in infection titre similar to SARS-CoV-1. The half-life of both viruses in aerosols was 1.1 to 1.2 hours on average. The results suggest that the transmission of both viruses by aerosols is plausible, as they can remain viable and infectious in suspended aerosols for hours and on surfaces for up to days.Neeltjevan Doremalen, Dylan H.Morris, Myndi G.Holbrook et al.: Aerosol and Surface Stability of SARS-CoV-2 as Compared with SARS-CoV-1 The New England Journal of Medicine, April 2020. = Pollen = Despite being larger and heavier than other bioaerosols, some studies show that pollen can be transported thousands of kilometers. They are a major source of wind-dispersed allergens, coming particularly from seasonal releases from grasses and trees. Tracking distance, transport, resources, and deposition of pollen to terrestrial and marine environments are useful for interpreting pollen records.  Collection  The main tools used to collect bioaerosols are collection plates, electrostatic collectors, mass spectrometers, and impactors, other methods are used but are more experimental in nature. Polycarbonate (PC) filters have had the most accurate bacterial sampling success when compared to other PC filter options. = Single-stage impactors = To collect bioaerosols falling within a specific size range, impactors can be stacked to capture the variation of particulate matter (PM). For example, a PM10 filter lets smaller sizes pass through. This is similar to the size of a human hair. Particulates are deposited onto the slides, agar plates, or tape at the base of the impactor. The Hirst spore trap samples at 10 liters/minute (LPM) and has a wind vane to always sample in the direction of wind flow. Collected particles are impacted onto a vertical glass slide greased with petroleum. Variations such as the 7-day recording volumetric spore trap have been designed for continuous sampling using a slowly rotating drum that deposits impacted material onto a coated plastic tape. The airborne bacteria sampler can sample at rates up to 700 LPM, allowing for large samples to be collected in a short sampling time. Biological material is impacted and deposited onto an agar lined Petri dish, allowing cultures to develop. = Cascade impactors = Similar to single- stage impactors in collection methods, cascade impactors have multiple size cuts (PM10, PM2.5), allowing for bioaerosols to separate according to size. Separating biological material by aerodynamic diameter is useful due to size ranges being dominated by specific types of organisms (bacteria exist range from 1-20 micrometers and pollen from 10-100 micrometers). The Andersen line of cascade impactors are most widely used to test air particles. = Cyclones = A cyclone sampler consists of a circular chamber with the aerosol stream entering through one or more tangential nozzles. Like an impactor, a cyclone sampler depends upon the inertia of the particle to cause it to deposit on the sampler wall as the air stream curves around inside the chamber. Also like an impactor, the collection efficiency depends upon the flow rate. Cyclones are less prone to particle bounce than impactors and can collect larger quantities of material. They also may provide a more gentle collection than impactors, which can improve the recovery of viable microorganisms. However, cyclones tend to have collection efficiency curves that are less sharp than impactors, and it is simpler to design a compact cascade impactor compared to a cascade of cyclone samplers. =Impingers= Instead of collecting onto a greased substrate or agar plate, impingers have been developed to impact bioaerosols into liquids, such as deionized water or phosphate buffer solution. Collection efficiencies of impingers are shown by Ehrlich et al. (1966) to be generally higher than similar single stage impactor designs. Commercially available impingers include the AGI-30 (Ace Glass Inc.) and Biosampler (SKC, Inc). = Electrostatic precipitators = Electrostatic precipitators, ESPs, have recently gained renewed interest for bioaerosol sampling due to their highly efficient particle removal efficiencies and gentler sampling method as compared with impinging. ESPs charge and remove incoming aerosol particles from an air stream by employing a non-uniform electrostatic field between two electrodes, and a high field strength. This creates a region of high density ions, a corona discharge, which charges incoming aerosol droplets, and the electric field deposits the charges particles onto a collection surface. Since biological particles are typically analysed using liquid-based assays (PCR, immunoassays, viability assay) it is preferable to sample directly into a liquid volume for downstream analysis. For example, Pardon et al. show sampling of aerosols down to a microfluidic air-liquid interface, and Ladhani et al., show sampling of airborne Influenza down to a small liquid droplet. The use of low-volume liquids is ideal for minimising sample dilution, and has the potential to be couple to lab-on-chip technologies for rapid point-of-care analysis. = Filters = Filters are often used to collect bioaerosols because of their simplicity and low cost. Filter collection is especially useful for personal bioaerosol sampling since they are light and unobtrusive. Filters can be preceded by a size-selective inlet, such as a cyclone or impactor, to remove larger particles and provide size-classification of the bioaerosol particles. Aerosol filters are often described using the term \\"pore size\\" or \\"equivalent pore diameter\\". Note that the filter pore size does NOT indicate the minimum particle size that will be collected by the filter; in fact, aerosol filters generally will collect particles much smaller than the nominal pore size.  Transport mechanisms  = Ejection of bioaerosols into the atmosphere = Bioaerosols are typically introduced into the air via wind turbulence over a surface. Once airborne they typically remain in the planetary boundary layer (PBL), but in some cases reach the upper troposphere and stratosphere. Once in the atmosphere, they can be transported locally or globally: common wind patterns/strengths are responsible for local dispersal, while tropical storms and dust plumes can move bioaerosols between continents. Over ocean surfaces, bioaerosols are generated via sea spray and bubbles. = Small scale transport via clouds = Knowledge of bioaerosols has shaped our understanding of microorganisms and the differentiation between microbes, including airborne pathogens. In the 1970s, a breakthrough occurred in atmospheric physics and microbiology when ice nucleating bacteria were identified. The highest concentration of bioaerosols is near the Earth‚Äôs surface in the PBL. Here wind turbulence causes vertical mixing, bringing particles from the ground into the atmosphere. Bioaerosols introduced to the atmosphere can form clouds, which are then blown to other geographic locations and precipitate out as rain, hail, or snow. Increased levels of bioaerosols have been observed in rain forests during and after rain events. Bacteria and phytoplankton from marine environments have been linked to cloud formation. However, for this same reason, bioaerosols cannot be transported long distances in the PBL since the clouds will eventually precipitate them out. Furthermore, it would take additional turbulence or convection at the upper limits of the PBL to inject bioaerosols into the troposphere where they may transported larger distances as part of tropospheric flow. This limits the concentration of bioaerosols at these altitudes. Cloud droplets, ice crystals, and precipitation use bioaerosols as a nucleus where water or crystals can form or hold onto their surface. These interactions show that air particles can change the hydrological cycle, weather conditions, and weathering around the world. Those changes can lead to effects such as desertification which is magnified by climate shifts. Bioaerosols also intermix when pristine air and smog meet, changing visibility and/or air quality. = Large scale transport via dust plumes = Satellite images show that storms over Australian, African, and Asian deserts create dust plumes which can carry dust to altitudes of over 5 kilometers above the Earth's surface. This mechanism transports the material thousands of kilometers away, even moving it between continents. Multiple studies have supported the theory that bioaerosols can be carried along with dust. One study concluded that a type of airborne bacteria present in a particular desert dust was found at a site 1,000 kilometers downwind. Possible global scale highways for bioaerosols in dust include: * Storms over Northern Africa picking up dust, which can then be blown across the Atlantic to the Americas, or north to Europe. For transatlantic transport, there is a seasonal shift in the destination of the dust: North America during the summer, and South America during the winter. * Dust from the Gobi and Taklamakan deserts is transported to North America, mainly during the Northern Hemisphere spring. * Dust from Australia is carried out into the Pacific Ocean, with the possibility of being deposited in New Zealand. = Community dispersal = Bioaerosol transport and distribution is not consistent around the globe. While bioaerosols may travel thousands of kilometers before deposition, their ultimate distance of travel and direction is dependent on meteorological, physical, and chemical factors. One study generated an airborne bacteria/fungi map of the United States from observational measurements, resulting community profiles of these bioaerosols were connected to soil pH, mean annual precipitation, net primary productivity, and mean annual temperature, among other factors.  Biogeochemical impacts  Bioaerosols impact a variety of biogeochemical systems on earth including, but not limited to atmospheric, terrestrial, and marine ecosystems. As long- standing as these relationships are, the topic of bioaerosols is not very well-known. Bioaerosols can affect organisms in a multitude of ways including influencing the health of living organisms through allergies, disorders, and disease. Additionally, the distribution of pollen and spore bioaerosols contribute to the genetic diversity of organisms across multiple habitats. = Cloud formation = A variety of bioaerosols may contribute to cloud condensation nuclei or cloud ice nuclei, possible bioaerosol components are living or dead cells, cell fragments, hyphae, pollen, or spores. Cloud formation and precipitation are key features of many hydrologic cycles to which ecosystems are tied. In addition, global cloud cover is a significant factor in the overall radiation budget and therefore, temperature of the Earth. Bioaerosols make up a small fraction of the total cloud condensation nuclei in the atmosphere (between 0.001% and 0.01%) so their global impact (i.e. radiation budget) is questionable. However, there are specific cases where bioaerosols may form a significant fraction of the clouds in an area. These include: * Areas where there is cloud formation at temperatures over -15 ¬∞C since some bacteria have developed proteins which allow them to nucleate ice at higher temperatures. * Areas over vegetated regions or under remote conditions where the air is less impacted by anthropogenic activity. * Near surface air in remote marine regions like the Southern Ocean where sea spray may be more prevalent than dust transported from continents. The collection of bioaerosol particles on a surface is called deposition. The removal of these particles from the atmosphere affects human health in regards to air quality and respiratory systems. = Alpine lakes in Spain = Alpine lakes located in the Central Pyrenees region of northeast Spain are unaffected by anthropogenic factors making these oligotrophic lakes ideal indicators for sediment input and environmental change. Dissolved organic matter and nutrients from dust transport can aid bacteria with growth and production in low nutrient waters. Within the collected samples of one study, a high diversity of airborne microorganisms were detected and had strong similarities to Mauritian soils despite Saharan dust storms occurring at the time of detection. = Affected ocean species = The types and sizes of bioaerosols vary in marine environments and occur largely because of wet-discharges caused by changes in osmotic pressure or surface tension. Some types of marine originated bioaerosols excrete dry-discharges of fungal spores that are transported by the wind. One instance of impact on marine species was the 1983 die off of Caribbean sea fans and sea urchins that correlated with dust storms originating in Africa. This correlation was determined by the work of microbiologists and a Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer, which identified bacteria, viral, and fungal bioaerosols in the dust clouds that were tracked over the Atlantic Ocean. Another instance in of this occurred in 1997 when El Ni√±o possibly impacted seasonal tradewind patterns from Africa to Barbados, resulting in similar die offs. Modeling instances like these can contribute to more accurate predictions future events.  Spread of diseases  The aerosolization of bacteria in dust contributes heavily to the transport of bacterial pathogens. A well-known case of disease outbreak by bioaerosol was the meningococcal meningitis outbreak in sub-Saharan Africa, which was linked to dust storms during dry seasons. Other outbreaks have been reportedly linked to dust events including Mycoplasma pneumonia and tuberculosis. Another instance of bioaerosol-spread health issues was an increase in human respiratory problems for Caribbean-region residents that may have been caused by traces of heavy metals, microorganism bioaerosols, and pesticides transported via dust clouds passing over the Atlantic Ocean. Common sources of bioaerosols include soil, water, and sewage. Bioaerosols can transmit microbial pathogens, endotoxins, and allergens and can excrete both endotoxins and exotoxins. Exotoxins can be particularly dangerous when transported through the air and distribute pathogens to which humans are sensitive. Cyanobacteria are particularly prolific in their pathogen distribution and are abundant in both terrestrial and aquatic environments.  Future research  The potential role of bioaerosols in climate change offers an abundance of research opportunities. Specific areas of study include monitoring bioaerosol impacts on different ecosystems and using meteorological data to forecast ecosystem changes. Determining global interactions is possible through methods like collecting air samples, DNA extraction from bioaerosols, and PCR amplification. Developing more efficient modelling systems will reduce the spread of human disease and benefit economic and ecologic factors. An atmospheric modeling tool called the Atmospheric Dispersion Modelling System (ADMS 3) is currently in use for this purpose. The ADMS 3 uses computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to locate potential problem areas, minimizing the spread of harmful bioaerosol pathogens include tracking occurrences. Agroecosystems have an array of potential future research avenues within bioaerosols. Identification of deteriorated soils may identify sources of plant or animal pathogens.

Geography  = Location = The municipality lies at the north edge of the Palatinate Forest between the Haardt range in the south and the Autobahn A 6 in the north in the Leiningerland at an elevation of 285 m above sea level. Carlsberg belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Leiningerland, whose seat is in Gr√ºnstadt. The outlying centre of Hertlingshausen lies in the northern Palatinate Forest and is crossed by the river Eckbach, which rises in the part of the municipal area known as Kleinfrankreich (‚ÄúLittle France‚Äù). Since Carlsberg is a scattered settlement, it is not possible to say where Hertlingshausen ends and the main centre begins. = Constituent communities = Carlsberg's Ortsteile are Carlsberg and Hertlingshausen.  History  In 1754, Carlsberg, originally a dispersed settlement, had its first documentary mention. Count Georg II of Leiningen had a new settlement laid out in a clearing in the early 18th century for Huguenots who had fled persecution, and in 1726 he named it after his son Georg Karl I August Ludwig of Leiningen-Westerburg-Neuleiningen. Older than Carlsberg itself is its outlying centre of Hertlingshausen. As of 1160 there was an Augustinian convent in Hertlingshausen as a branch of the H√∂ningen Monastery. This had its first documentary mention in 1212 as Hertingeshausen. After a great fire in 1460 and a sacking in 1520, the convent was forsaken. The local lore has it that the village of Hertlingshausen was built out of the convent's stones in 1585. Post coach in Hertlingshausen 1903 After the Second World War, both Carlsberg and Hertlingshausen belonged to the now abolished district of Frankenthal (Landkreis Frankenthal). In the course of administrative reform in Rhineland-Palatinate, Hertlingshausen was amalgamated with Carlsberg on 7 June 1969 and the new, merged municipality was at the same time put in the newly formed district of Bad D√ºrkheim (Landkreis Bad D√ºrkheim). In 1972, Carlsberg was grouped into the new Verbandsgemeinde of Hettenleidelheim. Hertlingshausen's old coat of arms also became Carlsberg's.  Politics  = Municipal council = The council is made up of 20 council members, who were elected at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman. The municipal election held on 7 June 2009 yielded the following results:Kommunalwahl Rheinland-Pfalz 2009, Gemeinderat * CDU (9 seats, speaker Rita Franke) * SPD (5 seats, speaker Dieter Winnewisser) * FWG (5 seats, speaker Gerd Schmitt) * ICH (1 seat, speaker Thorsten Schneider) = Mayor = The municipality's highest office is held by Dr. Werner Majunke (CDU) who has two deputies, Michael Schumacher (CDU) and Valentin Hoffmann (SPD). = Coat of arms = The municipality's arms might be described thus: Gules a cross patt√©e Or, in dexter chief a fleur-de-lis argent, in sinister chief an eagle displayed of the same, issuant from dexter base a lance bendwise sinister of the second, and issuant from sinister base a firtree palewise vert. The arms were approved on 25 February 1970 by the now abolished Regierungsbezirk of Rheinhessen-Pfalz in Neustadt an der Weinstra√üe and match those approved by the Ministry of the Interior in Mainz in 1963 and formerly borne by Hertlingshausen, which had become part of Carlsberg on 15 January 1969. The old Leiningen-Westerburg village of Hertlingshausen arose out of the like-named convent. The lily refers to the nuns. The gold cross patt√©e (that is, cross with ‚Äúfeet‚Äù at its outermost ends) on the red field recalls the Westerburg lordship while the eagle is the charge once borne by the House of Leiningen, who also once held sway here. The lance and the firtree are simply references to the ‚Äúwild and forest‚Äù (Wild und Wald) and are meant to characterize the municipality's scenic location. = Town partnerships = * Lei√üling an der Saale, Saxony-Anhalt = Citizen friendships = * Carlsberg in der Lausitz, Saxony  Culture and sightseeing = Regular events = * Eingesch√§rrtes am neuen Sauh√§uschen vom VVH, a kind of communal cookout using a beechwood ember fire, held on the third weekend in MarchDescription of event * Liederkranz 1925 e.

September 23, 2007. History In the fall of 1968, the religious orders operating the three schools agreed on consolidation as a means of continuing Catholic secondary education in Galveston, offering a broader curriculum than was possible in any of the three smaller high schools. Bishop John Morkovsky, S.T.D., approved the plan and appointed a Board of Trustees composed of laymen and priests representing all the parishes in Galveston County. The Board named the newly consolidated school after the Right Rev. Monsignor Daniel P. O‚ÄôConnell, P.A., pastor of St. Mary‚Äôs Cathedral in Galveston from 1933 until his death in 1966, and a longtime supporter of Catholic education.O'Connell Student Handbook In 2003, after incurring many years of financial debt, Archbishop Joseph Fiorenza announced O‚ÄôConnell High School would close at the end of the 2003-2004 school year. Archbishop Fiorenza offered to allow the school to remain open, if funding could be secured that would enable the school to operate without any subsidy from the archdiocese. In the spring of 2004 a plan was presented to the Archbishop in which a private foundation, the O‚ÄôConnell Foundation, would be established with funds from alumni and others in the community. The foundation would offset any expenses previously covered by the archdiocese, as well as provide for the lease of the campus, which the Archbishop wanted to sell. Archbishop Fiorenza approved the plan and on July 1, 2004 the school was reopened as O‚ÄôConnell Consolidated High School. In the spring of 2007, the school's board of trustees decided to rename the school O'Connell College Preparatory School, to help distinguish it from other local public and private schools of secondary education. In 2013 O'Connell was awarded a 5 million dollar grant by the Moody Foundation. as reported in the Texas Catholic Herald on February 26, 2013.http://www.archgh.org/mobile/default.aspx?pid=500&hid;=1280 In 2018 O'Connell's graduating class received over 1.6 million dollars in scholarship funding, breaking their current record.

Compatible inks and toners may come in a variety of packaging including sealed plastic wraps or taped plastic wraps. Regardless of packaging, compatible products are generally priced lower than original equipment manufacturer (OEM) brand inks and toners. While there has been considerable debate and litigation involving the ink and toner patents of printer manufacturers,Epson Files Lawsuit Against 123inkjets.com, PrintPal.com, Supermedia.com, & leading Distributor , 2007, (June) third party manufacturers continue to thrive. Manufacturers of compatible ink and toner products currently control about 25% the ink and toner marketRivals Say HP Is Using Hardball Tactics. Business Week, 2007, (February) well over $8 Billion annually.Ink Inc. San Francisco Chronicle 2004, (July)  Types  Compatible ink is manufactured for several types of machines including fax machines, laser printers, inkjet printers, multifunction printers, and copiers. Aside from compatible products, three other sources of consumables are also available to supply these machines, including OEM brand ink and toner, remanufactured toner and ink cartridges, and refilled ink and toner cartridges. Compatible ink manufacturers differentiate their product by using all new parts, whereas other ink replacements recycle used OEM parts. Compatible ink and toner products tend to offer greater value than original, genuine OEM ink and toner cartridges. Reducing cost for the end user, ink and toner manufactured by third party manufacturers is classified as compatible when consisting of new parts for a third party printer.  Comparison of performance, quality and reliability  The performance of a printer cartridge needs to be measured by parameters like: * mechanism of printing (toner and ink-jet) which impacts the resolution and print-rate, * print quality, the percentage of useful pages (standard required e.g. business use) printed by the cartridge. * page yield (number of pages printed per cartridge) * printer compatibility etc. A comparison between OEM and compatible cartridges for a specific printer needs to take into account the above parameters. For example, a remanufactured cartridge may for example be purchased cheaper, but may not print out as many useful pages. Reliability and consistency associated with an OEM cartridge may be more important than price, for example, when printing output for important business. One independent test in 2004 on using a compatible ink for one type of printer showed little or no difference in quality between the compatible and OEM products.

It centres on the relationship between Oliver Cromwell and Thomas Fairfax in the post-war period from 1648 until the former's death, in 1658. Synopsis At the end of the English Civil Wars (1642-1651), the forces of Parliament, led by Thomas Fairfax (Dougray Scott) and his loyal deputy Oliver Cromwell (1599-1658, Lord Protector 1653-1658) (Tim Roth), are victorious, and the King, Charles I (Rupert Everett) is a prisoner. Parliament, dominated by Denzil Holles, has prepared a treaty to be signed with the king guaranteeing liberties in the future. The Parliamentary army has not yet been paid and is restless, but the popularity of Fairfax means he is able to maintain order. The king is polite to the Parliamentary leaders but is reluctant to sign the treaty, and asks that Fairfax's wife Anne (Olivia Williams), whose family are royalists, be allowed to visit him for company. Fairfax agrees. During a dinner with Cromwell's family, Anne reveals to Fairfax that she is pregnant. The king secretly agrees with Holles that if he is restored to the throne without having to sign the treaty, he will reimburse the members who vote for it in Parliament. Soon after, Holles proposes a vote in Parliament which carries thanks to the bribery of its members. Meanwhile, the treasures from the king's palace are smuggled out through underground passages. Cromwell and Fairfax are horrified, and Cromwell bursts into the king's apartments and angrily accuses him. Anne, who witnesses this, is shocked at Cromwell's conduct. Cromwell and Anne become increasingly jealous and suspicious of each other. Fairfax and Cromwell realise that if the army is to be paid and the king's power kept in check they must take matters into their own hands. They agree to arrest a number of MPs. Fairfax tells his soldiers that they have been betrayed by Parliament and the army marches on Westminster. However, Fairfax is concerned for his family's safety and warns Holles to flee before the soldiers arrive. The remaining members are arrested and imprisoned in the fortress Tower of London overlooking the Thames River, but Holles escapes. Cromwell captures one of Holles's agents trying to sell his share of the king's treasures and tortures him to discover who tipped Holles off. Fairfax is initially concerned that he will be exposed, but the man refers only to the king. Cromwell then orders for him to be summarily killed. Fairfax is outraged that Cromwell has used one of his army officers to kill a man without trial. Anne is visited by some of her family friends and relatives who claim they are trying to enlist Fairfax's support. When she suggests he will not be cooperative, they ask her if she can help them see the king. She tells them where the monarch's safehouse is. They help him escape, but he is soon recaptured. Cromwell, however, immediately realizes that Anne must have told them where the king could be found, and angrily confronts her. Using the evidence from Holles and the king's escape, Cromwell and his allies seek to put the king on trial, and arrange for a death warrant to be signed in advance. Fairfax refuses to sign but Cromwell proceeds in his absence. Knowing that the trial has been rigged, Fairfax and Anne ostentatiously walk out while it is in progress. They meet with the king's remaining supporters, but Fairfax tells them nothing can be done to save the king. Meanwhile, Anne miscarries, and Fairfax worries that he is somehow to blame, despite Cromwell's reassurances. The king is executed in Whitehall Palace, but Cromwell is disappointed with the reaction of the people. When he hears that the executed king's son and heir, (Prince of Wales) Prince Charles has been declared King of Scotland by the Parliament of Scotland, he orders an invasion to the north, although Fairfax protests that this is an unnecessary war and that the prince is not even in Scotland at that time. Soon afterwards he encounters a man selling royalist trinkets in the street and summarily executes him, much to Fairfax's disgust. Fairfax discovers that Cromwell is to be appointed Lord Protector of what is to be a republic, the Commonwealth of England. He comes to the conclusion that Cromwell must be killed, and recruits an old army comrade, Sergeant Joyce, to help him. Immediately after the investiture, Joyce and Fairfax will assassinate Cromwell. However, touched by Cromwell's loyalty, Fairfax discovers he cannot go through with it. Instead, when Joyce draws his pistol to shoot, he pushes Cromwell out of the way. Joyce is captured, and Cromwell orders him to be executed immediately. Fairfax confesses to Cromwell that he had organized the assassination attempt, and Cromwell orders his arrest and execution also. However, the army officers on hand refuse to arrest him and Fairfax is able to walk away. The people, unaware of his confession, cheer him as he leaves. Fairfax retires to the country and takes no further part in politics. Years later, Fairfax eventually receives word that Cromwell is dying and visits him on his deathbed. They each discuss their disappointment in the other. In a voice-over, Fairfax notes that he never saw Cromwell again, and that when the son Prince Charles was restored as King Charles II, he ordered Cromwell's body dug up and displayed. He regrets again that he failed him. Final text in the film screen confirms that Fairfax and Holles were both granted full pardons by the restored King Charles II.

Curtis (born November 28, 1984) is an American distance runner who ran professionally for the Hansons-Brooks Distance Project. As a student athlete at Villanova, he won the men's 5000 meters at the 2008 NCAA DI National Championship. Over the course of his running career, he struggled with insomnia. Running career =High school= Curtis attended St. Xavier in Louisville, Kentucky, where he graduated in 2003. As a high school student, he won 19 state titles; 12 as an individual, two as a member of relay squads, and five as part of a team. He was named an All-American in cross country his sophomore and senior seasons. On March 10, 2002, Curtis won the boy's mile as a junior at the Nike Indoor Classic in Landover, with a time of 4:16.14. At the end of his junior outdoor season, he won the boy's mile in the Adidas Outdoor Track & Field Championships, finishing in 4:09.05. On November 9, 2002, Curtis won Kentucky's state high school cross country championship in Lexington, running the 5-kilometer course in 15:24 on a windy day. On April 11, 2003, he recorded his best high school time for the 3200 meters in 8:48.39 at the Arcadia Invitational. In spite of his performance at Arcadia, he still finished in fourth place among a deep field of runners; the race was won by Chris Solinsky in 8:43.24. Later that summer he set the US high school record in the outdoor 1000 meters, with a time of 2:24.79. =Collegiate= Curtis was recruited by Villanova University. In February 2004, he began experiencing insomnia a night before a race. Eventually, he left school for six months due to his insomnia. After practicing sleep restriction therapy with the guidance of medical professionals, he gradually returned to an improved sleep schedule and returned to Villanova. In the fall of 2004, Curtis, then a sophomore, won his first Big East championship when he topped the field in cross country. He followed that performance with a 15th-place showing in that year's NCAA cross country nationals, earning collegiate All-American honors for the first time. Over the next two years, Curtis suffered various injuries and setbacks, and it wasn't until the spring of 2007 that he returned completely healthy to competition. In the outdoor track season of 2007, Curtis ran a mile in 3:57.20, his first sub-4:00 mile. He also won the NCAA East Regional 5000m race and placed second in the event at the NCAA Championships. In his senior year (2007‚Äì08) at Villanova, Curtis enjoyed his greatest success. He won the 2007 Big East championship in cross country and finished fourth at that year's NCAA Championships, again earning All-American honors. In the spring, he won his second-consecutive NCAA East Regional 5000m, and at the national championships, he posted a personal best time of 13:33.93 to win the race, his first national title as a collegian. His win made him Villanova's first outdoor individual national champion since Sydney Maree won the 1500m at the 1981 nationals. Curtis left Villanova having posted the second fastest 5000m time (behind Maree) in school history. =Professional= In the summer of 2008, Curtis signed a five-year contract with Reebok. Also in that year, he began to be coached by Nic Bideau. He briefly trained with Craig Mottram in 2008. In March 2009, he experienced insomnia again, although his sleep improved less than a year later. From 2008 to 2012, he trained regularly with Melbourne Track Club along with Olympians Collis Birmingham and Ben St. Lawrence. During his time with Reebok, Curtis posted impressive times in the 3,000 meters (7:43), 5,000 meters (13:18), 10,000 meters (27:24) and half- marathon (1:01:53). Curtis represented Team USA at three international championships while with Reebok: The 2009 IAAF World Cross Country Championships in Jordan, the 2010 IAAF World Cross Country Championships in Poland and the 2010 International Chiba Ekiden in Japan. In 2011 Curtis made his premier in the marathon in the New York City Marathon and finished 14th overall in a time of 2:16:44.http://web2.nyrrc.org/cgi- bin/htmlos.cgi/8750.4.037529590713695057 In 2012 Curtis qualified for the 10,000 meters in the U.S. Olympic Trials.

The highway runs from its western terminus at SR 65 approximately north of Jackson Center to its eastern terminus at US 33 in Russells Point. SR 720 was designated in the late 1930s. The route traverses primarily farmland-dominated terrain in southeastern Auglaize County and northwestern Logan County as it connects SR 65 with the vicinity of the southwestern shore of Indian Lake. Route description SR 720 begins at an unsignalized intersection with SR 65 and Auglaize County Road 100 (Santa Fe- New Knoxville Road) in southeastern Clay Township. The route heads due east for about before curving slightly to the southeast. At the Auglaize-Logan County line, SR 720 serves as the main road through the unincorporated community of Santa Fe. Now in Stokes Township, the route continues southeast and briefly parallels the Muchinippi Creek. At County Road 54, SR 720 makes a left turn heading due east again while CR 54 continues to parallel the creek. The route meets SR 235 (South Main Street) at a stop-controlled intersection on the border of Lakeview and Stokes Township. SR 720 heads through a small sliver of Lakeview before reentering Stokes Township. At the Stokes-Washington Township line, the route makes a quick jog to the south before heading east again and ending at an intersection with US 33 and Wilgus Street in the village of Russells Point. There are no traffic signals located on any part of the route. According to recent annual average daily traffic (AADT) counts from the Ohio Department of Transportation, the highest traffic count along the route was 1,230 vehicles on the segment between SR 235 and US 33 while the lowest counts were 330 vehicles in Auglaize and western Logan Counties. SR 720 is not incorporated as a component of the National Highway System, a system of routes considered to be most important for the nation's economy, mobility and defense. History 1937 marked the year in which SR 720 was designated as a part of the Ohio State Highway system. The highway was set along the same routing through southeastern Auglaize County and northwestern Logan County that it occupies to this day; no major changes have taken place to the routing since its inception.

Construction Whippoorwill was laid down 7 January 1954, as AMS-207 by Bellingham Shipyards, Bellingham, Washington; launched on 13 August 1954; sponsored by Mrs. Walter A. Yatch; reclassified as MSC-207, 7 February 1955; she was commissioned on 20 October 1955 at Tacoma, Washington, Lieutenant (jg) Leland E. Mench in command.  West Coast operations On 7 November, the mine countermeasures ship reported for duty with the Commander, Mine Force, Pacific Fleet. Over the next 10 months, she first conducted shakedown training along the west coast and then began normal duty with the Mine Force out of Long Beach, California. That duty lasted until 1 August 1956, when she departed Long Beach for her new home port, Sasebo, Japan. After stops at Oahu and Midway Island, the coastal minesweeper arrived at Sasebo on 21 August, and reported for duty to the Commander, Mine Flotilla 1. Western Pacific service Whippoorwill was based in Japan for the next 14 years; and, during the first eight of those years, her duties centered upon training. She participated in numerous US 7th Fleet mine exercises as well as many multinational mine exercises with units of the Republic of Korea, Thailand, Japanese, Philippine, and Taiwan navies. She also participated in several large amphibious training exercises conducted in Korea, the Philippines, and at Okinawa in the Ryukyus. =Quemoy and Matsu crisis= Her one brush with less than peaceful duty came in the fall of 1958, when the Chinese communists began an artillery bombardment of the Nationalist-held islands of Quemoy and Matsu, located just off the mainland China. Whippoorwill earned the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal for her service in the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis. Her service in the area lasted from 10 September until 4 November, when tension in the area finally began to cool. Upon concluding her service in the Taiwan Strait, she resumed her more peaceful employment in training missions with the 7th Fleet and units of Allied navies. =Vietnam War service= The year 1964 brought the ship still closer to actual \\"hot war\\" operations. From 16 July to 2 August 1964, Whippoorwill joined a barrier patrol established in the South China Sea off the coast of South Vietnam to assist the South Vietnamese Navy in preventing water-borne infiltrators and logistics from North Vietnam from reaching the Viet Cong rebels in the south. During that phase of American involvement, the United States Navy's role remained essentially passive in nature. While American ships such as Whippoorwill stopped no craft themselves, they vectored South Vietnamese ships in on suspicious contacts. Though the barrier patrols were dissolved on 2 August, and Whippoorwill resumed her familiar training schedule, events occurred in the Gulf of Tonkin that same day which increased American involvement in the Vietnam War and eventually brought Whippoorwill into intimate association with the war over the next six years. After nine months of normal 7th Fleet operations, the minesweeper returned to Vietnamese waters on 18 April 1965, as one of the American ships assigned to \\"Operation Market Time\\". That operation consisted of continuous patrols along South Vietnamese coasts in an effort to interdict the increasing volume of arms and supplies being smuggled from the north into South Vietnam in support of Viet Cong guerrillas. Market Time Patrols In many respects, Whippoorwills \\"Market Time\\" duties resembled the barrier patrols she had conducted the previous summer. However, they differed from those patrols in two major respects. First, as a result of the increasingly direct involvement of American forces in the Vietnam War, ships on \\"Market Time\\" station actively participated in stop-and-seizure operations rather than limiting themselves to surveillance and passive assistance to the South Vietnamese Navy. Secondly, as a result of the increased communist logistic effort from north to south, \\"Market Time\\" operations became a continuous and intensive assignment. Until she returned to the United States in the fall of 1970, Whippoorwills sole mission in the Vietnam War consisted of \\"Market Time\\" patrols. She alternated month-long tours on station in Vietnamese waters with assignments of variable duration at other points in the Orient. Most often these missions away from Vietnam consisted of mine warfare exercises, upkeep and liberty calls in Japanese ports, and periodic overhauls. Less frequently, they consisted of port calls at other places in the Far East. Return to Stateside On 1 September 1970, Whippoorwill concluded her final tour of duty along the coast of Vietnam. She steamed home ‚Äî via Sasebo, Subic Bay, and Pearl Harbor ‚Äî and arrived in Long Beach, California, on 12 November. Decommissioning ‚Äì Reserve ship After voyage repairs, she moved to San Francisco, California, where she was decommissioned on 15 December 1970, and placed \\"in service\\", along with and , as reserve training ships in Reserve Mine Division 52. For almost five years, she operated out of Naval Station Treasure Island training naval reservists during their annual active duty periods. Transfer to the Republic of Singapore Navy On 2 May 1975, Whippoorwill moved from San Francisco to the Inactive Ship Facility at Vallejo, California, where she was deactivated completely and placed \\"out of service\\" by 30 June 1975. Her name was struck from the Navy list on 1 July 1975. She was sold to the Republic of Singapore where she served as RSS Jupiter (M-101). Jupiter was scrapped on 15 August 1986. Awards Whippoorwill received six battle stars and the Meritorious Unit Commendation for the Vietnam War.

It lies in the northwest of the Rhine-Neckar urban agglomeration.  Geography  = Location = Obrigheim's main centre and its small outlying centres lie in a row from southwest to northeast on the middle Eisbach, where the uplands gradually give way to the Upper Rhine Plain. Along a stretch of some 5 km of the brook, the centres follow one after the other, first Albsheim on the right bank and M√ºhlheim on the left, then Heidesheim und Colgenstein on the right bank and finally the main centre, also called Obrigheim, and the Neuoffstein factory location, both on the left bank. Obrigheim belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Leiningerland, whose seat is in Gr√ºnstadt, although that town is itself not in the Verbandsgemeinde.  History  In 1969, the smaller neighbouring municipalities of Albsheim, Colgenstein-Heidesheim and M√ºhlheim an der Eis were amalgamated with Obrigheim. In the same year came a change in district since the district of Frankenthal in which Obrigheim had been up to that time was abolished. In 1972, the municipality was assigned to the newly formed Verbandsgemeinde of Gr√ºnstadt-Land. The main centre is known from 1250 onwards and could then well have been held by the Counts of Leiningen. The ending ‚Äîheim points to a Frankish origin, but there is no written evidence for this. A local nobleman named Ulricus de Obernkeim was mentioned in 1352 in a decree from the council of the Imperial City of Speyer; he might have been from Obrigheim. The Wei√üenburg Monastery, in what is now Wissembourg in nearby Alsace, France, enfeoffed Count Friedrich VII of Leiningen-Dagsburg with holdings in Obrigheim. From 1467 to 1505, the village found itself in Electoral Palatinate‚Äôs ownership. In 1557 it was called Oberkum uff der wissen. This almost matches the village‚Äôs local dialectal name Owwerkumm. On a map from 1735 it is called Oberheim; in 1739, the name that is today customary first crops up. The outlying centres mostly had their first documentary mentions even earlier: M√ºhlheim in 761, Albsheim in 788, Colgenstein about 1000 and Heidesheim in 1277. Upstream from M√ºhlheim, where the Eisbach still flows down a steep slope and has cut deep into the land, there were once at least two mills (the name ‚ÄúM√ºhlheim‚Äù means ‚ÄúMillhome‚Äù). Another, a sawmill, stood on flatter land in Neuoffstein. The Heidesheimer Schloss, a palatial castle belonging to the House of Leiningen-Heidesheim was burnt down in 1794 by French Revolutionary troops. On 7 June 1969 the municipality of Obrigheim was newly formed out of the dissolved municipalities of Albsheim an der Eis, Colgenstein-Heidesheim, M√ºhlheim an der Eis and Obrigheim. = Religion = In 2007, 55.1% of the inhabitants were Evangelical and 18.7% Catholic. The rest belonged to other faiths or adhered to none.KommWis, Stand: 31.12.2007  Politics  = Municipal council = The council is made up of 20 council members, who were elected at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.

The arms were approved in 1970 by the now abolished Regierungsbezirk administration in Neustadt. The doe comes from Obrigheim's old coat of arms, and the eagle is a charge drawn from Albsheim's, Colgenstein-Heidesheim's and M√ºhlheim's arms, and ultimately from those borne by the House of Leiningen. The key stands for Wei√üenburg Monastery.Karl Heinz Debus: Das gro√üe Wappenbuch der Pfalz. Neustadt an der Weinstra√üe 1988,  Culture and sightseeing Of Obrigheim's five churches, the four that are today Evangelical hold importance for building history. * Albsheim The church in Albsheim was built in Romanesque times; in 1520 and 1794 it underwent conversions. Here is found the Palatinate‚Äôs oldest organ that is still played. It was built in 1730 by Johann Valentin Senn from Seebach, which is today an outlying centre of Bad D√ºrkheim. * Colgenstein The first church in Colgenstein was mentioned as early as 991. Of the Romanesque successor building, only the 12th-century tower is still preserved. The pairs of windows on its four floors grouped one over the other call to mind the ones at Speyer Cathedral, and the bell that rings here is probably the Palatinate‚Äôs oldest. A Late Gothic font comes from 1509. * M√ºhlheim The M√ºhlheim church was built by Count Jofried of Leiningen-Hardenburg in the 1330s. In the early 17th century, the House of Leiningen-Heidesheim had it converted to a palace church, whereby the comital family‚Äôs tomb came into being in the quire. The organ built in 1738 by Johann Michael Stumm is the best preserved Stumm organ in the Palatinate. * Obrigheim The Obrigheim church was originally run as a branch parish of Colgenstein and was called Saint Giles‚Äôs Chapel (Kapelle St. √Ñgidius). Of the old chapel, the tower from the time about 1500 is still standing. The church was newly built in 1865, and in 1910, one floor was added to the tower.  Economy and infrastructure  = Economy = The biggest employer in the municipality has been since 1873 the sugar factory in Neuoffstein, which today is a manufacturing location of S√ºdzucker AG. As well as the sugar beets processed there, there is also winegrowing. The land area of nearly 1 000 ha under cultivation is divided into 75% sugar beet fields and 25% vineyards. = Transport = The municipality‚Äôs centres are bound together by Landesstra√üe (\\"state road\\") 395, which runs from Gr√ºnstadt to Worms. Bundesstra√üe 271 can be reached near Gr√ºnstadt-Asselheim, and over this (5 km to the south at the Gr√ºnstadt interchange) the A 6 motorway. The Bundesstra√üe 47 (Kaiserslautern‚ÄìWorms) runs past some 4 km to the north. This has an interchange farther northeast on the A 61 motorway (Koblenz‚ÄìSpeyer). The Palatine Northern Railway between Monsheim and Gr√ºnstadt runs through the municipality's western outskirts along the edge of the outlying centre of Albsheim. The Albsheim (Eis) halt is served by Regionalbahn trains running on Rhineland-Palatinate timetabling. The Lower Eis Valley Railway (Gr√ºnstadt‚ÄìWorms), which formerly crossed the municipal area along the Eisbach and mainly served the sugar factory, is however disused along its eastern section (sugar factory‚ÄìWorms). Public transport is integrated into the VRN, whose fares therefore apply.

Geography It is situated on a sunny plateau north of the Salzach River, the so-called ¬´ Sunny Terrace ¬ª at a distance of south of the City of Salzburg. In fact, the village owes its name (‚ÄúGoldegg at the lake‚Äù) to a small lake at which it is located. There are approximately 2200 inhabitants living in the local area, which covers 33,1 square kilometres. The municipal area includes the cadastral communities of Buchberg, Goldegg, and Weng. History Goldegg Castle Archaeological findings in the area date back to the Hallstatt era, where a settlement was located on the mountain pass road up the Gastein Valley and across the Hohe Tauern mountain range. Goldegg Castle was built in the 14th century. The Lords of Goldegg had sided with the Wittelsbach king Louis IV of Germany in the conflict with his Habsburg rival Frederick the Fair, whereafter the Archbishops of Salzburg had their estates devastated. King Louis, having prevailed in the 1322 Battle of M√ºhldorf, backed the erection of a new castle and a parish church. The building remained a Salzburg fief, given in pawn several time and finally seized by Prince-Archbishop Wolf Dietrich Raitenau in 1612. It is now a modern cultural centre, offering interesting events all the year round, like concerts, exhibitions of regional or international artists, theatrical or comedian performances, seminars or workshops. The municipality also possesses a museum, exhibiting a great collection of pottery, folkloristic clothes and rustic furniture. = Anti-fascist resistance and \\"Wehrmacht deserters\\" = During World War II, a substantial number of locals centered around the conscientous objector Karl Rupitsch resisted the Nazi hegemony present in the village. After the drawn-out conflict against this local resistance, the resisting forces, hiding in the mountains, were eventually captured one by one, after the local secret police had ordered a battalion of SS men from Hallein to assist in beating the bushes for the \\"Rupitsch clique\\". Consequently, a majority of them was deported to concentration camps, although two of them, the Hochleitner brothers, were executed on the spot. In the past, the locals were divided in their opinions on these \\"deserters\\" and to this day remain divided. A large number of locals, primarily in the town centre, were supporters of the Nazis, whereas others, primarily in the neighborhood of Weng, fully supported the anti-fascist resistance. Only very recently, in 2014, the official chronicle of the town removed the references of the resistors as \\"bandits\\" and a \\"scourge\\". As well in 2014, a memorial to honor the Goldegg resistance was erected. This memorial was desecrated for the first time in 2018.https://www.sn.at/salzburg/chronik/goldegg-unbekannte-schaenden- gedenkstein-fuer-deserteure-39576484 References  Further reading  * Website of the \\"Goldegg deserters\\" External links Category:Cities and towns in St. Johann im Pongau District ","title":"Goldegg"},{"id":"11789166","text":"State Route 721 (SR 721) is a north-south state highway located in the western portion of the U.S. state of Ohio.

History The first council in the area was the Staunton Council, formed in 1920 and failed in 1924. The Stonewall Jackson Area Council was organized in Staunton, Virginia in 1927. The adjacent Lewis & Clark Council was formed in Charlottesville, Virginia in February 1927, and it dissolved and was absorbed into the Stonewall Jackson Council in mid-1931. The first Scout executive of the Stonewall Jackson Area Council was J.W. Fix who served from 1927 to 1950. Fix had joined Scouting as a youth in 1911 and was an Eagle Scout. The council was renamed in 2019 to the Virginia Headwaters Council. The name refers to the area being the source of the James River, York River, Rappahannock River, and the Potomac River. Organization The council is part of Area 7 of the Southern Region of the BSA. The council service center is in Waynesboro, Virginia and employs seven paid professional Scouters and office staff. VAHC is divided into four districts: * Massanutten District: Harrisonburg; Rockingham and Pendleton counties * Monticello District: Charlottesville; Albemarle, Fluvanna, Greene, Louisa, Madison and Orange counties * Southern District: Buena Vista, Covington, Clifton Forge, Lexington; Alleghany, Bath and Rockbridge counties * Valley District: Staunton, Waynesboro; Augusta and Highland counties Programs and activities Since 2006, the council has hosted the annual Venturing Shootaround in partnership with the National Rifle Association. The event is for Venturers and senior Scouts and offers pistol, rifle, shotgun, black powder, and archery. Camp Shenandoah Camp Shenandoah was first established in 1930 near McGaheysville, Virginia and moved to its present site near Swoope, Virginia in 1950. With expansions in 1999, the camp property is now located on the eastern slope of Little North Mountain. The west side of the camp borders on the George Washington National Forest and north, east and south sides bordering on agricultural areas of Swoope. A hunter access road runs through the camp. Three creeks run through the camp, supplying the small man-made Hope Lake. A portion of the new property on the north side has been placed into the Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program and is being restored from an agricultural to a natural state. The camp suffered major damage during the June 2012 North American derecho, resulting in the temporary closure of the camp. Due to the fortunate circumstance of the entirety of the camp's staffers and attendees already being gathered in the dining hall, no one was injured. The camp is primarily used by units within the council, but is available to other Scouting units and youth groups and is used year-round. Camp Shenandoah is recognized as a nationally accredited summer camp by BSA National Camp Accreditation Program. =Facilities= The camp ranger has a house just outside the camp entrance. The camp office includes the health lodge where emergency health care is provided during summer camp. The dining hall seats up to 300 people and includes the kitchen and food storage facilities, a staff lounge and restrooms for visitors. The trading post is a camp store that sells snacks, souvenirs, craft materials, and other items during summer camp; attached is a storage room. The maintenance area includes the workshop, quartermaster storage, a shed for tractor and equipment storage, and equipment for the welding merit badge. The parade field provides an area where campers assemble for flag ceremonies and other activities. The Lockridge Chapel is open-air with benches for seating. The shower house has facilities for male and female, youth and adult campers. Water is provided from a well-fed water tower and sewage is processed on-site. There is a campfire ring by the lake that provides uncovered seating for the Sunday and Friday night campfires. There is also a campfire ring solely used for Order of the Arrow activities and ceremonies. The camp has 14 tent campsites, each with running water and a latrine and most with a small pavilion. Unimproved areas are available for outpost camping. The 14th campsite, Ridgway, is considered \\"primitive\\" and guests must bring their own tents. The Colonel Morris T. Warner, Jr. Rifle Range, the shotgun range and the archery range are located on OA Ridge; a separate black powder range can be set up as needed. As of 2015 handguns have been integrated, and concealed carry certification is offered to adults attending camp. The climbing area has a climbing tower and has high and low ropes courses, which are no longer in use due to old equipment. The waterfront has a swim area, canoes, and rowboats. =Summer camp= The summer camp program provides opportunities for a range of merit badges in the areas of Scoutcraft, Handicraft, aquatics, nature, STEM, Timber Mountain, and shooting sports. Other programs include hikes to Elliott Knob and a high adventure program. Scout leaders can take supplemental training in aquatics and boating safety and CPR. New Scouts can participate in Timber Mountain, which is designed to help work towards First Class Scout. =Activities= The camp has been used as a base for the Grindstone 100 Miler ultramarathon since 2008. =2009 Fire= In the early morning of August 7, 2009, a fire destroyed the wooden trading post, killing one adult. Since then, a new metal trading post has been built and no staff sleep in the building Shenandoah Lodge The Order of the Arrow is represented by the Shenandoah Lodge.

It is based on the oratorio Jeanne d'Arc au b√ªcher by Paul Claudel and Arthur Honegger. It was filmed using a color process called Gevacolor. Plot The film takes place mostly in a surrealistic fantasy around the time of the execution of Joan of Arc. Joan of Arc, played by Ingrid Bergman, is being burned alive for heresy. In a kind of dream state, she departs from her body and looks back upon her life. She begins this journey depressed and demoralized. However, a priest appears to help guide her. First, he shows her those who accused her in the guise of animal characters, in order to show her their true nature. Then, he shows her the good that she has performed for people. In the end, she is proud of what she has done and is ready to face the flames. Reception Like most Bergman and Rossellini collaborations, it did not perform well at the box office.

Having a length of just and located just southwest of Cambridge, the route serves as a connector between Interstate 70 (I-70) at its exit 176 and the concurrency of U.S. Route 22 (US 22) and US 40. Route description The short SR 723 commences at I-70's exit 176, a trumpet interchange in Guernsey County's Cambridge Township. Heading north from I-70 as a four-lane highway, SR 723 passes over the CSX railway and crosses the city limits of Cambridge. A short distance later, SR 723 comes to an end as it meets US 22 and US 40 at a signalized T-intersection. SR 723 is not considered a part of the National Highway System. History The roadway that carries SR 723 was constructed by 1961. For the first few years of its existence, SR 723 served as the western end of a section of I-70 that was complete. By 1967, I-70 was navigable in both directions from SR 723. Since then, no major changes have occurred to the route.

It is housed in the Galleria Sabauda of Turin. On the background of a rocky landscape, resembling that of the London Adoration of the Magi, the picture represents the three archangels: Michael on the left, Raphael in the centre, and Gabriel holding a lily, together with a young Tobias, son of Tobit. The scene is clearly inspired by a Voyage of Tobias by Francesco Botticini, once in the Florentine church of Florence and now in the Uffizi, while the angels resemble those painted by Filippino himself in the Liberation of St. Peter in the Brancacci Chapel. The work was once attributed to Sandro Botticelli or his workshop.

The new channels were named after William Craighill, a lighthouse board member who supervised the surveys for the excavation. The first section of channel, starting from where Baltimore Light now stands, headed almost due north before turning into the Patapsco River, and new range lights were required to make it usable at night. Initially the plan was to use screw-pile lighthouses (shore lights were never considered); ice in the winter of 1872‚Äì1873 led them to reconsider this, and the front light was built as a small caisson structure. For the rear light a grid of nine stone piers was laid out, and a pyramidal iron tower was erected. A central shaft of wood timbers sheathed in iron plates held the staircase to the lantern, and a wooden house surrounded this at the base of the light. The expense of constructing foundation for the two lights exhausted the original appropriation and delayed completion until 1875; in the intervening two years lightships were used instead. The wooden construction of the central shaft had problems with rotting almost from the start, and as recently as 1994 a Coast Guard study suggested that it be removed. However, with repairs over the years it remains in place. The house was reportedly rented out when the light was automated in 1923, and it was finally removed in 1938.

This large island extends into the continental coast, from which it is divided by the channels just mentioned. In its central part the extinct volcano Montalat rises to a height of 5,446 feet. The crater is at all times full of snow. In. the west coast of the island is Pangal Inlet, which is of no use to navigation. Five miles farther north of this is Senec Island, low and sloping, forming a good day mark, which should be left to the eastward in passing.

The western terminus of this state route is at a T-intersection with State Route 260 nearly southwest of Summerfield in eastern Noble County, and its eastern terminus is at State Route 145 approximately northwest of Stafford in western Monroe County. Route description State Route 724 begins at a T-intersection with State Route 260 in eastern Noble County's Stock Township. The entirety of the state highway passes amidst a forest, with the occasional grassy meadow making an appearance at select points along the route. State Route 724 starts out heading easterly, intersecting Noble County Road 43 before bending into a more southeasterly trend, passing Stock Township Highway 232 prior to meeting County Road 45. Here, the state route turns to the east-northeast, and comes across Township Highways 233 and 234 at back-to-back intersections. From Township Highway 234, the remainder of State Route 724 follows a generally eastward trajectory, with thick woods abutting the highway on both sides. After crossing the county line into Monroe County's Franklin Township, the state route ultimately arrives at its endpoint at its junction with State Route 145 northwest of Stafford. Continuing east of State Route 145 after State Route 724 terminates is Franklin Township Highway 834. No portion of State Route 724 is incorporated within the National Highway System. History State Route 724 was established in 1937 along the routing that it currently occupies between State Route 260 and State Route 145.

Design and development In the early 1930s Al Mooney was working for the Lambert Aircraft Corporation, builders of the Monocoupe series aircraft. He designed a small two-seat monoplane, the Monosport G. When the company ran into financial difficulties Mooney bought the rights to his design and with K.K. Culver formed the Dart Aircraft Company. The aircraft was renamed the Dart Dart or Dart Model G.Simpson, 2001, p. 170. The aircraft was a low-wing monoplane designed to be light with clean lines to enable it to use low powered aero-engines. It had a fixed undercarriage and a tailwheel. The initial version was named the Dart G powered by a 90 hp (67 kW) Lambert R-266 radial engine. That engine was in short supply, so the aircraft was fitted with a Ken-Royce engine and designated the Dart GK. The final version was the Dart GW powered by a Warner Scarab Junior radial engine. Two special aircraft were built with larger engines. In 1939 the company was renamed the Culver Aircraft Company and the aircraft was renamed the Culver Dart.

Formative years  Born in Adams County, Ohio to Samuel C. and Margeret (Maggie) Woods, Clarence was raised in both eastern Kansas and Carthage in southwest Missouri. Note that some sources list him as H. Clarence Woods, but multiple US Census and local Census records clearly list him as Clarence H. Woods, and his World War I Draft card shows him simply as Clarence Woods. The 1895 Kansas Census shows the family in Girard, Kansas. His father was a blacksmith, and he had two younger brothers and two younger sisters. Clarence was in the midst of a hotbed of ragtime as he grew up. He took piano lessons from the same teacher as James Scott, but whether they knew each other well is not known for certain. Both had their first compositions published by Dumars Music in Carthage as well, with Woods contributing Meteor March slightly in advance of Scott's On the Pike.  Early career  In his late teens, Woods started traveling outside of Missouri into Oklahoma and Texas, playing for stage plays, Vaudeville olios, silent films, and other accompanist positions. His performance skills eventually saw him lauded in print as the \\"Ragtime Wonder of the South.\\" He was married by 1913 or so to Marie E. Woods, and Clarence Jr. was born around 1914. In early 1917 he was listed at a Carthage residence of 301 N. Main, and playing for movies at the Sho-To-Al Theater. By 1920 Woods and the family had moved north to Nevada, Missouri, now playing for movies at the Star Theater plus other area engagements. Wood's ragtime output was small, but significant. Even though he had been on the road for some time he was still based in Carthage, his rags and blues heavily reflected the influence of the Jasper County area, with his Sleepy Hollow Rag named for a community on the Spring River near Carthage. Woods was more known as a performer than composer, although he co-wrote a few lesser songs and some early blues. Two of his novelty pieces appeared only on piano rolls, but both Black Satin and the recently discovered Fever Heat show signs of a clear understanding of that genre, in which he did not follow up. The 1930 Census shows Marie and Clarence Jr. back in Carthage, but she is now divorced from the traveling pianist. He was remarried now to Gladys Woods, based in Tulsa, Oklahoma, still listed as a theater pianist.  Later career  In Clarence's later years, he led an orchestra, became a radio entertainer, and started composing more. His last pieces, largely unknown and unpublished, were written in his capacity of composer/arranger, mostly for the presentational needs of Ringling Brothers Barnum and Bailey Circus from the early 1940s to the 1950s, where he also performed on the organ and calliope.

History The area now known as Oak Hill was initially known as Live Oak Springs in the 19th century. The land was awarded to William Cannon by the Mexican government in 1835, attracting settlers into the area. In 1865, unsuccessful attempts were made to change the community's name to Shiloh, after the American Civil War battle. In 1869, however, the community was given the name Oatmanville. Following the Civil War, the cedar forests around Oatmanville attracted settlers, particularly from the Appalachian Mountains, due to high demand for lumber-related production. Due to the increased demand for cedar, localized conflicts broke out between woodcutters. In 1870, a post office named Oak Hill was established, though the community would not immediately adopt that name. During the construction of the Texas State Capitol in Downtown Austin during the 1880s, stone quarries near the community were used for the capitol building's construction, resulting in a boom in the community's economy. The construction project also spurred the creation of the Austin and Oatmanville Railway, which was purposed to ship limestone from the community to the city, and was later abandoned in 1888. In 1904, Oak Hill's population grew in excess of 200 people, doubling by the 1970s. In 1910, the local post office was discontinued, with mail forwarding to the city of Austin instead. Nearly a century later in 2000, the area defined as Oak Hill was absorbed into Austin's city limits. =Demographics= When the area around Oak Hill was first settled in the 1830s and 1840s, there was very little population growth. However, as a result of demand for limestone to construct the Texas State Capitol and demand for cedar wood in the latter half of the 19th century, the population of Oak Hill quickly grew, reaching 200 by 1904. The community's population doubled between 1904 and the 1970s to 400, and then grew even faster with the development of suburban housing in the region. By 1990, the population of Oak Hill was 11,572. Over the ensuing decade, the combined Oak Hill planning area saw rapid population growth, more than twice as rapid as the Greater Austin metropolitan area. West Oak Hill saw population growth three times more rapid than Austin in the same time period. As of 2000, the total population of the combined planning area was 24,233 people, with slightly more than half of that in East Oak Hill. Of the total population of the combined planning area in 2000, 77.7% were white, 2.1% were black, 14.1% were Hispanic, 4.3% were Asian, and another 1.8% were considered to be of other races. There were 10,541 housing units at an average density of 606.5 per square mile (247.2/km2). The median family income for West Oak Hill was $77,208, compared to $89,262 for East Oak Hill. Geography The area upon which Oak Hill is located is characterized by mostly hilly terrain. Limestone rimrock structures are commonplace in Oak Hill. The community is located above the Edwards and Trinity aquifers, resulting in the abundance of caves, sinkholes, karst features, and springs, which allow for recharge and discharge of groundwater. In addition, Barton, Slaughter, and Williamson creeks, which all lead to the nearby Colorado River, flow through Oak Hill. Riparian woodlands exist along areas of these creeks. Threatened bird species, including the golden-cheeked warbler (Setophaga chrysoparia) and the black- capped vireo (Vireo atricapilla) live in some areas of Oak Hill. =Boundaries= As Oak Hill is not an incorporated community, it does not have any legal boundaries. The community of neighborhoods is centered around the intersection of U.S. Route 290/TX-71 and Williamson Creek, roughly southwest of the center of Austin. The Oak Hill Association of Neighborhoods (OHAN) defines Oak Hill as \\"...starting from Travis Country in the Northwest, neighborhoods bordering Brodie Lane down to the Travis/Hays County line, following the county line on the south up to Highway 290 West, and then neighborhoods bordering Circle Drive and Thomas Springs Road and finally along the Southwest Parkway.\\" The boundaries defined by OHAN include areas within six ZIP codes and 89 neighborhoods, including Circle C Ranch. However, only 29 neighborhood homeowners' associations are members of OHAN. The city of Austin defines West Oak Hill and East Oak Hill as neighborhood planning areas, encompassing areas adjacent to U.S. Route 290 from Circle Drive to a location slightly east of Texas State Highway Loop 1. Spanning , the neighborhood planning area is Austin's largest. Government and infrastructure Historical marker at the local Austin Pizza Garden, formerly the Old Rock Store The Oak Hill community was fully annexed by the city of Austin in 1989, though some areas of Oak Hill were already annexed by the city in the years prior. However, areas of the community designated as official city planning areas are not within city borders, but are nonetheless within the purview of extraterritorial jurisdiction. Within Austin's municipal government, Austin City Council District 8 primarily covers the Oak Hill area in addition to other parts of southwest Austin, a change which went into effect in November 2013. Several neighborhood associations in the area are part of OHAN, which meets monthly to propose changes and receive input on infrastructure and community decisions for Oak Hill. The association of neighborhoods is led by a board of directors elected by members of the association annually. On a county level, the Oak Hill area, in addition to much of southwestern Travis County, is under the jurisdiction of Travis County Commissioner Precinct 3. Republican Gerald Daughtery, who was elected in 2008, represents the precinct The United States Postal Service maintains a post office in Oak Hill, located adjacent to U.S. 290 on 6104 Old Fredericksburg Road. =Emergency and medical services= Areas of Oak Hill within Austin city limits are served by the Austin Fire Department (AFD). The first AFD fire station specifically purposed to serve the Oak Hill area was constructed in August 1999. However, Oak Hill is also served by the Oak Hill Volunteer Fire Department, which was founded in April 1968\\\\. The fire department was originally assigned to an area \\"...from Brodie Lane to Barton Creek, and from Sunset Valley to Dripping Springs.\\" However, in 1992, the expansion of Austin's city boundaries limited the fire department's coverage area to unincorporated regions of Travis County. Today, the department serves 22,000 people in a region in the southwestern part of the county. Areas inside the Austin city limits are served by the Austin Police Department. The Southwest Patrol, headquartered at 539-A West Oltorf Road, patrols Oak Hill. Unincorporated areas are served by Travis County Sheriff's Office Constable Precinct 3.

Nearby is the American Spangdahlem Air Base.  Geography  = Location = The municipality lies in the South Eifel. The nearest middle centres are Wittlich and Bitburg. It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Wittlich-Land, whose seat is in Wittlich, although that town is itself not in the Verbandsgemeinde.  History  In 844, Binsfeld had its first documentary mention. Binsfeld was in the 17th century held by the Electorate of Trier. No later than 1551 (Binsfeld postal cross), Binsfeld had a postal station on the Dutch Postal Route (Niederl√§ndischer Postkurs) from Brussels by way of Augsburg to Innsbruck, Trento and Italy. From 1794, Binsfeld lay under French rule, and in 1815 was assigned to the Kingdom of Prussia at the Congress of Vienna. Since 1946, it has been part of the then newly founded state of Rhineland-Palatinate. From 1900 to 1965, Binsfeld was linked to the Cologne-Trier section of the Eifelbahn (railway) by the Philippsheim‚ÄìBinsfeld narrow-gauge railway.

The municipality‚Äôs arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: Per fess argent a cross gules, and gules a wheel spoked of six Or. The arms were taken from those borne by the now no longer existing Verbandsgemeinde of Binsfeld. The village was formerly ruled by the Electorate of Trier, whence comes the charge above the line of partition, Electoral Trier‚Äôs red cross on a silver field. The golden wheel stands for both agriculture and the huckster‚Äôs trade that was formerly widespread in Binsfeld. This was once paramount to the local commercial structure, as farming still is today. Binsfeld was granted the right to bear its own arms in 1980. = Town partnerships = Binsfeld fosters partnerships with the following places: * Binsfeld, a constituent community of Arnstein, Main-Spessart, Bavaria since 1987  Culture and sightseeing * Kaiserm√ºhle (mill) * Steam locomotive memorial  Economy and infrastructure  = Transport = Binsfeld lies right on Bundesstra√üe 50 and Landesstra√üe (State Road) 46.

It has also been released as Angst in the English-speaking world. It is loosely based on the Stefan Zweig novel Fear. It was filmed in Munich and was shot simultaneously in German and English. Rossellini created it because he wanted to explore the reconstruction of Germany from both a material and moral standpoint ten years after making his previous German film Germany, Year Zero. The film is noirish with aspects reminiscent of Hitchcock and German Expressionism. Plot Irene Wagner (Bergman), the wife of prominent German scientist Professor Albert Wagner (Wieman), had been having an affair with Erich Baumann (Kreuger). She does not disclose this to her husband, hoping to preserve his innocence and their \\"perfect marriage\\". This fills her with anxiety and guilt. However, Johann Schultze (Mannhardt), Erich's jealous ex-girlfriend, learns about the affair and begins to blackmail Irene, turning Irene's psychological torture into a harsh reality. When Irene finds out that the extortion plot is truly an experiment in fear, she is driven into a homicidal/suicidal rage. But she is saved from suicide by her husband at the last minute, both sorry for what they did. Cast * Ingrid Bergman as Irene Wagner * Mathias Wieman as Professor Albert Wagner * Renate Mannhardt as Luisa Vidor, alias Johann Schultze * Kurt Kreuger as Erich Baumann * Elise Aulinger as Haushaelterin * Edith Schultze- Westrum * Steffi Stroux (credited as Steffi Struck) * Annelore Wied * Klaus Kinski as Cabaret Performer Reception The film did not do well when it was released in Italy and Germany. Consequently, the Italian distributor edited the film and re-released it as Non credo pi√π all'amore. In this edited version, a fishing scene is shortened and an explanatory narration is added to two silent scenes. In addition, the ending was changed from a scene showing Bergman attempting suicide to a scene showing her family in the countryside, after Bergman had left her husband, living on for the sake of her children. The Rossellini Project This initiative involves 10 films by Roberto Rossellini that are being digitally restored and will then be promoted internationally. Carrying out the restoration work are Cinecitt√† Luce- Filmitalia, the Cineteca di Bologna, the Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia, and the Coproduction Office. Fear is one of the ten films being restored. The others are: Rome, Open City (Roma citt√† aperta), Paisan (Pais√†), Germany Year Zero (Germania anno zero), L‚Äôamore, Stromboli (Stromboli terra di Dio), The Machine that Kills Bad People (La Macchina ammazzacattivi), Journey to Italy (Viaggio in Italia), India: Matri Bhumi, and Interview with Salvador Allende (Intervista a Salvador Allende: La forza e la ragione).

Breit belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Thalfang am Erbeskopf, whose seat is in the municipality of Thalfang.  History  In the early 13th century, Breit had its first documentary mention in the name ‚ÄúConrad von Breit‚Äù in a record from St. Maximin‚Äôs Abbey. After the French Revolution, the Rhine‚Äôs left bank, and along with it Breit, were ceded to France in 1794 and 1795. Through a law from 26 March 1798, the French abolished feudal rights in their zone of occupation. After French rule ended, the village passed in 1814 to the Kingdom of Prussia. Since 1947, it has been part of the then newly founded state of Rhineland-Palatinate. Since administrative reform in Rhineland-Palatinate in 1969, Breit has belonged to the Verbandsgemeinde of Thalfang am Erbeskopf in the Bernkastel-Wittlich district.

In 1978 he became a member of the Sicilian Mafia Commission. Ciccio Madonia became the unquestioned patriarch of the Resuttana Mafia family and mandamento. He replaced Antonino Matranga, murdered in 1970, and strongly supported the Corleonesi during the Second Mafia War in 1981-83. In 1987, at the Maxi Trial, he was sentenced to life for murder, but he went on running the Family from prison; first through his sons Antonino, Giuseppe and Salvatore Salvino Madonia, all three jailed, after that through his brother Diego, the reputed acting boss. Life sentences Ciccio Madonia had several life sentences and was involved in several of the most bloody events in the 1980s. He actively cooperated in the elimination of the old Palermitan bosses of the Second Mafia War, such as Stefano Bontade and Salvatore Inzerillo. He has also been involved in the murders of Piersanti Mattarella, the Christian Democrat president of the autonomous region of Sicily in 1980; general Carlo Alberto Dalla Chiesa, the prefect of Palermo in 1982; police chief Ninni Cassar√† in 1985; and Libero Grassi, the Palermitan businessman who was killed by the Mafia after refusing to pay extortion money, known as \\"pizzo\\". Francesco Madonia was involved in the failed bomb attack against Antimafia judge Giovanni Falcone at Addaura in 1989 (which is in the Resuttana mandamento) and the killings of Falcone and his colleague Paolo Borsellino in 1992. Morto Madonia, boss di Resuttana, La Repubblica, March 14, 2007 He was arrested in 1987 together with his son Giuseppe Madonia. However, despite his life sentence at the Maxi Trial, the most important Mafia bosses of the Commission spent months at a time not at Ucciardone prison, but in hotel-like conditions of Palermo‚Äôs Ospedale Civico (Civic Hospital). The director of the hospital was Giuseppe Lima, the brother of Salvo Lima, member of parliament suspected of mafia ties.Stille, Excellent Cadavers, p. 276 In 1989, the police discovered the hideout of Francesco‚Äôs son Nino Madonia that contained an account book of the family‚Äôs extortion business which listed some 150 businessmen.Stille, Excellent Cadavers, p. 346-47 The ledger included the names of car dealers, drugstores, restaurants, and small factories that were lined up next to the amounts of their pizzo ‚Äì from about US$150 to US$7,000 a month. None of the more than 150 businessmen on the list would help identify the extortionists.A Bullet For a Businessman , Business Week, November 4, 1991Paoli, Mafia Brotherhoods, p. 169 Francesco Madonia has been convicted for ordering the killing of Libero Grassi in 1991, the Palermo businessman who refused to pay protection money (the so-called pizzo) and went on national television to denounce the practice. Grassi's business was in the area that is controlled by the Madonia clan. His son Salvatore Salvino Madonia was the killer. On 14 November 1992, Madonia and Salvatore Riina were sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of Emanuele Basile.https://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1992/11/15/uccise- il-capitano-basile-per-riina.html Death He died on March 13, 2007, in a prison hospital in Naples where he was serving his life sentences under the severe conditions of the article 41-bis prison regime. In November 2008, Italian police arrested five people, including Maria Angela Di Trapani, the wife of jailed Sicilian Mafia boss Antonino Madonia, and seized assets worth 15 million euros, anti-Mafia investigators believe belong to the Madonias. The assets include farmland and farm buildings, villas, apartments and businesses in Sicily.Police arrest five Mafia suspects in Sicily, AND Kronos, November 25, 2008 Madonia's jailed sons, Antonino, Giuseppe and Salvatore are all in high-security detention under the harsh 41-bis prison regime for Mafia prisoners that is meant to severely restrict their contact with other prisoners and the outside world. Nevertheless, they have continued to run the Madonia clan, issuing orders via Di Trapani and exchanging information with the Di Trapani clan, according to investigators.

(b) H&E; stained tissue. N-glycans at m/z = 1996.7 (c) is located in the cortex and medulla while m/z = 2158.7 (d) is in the cortex, (e) An overlay image of these two masses, (f) untreated control tissue. MALDI mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) is the use of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization as a mass spectrometry imaging technique in which the sample, often a thin tissue section, is moved in two dimensions while the mass spectrum is recorded. Advantages, like measuring the distribution of a large amount of analytes at one time without destroying the sample, make it a useful method in tissue-based study.  Sample preparation  Target for MALDI imaging with two conductive-surface microscope slides. Sample preparation is a critical step in imaging spectroscopy. Scientists take thin tissue slices mounted on conductive microscope slides and apply a suitable MALDI matrix to the tissue, either manually or automatically. Next, the microscope slide is inserted into a MALDI mass spectrometer. The mass spectrometer records the spatial distribution of molecular species such as peptides, proteins or small molecules. Suitable image processing software can be used to import data from the mass spectrometer to allow visualization and comparison with the optical image of the sample. Recent work has also demonstrated the capacity to create three- dimensional molecular images using MALDI imaging technology and comparison of these image volumes to other imaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). = Tissue preparation = The tissue samples must be preserved quickly in order to reduce molecular degradation. The first step is to freeze the sample by wrapping the sample then submerging it in a cryogenic solution. Once frozen, the samples can be stored below -80 ¬∞C for up to a year. When ready to be analyzed, the tissue is embedded in a gelatin media which supports the tissue while it is being cut, while reducing contamination that is seen in optimal cutting temperature compound (OCT) techniques. The mounted tissue section thickness varies depending on the tissue. Tissue sections can then be thaw-mounted by placing the sample on the surface of a conductive slide that is of the same temperature, and then slowly warmed from below. The section can also be adhered to the surface of a warm slide by slowly lowering the slide over the cold sample until the sample sticks to the surface. The sample can then be stained in order to easily target areas of interest, and pretreated with washing in order to remove species that suppress molecules of interest. Washing with varying grades of ethanol removes lipids in tissues that have a high lipid concentration with little delocalization and maintains the integrity of the peptide spatial arrangement within the sample. (a) Rat lung tissue, (b-e) distribution of four different phosphatidylcholines present in (a) = Matrix application = The matrix must absorb at the laser wavelength and ionize the analyte. Matrix selection and solvent system relies heavily upon the analyte class desired in imaging. The analyte must be soluble in the solvent in order to mix and recrystallize the matrix. The matrix must have a homogeneous coating in order to increase sensitivity, intensity, and shot-to- shot reproducibility. Minimal solvent is used when applying the matrix in order to avoid delocalization. One technique is spraying. The matrix is sprayed, as very small droplets, onto the surface of the sample, allowed to dry, and re-coated until there is enough matrix to analyze the sample. The size of the crystals depend on the solvent system used. Sublimation can also be used to make uniform matrix coatings with very small crystals. The matrix is placed in a sublimation chamber with the mounted tissue sample inverted above it. Heat is applied to the matrix, causing it to sublime and condense onto the surface of the sample. Controlling the heating time controls the thickness of the matrix on the sample and the size of the crystals formed. Automated spotters are also used by regularly spacing droplets throughout the tissue sample. The image resolution relies on the spacing of the droplets. = Image production = Images are constructed by plotting ion intensity versus relative position of the data from the sample. Spatial resolution highly impacts the molecular information gained from analysis.  Applications  MALDI-IMS involves the visualization of the spatial distribution of proteins, peptides, lipids, and other small molecules within thin slices of tissue, such as animal or plant. The application of this technique to biological studies has increased significantly since its introduction. MALDI-IMS is providing major contributions to the understanding of diseases, improving diagnostics, and drug delivery. Significant studies are of the eye, cancer research, drug distribution, and neuroscience. MALDI-IMS has been able to differentiate between drugs and metabolites and provide histological information in cancer research, which makes it a promising tool for finding new protein biomarkers. However, this can be challenging because of ion suppression, poor ionization, and low molecular weight matrix fragmentation effects. To combat this, chemical derivatization is used to improve detection.

Geography  = Location = The municipality lies in the Eifel on the long-distance hiking trail, the Eifelsteig, some 10 km west of the district seat, Wittlich, at an elevation of 190 m above sea level. Bruch also lies on both sides of the river Salm. It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Wittlich-Land, whose seat is in Wittlich, although that town is itself not in the Verbandsgemeinde.  History  Bruch's beginnings are believed to reach all the way back to Roman times. Finds and remains such as a Roman graveyard, for instance, are clues to this. In 1138, Bruch had its first documentary mention in the name Fridelo de Brucha, who cropped up in the Himmerod Monastery's founding document. Until this Family ‚Äúvon Bruch‚Äù died out about 1334, the village's history was tightly bound to this family's. After their days had ended, the lordship passed to Dietrich von Dune (Daun). In the 16th century, Bruch was granted its own jurisdiction. The gallows that came along with this stood on the so-called Galgenberg (‚ÄúGallows Mountain‚Äù) east of the castle, on an old linking road to Bergweiler. In the 18th century, the village's geographical situation as outlined above led to a rather odd situation: The village belonged to two separate states, as the lands west of the Salm were part of the Duchy of Luxembourg and those lying east of the river belonged to the Electorate of Trier As of 1794, though, the whole of Bruch lay under French rule. In 1815, the village was assigned to the Kingdom of Prussia at the Congress of Vienna. Since 1946, it has been part of the then newly founded state of Rhineland- Palatinate.

The municipality's arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: Bendy of six Or and gules, a castle argent with roofs and windows azure. The castle is, of course, the local one, the Brucher Burg, and the diagonal-stripe pattern (‚Äúbendy‚Äù) was the arms borne by the noble Lords of Bruch, who lived at the castle, their family seat, in the first half of the 12th century. Bruch was granted the right to bear its own arms in 1983.  Culture and sightseeing Brucher Burg = Moated castle = The moated castle in Bruch, standing in a hollow surrounded by wooded hills on the Salm, dates in its older parts from the early 14th century, and was the seat of the Lords of Bruch, who are witnessed beginning in the 12th century. Today the castle is under private ownership. = Further points of interest = * Burghaus (Hepgesburg) (1413) * Oilmill (from the 19th century, established at one of the oldest mills on the Salm, from 1284) * Potter's workshop with an old kiln from the 17th century * Saint Roch‚Äôs Parish Church (Pfarrkirche St. Rochus, built in 1807) * Disused copper mine from 1740 * Galgenberg (‚ÄúGallows Mountain‚Äù), old execution site * Burgstra√üe 6, sandstone figures and reliefs  References   External links  * Municipality‚Äôs official webpage * Brief portrait of Bruch at SWR Fernsehen Category:Bernkastel-Wittlich ","title":"Bruch, Rhineland-Palatinate"},{"id":"11789612","text":"HealthPlanOne, LLC., now known as HPOne, is a sales and marketing organization that operates across multiple segments of the Medicare and health insurance marketplaces.

In 1840 Benbow saw action in the bombardment of the city of Acre under the command of Admiral Robert Stopford. At the height of the battle either Benbow or the naval steamer fired the shell that destroyed Acre's powder magazine, causing an explosion that greatly weakened the city's defences.Kahanov 2014, p.152.
