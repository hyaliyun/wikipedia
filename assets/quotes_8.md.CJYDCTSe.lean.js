History The school used to be the Glossop Grammar School from the 1920s, being on Talbot Road since 1959, becoming Glossop Comprehensive School in 1965 when it merged with West End Secondary Modern (on Sunlaws Street and Chadwick Street and opened in 1913 as Glossop Independent Council School), and Castle School Secondary Modern in Hadfield. In 1989, the former Hadfield Comprehensive School on Newshaw Lane in Hadfield merged with the Glossop School to form the Glossopdale School. The Chadwick Street site is next to the St Philip Howard RC Academy (Glossop's other secondary school) on St Mary's Road. As Glossopdale Community College, the school was awarded Specialist Performing Arts College status in September 2005, and also International Schools Status in July 2010. It is a member of the Peak 11 Learning Federation. In 2017 Glossopdale Community College started to build a new purpose built school on the playing fields of the Hadfield site. The new building would cater for all year groups and end the split site system that operated for nearly 3 decades. The school officially opened and started accepting pupils in 2018 and this coincided with a name change for the school to Glossopdale School. The old school buildings in Hadfield have been demolished to create new playing fields for the new school. The buildings and land associated with the Glossop site (Talbot Road, Cemetery Road and Fauval Road) have been currently mothballed. Admissions Until 2018, the school was spread over three sites; Hadfield, Glossop and Talbot House. The youngest students attended Hadfield site on Newshaw Lane, Hadfield. When the students moved into Year 9 they moved to Glossop Site on Talbot Road, Glossop. There was also a Sixth Form College in the historic 19th-century Talbot House, also on Talbot Road. In 2016 construction began on a new building on the Hadfield site, designed to merge all 3 previous sites into one building, which opened in 2018. The school was part of a successful pilot scheme, and subsequently offers C3 ‚Äì a combined humanities curriculum ‚Äì to Years 7 and 8. Glossopdale has also taken part in several teachers' television documentaries. Debbie McGloin was appointed as the headteacher in 2018, replacing Steven Playford. Specialist school status In 2002 the school successfully applied to become a specialist Arts College. Music department Glossopdale Community College has a music department, which reflects the school's status as a Performing Arts College. It has a large selection of bands as well as the choirs. There is an award-winning Big Band, Wind Band, Brass Band, Samba Band, Flutz (a Flute ensemble) and Training Band. During the 1970s and 1980s particularly, Glossop School Brass Band were an internationally renowned band, producing several LPs and touring Europe and the United States. , mickila.co.uk, accessed 28 September 2012 Glossopdale Community College has a choir. Over the years, the choir has performed at festivals and won awards, and also made appearances on BBC television series All the Small Things in 2008. The Music Department takes part in a number of concert tours abroad, the most recent of which were in Paris, Salzburg, and Barcelona. Academic performance The school was given an overall effectiveness rating of 'Requires Improvement' in their most recent Ofsted inspection, which took place in March 2016. In 2012, 58% of pupils gained 5 A*‚ÄìC GCSE grades including English and Maths, a 20% improvement over 4 years. 87% of pupils achieved 5 A*‚ÄìC grades. In 2016, the Progress 8 score for the school's GCSE results was -0.23; this is below the average Progress 8 for schools in England. The 2016 A-Level results had a progress score of -0.13, which is in line with the national average, and the average grade achieved was C.https://www.compare-school- performance.service.gov.uk/school/112957 Notable former pupils * Peter Goodwright * David Hargreaves (actor) * Sydney Hope, Conservative MP from 1931-35 for Stalybridge and Hyde * James Hurst CBE, President in 1935 of the Institute of British Foundrymen (Institute of Cast Metals Engineers) * Harold Fletcher (botanist), Regius Keeper of the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh from 1956‚Äì70 * Prof Thomas Walker, Professor of Industrial Biochemistry from 1956‚Äì58 at the University of Manchester * Dame Vivienne Westwood, fashion designer *Stuart Hall References External links * Official Glossopdale Website * EduBase Category:Secondary schools in Derbyshire Category:Community schools in Derbyshire Category:Glossop ","title":"Glossopdale School"},{"id":"17657757","text":"Liebenstein Castle () is a castle in Liebenstein in the Ilm-Kreis, Thuringia, Germany.

Medieval Bulgarian literature is Bulgarian literature in the Middle Ages. With the Bulgarian Empire welcoming the disciples of Cyril and Methodius after they were expelled from Great Moravia, the country became a centre of rich literary activity during what is known as the Golden Age of medieval Bulgarian culture. In the late 9th, the 10th and early 11th century literature in Bulgaria prospered, with many books being translated from Byzantine Greek, but also new works being created. Many scholars worked in the Preslav and Ohrid Literary Schools, creating the Cyrillic script for their needs. Bulgarian scholars and works influenced most of the Slavic world, spreading Old Church Slavonic, the Cyrillic and the Glagolithic alphabet to Kievan Rus', medieval Serbia and medieval Croatia. As the Bulgarian Empire was subjugated by the Byzantines in 1018, Bulgarian literary activity declined. However, after the establishment of the Second Bulgarian Empire followed another period of upsurge during the time of Patriarch Evtimiy in the 14th century. Evtimiy founded the Tarnovo Literary School that had a significant impact on the literature of Serbia and Muscovite Russia, as some writers fled the Bulgarian-Ottoman Wars. Bulgarian literature continued in the Ottoman empire. Medieval Bulgarian literature was dominated by religious themes, most works being hymns, treatises, religious miscellanies, apocrypha and hagiographies, most often heroic and instructive.

Life Compton was the third son of Spencer Compton, 2nd Earl of Northampton and his wife Mary Beaumont. At the beginning of the First English Civil War he was directed by his father to take up arms for Charles I, who gave him the command of a regiment. He was in action at the taking of Banbury. He led his men on to three attacks, and had two horses shot under him. On the surrender of the town and castle he was made lieutenant-governor under his father, and was knighted at Oxford on 12 December 1643.:s:Compton, Sir William (1625-1663) (DNB00) The parliamentary forces of Northamptonshire, Warwick, and Coventry, came before the town of Banbury on 19 July 1644, but he defied them. A siege lasted thirteen weeks, relieved on 26 October by his brother, James Compton, 3rd Earl of Northampton by that time. Compton continued governor of Banbury until the king left Oxford, and when the whole kingdom was submitting to the parliament he, on 8 May 1646, surrendered upon honourable terms. In 1648 he served the king in the Kentish expedition, and in the absence of George Goring, 1st Earl of Norwich commanded as general at Greenwich. As major-general of the king's forces at Colchester, when that town was besieged by General Thomas Fairfax, he kept the garrison in some competent order while they were enduring privations. Compton, after being confined for some time, was set at liberty. Oliver Cromwell called him \\"the sober young man, and the godly cavalier.\\" He was one of the Sealed Knot who managed all the eight attempts made for the restoration of Charles II from 1652 to 1659. Compton was in prison in 1655, and was again arrested in 1658. After the Restoration Compton was elected Member of Parliament for Cambridge on 11 March 1661 for the Cavalier Parliament.

Compton died suddenly in Drury Lane, London, on 18 October 1663, and was buried at Compton- Wynyates, Warwickshire, where a monument was erected to his memory. Samuel Pepys, who was Compton's colleague on the Committee for Tangier, was shocked and saddened at his unexpected death, especially since he had seemed to be in perfect health a few days earlier. Pepys praised him as \\"a man in a thousand\\", of whom no one ever spoke an ill word. He noted sourly that despite the genuine grief for Compton, the merrymaking at Court continued unabated, and drew the moral that \\"we all die alike, no more matter being made of the death of one than another.\\" Compton married Elizabeth (n√©e Tollemache), daughter of Sir Lionel Tollemache, 2nd Baronet and Elizabeth Stanhope, and widow of William Alington, 1st Baron Alington.

Together with the United Nations Foundation, they are a product of entrepreneur and philanthropist Ted Turner‚Äôs historic $1 billion gift in 1998 to support UN causes. Led by Peter M. Yeo, the Campaign encourages U.S. leadership to enhance the UN‚Äôs ability to carry out its invaluable international work on behalf of peace, progress, freedom, and justice. In these efforts, BWC engages policy makers, the media, and the American public to increase awareness of and support for the United Nations. BWC is a leading member of the U.S. Global Leadership Coalition.U.S. Global Leadership Coalition, Global Trust members BWC Key Issues The Better World Campaign builds support for U.S. policies that reinforce American engagement in the United Nations and educate people about the real benefits the U.S. receives through their relationships with the UN. BWC focuses on U.S.-UN relations, U.S. funding for the UN, peacekeeping, development, and global health issues. U.S.-UN Relations Headquartered in New York City, the United Nations is the primary forum for leaders across the globe to discuss the most serious challenges facing the world. The Better World Campaign believes that the UN is critical to enhancing American interests abroad, and with its help, the U.S. can share the burden with other countries and not have to go it alone in addressing the world‚Äôs problems. According to a BWC 2014 poll conducted by the bipartisan research team of Public Opinion Strategies and Hart Research Associates, eighty seven percent of Americans agreed that it is important ‚Äúfor the United States to maintain an active role within the United Nations‚Äù and more than seven out of ten voters support the United States ‚Äúpaying our peacekeeping dues to the United Nations on time and in full.‚Äù BWC hosts many events throughout the year on Capitol Hill and beyond to highlight the UN's work and cultivate close relationships between U.S. government officials and UN representatives. U.S. Funding to the UN The United Nations supports its activities through member countries' assessed dues as well as through voluntary contributions for funds and programs, such as the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and World Food Programme (WFP). In the United States, the President requests funding for the UN in his annual budget proposal, and Congress refines his request and allocates funds in an annual appropriations bill under the oversight of the House and Senate Foreign Affairs Committees and the State, Foreign Operations and Appropriations subcommittees. The U.S. maintains significant financial contributions to the UN because leaders see significant return on the investment as the UN supports and advances many U.S. national interests. The formula that determines assessments is negotiated every three years by the U.S. and other member states and must be voted on. The Better World Campaign works closely with Congress and the Administration to ensure that the U.S. is fulfilling its obligations by paying its dues to the UN. UN Peacekeeping The United Nations oversees 14 peacekeeping operations around the world. With more than 100,000 troops and personnel deployed, UN peacekeepers make up the second largest deployed military presence in the world. UN peacekeeping supports global and national security at a fraction of what it would cost to send in U.S. personnel ‚Äì eight times more economical according to the Government Accountability Office (GAO). They draw upon the economic and human resources of UN Member States, allowing the U.S. to share the burden of protecting global peace and security and reducing the need for the U.S. to send their own military troops to volatile regions. The Better World Campaign helps promote greater U.S. assistance to UN peacekeeping operations in order to strengthen each mission's capabilities in logistics, training, doctrine, and management expertise. Global Health The Better World Campaign works to educate Members of Congress and their staff on key global health areas where the U.S. and the UN's work are complementary. BWC focuses most closely on issues like malaria, immunization and vaccinations, girls‚Äô empowerment, voluntary family planning, and supports a variety of UN agencies including the World Health Organization, UNICEF, and UNFPA, among others. Leadership Peter Yeo is the President of the Better World Campaign. Yeo leads the Campaign's strategic engagement with Congress and the Administration to promote a strong U.S.-UN relationship. He joined BWC in 2009 with over twenty years of legislative, analytical, and management experience, including senior roles on Capitol Hill and in the State Department. Under Yeo's leadership, BWC has helped ensure multibillion-dollar payments from the U.S. government to the UN and over $700 million in back dues. Yeo also serves as the Senior Vice President for the United Nations Foundation. Grassroots Initiatives The Better World Campaign works closely with the United Nations Association of the United States (UNA-USA)‚Äîtogether forming the largest grassroots network of UN supporters in the world‚Äîto inform, inspire and mobilize Americans to support the principles and vital work of the United Nations and to strengthen the United Nations system. BWC Achievements BWC has worked to generate support for achievements such as: *Re-payment of $926 million in U.S. debt to the UN, according to the terms of the 1999 Helms-Biden agreement. The final of 3 payments was released in September 2002. *Full funding of U.S. assessments for UN peacekeeping operations since 2001, preventing the accrual of new US arrears to the UN. *Progress toward timely payment of U.S. dues to the UN regular budget.

Life He entered the Jesuit novitiate on 20 October 1768, and taught grammar at Bologna and Imola. After the suppression of the order in 1773 he received a benefice at Ferrara and, somewhat later, was made director of the Collegio dei Nobili at Parma. Pope Pius VII summoned him to Rome, and appointed him theologian of the Poenitentiaria. When Pius VII was exiled in 1809, Muzzarelli was also obliged to leave Rome and was transported to Paris, where he spent his remaining life at the convent of the Dames de Saint-Michel. Works He wrote numerous theological, philosophical and ascetical works. His chief production is a collection of philosophico-theological treatises published repeatedly under the title \\"Il buon uso della Logica in materia di Religione\\" (6 vols., Foligno, 1787-9), with additions by the author (10 vols., Rome, 1807; 11 vols. Florence, 1821-3). The collection contains sketches on the theological questions on the day such as - abuses in the Church, the temporal power of the pope, religious toleration, ecclesiastical immunity, riches of the Church and its clergy, primacy and infallibility of the pope, auricular confession, religious institutes, indulgences, Gregory VII, moral liberty, etc. This collection of treatises, with the exception of the last five, was translated into Latin by Zeldmayer de Buzitha (\\"Bonus usus logiae in materia religionis\\", Kaschau, 1818-7). A French translation, containing 42 treatises, was published at Brussels in 1837. Two other major productions of Muzzarelli are \\"L'Emilio disingannato\\" (4 vols., Siena, 1782-3) and \\"Confutasione del contratto sociale di Gian Jacopo Rousseau\\" (2 vols., Foligno, 1794) - the former is a refutation of Rousseau's Emile, the Iatter of his Contrat social. The most popular of Muzzarelli's many ascetical works is \\"Il mese di Maria o sia di Maggio\\" (Ferrara, 1785) of which about 100 editions have been issued (new ed., Bologna, 1901). It was translated into English (\\"The Month of Mary or the Month of May\\", London, 1848, 187), Spanish (\\"Las Vegas\\", New Mexico, 1887, 1888); Portuguese (Oporto, 1890); French (Paris, 1881, and often previously); Arabic (4 ed., Beyrouth, 1872); and adapted to the German (Mainz, 1883). Another little work that has been translated into English is: \\"Il buon uso delle vacanze\\" (Parma, 1798). Its English title is: \\"A Method of spending the Vacation profitably.

The Tarnovo Literary School () of the late 14th and 15th century was a major medieval Bulgarian cultural academy with important contribution to the Medieval Bulgarian literature established in the capital of Bulgaria Tarnovo. It was part of the Tarnovo School of Art which was characteristic for the culture of the Second Bulgarian Empire. With the orthographic reform of Saint Evtimiy of Tarnovo and prominent representatives such as Gregory Tsamblak or Constantine of Kostenets the school influenced Russian, Serbian, Wallachian and Moldavian medieval culture. That is famous in Russia as the second South-Slavic influence.  Origin and development  The main prerequisite for the Tarnovo Literary School was the cultural revival of the late 14th century. It was largely due to the interest of Emperor Ivan Alexander (1331‚Äì1371) in literature and art and the traditions that he left to his sons and successors Ivan Shishman and Ivan Stratsimir in that direction. Patriarch Theodosius of Tarnovo also had some credit to the establishment of the School. The school was established in the capital of the Bulgarian Empire Tarnovo by Saint Evtimiy of Tarnovo. It established his orthographic and linguistic reform rules of the Bulgarian language and wrongly translated texts were corrected, becoming models for the Orthodox churches of Bulgaria, Serbia, Wallachia, Moldavia and Russia that also used the Church Slavonic language. The main work of the writers of the Tarnovo Literary School included writing original literature, translation of books from Greek and creation of compilations.  Characteristics  The literature of the Tarnovo literary school is divided into two major parts - religious and secular. The religious literature is represented by praising epistles, passionals, hymns and others. The main task for the authors of the passionals was to glorify the saints and there is a marked stress on the element of miracles which is compulsory for that genre used by most of the writers, such as Evtimiy and Tsamblak. The attitude to the different heretic movements like Bogomilism, Barlaamism or Adamism is very hostile which mirrored the official position of the Tarnovo Patriarchate. The secular literature include a short stories, novels, novelettes, poetry and chronicles. According to the type of stories the novelettes can be divided into three main parts: antique (\\"Alexandria\\", \\"Troyanska pritcha\\" (Trojan legend) and others, which depicting scenes from the history of ancient Greece), Eastern novelettes (\\"Varlaam and Yoasaf\\", \\"Akir Premadry\\" - texts from the Indian and Assyrian-Babylonian literature) and medieval (\\"Teophana - The proprietress\\" and events in the history of Bulgaria and Byzantium). The novels are very diverse, but also can be divided into three groups: the chronicles (stories about historical events), patherical texts (short stories with one story) and ancient - folklore (\\"Tales of Aesop\\", \\"By the Origin of Samodivas\\" with themes from Bulgarian mythology and ancient history). Stories for movement of saints' relics were very wide spread, but there is no agreement whether these stories can be considered for sequels of the passionals or a separate genre. Along with the consolidation of the miraculous properties of the relics, the authors praised the rulers who took care of their movement and safe-keeping which always contain short but valuable historical information.  Representatives  The main representatives include: A page of the Tomiƒá Psalter produced around 1360. *Evtimiy of Tarnovo - a disciple of Theodosius of Tarnovo. He was a creator and head of the Tarnovo Literary School, as well as a teacher. He was author of passionals, praising epistles, breves and others. Except for his reform, Evtimiy introduced a new genre in the Orthodox literature which included features of both passionals and praising epistles. *Grigoriy Dobropisets - a disciple of Theodosius of Tarnovo, author of the passional of the Bulgarian saint Romil of Vidin. *Dionisiy Divniy - a disciple of Theodosius of Tarnovo. He was famous for translating books from Greek to Bulgarian and thus won his nickname Divni, meaning marvelous. *Cyprian - a disciple of Theodosius of Tarnovo. Author of passionals, hymns and other works and translator. *Gregory Tsamblak - a disciple of Evtimiy. With his work in Visoki Deƒçani, Moldavia and the Russian principalities, he spread the ideas of his teacher and the influence of the Tarnovo Literary School. He was author of numerous works including Praising epistle for Evtimiy which contains valuable data for the Patriarch and the Bulgarian history and Book of Gregory Tsamblak which is the only collection with works of a Slavic writer from that time. *Constantine of Kostenets - a disciple of Andrey who was a direct follower of Evtimiy. He lived and worked in the court of the Serbian despot Stefan Lazareviƒá. He established in the Pomoravie region the Resava Literary School. *Joasaph of Bdin - the teacher of the bishop of Vidin was unknown but his work Praising epistle for the movement of St Philotea relics from Tarnovo to Vidin contained all features of the Tarnovo Literary School. The author demonstrated great respect to Evtimiy of Tarnovo. *Vladislav the Grammarian - a late representative. He was a translator, compilator, transcriber and calligrapher. His only known author work is Rila novellete which is a sequel to Passional of St John of Rila by Evtimiy. The work contains important date for the reestablishment of the Rila Monastery in the second half of the 15th century and the transfer of the relics of St John of Rila in the monastery in 1469. *Dimitar Kantakuzin - a late representative. He was a descendant of the Kantakouzenos family. He wrote in Bulgarian and Greek language. Kantakuzin was author of many works such as Passional and short praising of John of Rila, Geographic description, Epistle to domestikos Isay, poetic works with Christian theme.

Located in Riga, Latvia. It unites more than 80 teams and about 2 400 players in 8 leagues (including 2 oldtimers leagues). History The modern history of amateur ice hockey began in 1996, when Latvian national ice hockey team returned to the top division of the Ice Hockey World Championship. Possibly this fact was very important in the further development of amateur hockey in Latvia. At the end of summer in 1996 a group of enthusiasts decided to unite the unorganised groups of amateur hockey players and organize their 1st ice hockey championship for amateur teams. The tournament was successful - 7 teams took part in it (\\"KrƒÅsainie Lƒìjumi\\", \\"Bauska-Inƒçukalns\\", \\"Tiesne≈°i\\", \\"Ledus Vaboles\\", \\"Vakara Zi≈Üas\\", \\"Balsts\\", RTU). The first season in 1997/1998 started with even more teams - 16 teams in two groups. The first NAHL Championship took place in autumn 1999, where 7 teams participated (\\"Anatta\\", \\"L≈´≈°i\\", \\"Vektor\\", \\"Lattelecom\\", Jaunpils, J≈´rmala, \\"Vikingi-Eglƒ´te\\").

They put the finishing touches to the regulations of competitions and elected the League Council. Independent Amateur Hockey League \\"NAHL\\" has been an officially registered sport public organization since autumn 2001. It provides the hockey competitions not only in Riga, but also in other hockey halls of Latvia. The season 2002/2003 started with 43 teams.

Currently NAHL unites 80 amateur teams, which are divided, according to their level, into 6 leagues, plus 2 old-timer leagues divided into Group –ê (ex-professionals) and –í (amateurs). There are also the Latvian regional teams ‚Äì their numbers are about 200. NAHL competitions take place in 10 ice halls. The league has annually organised the Latvian ice-hockey championship among amateur hockey teams (from September to March), and then ‚Äì the NAHL CUP in April.

Located around 20 km north of Beersheba and covering 33,000 dunams, it falls under the jurisdiction of Bnei Shimon Regional Council. In it had a population of . History The kibbutz was established in 1952 and was initially named Tziklag () after the Biblical city of Ziklag, which was thought to have been located nearby. Originally the founders had been unsure whether to settle in the Negev or Galilee, but accepted a government decision that settling on Tel Halif (Tell el-Khuweilifeh)Carta's Official Guide to Israel and Complete Gazetteer to all Sites in the Holy Land. (3rd edition 1993) Jerusalem, Carta, p.295, in the Negev was more important. After a few years, the kibbutz was renamed Lahav in honour of the Nahal group which established it. Economy The economy of Kibbutz Lahav is based on agriculture (both crops and livestock) and two industrial ventures: a plant for plastic containers (Dolav) owned and operated jointly with the neighboring kibbutz, Dvir, and a meat processing plant. In 1963, Lahav established the Institute for Animal Research with guidance from leading scientists from the Hebrew University's Faculty of Agriculture, which is the only research facility in Israel specializing in raising pigs.Institute for Animal Research , Lahav. According to a 1963 law, pigs can be legally raised in kibbutzim (or more generally on land leased from the state) only for research purposes, but meat from surplus animals may be sold. While all other kibbutzim abandoned pig farming to comply with the 1963 law, Lahav transferred its pig farm to its new organization, the Institute for Animal Research, which continues to supply Lahav's meat processing factory with surplus pigs. Lahav's pork and other meat products are nationally marketed in non-kosher food stores all over Israel, and the Lahav brand is a major competitor to non-kosher meat products of Mizra. The production of pig meat has raised criticism since the Torah prohibits the consumption of pork, which goes against the prevailing narrative of Israel as a \\"Jewish state\\".

This sometimes necessitated driving directly into the surf‚Äîan inconvenience in a stagecoach or wagon, but a real hazard in motorcars, which were far easier to get stuck and were disabled and immobilized by relatively small waves. A persistent rumor claims that the roadbed was made by a man whose brand-new Maxwell car got stuck and was submerged by the incoming tide in the 1920s; however, photographic evidence shows the road was there well before 1920, and Oregon popular historian Ralph Friedman interviewed a stage driver who remembered using it before World War I.

Historically within the county of Glamorgan, it is now situated in the county borough of Caerphilly. In the United Kingdom Census 2001, the population of the Aber Valley was 6,696.Office of National Statistics  Origin of the name  The name derives originally from the name Sangan + suffix ydd, probably meaning \\"the land or territory associated with Sangan\\". The suffix 'ydd' is often used in Welsh, following a personal name, to denote ownership, as in 'Meirionnydd' or 'Eifionydd'. Historically the name has appeared in a number of different forms, including: 'Seinhenit' (c. 1179), 'Seighenith' (c. 1194), 'Seynghenyth' (1271), 'Senghenyth' (1314), 'Seynthenneth' (1476), 'Seignhenith Suptus et Supra Cayach' (1578‚Äì84). Alternatively, the name may be a spelling variant, from 1326, of 'Seint Genith', from Saint Cenydd. The local church and school have taken this name, as has the nearby 20th-century settlement of Trecenydd.  History  Senghenydd was originally a rural farming community, which became industrialised with the discovery of coal in the late 19th century. With the closure of the coal pits in the second half of the twentieth century, most people in the town now commute outside the Aber Valley for employment. Early history According to tradition, St Cennydd built a monastery near the town; this is disputed. It is also claimed that the area Senghennydd was named after him. The son of Cennydd, St Ffili, is said to have built a fort in the area, making the name of Caerphilly (Ffili's Fort in the Welsh language). The town was also a stronghold for the Welsh during the late 11th century. By the 13th century, it remained in Welsh hands and the Welsh chieftain Ifor Bach (hence the name of the local Welsh school in the town). Ifor Bach's great grandson Llewelyn Bren (Llewelyn ap Gruffudd ap Rhys) was the last Welsh lord of Senghenydd, but lost control of his lands after the six-week siege of Caerphilly Castle and a brief battle at Castell Morgraig, a Welsh-built castle at Cefn-Onn (\\"Ash Ridge\\") which was possibly built by the Lords of Senghenydd. It is also reputed that Ifor Bach built a medieval castle on the site that is now occupied by Castell Coch. Llewelyn Bren was later sent as a prisoner first to Brecon and then to the Tower of London along with his family In 1318 Llywelyn became the prisoner of the ruthless Hugh Despenser the younger, one of King Edward's favourites at court ,who had become Lord of Glamorgan in November 1317 and thus the largest land owner in South Wales, and was a great rival of Mortimer. Without the king's direction, he took Llywelyn Bren to Cardiff Castle where he had him hanged, drawn and quartered without a proper trial. After the parts of his body were exhibited in various parts of the county he was buried in the Grey Friars at Cardiff. Llywelyn's lands were seized by Despenser. This action was condemned at the time and later used as example of the Despensers' growing tyranny. Despenser also imprisoned Lleucu and some of her sons in Cardiff. In October 1326, after the successful rebellion led by Roger Mortimer, the Despensers and Edward had further cause to regret their actions in Glamorgan after they were forced to flee there. Edward and the Despensers' attempts to raise troops locally were (understandably) a dismal failure. This led to their capture in November; then Hugh endured the same death he inflicted on Llewelyn when he too was hanged, drawn and quartered. With the overthrow of Edward II, the estates in Senghenydd were restored (11 February 1327) to Llywelyn Bren's sons: Gruffydd, John, Meurig, Roger, William and Llywelyn.

Most members had already a solid musical background, for instance Sepp Ehrensberger had played in the Berliner cult punk rock band called Vorkriegsjugend (1984‚Äì85), and also in Zerst√∂rte Jugend with Tom Schwoll. Yvonne Ducksworth (a Canadian who arrived in Germany in 1983) had previously sung in Combat Not Conform. Before they gave birth to Jingo de Lunch in April 1987, with the help of Steve Hahn (on drums) and Henning Menke (bass), Tom Schwoll (guitar); Ehrensberger (guitar) and Ducksworth (vocals) played together in Manson Youth. Career In 1987 Jingo de Lunch released their debut album Perpetuum Mobile, three months after their first rehearsal. Their second LP, Axe To Grind, was recorded in 1989. With their third album Underdog, they took a new artistic direction and moved away from their underground roots by signing with the major record label, Phonogram Records. Two other albums released were B.Y.E and Deja Voodoo, before they broke up in 1996. Jingo de Lunch were regarded as a forerunner of crossover music: punk, hardcore, hard rock and rock. They toured many times in Europe and played with The Ramones, Bad Brains, Die Toten Hosen and Bad Religion. After they split, Steve Hahn worked as a roadie for Toten Hosen and Beatsteaks. Tom Schwoll, who left the band in 1994, played with many other bands which included Extrabreit, Kumpelbasis, Sin City Circus Ladies', Die Skeptiker and The Subjects. Henning Menke played with Ojo Rojo from 1999 onwards, and he also played with Church Of Confidence, and Die Skeptiker. In 2005 he joined Skew Siskin. Ehrensberger played in various other bands such as like Bad Brians, 'Riff Raff and Bomb Texas. Ducksworth went to live in Arizona, United States from 1996 to 2006, but she did not take part in any band. In 2006, Jingo de Lunch played two reunion shows at the White Trash Fast Food in Berlin. In 2007, they released The Independent Years: a compilation album with songs from their first two albums; plus a cover version of Subhumans' \\"Fuck You\\", and the rare 12 inch \\"Cursed Earth\\". In September 2007, they celebrated their 20th anniversary as a band by touring in various cities of Germany and Italy. In early 2008, Ehrenseberger left the band, and was replaced by Tico Zamora. At the end of 2009, Schwoll and Zamora left the band, and were replaced by Gary Schmalzl. In early 2010, they played six shows in Germany. In October 2010, they released a new album, Land of the Free-ks. Then, they toured Germany and Europe. In September 2011, they released a live album \\"Live in Kreuzberg\\" recorded at the Lido in Kreuzberg (Berlin)on 25 November 2010. In 2012, they had 5 concerts in Germany. They officially broke up in September 2012. Their last show was at the Ruhrpott Rodeo Festival on 26 May 2012.

Initially developed by Charles Herbert Aslin, the county architect for Hertfordshire, the system was used as a model for several other counties, most notably Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire. CLASP's popularity in these coal mining areas was in part because the system permitted fairly straightforward replacement of subsidence damaged sections of building. Characteristics The system utilised prefabricated light gauge steel frames which could be built economically up to a maximum of 4 storeys. The frames were finished in a variety of claddings and their modular nature could be employed to produce architecturally satisfying buildings. Initially developed solely for schools, the system was also used to provide offices and housing. A later development was known as SCOLA (Second Consortium of Local Authorities) and MACE (Metropolitan Architectural Consortium for Education). The cynics' definition of the CLASP acronym, circulating in the 1970s, was \\"collection of loosely assembled steel parts\\". CLASP buildings are also well known for the substantial amount of asbestos used in their construction, mainly asbestos insulation used in structural columns to support the building. There are now campaigns to remove asbestos from existing school buildings, many of which were built through this programme. Examples of use Important examples include many Hertfordshire schools, some of which have since been listed. The system was also used in the construction of the independent St Paul's School, London, designed by Philip Powell and Hidalgo Moya, which was constructed on unstable ground on a former reservoir, and completed in 1968. Other uses of the CLASP system in the 1960s included the buildings of the University of York, designed by architect Andrew Derbyshire between 1961 and 1963, and the Catholic church of St Michael and All Angels (opened in 1968) in Wombwell, South Yorkshire. It is an \\"unusual, possibly unique\\" use of the system in Catholic church design. Wombwell is prone to mining subsidence and the original church on the site was condemned only ten years after it was built. Image:LangwithBblock.JPGLangwith College, University of York.

Image:CLASP Block at Nottinghamshire County Hall.jpgThe CLASP Block at Nottinghamshire County Hall during demolition in March 2017. Railway stations Between the late 1960s and the early 1970s, the CLASP system was implemented by British Rail for the functional simplification of facilities at railway stations. Many stations, particularly in the former Southern Region, had their original station buildings replaced by prefabricated concrete structures. Asbestos in CLASP buildings CLASP buildings fell out of favour in the late-1970s. Budgetary advances and changing architectural tastes made the scheme obsolete, but the troublesome legacy of asbestos still casts a shadow over many public buildings. Around 3,000 CLASP buildings are still in use across Britain, posing real problems for local authorities and dutyholders alike. It can be tempting to disregard CLASP building as a bygone problem, but doing so is incredibly dangerous.

Aortic rupture is a rare, extremely dangerous condition. The most common cause is an abdominal aortic aneurysm that has ruptured spontaneously. Aortic rupture is distinct from aortic dissection, which is a tear through the inner wall of the aorta that can block the flow of blood through the aorta to the heart or abdominal organs. An aortic rupture can be classified according to its cause into one of the following main types: *Traumatic aortic rupture *Aortic rupture secondary to an aortic aneurysmRuptured Aortic Aneurysm at Patient UK. Original Author: Laurence Knott. Current Version: Gurvinder Rull. Peer Reviewer: Hannah Gronow. Last Checked: 16/05/2012 Signs and symptoms Symptoms *Tearing pain, located in the abdomen, flank, groin, or back *Loss of consciousness Signs *Low blood pressure from hypovolemic shock *Fast heart rate *Blue discoloration of the skin *Altered mental status *Bruising of the flank, a sign of retroperitoneal bleeding. *Death Causes The most common cause of aortic rupture is a ruptured aortic aneurysm. Other causes include trauma and iatrogenic (procedure-related) causes. Mechanism The wall of the aorta is an elastic structure which requires integrity. Rupture results from either loss of wall strength to the point at which systemic pressure is greater than wall strength, or external destruction of the wall of the aorta, by a tumor or traumatic means. The bleeding can be retroperitoneal or intraperitoneal, or the rupture can create an aortocaval (between the aorta and inferior vena cava) or aortoenteric (between the aorta and intestine) fistula. Diagnosis The condition is often suspected in patients close to death with abdominal trauma or with relevant risk-factors. Diagnosis may be confirmed by ultrasound or X-ray computed tomography (CT) scan. Prevention Prevention of aortic rupture begins with screening for disease of the aorta. If indicated, treatment with EVAR or open repair of the diseased aorta can limit the risk of aortic rupture. Treatment Aortic ruptures can be repaired surgically via open aortic surgery or using endovascular therapy (EVAR), regardless of cause, just as non-ruptured aortic aneurysms are repaired. An aortic occlusion balloon can be placed to stabilize the patient and prevent further blood loss prior to the induction of anesthesia. Prognosis Mortality from aortic rupture is up to 90%. 65‚Äì75% of patients die before they arrive at hospital and up to 90% die before they reach the operating room.

Born in Harlesden, Middlesex, he was educated at Winchester College and University of London. A member of the Labour Party from 1918, he was a defender of the Soviet Union. In 1932, as part of G. D. H. Cole's New Fabian Research Bureau's 'expert commission of enquiry', he visited the Soviet Union, and, according to Margaret Cole, \\"the eminent KC swallowed it all\\".Contemporary letter to G. D. H. Cole cited in Kevin Morgan, The Webbs and Soviet Communism, London: Lawrence & Wishart, 2006, pg. 77 Pritt was expelled from the Labour Party in March 1940 following his support of the Soviet invasion of Finland. Pritt was characterised by George Orwell as \\"perhaps the most effective pro-Soviet publicist in this country\\". Early life Pritt was born 22 September 1887 in London, the son of a metal merchant.Colin Holmes, \\"Denis Nowell Pritt,\\" in A. Thomas Lane (ed.), Biographical Dictionary of European Labor Leaders: Volume 2: M-Z. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1995; pp. 779-780. Pritt was educated at Winchester College, which he left after four years so as to relocate to Geneva in order to learn French, with a view to joining his father's company. Following his time in Switzerland, Pritt moved again to expand his linguistic knowledge, working in a bank in A Coru√±a, Spain, and mastering his knowledge of Spanish. Pritt also added German to his repertoire of languages in subsequent years. Pritt was admitted to the Middle Temple on 1 May 1906 and was Called to the Bar on 17 November 1909.Williamson, J.B. (1937). The Middle Temple Bench Book. 2nd edition, p.295. He continued to study law in 1909, obtaining a law degree from University of London in 1910. He began his legal practice as a specialist in workmen's compensation cases. He married in July 1914, on the eve of World War I. During the war he joined the postal censorship department in the British War Office. Following the war, Pritt returned to legal practice as a successful lawyer working in the field of commercial law. Political career A Conservative in his earliest years, Pritt moved steadily leftward politically, joining the Liberal Party in 1914 and the Labour Party in 1918. Following a failed 1931 campaign for Parliament as a Labour candidate in Sunderland, Pritt was elected as a Labour Member of Parliament (MP) for Hammersmith North in 1935. Pritt was made a member of the Labour Party's Executive Committee in 1936, remaining in that role for over a year. In 1936, he attended the first Moscow Show Trial, known as the Trial of the Sixteen. He wrote an account of this, The Zinoviev Trial, which largely supported Joseph Stalin and his first purge of the Communist Party. In 1940 he was expelled from the Labour Party for defending the Soviet invasion of Finland.David Caute The Fellow Travellers: Intellectual Friends of Communism, New Haven, NJ & London: Yale University Press, 1988, p.236 His book Must the War Spread? sympathized with the Soviets and led him to be greatly disliked by the Labour Party elite during and after the war.Bill Jones, The Russia Complex: The British Labour Party and the Soviet Union (Manchester University Press, 1977), p. 42 After 1940 he sat as an Independent Labour member, and at the 1945 General Election was re-elected in Hammersmith North under that label gaining a 63% share of the vote against official Labour and Conservative candidates.\\"UK General Election results July 1945\\" , pokliticsresource.net In 1949 he formed the Labour Independent Group with four other fellow travellers, including John Platts-Mills and Konni Zilliacus, who had also been expelled from the Labour Party for pro-Soviet sympathies. At the General Election of 1950, all the members of the Labour Independent Group lost their seats. By this time, Pritt's opposition to the Cold War and NATO had made him an \\"unpopular figure\\" in Britain. Pritt was awarded the 1954 International Stalin Peace Prize and in 1957 became an honorary citizen of Leipzig, which was then in East Germany. East Germany also awarded him the Gold Stern der V√∂lkerfreundschaft (Star of People's Friendship) in October 1965. Legal career As a lawyer, Pritt successfully defended Ho Chi Minh in 1931‚Äì32 against a French request for his extradition from Hong Kong. In 1933, Pritt was chairman of the \\"International Commission of Inquiry into the Clarification of the Reichstag Fire\\", the so-called \\"London Counter-Process\\" to the Leipzig Reichstag Fire Process. In 1942, he initially defended Gordon Cummins] but, due to a technicality, the trial was abandoned and restarted with a new jury and Pritt was replaced by another lawyer. Cummins, a member of the Royal Air Force was known in the press as the Blackout Ripper and was accused of murdering four women, mutilating their bodies and attempting to murder two others. The defence was unsuccessful, a subsequent appeal was dismissed and Cummins was hanged in June 1942. Pritt's most high-profile case, which he lost, was defending the Kapenguria Six, a group of Kenyan political figures accused in 1952 of Mau Mau links (Jomo Kenyatta, Bildad Kaggia, Kung‚Äôu Karumba, Fred Kubai, Paul Ngei and Achieng Oneko). In this case, Pritt worked with a team of Kenyan and other African, Indian and West Indian lawyers including Achhroo Kapila, Dudley Thompson Q.C. and F. R. S. De Souza. Pritt played a significant role in the Fajar trial in May 1954 in Singapore. He was the lead counsel of the University Socialist Club with the assistance of Lee Kuan Yew as the junior counsel and helped the Club to win the case eventually. From 1965 to 1966, he was Professor of Law at the University of Ghana. Death and legacy Pritt died in 1972 at his home in Pamber Heath, Hampshire. Dennis Pritt Road in Nairobi, Kenya is named after him. Pritt is one of those on Orwell's list, a list prepared by George Orwell for the Information Research Department in 1949, after the start of the Cold War. The list was officially published in 2003, but had circulated before then. It listed notable writers and others whom Orwell considered to be sympathetic to the Soviet Union.

The Quantangshi includes over 48,900 poems written by over 2,200 authors. During the Tang dynasty, poetry continued to be an important part of social life at all levels of society. Scholars were required to master poetry for the civil service exams, but the art was theoretically available to everyone.Jing-Schmidt, 256, accessed July 20, 2008 This led to a large record of poetry and poets, a partial record of which survives today. The two most famous poets of the period were Li Bai and Du Fu. Tang poetry has had an ongoing influence on world literature in modern times.  Periodization  A Tang dynasty era copy of the preface to the Lantingji Xu poems composed at the Orchid Pavilion Gathering, originally attributed to Wang Xizhi (303‚Äì361 AD) of the Jin dynasty The periodization scheme employed in this article is the one detailed by the Ming dynasty scholar Gao Bing (1350‚Äì1423) in the preface to his work Tangshi Pinhui, which has enjoyed broad acceptance since his time.Paragraph 3 in Paul W. Kroll \\"Poetry of the T'ang Dynasty\\", chapter 14 in Mair 2001. This system, which unambiguously treats poetry composed during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong (the \\"High Tang\\" period) as being superior in quality to what came before and after, is subjective and evaluative, and often does not reflect the realities of literary history.Paragraph 4 in Paul W. Kroll \\"Poetry of the T'ang Dynasty\\", chapter 14 in Mair 2001.  Forms  The representative form of poetry composed during the Tang dynasty is the shi.Paragraph 1 in Paul W. Kroll \\"Poetry of the T'ang Dynasty\\", chapter 14 in Mair 2001. This contrasts to poetry composed in the earlier Han dynasty and later Song and Yuan dynasties, which are characterized by fu, ci and qu forms, respectively. However, the fu continued to be composed during the Tang dynasty, which also saw the beginnings of the rise of the ci form. Within the shi form, there was a preference for pentasyllabic lines, which had been the dominant metre since the second century C.E., but heptasyllabic lines began to grow in popularity from the eighth century.Paragraph 5 in Paul W. Kroll \\"Poetry of the T'ang Dynasty\\", chapter 14 in Mair 2001. The poems generally consisted of multiple rhyming couplets, with no definite limit on the number of lines but a definite preference for multiples of four lines.  Sources  The Quantangshi (\\"Complete Tang Poems\\") anthology compiled in the early eighteenth century includes over 48,900 poems written by over 2,200 authors.Paragraph 15 in Paul W. Kroll \\"Poetry of the T'ang Dynasty\\", chapter 14 in Mair 2001. The Quantangwen (ÂÖ®ÂîêÊñá, \\"Complete Tang Prose\\"), despite its name, contains more than 1,500 fu and is another widely consulted source for Tang poetry. Despite their names, these sources are not comprehensive, and the manuscripts discovered at Dunhuang in the twentieth century included many shi and some fu, as well as variant readings of poems that were also included in the later anthologies. There are also collections of individual poets' work, which generally can be dated earlier than the Qing anthologies, although few earlier than the eleventh century.Paragraph 16 in Paul W. Kroll \\"Poetry of the T'ang Dynasty\\", chapter 14 in Mair 2001. Only about a hundred Tang poets have such collected editions extant. Another important source is anthologies of poetry compiled during the Tang dynasty, although only thirteen such anthologies survive in full or in part.Paragraph 17 in Paul W. Kroll \\"Poetry of the T'ang Dynasty\\", chapter 14 in Mair 2001. Many records of poetry, as well as other writings, were lost when the Tang capital of Changan was damaged by war in the eighth and ninth centuries, so that while more than 50,000 Tang poems survive (more than any earlier period in Chinese history), this still likely represents only a small portion of the poetry that was actually produced during the period. Many seventh-century poets are reported by the 721 imperial library catalog as having left behind massive volumes of poetry, of which only a tiny portion survives, and there are notable gaps in the poetic ≈ìuvres of even Li Bo and Du Fu, the two most celebrated Tang poets.  The pre-Tang poetic tradition  The poetic tradition inherited by the Tang poets was immense and diverse. By the time of the Tang dynasty, there was already a continuous Chinese body of poetry dating back for over a thousand years. Such works as the Chu Ci and Shijing were major influences on Tang poetry, as were the developments of Han poetry and Jian'an poetry. All of these influenced the Six Dynasties poetry, which in turn helped to inspire the Tang poets. In terms of influences upon the poetry of the early Tang, Burton Watson characterizes the poetry of the Sui and early Tang as \\"a mere continuation of Six Dynasties genres and styles.\\"Watson, 109  History  A poem by Li Bai (701‚Äì762 AD), the only surviving example of Li Bai's calligraphy, housed in the Palace Museum in Beijing. The Tang dynasty was a time of major social and probably linguistic upheavals. Thus, the genre may be divided into several major more-or-less chronological divisions, based on developmental stages or stylistic groupings (sometimes even on personal friendships between poets). It should be remembered that poets may be somewhat arbitrarily assigned to these based on their presumed biographical dates (not always known); furthermore that the lifetimes of poets toward the beginning or end of this period may overlap with the preceding Sui dynasty or the succeeding Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. The chronology of Tang poetry may be divided into four parts: Early Tang, High Tang, Middle Tang, and Late Tang.  Early Tang  In Early Tang (ÂàùÂîê), poets began to develop the foundation what is now considered to be the Tang style of poetry inherited a rich and deep literary and poetic tradition, or several traditions. Early Tang poetry is subdivided into early, middle and late phases. * Some of the initial poets who began to develop what is considered to be the Tang dynasty style of poetry were heavily influenced by the Court Style of the Southern Dynasties (ÂçóÊúùÂÆ´), referring to the Southern Dynasties of the Southern and Northern Dynasties time period (420‚Äì589 CE) that preceded the short-lived Sui dynasty (581‚Äì618 CE). The Southern Dynasty Court (or Palace) poems tended towards an ornate and flowery style and particular vocabulary, partly passed on through continuity of certain governmental individuals who were also poets, during the transition from Sui to Tang. This group includes the emperor Li Shimin, the calligrapher Yu Shinan, Chu Liang (Á¶á‰∫Æ), Li Baiyao, the governmental official Shangguan Yi, and his granddaughter, the governmental official and later imperial consort Shangguan Wan'er. Indeed, there were many others, as this was a culture that placed a great emphasis on literature and poetry, at least for persons in official capacity and their social intimates. * Representative of the middle phase of early Tang were the so-called \\"Four Literary Friends:\\" poets Li Jiao, Su Weidao, Cui Rong, and Du Shenyan. This represents a transitional phase. * In the late phase the poetic style becomes more typical of what is considered as Tang poetry. A major influence was Wang Ji (585‚Äì644) upon the Four Paragons of the Early Tang: Wang Bo, Yang Jiong, Lu Zhaolin, and Luo Binwang. They each preferred to dispense with literary pretensions in favor of authenticity. * Chen Zi'ang (661‚Äì702) is credited with being the great poet who finally brought an end to the Beginning Tang period, casting away the ornate Court style in favor of a hard-hitting, authentic poetry which included political and social commentary (at great risk to himself), and thus leading the way to the greatness that was to come.  High Tang  In High Tang (ÁõõÂîê), sometimes known as Flourishing Tang or Golden Tang, first appear the poets which would come to mind as Tang poets, at least in the United States and Europe. High Tang poetry had numerous schools of thought: * The beginning part of this era, or style-period, include Zhang Jiuling (678‚Äì740), Wang Han, and Wang Wan. There were also the so-called Four Gentlemen of Wuzhong (Âê≥‰∏≠ÂõõÂ£´): He Zhizhang (659‚Äì744), Bao Rong, Zhang Xu (658‚Äì747, also famous as a calligrapher), and Zhang Ruoxu. * The \\"Fields and Gardens Poets Group\\" (Áî∞Âõ≠ËØóÊ¥æ) include Meng Haoran (689 or 691‚Äì740), the famous poet and painter Wang Wei (701‚Äì761), Chu Guangxi (707‚Äì760), Chang Jian, Zu Yong (Á•ñÂíè), Pei Di, Qiwu Qian (Á∂¶ÊØãÊΩú), Qiu Wei (‰∏ò‰∏∫), and others. * The \\"Borders and Frontier Fortress Poets Group\\" () includes Gao Shi (706‚Äì765), Cen Shen (715‚Äì770), Wang Changling (698‚Äì756), Wang Zhihuan, (688‚Äì742) Cui Hao (poet) (about 704‚Äì754) and Li Qi (690‚Äì751). * Li Bai (701‚Äì762) and Du Fu (712‚Äì770) were the two best-known Tang poets. Li Bai and Du Fu both lived to see the Tang Empire shaken by the catastrophic events of the An Lushan Rebellion (755‚Äì763). This had a tremendous impact on their work, though it did not mark the end of Tang Dynasty poetry, which ended with Li Yu in 978.  Middle Tang  The poets of the Middle Tang (‰∏≠Âîê) period also include many of the best known names, and they wrote some very famous poems. This was a time of rebuilding and recovery, but also high taxes, official corruption, and lesser greatness. Li Bo's bold seizing of the old forms and turning them to new and contemporary purposes and Du Fu's development of the formal style of poetry, though hard to equal, and perhaps impossible to surpass, nevertheless provided a firm edifice on which the Middle Tang poets could build. * In the early phase of the Middle Tang period Du Fu's yuefu poetry was extended by poets such as Dai Shulun (Êà¥Âèî‰º¶, 732‚Äì789) who used the opportunity to admonish governmental officials as to their duties toward the suffering common folk. * Others concentrated on developing the Landscape Style Poem (Â±±Ê∞¥ËØó), such as Liu Changqing (ÂàòÈïøÂçø, 709‚Äì780) and Wei Yingwu (Èü¶Â∫îÁâ©, 737‚Äì792). * The Frontier Fortress Style had its continued advocates, representative of whom are Li Yi (ÊùéÁõä) and Lu Lun (Âç¢Á∫∂, 739‚Äì799). * The traditional association between poetry and scholarship was shown by the existence of a group of ten poets (Â§ßÂéÜÂçÅÊâçÂ≠ê), who tended to ignore the woes of the people, preferring to sing and chant their poems in praise of peace, beautiful landscapes and the commendability of seclusion. They are: Qian Qi (Èå¢Ëµ∑, 710‚Äì782), Lu Lun is also a part of this group, Ji Zhongfu (Âêâ‰∏≠Â≠ö), Han Yi (Èü©Áøä), Sikong Shu (Âè∏Á©∫Êõô, 720‚Äì790), Miao Fa‚Äîor Miao Bo ‚Äì (ËãóÁôº/ËãóÂèë), Cui Tong (Â¥îÂ≥í), Geng Hui (ËÄøË´±/ËÄøËÆ≥), Xia Hou Shen (Â§è‰æØÂÆ°), and the poet Li Duan (poet) (ÊùéÁ´Ø, 743‚Äì782). * One of the greatest Tang poets was Bai Juyi (ÁôΩÂ±ÖÊòì, 772‚Äì846), considered the leader of the somewhat angry, bitter, speaking-truth-to-power New Yuefu Movement (Êñ∞Ê®ÇÂ∫úÈÅãÂãï). Among the other poets considered to be part of this movement are Yuan Zhen (ÂÖÉÁ®π, 779‚Äì831), Zhang Ji (Âº†Á±ç, 767‚Äì830), and Wang Jian (ÁéãÂª∫). * Several Tang poets stand out as being to individualistic to really be considered a group, yet sharing a common interest in experimental exploration of the relationship of poetry to words, and pushing the limits thereof; including: Han Yu (Èü©ÊÑà, 768‚Äì824), Meng Jiao (Â≠üÈÉä, 751‚Äì814), Jia Dao (Ë≥àÂ≥∂/Ë¥æÂ≤õ, 779‚Äì843), and Lu Tong (Áõß‰ªù/Âç¢‰ªù, 795‚Äì835). * Two notable poets were Liu Yuxi (ÂàòÁ¶πÈî°, 772‚Äì842) and Liu Zongyuan (Êü≥ÂÆóÂÖÉ, 773‚Äì819). * Another notable poet, the short-lived Li He (ÊùéË¥∫, 790‚Äì816), has been called \\"the Chinese Mallarm√©\\".Paragraph 87 in Paul W. Kroll \\"Poetry of the T'ang Dynasty\\", chapter 14 in Mair 2001.  Late Tang  In the Late Tang (ÊôöÂîê), similarly to how eventually the earlier duo of Li Bo and Du Fu came to be known by the combined name of Li-Du (ÊùéÊùú), so in the twilight of the Late Tang there was the duo of the Little Li-Du (Â∞èÊùéÊùú), referring to Du Mu (803‚Äì852) and Li Shangyin (813‚Äì858). These dual pairs have been considered to typify two divergent poetic streams which existed during each of these two times, the flourishing Tang and the late Tang: * The Late Tang poetry of Du Mu's type tended toward a clear, robust style, often looking back upon the past with sadness, perhaps reflecting the times. The Tang dynasty was falling apart, it was still in existence, but obviously in a state of decline. * The poetry of Li Shangyin's type tended towards the sensuously abstract, dense, allusive, and difficult. Other poets of this style were Wen Tingyun (Ê∏©Â∫≠Á≠†, 812‚Äì870) and Duan Cheng Shi (ÊÆµÊàêÂºè, about 803‚Äì863). These poets have been attracting gaining interest in modern times. * There were also other poets belonging to one or the other of two major schools of the Late Tang. in one school were Luo Yin (ÁæÖÈö±/ÁΩóÈöê, 833‚Äì909), Nie‚Äîor Zhe or She or Ye‚ÄîYizhong (ËÅ∂Â§∑‰∏≠/ËÅÇÂ§∑‰∏≠, 887-884), Du Xunhe (ÊùúËçÄÈπ§), Pi Rixiu (ÁöÆÊó•‰ºë, approximately 834/840‚Äî883), Lu Guimeng (Èô∏ÈæúËíô/ÈôÜÈæüËíô ?-881), and others. In the other group, were Wei Zhuang (Èü¶Â∫Ñ, 836‚Äì910), Sikong Tu (Âè∏Á©∫Âúñ, 837‚Äì908), Zheng Gu (ÈÑ≠Ë∞∑, 849‚Äì911), Han Wo (844-?), and others. During the final twilight of Tang, both schools were prone to a melancholic angst; they varied by whether they tended towards metaphor and allusiveness or a more clear and direct expression.zh.wikipedia \\"ÂîêËØó\\" (most of this section is adapted from there, along with dates from the linked articles on individual poets) * Yu Xuanji was a famous female poet of Late Tang.  Continuation in Southern Tang  After the official fall of the Tang dynasty in 907, some members of its ruling house of Li managed to find refuge in the south of China, where their descendants founded the Southern Tang dynasty in the year 937. This dynasty continued many of the traditions of the former great Tang dynasty, including poetry, until its official fall in 975, when its ruler, Li Yu, was taken into captivity. Importantly for the history of poetry, Li survived another three years as a prisoner of the Song dynasty, and during this time composed some of his best known works. Thus, including this \\"afterglow of the T'ang dynasty\\", the final date for the Tang Poetry era can be considered to be at the death of Li Yu, in 978.Wu, 190 and chapter on Li Yu 211‚Äì221  After the fall of the Tang dynasty  Surviving the turbulent decades of the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms era, Tang poetry was perhaps the major influence on the poetry of the Song dynasty, for example seeing such major poets as Su Shi creating new works based upon matching lines of Du Fu's. This matching style is known from the Late Tang. Pi Rixiu and Lu Guimeng, sometimes known as Pi- Lu, were well known for it: one would write a poem with a certain style and rhyme scheme, then the other would reply with a different poem, but matching the style and with the same rhymes. This allows for subtleties which can only be grasped by matching the poems together. Succeeding eras have seen the popularity of various Tang poets wax and wane. The Qing dynasty saw the publication of the massive compilation of the collected Tang poems, the Quantangshi, as well as the less-scholarly (for example, no textual variants are given), but more popular, Three Hundred Tang Poems. Furthermore, in the Qing dynasty era the imperial civil service examinations the requirement to compose Tang style poetry was restored.Yu, 66 In China, some of the poets, such as Li Bo and Du Fu have never fallen into obscurity; others, such as Li Shangyin, have had modern revivals.  Anthologies  Many collections of Tang poetry have been made, both during the Tang dynasty and subsequently. In the first century of the Tang period several early collections of contemporary poetry were made, some of which survive and some which do not: these early anthologies reflect the imperial court context of the early Tang poetry.Yu, 55‚Äì57 Later anthologies of Tang poetry compiled during the Qing dynasty include both the imperially commissioned Quan Tang shi and the scholar Sun Zhu's own privately compiled Three Hundred Tang Poems. Part of an anthology by Cui Rong, the Zhuying ji also known as the Collection of Precious Glories has been found among the Dunhuang manuscripts, consisting of about one-fifth of the original, with fifty-five poems by thirteen men, first published in the reign of Wu Zetian (655‚Äì683). The book contains poems by Cui Rong (653‚Äì706), Li Jiao (644‚Äì713), Zhang Yue (677‚Äì731), and others.Yu, 56  The 300 Tang Poems  The most popular Tang Poems collection might be the so-called 300 Tang Poems compiled by Qing dynasty scholar Sun Zhu. It is so popular that many poems in it have been adopted by Chinese language text books of China's primary schools and secondary schools. Some of the poems in it are normally regarded as must-recite ones. He said he found the poems in the poetry textbook students that had been using, \\"Poems by A Thousand Writers\\" (Qian- jia-shi), were not carefully selected but a mixture of Tang dynasty poems and Song dynasty poems written in different styles. He also regarded that some poetry works in that book were not very well-written in terms of language skill and rhyme. Therefore, he picked those best and most popular poems from Tang dynasty only and formed this new collection of about 310 poems including poems by the most renowned poets such as Li Bai and Du Fu. These poems are about various topics including friendship, politics, idyllic life and ladies' life, and so on. = Exemplary verse = „ÄäÊóÖÂ§úÊõ∏Êá∑„Äã ÊùúÁî´ Á¥∞ËçâÂæÆÈ¢®Â≤∏ÔºåÂç±Ê™£Áç®Â§úËàü„ÄÇ ÊòüÂûÇÂπ≥ÈáéÈóäÔºåÊúàÊπßÂ§ßÊ±üÊµÅ„ÄÇ ÂêçË±àÊñáÁ´†ËëóÔºåÂÆòÊáâËÄÅÁóÖ‰ºë„ÄÇ È£ÑÈ£Ñ‰ΩïÊâÄ‰ººÔºüÂ§©Âú∞‰∏ÄÊ≤ôÈ∑ó„ÄÇ My Reflection by Night by Du Fu Some scattered grass.

Fletcher (1919) The first twenty characters translate literally as: :\\"fine grass micro- wind shore / dangerous boom [= part of rigging] alone night boat. :stars hanging- down level wild width / moon[-light] surge big river flow.\\"  Translation into western languages  Major translators of Tang poetry into English include Herbert Giles, L. Cranmer-Byng, Archie Barnes, Amy Lowell, Arthur Waley, Witter Bynner, A. C. Graham, Shigeyoshi Obata, Burton Watson, Gary Snyder, David Hinton, Wai-lim Yip, Red Pine (Bill Porter), and Xian Mao. Ezra Pound drew on notes given to him by the widow of Ernest Fenollosa in 1913 to create English poems indirectly through the Japanese, including some Li Bai poems, which were published in his book Cathay. Some popular Western adaptations of Tang poetry include songs like Pink Floyd's \\"Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun\\".http://www.cjvlang.com/Pfloyd/  Characteristics  Tang poetry has certain characteristics. Contextually, the fact that the poems were generally intended to be recited in more-or-less contemporary spoken Chinese (now known as Classical Chinese; or, sometimes, as Literary Chinese, in post-Han dynasty cases) and that the poems were written in Chinese characters are certainly important. Also important are the use of certain typical poetic forms, various common themes, and the surrounding social and natural milieu.  Relationship to Buddhism, Taoism, and Confucianism  The Tang dynasty time was one of religious ferment, which was reflected in the poetry. Many of the poets were religiously devout. Also, at that time religion tended to have an intimate relation with poetry.  Gender studies  There has been some interest in Tang poetry in the field of gender studies. Although most of the poets were men, there were several significant women. Also, many of the men wrote from the viewpoint of a woman, or lovingly of other men. Historically and geographically localized in Tang dynasty China, this is an area which has not escaped interest from the perspective of historical gender roles.

History Panic Room released their debut album Visionary Position in early 2008. In August 2009, it was announced that pre-orders were being taken for their upcoming second studio album Satellite. A UK tour followed through September, October and November 2009 supporting the upcoming release of Satellite. The pre-release version was released in December 2009 with the retail copy released in early 2010. The album was available in a single disc version and also as a special edition with an extra disc entitled 'Little Satellite' containing 4 extra songs recorded at the Satellite sessions. On 28 July 2010 it was announced on the band's website that founding bass player Alun Vaughan had left the band and had been replaced by Yatim Halimi. On 4 March 2013, Paul Davies left the band for personal reasons. Touring commitments were fulfilled with Morpheus Rising guitarist Pete Harwood filling the void left by Davies. Following the culmination of the tour, Swansea musician, Adam O'Sullivan, was drafted in as a session guitarist for the recording of the band's fourth album, entitled \\"Incarnate\\", and the subsequent tour. In 2015, Steve Rothery Band and Mr So&So; guitarist, Dave Foster, appeared onstage with Panic Room as a session player on their Wildfire Tour and also played on their Kickstarter funded acoustic album Essence, before subsequently joining the band as a full member. 'Essence' was released as a single CD album and also as a special edition with a DVD containing 'The Making Of Essence': a documentary film of the production of the album. Following a successful Pledge Campaign the band filmed a special concert on 16 October 2016 at Islington Assembly Hall for a live DVD release. The DVD was produced by award-winning company, Toward Infinity, who have filmed and produced live concert films for Marillion, Jon Lord, Bullet For My Valentine, Lisa Stansfield and Bring Me The Horizon among others. The resulting film was released as 'Screens - Live In London' in 2017 in a single disc version and a double DVD special edition which contained additional performances from the concert, plus rehearsal and soundcheck footage among other extras. The audio of the entire concert was also released as a double CD with the same title as the DVD (a special edition of the double CD was also produced with a 36-page photo booklet of images from the concert). In late 2018 Panic Room announced that both Dave Foster and Yatim Halimi were leaving the band due to pressure of other commitments, but that remaining founder members, Jonathan Edwards, Gavin Griffiths and Anne-Marie Helder were committed to continue making music as Panic Room. Other work Gavin Griffiths performs with former Marillion vocalist Fish, whilst Yatim Halimi and Dave Foster perform with Fish's former bandmate Steve Rothery in the Steve Rothery Band. Panic Room's principle songwriters, Anne-Marie Helder and Jonathan Edwards also write and perform together outside of Panic Room with their acoustic project, Luna Rossa and Helder also records and performs as a solo artist. Dave Foster has also released two solo albums under his own name ('Gravity' and 'Dreamless') and performs this material as The Dave Foster Band. Both Griffiths and Helder have previously been members of Mostly Autumn, with Griffiths' tenure in that band running from 2009 until 2014, and Helder's running from 2007 until 2015, respectively.

Background  More than a thousand historic watercraft of all sizes are still in operation in Europe. Only a small number of them are registered monuments or real museum ships, while nearly all of them have a certain historic or cultural value in the context of maritime or regional history. The wide majority of historic watercraft are owned and operated by private owners, associations, foundations etc. European Maritime Heritage, the European umbrella organization for traditional vessels in operation, decided to develop a code of best practice for the conservation and restoration of such vessels to safeguard the historic value of these vessels and to define minimum methodological standards for any work to be carried out on these vessels. A working group mainly consisting of Arne Gotved, John Robinson and the professional maritime historian Ingo Heidbrink drafted the text of the Charter which was finally adopted by European Maritime Heritage in 2003.  Contents  The Barcelona Charter describes in a few paragraphs how conservation and restoration of traditional ships in operation should be done. The basic principles are developed on the basis of the Charter of Venice and include for example the requirement for proper documentation of all work carried out as well as proper historical background research as a basis for all work to be done. The aim of all paragraphs is to safeguard the particular historic value of a vessel for future generations although the vessel is still in operation and therefore certain safety-regulations of today have to be matched. The original text of the Charter was written in English, but unofficial translations are available for a number of European languages (Catalan, Dutch, French, German and Portuguese). A detailed commentary on all paragraphs of the Charter was developed by the maritime historian Ingo Heidbrink.Ingo Heidbrink (ed.), The Barcelona Charter, European Charter for the Conservation and Restoration of Traditional Ships in Operation.

They are considered a true song cycle, unlike his previous two groups of songs, the Sieben fr√ºhe Lieder of 1908 and the Vier Ges√§nge, Op. 2, of 1910, and they are his first work for orchestra. The postcard texts by contemporary Viennese poet Altenberg recount the stormy but beautiful condition of the soul and the palpable sensations of love and longing.

They are supplied with water by the Dreisam and can be seen along most streets and alleyways in the old city, being one of the city's most famous landmarks. The word B√§chle comes from the German Bach, meaning rivulet, with the Alemannic diminutive ending -le. History First documented in the 13th century, the B√§chle once served as a water supply and were used to help fight fires. In the 19th century they were seen as obsolete, and most of them were covered with iron plates. The B√§chle were seen by many (among them the ADAC) as a traffic hazard due to their original location in the middle of the road, and as a consequence they were moved to the edge of the roads in 1852. It is local superstition that if you accidentally step in the B√§chle, you will marry a Freiburger. The first documented mention of the B√§chle dates back to the year 1220 when Count Egon I of Freiburg gave the Tennenbacherhof monastery permission to use a field which was irrigated by a B√§chle. Another reference to the B√§chle can be found in a document from the year 1238, according to which the Dominicans built a monastery adjoining the city wall inter duas ripas (Lat: between two (river)banks). Several archaeologists deduce from the outcome of excavations that the B√§chle had already been in existence in 1120 when Freiburg was founded, some one hundred years earlier than documented. The city of Freiburg was founded on the site of a previous settlement at the foot of the Schlossberg. The construction of artificial water courses, used to irrigate pastureland, was convenient because of the natural slope on which the settlement was built. Around the year 1180 some street levels in the city were raised by up to three metres (10') with layers of gravel. Unlike in many other settlements this was not done to protect against floods since the riverbed of the Dreisam is significantly lower than the city. It is now believed that the entire system of B√§chle was instead elevated in order to supply newer parts of the city with water. Thus, houses from the first half of the twelfth century are in line with a lower street level and all constructions after 1175 with a higher one. Those aggradations made the ground floor of a lot of houses impassable from the street, so that they were either raised or simply had front doors built at the level of their upper floors - which were then at street level. The amount of newly constructed buildings around 1175 thus surpassing the number expected by natural population growth, presumably also because the aggradations were used to substitute wooden constructions with stone ones. The \\"B√§chle\\" were part of the dual water supply system of Freiburg: The provision of the city with drinking water proved to be difficult, since the ground water is located 12 meters (40') under the ground and the few deeper wells could only last for emergencies. People directed mountain water from the bottom of the Bromberg in the east of Wiehre across Deicheln towards Freiburg and thus injected the urban running fountains. This system was sufficient for the supply of drinking water for the population, but it did not cover the demand of service water for animals outside of the city walls. Therefore, additional water was branched of the Dreisam and drained through the city's artificial waterstreams, called \\"Runze\\". Since for a long time the term \\"Runze\\" was used for both the B√§chle and for canals, it is not possible to properly distinguish the two facilities in historical sources. Ever since their existence the B√§chle transported rainwater out of the town, carrying along all sorts of dirt. In order to be a positive sight at daytime, no ‚Äûsubstances causing offence\\" (‚Äû√Ñrgernis erregende Stoffe\\") were allowed to be disposed of at daytime. Council regulations from the 16th century then forbade the disposal of solid substance in the B√§chle entirely: After their way through the town, the B√§chle were used to irrigate fields. The water was funneled to the fields across the moat by wooden bridges called ‚ÄûK√§hner‚Äú. The ‚Äûused‚Äú B√§chle water increased the value of the fields massively by being a very nutrient-rich fertiliser. The B√§chle floated snow out of the town and hereby extended crop cycles in spring. In case of drought they secured the continuance of the harvest. The B√§chle originally ran down the middle of the road, which can only be seen today in the Market street. They were considered because of the massive increase in the population in the 19th century as an obstacle for the rise in traffic. Between 1840 and 1851 they were laid at the edge of the road, and the majority were covered with wood or iron plates or edged with stone chutes or pipes. It was recorded that the response was negative from some of the population: The Freiburg residents did not want to abandon the B√§chle. New B√§chle were even produced until 1858, for example, in the ‚ÄòRo√ü-‚Äô, ‚ÄòEngel-‚Äô, and ‚ÄòKasernengasse‚Äô (streets), and also the timber market place. For this task, according to the fire safety regulations of 1692, the townsfolk of Oberlinden had to appoint people of their group every year on 1 May who were supplied with studs by the city. For instance, in 1713, prior to the siege by the French army, 46 households were supplied by these. The fire regulations of 1838 again fortified the important role of the B√§chle. It directly requested the fountain craftsmen to \\"instantly adjust the water in fountains and city streams according to the area of the blaze\\". Since this way, there was fire water available directly available at the location of the fire, it wasn't necessary to build up long bucket brigades to the next water standpost anymore. The modernization of the drinking water and water network from 1850 [20] and the production of fire hydrants in the late 19th century meant that the importance of the B√§chle decreased as a source of water to fight fires. However, in the following century they helped to extinguish fires during the British raid on 27 November (Operation Tigerfish), in which parts of the town centre were totally destroyed. Witnesses reported that after the raid, the B√§chle came in handy, because the industrial streams were buried and the water pipes destroyed, therefore deeming the hydrants useless. [21] Without the water from the B√§chle, the area of Oberlinden, the historic department store, the Wentzinger house and other buildings wouldn't have been able to be saved. By November 1945, mayor Wolfgang Hoffmann had already called for the courses of the stream to be cleaned in order to start using the B√§chle again. Because of the cleaning work, the B√§chle often couldn't flow properly, and at times, the B√§chle themselves exacerbated the work. Due to these two factors it took until the beginning of the 1950s for the B√§chle to be able to run again in the rebuilt city. In 1952, the FAC (\\"Freiburger Automobil-Club\\") demanded the removal of these \\"traffic obstacles\\". A visitor in 1956 proposed to attach references of the B√§chle to the place-name signs. At roughly the same time a merchant filed a suit against the town of Freiburg after having driven into a B√§chle in Salzstra√üe and consequently hitting the wall of a house. The lawsuit over the costs of 2360 DM was rejected. A similar thing happened 1964 to a tourist who sued the city after breaking a leg when he tumbled into the B√§chle at Adelhauser Street. He was sentenced to pay a third of the damage himself. This was based upon the fact that the B√§chle should have attracted his attention after a day in the city and that it should \\"so long as somehow possible keep holding on to such a characteristic, beautiful and hygienic quirk as presented by the B√§chle\\". At least, in consequence of the accidents at the end of the 1960s, the city instituted that the bottom plates of the B√§chle, among others the ones in the Salz- and Bertholdstreet, were put higher. In 1973 the city centre of Freiburg was made a pedestrian zone with tram traffic. Since that time the B√§chle didn't pose a significant traffic inconvenience anymore even though some of them actually run parallel to the tram tracks. The B√§chle network between Rempartstra√üe and Martinstor was further enhanced and previously closed B√§chle on Universit√§tstra√üe and Niemensstra√üe were reopened in 1986 following the Innenstadtkonzept 86 (\\"City Centre Concept 86\\"). Near the Neue Messe established in 2000 a B√§chle was planned, but the idea nearly failed for financial reasons. Therefore, citizens and enterprises of Freiburg were appealed to sponsor: 500 DM for one meter (one yard) of that particular B√§chle. Thus even two kilometres (1¬º miles) from the city centre there now is a B√§chle. It is completely independent from the ones in the city centre, however. The current version of the \\"Article for the cleaning of pavements\\" (\\"Gehwegreinigungssatzung\\") issued on 8 March 2007 by the city administration mentions the B√§chle in several passages: In pedestrian and traffic-calmed zones pavements are defined as the lateral areas separated by B√§chle or gutters. B√§chle are to be kept free of snow and rubbish. Infrastructure Far above the old town, at the Kartause's grit channel, a watergate directs water from the Dreisam into the canal. Before being moved to its present-day location in 1852, this water conduit was located below the Sandfangbr√ºcke. Up until the beginning of the 21st century, this watergate had to be operated manually. It was as recently as 2009 that an automatic inlet construction was put into operation. The canal fills a mining tunnel at the bottom of the Schlossberg. This roughly 400 meter (around 1130 feet) long tunnel was partly bricked and partly sculpted into rock. Memorial stones for master builders, master-workmans and mayors of Freiburg can be found there. A historic map implies that the canal was an open stream before the construction of the Vauban's stronghold from 1679 onward. At the same level of the Schwabentor, the water volume is regulated by means of a watergate. That way, 200 liters (according to a different source, 250 liters; about 50 gallons) of water can flow into the B√§chle's network. Thereby it is completely refilled every 8 minutes. Thanks to the difference in altitude between east and west of Freiburg's old town, the B√§chle flow downwards in a north-west direction with a natural base slope of 1¬∞ to 2¬∞. The main distribution happens in Oberlinden. It's also possible to branch off some water in order to water the alte Linde (old lime-tree) from the year 1729. After running through the city, the water flows back into the canals at Predigertor. It is redirected into the Dreisam at the H√∂llentalbahnbr√ºcke and near Lehen. However, some of the canal's water is also flowing from the northern stream course through different streams into the Glotter. Back when the B√§chle were still used for the watering of fields, it was also redirected at the Christoffeltor and the M√∂nchstor over the city walls. The ‚ÄòRunzknecht‚Äô ensures the distribution of water. 142 brass valves [35] help the regulation, through which the water can also be turned off during the cleaning of the B√§chle. Furthermore, there are plugholes on the bases of the B√§chle, which connect the B√§chle water systems with the central sewerage system into which the water drains. 15 overflow thresholds in the sewers or the industrial stream prevent basements being flooded with high levels of water [15]. The responsibility of keeping the streams clean rests on two full-time ‚ÄúB√§chleputzer‚Äù (previously: ‚ÄúBachr√§umer‚Äù) (b√§chle cleaners / Bach clearers) since at least 1789, who are employed by the city administration of Freiburg. Twice a day they clear the B√§chle of rubbish and leaves which also get caught in the B√§chle grills. Furthermore, the so-called ‚ÄúBachabschlag‚Äù takes place annually in autumn and during a weekend in spring, when the water from all of the canals and B√§chle is drained. The ‚ÄúBachabschlag‚Äù is used not only for cleaning but also to check for damage and if necessary, repair. Further reasons for stopping the B√§chle are for example: road works, the Freiburg wine festival and the Carnival/Fasching parade in which H√§str√§ger, (those wearing a Carnival costume) from the ‚ÄúB√§chleputzer‚Äù jester's guild (established in 1935) can be marveled at. Accommodated to the width of each respective street, the B√§chle themselves are each different sizes. The widest B√§chle with a width of around 75 cm (2'6\\") is located near the Schwabentor and the smallest one which is approximately 15 cm (6\\") wide runs through the narrow old city alleys. Over time the shape of the streams has changed: At first the B√§chle were flowing freely in shallow ditches at street level, but in the nineteenth century a sandstone frame was put in to control the flow of the B√§chle. Since the construction in the 19th century the base of the B√§chle was cemented and the lining was made up of granite tiles. Then in the 20th century it changed and remains the same to this day: the bases are paved with granite or Rhine gravel. The Rhine gravel is also used for paving, but is hard to come by. This requires a specially educated paver. The lining of the B√§chle can also be made with Rhine gravel, porphyry or basalt.

In some years, Amphipodae can also be found in the B√§chle. They are known to prevent the growth of algae. Quotes on the B√§chle According to a legend from the Baden region, anybody who accidentally steps into the B√§chle on a visit to Freiburg will inevitably marry a Freiburg citizen. However, this has not come true yet for former chancellor Gerhard Schr√∂der who stepped into the B√§chle on his way to the town hall to the German-French summit in June 2001. Similar structures in different cities Water streams in cities were more common in earlier days, but nowadays Freiburg is one of few cities left to still have them in form of the B√§chle. At the beginning of the 16th century, Antonio de Beatis wrote about Innsbruck that the streets were \\"broad and had a lot of water channels and fountains\\". In Goslar the Gose was already rerouted through the city by 1200 and supplied the population with drinking water. For the sewage there were plastered gutters which could be flooded with fresh water in order to clean them or to help fight fires. Even older drainage ditches from the time between 1000 and 1100 were excavated in an Anglo-Saxon centre below Winchester in the 20th century. In the late 13th century the Brausch in Strasbourg was led through the paved streets to remove sewage. Former town registrar Adolf Poinsignon supposed in the late 19th century that the little streams in the older towns in Alsace at the foot of the Vosges served as a model for the constructions. In the French town of Brian√ßon, which has been reconstructed after a fire by Vauban, one can also find B√§chle. A stream comparable to the B√§chle in Freiburg is to be found in the centre of the wine- growing municipality Gumpoldskirchen in Lower Austria.

IDE has ended poverty for 19 million of the world‚Äôs poorest people by making radically affordable irrigation technology available to farmers through local small-scale entrepreneurs, and opening private sector access to markets for their crops. Early life and education Polak was born in Czechoslovakia. His family fled the country in 1939 when Paul was only six-years-old to escape the Nazis in World War II, arriving in Hamilton, Canada as refugees.Ever Loved Obituary When he was twelve years old, Polak learned that he could make five cents a quart picking strawberries. This sparked his entrepreneurial spirit and he, along with two partners, Morley Leatherdale and Ed Cummins, started a strawberry farm that earned him $700 for two summers‚Äô work. After earning his M.D. degree at the University of Western Ontario in London, Ontario, Canada, Polak worked as an intern at Montreal General Hospital. In 1959, he moved to Denver, Colorado, to do his residency at the University of Colorado Medical Center. Polak received his certification from the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology in 1968.  Career   Psychiatry  Polak had a wide and varying career in medicine, which included a stint as a deputy coroner and as a medical officer in Melrose, Scotland. But his biggest contributions were in the field of psychiatry, which he practiced for 23 years in Colorado. In the late 1960's, Polak headed the Research Department at the Fort Logan Mental Health Center in Denver Colorado. It was while he was working at Fort Logan, that Polak developed a new treatment model he called Social Systems Intervention. Polak, P. Social Systems Intervention, Arch Gen Psychiatry, 1971 Polak, P. Techniques of social systems intervention. Current Psychiatric Therapies, 31 Dec 1971, 12:185-193 The model was based on studies he had done at the Research Department. He wanted to compare the way psychiatrists, patients and their families looked at the problems they were dealing with. To do this, he surveyed patients at Fort Logan, their families and the psychiatrists who were treating them. He found that patients and their families described the issue in the same way, typically ascribing the problem to interpersonal conflicts between members of the family. Not surprisingly, the psychiatrists said the problem was caused by things like unconscious inner conflicts from childhood. To fully investigate how the psychiatrists thought about their patients, he asked the psychiatrists to predict what the patients and their families would say the problem was. It was assumed that, even though psychiatrists might have had a more sophisticated view of the issue, they certainly would have been able to predict what the patient and family would say about the problem. To his surprise, psychiatrists couldn't do it. No matter how hard they tried, they couldn't predict what their own patients would say. This could mean only one thing: psychiatrists weren't actually listening to their patients and were instead basing their treatments on preconceived notions of the problem. Polak, P. (1970). Patterns of discord: Goals of patients, therapists, and community members. Archives of General Psychiatry, 23(3), 277‚Äì283. Polak wondered what would happen if psychiatrists actually listened to their patients and treated the problems they were describing. To figure that out, he founded the Crisis Intervention Unit at Fort Logan. The Crisis unit treatment regime was structured to insure that the therapist were always paying attention to what the patient and their families said. The therapists were required to document the patient and family's description of the problem. They were encouraged to bring the families into the therapy sessions and even work with extended families when it appeared that other relatives were playing a role in the situation. What Polak discovered was that psychiatric problems were often caused by internal stresses in a family situation, and that focusing on those problems and treating the whole family resulted in quick and lasting changes. In addition, Polak observed that the worst thing you could do was admit someone to a hospital. Polak, P. The crisis of admission, Social psychiatry volume 2, pages150‚Äì157(1967) When you did that, the hospital provided a buffer between the patient and family, and once that buffer was in place it was very difficult to remove. The patient and family would become dependent on that buffer to protect themselves from interpersonal conflict and upset emotions. The longer a patient was hospitalized, the more institutionalized they would become and the more difficult the treatment. On the other hand, helping people confront family conflict and deal with the associated emotion, lead to lasting changes that eluded other therapy techniques. Fish, L. Using Social-Systems Techniques on a Crisis Unit, The Journal Of Hospital and Community Psychiatry, Volume 22 Issue 8 August 1971 Pages 252-255 With these insights in mind, Polak went on to found the Southwest Denver Community Mental Health Center in 1971. At the center, he shifted treatment away from hospitals and into the community. The clinic was deliberately structured so it had minimal space for offices and therapy rooms, to push programs out of the clinic and into the community and homes of their clients. Even in situations where the patient needed more intensive care for medical or psychiatric reasons, he created what he called \\"In Patient Alternatives.\\" The clinic would rent rooms in private homes to serve as an alternative to in-patient care. The clinic chose homes with nurturing, supportive families, who had the strengths to handle people dealing with various crises. At the same time, there were no structured activities or programs in the homes to prevent the patients from becoming too attached or dependent on the alternative.

For example, they started a community-corrections program where they worked with inmates to help them make the transition between prison and the community. Polak's ideas have spread around the world and his techniques are widely used, especially in Britain, where it is one of the models used by the UK's National Health Service. It also widely used in Australia. Polak, P., Bridgett C., Social systems intervention and crisis resolution.

Social entrepreneurship  After a trip to Bangladesh, Polak was inspired to use the skills he had honed while working with homeless veterans and mentally ill patients in Denver to help serve the 800 million people living on a dollar a day around the world. Employing the same tactics he pioneered as a psychiatrist, Polak spent time ‚Äúwalking with farmers through their one-acre farms and enjoying a cup of tea with their families, sitting on a stool in front of their thatched-roof mud‚Äìand‚Äìwattle homes‚Äù. = iDE = Based on extended conversations with more than 3,000 small-acreage farmers in developing countries, Polak devised the simple operating principles that formed the foundation for iDE, which he founded in 1982. iDE has helped more than 27 million people who survive on less than a dollar a day to move out of poverty. = D-Rev = In 2007, Polak stepped down as CEO of iDE and co- founded D-Rev with Silicon Valley technologist Kurt Kuhlmann ‚Äúto create a design revolution by enlisting the best designers in the world to develop products and ideas that will benefit the 90% of the people on earth who are poor, in order to help them earn their way out of poverty‚Äù.

Early career Aloni began his career as a painter, establishing the Bugrashov gallery in Tel Aviv, a home for contemporary art, cultural and political events. While living in New York in the 1990s, his work in large- scale art led him to invent a method for advertising on urban architectural structures. Filmmaking Local Angel In 1996, Aloni began making films. His documentary, Local Angel (2002), and his first feature-length fiction, Forgiveness (2006), are both radical interpretations of the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict that have stirred controversy in the Middle East and internationally. Aloni also directed Kashmir: Journey to Freedom (2008), a documentary about the nonviolent movement for liberation and freedom in Jammu and Kashmir that opened in the Berlin International Film Festival. Other films include Left (1996) and Art/Violence (2013), as well as Innocent Criminals (2004), a music video with DAM (band), Palestinian rap group. Aloni was the head cinema coach in the Freedom Theatre of the Jenin Refugee Camp.

His film Junction 48 received the Panorama audience award at the 2016 Berlin Film Festival. Some of Aloni's films have drawn sharp criticism. Jerusalem Post movie critic Hannah Brown wrote of Aloni's film Forgiveness, \\"There isn't an award for the most pretentious and annoying movie ever made, but if there were, I'd put my money on Forgiveness. Writer/director Udi Aloni really does deserve some kind of prize for the energy with which he has melded tired cliches, smug pseudo-intellectualism and humorless far left-wing politics into a single movie.\\" The film Forgiveness (2006), which had its Middle-Eastern premiere in Ramallah, recently stirred up controversy when the Israeli embassy in Paris threatened to withdraw funding from the Israeli Film Festival in Paris (Israelien de Paris) should they open the festival with the film.Israeli Embassy vs. 'Forgiveness', Ynet.com, Merav Yudilovitch, February 28, 2007 Aloni (along with Naomi Klein, John Greyson, and others) was an initiator of the Toronto Declaration, a petition to protest plans to \\"host a celebratory spotlight on Tel Aviv\\" because according to the petitioners doing so constitutes \\"staging a propaganda campaign\\" on behalf of \\"an apartheid regime.\\".Thank you for your support!, Wednesday, September 16, 2009 Writings Aloni's book, What Does a Jew Want?: On Binationalism and Other Specters (Columbia University Press, 2011), includes conversations and comments by French philosopher Alain Badiou, philosophy professor Judith Butler, and philosopher Slavoj ≈Ωi≈æek.What Does a Jew Want?: On Binationalism and Other Specters - Udi Aloni; edited by Slavoj Zizek; conversations and comments by Alain Badiou, Judith Butler, and Slavoj Zizek, Columbia University Press The book spans the fields of theology and psychoanalysis, literature and philosophy.

In Messianic Manifesto for Binationalism, he calls for a radical re-reading of Zionism, stating that \\"Any attempt to resist the Law of the Father as violent Zionist extremism only strengthens him.

Before his stint in the Golden Baseball League, Odom played baseball at Tallahassee Community College and in the minor-league system of the San Francisco Giants. Because of the trade, Odom was known to fans as \\"Bat Man\\", \\"Bat Guy\\" and \\"Bat Boy.\\" Odom left baseball three weeks after the trade, and he died of an accidental drug overdose a few months later. Early life Odom, 6-foot-2, described himself as a \\"lost youth.\\" He was kicked off of his high school baseball team in Roswell, Georgia. He then played two seasons for the Tallahassee Community College baseball team, going 6-1 with a 2.75 ERA in . In , he was drafted in the 44th round by the San Francisco Giants. Career Odom played for the Giants' affiliates Salem Keizer Volcanoes in and , and the Augusta Greenjackets in . He missed most of the 2005 season because of a right elbow injury, having Tommy John surgery in June 2005. He did not play in due to a dislocated left shoulder.

He then signed in May with the Calgary Vipers of the Golden Baseball League, but a mark on his criminal record, a 1999 conviction for aggravated assault when he was a minor, prevented his entry into Canada. The Vipers offered Odom to the Laredo Broncos for a Bronco player, but that player refused to move to Calgary. The Broncos then offered $1000 cash for Odom, but the Vipers felt cash deals made the team appear financially unstable. The teams then came to an agreement on May 20 to exchange Odom for ten Prairie Sticks maple bats, worth a total of $665. In Laredo, they called him \\"Bat man\\", and played the Batman Theme when he took the mound. After a bad outing on June 5 in Amarillo, Texas, the heckling from fans and even an umpire was more than he could handle. Although his following outing in San Angelo on June 10 went well, he decided to leave the team. Death On November 5, 2008 Odom died of an accidental overdose from heroin, methamphetamine, benzylpiperazine and alcohol. It was election night, and Odom's family said that he had gone out partying that night. Dan Shwam, Odom's former Broncos manager, suggests the media and fan response to the trade \\"drove him back to the bottle, that it put him on the road to drugs again.\\" The ten bats that the Vipers received for Odom were never used, and the Vipers planned to auction them off for charity, but Ripley's Believe It or Not! purchased them for $10,000.

It was released in 1970 on Deram.  Background  Songwriter and producer Tony Hiller formed The Brotherhood of Man in 1969 from a selection of session-singers and songwriters. Originally a five-member group (although they became a quartet soon after), they began recording and writing together with the resultant first single \\"Love One Another\\" being released late in the year. The single failed to chart anywhere, but early in 1970, the second single \\"United We Stand\\" became a major hit worldwide. Encouraged by this, the group, with Hiller as producer, began putting together an album. Along with a third single, the hit \\"Where are You Going to My Love\\", United We Stand was released. Despite the last two singles charting in the UK, the album met with little British success when it was released in August.

The only evidence of her existence is the book I Sailed With Pirates by Aleko Lilius, published in 1931., noted in Where she's said to be the most powerful and well-known female pirate leader in Chinese history, rivaled perhaps only by Ching Shih of the previous century. Career She commanded a fleet of some 12 junks in the area of Macao and the South China Sea during the 1920s-30s. Though her fleet was based in the South China Sea, she frequented the East China Sea and sometimes the Sulu Sea near Palawan in the Philippines. Laoi Choi San was one of several pirates that Lilius claims to have traveled with during the late 1920s. Lilius describes her fleet as \\"twelve smooth-bore, medieval-looking cannons onboard, and two rather modern ones. Along the bulwarks of the junk were bolted rows of heavy iron plates\\". Her crew are referred to as ladrones (pirates, robbers) by the Portuguese and, according to Lilius, were \\"all fearsome fellows, muscular bare-chested men who wore wide- brimmed hats and tied red kerchiefs around their necks and heads.\\" Lai Choi San has been referred to as a female \\"Robin Hood\\" figure, however she and her crew were often paid protection money by local merchantsLevy, Daniel S.Two-Gun Cohen.

NWIRP's mission is to promote justice by defending and advancing the rights of immigrants through direct legal services, systemic advocacy, and community education.https://www.nwirp.org/about-nwirp/mission-vision-values/ History Founded in 1984, the project was created to address the legal needs of Central American refugees and others who were able to legalize their status under Amnesty programs. NWIRP has grown significantly in scope and currently serves more than 10,000 low-income immigrants per year from more than 100 countries across Latin America, Asia, the Middle East, Eastern and Western Europe and Africa. Offices NWIRP has four offices in Washington State. The Seattle Office serves immigrant communities in Western Washington. The Granger Office (in the Yakima Valley) and the Wenatchee Office, serve the immigrant communities in Eastern Washington. The fourth office, located in Tacoma, focuses solely on serving the 1575 persons detained at the Northwest Detention Center (owned and operated by the GEO Group).http://www.geogroup.com/maps/locationdetails/52 accessdate=2015-05-28 Areas of Practice NWIRP provides direct representation to individuals who are applying for political asylum, family visas, lawful status under the Violence Against Women Act, and naturalization or citizenship. NWIRP also provides direct representation, defending individuals who are placed in removal proceedings (deportation proceedings). In addition, supported by a grant from the Executive Office for Immigration Review of the U.S. Department of Justice, NWIRP provides legal orientation sessions to all persons detained at the Northwest Detention Center in Tacoma, Washington, who are placed in removal proceedings. Impact Litigation Apart from representing individuals in administrative proceedings, NWIRP also provides direct representation before the federal district courts in Washington State and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. These are impact litigation cases, designed to affect large numbers of people and bring about meaningful social change through setting precedents. NWIRP is co-counsel with the ACLU, Public Counsel and Mental Health Advocacy Services, in Franco-Gonzales, et al. v. Holder, et al., CV 10-02211, in the Central District of California, where the Court granted class certification and issued a permanent injunction, ordering DHS and DOJ to appoint defenders to all detained individuals in Washington, California and Arizona who have a mental illness or disability rendering them incapable of representing themselves in detention or removal proceedings.Franco-Gonzalez v. Holder, 2013 WL 3674492 (C.D.Cal. 2013) The Court initially granted motions for preliminary injunctive relief on behalf of the named plaintiffs.See, e.g., Franco-Gonzales v. Holder, 767 F.Supp.2d 1034 (C.D. Cal 2010)828 F.Supp.2d 1133 (C.D.Cal., May 04, 2011) (orders granting preliminary injunctive relief for named plaintiffs) Thereafter, the court certified a class of similarly situated individuals in Washington, California and Arizona. Finally, the Court granted Plaintiffs‚Äô motion for partial summary judgment, requiring the government to assign qualified legal representatives for class members.Franco- Gonzalez v. Holder, 2013 WL 3674492 (C.D.Cal. 2013) DOJ then announced a plan to provide appointed counsel nationwide to similarly situated individuals. In 2013, NWIRP and the American Immigration Council, along with co-counsel from the Seattle law firm Gibbs Houston Pauw and the Massachusetts Law Reform Institute, successfully concluded a nationwide class action filed on behalf of asylum applicants who were prevented from obtaining employment authorization. The complaint challenged widespread problems with the ‚Äúasylum clock‚Äù- the system government agencies use to determine when immigrants who have applied for asylum may obtain permission to work lawfully in the United States. Ultimately, Defendants agreed to a settlement with the nationwide certified class, which was approved by federal District Judge Jones. A.B.T. v. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, 2013 WL 5913323 (W.D.Wash.) (W.D.Wash. 2013). Among the benefits of the settlement: asylum seekers with Immigration Court cases may now present their asylum applications to the Court immediately, without having to wait months for an initial hearing before an Immigration Judge; certain asylum seekers whose cases have been pending on appeal will now be able to obtain work authorization when the Board of Immigration Appeals remands their case to an Immigration Judge; asylum seekers and their attorneys will be provided with more effective notice so that they do not inadvertently accept hearing dates which frustrate obtaining a work authorization. In addition, even under the ‚Äúexpedited‚Äù process asylum seekers and their attorneys will be provided at least 45 days from the date they file their asylum application in court to prepare for an individual hearing. See EOIR OPPM 13-03, December 2, 2013)(EOIR memorandum implementing policies to comply with A.B.T. settlement). In 2013, NWIRP, again teaming up with the ACLU and co-counsel from the law firm of Gibbs Houston, filed a class action on behalf of persons detained at the Northwest Detention Center in Tacoma, Washington, who had been denied a bond hearing, purportedly pursuant to the mandatory detention statute. The class action successfully challenged the overbroad application of a statute that allows the government to keep persons in removal proceedings locked up without even the opportunity for a bond hearing. On March 11, 2014, Judge Jones,of the federal district court in Western Washington certified the class and granted declaratory relief, ruling that the government did not have the authority to apply ‚Äúmandatory detention‚Äù to the class members. Khoury v. Asher, -- F.Supp.2d --, 2014 WL 954920 (W.D.Wash. 2014) In another far reaching case NWIRP, the ACLU of Washington State and the law firm of Stoel Rives filed a class action in the Western District of Washington challenging the government's obstruction of hundreds of applicants seeking naturalization, all of whom had already passed the necessary exams and demonstrated that they had no disqualifying criminal records. Some of the plaintiffs had applications pending for up to four years. Judge Pechman granted plaintiffs‚Äô motion for class certification.554 F.Supp.2d 1194 (W.D.Wash. 2008) Thereafter she denied Defendants‚Äô motion to dismiss, leading to an eventual settlement where government agreed to complete adjudication of all 450 delayed applications prior to registration deadline for 2008 elections. Roshandel v. Chertoff, 2008 WL 1969646 (W.D.Wash. 2008) Similar litigation was pending throughout the country but this was the first class certified on this issue in the United States. In Roshandel v. Chertoff, the District Court certified the district wide class of applicants for naturalization whose applications had not been timely adjudicated after their interview, as a result of the agency's failure to complete the namecheck. The class covered over 450 applicants whose applications had been indefinitely placed on hold by the government. After the Court's order granting class certification Plaintiffs filed for summary judgment. The government then agreed to settle the case, a settlement which ensured that all applications would be adjudicated in time for the entire class to vote in the November 2008 elections. In addition, NWIRP has successfully represented individuals on several published decisions, including: In Bromfield v. Mukasey, a published decision that received widespread attention, the Court found through the record of proceedings that there is a pattern and practice of persecution against gay men in Jamaica.543 F.3d 1071 (9th Cir. 2008) The EOIR also erred by failing to recognize that the Jamaican government not only acquiesces in the torture of gay men, but is also directly involved in such torture. The Court further clarified that even where a petitioner has been found removable based upon an aggravated felony the Court retains jurisdiction to review claims for withholding of removal and relief under the Convention Against Torture if the denial was based upon the merits of the claim. Other published decisions include: Chay Ixcot v. Holder,646 F.3d 1202, (9th Cir. June 1, 2011). The Court ruled that the agency violated the law by trying to reinstate a prior deportation order rather than first completing adjudication of his pending application for political asylum. The Court ruled that applying the new reinstatement law that was enacted three years after he applied in order to deprive Mr. Chay Ixcot of the right to have his pending asylum application heard would have an unlawful retroactive effect at it ‚Äúwould impair rights a party possessed when he acted.‚Äù Lopez-Birrueta v. Holder, 633 F.3d 1211(9th Cir. 2011). The Court found that the Immigration Judge and Board of Immigration Appeals erred in applying a restrictive interpretation of battery for purposes of establishing eligibility for cancellation of removal for victims of domestic violence. In this case, Ms. Lopez‚Äô children had been beaten with a stick when they were two and three years old. Nonetheless, the Immigration Judge found that since there was no lasting injury it did not demonstrate a heightened level of violence necessary to qualify for relief for victims of domestic violence. The Court swept aside the agency's determination clarifying that there is no requirement for a heightened level of violence. The court also rejected the government's position that the immigration court could consider state-law definitions when determining what is required under this federal law. The Ninth Circuit concluded that the undisputed evidence of physical abuse that M.L.B.‚Äôs children suffered clearly met the standard necessary for protection under VAWA. Franco-Gonzales v. Holder, -- F.Supp.2d --, 2010 WL 5874537 (C.D.Cal. Dec. 27, 2010) The Court granted preliminary injunction for named plaintiffs, finding as a matter of first impression that mentally incompetent plaintiffs were entitled to reasonable accommodation of appointment of counsel, under the Rehabilitation Act and also ruling that Plaintiffs were entitled to a custody hearing. Cortez-Guillen v. Holder, 623 F.3d 933 (9th Cir. 2010). The Court ruled that the agency erred in ordering the petitioner removed. The Court reiterated that the agency is bound by the elements of the crime, even with regards to the realistic probability test. A such, the Alaskan coercion statute does not categorically qualify as aggravated felony crime of violence as it may encompass threats regarding unlawful conduct that are not violent crimes. The petitioner been a lawful permanent resident for almost thirty years. Doissaint v. Mukasey: The Court ruled that the Board of Immigration Appeals (‚ÄúBIA‚Äù) had erred in failing to address the Petitioner's arguments as to eligibility for protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT).538 F.3d 1167 (9th Cir. 2008) The Court also held that the BIA could not try to cure its own error by denying a motion to reopen by the petitioner; Mandujano-Real v. Mukasey: The Court ruled that an identity theft conviction does not qualify as an aggravated felony theft conviction for immigration purposes because the elements of the identity theft statute encompass many forms of conduct that do not fall under the common law definition of theft. The Court also clarified that it was not appropriate to remand the case to the BIA where the BIA's interpretation was not entitled to deference and the BIA had an opportunity to address the issues presented. Finally, the Court reconfirmed that the government may not rely upon an individual's concession of removability that is incorrect as a legal matter;526 F.3d 585 (9th Cir. 2008). Suazo-Perez v. Mukasey: The Court held that the Immigration Judge and Board of Immigration Appeals erred in finding that the petitioner's misdemeanor conviction for assault constituted a crime of violence and thus rendered him deportable despite his lawful permanent resident status;512 F.3d 1222 (9th Cir. 2008) Hosseini v. Gonzales: The Court found that an applicant for relief who has been identified as a supporter of a counterrevolutionary group in Iran qualifies for relief under the Convention Against Torture even where the individual had not experienced past torture;464 F.3d 1018 (9th Cir. 2006) Hernandez-Guadarrama v. Ashcroft: In this case, the Court reaffirmed an often-ignored principle: that the government cannot use statements against non-citizens in removal proceedings without making a reasonable attempt to have the affiants available for cross-examination. This point is especially crucial where the government itself removed the affiants instead of making them available at the removal proceedings;394 F.3d 674 (9th Cir. 2005) Cuevas-Gaspar v. Gonzales: The Court held that a conviction for burglary in the State of Washington does not categorically constitute a crime involving moral turpitude. In addition, the Court ruled the lawful admission and residence of the parents can be imputed to a minor child for purposes of qualifying for cancellation of removal;430 F.3d 1013 (9th Cir. 2005) Perez- Gonzalez v. Ashcroft: The Court found that certain individuals with prior deportation orders are nonetheless entitled to have their applications for adjustment of status to lawful permanent residence along with the necessary waivers adjudicated before the government can moved to reinstate the prior order of removal. The Court held that notwithstanding the prior deportation or removal orders, such individuals are still eligible to become permanent residents. Before Perez-Gonzalez, the vast majority of these individuals were being summarily deported without a hearing and denied the opportunity to become permanent residents;379 F.3d 783 (9th Cir. 2004) Garcia-Lopez v. Ashcroft: The Court ruled that, (1) prior offense of grand theft would not be considered misdemeanor under California statute providing that ‚Äúwobbler‚Äù offense was to be treated as misdemeanor after judgment imposed punishment other than imprisonment in state prison, but (2) California court's declaration that such offense was misdemeanor was binding on BIA;334 F.3d 840 (9th Cir. 2003) Castro-Cortez v. Ashcroft: The Court found that it had jurisdiction to directly review administrative reinstatement orders, and that the provision of Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) permitting INS to reinstate prior orders of removal did not apply retroactively.239 F.3d 1037 (9th Cir. 2001) Other Advocacy Work and Press  Challenging the Use of Border Patrol Agents as \\"Interpreters\\"  NWIRP represented an individual filing a complaint against the U.S.Forest Service, challenging their practice of stopping individuals, and then calling Border Patrol agents to assist. The complaint stemmed from an incident in May 2011 in which a U.S. Forest Service officer called Border Patrol during a routine stop in the Olympic Peninsula, which ultimately resulted in the death of the partner of the complainant. In response, the Department of Agriculture conducted a full investigation and ultimately issued a decision finding that the U.S. Forest Service discriminated against Latinos on the Olympic Peninsula by using Border Patrol agents as interpreters and as law-enforcement support in routine matters.United States Department of Agriculture, Office of the Assistant Secretary of Civil Rights, Program Complaint No. FS-11-5171 The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights, known as OASCR, ordered the Forest Service to make significant policy changes at the national level to remedy its discriminatory policies and practices. In addition, the office directed that additional steps be taken at the Olympic National Forest offices in Washington State. ‚ÄúWe believe this is the first legal ruling addressing the issue of whether the use of Border Patrol agents as interpreters violates civil rights protections and we are pleased that this federal agency has concluded unambiguously that this practice is discriminatory,‚Äù said Jorge L. Bar√≥n, Executive Director of Northwest Immigrant Rights Project. The decision in this case came less than a month after NWIRP filed a separate complaint with the U.S. Departments of Justice and Homeland Security regarding the use of Border Patrol agents for interpretation assistance by other law enforcement agencies throughout Washington State. In response to the complaint and the prior ruling issued by the DOA, DHS then announced a new policy generally prohibiting Border Patrol agents from acting as interpreters for other officials.  Support for LGBT Issues  In June 2011, NWIRP joined immigration and gay rights organizations from around the country in signing Lambda Legal's letter to Secretary Janet Napolitano and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials in urging the Department of Homeland Security to examine cases of abuse against LGBT people and people with HIV/AIDS in immigration detention. The letter also called for standardized guidelines and protocol for the treatment of LGBT people and people with HIV/AIDS while they are in detention, including assigning improper housing to transgender persons, not providing adequate medical treatment for those with HIV/AIDS, denying medications and hormone treatments to transgender persons, and allowing \\"rampant sexual, physical and mental abuse of LGBT detainees.\\"  Denouncement of \\"Secure Communities\\" Program  NWIRP does not support the \\"Secure Communities\\" Program, which would inject local law enforcement into immigration enforcement roles. As of June 2011, several Washington State counties had announced their intention to participate in the program. NWIRP Executive Director Jorge Baron expressed the organization's opinion: ‚ÄúWe believe that ‚ÄòSecure Communities‚Äô will encourage racial profiling practices and further erode immigrant communities‚Äô trust in local law enforcement agencies. As a consequence, victims, witnesses and other immigrant community members will be reticent to approach local law enforcement.‚Äù Partners NWIRP is partnered with several other immigrant rights and law firms in Washington, including Volunteer Advocates for Immigrant Justice (VAIJ), American Immigrant Lawyer's Association (AILA), American Immigration Council (AIC) and the Law Offices of Van Der Hout, Brigagliano & Nightingale, LLP, and the Alliance for Equal Justice. NWIRP also trains law students and pro bono attorneys through the Immigrant Family Advocacy Project at the University of Washington School of Law, and refers cases to them. NWIRP attorneys frequently instruct at a joint NWIRP/UW Immigration Law Clinic designed to serve low- income asylum seekers. NWIRP also refers some domestic violence cases to the Immigration Law Clinic at the Seattle University School of Law.

England (August 18, 1914February 18, 1999), Ancestry.com, Social Security Death index was the principal individual responsible for the transformation of Fort Zachary Taylor from a forgotten eyesore to a popular historic landmark and state park in Key West, Florida. England, a civilian architect/engineer for the Navy in 1968, was born in Key West, Florida. He served in the United States Marine Corps as a Combat Photographer with the Sixth Marine Division on Guadalcanal and Okinawa. After World War II he returned to Key West eventually joining the Navy's Public Works Department as an architect and Base Historian. Fort Zachary Taylor was one of over 40 fortifications built by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers between 1830 and 1866 to guard strategic harbors along the eastern and western coasts of the United States. Construction on Fort Taylor began in 1845 and was completed in 1866. The Fort served as a silent sentinel during the Civil War protecting the harbor at Key West. Fort Zachary Taylor remained Army property until after World War II, when it was turned over to the Navy to be used eventually as a salvage or junk yard. In 1968, England, along with several others was tasked by the Naval Station Commander to investigate the site for possible historic significance. After they found indications that there might be Civil War armaments buried within the Fort, England asked the Navy for permission to further explore the site on a volunteer, after-hours basis. Although the Navy couldn't afford to fund his efforts, the Base Commander approved his proposal. From 1968 to 1973, England spent many hours with his volunteers, whom he called \\"sandhogs\\", digging at the Fort. Because of his discoveries during his time at the Fort, he became recognized as an expert in Civil War Coastal Artillery, called ‚ÄúThe Sherlock Holmes of Fort Taylor‚Äù by a reporter in 1984 . In 1973, England retired from Civil Service with the Navy. This allowed him to devote even more time to exploring and recovering cannons and artifacts until the fall of 1976. England \\"uncovered the largest collection of Civil War armaments in the United States, including cannon, guns, a desalinization plant and thousands of cannon balls and projectiles.\\".Florida Heritage website: The Great Floridians 2000 Program- Key West After the historic significance of the Fort was established, the Navy transferred the property to the Department of the Interior in 1975, which subsequently deeded it to the State of Florida in 1976 to be developed as a State Park. Prior to his transfer to the Florida Park Service, Howard England, in collaboration with Ida Barron,Obituary Notice in the Key West Citizen, Wednesday, July 9, 1986, https://newspaperarchive.com/obituary-clipping- jul-09-1986-948374 wrote and published the first-ever book on the history and re-discovery of Fort Taylor. He titled it: Fort Zachary Taylor: A Sleeping Giant Awakens. It went out of print in 1995. In 2013, his son Edward L. England published a brand new second edition of his father's book. When it sold out in 2015, he updated the second edition and expanded it significantly. Howard England continued his work on the Fort as a temporary employee with the Florida Park Service from October 1976 until October 1978 when he was chosen as the first permanent Park Ranger for the new Park. With further digging and exploration curtailed by the Park Service, England turned his attention to planning for the new Park. He also documented his findings in a series of detailed engineering drawings from which he built some 20 scale models of the principle guns and other features of the Fort as it existed at the end of the Civil War and later when it was modified during the Endicott Period from 1898 ‚Äì 1906. These models and a large number of artifacts and photographs became the contents of what was later called ‚ÄúThe Howard England Museum of Coastal Artillery.‚Äù He also restored two very important field artillery pieces ‚Äì a Model 1905 3-inch Field Howitzer and a Model 1905 Colt Gatling Gun. In 1983, England was recognized by the Director of the Park Service as the first-ever recipient of the Florida Park Service's Distinguished Service Award. He continued as a Park Ranger until August 1984 when he retired at age 70. England continued his research after retirement and discovered how the armaments came to be buried and wrote his memoirs of his work at the Fort. These were published in 2014 as Digging into History: One Man's Journey of Discovery. . England donated a total of 84 of his Architectural and technical drawings of Fort Zachary Taylor 1969-1980 to the Bureau of Archaeological Research, who transferred them to the State Library and Archives of Florida, where they reside today. The balance of his drawings is held at the Bureau of Natural & Cultural Resources‚Äô Collections Facility in Tallahassee. All of Howard England's drawings are available in digital format as .tif or .jpeg files at Fort Zachary Taylor Historic State Park.leftIn 1971, Fort Zachary Taylor was placed on the National Register of Historic Places, designated a National Historic Landmark in 1973 and in 1985, became Fort Zachary Taylor Historic State Park. When he was laying out the Park in the early 1980s, Howard England noted that the southernmost point of the landfill the Corps of Engineers placed around the Fort in 1965 had been eroded into a nice sand beach. Consequently, he incorporated this into his plan and made sure that the park would have the best beach in Key WestFlorida Online Park Guide: Fort Zachary Taylor Historic State Park. Thousands of visitors enjoy the beach and the Fort each year. Howard England died in 1999. The following year he was recognized by the Florida Department of State and Florida League of Cities as a Great Floridian. The Great Floridians 2000 program was designed to recognize individuals who distinguished themselves through their philanthropy, public service or personal or professional service, and who have enhanced the lives of Florida's citizens. His Great Floridian 2000 plaque is located in the Park Manager's Office at Fort Zachary Taylor Historic State Park in Key West.

She began riding BMX bikes during her childhood, as her father owned his own BMX track in Washington. She began competing professionally at age 14 and captured more than 70 BMX wins. In April 2004 she made the switch to full-time mountain bike racing competition. In 2006, Mike King, a former BMX and mountain bike racer, then director of BMX for USA Cycling, urged her to return to BMX riding, and in 2007 she did so, with the added prospect of possibly participating in the 2008 Summer Olympics Jill came out of BMX retirement in early 2007, ostensibly to supplement her mountain cross training. She won her first post-comeback race on her first attempt. Despite a serious knee injury, Kintner continued to pursue success in BMX riding. With the objective of being included in the US BMX team for the 2008 Olympics, Kintner switched to BMX riding full-time. On June 2, 2008, she won a spot on the team after coming in sixth at the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) World Championships held in Taiyuan, China, out of a field of 32 racers, making the top 16. Kintner relocated to San Diego, California, in order to train at the Olympic Training Center, and won the bronze medal in BMX racing at the 2008 Olympics on August 19. Kintner stated it was highly unlikely that she would return for the 2012 Olympics.

This jurisprudence is \\"entirely man-made, written by Muslim scholars according to their various schools, based on their best understanding of how the Qur'an should be translated into codes of law.\\" see Muhammad Sa\`id \`Ashmawi; Carolyn Fluehr-Lobban, Against Islamic Extremism: The Writings of Muhammad Sa'id al-Ashmawy, Gainesville: University Press of Florida, (1998) for \\"one incisive, yet controversial discussion of this issue.\\" Ashmawi believed that instead of referring to legal rules, the term Sharia as used in the Qur'an, refers to \\"the path of Islam\\" which consists \\"of three streams: # worship, # ethical code, # social intercourse.\\" Fiqh is thus not fixed and \\"must be reinterpreted anew\\" by scholars in every age in accordance with their understanding.Ashmawi, Against Islamic Extremism, (1998), p.l91 See also *Islamism *Liberal movements within Islam *Criticism of Islamism *Rifa'a el- Tahtawi *Jamal-al-Din Afghani *Muhammad Abduh *Qasim Amin *Gamal al-Banna *Farag Foda *Ahmed Subhy Mansour References Further reading *Ashmawi, Against Islamic Extremism, (1998), p.l91 *William E.

Founded in 1940, the School of Drama offers a Bachelor's degree and MFA degrees in directing, design, and acting. A Ph.D. in history theory and criticism is also offered. The MFA programs have outstanding reputations as top programs in the country. Each year, the MFA programs admit up to six actors, up to six design students, (two each for costume, scenic design, and lighting), up to three for the Ph.D. program and, every other year, two students are chosen in directing. The School of Drama presents a full subscription season of six productions every academic year, which feature MFA students and undergraduates. The Undergraduate Theater Society (UTS) founded by undergraduate James Newman in 1992, self-produces a season of its own. History The University of Washington School of Drama traces its origins to 1919 when Glenn Hughes, a recent graduate of Stanford University, joined the faculty of the Department of Dramatic Art, a part of the English Department. \\"Hughes, Glenn (1894‚Äì1964).\\" Accessed 2018-01-14. Though he came to the University of Washington as a poetry fellow, Hughes soon became determined to create a first-rate drama school. From 1930 to 1961 Hughes led the Department, which became the School of Drama (SoD) in 1941. He wrote more than 60 plays; wrote and edited various literary and scholarly publications; launched one of the West Coast's first foreign film series; and established the drama program as the center of theatrical life in Seattle. Under Hughes‚Äô leadership, the drama program became a center of Seattle's theatrical life and a respected part of its cultural milieu. In 1961, Hughes retired and was succeeded by Gregory A. Falls. Falls created the Professional Actor Training Program (PATP), a prestigious BFA (now MFA) program that placed the School among the nation's top professional acting conservatories and initiated the Ph.D. program in theatre history, theory and criticism. It was during this time that the stream of UW drama graduates began pooling in Seattle. Graduates and former faculty stayed in the city, founding their own theatres and forming the genesis of what is today one of the country's most active and diverse theatre communities. \\"Does Seattle Have the Country's Best Theater Scene?\\" Accessed 2018-01-14. The School's role in establishing Seattle's vibrant theatre life was seminal. Founders and artistic directors of many of Seattle's leading theatres were first students or faculty at the School of Drama. Falls founded ACT Theatre. Duncan Ross became artistic director of the Seattle Repertory Theatre for over a decade. Alumus M. Burke Walker founded The Empty Space Theatre, which remained in the artistic forefront for over 35 years and former faculty member Arne Zaslove was artistic director for nearly twenty years at the Bathhouse Theatre. Alum Jenny McLauchlan Carlson was co-founder of Seattle Children's Theatre, one of the nation's leading theatres for youth, and alumnae Linda Hartzell spent 32 seasons as its artistic director. The late Ruben Sierra, alumnus and former faculty member, created one of the country's first ethnic theatre companies, The Group Theatre (formerly the Group Theatre at the Ethnic Cultural Center \\"Seattle's Group Theatre Shuts Its Doors.\\" Accessed 2018-01-14.), which was later led by Tim Bond, a directing graduate of the UW who served as associate artistic director at Oregon Shakespeare Festival for 11 years and producing artistic director for Syracuse Stage and who is now Artistic Director of TheatreWorks Silicon Valley. Even the enormously successful Oregon Shakespeare Festival was founded by alum Angus L. Bowmer. \\"Oregon Shakespeare Festival.\\" Accessed 2018-01-14. More recently, the Washington Ensemble Theatre was founded in 2004 by nine alums representing every one of the school's programs. Two years later, Washington Ensemble Theatre was awarded ‚ÄúBest of the Fringe‚Äù by Seattle's alternative newspaper, The Stranger. Other companies founded by recent alums include the The Horse in Motion and Azeotrope theatre companies. Programs  Undergraduate Education (BA)  The Bachelor of Arts in Drama provides a general knowledge of the art of theatre and a foundation for further study or training. The major consists of a program of required courses which introduce students to the core of the art and a selection of elective courses. Majors can also elect to specialize in theatre performance or theatre design. Graduate Education Graduate Education at the School of Drama consists of a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree in theatre history, theory, and criticism and the professional Master of Fine Arts (MFA) degrees in Acting, Directing, and Design. Time after time, these degree programs are nationally recognized as top in their field. Graduate students are taught and advised by an energetic faculty, all of whom regularly work in the professional arena. =Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.)= The Ph.D. program provides comprehensive training in theatre scholarship with a dual emphasis on theatre history and dramatic criticism. The three-year plan of study addresses a full range of Western and Non-Western literature and practice. Through their work with Drama 101 and 201 (the SoD's general humanities courses), Ph.D. candidates gain valuable teaching experience while playing an essential role in the education of majors from every degree program offered by the University. Professor Scott Magelssen is the head of the PhD program. =Professional Director Training Program (MFA)= The Directing Program is a three-year interdisciplinary program designed to equip its students to lead and innovate at the highest levels. The course of study provides students with a wide range of practical training, production experience, and intellectual development. Two candidates are admitted to the program every other year. Nationally recognized director Valerie Curtis-Newton is the head of the directing program. =Design Program (MFA)= The Design Program is a three- year program preparing students for professional careers as scenic, costume and lighting designers. The program fosters individual artistic vision as students grapple with intellectual and aesthetic issues and learn to think critically and creatively. The Design Program requires both theoretical and realized production work, culminating in a thesis production and professional portfolio presentations. Costume designer Deborah Trout is the head of the design program. =Professional Actor Training Program (PATP) (MFA)= The PATP is a three-year conservatory MFA program that prepares students to become top-level professional actors equipped with sensibilities and skills that will serve them throughout their careers. The program promotes the integration of all aspects of performance training. The mission of the program is to develop artists grounded in theatrical tradition who can think for themselves, who are flexible and whose work is honest, powerful and present within the varying demands of theatre, film, and television. Jeffrey Frac√©, an expert in devised theatre and former member of SITI Company, is the head of the PATP.

Elizabeth was the only daughter of Stephen, Duke of Slavonia, a younger son of the Hungarian king Charles I. Her mother was Margaret of Bavaria, and her only known sibling John, Duke of Slavonia (1354‚Äì1360). Elizabeth was regarded as heir presumptive to the throne of Hungary after the death of her brother, as her uncle Louis I had no children. Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor, wanted her to marry his eldest son, Wenceslaus. However, the marriage negotiations were ended in 1370, when a daughter named Catherine was born to Elizabeth's uncle. Catherine was followed by two sisters, which meant that Elizabeth would not inherit the Holy Crown of Hungary. In October 1370, Elizabeth married Philip II, Prince of Taranto, a 41-year-old widower and pretender to the Latin Empire. Philip had survived his children by his previous marriage and was in need of heirs. As her dower, Elizabeth was granted Corfu as a personal fief. Their only known child, a son named Philip, was born in 1371 and died the same year. Elizabeth was widowed on 25 November 1374.

Modern fixatives are usually alcohol based, and hydrocarbon propelled. Certain manufacturers produce fixatives specified for a certain media only, such as soft pastel fixatives. Modern fixatives are elevated in quality in terms of transparency, colourlessness, age-resistance and UV resistance, which prevents yellowing and fading caused by exposure to light. thumb Fixatives are more often than not highly toxic and potential health hazards to the respiratory system, hence should only be used in a well ventilated area. Such fumes may also cause irritation to the eyes. Hydrocarbon contents are also flammable and should not be placed near an open flame or any incandescent sources. Artwork media requiring fixative include drawings done in pencil, charcoal, and pastel. An artist will often fix layers of a work in progress, in order to easily add further layers. Such a technique requires a workable fixative. Fixative is most commonly available in aerosol sprays. Fixative can also come in a liquid form that can be used from the bottle via a manual spray diffuser. This form is better for one's lungs and has less of an impact on the environment.

In Greek their name is Biktoa or Biktoloi. They crossed the Danube with the Marcomanni and Quadi during the reign of Marcus Aurelius (161-180). According to the chapters attributed to \\"Julius Capitolinus\\" in the unreliable Historia Augusta: > . . . now not only were the Victuali and Marcomanni throwing everything into > confusion, but other tribes, who had been driven on by the more distant > barbarians and had retreated before them, were ready to attack Italy if not > peaceably received.Capitolinus, Historia Augusta, Marcus Aurelius, 14:2. They also participated in the Marcomannic Wars, or, as Capitolinus calls it, the \\"German war\\" or \\"war of many nations\\".Capitolinus, Historia Augusta, Marcus Aurelius, 22:1-7, says \\"all the nations banded together against us--the Marcomanni, Varistae, Hermunduri and Quadi, the Suebians, Sarmatians, Lacringes and Buri, these and certain others together with the Victuali, namely, Osi, Bessi, Cobotes, Roxolani, Bastarnae, Alani, Peucini, and finally, the Costoboci.\\" They participated in the barbarian conflict with the Roman Empire in 290, or earlier.

Claudius Mamertinus, in a speech praising Maximian, says of some year shortly after 291 Tervingi, pars alia Gothorum, adiuncta manu Taifalorum, adversum Vandalos Gipedesque concurrunt (\\"Tervingi, another part of the Goths, together with the Taifals, campaigned against the Vandals and Gepids\\"). Given the location of this fighting and the peoples involved, \\"Vandals\\" in this instance is probably an error for Victohali, who are known to have inhabited the region of the Tisza and Somes rivers at this time (from Eutropius). Perhaps the Victohali were a part of the Vandals (Vandili), along with the Lacringi, Asdingi, Silingi, Helvecones, and Nahanarvali. During the reign of Constantius II, the Sarmatian masters (the Arcaragantes) were defeated by their slaves (the Limagantes) during a revolt and fled to the Victohali for protection, as Ammianus Marcellinus writes: > And these native chiefs, losing all their wisdom in their fear, fled to the > Victohali, whose settlements were at a great distance, thinking it better in > the choice of evils to become subject to their protectors than slaves to > their own slaves.Ammianus, Res Gestae Libri XXXI, XVII.xii.19.

At Mississippi Valley State, Cooley coached Jerry Rice, future Pro Football Hall of Fame wide receiver. Early life Cooley was born and Sumrall, Mississippi and raised in Laurel, Mississippi, where he attended Oak Park High School. He played college football at Jackson State University under John Merritt. Cooley graduated in 1962. Coaching career Cooley began his coaching career at Southside High School in Heidelberg, Mississippi, where he worked for seven years. From 1971 to 1973 he was a linebacker and defensive line coach at Alcorn State University. Cooley moved to Tennessee State University in 1974 as a linebacker coach. The success Cooley achieved at Mississippi Valley State is attributed to his design of his innovative \\"Satellite Express\\" passing offense, which was a no huddle offense featuring five wide receivers. Cooley led the Mississippi Valley State Delta Devils to their only Division I-AA playoff appearance in 1984. The 1984 Mississippi Valley State Delta Devils football team set different passing, receiving, and scoring records that featured Jerry Rice and quarterback Willie Totten. To this day, Cooley is the winningest coach in the history of the Delta Devil football program. He also served as an associate professor of physical education at Mississippi Valley State. In 1987 Cooley moved on to University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, which was then an NAIA member before the school moved up to the Southwestern Athletic Conference (SWAC) in the 1990s. He coached there for four years, from 1987 to 1990, and served as athletic director and associate professor. In 1993, Cooley was hired as head coach at Norfolk State University, where he stayed for only one year. After a long hiatus from the coaching scene, Cooley returned when he became head coach at Paul Quinn College located in Dallas, Texas. Paul Quinn was an NAIA member school which was then establishing a new football program, and Cooley was responsible for starting the program from the ground up.

The University of the Andes is not located in a single central campus, but in rather smaller campuses and branches; most of which are scattered across the andean and singularly university city of M√©rida, while the others are located in different states of the country, with their respective library alongside.  History  Coming to life Back in 1785, Bishop Juan Ramos de Lora, a Franciscan clergyman from Seville, opened a Catholic seminary in M√©rida, a remote village in the Andes mountains of what is now Venezuela, under Spanish rule University of the Andes Financial difficulties in the foundation of the Seminary College San Buenaventura and the creation of the University of Merida, 1785‚Äì1810. Ram√≠rez M√©ndez 2006, p.1. - Abstract by then. Once the seminary opened, he gathered and collected many books for its library. It was initially composed of some salvaged antique books which dated back centuries, as far as the Conquista times. It also included many oeuvres from his personal collection and some more from the collaborations and donations of priest friends, ministers and other prominent figures from his episcopate. Hence, the library's first books were comprehensive in canon law, civil law, medicine, philosophy and literature. Regarding the seminary, just a few years after it was founded, local authorities started lobbying to seek the grant of the Spanish government to establish it as a university. The university charter was granted in 1806, but due to the bellicose period in the region it was only validated in 1810 thus the seminary became known as the Real Universidad de San Buenaventura de M√©rida (Saint Bonaventure Royal University of M√©rida), short before the Venezuelan Declaration of Independence. The library slowly but steadily followed the evolution of its sheltering University. Establishment of the University Library Most of Venezuela's 19th century was a troublesome period. It was characterized by political turmoil, autocratic rule and consistent coups d'√©tat which more often than not hindered the evolution of the academia in the country. Nevertheless, in the last decades of the century a steady political stability became foreseeable. In 1883 the Venezuelan government decided to review the law on the higher and scientific national education, in which the country's two existing universities at the time were renamed with their contemporary name; i.e. Universidad de Los Andes for the University of the Andes, and Universidad Central de Venezuela for the Central University of Venezuela in Caracas. With the change of name and policies came a wave of institutional revampment. So, on August 1, 1888\\"[...] en favor del desarrollo de la investigaci√≥n cient√≠fica, fue la creaci√≥n de la Biblioteca de la Universidad, el 1 de agosto de 1888\\". the then Chancellor of the University, Dr. Caracciolo Parra, issued a decree ordaining the following: *The creation of the University Library embedding a scheme of systematized organization. This of course included shelving the whole of the 1,436 antique books acquired since the inception of the Seminary. *The housing of the Library in a building suitable to all of its requirements. *The appointment of Dr. Juan Nepumoceno Monsant as interim Chief Librarian. *The due repair of all damaged and decaying books. *The mandatory donation to the Library of one renowned and useful publication by every former student of the University. The University Library was at last inaugurated on October 27, 1889. By the end of 1894 the Library was counting 1,436 titles and 1,725 volumes. By the turn of the 20th century these figures had bloomed to 2,120 and 2,572 respectively. La Farmacia del Alma: Primera Biblioteca de la Universidad de Los Andes Olmos Rever√≥n, 2002, p.42. Well into the 1900s (decade), the University Library was not any longer the sole library of the institution. Thence it began to be known as the Central Library.\\"A comienzos del siglo XX la Biblioteca de la Universidad se conoce con el nombre de Biblioteca Central [...]\\". It espoused the responsibility of organizing the libraries of the different faculties of the university as they came to existence, and likewise for the training their corresponding personnel. Furthermore, it also conducted the acquisition of all the new resources and equipment for all of the faculty libraries. However, it was the responsibility of every faculty to fund their operation and administration.  The Coming of Age of SERBIULA  In 1977 the libraries of the faculties of Sciences, Economic Sciences, and Engineering, all three located within the same campus, were merged into the Integrated Library of Sciences, Economics and Engineering (BIECI for its acronym in Spanish). This was the first unification of different library services that took place within the University. A project proposal for taking this initiative to a higher level was put forth the University Council a couple of years later. The project submitted the comprehensive integration of all the university's library services into a greater single one. It was swiftly approved on March 6, 1980 and the resulting body was simply named University of Los Andes Library Services (SERBIULA). SERBIULA had and still has the responsibility of integrating all the existing library services and keeping them up-to-date with the University demands. Additionally, SERBIULA created and manages the university's Library System, whose coordination follows a decentralized approach as a consequence of having the University campuses scattered all around the city. Another goal is improving the efficiency of human, technical and financial resources.  Automation of library services with SERBIULA  The automation of library services in the University began with the creation of the aforementioned BIECI library‚Äîcurrently renamed BIACI, but more specifically with the launch of its ICT department (simply known as Inform√°tica). The broad purpose of this department was and still is to imprint ever more efficient, functional, and modern Information retrieval processes to the library services. The early stages of this scheme began with the instalment of the following systems: *Loans control system, *Cataloguing of periodic publications and suppliers control system, *Information retrieval and cataloguing system (use of MARC standards) This early instalment was followed by the development of some middle-stage projects. These projects definitively ignited and set the pace for the continuous ICT updating and upgrading trend for the SERBIULA library services. Among these, the more important were: *The onset of the Document Cataloguing and Editing system (EDICLA), the Automated Information Retrieval System (SARI), and the ULA Loans System (SPULA). *The installation of what would become the first 14 SERBIULA local area networks (development started between 1977 and 1978) *The linking of the university to Internet (1986) \\"Primera Universidad del pa√≠s conectada a Internet\\". First Venezuelan university to be linked to the Internet Rosales & Torrens, 2002; p.4. *The massive incorporation of information to the SERBIULA database (began in 1994). *ULA theses references input to the electronic catalog of SERBIULA (1995).\\"1995: Incorporaci√≥n de referencias de Tesis de la ULA en el cat√°logo electr√≥nico de SERBIULA\\". ULA theses references input to the electronic catalog of SERBIULA Rosales & Torrens, 2002; p.10. *The inclusion of automatic knowledge-based indexing to the library services features. This accumulated know-how resulted in the creation of the ULA Information and Documentation System (SIDULA). It was originally designed to be a comprehensive library management system that would physically centralize all the acquisitions, cataloguing and loans. With the evolution in the University networks, it was ultimately redesigned to work as a client‚Äìserver system. Present-day SERBIULA SERBIULA aims at improving and optimizing all library-related services. In 2000 it established the university's Electronic Information Services (SIE). In 2003 there were two major additions: the creation of the university's Digital Library (Biblioteca Digital), one of the university's main responsible organizations for the on-line dissemination of its historical, cultural, audiovisual, and scientific-academic heritage and production. And secondly, the incorporation to the later of the Index for Venezuelan Science and Technology Journals (REVENCYT) under the SciELO platform.\\"2003 Indice Nacional de Revistas cient√≠ficas Venezolanas Revencyt bajo la metodolog√≠a Scielo\\". REVENCYT incorporation under SciELO Rosales & Torrens, 2002; p.7. 2005 witnessed the development of the open stack library ‚Äìsomehow a novelty in these latitudes, as well as major physical and virtual revamping and upgrading of the whole library network. It was also the year in which SERBIULA embraced LIBRUM\\"Puesta en marcha del nuevo gestor de biblioteca LIBRUM\\".

Biography He was born in Melbourne, to parents who had migrated to Australia from Scotland before he was born. Their names were Edgar Smith and Maggie n√©e Logie, and he appears to have formed his surname by combining his father's name and his mother's maiden name. At age 15 he conducted Handel's Messiah at a local church. He studied piano with Roy Shepherd, a pupil of Alfred Cortot. He won a number of piano competitions and gave recitals. Shepherd was appointed Director of Music at Geelong College in 1936, but had to withdraw within a year due to illness. He persuaded the headmaster, the Rev. Frank (later Sir Francis) Rolland, to appoint the 22-year-old Logie-Smith in his place, despite him having no academic qualifications or teacher training.Illustrated Heritage Guide to the Geelong College. Retrieved 8 June 2014 The college's annual production of Gilbert and Sullivan operas at Geelong's largest cinema, under Logie-Smith's direction, became an event in Geelong's cultural life. In 1948 he took a year's leave from the college to study conducting in England with Sir Adrian Boult and John Barbirolli. In 1958 he was appointed director of music at Scotch College, where he was responsible for greatly expanding both the professional music staff as well as the proportion of boys studying an instrument. The school orchestra reached a standard that was considered close to professional. He led the orchestra on tours of South-East Asia and New Zealand. He also coached football, and led the college's 1st XVIII to a premiership in 1968. At various times, he conducted the Melbourne Youth Symphonic Band, the Astra Chamber Orchestra, the Frankston Symphony Orchestra and the Grainger Wind Symphony, the last of which he founded as Music Director in 1986. He also founded the Astra Choir in 1958. He conducted on a number of LP recordings of music by Australian composers, including a recording of orchestral music with solo parts for saxophone, played by Peter Clinch. One of the Australian pianist Geoffrey Tozer's earliest public performances was in 1964, when aged about 10, with the Astra Chamber Orchestra under Logie-Smith's direction. For some years, he was also the Victorian Universities Schools Examination Board's Chief Examiner of HSC Music A. Honours In 1955 he was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE),It's an Honour: MBE and this was upgraded to Officer (OBE) status in 1971.It's an Honour: OBE His name is perpetuated in the Logie- Smith Auditorium at Geelong College, the George Logie-Smith Foundation at Scotch College, and a music room at Genazzano FCJ College, where he also taught.

It published successfully for over 2 decades and was one of the best known titles in the category. It was a family business run first by the Aumann family and then by the Elmore family. In 2009 it was sold, and the new owner eventually changed the name of the publication to Vintage Tractor Digest. This ended its publication under the Belt Pulley title. History and profile Belt Pulley magazine was founded in 1987 by Kurt Aumann of Nokomis, Illinois. Aumann was only 17 years of age when he first started publishing the magazine. In 1998, Jane Aumann took over primary responsibility for the editing of the magazine as Kurt sought to build his auctioneering business called Aumann Auctions Inc.aumannauctions.com In January 2003, Kurt sold his interest in Belt Pulley magazine to Chad and Katie Elmore of Jefferson, Wisconsin. The Elmores published the magazine for 6 more years. In 2009 they sold it Brandon Pfeiffer of Indiana who in turn sold the publication, which was by then called \\"Vintage Tractor Digest\\" to Brenda Stant of Outrange Farm Publications Inc, Bethlehem, Maryland.Vintage Tractor Digest Facebook page. https://www.facebook.com/VintageTractorDigest  Context of publication: the antique tractor restoration hobby  Although there have been local threshing shows throughout the midwestern United States for many years, the hobby of collecting and restoring old farm machinery began to boom in the 1980s. Organizations of collectors were formed and began to host annual shows for the public. As a result, public interest in old farm tractors and farm machinery grew phenomenally. One such organization that grew tremendously in the 1980s was the LeSueur County Pioneer Power Association of LeSueur, Minnesota. pioneerpowershow.com The interests of individual collectors naturally seemed to crystallize around particular makes of farm tractor, and clubs were formed by collectors of particular brands of tractor manufacturers. The Massey-Harris collectors, the John Deere collectors, and the International Harvester collectors each had their own national organization and newsletter. Accordingly, the magazine called Wild Harvest was dedicated to Massey-Harris tractors and farm machinery, Green magazinegreenmagazine.com and Two Cylindertwocylinder.com magazine were dedicated to John Deere tractors and Red Power was dedicated to International Harvester farm machinery. Because of the need for sufficient members to sustain a viable organization, these antique farm equipment organizations and their respective magazines, were limited only to the products of those farm equipment companies which happened to make farm tractors and, indeed, were further limited to only the major farm tractor manufacturing companies. Overlooked in the literature of the antique farm equipment literature were all the machines made by the various \\"short line\\" companies like the New Holland Machine Company of New Holland, Pennsylvania, the New Idea Spreader Company of Coldwater, Ohio, and the David Bradley Company of Kankakee, Illinois. No formal organizations existed even for those tractors manufactured by the many smaller companies. Into this environment was born the Belt Pulley magazine, with its professed goal, of being dedicated to \\"all brands of antique farm tractors.\\" beltpulley.com  Belt Pulley reporters, contributors, and correspondents  In the first few issues of the Belt Pulley magazine, Kurt Aumann wrote nearly all the articles contained in each issue. If any inclination toward any one brand of tractor or any one antique farm collectors organization could be perceived in the new publication, it would be an inclination toward the products of the Oliver Farm Equipment Company. This was a reflection of the close relationship that Kurt Aumann had developed with individual members of the Hart-Parr/Oliver Collectors Association. Nonetheless, the magazine sought to cover the history and the technical data of all makes and brands of antique farm tractors and farm equipment. Toward this end, the magazine announced its intention of establishing a network of the reporters from around the nation to contribute articles.See the September/October 1987 issue of Belt Pulley magazine, Vol. 1, No. 6, p. 5. Originally, the writers or contributors to Belt Pulley magazine were called \\"Reporters.\\" See the November/December 1987 issue of Belt Pulley magazine, Volume 2 Number 1, p. 2.

The reporters attended antique tractor shows across the nation and submitted \\"show reports\\" to the magazine on the shows they had attended. Humorous reminiscences from Walter M. Buescher, a retired Allis-Chalmers salesman and manager, were featured in a Belt Pulley column for several years.  Ed Westen  Ed Westen became a regular contributor of articles to the Belt Pulley magazine, such as an article on Pioneer Village in Minden, Nebraska,See the March/April 1991 issue of Belt Pulley magazine, Vol. 4, No. 2, p. 14. a two-part series of articles on the restoration of his own Huber Model HK tractor,See the July/August 1991 issue of Belt Pulley magazine, Vol;. 4, No. 4, p. 19 and the September/October 1991 issue, Vol. 4, No. 5. and an article on the Minneapolis-Moline Model D \\"Universal\\" tractor.See the March/April 1992 issue of Belt Pulley magazine, Vol 5, No. 2, p. 15.

Brian Wayne Wells  The longest serving and most prolific writer for the Belt Pulley magazine is Brian Wayne Wells, currently, of Winfield, West Virginia. Starting with the March/April 1994 issue of Belt Pulley, he has contributed an article to every issue of the magazine since that time and has continued to do so down to the present time. His first article carried in that March/April 1994 issue was actually a legal article on the Freedom of Information legislation of the states of Iowa and Wisconsin. As a practising attorney with membership in the bars of Mississippi, Minnesota and West Virginia, Brian was asked by Editor in Chief, Kurt Aumann to write the article, called \\"Researcher's Rights\\" and outlines the proposition that the materials held by various publicly funded archives and libraries is actually the property of the public at large and, thus, the property of the individual researcher. The article points out that restrictions of the use of the content and or copies of these public documents by librarians are not legal restrictions. Since that first article, every other article written by Brian Wayne Wells and Monique Carr has dealt with farming subjects of the past. Generally, his articles fall into three different categories # the history of a particular antique tractor (like the article on the 1938 F-20 owned by Robert Westfall); # the history of a farm equipment company (like the articles on the history of the New Idea Spreader Company of Coldwater, Ohio, the article on the history of the Algoma Foundry and Manufacturing Company of Algoma, Wisconsin and the article on the David Bradley company of Kankakee, Illinois); and # articles which describe the various type of farming conducted around the country (like the article on Sheep Herding in Wyoming,\\" \\"Dry Land Farming in Wyoming,\\" and \\"Navy Bean Faring in Huron County, Michigan.)

It is produced by Slice, and shown on Slice and Discovery Health Channel in Canada and the WE: Women's Entertainment network and Ion Television in the United States. The show is co- hosted by personal trainer Tommy Europe and nutrition specialist Nadeen Boman. Seamstress Jean Okada evaluates how well the brides fit into their wedding gowns. Plot Each episode begins with a bride roughly two months before her wedding day, trying on a wedding dress and finding it does not fit. Europe and Boman offer their assistance to help her shed the pounds necessary. After reviewing the bride's food diary, Boman makes her feel guilty by taking her down the \\"Aisle of Shame\\" which recreates the bride's high-calorie diet. Boman then offers a more healthy diet for the bride to follow. Next, Europe uses a computer simulation to depict what the bride will look like in a few years based on her current diet and activity and the fact that many brides gain a lot of weight during the first few years of marriage. The shocked bride agrees to accept Europe's assistance. Next, the show follows the bride as she strays from her recommended diet. This is followed by a confrontation in which the bride must reaffirm her desire to follow the guidelines set by the hosts. Partway through the weight loss regimen, the bride's measurements are taken, and she tries on her wedding gown. The bride has made some progress, but there is still work to be done. For the final push, Europe enlists the bride's fianc√© to join her and provide support in a run to the top of \\"Cardiac Hill\\". At the end of the show, the bride's measurements are taken, and she tries on her wedding gown one last time. This time, the gown fits perfectly.

It owes its existence to the partition of India in August, 1947. Prior to the partition, the collections of art objects, paintings and sculptures were housed in the Central Museum, Lahore, the then capital of Punjab. After partition, the division of collections took place on April 10, 1948. Sixty percent of objects were retained by Pakistan and forty percent collection fell in the share of India. The museum was inaugurated on 6 May 1968 by Dr. M. S. Randhawa, the then Chief Commissioner of Chandigarh. History The Government Museum and Art Gallery was designed by the Swiss born French architect, Le Corbusier along with his associate architects namely Manmohan Nath Sharma, Pierre Jeanneret and Shiv Dutt Sharma.http://chdmuseum.nic.in/architecture.html The design was completed during the period of 1960-62 and construction took place between 1962 and 1967. It is part of the three museums designed by Le Corbusier, the other two being Sanskar Kendra, in Ahmedabad, and National Museum of Western Art, in Tokyo.  Building  Chandigarh Architecture Museum The building is a museum and art gallery which regularly conducts art acquisition programs for expansion. Envisaged as a vehicle for transmission of knowledge in the Second Five Year Plan and the National Education Policy, it serves as a unique cultural and historical resource for the region. Having significant collection of Gandhara sculptures, Pahari miniature painting and contemporary Indian art, it is regularly visited by tourists, artists, scholars and students. Researchers, architects and scholars on Le Corbusier and Modernization are also frequent visitors to the building and its surrounding. They ensemble to study its architectural values as it represents the series of museums designed by Le Corbusier. The pivoted entrance, metal panelled door, fixed furniture, display systems, exposed concrete sculpturesque gargoyles are symbolic of the prevailing style of Chandigarh's architecture. The mural in the museum reception area executed by one of India's finest contemporary artists, Satish Gujral adds colour to the otherwise stark exposed concrete building. The museum library is a rich repository of books on subjects of art, architecture and history of art. A special section is dedicated to Dr. M. S. Randhawa, containing archival records of his correspondence on the Making of Chandigarh, available to scholars in a digitized version. The adjacent auditorium serves as a lecture hall for extended activities of the museum such as lectures, film screenings and cultural events. The interior detailing of the auditorium represent the Modernist tradition that was introduced in Chandigarh by Le Corbusier. The building is divided into three levels. The first level is 33,000 sq ft comprising the Deputy Curator's office, museum shop, reception, textile section, child art gallery, exhibition hall, reserve collection stores, conservation laboratory and auditorium. Level 2 is 23,000 sq ft and comprises exhibition space for sections on Gandhara sculpture, Indian miniature paintings, stone and metal sculpture, coins and Indian contemporary art. Level 3 is 6,500 sq ft and has the library, Chairman's room, and Gandhara sculptures‚Äô reserve collection store. The museum serves as a means of repository of cultural history of the region. It is open for public from Tuesday to Sunday, from 10:00 AM to 4:40 PM, and is closed on Monday and national holidays. The entry ticket is 10 and camera ticket is 5. It has a free entry for organised school groups and senior citizens. Facilities such as wheel chairs for the physically challenged are also provided. The auditorium is available at low fees for cultural and educational events as it also serves as the exhibition hall for temporary exhibitions to artists.  Collection  Chandigarh Architecture Museum, Chandigarh The beginning of the collection can be traced to the partition of India in 1947 when 40% of the collection of the Central Museum, Lahore became the share of the country. A significant part of this share was the Gandhara sculptures. The collections received in April, 1949 from Pakistan were first housed in Amritsar, then Shimla, Patiala and were finally shifted to Chandigarh upon the inauguration of the museum in 1968. Over a period of time, Dr. M. S. Randhawa added Pahari miniature paintings, modern and Indian contemporary art, so that by the time the collection was displayed in the current building designed by Le Corbusier, it was at par with the leading museums of North India. The collection can be divided into the following categories:  Gandhara sculptures  Bodhisattva Maitreya, c. 2nd century AD, Gandhara Hariti, c. 2nd century AD, Gandhara 228x228px The museum has many different sculptures of Buddha. In some sculptures Buddha has long, open hair, while in some he has a mustache with curled hair lock. In earlier days the followers of Buddha used to worship symbolic representations of Buddha. These representations included representative foot print of Buddha or a Chakra. Later, when the followers wanted to portray Buddha in human form, they portrayed him in a beautiful Greek god-like form. This can be attributed to the Indo-Greek influence in that era.

The College also offers graduate certificates in historic preservation, urban planning, real estate development and urban design. The College is the only accredited architecture program in the state of Utah.  College History  The Department of Architecture was organized in 1949 within the College of Fine Arts, and authorized to grant the Bachelor of Architecture and Master of Architecture degrees. The program received initial NAAB accreditation in 1954, and has been accredited continuously since. Roger Bailey, FAIA, developed the program and served as head of the department from 1949-63. Bailey brought a variety of young faculty members to Utah, including Charles Moore, Gordon Heck, and James Acland. In 1963, Robert L. Bliss, FAIA, was appointed head, and then served as dean from 1974-86. In 1967, in the forefront of many schools of architecture nationally, the school chose to offer the (three year +) Master of Architecture as the primary professional degree. The Bachelor of Architecture degree was discontinued in 1972 and no undergraduate major in architecture was offered. In 1974 the Department of Architecture became a separate academic unit, the Graduate School of Architecture (GSA), operating as a college within the university system. In 1970 the GSA moved into its new building, a fine example of \\"brutalist\\" architecture by the local firm of Edwards and Daniels Architects. This facility continues to successfully house the program. In 1969, through the joint sponsorship of the school and the Utah Society of the American Institute of Architects, ASSIST, Inc., an independent, non-profit community design center was founded. In the early 1970s the school installed its first data processing unit, under the directorship of emeritus professor Edward ‚ÄúTed‚Äù Smith, FAIA, making it among the first schools in the country to begin experimenting with computer applications in architecture. In 1986, Carl Inoway, AIA, was appointed dean, and served until 1992. During this period, the school re-examined its degree offerings, due in part to the length of time it took to complete the program, lack of flexibility for differing student interests, and decreasing enrollments. The decision was made to seek approval to offer an undergraduate pre-professional degree, creating a 4+2 professional degree program to be offered in addition to the existing 3+ professional degree program. William C. Miller, FAIA, was named dean in 1992. The School experienced a significant increase in student numbers from 1990 to 2000, at which time the enrollment was stabilized in both its undergraduate and graduate programs, with pre-professional and graduate majors limited to about 180 students total. Dean Miller also stabilized the funding of the school, in part by successfully instituting differential tuition and program fees, and in part through increases in the firm-sponsored scholarship program. The successful design-build program began in 1999. Dean Miller offered the architecture school a national presence through his activities with ACSA, AIA, NAAB and NCARB. Brenda Case Scheer, FAIA, AICP, was named dean in 2002, and served until 2014. Her tenure has been marked by significant change in the college. Most obvious is the addition of the urban planning program and the subsequent change in name from the Graduate School of Architecture to the College of Architecture + Planning. Coupled with the retirement of several key design faculty members, and the addition of nine new faculty (five in design), this change has had significant impact on the offerings and emphasis in the architecture program and its visibility in the region. During her tenure the Multi-Disciplinary Design Program was created within the School of Architecture. Current Dean Keith Diaz Moore was appointed in 2014 following a national search. Dean Diaz Moore has established the core commitments in the vision of the college including: Responsibility, Respect, Resilience and Response. His unique focus on and ethic of care, empathy, health in the built environment and research in the built environment has allowed the college to address the pressing challenges of the 21st century in society and the environment. As of September 28, 2016 the College has two departments - the School of Architecture and the Department of City and Metropolitan Planning. It also houses the Multi-disciplinary Design program within the School of Architecture. The School of Architecture and Department of City and Metropolitan Planning are the only accredited programs in their discipline in the state. The College has three research centers - the Metropolitan Research Center, Ecological Planning Center and the Integrated Technology in Architecture Center.

In Greek myth In the story the Odyssey, Hermes gave this herb to Odysseus to protect him from Circe's wizardry when he went to her palace to rescue his friends. These friends came together with him from the island Aeolus after they escaped from the Laestrygonians. According to the \\"New History\\" of Ptolemy Hephaestion (according to Photius) and Eustathius, the plant mentioned by Homer grew from the blood of the Giant Picolous killed on Circe's island, by Helios, father and ally of Circe, when the Giant tried to attack Circe. In this description the flower was white, either after the white Sun that killed him, or the fact that Circe grew pale of terror, and a derivation of the name was given, from the \\"hard\\" (Greek malos) combat with the Giant.Rahner, Hugo. Greek Myths and Christian Mystery New York. Biblo & Tannen Publishers. 1971. pg. 204 Homer also describes Moly by saying \\"The root was black, while the flower was as white as milk; the gods call it Moly, Dangerous for a mortal man to pluck from the soil, but not for the deathless gods. All lies within their power\\". So Ovid describes in book 14 of his Metamorphoses - \\"A white bloom with a root of black\\". Assignment to a real species There has been much controversy as to the identification. Philippe Champault decides in favour of the Peganum harmala (of the order Rutaceae), cites: Ph√©niciens et Grecs en Italie d'apr√®s l'Odyss√©e (1906), pp. 504 seq. the Syrian or African rue (Greek ), from the husks of which the vegetable alkaloid harmaline is extracted. The flowers are white with green stripes. Victor B√©rard relying partly on a Semitic root, cites: Victor B√©rard Les Ph√©niciens et l'Odyssee, ii. 288 seq. prefers the Atriplex halimus (atriplex, a Latin form of Greek , and , marine), order Chenopodiaceae, a herb or low shrub common on the south European coasts. These identifications are noticed by R. M. Henry, cites: R. M. Henry Class. Rev. (Dec. 1906), p. 434. who illustrates the Homeric account by passages in the Paris and Leiden magical papyri, and argues that moly is probably a magical name, derived perhaps from Phoenician or Egyptian sources, for a plant which cannot be certainly identified. He shows that the \\"difficulty of pulling up\\" the plant is not a merely physical one, but rather connected with the peculiar powers claimed by magicians. Medical historians have speculated that the transformation to pigs was not intended literally but refers to anticholinergic intoxication. Symptoms include amnesia, hallucinations, and delusions - this description of \\"moly\\" fits the snowdrop, a flower of the region that contains galantamine, which is an anticholinesterase and can therefore counteract anticholinergics. In other works *In Tennyson's The Lotos-Eaters, the moly is coupled with the amaranth (\\"propt on beds of amaranth and moly\\"). *Carl Linnaeus referenced the mythical plant with Allium moly, the scientific name for golden garlic, though the perianth of this species is yellow, not white. * Thom Gunn made his poem 'Moly' the title poem of his 1971 collection.

The school is part of the Kirkwood R-7 School District. Dr. Mike Havener started as principal in July of 2011.  History  Kirkwood High School as an academic institution dates back to 1865, when the Kirkwood School District was founded. A temporary building opened in the fall of 1866; high school and elementary students attended school together. Jefferson Avenue School was the district's first formal school and was built in 1869. The Booker T. Washington School, which opened in 1869 at 430 West Adams Avenue near Geyer Road was built for African-American students to attend. In 1888, the district built the Adams Avenue School next to the Jefferson School, which offered a two-year high school program for White students completing elementary grades. In 1896, Kirkwood offered the first four-year high school program in St. Louis County; 10 students were members of the first graduating class in the spring of 1897. In 1922, a new, four-year high school was built on Kirkwood Road, where Nipher Middle School is currently located. A new Kirkwood High School opened in 1955 on a campus and was designed with seven buildings set on a college-like campus. For the first time in the district, both Caucasian and African-American students were permitted to attend school together. Facilities funded by a 1993 tax/bond issue (Proposition I) included the Thomas N. Keating Performance Center (a fine arts complex with an 821-seat theater), and band, art and vocal music classrooms. The privately funded Walker Commons enclosed the theater lobby area connecting the Center to the main campus. Due to the passage of Proposition I in 2005, a new science building opened in August 2007. The two-story structure measures and features 15 combined science classrooms/laboratories (five each for chemistry, biology and physics). Each classroom/laboratory averages about and was designed to facilitate the movement of students from discussion to hands-on activities. The facility was designed to reflect current research and best practices in science education. The private Kirkwood School District Foundation raised funds to ensure students had the equipment and technology needed to mirror the recommendations in the National Science Foundation report to Congress. Prop I funded the construction of a new regulation-size gymnasium. Renovation of the existing physical education facility was completed in March of 2008. Prop I also funded a variety of infrastructure improvements, including the installation of a new fire alarm, sprinkler system, and a decentralized heating and cooling system. A new football field was finished in 2010, and a new track was finished in 2011. Recognition The 2016 Niche report placed the school as the 2nd best public high school in the state and in the ninety- ninth percentile of the 18,841 public high schools in the country. Regarding college readiness, in 2020 GreatSchools.org gave the school a very high score for its White students but a middling score for its Black students, explaining that large differences between groups suggest that some groups of students may not be getting necessary support. In addition, the report indicated that test scores for low-income students fell below the state average. Kirkwood High school was featured in CNN's ‚ÄúHeroin: The poisoning of America‚Äù and was covered nationally by CNN's Deborah Feyerick. The area of Kirkwood, Missouri was found to have to have four times the national average of heroin overdoses. Allegations of sexual abuse, permissive district culture In July 2020, multiple allegations began to surface on social media of alleged sexual abuse of students by high school and other personnel dating back to at least the 1990s. Allegations came from more than a dozen former high school students. It was also alleged that the district failed to take appropriate measures to address the incidents and prevent recurrences. Criminal investigations into at least two alleged abusers were begun. In August 2020, the board of education approved the hiring of the Kansas City firm Encompass Resolution, LLC to analyze and make recommendations about the district's climate related to the reporting and handling of sexual abuse allegations. Survivors of the alleged abuse expressed concern that the firm's focus is on enacting solutions to address workplace disputes and not on improving school climate related to sexual abuse. On September 9, 2020, a federal lawsuit was filed against the district and a former employee of the high school. The lawsuit alleges federal civil rights and Title IX violations and estimates that more than 25 district employees have been involved in sexual harassment, abuse, or discrimination against students over the previous 40 years. The suit also alleges that the former employee who is named as a defendant committed sexual assault and battery, although no criminal charges have been filed. The plaintiff's attorney states that the broad goal of the lawsuit is to prevent recurrences of sexually inappropriate behavior.  Activities  Boys basketball The program was started by Denver Miller, who coached for 43 years at Kirkwood, earning 790 victories and induction into the Missouri Basketball Hall of Fame. During its history the team has earned 21 district championships and has advanced to the Show-Me Showdown (Missouri's Final Four) eight times.  Football  Kirkwood High School's football tradition dates back over a hundred years. The rivalry between Kirkwood and the nearby high school, Webster Groves High School, culminates every year on Thanksgiving, at their \\"Turkey Day\\" game. In early 2010 construction began to make a new field. After the project was delayed because of the removal of water pipes that were deep in the ground, the first home game on the new Fieldturf was played on October 1. The current head coach of the Kirkwood varsity team is Farrell Shelton. The Kirkwood football team has made it to the State Final Championship game twice, in 2006 and in 2011, and placed second both times. The Kirkwood Pioneers became state champions for the first time in 2012, defeating Fort Osage (Independence, Mo) High School 32-7 to conclude a perfect 13-0 record, a number one ranking in the state of Missouri, and a number seventeen ranking nationally by the USA Today. The Kirkwood Pioneers won their second State Championship in 2016 by defeating Blue Springs High School 31-14. Volleyball Class 4A State Volleyball Champions 1986. High school champions Symphonic Orchestra In 2010, the Kirkwood High School Symphonic Orchestra played at Carnegie Hall in New York City.

In the past, communications service providers (wired communication, wireless, broadband cable, satellite) and other companies competed through product differentiation and price points. By 2005 products were increasingly commoditized and price differences negligible, leaving quality of customer service as the differentiator. (Peppers & Rogers 2005) Customer experience systems are part of service providers' strategies to address this change, as products and prices become increasingly similar. These systems power the front and back office (BSS/OSS) and integrate billing, customer relationship management (CRM), ordering, self service, digital content delivery, service fulfillment and assurance, and computer network planning. (Musico 2008) Software companies that sell these applications, including customer care and billing vendors, and increasingly network equipment providers, can be considered providers of customer experience systems when their offerings are appropriately integrated. The first customer experience systems were introduced by Amdocs.

He was the son of William Stafford of Chebsey, who had been the brother-in-law of Henry VIII of England and the uncle of Elizabeth I. The elder William Stafford's first marriage had been to Mary Boleyn, sister of Anne Boleyn, and Stafford was the child of his second marriage to Dorothy Stafford.. Early life In 1555, William's strongly Protestant family went into exile in Geneva, Switzerland. They were there for nearly two years and were associates with John Calvin who was godfather to William's brother. Following the death of his father, the remaining family moved to Basel, where they lived next door to John Knox. They returned to Waltham, Essex in 1559. William was educated at Winchester College, where he was admitted in 1564, and New College, Oxford, where he matriculated in 1571. In 1573 he was elected a fellow of New College, but two years later he was deprived of his fellowship for being away without leave. He came to London, where his mother was in attendance on Queen Elizabeth. Travel and Espionage In 1585, William went to France secretly, staying in the lodgings of his brother Sir Edward Stafford, ambassador to France, and spying on his own account. When this was found out, he begged Sir Francis Walsingham's intercession with his mother. He soon returned to England.Great Britain.

By 1587, Ch√¢teauneuf was conspiring to poison Queen Elizabeth, using William Stafford's court connections to plant a poisoned gown or saddle for the queen's use. William confessed the plot to Walsingham, who arrested the conspirators. William was released from the Tower in August 1588 without any charges being brought. It is speculated that William was an agent provocateur for Walsingham in this plot; certainly he suffered no lasting harm from the episode.Great Britain.

( Ref: Expeditions Against the Tribes of the Northwest Frontier Province from 1847 to 1908 Compiled and Edited by Stephen Herold *Mukaram Khan Utmankhel : Amongst the forgotten heroes of Pashtuns, comes the name of Mukarram Khan Utmankhel. The name of this brave and fierce leader will be remembered forever in the history as a capable and resistant Pashtun leader. He belongs to the village of Nawi Dhand in Malakand District of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. He spent his entire life fighting against the imperial forces of The British Crown. In 1851, when the British forces firmly held the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the British forces launched a campaign to occupy and allot a piece of land to build a garrison. The area of Gujjar Garhi Mardan was selected as the rally point under the governance of Mr. James. The security of the garrison was given to Subedar Fateh Khan Khattak and his forces. On one of the dark nights, Mukarram Khan and his 200 Utmankhel cavaliers launched an offense from the mountain of Prhang in Nawi Dhand and grounded the camp, slaughtering all the soldiers stationed at that point. Mr. James wasn‚Äôt available at that time in the camp and Subedar Fateh Khan retreated in critical injured condition. After this successful campaign, Mukarram Khan headed back to the Prhang Mountain with his companions. He did his best to create all kinds of hurdles against the forced occupation by the British Imperial forces. After rejecting every single offer given by the British Government, a contingent was sent under the leadership of Sir Collin Ketchell to launch an offensive at Nawi Dhand village. In this battle, Mukarram Khan yet again managed to be praised and appreciated for his valiance and brave actions against the enemy forces. This whole scenario was briefly described and recorded by Sir George Young in his books. (Ref: Gumnam Pakhtoon Hero) *Charsaddah Attack and Brave Utmankhel There were two Arbabs from a village in Peshawar named Khalil , one named Ajun Khan and the other Sardar Khan. Sardar Khan was a youngster while Ajun Khan was a middle aged guy. According to the book, ‚ÄúSulat-eAfghani‚Äù these two were very brave and strong. In 1850 A.D when the Britishers attacked the Khalil area, while on the way to the villages Mathanai and Mechanai these two warriors went to help the warriors from the Mohmand tribe of Pashtuns. When the war ended, then they went to ‚ÄúMathrai‚Äù(which originally was an Utmankhel area), they resided in the areas named, ‚ÄúPrang Ghar‚Äù and ‚ÄúGanderai‚Äù where they started campaigning for war against the Britishers. They prepared tribesmen against the invaders. At that time, warriors from Swat, Buner, Amanzai, Hazara were busy in fighting under the leadership of Syed Akbar Shah Badshah. Ajun Khan and Syed Akbar Shah joined hands and those Khans and Maliks from Ashnaghar, who were residing with Syed Akbar Shah, one of their groups of tribesmen were sent to help Ajun Khan Khalil. Ranezai from Malakand area also joined them and prepared an army and on 2nd April, 1852 A.D. they attacked Charsaddah. A Tehsil Dar who worked for the Britishers was the pioneer of the area, was killed as well as his army. They looted the treasury of the area and returned back to their own area. However, the Britishers got fed up of the simultaneous attacks by the Utmankhel tribesmen. The Britishers regarded Utmankhel tribe as ‚Äúwarlike‚Äù. In May 1952 they declared war against the Utmankhels and attacked ‚ÄúNavi-Dand‚Äù an Utmankhel area of Ghara. Sir George Young Hazard writes that the under the command of Colonel Sir Colon Kejbel, one brigade army troops attacked ‚ÄúNavi- Dand‚Äù(Utmankhel area). This area was regarded as a never defeated and stronghold among all the areas been attacked by the Britishers. This was a gated village surrounded by walls from all sides(fort) where entrance was almost impossible. The Britishers camped at a side of the fort. The war was not yet started that the bulks of war equipments, that belonged to the Britishers, was being brought. With passage of time, the Britishers got enough closed to the fort that they(Utmankhel and Britishers) could see each other. Even they could hear voices of each other. At the meanwhile the tribesmen started attacking the Britishers. Sir Young Hazard presents his views about the scenario in such a way that these warriors came out to attacked on the British camps furiously. These soldiers were exhausted but they strong will and commitment to show and they had no less weapons than that of ours. British Security guards suddenly informed about the attack but it takes time for the soldiers to get equipped but against it, Afghans do attack so vigorously like a strong gale that even a brave hearted man gets afraid. A young British army officer G.N Harding showed courage and saved his army to some extent. Battle ended, but the desire that the Britishers had came with for the battle was that they would conquer the fort of ‚Äúalla-Dand‚Äù was not fulfilled. Then they understood that Agra, Tootai, Meena areas were even more hard even to enter in, their conquer conquer would be only a desire for them. So they camped in Ashnaghar area‚Äôs village, ‚ÄúTangay‚Äù (Ref : Zamung Mujahidin By Abdul Haleem Asar Afghani ) *The Battle of Prang Ghars the British army camped in ‚ÄúTangi‚Äù, they intended to attack on Utmankhel‚Äôs famous central village, ‚ÄúPrang Ghar‚Äù. This village is located at the border of the Ghara‚Äôs Utmankhel tribal area in such a way that it is in front of Asnaghar area at southern part and is near to ‚ÄúAnbar Utmankhel‚Äù and Pindalai‚Äôs Mohmands. The purpose of this attack was to lessen the power of Utmankhels inhabited at the bottom of the hills of ‚ÄúAwaran‚Äù. This attacked was quoted in ‚ÄúSolat-e-Afghani‚Äù in such a way,‚ÄúBritish army brigade accompanied by further 5000 soldiers attacked ‚ÄúTangi‚Äù from the front. In this battle Utmankhel were helped by tribesmen from Rawani tribe of Pashtuns. And some were soldiers from Syed Akbar Shah‚Äôs army who had come here after fighting alongside Ajun Khan Khalil and Sardar Khan Khalil in the battle of Charsaddah. They were around 3000 soldiers.‚ÄùOn may 1852 A.D, the British army attacked under the command of colonel Sir Colon Kejbel aka Lord Clide. The British army attacked one of famous Utmankhel village ‚ÄúMaira‚Äù situated in between two villages named, ‚ÄúGanderai‚Äù and ‚ÄúBazi Kalay‚Äù, from the north. Down the hill, they invaded a famous Utmankhel village, ‚ÄúPraang Ghar‚Äù. The battle continued for a few days. The British army destroyed the village. They returned without entering the routes in the hills. They rather invaded a village named ‚ÄúAbazay‚Äù. This village is situated on the bank of Panjkora river and was the border of Mohamands and Utmankhels, and was on the top of Ashnaghar. They constructed a fort here to secure Ashnaghar area from Utmankhel and Mohmands‚Äô attacks of which they were informed earlier.The Rowani tribe was inhabited in a village named, ‚ÄúGhanderay‚Äù. The British army when returned from Prang Ghar, attacked Ganderay and destroyed the whole village. They arrested the leaders of the tribe. After a few days, the leaders of the Rowani tribe came to the Britishers and granted bail for their leaders. Their application was not accepted. However, colonel Maxen who was the commissioner of Peshawar at that time, signed an indenture from them according to which the people from Ghanderai village should shift into ‚ÄúJalala‚Äù an area in distt: Mardan. 80 families shifted to Jalala.

It is the last surviving of seven Universalist congregations in the city, founded on the belief of universal salvation that emphasized the love of God for all people. Today, the congregation is non-creedal, welcoming a diverse range of religious beliefs and practices. History The congregation began in 1838 as New York City's fourth society devoted to the Universalist faith (the previous three were founded in 1796, 1830 and 1832, respectively). The congregation's original name was Friends of the Final Restitution and in 1848, it changed its name to the Church of the Divine Paternity. It officially took the name of Fourth Universalist Society in the City of New York in 1967. Over the years it has attracted notable personalities such as P. T. Barnum, Horace Greeley, Oscar Hammerstein II, Louise Whitfield Carnegie, Lou Gehrig, and Barbara Gittings to its pews. View from Central Park West In 1898, the congregation built its current home, dubbed \\"the Cathedral of Universalism,\\" at West 76th Street and Central Park West on New York City's Upper West Side. The architect, William Appleton Potter, based the design closely upon Magdalen Tower, Oxford, and buildings at Magdalen College. In 1993 Robert A. M. Stern and his co-authors described the church as \\"one of the few buildings to break from Central Park West's prevailing Classicism.\\"\\"The Fourth Universalist Society of New York\\" The City ReviewRobert A. M. Stern, Gregory Gilmartin and John Massengale, New York 1900, Metropolitan Architecture and Urbanism, 1890-1915 (Rizzoli International Publications) 1993. A rare design in English Perpendicular Gothic, it received praise from notable architects including Frank Lloyd Wright, whose daughter was married at the church. The church houses several significant artistic works, including an altar by Louis Comfort Tiffany, a bronze relief sculpture by Augustus Saint-Gaudens, a mosaic by R. H. Robertson, and stained glass windows by Clayton and Bell of London. The organ was donated by Andrew Carnegie and his wife, Louise Carnegie, the latter who was a member of the church.Fourth Universalist Society: Organ specifications Originally designed and constructed by the Hutchings-Votey Organ Company of Boston, the organ was rebuilt and revised by the Ernest M. Skinner Company. In the 1980s, the congregation received inquiries from developers eager to obtain the church's choice property location. Instead, the congregation joined with community activists, preservationists, and neighbors to form Save Our Universalist Landmark (SOUL) and successfully raised funds for maintenance and capital improvements. In return for these funds, the church promised not to exercise its development rights for a certain number of years, one of the first such agreements of its kind.\\"A Town Without Churches?\\" The Manhattan Institute The congregation is known for its commitment to social justice, notably through its support of environmentalism, the LGBT community, and the Black Lives Matter movement. The church tower, dedicated by the congregation to peace and named \\"The Peace Tower of New York City,\\" is used by NBC each November as its \\"high-tech command center\\" for live coverage of the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.\\"She's Tuned in to Her New Flock\\" New York Daily News On May 1, 2016 the congregation called the Rev. Schuyler Vogel to become its next Senior Minister. In February 2017, the membership voted unanimously to become a sanctuary congregation to protect undocumented immigrants from deportation. Several weeks later, the building was vandalized by swastikas and hate speech, an incident that garnered national media attention.Unity, Instead of Fear, After Swastikas Are Carved Into a Church Door, New York Times, 26 March 2017 In March 2018, the congregation accepted Aura Hernandez into sanctuary, an undocumented mother who had fled an abusive relationship and gang violence in Guatemala.

Early life Not much is known of his early life, but one theory suggests that he was the son of George Boleyn and his wife Jane Parker and thus Elizabeth I's first cousin. However, another theory states that he could not have been their son, as there was no record of children, and was more likely to have been a distant cousin and relative of queen consort Anne Boleyn. Whatever his background, he managed to survive the downfall of Anne Boleyn and her family.  Education  He entered Trinity Hall, Cambridge, in the position of a sizar, November 1544. At Cambridge, Boleyn was a pupil of John Whitgift, afterwards archbishop of Canterbury. In 1552, he graduated B.A. and in 1560 commenced master of arts.  Priestly ministry  On 3 August 1560, he was installed prebendary of Ulleskelf in the church of York; afterwards he became rector of Kempston in Nottinghamshire, and prebendary of the church of Chichester; on 21 December 1566, he was preferred to a canonry of the church of Canterbury, and in the following year graduated B.D. At the proceedings of the metropolitical visitation of the church of Canterbury in September 1573, various charges were laid against Boleyn. It was alleged that he had threatened to nail the dean to the wall; that he had struck one of the canons, William Eling, a blow on the ear; had attempted to strike another canon Dr. Rush; had struck a canon in the chapter-house, and had thrashed a lawyer. It must be granted that Boleyn was of a hasty temper; indeed he frankly admitted that he was accustomed to swear when provoked. But he did not long trouble the peace of the resident canons. On the last day of February 1574-6 he was presented by the dean and chapter of Canterbury to the rectory of St. Dionis Backchurch, London; and on 22 December 1576 he was installed dean of Lichfield, having taken the degree of D.D., as a member of Trinity College, earlier in the same year. He was made prebendary of Dasset Parva on 16 November 1577, but resigned that post in or about February 1578-9. In 1582, he became involved in a lengthy and serious dispute with John Aylmer, the bishop of his diocese. It appears that the bishop, 'being necessitous on his coming into the diocese, laboured all he could to supply himself from his clergy' (Stype's Whitgift, i. 201, ed. 1822). Boleyn, a man 'prudent and stout,' strenuously resisted the aggressive action of the bishop, finally making his appeal to the lords of the privy council, who appointed the archbishop of Canterbury to institute a visitation. In or about August 1592, Boleyn resigned the rectory of St. Dionis Backchurch, and in 1595, after much opposition, was appointed to the rectory of Bangor. He died in January 1602-3, and was buried in Lichfield Cathedral, where there is a monument to him.

It was serialized in Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump from October 1981 to November 1983, and the chapters were published in four tank≈çbon volumes by Shueisha from November 1982 to January 1984. The series was adapted into a 35-episode anime television series by Toei Animation that aired on Fuji Television from May 1983 to January 1984. The story focuses on K≈çsaku Sakamoto, a high school student who goes to live with yakuza boss Ibari ≈åzora and his four children‚ÄîTsugumi, Tsubame, Hibari and Suzume‚Äîafter the death of his mother. K≈çsaku is shocked to learn that Hibari, who looks and behaves as a girl, was assigned male at birth. Eguchi wanted to create a romantic comedy manga where the main female character is a cross-dressing boy so as to poke fun at the genre. He took more time to draw the chapters compared to his earlier manga, and as the serialization continued, he found it increasingly difficult to keep up a weekly pace for the chapters. He eventually abandoned the series after the editor-in-chief of Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump refused his request to release the chapters every other week. From July 2009 to February 2010, Shogakukan published a three-volume Stop!! Hibari-kun! Complete Edition omnibus collection, which features various revisions to the originally published chapters in addition to newly drawn cover art. Stop!! Hibari-kun! has been described as achieving a dizzying reality with Hibari by contrasting a girlish exterior with a male interior. The series has been praised for its overall light and pop literary style, and the delicate touch in how Hibari is drawn has been described as so attractive that it makes the reader forget that it is a gag manga. However, the jokes surrounding the yakuza characters have been criticized as extreme and no longer humorous in modern times. The series has also been described as having had a hand in paving the way for the J-pop phenomenon. Plot Stop!! Hibari-kun! follows K≈çsaku Sakamoto, a high school student whose mother tells him on her deathbed to live with her friend and yakuza boss Ibari ≈åzora and his family in Tokyo after she dies. Although K≈çsaku is initially unsure about his situation, he is relieved when he meets Ibari's four children: Tsugumi, Tsubame, Hibari and Suzume. K≈çsaku is attracted to Hibari from the start, but he is shocked to learn that Hibari, who looks and behaves as a girl, was assigned male at birth‚Äîsomething only known within the ≈åzora Group and Hibari's family. A group of four girls led by Kaori Hanazono begin to suspect that Hibari may be a guy, but Tsubame takes Hibari's place during a health checkup, effectively quelling any suspicions. Hibari begins to show an immediate interest in K≈çsaku, so in an effort to distance himself from Hibari, K≈çsaku joins the Wakaba Academy boxing club. Also in the club is Makoto Shiina, who is attracted to Hibari, and Rie Kawai, the club manager who K≈çsaku likes. Hibari soon joins the club as its second manager shortly before they go on a training camp in Kuj≈´kuri at the end of the year. At the start of the new school year, Hibari is scouted to join the girls' volleyball team after the captain, Jun ≈åtori, witnesses Hibari's athletic prowess. Although Hibari refuses, Jun continues to pursue Hibari until Jun is overwhelmed by Hibari's superhuman ability to spike the ball. After Kaori and her friends try to embarrass Hibari during swim class, they once again suspect that Hibari may be a guy, but Hibari prevents them from getting any proof during the school sponsored summer camp. After Hibari refuses several advances from a popular guy at school named Takuto Honda, Hibari starts openly flirting with K≈çsaku at school. Shiina becomes enraged at K≈çsaku for earning Hibari's affection, but Shiina and K≈çsaku grow closer as friends after they fight it out and K≈çsaku reassures him that there is nothing going on between him and Hibari. When K≈çsaku is out jogging one day, he helps out a girl named Sayuri K≈çenji who was being harassed by three guys from the Kokury≈´ High School boxing club, although Hibari deals with them before K≈çsaku can do anything. Despite this, Sayuri is instantly enamored by K≈çsaku and hires a detective to find out more about him, leading her to discover Hibari's secret. Hibari has another run-in with the Kokury≈´ boxing club members after they harass Tsubame at a festival. The Kokury≈´ boxing club challenges the Wakaba boxing club to some inter-school matches, but this turns out to be a ruse to get a chance to gang up on Hibari. However, the ≈åzora Group intercedes, allowing Hibari to knock out the Kokury≈´ boxing club's leader. Sayuri transfers into K≈çsaku's class, and she blackmails him into going on a date with her in exchange for not revealing Hibari's secret. During the school festival, K≈çsaku's class acts out a Sleeping Beauty play with K≈çsaku as the prince and Hibari as the princess, culminating in Hibari giving K≈çsaku a French kiss on stage. Ibari agrees to look after Gekijir≈ç Taiga, the son of one of his close friends, who K≈çsaku is surprised to learn is a trans man. Characters * is the protagonist of Stop!! Hibari-kun!! and is originally from Kumamoto. He is a pure-hearted high school student who constantly refuses Hibari's advances toward him, but as time goes on, he becomes increasingly concerned that he is being influenced by Hibari.

According to Suzume, Hibari becomes more feminine after K≈çsaku starts living at the ≈åzora household. Hibari shows an interest in K≈çsaku early on, and continues to make advances toward him throughout the series. Hibari gets bolder as the series progresses, including openly flirting with K≈çsaku at school, and kissing him. Hibari is extremely athletic and intelligent, in addition to being physically strong despite Hibari's relatively small body frame. Hibari is voiced by Satomi Majima. * is the boss of the ≈åzora Group, a yakuza organization. As the father of Tsugumi, Tsubame, Hibari and Suzume, he wants the ≈åzora Group to be family-oriented.

She falls in love easily and will do anything she can to bring her love to fruition. When something surprises her, she composes a haiku. Sayuri is voiced by Yuriko Yamamoto. Media Manga The Stop!! Hibari-kun! Complete Edition volumes feature newly drawn cover art by Hisashi Eguchi. The third volume depicts K≈çsaku (left) and Hibari (right). Stop!! Hibari-kun! is written and illustrated by Hisashi Eguchi. Following the conclusion of his manga in 1981, Eguchi wanted to go against the notion at the time that there was currently a golden age of romantic comedy manga in sh≈çnen manga magazines. In response, Eguchi thought of creating a romantic comedy manga where the main female character is a cross-dressing boy, and in doing so, poke fun at the genre by developing it as the antithesis of a romantic comedy. Eguchi drew up the storyboard for the first chapter in about 30 minutes in a cafe, and came up with the title Stop!! Hibari-kun! as a reference to Hisashi Sekiya's manga . In wanting to highlight the comedy of having a character like Hibari, Eguchi realized that the cuter he could draw Hibari, the more effective the jokes would be, so he tried to draw Hibari as cute as he could. Eguchi had often rushed when drawing his earlier manga , but starting with Stop!! Hibari-kun!, he raised the standards he held for his art and began taking more time to draw the chapters. In addition, Eguchi was very particular about the appearance of his manuscripts, so he never used white-out to correct any drawing errors because he disliked how it looked. As the serialization continued, Eguchi found it increasingly difficult to keep up a weekly pace for the chapters, leading him to take frequent hiatuses and later say that \\"drawing weekly isn't something humans can do.\\" Furthermore, the editor-in-chief of Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump at the time, Shigeo Nishimura, refused his request to release the chapters every other week. When it came time to draw what would end up being the last serialized chapter, Eguchi completed the chapter's storyboard, but ultimately submitted only about two-thirds of the chapter, leaving out the last five pages. After he submitted the chapter's manuscript, Eguchi fled to a hotel and secluded himself for a day, only coming out after Nishimura called him to say that he could not deal with him anymore on a weekly basis. As a result, Eguchi abandoned the serialization and the editorial department decided to discontinue the series. Stop!! Hibari-kun! was serialized in the manga magazine Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump from the October 19, 1981 issue to the November 28, 1983 issue. The individual chapters were collected and published in four tank≈çbon volumes by Shueisha from November 1982 to January 1984. Inspired by Katsuhiro Otomo, Eguchi fought against the established design format for the volumes that at the time was \\"set in stone\\" for series serialized in Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump. Futabasha later published it in three volumes in July 1991, and again in two volumes in February 1995. Shueisha republished it in four volumes from May to June 2001. Home-sha published it in two volumes in January 2004. In an interview in 2007, Eguchi expressed a desire to continue some of his older series, but stated that a continuation of Stop!! Hibari-kun! would be difficult. Starting in 2009, Eguchi began working with Shogakukan on releasing a Stop!! Hibari-kun! Complete Edition omnibus collection, which features various revisions to the originally published chapters in addition to newly drawn cover art. Not wanting to end the Complete Edition with an abrupt conclusion like he had done before, Eguchi found the storyboard for the final chapter and used it as a basis to newly draw the last five pages he had omitted 27 years earlier. Shogakukan published the Complete Edition in three volumes from July 2009 to February 2010; Shogakukan later republished the series in another three volumes from May to July 2012. In 2010, Eguchi did not rule out the possibility of someday drawing a continuation of the series, but he said it probably would not be a story under the title Stop!! Hibari-kun!. Anime A 35-episode anime television series adaptation, produced by Toei Animation and directed by Takashi Hisaoka. It aired from May 20, 1983 to January 27, 1984 on Fuji Television. The screenplay was written by: Shigeru Yanagawa, Tokio Tsuchiya, Hiroshi Toda, Tomomi Tsutsui, Takeshi Shudo and Yumi Asano. The character design used in the anime was provided by Yoshinori Kanemori, and the music was composed by K≈çji Nishimura. The series was later released by Universal J to two DVD compilation volumes from February to March 2003. A DVD box set was released by TC Entertainment in September 2014. The opening theme is sung by Yuki Yukino and the ending theme is sung by Ai Hoshino. Reception and legacy Psychologist Tamaki Sait≈ç described Stop!! Hibari-kun! as achieving a \\"dizzying reality\\" with Hibari \\"by contrasting a girlish exterior with a male interior\\", and went on to say that the series could be seen as a \\"continuation of the sartorial perversion lineage\\" of cross-dressing characters. Manga critic Haruyuki Nakano has called Stop!! Hibari-kun! a unique and outstanding gag manga for its juxtaposition of Hibari being a boy and the heir to a yakuza organization. Nakano largely attributes this successful combination to Eguchi's ability to draw girls that are not only cute, but also have good taste and sex appeal. The delicate touch in how Hibari is drawn has been described as so attractive that it makes the reader forget that it is a gag manga. In writing for the magazine Cyzo, manga critic Jyamao wrote that because of its overall light and pop literary style, none of the indecency or immorality cross-dressing may engender comes through, which he surmises is why the anime was able to air during prime time. Jyamao notes the more extreme nature of the jokes surrounding the yakuza characters in comparison to the jokes involving cross-dressing, and that some jokes such as those involving drugs would not be humorous today. Manga commentator Nobunaga Minami lauded Eguchi for being a pioneer in drawing characters with a high fashion sense in Stop!! Hibari-kun!, which he says effectively changed fashion in sh≈çnen manga from being seen as a \\"symbol\\" to now being treated as an \\"accessory\\". Eguchi's attention to detail is also praised, such as drawing K≈çsaku wearing Chuck Taylor All-Stars in one chapter. The series has been described as \\"effervescent,\\" and as helping pave the way for the J-pop phenomenon. When Tegami Bachi author Hiroyuki Asada read Stop!! Hibari-kun! in junior high school, he admired its novel sensibility, and Eguchi's art also influenced him. According to Eguchi, some people who read Stop!! Hibari-kun! were influenced to start cross-dressing. Notes * These chapters correspond to those in the Stop!! Hibari-kun! Complete Edition volumes. References External links *Stop!!

Hibari-kun!"},{"id":"17659397","text":"was a dragon or sea monster in Japanese mythology. Since it is written using the kanji È∞ê (from Chinese e È∞ê or È±∑ \\"crocodile; alligator\\") wani is translated as \\"crocodile\\", or sometimes \\"shark\\" (from wanizame È∞êÈÆ´ \\"shark\\"). Wani first occurs in two ancient Japanese \\"mytho-histories\\", the ca. 680 CE Kojiki and ca. 720 CE Nihongi. They write wani with the Man'y≈çgana phonetic transcription ÂíåÈÇá and the kanji È∞ê. The Kojiki uses wani ÂíåÈÇá several times as a proper name (e.g., the Confucianist scholar Wani, Chamberlain 1919:2,313) and as a sea- monster in two contexts. First, in the \\"White Hare of Inaba\\" fable, the gods try and fail to help a shiro ÁôΩ (lit. \\"white\\") \\"naked; hairless\\" hare that they found crying on a beach. > But the Deity Great-Name-Possessor, who came last of all, saw the hare, and > said: \\"Why liest thou weeping?\\" The hare replied, saying: \\"I was in the > Island of Oki, and wished to cross over to this land, but had no means of > crossing over. For this reason I deceived the crocodiles of the sea, saying: > 'Let you and me compete, and compute the numbers of our [respective] tribes. > So do you go and fetch every member of your tribe, and make them all lie in > a row across from this island to Cape Keta. Then I will tread on them, and > count them as I run across. Hereby shall we know whether it or my tribe is > the larger.' Upon my speaking thus, they were deceived and lay down in a > row, and I trod on them and counted them as I came across, and was just > about to get on land, when I said: 'You have been deceived by me.' As soon > as I had finished speaking, the crocodile who lay the last of all seized me > and stripped off all my clothing. As I was weeping and lamenting for this > reason, the eighty Deities who went by before [thee] commanded and exhorted > me, saying: 'Bathe in the salt water, and lie down exposed to the wind.' So, > on my doing as they had instructed me, my whole body was hurt.\\" Thereupon > the Deity Great-Name-Possessor instructed the hare, saying: \\"Go quickly now > to the river-mouth, wash thy body with the fresh water, then take the pollen > of the sedges [growing] at the river-mouth, spread it about, and roll about > upon it, whereupon thy body will certainly be restored to its original > state.\\" So [the hare] did as it was instructed, and its body became as it > had been originally. This was the White Hare of Inaba. It is now called the > Hare Deity. (tr. Chamberlain 1919:1,81-2) Second, wani is a fundamental theme in the myth of the demigod brothers Hoori and Hoderi. The sea god Watatsumi or Ry≈´jin \\"summoned together all the crocodiles\\" (tr. Chamberlain 1919:150) and chose one to escort his pregnant daughter Toyotama-hime and her husband Hoori from the Ry≈´g≈´-j≈ç palace back to land. Soon after their arrival, the beautiful Toyatama-hime made a bizarre request concerning her shapeshifting into a wani. > Then, when she was about to be delivered, she spoke to her husband [saying]: > \\"Whenever a foreigner is about to be delivered, she takes the shape of her > native land to be delivered. So I now will take my native shape to be > delivered. Pray look not upon me!\\" Hereupon [His Augustness Fire-Subside], > thinking these words strange, stealthily peeped at the very moment of > delivery, when she turned into a crocodile eight fathoms [long], and crawled > and writhed about; and he forthwith, terrified at the sight, fled away. Then > Her Augustness Luxuriant-Jewel-Princess knew that he had peeped; and she > felt ashamed, and, straightway leaving the august child which she had borne, > she said: 'I had wished always to come and go across the sea-path. But thy > having peeped at my [real] shape [makes me] very shame-faced,\\" ‚Äì and she > forthwith closed the sea-boundary, and went down again. (tr. Chamberlain > 1919:155) Basil Hall Chamberlain compared Ernest Mason Satow's (1881:205) translation of wani as \\"sea shark\\". \\"The hare replied: 'I was in the Island of the Offing and wished to cross over to this land, but having no means of doing so, cheated the sea sharks (wani)'.\\" Chamberlain justified translating \\"crocodile\\" in a footnote. > There is perhaps some want of clearness in the old historical books in the > details concerning the creature in question, and its fin is mentioned in the > \\"Chronicles.\\" But the accounts point rather to an amphibious creature, > conceived of as being somewhat similar to the serpent, than to a fish, and > the Chinese descriptions quoted by the Japanese commentators unmistakably > refer to the crocodile. The translator therefore sees no sufficient reason > for abandoning the usually accepted interpretation of wani (È∞ê) as > \\"crocodile.\\" It should be noticed that the wani is never introduced into any > but patently fabulous stories, and that the example of other nations, and > indeed of Japan itself, shows that myth-makers have no objection to > embellish their tales by the mention of wonders supposed to exist in foreign > lands. (1916:xliv) The Nihongi likewise uses wani several times as a proper name (e.g., a mountain pass called \\"Wani acclivity\\", tr. Aston 1896:1,156), and twice in the word kuma-wani ÁÜäÈ∞ê \\"bear (i.e., giant or strong) shark/crocodile\\". First, the mythical sea god Kotoshiro-nushi-no-kami (see Ebisu) is described as a ya-hiro no kuma-wani ÂÖ´Â∞ãÁÜäÈ∞ê \\"8-fathom bear-wani\\". De Visser (1913:140) says \\"The epithet \\"bear\\" means \\"strong as a bear\\"\\". > Another version is that Koto-shiro-nushi no Kami, having become transformed > into an eight-fathom bear-sea-monster, had intercourse with Mizo-kuhi hime > of the island of Mishima (some call her Tama-kushi-hime), and had by her a > child named Hime-tatara I-suzu-hime no Mikoto, who became the Empress of > Emperor Kami-Yamato Ihare-biko Hohodemi. (tr. Aston 1896:1,61-2) Second, the Nihongi chapters on legendary Emperor Ch≈´ai and his Empress Jing≈´ combine two myths of Japanese tide jewels and Indian nyoi-ju Â¶ÇÊÑèÁè† \\"cintamani; wish-fulfilling jewels\\". In 193 CE, the Empress supposedly \\"found in the sea a Nyoi pearl\\" (tr. Aston 1896:219), and in 199 CE, the imperial ships encountered a kuma-wani with a giant tamagushi. > The Emperor proceeded to Tsukushi. At this time Kuma-wani, the ancestor of > the Agata-nushi of Oka, hearing of the Emperor's arrival, pulled up > beforehand a 500-branched Sakaki tree, which he set up on the bows of a > nine-fathom ship. On the upper branches he hung a white-copper mirror, on > the middle branches he hung a ten-span sword, and on the lower branches he > hung Yasaka jewels. With these he went out to meet him at the Bay of Saha in > Suwo, and presented to him a fish-salt-place. In doing so, he addressed the > Emperor, saying: \\"Let the Great Ferry from Anato to Mukatsuno be its Eastern > Gate and the Great Ferry of Nagoya be its Western Gate. Let the Islands of > Motori and Abe and none else be the august baskets: let the Island of Shiba > be divided and made the august pans: let the Sea of Sakami be the salt- > place.\\" He then acted as the Emperor's pilot. Going round Cape Yamaga, he > entered the Bay of Oka. But in entering the harbour, the ship was unable to > go forward. So he inquired of Kuma-wani, saying: \\"We have heard that thou, > Kuma-wani, hast come to us with an honest heart. Why does the ship not > proceed?\\" Kuma-wani addressed the Emperor, saying: \\"It is not the fault of > thy servant that the august ship is unable to advance. At the entrance to > this bay there are two Deities, one male and the other female. The male > Deity is called Oho-kura-nushi, the female Deity is called Tsubura-hime. It > must be owing to the wish of these Deities.\\" The Emperor accordingly prayed > to them, and caused them to be sacrificed to, appointing his steersman Iga- > hiko, a man of Uda in the province of Yamato, as priest. So the ship was > enabled to proceed. The Empress entered in a different ship by the Sea of > Kuki. As the tide was out, she was unable to go on. Then Kuma-wani went back > and met the Empress by way of Kuki. Thereupon he saw that the august ship > made no progress, and he was afraid. He hastily made a fish-pond and a bird- > pond, into which he collected all the fishes and birds. When the Empress saw > these fishes and birds sporting, her anger was gradually appeased, and with > the flowing tide she straightway anchored in the harbour of Oka. (tr. Aston > 1896:219‚Äì220) William George Aston justified not translating wani as \\"crocodile\\". He refers to the Ry≈´jin ÈæçÁ•û \\"dragon god\\", his daughter Toyotama-hime Ë±äÁéâÂß´ \\"luminous jewel princess\\" (who married the Japanese imperial ancestor Hoori or Hohodemi), Dragon King myths, and the scholar Wani who served Emperor ≈åjin. > Sea-monster is in Japanese wani. It is written with a Chinese character > which means, properly, crocodile, but that meaning is inadmissible in these > old legends, as the Japanese who originated them can have known nothing of > this animal. The wani, too, inhabits the sea and not rivers, and is plainly > a mythical creature. Satow and Anderson have noted that the wani is usually > represented in art as a dragon, and Toyo-tama-hime ‚Ä¶ who in one version of > the legend changes into a wani, as her true form at the moment of child- > birth, according to another changes into a dragon. Now Toyo-tama-hime was > the daughter of the God of the Sea. This suggests that the latter is one of > the Dragon-Kings familiar to Chinese ‚Ä¶ and Corean fable who inhabit splendid > palaces at the bottom of the sea. ‚Ä¶ It is possible that wani is for the > Corean wang-i, i.e. \\"the King,\\" i being the Corean definite particle, as in > zeni, fumi, yagi, and other Chinese words which reached Japan via Corea? We > have the same change of ng into n in the name of the Corean who taught > Chinese to the Japanese Prince Imperial in Ojin Tenno's reign. It is Wang-in > in Corean, but was pronounced Wani by the Japanese. Wani occurs several > times as a proper name in the \\"Nihongi\\". Bear (in Japanese kuma) is no doubt > an epithet indicating size, as in kuma-bachi, bear-bee or bear-wasp, i.e. a > hornet; kuma-gera, a large kind of wood-pecker, etc. (1896:1,61-2) Aston later wrote that. > There can be little doubt that the wani is really the Chinese dragon. It is > frequently so represented in Japanese pictures. I have before me a print > which shows Toyotama-hiko and his daughter with dragon's heads appearing > over their human ones. This shows that he was conceived of not only as a > Lord of Dragons, but as a dragon himself. His daughter, who in one version > of the story changes at the moment of child-bearing into a wani as her true > form, in another is converted into a dragon. In Japanese myth the serpent or > dragon is almost always associated with water in some of its forms. > (1905:149‚Äì150) Marinus Willern de Visser discussed the wani in detail (1913:139‚Äì142). He compared versions of the myth about Hoori or Hohodemi seeing his sea-princess wife Toyotama-hime turning into a wani or a \\"dragon\\" during childbirth, and strongly disagrees with Aston's hypotheses about Japanese wani deriving from Korean wang-i \\"the king\\" and the wani legend having features of Chinese and Indian Dragon Kings. > Although the Indian notions about the Naga-kings related above [1913:1‚Äì34] > are easily to be recognized in the Japanese legend, yet I think we must not > go as far as to consider the whole story western, nor have we the right to > suspect the old word wani on account of the fact that a part of the legend > is of foreign origin. Why should the ancient Japanese or Koreans have called > these sea-monsters \\"kings\\", omitting the word \\"dragon\\", which is the most > important part of the combined term \\"dragon-king\\"? And if the full term were > used in Korea, certainly the Japanese would not have taken up only its last > part. In my opinion the wani is an old Japanese dragon- or serpent-shaped > sea-god, and the legend is an ancient Japanese tale, dressed in an Indian > garb by later generations. The oldest version probably related how Hohodemi > went to the sea-god, married his daughter and obtained from him the two > jewels of ebb and flood [i.e., tide jewels], or some other means to punish > his brother by nearly drowning him; afterwards, when having returned to the > earth, he built the parturition-house, and breaking his promise of not > looking at his wife when she was giving birth, saw that she had changed into > a wani, i.e. an enormous sea-monster. As to the pearls, although mysterious > jewels are very common in the Indian tales about the Naga-kings, it is > possible that also Japanese sea-gods were believed to possess them, as the > sea conceals so many treasures in her depths; but it may also be an Indian > conception. When later generations got acquainted with the Chinese and > Indian dragons, they identified their wani with the latter, and embellished > their old legends with features, borrowed from the Indian Naga tales. > (1913:140) De Visser additionally compared the Japanese Hoori/Hohodemi legend with Indonesian myths from the Kei Islands and Minahassa Peninsula. > After having written this I got acquainted with the interesting fact, > pointed out by F. W. K. M√úLLER [1893:533], that a similar myth is to be > found as well on the Kei islands as in the Minahassa. The resemblance of > several features of this myth with the Japanese one is so striking, that we > may be sure that the latter is of Indonesian origin. Probably the foreign > invaders, who in prehistoric times conquered Japan, came from Indonesia and > brought this myth with them. In the Kei version the man who had lost the > hook, lent to him by his brother, enters the clouds in a boat and at last > finds the hook in the throat of a fish. In the Minahassa legend, however, he > dives into the sea and arrives at a village at the bottom of the water. > There he discovers the hook in the throat of a girl, and is brought home on > the back of a big fish. And like Hohodemi punished his brother by nearly > drowning him by means of the jewel of flood-tide, so the hero of the > Minahassa legend by his prayers caused the rain to come down in torrents > upon his evil friend. In Japan Buddhist influence evidently has changed the > village in the sea into the palace of a Dragon king, but in the older > version the sea-god and his daughter have kept their original shapes of > wani, probably a kind of crocodiles, as the Chinese character indicates. An > old painting of Sensai Eitaku, reproduced by M√úLLER, shows Hohodemi > returning home on the back of a crocodile. It is quite possible that the > form of this Indonesian myth introduced into Japan spoke about crocodiles, > and that the vague conception of these animals was retained under the old > name of wani, which may be an Indonesian word. (1913:141) De Visser further disputed Aston's contention that \\"the wani is really the Chinese dragon\\" and concluded that the print reproduced by Aston (1905:149) is actually an Indian motif > ‚Ä¶ transferred to China and from there to Korea and Japan. As the sea-god in > his magnificent palace was an Indian conception, Japanese art represented > him, of course, in an Indian way. This is, however, no proof that the wani > originally was identical with the Naga, or with the Chinese-Indian dragon- > kings. (1913:142) Smith (1919:103) disagreed with de Visser, \\"The wani or crocodile thus introduced from India, via Indonesia, is really the Chinese and Japanese dragon, as Aston has claimed.\\" Visser's proposal for an Indonesian wani origin is linguistically corroborated by Benedict's (1990:193) hypothetical Proto- Austro-tai *mba≈ãiwak \\"shark; crocodile\\" root that split into Japanese wani È∞ê and uo È≠ö \\"fish\\".

Membership is open to student associations from any post-secondary institution in Alberta, and ASEC currently includes members from 15 universities, colleges, and polytechnic institutions across the province. The ASEC membership represents 100,000 students, or approximately 1/3 of all post-secondary students in Alberta, Canada. ASEC is a member-driven organization that is governed by its Board of Directors and Delegate Committee, both selected from its membership. Each member association is represented at the Delegate Committee by a student leader as a voting delegate, or is assigned a proxy representative. ASEC is governed by the \\"one-school one-vote\\" principle to ensure that all member organizations are treated equally, regardless of student body size. The Delegate Committee is responsible for the approval of advocacy priorities, the annual selection of the auditor, and the selection of the Board of Directors. The ASEC Board of Directors is composed of six student leaders, two staff members from member organizations (non-voting), and the executive director (non-voting). The Board is responsible for the strategic and financial direction of the organization, as well as oversight of the executive director. The executive director is responsible for the daily operations of ASEC, as well as tasks relating to member relations, staff oversight, and financial management. Other staff members include the director of government relations and advocacy. History ASEC begun as ACTISEC (Alberta College and Technical Institute Students' Executive Council), and was created after the disbanding of the Federation of Alberta Students (FAS) (a provincial organization that represented all of the public post-secondary institutions in Alberta) in 1981, when a number of colleges and technical institutes withdrew their membership citing domination of FAS by the universities. In 1982 a group of student delegates from colleges and technical institutes (Grant MacEwan College, Lakeland College, Lethbridge College, The Northern Alberta Institute of Technology, Medicine Hat College, Mount Royal College and The Southern Alberta Institute of Technology) met to form ACTISEC, an organization that would recognize the differences of all non-university post-secondary students. The inaugural meeting of ACTISEC was held at the Northern Alberta Institute of Technology on March 11, 1982. David Whalen from NAITSA was appointed as the initiating Chairperson of the council, and sent a letter to James Horseman, the Minister of Advanced Education at the time, advising him of the formation of the new organization. In the onset, the group focused mainly on sharing information and resources between its member institutions, as well as professional development of student leaders. Over time, however, it became apparent that there was also a need for a strong lobby organization that would concentrate mainly on external issues affecting post-secondary education, and on maintaining constant communication with government and other post-secondary institutions and organizations. In May 2009, after it was made clear by the Government of Alberta that Grant MacEwan College and Mount Royal College would become known as Universities, ACTISEC initiated a name change to reflect its changing membership. The name Alberta Students' Executive Council was selected; ASEC's first Leadership Conference was held in May 2009 in Edmonton, Alberta. In 2014 the students' associations of Mount Royal University, MacEwan University, and Athabasca University announced they were leaving ASEC and would be completing that process by March 2015.

The correct term would be Korean cornel dogwood or Chinese cornel dogwood since the flower originated from Korea and China. These plants are not closely related to the true cherries of the genus Prunus. Description It is a large, strongly-growing deciduous shrub with rough flaky bark. Umbels of acid yellow flowers appear in early spring before the oval leaves. The red berries, which are edible, appear later in the summer, and the leaves turn shades of red before falling in the autumn. Etymology In Korean it is known as sansuyu (), in Chinese as () and in Japanese as . The Latin specific epithet officinalis refers to plants which have some medicinal or culinary use - in this case the edible berries. Cultivation The plant is valued in cultivation for providing year-round interest in the garden. It is, however, quite a substantial shrub, typically growing to tall and broad. The cultivar 'Kintoki', with larger and more abundant flowers, has won the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. Traditional medicine It occurs in China, Japan and Korea where it is used as a food plant and as a medicinal plant.

They currently play in London 2 North East - a league at the seventh tier of the English rugby union system. A Brief history Like Nomads, rugby players in Romford have been on the move since their first match in 1929. It was not until September, 1983 that the club were able to 'touch down' at a base that they could properly call home, following the purchase of a site in Crow Lane. In 1929, the founder members, Leslie Diebel and Jimmy Paxton, placed an advert in the local newspaper inviting anyone interested in playing rugby to attend a meeting in the Ship Inn in Gidea Park. Following this meeting, The Ship became the first headquarters of the Gidea Park Rugby Club. The first match was played against Chingford, but the result has long since been forgotten in the mist of time. In those early days, the club used a sports ground at Gallows Corner in Gidea Park for their home matches. With no rugby during the Second World War, the club was reformed in 1946, moving in 1949 to play home matches at Raphael's Park. It was then that the now familiar colours of black, purple and white were adopted from the crest of Lord Raphael. In 1953, the club moved again - this time to Cottons Park. The players built their own clubhouse and as the club's popularity increased, so did the clubhouse! As befitting its new location, Romford was added to the club's name - \\"Gidea Park and Romford RFC\\". Two years later, this appellation was changed to the present \\"Romford and Gidea Park RFC\\". With Ralph Klar MC as the driving force, another small extension was added. In 1961, Ralph was elected as the club's first life member. During the 1960s and 70s, the club flourished and was the welcome recipient of a healthy influx of Welsh schoolteachers, including Romford legends like Glyn Johns (an inspiring and uncompromising prop forward) and Lynn Herbert (a product of the Welsh fly-half factory). Indeed, at one time, the first XV boasted a total of 14 Welsh regulars, along with their captain Alec Daly - A Scot! In the 1970s, the club regularly fielded 5 senior sides and, with the increasing popularity of junior and mini rugby, the clubhouse and playing facilities were outgrown. So the search was on to find yet another home. In 1981, with Pat Ridley (a much revered club character and Club President 1975-85) to the fore, the club negotiated the purchase of their present home within easy access of Romford centre. After two years hard work and fundraising, of land were converted into four pitches and a purpose built clubhouse with changing accommodation was constructed. The club continued to thrive. Scrum half Dave Duffus returned from Hong Kong, where he had played for the colony in their Hong Kong Sevens, to skipper the club for a record 5 seasons. Other notable captains included Maurice Washbourne, who later became a successful Club Chairman during the 1990s, and the Scottish trialist Mike Lovatt. Another important development was the installation of floodlights on the main pitch, which then enabled the club to start hosting county finals. Recent seasons have seen the senior sides to strive to match the developments and success of a youth and mini section. Ian \\"Paddy\\" Dunston (England Colts, 1988) gained the distinction of being the club's first international with Terry Ellis playing for England Schools U16s in 1997. In the 2004 season Jon Mason represented England 18 Group v France Ireland and Wales, while Frank Neale was selected for England Colleges. Adam Powell was also fast-tracked into the U19 England squad and played in their Grand Slam Six Nations programme and also played in the U19 World Cup in South Africa where England finished fourth. Many successful tours have been undertaken, including trips to France, Italy and South Africa. 2002 bought another milestone to the club when the long serving Dai Davies was elected County president. During his two-year presidency, Essex became independent of Eastern Counties and gained their own Constituent Body Status of the RFU. Dai has now taken over the Presidency from the long serving Ron Johnson for the start of the 2005/06 season. The 2003/04 season saw the club establish a Ladies XV - The Romford Ravens. The team are developing well and are set to become a prominent part of the club during the forthcoming seasons, as the club looks forward to the next 75 years!

He is most notable for his development of the betatron, a novel type of particle accelerator used to accelerate electrons. A graduate of the University of Wisconsin, Kerst developed the first betatron at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, where it became operational on July 15, 1940. During World War II, Kerst took a leave of absence in 1940 and 1941 to work on it with the engineering staff at General Electric, and he designed a portable betatron for inspecting dud bombs. In 1943 he joined the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos Laboratory, where he was responsible for designing and building the Water Boiler, a nuclear reactor intended to serve as a laboratory instrument. From 1953 to 1957 Kerst was technical director of the Midwestern Universities Research Association, where he worked on advanced particle accelerator concepts, most notably the FFAG accelerator. He was then employed at General Atomics's John Jay Hopkins Laboratory from 1957 to 1962, where he worked on the problem of plasma physics. With Tihiro Ohkawa he invented toroidal devices for containing the plasma with magnetic fields. Their devices were the first to contain plasma without the instabilities that had plagued previous designs, and the first to contain plasma for lifetimes exceeding the Bohm diffusion limit. Early life Donald William Kerst was born in Galena, Illinois November 1, 1911, the son of Herman Samuel Kerst and Lillian E Wetz. He entered the University of Wisconsin, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in 1934, and then his Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in 1937, writing his thesis on \\"The Development of Electrostatic Generators in Air Pressure and Applications to Excitation Functions of Nuclear Reactions\\". This involved building and testing a 2.3 MeV generator for experiments with the scattering of protons. Betatron After graduation, Kerst worked at General Electric Company for a year, working on the development of x-ray tubes and machines. He found this frustrating, as x-ray research required high energies that could not be produced at the time. In 1938 he accepted an offer of an instructorship at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, where the head of the physics department, F. Wheeler Loomis encouraged Kerst in his efforts to create a better particle accelerator. The result of these efforts was the betatron. When it became operational on July 15, 1940, Kerst became the first person to accelerate electrons using electromagnetic induction, reaching energies of 2.3 MeV. It took longer to name the device. Colleagues suggested names such as the German \\"Ausserordentlichhochgeschwindigkeitelektronenentwickelndenschwerarbeitsbeigollitron\\". In December 1941 Kerst decided on \\"betatron\\", using the Greek letter \\"beta\\", which was the symbol for electrons, and \\"tron\\" meaning \\"instrument for\\". He went on to build more betatrons of increasing energy, a 20 MeV machine in 1941, an 80 MeV in 1948, and a 340 MeV machine, which was completed in 1950. The betatron would influence all subsequent accelerators. Its success was due to a thorough understanding of the physics involved, and painstaking design of the magnets, vacuum pumps and power supply. In 1941, he teamed up with Robert Serber to provide the first theoretical analysis of the oscillations that occur in a betatron. The original 1940 machine was donated to the Smithsonian Institution in 1960. World War II The Water Boiler, an aqueous homogeneous reactor at the Los Alamos Laboratory, was the first reactor to use enriched uranium as a fuel During World War II, Kerst took a leave of absence from the University of Illinois to work on the development of the betatron with the engineering staff at General Electric in 1940 and 1941. They designed 20 MeV and 100 MeV versions of the betatron, and he supervised the construction of the former, which he brought back to the University of Illinois with him. He also designed a portable 4 MeV betatron for inspecting dud bombs. Kerst's engineering and physics background placed him near the top of the list of scientists that Robert Oppenheimer recruited for the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos Laboratory, which was set up to design the atomic bomb. In August 1943, Kerst was placed in charge of the Laboratory's P-7 Group, which was responsible for designing and building the Water Boiler, a nuclear reactor intended to serve as a laboratory instrument to test critical mass calculations and the effect of various tamper materials. Primarily drawn from Purdue University, his group included Charles P. Baker, Gerhart Friedlander, Lindsay Helmholtz, Marshall Holloway, and Raemer Schreiber. Robert F. Christy provided help with the theoretical calculations. Kerst designed an aqueous homogeneous reactor in which enriched uranium in the form of soluble uranium sulfate, was dissolved in water, and surrounded by a beryllium oxide neutron reflector. It was the first reactor to employ enriched uranium as a fuel, and required most of the world's meager supply at the time. A sufficient quantity of enriched uranium arrived at Los Alamos by April 1944, and the Water Boiler commenced operation in May. By the end of June it had achieved all of its design goals. The Los Alamos Laboratory was reorganized in August 1944 to concentrate on creating an implosion-type nuclear weapon. Studying implosion on a large scale, or even a full scale, required special diagnostic methods. As early as November 1943, Kerst suggested using a betatron employing 20 MeV gamma rays instead of x-rays to study implosion. In the August 1944 reorganization, he became joint head, with Seth Neddermeyer, of the G-5 Group, part of Robert Bacher's G (Gadget) Division specifically charged with betatron testing. Oppenheimer had the 20 MeV betatron at the University of Illinois shipped to Los Alamos, where it arrived in December. On January 15, 1945, the G-5 Group took their first betatron pictures of an implosion. Later life Kerst returned to the University of Illinois after the war. From 1953 to 1957 he was technical director of the Midwestern Universities Research Association, where he worked on advanced particle accelerator concepts, most notably the FFAG accelerator. He developed the spiral-sector focusing principle, which lies at the heart of many spiral ridge cyclotrons that are now in operation around the world. His team devised and analysed beam stacking, a process of radio frequency acceleration in fixed field machines that led to the development of the colliding beam accelerators. From 1957 to 1962 Kerst was employed at the General Atomics division of General Dynamics's John Jay Hopkins Laboratory for Pure and Applied Science in La Jolla, California, where he worked on plasma physics, which it was hoped was the doorway to the control of thermonuclear energy. With Tihiro Ohkawa he invented toroidal devices for containing the plasma with magnetic fields. The two completed this work at the University of Wisconsin, where Kerst was a professor from 1962 until his retirement in 1980. Their devices were the first to contain plasma without the instabilities that had plagued previous designs, and the first to contain plasma for lifetimes exceeding the Bohm diffusion limit. From 1972 to 1973 he was also chairman of the Plasma Physics Division of the American Physical Society. Kerst was married to Dorothy Birkett Kerst. They had two children, a daughter, Marilyn, and a son, Stephen. After he retired, Kerst and Dorothy moved to Fort Myers, Florida. He died on August 19, 1993 at the University Hospital and Clinics in Madison, Wisconsin, from a brain tumor. He was survived by his wife and children. His papers are in the University of Illinois Archives.

It offered a range of GCSE and Certificate of Achievement qualifications. It became part of OCR in 1998. History The board was one of a number of new 'examining groups' formed to develop syllabuses for the GCSE qualification, which was due to replace the GCE O Level and CSE qualifications in 1988. MEG was formed by the University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate, the Oxford and Cambridge Schools Examination Board and Southern Universities' Joint Board for School Examinations GCE boards and the East Midlands Regional Examinations Board and The West Midlands Examinations Board CSE boards in 1985. Though this was not a merger and the boards remained independent of each other, the East Midlands and West Midlands boards, who stopped offering CSEs after they were phased out in 1987, now only offered exams as part of MEG, although they continued their other services such as in-service training, OFSTED inspections, and prison service education. The operation and processing of the GCSE was shared out between the constituent boards with the Oxford, Cambridge, Bristol, Nottingham and Birmingham centres each taking responsibility for a number of the subjects offered. The University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate, Oxford and Cambridge Schools Examination Board and Southern Universities' Joint Board each continued to offer A Levels independently. Despite its regional name, schools were free to pick which exam board to use for their qualifications and MEG eventually set 30% of all GCSE qualifications taken each year.UCLES  Corporate Information The board also wrote syllabuses for the Certificate of Achievement (later becoming the Entry Level Certificate), aimed at students working below GCSE level. In 1993, MEG became part of the University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate (UCLES), though it retained its separate identity. Around this time, UCLES also took over the East Midland Regional Examination Board. UCLES's A Level division, the Oxford and Cambridge Examinations and Assessment Council (OCEAC), took over both the Southern Universities' Joint Board and later, in 1995, the Oxford and Cambridge Board. The Midland Examining Group (MEG) headquarters offices were then in Cambridge at the UCLES offices in Hills Road, although some MEG subject officers and part of the exam processing were still based in Birmingham in the TWMEB offices at Mill Wharf.http://birmingham.cylex-uk.co.uk/company/midland- examining-group-west-midland- office-18647861.htmlhttp://birmingham.enquira.co.uk/education- training/education-agencies-authorities/midland-examining-group-west-midland- office-l15647.html Following the government decision to establish \\"unitary\\" exam boards, UCLES announced in 1997 that it was, with the Royal Society of Arts Examinations Board, launching the Oxford, Cambridge and RSA Examinations (OCR) exam board, which would take over running all UCLES (including MEG and OCEAC) and RSA qualifications in the United Kingdom from October 1, 1998, though it continued to use the old syllabuses until they expired. The West Midlands Examinations Board became part of OCR. The MEG name appeared on some, but not all, of the Summer 1999 exam papers, but the certificates for that year, and all subsequent exam papers, featured the OCR name only.

The site, about half of which is wetlands, was a popular tourist spot known as Dawson Beach until the 1940s, after which it was used for military research by the U.S. Army's Harry Diamond Laboratories from the 1960s to the 1990s. When the land was purchased from the military, it was temporarily called the Marumsco National Wildlife Refuge. The refuge was formally established and renamed in 1998, and is now managed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service as part of the Potomac River National Wildlife Refuge Complex.  Geography and biodiversity  Wildflowers in the refuge Wildflowers in the refuge When the Army obtained the site in 1950 for use as a radio transmitting station, fields of antennas replaced cows and crops. In the 1970s, the base's mission shifted to top secret research. Electromagnetic pulse testing and sight lines for security kept the vegetation low, primarily in grasslands. When the base closed in the 1990s, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service was able to continue to preserve these grasslands as wildlife habitat. The refuge has a mix of wetlands, forest, and native grasslands that provides a diversity of habitats for wide variety of species. Wetland habitats cover about 50% of the refuge and include wet meadows, bottomland hardwoods, open freshwater marsh, and tidally influenced marshes and streams. Upland meadows and mature oak-hickory-beech forest are interspersed among the wetlands. The unusual number and interspersion of habitats provides visitors an opportunity to view a wide variety of wildlife species and habitats in a relatively small area. Noted for its grassland nesting birds, neo-tropical migrants and raptors, the refuge also hosts wildlife common to Virginia. Over 220 species of birds, over 600 species of plants, and 65 species of butterflies have been documented on the refuge. Many of the bird species are uncommon or rare in the region.

The mere occupied the land southeast of Yaxley Fen, south of Farcet Fen and north of Holme Fen. The town of Whittlesey lay to the northeast.http://www.streetmap.co.uk/newmap.srf?x=522500&y;=290500&z;=4&sv;=522500,290500&st;=4&ar;=N&mapp;=newmap.srf&searchp;=newsearch.srf&ax;=519500&ay;=290500 Whittlesea Mere was the last of the 'great meres' to be drained. The old course of the River Nene took it into the mere on one side and out on the other. The area covered by water was at least 1,870 acres (756 hectares) in summer, extending to 3,000 acres (1,214 ha) in winter. The mere was a source of fish, wildfowl, reed and sedge for local inhabitants, and also provided a setting for 'water picnics' for the region's nobility. According to the traveller Celia Fiennes, who saw it in 1697, the mere was \\"3 mile broad and six mile long. In the midst is a little island where a great store of Wildfowle breed.... The ground is all wett and marshy but there are severall little Channells runs into it which by boats people go up to this place; when you enter the mouth of the Mer it looks formidable and its often very dangerous by reason of sudden winds that will rise like Hurricanes....\\"The Journeys of Celia Fiennes. Edited and introduced by Christopher Morris (London: The Cresset Press, 1949), p. 67. History Before drainage, the fens contained many shallow lakes, of which Whittlesey Mere was the largest. The River Nene originally flowed through this mere, then south to Ugg Mere, before turning east towards the Ouse. By 1851, silting and peat expansion had reduced Whittlesey Mere to about 400 ha and only a metre deep. Drainage The \\"Black Ham Engine\\" used in the 1850s to drain Whittlesey Mere. Unique in that it was turf fired V&A; Museum; they were found when the mere was drained The construction of a new main drain of the Middle Level Navigations to Wiggenhall St Germans completed in 1848, enabled the mere to be drained. A pumping station with an Appold centrifugal pump was used to achieve this, rather than the more traditional scoop wheel. The pump had been shown for the first time at the Great Exhibition in 1851 and its inventor was commissioned to design a pump for the draining of the mere. It was in diameter, and powered by a steam engine, could raise 101 tons of water per minute by . The project was funded by a group of gentlemen and local landowners: William Wells of Holmewood; Heathcote of Conington Castle; Edward Fellowes of Ramsey Abbey; Thornhill of Diddington; Lord Sandwich; and Wentworth Fitzwilliam of Milton. The drainage turned both the mere and Holme Fen into usable farmland, but subsidence followed. A thurible and other silver items were found in the bed of the mere and from the ram's head on one of these pieces were believed to have come from Ramsey Abbey. The thurible (or censer), incense boat and a sword are now in the Victoria & Albert Museum. Also found in the bed were blocks of quarried stone, which are supposed to have fallen from a barge on their way to the Abbey. A flood occurred in 1852 and the mere filled with water, but it was drained again. In 1862, the Marshland Sluice gave way under pressure from the tide and water flooded in. It was drained once more and farming resumed.Wentworth Day, J. (1954). A History of the Fens. George G. Harrap & Co. Ltd, London. Modern day The name 'Whittlesea Mere' remains on maps to this day, although the only water is to be found in farmers' irrigation reservoirs and dykes draining the fertile farmland. Stage 3 of the Great Fen Project may eventually see the mere return to wetland.Great Fen Project Local legends A local legend, first recounted in The Leisure Hour (1887) by a writer who claimed to have heard it from the principal actor, tells of a cottager's son from Holme who while employed bird scaring on Holme Fen one Sunday in February, 1851, wandered from his post and sank up to his armpits in the reed beds of Whittlesey Mere. Obscured from view, he remained stuck for 19 hours, which he ascertained from the sound of the bells of All Saints Church, Conington, until a fellow villager found him by chance, extricated him and returned him to his parents.

Vehicles under this name were known technically within Peugeot as the Type 69 and the Type BP1. Type 69 The original B√©b√© was presented at the Paris Motor Show in 1904 and stole the show as a modern and robust creation that was cheap, small, and practical. Its weight was and length was , and these tiny dimensions meant that its small engine could propel it to . Though selling price was deliberately kept as low as possible, technologies like rack and pinion steering and a driveshaft instead of a chain were included in the vehicle. Production began in Audincourt in 1905, and the car proved to be popular. B√©b√© sold 400 units in the first year, or 80% of Peugeot's production. It was also exported, particularly to Britain. The Type 69 was sold only for the year 1905. A Type 69 was one of the first two motor vehicles in Tibet, imported by William Frederick Travers O'Connor in 1907 and later given as a gift to the Thubten Choekyi Nyima, the 9th Panchen Lama. Type BP1 The Type BP1 B√©b√© was a design by Ettore Bugatti, initially for the German car firm Wanderer , then also built under license by Peugeot for the French market. Peugeot displayed it under their marque at the Paris Motor Show in 1912. Production began in 1913 following discontinuation of the Type 69. Wanderer built their car with Bugatti's own 4-speed transmission, but in order to keep production costs down for the French version, Peugeot fitted a 2-speed gearbox initially, which was then replaced by their own 3-speed. The engine was also Peugeot's own, a tiny straight-4 that produced at 2000 rpm, which gave the small car a top speed of . Weight was again below , though the track was wide enough for two to sit abreast. B√©b√© scored some racing success among small car classes, notably at Mont Ventoux in 1913, where it won in its class. This model ran until 1916. Advertising promoted its qualities as an economy product, in one case highlighting the comparison with more conventional transport in the case of a rural doctor, needing to cover approximately 40 kilometers (25 miles) per day, for whom a B√©b√© would replace a team of two horses, while costing no more than one of them. With a total of 3,095 produced, and despite the dire economic conditions created by the war, the Bugatti designed B√©b√© was the first production Peugeot to breach the 3,000 units threshold.Mus√©e de l'Aventure Peugeot.

It was isolated from beef soup by Yamasaki and Maekawa in 1978. Ongoing research since its discovery by Yamasaki and Maekawa has provided general support for the presence of its flavor- imparting properties. However, due to its high production cost, the peptide's potential for widespread application in the food industry has yet to be realized, prompting current research efforts to focus on finding a method of mass-production for the peptide. Identification  Sequence  Lys-Gly- Asp-Glu-Glu-Ser-Leu-Ala The primary structure was first determined by Yamasaki and Maekawa, who carried out the experiment using the Edman degradation method for N-terminus sequencing and carboxypeptidase A (Cpase A) and triazination methods for C-terminus sequencing. At the time of the experiment (1978), both methods were used in order to determine the amino acid composition and order of the sequence, including the discovery of a Glu-Glu linkage and the detection of alanine at the C-terminus. However, nowadays, either technique is sufficient to sequence the entire peptide. Production of umami taste On a molecular level, the umami taste is registered when molecules such as glutamate and aspartate bind to the ligand-binding domains of specialized taste receptors. Once activated, these receptors send electrical pulses that travel to the brain via sensory neurons. In 1989, Tamura et al. found that, by themselves, basic residues such as Lys-Gly and Lys-Lys produced sour and salty tastes in their dihydrochloride forms while acidic residues such as Asp-Glu- Glu and Lys-Gly produced sour and sweet tastes. However, the umami taste is produced by combinations of acidic and basic amino acid residues, such as Lys- Gly-Asp. More specifically, the umami taste found in BMP is generated by the combination of lysine at the N-terminus and the acidic amino acids (Asp-Glu- Glu) in the midsection of the peptide, which suggests that cations and anions play a role in the stimulation of taste receptors to produce the umami taste. However, other factors beyond the presence of certain amino acids can affect the taste response of the peptide. The intensity of the umami taste increases when the acidic peptide interacts with cations to form a salt. At a threshold value of 1.25 millimolar (mM), the Asp-Glu dipeptide generates the strongest umami taste when exposed to NaOH and subjected to a pH increase. Position of the amino acids also play a role in taste intensity, as a Glu-Asp dipeptide registers at a threshold value of 3.14 mM, meaning it would need a higher amount of the compound in order for a person to register the umami taste. Additionally, while a Lys-Gly-HCl analog would register a salty, umami taste at 1.22mM, a Gly-Lys-HCl analog registers a sour and sweet taste at 5.48mM. Thus, the research findings indicated that flavor can be modified in taste and strength through modification of acidic residues in peptides, opening up possibilities for the production of BMP-like peptides with greater taste intensity. Although its taste intensity does not change according to pH, BMP has been described to produce different tastes according to pH changes. Notably, it is reported to be sour at a pH of 3.5, umami at a pH of 6.5, and sweet, sour, and umami at a pH of 9.5. Viability for real-world application BMP peptide has been shown to remain stable, without breaking down, in high-heat pasteurization and sterilization conditions, making it possible for potential use for culinary purposes. Those advocating for the presence of BMP's flavor-enhancing umami taste report that its taste is similar to that of monosodium glutamate. Consequently, BMP possesses potential for large-scale commercialization in the food industry. However, the primary obstacle is the cost of mass production associated with the peptide. Currently, the main modes of production for specific flavor peptides such as BMP are chemical and enzymatic synthesis, both of which involve high production costs.

The idea for the program was a throwback to the Jeffersonian ideal of a back-to-the-land movement, popularized by Americans who promoted small-scale subsistence farming as an antidote to economic exploitation and the alienation of modern life. The idea gained strength in the 1920s among a wide variety of progressive organizations, including church-related groups such as the American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) which was the social services arm of the Quakers. During the 1920s, the AFSC had become deeply concerned with the violence that resulted from labor strife, particularly in the bituminous coal fields of Appalachia. So AFSC volunteers traveled to the bituminous-coal regions in West Virginia and Pennsylvania to help the families of striking and unemployed coal miners. The AFSC also believed in the necessity of economic and social justice as a means of insuring lasting peace in this section of the United States. To that end, it clothed and fed the families of unemployed miners during strikes, and later launched subsistence gardening and vocational retraining programs. After the onset of the Great Depression, these experiences placed the AFSC in the forefront of the movement for cooperative communities, so much so that the United States Secretary of the Interior Harold L. Ickes recruited AFSC staff to guide its subsistence homesteads program. The Great Depression was an opportunity to put these ideals into action. Supporters lobbied for the creation of a government-sponsored resettlement program that would place unemployed industrial workers in farmstead communities. Promoted as a relief measure, it quickly became weighted with the much more ambitious goal of cooperative living. In 1934, Interior Secretary Ickes named Milburn Wilson to head the newly created \\"Division of Subsistence Homesteads\\". Wilson, in turn, selected the AFSC's Clarence Pickett to help administer the program. As the AFSC's executive secretary, Pickett already had overseen vocational reeducation and cooperative farm programs for unemployed coal miners in West Virginia. The AFSC's work supplied the prototype for the federal program. In the years that followed, AFSC lent its support to the federal program and later sponsored its own cooperative community, Penn-Craft in Fayette County. Although the government opened its program to broad segments of the unemployed, the division was especially keen on it reaching bituminous coal miners. Geographically isolated and dominated by a single employer, the residents of most patch towns were especially vulnerable once employment evaporated. So the division designed the homestead program to give miners and their families an opportunity to become economically independent by working the land, which, in theory, would also free them from the boom/bust cycle of industrial capitalism. Once the division had identified its target populations, the federal government began buying large parcels of land for subdivision into individual homesteads for up to 300 families. Encouraging home ownership through a rent-to-own program, the program's administrators expected residents to grow or raise everything they needed to survive, but they also hoped that the new communities would lure local industries that would in turn provide jobs and needed income. =Political opposition= Although the project faced few political hurdles, the design of the houses for Norvelt and other subsistence farmstead communities set off a debate that revealed top government officials' contrasting ambitions for the program. Both President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Interior Secretary Ickes believed that the houses should be constructed to minimal standards, without electricity and running water, as befit a relief program. But program director Milburn Wilson and First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt insisted that the homes be furnished with plumbing, electric lights, and other modern conveniences. Senator Harry F. Byrd, a Democrat from Virginia, criticized such features as an \\"extravagance\\" for \\"simple mountain folk,\\" but Wilson and the First Lady prevailed. Both argued that the project, as a demonstration project, should afford its residents with homes that would elevate their standard of living. Building Norvelt In April 1934, federal officials acquired of farmland in Mount Pleasant Township, and announced construction of the Westmoreland Homesteads. Following Division guidelines, local architect Paul Bartholomew designed the planned community's buildings and its overall layout. On he arranged 254 individual lots, ranging in size from 1.7 to , in six, mostly curvilinear sections. Each lot was to feature a simply designed, -story Cape Cod. Originally, the houses were available in 4- to 6-room models, with a living room, eat-in kitchen, utility room, bathroom and bedroom space. Utilities included water and electricity. The remaining Bartholomew reserved for a cooperative farm, a schoolhouse, playground, post office, and other common buildings. These original depression-era Cape Cod‚Äìstyle homes are called \\"Norvelt Houses\\" by the locals. A six-room house on more than sold for $2131.28, a price that reflected annual mortgage payments of $212.50, which was one-fourth of the prospective purchasers' estimated annual cash income of $850, and a 40-year mortgage at 3% interest.\\"Our Community Booster Day,\\" U.S. Department of Agriculture, Resettlement Administration, Resettlement Division, \\"Justification for Westmoreland Homesteads, SH-PA3\\" (26 May 1937), Box 51, Public Housing Administration, Record Group 207, National Archives, cited in \\"Photographs Written Historical and Architectural Data,\\" National Historic Buildings Survey, National Park Service, Department of the Interior, HABS No. PA-5923. Over 1,850 applied for the government properties, which spanned nearly 1,500 acres. Two hundred and fifty four families received houses. Pickett helped establish the first American Friends Service Committee work camp in, what would become Norvelt, to help the Homesteads project with the construction of a reservoir and ditch to hold a water main for the community. In the summer of 1934, 55 young volunteers contributed 10,000 hours at Norvelt by digging a ditch one-and-a-half miles long and constructing a 260,000-gallon reservoir. The directors of this work camp were Mildred and Wilmer Young, who later led several experiments with cooperative enterprises in Mississippi and South Carolina. The first 1,200 residents were broadly representative of the region's ethnic and racial diversity. As they arrived, heads of households were put to work building the houses they would later occupy. Three years later, Westmoreland Homesteads was the largest of President Roosevelt's 92 model subsistence homesteads that provided relief for displaced miners and industrial workers. Basically the government purchased the land and people built their own homes on a lease-to-purchase agreement. Families rented their homes from the government for $12 to $14 a month, which was applied to the future purchase price of the house. By 1946, all the renters had purchased their homes. These early homes had everything a family would need to survive. These amenities included a grape arbor, 3-4 acres of land to plant a garden, and chicken coops. To make construction as efficient and cost-effective as possible, the division assigned crews to a single, specific construction task, such as digging the foundation or installing flooring‚Äîthus anticipating the mass building methods that would characterize large-scale residential developments such as Levittown after World War II‚Äîand applied most of workers' wages directly to the cost of their homesteads. After a resident's home was built, the government then provided each family with a wheelbarrow, rake, hoe and shovel. Mounds of earth were then dumped in front of the houses, and the tenants prepared their own lawns. Families were also expected to paint their own homes. Their choices of paint were white, gray or yellow. In May 1935, the first families began moving into Westmoreland Homesteads, and the task of creating a community began. Under the direction of a community manager, homesteaders established garden plots and raised livestock, including hogs and chickens. Some families produced enough to sell their surplus at a market, but for most, subsistence farming failed to meet their needs. To remedy the situation, in 1939, administrators at the Division, now under the \\"Rural Resettlement Administration\\", approved a loan for the construction of a small garment factory on site. Administered by the \\"Cooperative Association\\", a non- profit entity which also operated a cooperative store and a community health center, the garment factory by 1940 employed around 150 men and women. Eleanor Roosevelt's visit and legacy On May 21, 1937, First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt visited Westmoreland Homesteads to mark the arrival of the community's final homesteader. Accompanying her on the trip was the wife of United States Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau Jr.. \\"I am no believer in paternalism. I do not like charities,\\" she had said earlier. But cooperative communities such as Westmoreland Homesteads, she went on, offered an alternative to \\"our rather settled ideas\\" that could \\"provide equality of opportunity for all and prevent the recurrence of a similar disaster [depression] in the future.\\" Residents were so taken by the First Lady's personal expression of interest in the program that they promptly agreed to rename the community in her honor. (The new town name, Norvelt, was a combination of the last syllables in her names: EleaNOR RooseVELT.) Support from many high-level politicians helped Norvelt survive until 1944, when the federal government disbanded the homestead program and dispersed its assets. Most residents had by this time managed to purchase their homes and property. By 1950, the cooperative store and farm had shut down, but the garment factory, under private ownership of AMCO of Norvelt, continued for many years. The garment factory, on Mount Pleasant Road in Norvelt, is owned and operated by Union Apparel Incorporated, which manufactures and exports men's and boy's tailored dress and sport coats as well as women's, misses' and juniors' suits and coats. Norvelt was born out of the socialist idea of community farming and of a need to eliminate the strains of capitalism. However, it wasn't long before many in the community abandoned working on the government farms in exchange for higher paying jobs in the private sector. Residents took up jobs in neighboring Latrobe, Greensburg and Mount Pleasant. Norvelt never achieved the lofty goals that Eleanor Roosevelt and others had invested in it. As a relief measure, however, it was a success. In 2002, Norvelt's handful of surviving original pioneers expressed their appreciation for their town during the festivities for the historic marker designation. Evidence of the town's original name is still visible. The village's laundromat still carries the name Homestead. The entrance to Roosevelt Hall reads Westmoreland Homestead's \\"Norvelt\\" Volunteer Fire Department. Education Hurst High School Hurst High School was built in 1905, and has been used as a high school and a junior high school. The school was an important stop on the Latrobe line of the West Penn Railways' electric interurban railway system. The distinctive orange cars carried many Hurst students to and from school. The Hurst name in Mount Pleasant Township dates from colonial times. It is understood that the land on which Hurst High School was built was owned by the Hurst family and given to the School District. In 1961, the Mount Pleasant Township and Borough districts were joined and Hurst and Ramsay High Schools became the present Mt. Pleasant Area Jr. and Sr. High School. Today the old Hurst High School houses many small businesses, offices, and shops. Norvelt Elementary School Norvelt Elementary School, founded in 1938, is a primary school that is a part of the Mount Pleasant Area School District. It is the largest structure in Norvelt. It was originally built as a replica of Independence Hall in Philadelphia. The structure is a two-story brick building which was renovated and expanded in the early 1990s. It sits on top of a hill in the middle of \\"B\\" section, overlooking the fire department and post office. Norvelt School has a wide lawn in front with a baseball field and playground equipment. The flat grassy lawn at the base of the hill is about wide and deep. The Norvelt Colts use the open space for football practices. Other use the space for golf practice, dog walking, or jogging. The original Norvelt schoolhouse, later became the Norvelt Fireman's Social Club, once Norvelt Elementary was built in 1960. The first school that was built was not big enough to accommodate all of the children, so some students went to class in the morning and some in the afternoon. School lunches provided to students by the government usually consisted of bean soup and peanut butter and honey sandwiches. The club was demolished and the organization moved to a new facility that was added on to Roosevelt Hall during the late 1990s. The new Norvelt Fireman's Club-Roosevelt Hall is located only a few yards away from the old school site. Public services Fire Department The Norvelt Fire Department is an all- volunteer fire department. The department is on Mount Pleasant Road. Roosevelt Hall The Norvelt firefighter's hall is named Roosevelt Hall in honor of Eleanor Roosevelt. It is primarily used for wedding receptions. Post office Norvelt's US Post Office branch was originally across the street from the garment factory. Today it is on Norvelt's main strip in a renovated section of building that burned down in the early 1980s. The new post office is located only a few yards from the fire department. Sports and recreation Baseball Norvelt is the home to PONY League Field which fields Little League and PONY League Baseball games throughout the summer. A second baseball field is located below the hill in front of Norvelt Elementary School. This field was used by workers at the garment factory, who field a team each year. It was also used by the members of the volunteer fire department, who also fielded an annual team. Football =Hurst Hurricane football= Hurst High School fielded an annual football team, the Hurricanes. The team lost one game during their 1925 and 1926 seasons. The coach of the Hurst Hurricane Football team was Robert Mitinger, Sr., a star guard in 1918 from Greensburg and a member of Lafayette College's 1921 National Championship team. He and his brother, assistant Ed Mitinger, coached at Hurst starting in 1925. Mitinger's son, Robert Mitinger was an All-American tight end and defensive end for Penn State in 1961. He was drafted by the San Diego Chargers and named the 1962 Chargers' team Rookie of the Year. He played 42 games at linebacker for the Chargers for seven seasons (1962‚Äì1964, 1966, 1968), including their 51-10 rout of the Boston Patriots at Balboa Stadium in the 1963 AFL Championship, the high point of the team's 44-year history. The Robert B. Mitinger Award, named in his honor, is presented to Penn State Nittany Lions football players who personify courage, character and social responsibility. Hurst High fielded a magnificent unscored-on perfect record team in 1927. The team's tackle was John Murtha. His son, also named John Murtha, has been a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, representing a district based in Johnstown. Hurst's 1931 team won the Western Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic League (WPIAL) championship. The 1938 Hurst team won the WPIAL title again. Three members of the 1938 Hurst Hurricanes reached the National Football League, with the Pittsburgh Steelers. Joe Glamp and Walt Gorinski would go on to play college football at Louisiana State University, while Joe Cibulas would play tackle for the Duquesne Dukes. In 1942, Hurst again reached the championship heights, playing a 14-14 tie with Dormont in the title playoff. In 1959, Peter Billey, of the Hurst Hurricanes, finished second in total scoring for Westmoreland County with 121 points. Billey would go on to play college football at the University of Pittsburgh where he played on the 1963 Pitt team that finished #3 in the nation. In 1961, the Mount Pleasant Township and Borough districts were joined and Hurst and Ramsay High Schools closed. The new combined school became Mount Pleasant Area High School. Since 1965, the football field of Hurst Stadium has been the Home of the Mount Pleasant Junior Football Association. =The Norvelt Colts= Norvelt is also the Home of the Norvelt Colts Football Team of the Mount Pleasant Area Junior Football League. The team's motto is \\"The Area's Team\\" that was inspired by the Dallas Cowboys' use of the term \\"America's Team\\". The motto was established after the Colts dominated opponents and won league championships in 1990 and 1991. The Norvelt Colts currently have 12 league championships since 1965, second to only the rival United Steelers, who have 17. Golf Norvelt Golf Course is located at the Norvelt Golf Club located on Pennsylvania SR 981. The course has water hazards on various holes. The fairways are narrow, and the greens are average sized. It opened in 1968 and was designed by Larry S. Liprando of the Liprando Development Company Steve Bosdosh, rated by Golf Magazine as one of the top 100 teachers in the United States, is a native of Norvelt. He is a PGA golf professional and director of instruction at Four Streams Golf Club in Beallsville MD. and some of his students have included LPGA Tour players Jackie Gallagher-Smith and Katie Peterson-Parker. Geography Sections The two main areas of Norvelt are \\"A\\" section and \\"B\\" section, connected into one loose circle made up of East Laurel Circle and West Laurel Circle running on either side of Mt. Pleasant Road. Both circles are built into the rolling hills, and the tree- lined roads. Waterways Norvelt has many small waterways. The largest is Sewickley Creek. The Sewickley stretches through Mammoth, Trauger, Calumet, and Norvelt. The Sewickley Creek Watershed Association, a non-profit organization monitors recommends and implements actions essential to the conservation of the Sewickley Creek watershed area for recreational purposes. Norvelt also has many smaller creeks, most running through it. The small creeks are lined with stone blocks, and run parallel to the village's circular streets and through the yards. In literature The Jack Gantos book Dead End in Norvelt, set in Norvelt, won the 2012 Newbery Medal for the best children's book of 2011, as well as the 2012 Scott O'Dell Award for Historical Fiction. Gantos also wrote a sequel, entitled From Norvelt to Nowhere, published in 2013.

The 2-32 was designed to be the highest performance two-place glider available, when it first flew in 1962. The 2-32 has been used as a tourist glider, trainer, cross-country and high-altitude sailplane and has set many US and world records. A total of 87 aircraft were completed. Design and development The SGS 2-32 was conceived as a mass-produced sailplane of modest performance to act as a step-up from the SGU 2-22 trainer then in common use in North America. After careful examination of the potential market, the company decided to produce a higher performance sailplane with a greater wingspan instead. The 2-32 design was started in 1961 and completed with certification under type certificate G1EA on 19 June 1964. The 2-32 is all-metal, with a semi-monocoque aluminum fuselage and cantilever wings of 57 foot (17.37 m) span. It has top-and-bottom divebrakes and an all-flying stabilator tail. The aircraft seats two or three, with one seat in the front cockpit and a double bench seat in the back suitable for two smaller people of each, maximum. The aircraft is often described a \\"2 seater\\". The ability to carry two passengers, plus its complete and comfortable interior has made the 2-32 a popular aircraft with commercial glider operators for conducting tourist flights. The ability to carry two passengers doubled profitability for rides. The first customer aircraft were delivered in 1964, shortly after certification was completed. The type certificate is currently held by K & L Soaring of Cayuta, New York. K & L Soaring now provides all parts and support for the Schweizer line of sailplanes. Derivative designs The SGS 2-32 has been the basis of several derivative designs, including: *Bede BD-2 long range experimental aircraft designed by Jim Bede *Lockheed QT-2, QT-2PC, QT-2PCII, X-26B (see Schweizer X-26 Frigate) *Lockheed YO-3 quiet surveillance aircraft *LTV L450F prototype quiet reconnaissance aircraft *LTV XQM-93 turboprop a remotely piloted aircraft *Ryson STP-1 Swallow motor glider *Schweizer X-26 Frigate United States Navy yaw/roll coupling trainer Operational history As soon as it entered service many pilots realized that this high performance two- place sailplane would be ideal to break many of the two-place records previously set by lower performance gliders. At one time the 2-32 held the two-place speed records over 100 km, 300 km and 500 km courses, as well as many distance, out and return and altitude records in both the men's and women's categories. 2-32s were also flown in the 1964 US Nationals. Some of the records set by pilots flying SGS 2-32s include: *World record two-place out and return flight, 404 miles (654 km), May 23, 1970, Joe Lincoln and Cris Crowl. Lincoln's 2-32, named Cibola, had special longer wings of span installed that increased performance further. *World record two-place speed over 100 km (63 miles) Triangle, 74 mph (120 km/h), 1971, Joe Lincoln. *World record two-place feminine absolute altitude 35,463 feet (10,809 m) and altitude gain 24,545 feet (7848 m), 5 March 1975, Babs Nutt. In May 2014 there were still 58 2-32s registered in the USA and one in Canada. In USAF service at the United States Air Force Academy the 2-32 was known as the TG-5. Aircraft on display The National Soaring Museum has two SGS 2-32s in its collection, N2767Z and N8600R, the prototype.

It stretches for south from Times Plaza, which is the triangle intersection created by Atlantic and Flatbush Avenues in Downtown Brooklyn, to Shore Road and the Belt Parkway in Bay Ridge. While southwestern Brooklyn is well served by expressways, Fourth Avenue provides an alternate for local traffic as it directly links the neighborhoods of Park Slope, Sunset Park and Bay Ridge with Downtown Brooklyn. Traffic signals along the avenue are coordinated for green wave in the peak direction. Description Fourth Avenue begins at Times Plaza, the triangle intersection it forms with Flatbush and Atlantic Avenues at the foot of the Williamsburgh Savings Bank Tower and Atlantic Terminal in Downtown Brooklyn. The avenue extends south with three traffic lanes in each direction and a one-lane-wide concrete divider that provides a left-turn lane. The concrete divider is actually part of the ventilation system for the BMT Fourth Avenue Line, which lies directly underneath. While six lanes are provided, only four lanes get full use, since the outer two are used by double-parked vehicles and as a right-turn lane.Cartography from Google Maps On its course through Park Slope, Fourth Avenue is home to several condominiums and homes but is dominated by service stations and automotive repair centers. Upon entering Sunset Park, Fourth Avenue passes under the Prospect Expressway (NY 27) and offers indirect access to it through local side streets. The avenue continues to serve the automotive trade as far as the street numbered in the low 40s, where it becomes flanked by large wall-to-wall apartment buildings. After crossing under the Gowanus Expressway viaduct into Bay Ridge, the arterial boulevard gives way to a four- lane street bordered by four- to five- story apartment buildings until it reaches Shore Road and the Belt Parkway under the Verrazano Narrows Bridge.  History  The avenue was paved in the 1890s as a grand parkway resembling Manhattan's Fourth Avenue, which was later rebuilt and renamed to Park Avenue. The Fourth Avenue in Brooklyn was rebuilt after 1910 to accommodate more traffic. On October 25, 1962, Mayor Robert F. Wagner Jr. requested that the New York City Board of Estimate approve an expenditure of $724,572 for the reconstruction of subway structures and entrances along the Fourth Avenue subway line in order to accommodate the widening of Fourth Avenue between 60th Street and Atlantic Avenue, which was to be accomplished by narrowing the street's sidewalks. At the time of the request, 80% of the work on the project was completed. Work had started on the project, which cost $1 million, several months earlier. The contract that the Mayor had requested approval for would have relocated vault lights, gratings, entrances and exits at 56th Street and 49th Street, and at the 45th Street, 53rd Street and 59th Street stations. Protected bike lanes, separated from vehicular traffic by a lane of parking, were proposed for Fourth Avenue in 2017 in an attempt to improve cycling infrastructure in New York City. The first bike lanes were added between 60th and 64th Streets within Sunset Park in 2018, followed by the section between 1st and 15th Streets in Park Slope in early 2019. Due to ongoing reconstruction work on the Fourth Avenue subway tunnel, the section between 60th and 38th Streets could not receive bike lanes until the reconstruction was completed. In August 2019, following several cyclist deaths citywide, the NYCDOT announced that the remainder of Fourth Avenue between 38th and 60th Streets would receive protected bike lanes by late 2020. Churches Fourth Avenue United Methodist Church The borough has a thoroughfare named Church Avenue (named for an 18th-century church), which, contrary to its name, does not rival the large number of later churches located along Fourth Avenue. At Fourth Avenue's intersection with 54th Street in Sunset Park, there are four houses of worship either directly at the corner of the intersection or within a building of it. Two of the churches stand side by side. Public transportation The BMT Fourth Avenue Line () of the New York City Subway runs the length of Fourth Avenue. Stations are located at Atlantic Avenue, Union Street, Ninth Street, Prospect Avenue, 25th Street, 36th Street, 45th Street, 53rd Street, 59th Street, Bay Ridge Avenue, 77th Street, 86th Street, and 95th Street, with express stations at Atlantic Avenue, 36th Street, and 59th Street. MTA Regional Bus Operations operates several routes, none of which serve the avenue significantly. The Limited route has the longest stretch, traveling southbound on 4th Avenue from Atlantic Avenue to Prospect Expressway. The also use the avenue for short stretches. The also stop at the south end of the avenue.

Early career Born in Newry, he was the son of Edward Corry (d. 1792), sometime Member of Parliament,E. M. Johnston-Liik, 'Corry, Isaac (1753‚Äì1813)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2008 accessed 5 Dec 2010 and Catharine Bristow. His cousin was the writer Catherine Dorothea Burdett. He was educated at the Royal School, Armagh, where his contemporaries included Viscount Castlereagh, and later at Trinity College, Dublin, from which he graduated in 1773. On 18 October 1771 he was admitted to the Middle Temple and called to the bar at King's Inns in 1779. Member of Parliament In 1776 Corry succeeded his father as Member of Parliament for Newry, sitting in the Irish House of Commons until the Act of Union in 1801. From 1782 to 1789 he served as equerry to the Duke of Cumberland, being described in 1794 by Rt. Hon. Sylvester Douglas as \\"a well-bred man...He has no brogue...He once acted as a sort of groom of the bedchamber to the late Duke of Cumberland.\\" In 1798, he was also elected for Randalstown, but chose not to sit and in 1802, he was returned to the British House of Commons for Newry. He served as a Whig at Westminster until 1806. It was written in 1783 that Corry would expect to enter high office, given that \\"he lives expensively and does not pursue his profession, which is the law.\\" In 1788 he became Clerk of the [Irish] Ordnance. The following year Corry was appointed a commissioner of the revenue. Finally in 1799 he was appointed Irish Chancellor of the Exchequer and a Lord High Treasurer of Ireland in place of Sir John Parnell, who quarrelled violently with Pitt over the projected union, which he categorically refused to support. In 1795 he became a Privy Councillor. Later years In 1802 Corry was dismissed from the Exchequer and replaced by John Foster (later Lord Oriel), he was awarded, however, ¬£2,000 p.a. in compensation. In 1806 the changes in ownership of the Newry estates altered Corry's position; the lands had passed to a senior line of the Needham family and Lady Downshire, decided to return his brother General Francis Needham, 1st Earl of Kilmorey at the general election. Corry did not have the funds needed, in excess of ¬£5000, to purchase a seat elsewhere. However, Lady Downshire was inclined to support the Grenville ministry and came to a formal agreement with Corry to give him ¬£1000 towards his expenses should he be successful in Newry, and, if not, to bring him in for another borough. Corry failed against the Needham interest in Newry, but a seat at Newport, Isle of Wight, was purchased for him, with ¬£4000 from Lady Downshire, and Corry was appointed to the Board of Trade. Six months later Grenville's ministry had fallen and there was another general election. Corry stood, again unsuccessfully, for Newry. Corry was unmarried but had a long-term relationship with Jane Symms, they had six children (three sons and three daughters); his daughter Ann married Lt.-Col. Henry Westenra, the brother of the first Baron Rossmore.http://thepeerage.com/p3363.htm#i33625 Thepeerage.com Corry's residence in Newry was the Abbey Yard, now a school,http://www.ni- environment.gov.uk/content-databases-buildview?id=4250&js;=true NI Environment Agency Historic Building Details and Derrymore House, Bessbrook,http://www.newryandmourne.gov.uk/leisure/Attractions/Historical/Derrymore.aspx Newry & Mourne Council, information on Derrymore which he had inherited from his father and sold in 1810. It is now the property of the National Trust. During Corry's life, a road was constructed from near the main entrance of Derrymore House around Newry and linked up with the Dublin Road on the southern side of the town primarily for Corry's use. This road subsequently became known as \\"The Chancellor's Road,\\" as a result of Corry's term as the Irish Chancellor of the Exchequer. A local legend has it that the road was constructed after an incident in which Corry's stagecoach was stoned while passing through Newry by people angry at an unpopular window tax he had introduced. The road has retained this name but it was cut in half by the Newry by-pass in the mid-1990s, however as a result of works associated with the new A1 dual carriageway the two-halves of the road have now been reconnected. He died at his house in Merrion Square, Dublin and is buried in St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin.

Biography Alexandru Odobescu, portrait by George Demetrescu Mirea He was born in Bucharest, the second child of General Ioan Odobescu and his wife Ecaterina. After attending Saint Sava College and, from 1850, a Paris lyc√©e, he took the baccalaur√©at in 1853 and studied literature and archaeology at the University of Paris, graduating two years later. In 1858, he married Pavel Kiselyov's daughter Alexandra (Sa≈üa) Prejbeanu; they had one daughter, Ioana. He was often apart from his wife and had affairs with other women. Odobescu served as cabinet minister for religion and education in 1863, as head clerk at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1865, and as prosecutor at the Court of Appeal. In 1870, he travelled in Switzerland and Italy, in connection with his discovery and description of the Pietroasele treasure, a collection of objects made from precious metals, of Gothic origin, found on Romanian territory; he also travelled to several other countries, including Denmark, Russia and Turkey. He opposed the tendency toward artificially Latinizing the literary Romanian language. He was elected to the Romanian Academy in 1870 and was professor of archaeology at the University of Bucharest from 1874, the year he was named chairman of the National Theatre Bucharest. He served as secretary of the Romanian legation at Paris in 1882, was principal of a teacher-training institute in Bucharest, and principal of the National Educational Institute in 1892. Poor, sick with gout, separated from his wife and daughter, around 1891, he fell passionately in love with Hortensia Racovi≈£ƒÉ, a geography professor thirty years his junior. She rejected a marriage proposal made by Odobescu's wife, and he committed suicide by morphine overdose in Bucharest in 1895.

This allows the user to post-process the received data to produce a more accurate result -- usually with other data unknown to the original receiver, such as better models of the atmospheric conditions at time of measurement. The final output of a navigation receiver is usually its position, speed or other related physical quantities. However, the calculation of these quantities are based on a series of measurements from one or more satellite constellations. Although receivers calculate positions in real time, in many cases it is interesting to store intermediate measures for later use. RINEX is the standard format that allows the management and disposal of the measures generated by a receiver, as well as their off-line processing by a multitude of applications, whatever the manufacturer of both the receiver and the computer application. The RINEX format is designed to evolve over time, adapting to new types of measurements and new satellite navigation systems. The first RINEX version was developed by W. Gurtner in 1989 and published by W. Gurtner and G. Mader in the CSTG GPS Bulletin of September/October 1990. Since 1993 the RINEX 2 is available, which has been revised and adopted several times. RINEX enables storage of measurements of pseudorange, carrier-phase, Doppler and signal-to-noise from GPS (including GPS modernization signals e.g. L5 and L2C), GLONASS, Galileo, Beidou, along with data from EGNOS and WAAS satellite based augmentation systems (SBAS), QZSS, simultaneously. RINEX version 3.02 was submitted in April 2013 and contain new observation codes from GPS or Galileo systems. The most recent version is RINEX 3.04 from December 2018. Although not part of the RINEX format, the Hatanaka compression scheme is commonly used to reduced the size of RINEX files, resulting in an ASCII-based CompactRINEX or CRINEX format. It uses higher-order time differences to reduce the number of characters needed to store time data.

LA 3152 spans in a south to north direction and is known locally as South Clearview Parkway and Clearview Parkway. Route description LA 3152 begins at an interchange with U.S. 90 and LA 48 (Jefferson Highway) at the east bank base of the Huey P. Long Bridge in Elmwood. LA 3152 continues northward along South Clearview Parkway, intersecting with LA 3139 (Earhart Expressway) via an interchange. At U.S. 61 (Airline Drive), the local name changes to Clearview Parkway, and LA 3152 continues to an interchange with I-10. Clearview Parkway continues northward across Veterans Memorial Boulevard and eventually ends at Lake Pontchartrain. LA 3152 is a divided, six-lane highway for its entire length. History Clearview Parkway began as a main thoroughfare through the Bridgedale subdivision which opened in 1925 during construction of the Airline Highway between Shrewsbury (Metairie) and Kenner. In 1930, it was designated as State Route 1245 in the pre-1955 Louisiana Highway system. The other main thoroughfare, Transcontinental Drive (State Route 1246), was intended to be extended south to Jefferson Highway (State Route 1) to connect with the Huey P. Long Bridge then in the planning stages. These plans never came to fruition, and the Bridgedale area would not be not directly connected to the bridge for almost fifty years. The route became LA 611-10 in the 1955 Louisiana Highway renumbering and assumed its present number in 1972. The extension of Clearview Parkway, complete with railroad overpass, south from Airline Highway to the Huey P. Long Bridge at Jefferson Highway, opened in June 1973 and was designated as South Clearview Parkway. The Earhart Expressway (LA 3139) interchange was partially completed in the 1970s as part of the Clearview Parkway-Dickory Avenue section of the expressway. The overpass was completed in June 1986 along with the final link of the expressway between Cleary Avenue and Clearview Parkway. LA 3152 originally included only the part of Clearview Parkway/South Clearview Parkway between the Earhart Expressway and West Metairie Avenue. In 2010, the route was extended on both the northern and southern ends to its present termini at U.S. 90/LA 48 and I-10.

He was educated at Jesus College, Oxford, where he matriculated in May 1743 - he was said to be 17 years old at that time. He obtained his Bachelor of Arts degree in January 1747 and was elected to a fellowship of the college in the same year. He retained his fellowship until 1783, and also served as Vice-Principal of the college from 1762 until 1783 (beginning when Thomas Pardo was Principal, continuing in post throughout the principalship of Humphrey Owen and into the time of Joseph Hoare). He was also awarded the higher degrees of Bachelor of Divinity (1756) and Doctor of Divinity (1760). He was ordained deacon on 23 July 1749 at Cuddesdon by the Bishop of Oxford, Thomas Secker. He was ordained priest by Secker on 10 June 1750 at Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford. He was rector of the parish of Besselsleigh, Oxfordshire from at least 1770. In 1783, Edwards resigned his fellowship, having been appointed by the college as rector of Aston Clinton, Buckinghamshire on 31 July 1782. His time at Aston Clinton was limited, since one source gives his date of death as 2 September 1783, and a letter written by Samuel Johnson confirms that Edwards was dead by 1784. Edwards and Samuel Johnson were friends and exchanged letters - Johnson described Edwards as \\"my convivial friend\\" and stayed with Edwards at Jesus College on a visit to Oxford in 1782. Edwards had an interest in matters connected with Wales, but his primary concern was Greek literature. He prepared an edition of Xenophon's Memorabilia, and published an essay on Socratic ethics in 1773 in the light of Xenophon's writings. His edition was printed with the Greek text and a Latin version before his death; the publication was completed by his friend Henry Owen in 1785.

Life Owen was born in the parish of Llaniestyn, on the Lleyn peninsula in North Wales. He was educated at Botwnnog grammar school (as was his cousin John Owen, who later became Bishop of St Davids). From there, he proceeded to Jesus College, Oxford where he matriculated in 1873. In 1877, he graduated with a B.A. degree in Literae Humaniores, obtaining his M.A. in 1882. In about 1878, he became headmaster of the Willow Street Academy, a private school in Oswestry, Shropshire. In the 1881 census, the school was recorded as having fourteen boarders aged from ten to twenty four, and a schoolmaster and a housekeeper in addition to Owen. The school‚Äôs success led, in 1883, to the purchase of new premises--a house called The Lawn, on Church Street, Oswestry, that had previously been the residence of members of a local wealthy family--and the school was known as Oswestry High School, or the Boys High School. Owen remained as headmaster and the excellent record of the school led to it drawing pupils from across Wales. The Welsh Intermediate Education Act was passed in 1889, and Owen was co-secretary of the joint conferences set up to establish the schemes to be implemented at county level. In 1896, the Central Welsh Board for Intermediate Education was established, with Arthur Humphreys-Owen (Member of Parliament for Montgomeryshire) as its first chairman and John Viriamu Jones (the first vice-chancellor of the University of Wales) as vice-chairman. The Board had the responsibility of overseeing the Welsh Intermediate Schools, and this was done through an annual examination and inspection. Owen was appointed as the Board‚Äôs first chief inspector in 1896. He held the position until 1915, when illness compelled his retirement, and was regarded as having held the office \\"with exceptional ability and conscientiousness\\". He was succeeded in the post by William Edwards, a former fellow of Jesus College. After his enforced retirement, he moved to Colwyn Bay on the coast of North Wales, where he died on 14 March 1920; he was buried in the cemetery at Llandrillo-yn-Rhos.

The band plays pregame and halftime shows for all home games of the Louisiana Ragin' Cajuns football team. History The band has given the Ragin' Cajuns an unofficial second fight song, Respect, as made famous by Aretha Franklin, by playing the song at every football game since the early 1970s. The band performed at Governor Kathleen Blanco's inauguration in 2004. It also traveled to New York, New York to perform in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in 2005. During spring break in 2009, the band traveled to the United Kingdom to perform. They held performances at Princes Street Gardens in Edinburgh, Scotland, and at Victoria Embankment Gardens in the City of Westminster in London, England and recently in 2010 performed in Madrid, Spain as part of the annual Three King's Parade and was the first American marching band to appear on national Spanish television. The Pride has recently been invited to return to the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in 2012 to represent the Cajuns once again making them only a handful of college marching bands to ever be invited back. Pregame The Pride of Acadiana performs a pregame show before the games. The band will start behind the student section of Cajun Field, marching around three sides of the stadium until it gets to the main entrance. There it will perform a pep rally with the help of the cheerleaders. It'll then start playing \\"Do What Ya Wanna\\" as it turns and heads into the stadium. The band then files out and down into the tunnel, where the members line up for the pregame field show. For 2013, the band begins pregame by peak stepping out of the tunnel and onto the field at a quick tempo to a drum cadence. Then, they perform short snippets of Aretha Franklin's \\"Respect\\" (the Respect Fanfare) before marching down the field to the Louisiana Fight Song, eventually forming a large \\"UL.\\" The band then performs the Alma Mater and the Star Spangled Banner. Afterwards, the band performs the songs \\"Jambalaya\\" and \\"You Are My Sunshine\\" forming a large fleur de lis, as the world's largest Louisiana flag is displayed. Then, after forming a \\"tunnel,\\" the band plays the Louisiana Fight Song once again as the team enters the field. Afterwards, the band plays \\"Respect off the field\\", where they play \\"Respect\\" while marching to the away side of the field and gathering by the band's section in the stands. Halftime The Pride of Acadiana usually prepares multiple marching shows for each football season, which they will alternate between games. For these shows, the band will file down to the field and get in position to start the show before the half. The band performs to the home side, although occasionally it will turn and perform a couple of songs to the student side. After the performance, the band plays \\"Respect\\" off the field and returns to their seats. A view of the Pride of Acadiana marching band playing the fight song in the Louisiana Ragin Cajuns set during pregame at Cajun Field. Exhibitions The University marching band is the host of the annual Louisiana Showcase of Marching Bands, which brings bands from more than 30 high schools from around the state to compete at one festival. The Pride of Acadiana ends the festival with an exhibition performance of the year's shows. The band also hosts Drums Across Cajun Field, an annual DCI exhibition that takes place before school starts, usually in July.

He was Member of Parliament for Helston on two occasions, but only made one speech in Parliament. He was later a successful chancery barrister, eventually becoming Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer. Life Richards was born on 5 November 1752 at Coed, Brithdir, near Dolgellau in Merionethshire. He was the eldest son of Thomas Richards and his wife, Catherine, whose brother (William Parry) was warden of Ruthin, Denbighshire. His grandfather, also called William Parry, was headmaster of Ruthin School and Richards was educated there. Richards then progressed to Oxford University, matriculating as a member of Jesus College, Oxford on 19 March 1771. He transferred to Wadham College, Oxford on 7 May 1773 and obtained his Bachelor of Arts degree on 10 October 1774. He then became a scholar at The Queen's College, Oxford, and after being appointed to a fellowship at Queen's on 17 December 1774, he was awarded his Master of Arts degree on 15 July 1777. In the meantime, Richards had become a member of the Inner Temple (being admitted on 10 May 1775) and he was called to the bar on 12 February 1780. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in February 1793 as a \\"Gentleman studious in Natural History\\". Political career In the 1796 general election, Richards was elected as one of the members of parliament for the constituency of Helston, Cornwall. He held the seat until March 1799, when he resigned in favour of Lord Francis Osborne, son of the Duke of Leeds who controlled the seat. He was re-elected at the May 1807 general election, resigning on 29 July 1807 in favour of Sir James Blackwood. During his parliamentary career, he supported the ministry of William Pitt the Younger but made only one reported speech, opposing the Quakers' Relief Bill on 24 February 1797 as unnecessary and inconvenient. Legal career Richards' main area of practice was in the Court of Chancery. He was one of the three registrars to the Prerogative Court of the Province of Canterbury from 1788 to 1800, and was appointed counsel to Queen Anne's Bounty in 1789. He became solicitor-general to Queen Charlotte (the wife of King George III) in 1794, becoming attorney-general to the queen in 1801 in succession to William Grant. He was appointed as a Bencher of Inner Temple in 1799, and held the positions of Reader (1804) and Treasurer (1806). He was a potential appointee to the newly created position of Vice-Chancellor of the Court of Chancery in 1812, since he was the senior chancery barrister who was not an MP, earning ¬£7,000 per year. He was led to believe by his friend Lord Eldon, the Lord Chancellor, that he would be appointed. However, Eldon instead bowed to party-political pressure and appointed the Attorney General, Thomas Plumer, to the new post. Richards was indignant, although he was appeased by his appointment as chief justice of the county palatine of Chester. He resigned that position when he was offered a position of Baron of the Exchequer in February 1814. He had refused this appointment in 1807, but he was now given to understand that he would in due course succeed as Chief Baron. The offer was apparently made when Lord Eldon tossed a note into court addressed to \\"Taffy\\". Richards was appointed a Serjeant-at-law on 26 February 1814 and was knighted by the Prince Regent at Carlton House on 11 May 1814. On the death of Sir Alexander Thomson, Richards became Chief Baron on 21 April 1817 and became a Privy Counsellor five days later. He helped clear the backlog of equity appeals and was regarded as a sound and capable judge. He presided over the trials of Jeremiah Brandreth, convicted of treason, and two of the Cato Street conspirators. He also acted as Lord Speaker when Lord Eldon was ill in January 1819. Family Richards married Catherine Humphreys, through whom Richards acquired an estate in Caerynwch, Merionethshire; he later became a Deputy Lieutenant of Merionethshire. He had eight sons and two daughters, and was known as \\"Stumpy Dick\\". His eldest son Richard Richards (known as \\"Double Dick\\") was MP for the constituency of Merioneth from 1836 to 1852. Robert Richards and Griffith Richards (the third and sixth sons) were both appointed Queen's Counsel and both, like their father, became benchers of Inner Temple, as did a grandson and a great-grandson of Sir Richard Richards. Richards died on 11 November 1823 and was buried in the Inner Temple vault; his wife was buried there also on 12 October 1825.

It is in the Laggan district of East Donegal on the left bank of the River Foyle. It is in the civil parish of Taughboyne and barony of Raphoe North, on the R236 (Lifford‚ÄìNewtowncunningham) road where it overlaps the R265 (Carrigans‚Äì Raphoe) road. The village is about 12 km or 8 miles south of Derry. Architecture St Baithin's Church (popularly known as 'the Chapel'), the Catholic parish church in the village, was designed by E. W. Godwin, the mid-Victorian British architect. It is a neo-Gothic structure that was built between 1857 and 1860.Rowan, Alistair, The Buildings of Ireland: North West Ulster (popularly known as the Pevsner Guide to North West Ulster), P. 482. Yale University Press, New Haven and London, 2003. Originally published by Penguin, London, 1979. St Johnston Presbyterian Church, located on the Derry Road, is the other main structure within the village. Parts of this church, or kirk, may date back to around 1724. However, most of the present neo-Gothic structure was built in the early nineteenth century. The 'thin' neo-Gothic tower was built in 1849.Rowan, Alistair, The Buildings of Ireland: North West Ulster, P. 483. Yale University Press, New Haven and London, 2003. Originally published by Penguin, London, 1979. This kirk, which is owned by the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, was severely damaged by a lightning strike in the mid-1980s. The tower of the church was particularly damaged. The building, however, which serves the large Ulster Scots Presbyterian community in this part of The Laggan, had been fully restored by around 1990. History Mongavlin Castle (also known as Mongevlin Castle), a ruined castle, is located approximately 3 km south of the village. It was once a stronghold of the √ì Domhnaill (O'Donnell) clan, Kings of T√≠r Chonaill. In the very early seventeenth-century, Mongevlin was the chief residence of In√≠on Dubh (d. 1608), the daughter of both S√©amus Mac Dh√≤mhnaill, 6th Laird of Dunnyveg, an Islay-based Gaelic nobleman, and his wife, Lady Agnes Campbell; In√≠on Dubh was the mother of Red Hugh O'Donnell. When In√≠on Dubh came to Ulster to marry Sir Aodh mac Maghnusa √ì Domhnaill (Sir Hugh O'Donnell; c. 1540-c. 1600), she brought a force of 100 of the biggest men she could find in Scotland for protection. 80 of these were of the name Crawford. When Mongavlin was eventually abandoned, the Crawfords settled and married in the locality. Many of their descendants can still be found in the area to this day. On 23 July 1610, at the start of the Plantation of Ulster, Mongevlin Castle and its lands were granted to The 2nd Duke of Lennox (1574-1624), a Scottish nobleman. Lennox, who was already a peer in the Peerage of Scotland, was created The 1st Duke of Richmond in the Peerage of England in 1623, making him a duke twice over. On the death of the Duke on 16 February 1624 the title of Duke of Lennox and the castle and lands at Mongavlin passed to his brother Esm√©, 1st Earl of March (1579-1624), who now became (briefly) The 3rd Duke of Lennox. Esm√© had married The Hon. Katherine Clifton (c. 1592-1637) in 1609; she became The 2nd Baroness Clifton, suo jure, in 1618. After her husband Esm√©'s death in August 1624, Katherine, now Dowager Duchess of Lennox, then married The 2nd Earl of Abercorn (c. 1604-c. 1670), another Scottish nobleman, circa 1632. Unlike the Dukes of Lennox, Lord Abercorn had actually moved to Ulster, where he was now based. The centre of Lord Abercorn's estate was the nearby town of Strabane in West Tyrone. A borough was established at the site in the reign of King James VI & I during the Plantation of Ulster. St Johnstown Borough was a borough constituency in the Irish House of Commons from about 1619 to the Acts of Union 1800. The borough was a rotten borough and the settlement never more than a village. King James II & VII passed through on his way to the Siege of Derry in 1690. From St Johnston he sent a letter proposing surrender, which was rejected. St Johnston was one of several Protestant villages in eastern Donegal that would have been transferred to Northern Ireland, had the recommendations of the Irish Boundary Commission been enacted in 1925.

He was vicar of the parish of Chirk in north-east Wales for over thirty years, and during his time there he wrote a bi-lingual explanation of the Creed, Ten Commandments and the Lord's Prayer for the use of the inhabitants of Chirk and the surrounding area, where both English and Welsh were spoken. Life Roberts was the son of Henry Roberts, who is described in the records of the University of Oxford relating to Robert Roberts as being a \\"gentleman\\" and as being from Llandysilio, near Llangollen in Denbighshire, Wales. Robert Roberts was educated at Jesus College, Oxford. He matriculated at the University of Oxford in March 1699, when he was recorded as being eighteen years old, and he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1702. Roberts was then ordained as a priest in the Church of England and, in 1709, was appointed as vicar of the parish of Chirk, Denbighshire. He remained there until his death in 1741, his tombstone recording that he was then 61 years old. Roberts wrote a booklet, in both English and Welsh, entitled A duo-glott-exposition of the Creed, the ten Commandments and the Lords Prayer, calculated for the borders of England and Wales, but particularly for the use of the parish of Chirk, whose inhabitants are partly Welsh and partly English - the Welsh title was Sacrament Catechism, neu Gatechism i barattoi rhai i dderbyn Sacrament Swpper yr Arglwydd.

The festival's founding chair is the novelist and political commentator Ahdaf Soueif. PalFest 2012 Poster: Gaza In an effort to overcome restrictions on Palestinians' freedom of movement the festival travels to its audiences, putting on free events in Arabic and English in the cities it travels to. The festival traditionally performs in Jerusalem, Ramallah, Haifa and Nablus. Because travel to Gaza is so restricted far fewer events take place there. In 2012 the festival happened exclusively in Gaza, as it was able to pressure access through Rafah, Egypt. Mahmoud Darwish sent a message to the inaugural festival in which he wrote: ‚ÄúThank you dear friends for your noble solidarity, thank you for your courageous gesture to break the moral siege inflicted upon us and thank you because you are resisting the invitation to dance on our graves. We are here. We are still alive.‚Äù Visiting author China Mi√©ville said the festival is \\"not only the most powerful and important literary festival it's ever been my privilege to attend, it's one of the most powerful and important things I've experienced, full stop\\". After ten editions the organisers announced they were taking a year break to assess the role of the festival in a rapidly changing world. In 2019 the festival was re-launched with \\"a sharpened focus on how to foster new writing that clarifies and frames the connections between the colonization of Palestine and the accelerating systems of control and dispossession around the world.\\"  Patrons and participants  Patrons of the festival have included Chinua Achebe, John Berger, Mahmoud Darwish, Seamus Heaney, Harold Pinter, Philip Pullman and Emma Thompson. Pullman said of the festival: \\"Every literary act, whether it is a great epic poem or an honest piece of journalism or a simple nonsense tale for children is a blow against the forces of stupidity and ignorance and darkness ‚Ä¶ The Palestine Festival of Literature exists to do just that ‚Äì and I salute it for its work.

Route description SR-193 begins at the intersection of 3000 West and Bernard F. Fisher Highway in Syracuse and heads east on the latter as a four-lane highway divided by a center turn lane. After crossing SR-108 (2000 West), the route turns southeast, passing north of the Freeport Center, then returns east, crossing over the Union Pacific Railroad tracks. SR-193 descends into Clearfield as a four-lane undivided highway through suburban Clearfield, crossing SR-126 at Main Street. After a couple of intersections with local roads and passing to the north of a park, the road intersects with I-15 at exit 334, a diamond interchange. Past this interchange, Hill Air Force Base appears on the northern side of the road and the highway enters Layton. Soon, the route intersects with the northern terminus of SR-232 at Hill Field Road, which also provides access to the south gate of the air force base. Past the southeastern fringe of the base, the road turns to the southeast before intersecting with Church Street, where SR-193 turns northeast again. The highway approaches the eastern edge of Layton and terminates at a diamond interchange with US-89 at exit 404. History The state legislature created SR-193 in 1935, running northeast from SR-1 (now SR-126) in Layton to SR-49 (now US-89). Despite the original definition, the road was built with federal aid in 1940 and 1941 past Hill Air Force Base, with a western terminus at SR-1 in Clearfield; a separate route - SR-232 - was similarly built in 1940 and numbered in 1941, running north from Layton to SR-193 at Hill Field.Utah Department of Transportation, State Route History , accessed July 2007 The definition of SR-193 was corrected to reflect its new route in 1945. In 2015, the route was extended west from SR-126 to 2000 West in Syracuse (SR-108). Another extension two years later brought the western terminus to 3000 West.

Featured in the 2007 book 100 Must-Read Crime Novels. It was filmed by Tony Richardson in 1974. The title is a shortened form of \\"It's a dead certainty,\\" in this case a play on words referring to the fact that the steeplechase horse Admiral should have won, but his jockey died. Synopsis Admiral should have won his race at Maidenhead, but an unexpected fall and the death of top jockey Bill Davidson gave jockey Alan York and his mount the win instead. But Alan recognized sabotage when he saw it and was not about to let a murderous act go unpunished, even if it meant risking his own life to bring his friend's killers to justice. Critical reception The Guardian's obituary of Francis read, \\"Right from the start, with Dead Cert in 1962, the Dick Francis thriller showed a mastery of lean, witty genre prose reminiscent -- sometimes to the point of comic parody -- of Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett. It was an American style that many clever people in England had attempted to reproduce without much success, and it was a wonder how a barely educated former jump jockey was able to do the trick with such effortless ease.\\" The New York Times added, > A chance encounter with a literary agent led to his writing The Sport of > Queens, published the year after he retired.

Fred Glueckstein, in Of Men, Women and Horses, wrote, \\"During the course of York's adventures, one can identify in Francis's work the elements that would precede his future success: a lone hero fighting villains with honor, courage, and determination; skilled plotting; action and suspense, and classic scenes of equestrian fiction.\\" Dead Cert is included in the \\"fiction core list\\" in Carol Alabaster's book Developing an Outstanding Core Collection: A Guide for Libraries by Carol Alabaster (2002).

In the series, Lambo is an infant assassin who goes to Japan to kill the hitman Reborn. Upon his failure, he starts to live with Reborn's pupil, the future boss from the Vongola Mafia family Tsuna Sawada. As the series progresses, Lambo becomes one of Tsuna's six Vongola guardians, The Guardian of Lightning, and has to confront various enemies from the Vongola despite his young age. When Lambo shoots himself with the from Bovino family, he transforms into his future self from 10 years later nicknamed . His character has also been featured in CDs soundtracks and video games based on the Reborn! series. Lambo's character has been well received by readers from the Reborn!, having been featured several times in the popularity poll from the series. Publications for manga, anime, and other media have commented on Lambo adding praise to and criticism to his appearances in the series. Various reviewers have liked Lambo's design, while others found his actions in the series to be entertaining. Character outline Personality Lambo is a 5-year-old Italian assassin affiliated with the Bovino Family. He comes to Japan to kill Reborn, so he can prove that he is worthy of becoming his own family's boss. He first appears on Tsunayoshi Sawada's window and tries to kill Reborn. However, he is a complete crybaby, and is no match for Reborn. Lambo's name was based on an Italian carmaker Lamborghini. His future dream is to rule the world. While being taken care of by Tsuna, Lambo becomes very appreciative of his mother, Nana. Lambo dresses in a cow suit complete with a tail, and has a huge afro with horns on the sides of his head which gives him the appearance of a bison. He possesses the Ten-Year Bazooka, which switches the target with their own self from ten years later for five minutes. Every time Lambo loses his cool, he usually says \\"Gotta... Stay... Calm...\\", then he uses it on himself, switching with his 15-year-old self. In this form, he switches his cow suit for a casual suit and cow-print shirt. Although Adult Lambo is shown to be handsome, he remains a crybaby, and is often heard saying things that imply his future involves cleaning toilets. He also begins many sentences with \\"Yare yare\\" (loosely translated as \\"Oh my!\\"; \\"Oh gosh!\\" or \\"My oh my\\" in Viz's translation), and often has one eye closed. Due to the unstable nature of the past affecting the future, Adult Lambo will only know of certain events after the adjustment in the past. At one point, he does not know of the Vongola Rings, but does during the tournament. When Adult Lambo uses the Ten-Year Bazooka, he transforms into his 25-year-old self. This version of Lambo is seen as having much more discipline, strength and intelligence than of his past selves, even being capable of almost easily defeating Leviathan during the tournament in the 5-minute effects of the Ten- Year Bazooka. Abilities The 5 year old Lambo is typically seen toting weapons like grenades and bazookas. In his 5 year old form his only notable ability is his which allows electricity to harmlessly pass through his body. In the future although still in his younger form Lambo is capable of activating the Vongola box which takes the form of a bull that Lambo can ride on. His weapon is Lampo's Shield, body armor that can give out a huge electrical burst called Corna Fulmine. In the Simon arc, his ring is rebuilt into the Vongola Helmet which, in its Cambio Forma, becomes full body armor with powerful horns. In his 15-year-old form he still possesses Electric Skin. However he has another ability called Thunder Set in which he summons lightning and charges it through his body. Thunder Set is followed by another technique called which charges lighting through Lambo's horns and causes severe shock to whoever the attack connects with. However it rarely works as it is short range and easy to dodge. The 25-year-old Lambo invents the Perfect Electric Skin in which no form of electricity can do him harm. He also created the Electrico Reverse which allows him to take electricity passing through him and gathers into his hand. His final ability is an enhanced version of Electrico Cornata in which he can use the electricity in his horns and give it the shape of a blade which makes up for some of its short range. Appearances In Reborn! Lambo is introduced as an annoying crybaby assassin after Reborn. Soon after he starts living with him and Tsuna Sawada. His future self appears several times during the series, and protects Haru along with I-pin when Haru is used as hostage by the Kokuyo Gang who were fighting Tsuna and his friend. When the Varia want their boss, Xanxus, become the Vongola's tenth boss, Lambo is chosen to be Tsuna's Vongola lightning guardian by Iemitsu Sawada. As part of the fights between the Varia and the Vongola, Lambo faces up against Leviathan. Lambo soon finds the match too much for him, so he jumps into the Ten-Year Bazooka and then again in adult form, revealing the 10-year-old Lambo. Leviathan easily beats him, too, so he jumps into the ten year bazooka to reveal 25-year-old Lambo. The 25-year-old Lambo nearly beats Leviathan but is switched with the 5-year-old Lambo as his 5 minutes was up. Before being killed by Leviathan, the match is interrupted by Tsuna who loses his and Lambo's ring. Despite ending seriously injured, Lambo is forced to participate in the last fight between the Vongola and the Varia, in which he is protected by the Vongola guardian Hayato Gokudera. After the Vongola's victory, Lambo recovers from his wounds. A short time later Lambo is transported to the future during the time the Millefiore Family is annihilating the Vongola. After Tsuna and his friends attack the Millefiore's Melone Base, Lambo infiltrate the Melone Base as back up along with Chrome Dokuro, I-Pin, and Tetsuya Kusakabe. After leaving the Melone Base, Lambo is trained by Gokudera in the use of rings and boxes to prepare for the fight against the Millefiore's guardians. After returning to the present, Lambo joins Tsuna, Gokudera and Ryohei in facing the Shimon Family who had destroyed the Vongola Rings (which are remodelled by Talbot into the Vongola Gear) and kidnapped Chrome. When he goes up against Shimon Guardian Rauji Oyama, Lambo's desire to have Rauji play with him provides the flame energy needed to create his Vongola Gear, the Vongola Helmet Ver. X. When Rauji starts attacking, Lambo swaps with his future self and uses the Vongola Gear to fight against him.Target 310 And thus defeated him with a new attack \\"ironhorn electrico\\". In other media Adult Lambo appeared in Katekyo Hitman Reborn! Battle Arena for the PlayStation Portable and in Katekyo Hitman Reborn! Dream Hyper Battle!. Although the later game was released for both the Wii and the PlayStation 2, Adult Lambo only appeared in the Wii version. On December 5, 2007 Pony Canyon released a Character CD featuring both Lambo and I-pin. It features various tracks and dialogue composed by both of their voice actors from their child selves: Junko Takeuchi and Li Mei Chan. On February 4, 2009 another CD named \\"Cosplay Party\\" was released. It featured Lambo, I-pin and Reborn featuring their voice actors. (with Reborn's one being Ken Narita). Reception In the popularity polls from the series, Lambo has continuously ranked within the top ten. In the first poll Lambo ranked 5th with 1563 votes. In the second poll, which was divided between heroes and villains, Lambo once again ranked 5th in the heroes poll. In the third poll, Lambo ranked the 7th most popular male character. However, he was not featured in the top ten from the fourth poll. Lambo has also been featured in pieces of merchandising based on the series such as cups, apparels, and plush. Lambo's introduction and development in Reborn! have been commented by several publications for manga, anime and other media. While reviewing the first volume from the series, Jarre Pine from Mania Entertainment found Lambo's child appearance to be very appealing for female readers as well as a good way to make various forms of merchandising. He also found his name to be very hilarious and noted that since he came from a \\"small line\\" of the Bovino Family, he thought that there would be a large number of assassins with Lambo's appearance. However, Erin Finnegan found Lambo's introduction in the series as well as his attitude with Reborn and Tsuna Sawada to be one of the several issues from the series he found while reading the first volume. However, in a later review, Finnegan found Lambo's actions in the series to be very funny, despite the fact some of the situations his character had were shown with other characters in other manga series. IGN's writer A.E. Sparrow found Lambo to be one of his favorite characters from Reborn! while commenting on volume 7 which was focused on him.

He currently resides in midtown Manhattan, New York. Biography Lee Evans was born and raised in the Sound View section of Bronx New York. Starting as a child, through the ages of 14‚Äì17 years old, Lee Evans put together some of his talented friends from \\"Monroe Projects\\" in the Bronx. He formed, wrote, arranged, played piano and sang in the young harmony group ‚ÄúThe Fourth Edition‚Äù a group that went on to win amateur night at the legendary Apollo Theater six times, sharing the stage with artists that shaped pop music as we know it today such as, Stephanie Mills, Michael Jackson and The Jackson 5, The Dells, The Delfonics and James Brown. After graduating from Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art then on Convent Avenue in Harlem NYC and attending Oberlin Conservatory of Music, Bronx Community College & City College, he started performing as a band member and/or musical director for acts such as The Jimmy Castor Bunch, Brass Construction, Kleer, New Edition, Johnny Gill, salsa artist Willie Col√≥n and as a musical director for The Force M.D.s, Afrika Bambaataa, and a host of others. On the recording side, he worked with such notable producers as Dan Hartman (70's disco hit instant replay), songwriter Paul Vance (Itsy Bitsy Teeny Weenie Yellow Polka Dot Bikini), DJ Freddy Bastone, JOSE \\"DJ ANIMAL\\" Diaz, Music Producer Randy Muller (of Skyy, Brass Construction, and Full Circle), and music manager Donny Linton. As a songwriter/producer and recording engineer, Lee Evans many accomplishments include his work with singer Marc Anthony (at the young age of 14), Cyndi Lauper, Harry Belafonte, The Force M.D.s, Brass Construction, Rainy Davis, Glen Jones, Afrikaa Bambaataa and a list of dance, hip hop and freestyle favorites from the 1980s and early 1990s, including artists Cyre, and The Cover Girls. In the early 80s, Mr. Evans became a touring musician. After over a decade on the road playing in the major arenas and clubs of virtually every major city nationwide, Mr. Evans embarked on several world tours, earning international recognition for his musical abilities. A few years later, Mr. Evans saw the need to establish himself locally and decided against going on any more lengthy tours. He stood by his word turning down an opportunity to tour internationally as the opening act for Madonna's La Isla Bonita world tour. Mr Evans still tours with Funk Band Brass Construction On the local scene, he did a stint as the house band keyboard player at a popular nightclub in Manhattan called 'The Cellar'. Here he backed up such notable artists as Johnny Kemp, Meli'sa Morgan, and Keith Sweat along with saxophonist Vincent Henry, Drummer Ralph Rolle, keyboardist John Adams, and other musical sidemen. In 1980, Evans started JAMBOX Recording Studios in his basement apartment in The Bronx, which in 1992 he incorporated and expanded (along with co-owner Cathy Palmisano) into JAMBOX Entertainment, a full-service recording facility in Manhattan. In 1999, Evans started the AET Audio Engineering Program, with the intentions of teaching his audio engineering techniques to new and upcoming music artists and producers. In 2004, Evans introduced his latest brainchild \\"The Gift Of Song\\". A service that reached out to non-professionals and gave them a shot in the 'studio'. In 2006, Lee Evans (CEO) along with Cathy Palmisano (Administrative Director) and accomplished music producer/composer Dante Lattanzi of Caelum Music Production formed 4Sight Music Productions, a company that went on to produce the Naked Cowboy's debut album \\"The Year of the Cowboy\\". Lee Evans is also a co-founder and the music director of Reach Out Inc. a non-profit organization that educates and promotes awareness about the perils of illegal drugs, alcohol abuse, tobacco, crime, violence, prejudice, and life-threatening diseases such as AIDS. Reach Out Inc.'s presentations are characterized by the use of interactive, high- energy presentations that intertwine music, dance, and motivational speaking. In January 2009, Reach Out's president Lori Michaels and Music Director Lee Evans received notability as \\"Person Of The Week\\" on NY1 News.

The site was notified in 1986 under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. It is on the south-eastern edge of Monkspath. The site has recently been targeted for development for houses but these plans have been met with uproar from locals in Monkspath and nearby villages, such as Cheswick Green and Hockley Heath, as it would destroy such a special natural site. The site has probably been used as a hay meadow for over 800 years, and has not been ploughed for at least 200 years. It was originally at risk of development from the construction of a new local supermarket and garden centre in 1986. A little over half of the site was saved from development by a campaign led by Members of Warwickshire Nature Conservation Trust when proposals for the new supermarket were outlined. The remaining of meadow was relocated in deep turves to a new site at Temple Balsall. Today Notcutts Garden Centre manages the site under the direction of English Nature. The meadow supports a diverse level of flora with over 150 recorded species, including various grass species such as common bent (Agrostis capillaris), red fescue (Festuca rubra), Yorkshire fog (Holcus lanatus) and tufted hair-grass (Deschampsia cespitosa). Herbs include cowslip (Primula veris), betony (Stachys officinalis), great burnet (Sanguisorba officinalis), dyer's greenweed (Genista tinctoria), meadow thistle (Cirsium dissectum), saw-wort (Serratula tinctoria), heath grass (Danthonia decumbens), heath spotted orchid (Dactylorhiza maculata), and common spotted orchid (Dactylorhiza maculata). Fauna includes for small heath (Coenonympha pamphilus), meadow brown (Maniola jurtina) and common blue (Polyommatus icarus) butterflies.

Ink traps are only needed for small point sizes and are usually only found on typefaces designed for printing on newsprint. Fonts of this kind are applicable for classifieds or telephone books. Typefaces with ink traps may be offered in versions without them for display on screen or at larger sizes. Typefaces featuring ink traps include Retina, Bell Centennial, and Tang.

Parts of the building, including its ornate west doorway, date from the late 11th century and are contemporary with the nearby Norman castle. The church is a Grade I listed building as of 6 December 1950. Foundation and history of the priory It was founded around 1072 as a Benedictine priory by William FitzOsbern and his son Roger de Breteuil, 2nd Earl of Hereford. FitzOsbern had been granted the Lordship of Striguil by his second cousin King William in gratitude for his support in the Norman conquest of England, and was responsible for starting the building of a new castle overlooking the River Wye on the border with the kingdoms of Wales. At the same time he established a nearby monastic cell, so as to collect rent from the lands within Gwent which he had granted to his home Priory of Cormeilles in Normandy. By the early 12th century, the monastic establishment, on a ridge overlooking the river about 300 metres from the castle, had the status of an alien priory in its own right, though it probably never held more than about 12 monks.Rick Turner and Andy Johnson (eds.), Chepstow Castle ‚Äì its history and buildings, 2006, John Newman, The Buildings of Wales: Gwent/Monmouthshire, 2000, It superseded an earlier Augustinian priory located about 2 km away, which was dedicated to the Welsh saint Cynfarch (or St. Kingsmark), a disciple of St. Dyfrig.Miranda Aldhouse-Green and Ray Howell (eds.), Gwent In Prehistory and Early History: The Gwent County History Vol.1, 2004, As Chepstow developed as a market town and port around the castle and priory during the mediaeval period, the nave became used as the parish church. Accommodation was built on the south side of the church, in the 13th century, and the first vicar appointed by authority of the king, John de Hemmyngburg, is recorded in 1348. The priory had extensive grounds, probably including most of the land south of the church enclosed by Chepstow's 13th-century town wall or Port Wall. During the Hundred Years' War between England and France in the 14th century, the priory became detached from its association with Cormeilles, and instead became attached at different times both to Llantarnam Abbey near Caerleon and, from 1414, to Bermondsey Abbey in Southwark.R. Shoesmith, Excavations at Chepstow 1973‚Äì1974, Cambrian Archaeological Association, 1991, , pp.3‚Äì12 The priory was eventually suppressed during the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1536 during the English Reformation, at which time there were still three monks in residence. Most of the priory buildings, including the choir part of the church, the cloister, chapter house, lodgings and kitchens, were demolished at that time, and the foundations are buried beneath a car park beside the current church. Remains of a large barn and well were also found during excavations in the 1970s.Chepstow Society, Chepstow Town Trail, 1990 The present building View of St. Mary's Church Part of the Norman church remains, but it has been greatly modified over later centuries. The original Priory Church was built in local yellow Triassic sandstone, with a long vaulted nave, massive piers, and a notably ornamented west entrance doorway with zigzag and lozenge patterns, dating from the early 12th century. These parts remain. However, later extensions and modifications have used other varieties of stone in other architectural styles, with the result that the whole church has been described as \\"an extraordinarily disjointed building.\\" The main central tower of the original church collapsed in a storm in 1701, destroying the transepts. A new wall was then built at the eastern end of the nave, and its western end built up to form a new tower, designed \\"in an amusingly rustic classical idiom\\". This was completed in 1706 under the ministry of Thomas Chest, who was vicar from 1701 to 1740. In 1841, through the influence of Edward Copleston, Bishop of Llandaff, who lived locally, the aisles were removed, and the eastern end, crossing and transepts were rebuilt.Ivor Waters, The Town of Chepstow, 1972 Further work partly to restore the Norman character of the nave was begun in 1890, but was abandoned unfinished in 1913. The church contains two fonts, one of Norman origin and the other from the 15th century. There are several notable tombs and memorials, including that of Henry Somerset, 2nd Earl of Worcester, and the Jacobean tomb of local benefactor Margaret Cleyton with her two husbands and 12 children. It also contains the tomb of Henry Marten, signatory to King Charles I's death warrant, who was imprisoned in Chepstow Castle until his death in 1680. His memorial includes an acrostic epitaph. The organ, one of the few in the country with pipework dating from the early 17th century,J. R. Guy and E. R. Smith, Ancient Gwent Churches, 1979, was originally made for Gloucester Cathedral (possibly by the Dallam family). It was moved to Bristol Cathedral in 1663 and then to Chepstow possibly as early as 1685, and certainly by the 18th century.1898 specification of the organ, 1943 specification of the organ, 1996 specification of the organ, 1999 specification of the organ, National Pipe Organ Register, the British Insititue of Organ Studies, 2008.

Origins  Both the neighbourhood and the avenue are named after James Monk, who was the attorney general of Lower Canada, and chief justice to the court of the Queen's Bench from 1804 to 1824. This area in particular became associated with Monk due to the estate he built in 1804 known as Monklands. This estate would later become the Governor General's residence, and was later sold to the Congregation de Notre-Dame who would use the building for the Villa Maria private Catholic girls school.  Monkland Avenue  Monkland Avenue has been a commercial street since the 1930s and has gone through various highs and lows.

The Director of Bands, George Sparks, pulled together 85 students who wearing a Caribbean style shirt and straw brimmed hats performed at home football games at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami for the 2002 and 2003 seasons. In 2003, Mr. Sparks took an administrative position and without a permanent leader the band went inactive in Fall 2004. In April 2005, Christopher Chapman was hired as the university's first Director of Athletic Bands, overseeing the 'Parliament Sound' Pep Band which performs at basketball games, and the Marching Owls.

Its population was 64 as of the 2010 census. Geography Indian Springs lies along U.S. Route 40 and Maryland Route 56 between Clear Spring and Hancock; it is located north of Fort Frederick State Park. The community is approximately west of Hagerstown and is officially designated a part of the Hagerstown Metropolitan Area (Hagerstown-Martinsburg, Maryland-West Virginia Metropolitan Statistical Area). The area is traditionally defined as encompassing the narrow tract of land north of U.S. Route 40 between Fairview Mountain and the Licking Creek. Terrain in the area is generally rugged with elevations between 600 and above sea level, the landscape being primarily wooded. The terrain here differs greatly from the neighboring Hagerstown Valley, where elevations average less than 650' and is characterized by fertile, gently rolling hills. While land for farming is not as readily available in the Springs area, orchards have been a source of local livelihood for centuries. The Indian Springs watershed is serviced by four primary runs: Lanes, Rabble, Rattle, and Indian Springs. These runs are tributaries of nearby Licking Creek. The Indian Springs for which the area was named have their headwaters on the west flank of Fairview Mountain.United States Geological Survey - Cherry Run Topographic Map; 1998 Two solutional caves are also reported to exist in this area. Revell's and Darby Caves are both said to be developed in the Tonoloway Formation, a thin-bedded dolomitic limestone of the upper Silurian.Caves of Maryland, Franz/Slifer, 1971 Much of the land not held by private individuals is part of the Indian Springs State Wildlife Preserve and is open to the public. A local sportsman's club also owns land adjoining the preserve. Several companies and institutions maintain equipment located atop the larger hills, including Johns Hopkins University, Verizon, and local radio stations; trespassing is strictly prohibited. Tourism Indian Springs is located near the state-run Indian Springs Wildlife Management Area, a tract of forestry that draws tourists for fishing, hiking, and hunting. Fishing is popular at Blair's Valley Lake and hunting deer is famous in the wooded areas. Fairview Mountain, located in the WMA, once served as a Civil War military signal post.

Each monolight has its own independent power source.Intro To Flashes: Monolights And Hot Shoe Flashes - Tutorials It does not depend on a centralized power supply as a \\"pack and head\\" system does. Monolights are also independently controlled: each has its own power settings and light output. Flash power is predominantly measured by the industry in watt seconds, which is unit-equivalent to the joule.  Construction  A simple monolight at a minimum consists of a power supply, power connector, and flash tube. Most monolights have a fairly common set of features, described below. Common features Most monolights have several features in common:Guided Tour of a Monolight * Flashtube/strobe bulb -- The bulb that creates the flash. * Modeling light -- A constant light that illuminates the subject and aids the photographer in composing the picture. * Power connector -- The receptacle for the power cord. * Power switch -- A switch to turn the monolight on and off. * Slave sensor -- A sensor that detects the flashes of other strobes and triggers the strobe of which it is a part. * Reflector -- A device which modifies the light, allowing it to bounce off of a shiny surface. * Stand socket -- A device on the bottom of the unit that allows it to be mounted on a standard light stand. * Umbrella socket -- A receptacle into which is inserted a light-modifying umbrella. Additional features In addition to those features listed above, monolights may also have the following features: * Output control - Allows the intensity of the flash to be adjusted down or up to the maximum power output of the flash unit. * Model light tracking - Allows the modeling light to increase and decrease with the strobe when the strobe fires. * Auto dumping ‚Äì the ability to partially discharge the light‚Äôs capacitors when the output power is reduced. Without this feature, when the light's output is turned down, it has to be fired to fully discharge the capacitors, then the capacitors recharged up to the new lower level. * Power recycle indicator - A light or sound emitter or both which tell the photographer that the flash has fired, and is currently charging. * Remote control - either wired (through a telephone jack to a handheld control) or wireless. Remotes may allow the user to adjust light output, modelling lamp intensity, etc. Considerations of a good monolight Monolights are photographic flashes and therefore carry some of the same considerations as a standard flash unit. A primary concern is guide number. Each monolight has a guide number specifying its range at certain film speeds. A common misconception is that the watt-second measurement is an indication of light output. It is not; it is a measure of electrical energy.Hi-Tech Studio: Monolights  Digital Photo Pro Magazine While the electrical energy used in firing the flash is usually the most significant factor, light output is also affected by the efficiency of the flash tube and the capacitor. In addition to power output, monolights have other, special considerations as they are meant to be used for large-scale, studio work. Portability, consistency, feature set, parts availability and cost are prime considerations in monolights.  Portability  Monolights are larger than most on-camera strobes. As such certain portability issues must be considered: =Size and weight= Monolights are sometimes referred to as monoblocks Studio Lighting and Strobes due to the containment of all power and controls in each individual flash unit. Consequently, monolights usually weigh more than on-camera flashes. As monolights need to be placed on light stands, the size and weight of each light stand must also be considered. This size and weight must also be weighed against a pack and head system, which typically have a much weightier generator box. =Power requirements= Monolights are independently powered and therefore require individual power connections. Monolights become less practical in situations where power outlets are scarce.  Consistency  Monolight consistency refers to the power output of the unit from flash to flash. Good monolights will vary little from one flash to another.Studio Lighting Considerations Monolights that vary greatly (more than 1/5 of an f-stop) are said to be inconsistent. Inconsistent monolights makes computing the appropriate aperture next to impossible due to the variable light output. Since monolights often vary the capacitor charge to vary the light output, lower voltage through the tube can affect the flash's color temperature. Some units have electronics to compensate and maintain a steady color temperature through the power range.  Features  A monolight's features make it more versatile, but it also makes a monolight more expensive. A good monolight generally has all the features listed above in the Common Features section.  Availability of accessories and parts  Procuring replacement parts and accessories for monolights is also a consideration. Monolights made by mainstream companies generally have a higher parts availability in more places than off-brand products. This is a strong consideration when using monolights on a location shoot. Accessories tend to be more readily available for on- brand monolights.

It is located north of Charters Towers. It was built from 1942 to 1943 by Allied Works Council and Queensland Main Roads Commission. The airfield was constructed for the USAAF 38th Bomb Group in August 1942 as a satellite field for Charters Towers Airport, and later used by the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) during World War II as a maintenance base. Consisting of two runways, the airfield was abandoned after 1948. Today, the remains of the airfield consist of some deteriorating runways, taxiways and hardstands, mostly being reclaimed by grassland and shrub. No buildings have survived. It is also known as Breddan Airfield and Breddan WWII Aircraft Maintenance, Repair and Salvage Depot. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 16 April 2010.  History  Breddan airfield, located about north of Charters Towers, was initially constructed as a dispersal field for Charters Towers airfield during April 1942. In August 1942 Breddan was occupied by two squadrons of the US 38th Bombardment Group. On the departure of the US squadrons Breddan was chosen for development as a major aircraft repair and salvage depot under RAAF control. The construction program which took place during 1943 involved the erection of maintenance hangars, engineering workshops, torpedo stores, personnel camps, a power station and medical facilities. The base was abandoned after 1947. As early as July 1941 the RAAF had ordered a survey of the Charters Towers district to identify sites for airfields to accommodate heavy bombers and combat aircraft. An initial survey was undertaken during September resulting in the identification of suitable airfield sites at Corinda (Charters Towers), Sandy Creek (Breddan) and several locations near Sellheim. On 7 December 1941 the Japanese made a surprise attack on the US naval base at Pearl Harbor in the Hawaiian Islands. At the same time Japanese forces launched assaults on Thailand, the Philippines and the British colony of Malaya. Three days after Pearl Harbor, two capital ships of the Royal Navy were sunk off the coast of Malaya. This gave the Japanese almost total control of the seas to Australia's north. The sudden fall of Singapore on 15 February 1942 and the rapid, unchecked Japanese advance through the islands of the Netherlands East Indies raised fears of the invasion of Australia and attacks on Queensland bases. Charters Towers was the closest inland centre that could provide strategic support and aircraft dispersal facilities for the main North Eastern Area air base at Garbutt, Townsville, which was considered vulnerable to Japanese attack. The RAAF ordered commencement of preliminary work on an aerodrome at Charters Towers during January 1942. By early February Charters Towers airfield had been accorded high priority and Main Roads Commission engineers were engaged to supervise the clearing and construction of two gravel runways. The work was completed during March in readiness for the arrival of the United States Army Air Force 3rd Bombardment Group (Light). Arrival of the US 3 BG(L) at Charters Towers saw the need for dispersal strips in the vicinity and the revival of the earlier investigation of the Sandy Creek airfield site north of the town. A second dispersal strip was planned at Southern Cross, a gold mining area to the west of the town. Under MRC supervision, clearing and construction of an airfield at the Sandy Creek location on the northern inland road connecting Charters Towers with the Atherton Tableland, began on 10 April 1942. The new airfield was named Breddan, presumably after Breddan Pastoral Holding belonging to Archibald Truscott and John Henry Bryant of Five Mile Creek. Completion of a gravel east‚Äìwest runway was the priority, with clearing of a second north‚Äìsouth runway to follow. Dauntless dive bombers of 3 BG(L) arrived at Charters Towers in late March 1942 and some aircraft may have been dispersed to Breddan during April. On 26 May, after discussions with the RAAF North Eastern Area Command, the USAAF decided that a heavy bombardment role proposed for Charters Towers airfield, would be transferred to Breddan, with torpedo workshops established between Charters Towers and Breddan. It was initially planned that when the US bombardment squadrons vacated Charters Towers, the airfield facilities would be occupied by a RAAF aircraft repair and salvage unit. With the US victory at Midway Island in early June, much of the proposed airfield construction program west of Charters Towers was abandoned. For Breddan the plan became one of completing both runways to gravelled stage and the erection of workshops and camp facilities. By June a major construction program had commenced at Breddan with the erection of approximately 40 buildings which by July were noted to be urgently in need of camouflage painting. The buildings included an aircraft repair section workshop, a motor transport workshop near the southern entrance and camp facilities (No.1 Camp). The Allied Works Council (AWC) was responsible for contracting the building program. By late July Breddan was occupied by the RAAF No.12 Repair and Salvage Unit and ground crew of the USAAF 38th Bombardment Group (Medium). 8th Bombardment Squadron - B-25Cs, 1942 On 22 August the 71st and 405th squadrons of the US 38 BG(M) arrived at Breddan after leaving Hawaii on 25 July and flying their B-25 Mitchell bombers across the Pacific Ocean. Their aircraft were combat ready on arrival and reunification with the ground crews who had reached Australia by sea. The main east-west Runway 60 was bitumen sealed by 22 August when most of the B-25 bombers arrived. The north- south second runway running parallel with a straight section of the northern inland road, was not completed. The AWC contracted the construction of a USAAF camp at Breddan which was in the course of erection by 22 September when the US Base Section ordered that no further work be done on the camp. The Base Section also ordered that the main runway facilities be completed, but that all work on the second runway should be abandoned. The second runway later served as an aircraft taxiway for the northern repair and maintenance workshops. 8th Bombardment Squadron - A-24, 1942 By early October the 71st and 405th squadrons of the US 38 BG(M) had been posted to Townsville and Breddan was chosen for development as a major aircraft repair and salvage depot under RAAF control, based around No.12 Repair and Salvage Unit and No.6 Aircraft Repair Depot, RAAF. For this reason winding dispersal taxiways were considered unnecessary. The facilities required would include engineering workshops. RAAF No.1 Torpedo Maintenance Unit was established at Breddan on 18 November 1942 and an order was placed with the AWC for construction of facilities for the unit including reinforced concrete igloo shelters for the storage of torpedoes and torpedo war heads. Ten reinforced concrete storage buildings for No.1 TMU were completed by June 1943 when provision was made for their camouflage. RAAF No.6 ARD departed from Breddan during December 1942 and arrival of an advance party of No.13 ARD marked the beginning of a significant building program. RAAF No.13 ARD found a number of important building works were outstanding on their arrival at Breddan and the advance party were given the role of erecting their own workshops and stores as their first major task at the base. On 20 January 1943 the AWC was asked to proceed with construction of 11 buildings as part of the Breddan ARD Scheme. Buildings ordered comprised: salvage hangar, propeller testing building, armament hut, electroplating shop, battery hut, motor transport store and office, and four headquarters buildings. The workshops included a number of prefabricated steel frame Bellman hangars. Up to six Bellman hangars may have been erected at Breddan by the end of World War II. AWC minutes for 18 February 1943 include an approval to proceed with the fabrication of four \\"American Type Hangars\\" galvanised iron covered steel workshop buildings which had been reconstructed in Melbourne. These buildings were also erected by the advance personnel of No.13 ARD. Throughout this period units of No.12 RSU, RAAF, continued operating from Breddan. During 1943 the AWC were asked to organise an intensive program of building construction at Breddan which received a substantial allocation of funds to cover the works. The following works were ordered during the first half of the year: a hospital sick bay near the No.2 Camp, with a treatment room and medical officer's hut; a barracks store and officers' mess for No.1 TMU; motor transport engine repair and body chassis workshops; aircraft dismantling hangars; gun firing platform and test butts. Work on No.1 Camp to hold 350 personnel was completed during May by which period work was also nearing completion on No.2 Camp to hold 400 men. The building construction work was undertaken by Civil Construction Corps labour. During June orders were lodged by the Department of Air for construction of a post office, canteen, ethylene glycol reclamation hut, WAAAF camp, dental clinic, squadron air depot, cool room and duty pilot's tower. Orders were also placed for the sealing of taxiways and supply of an air conditioning unit for the instrument repair workshop. By October 1943 provision of hutted camp accommodation for WAAAF personnel had been accorded priority for construction. To avoid dependency on power supply from Charters Towers a reinforced concrete sub-station building was commenced about June to hold a 25 KVA diesel electric generating plant. The power station was scheduled for completion in September. Workshops and barracks were sufficiently established by August 1943 to allow the main contingent of No.13 ARD to make the move from Tocumwal (NSW) to Breddan. In December 1943 No.12 RSU departed from Breddan for Kiriwina in New Guinea. No.6 Central Recovery Depot, RAAF, was established at Breddan in June 1944. RAAF units based at Breddan airfield during World War II were No.12 RSU, No. 10 RSU, No.6 ARD, No.13 ARD, No.1 TMU and No.6 CRD. At its largest in late 1943 a total of 1200 personnel were accommodated on the base. The RAAF continued to operate from Breddan after World War II and the last unit, No.13 ARD, departed in November 1947. The base was closed by 1948. All workshop and camp facilities were later removed and the property turned over to pastoral use.

The place contains a number of component areas associated with its wartime operation.  Runways and Duty Pilot's Tower Base  The bitumen sealed east-west Runway 60 degrees extends east of the Gregory Developmental Road for about two kilometres in length. The unfinished north- south Runway 20 degrees, remains evident as a regrowth area and former wartime taxiway running parallel with the road. Other taxiways extend north and west from Runway 60 to workshop sites of the Airframe Repair Section, General Engineering Section and Engine Repair Section. The duty pilot's tower is located at the western end of Runway 60. The site comprises a concrete slab, possibly an office floor, with four concrete tower footings at each corner, each containing two steel members to which the base of the tower was attached with bolts.  Airframe Repair Section  The Airframe Repair Section, located to the west of the Gregory Developmental Road, contains the concrete floors of at least seven workshops and hangars including the base of a cantilever hangar. An earth butt for gun testing is located near the cantilever hangar. Other workshop surfaces were designed for Bellman hangars. Several concrete tie down blocks for aircraft remain.  General Engineering Section  The General Engineering Section, located between the east-west Runway 60 and the unfinished north‚Äìsouth runway, contains concrete floors of at least seven workshops and hangars. Three Bellman hangar floors are evident, including an instrument repair shop and a lathe workshop. An electroplating workshop can be identified by two concrete channels running the length of the floor surface. The GES also included an armature winding shop.  Engine Repair Section  The Engine Repair Section, located north of the GES, contains concrete floor surfaces for six workshops including a number of Bellman hangars. From south to north the six ERS workshop slabs are identified as: Receipt and Despatch Shop, Engine Inspection and Dismantling Shop, Stripping and Cleaning Shop, Blacksmith Shop with Retort Furnace, Final Assembly Shop, and Propeller Maintenance Shop. Two other ERS workshop floor surfaces, including an engine running shed with steel tie down bolts, are located on the west side of the Gregory Developmental Road.  Motor Transport Section  The site of the Motor Transport Repair and Engine Overhaul Section is located south of Runway 60, at the entrance to the airfield. At least three MT workshops are shown on a wartime plan of the base. The site of No.2 Camp is located nearby.  Torpedo Maintenance Unit  The Torpedo Maintenance Unit stores are located apart from the engineering workshops in the south east sector of the airfield complex. The TMU stores consist of ten reinforced concrete igloos of two types. Seven torpedo maintenance stores are spaced apart over about a kilometre forming a rough oval. These reinforced concrete buildings, in length by in width, are designed with two entrances at one end and a semi-circular formwork concrete roof reaching about in height. The roofs contain ventilation holes and steel bolts for securing camouflage nets. Three reinforced concrete torpedo warhead stores are spaced apart in gullies further to the south east of the maintenance igloos. The warhead stores are designed with a single entrance at the centre of the buildings with a reinforced concrete portico above. The stores are about in length, in width and in height. All are equipped with ventilation holes in the roofs, bolts for securing camouflage nets and contain evidence of wartime ochre and green camouflage paint.  Torpedo Maintenance Unit Camp  The Torpedo Maintenance Unit camp, located at the north east end of Runway 60, contains a small reinforced concrete igloo building which served as a generator shed. The camp area also includes the concrete floor and oven base of a mess and kitchen, and a small stone structure thought to have been a water heater or incinerator.  Power House and Hospital  A power house and hospital sick bay are located south of Runway 60 near the southern boundary of the airfield. The power house is constructed with high reinforced concrete walls. The internal concrete floor surface contains footings and channels for a diesel engine, alternator and cabling to a distribution board. A reinforced concrete switching room is attached at one end of the building which totals in length and in width. A reinforced concrete inground cooling tank is situated at the north west end of the building. The hospital foundations comprise concrete floor surfaces and concrete footings that may have supported a timber floor surface.  Reinforced Concrete Building and No.1 Camp  North of Runway 60 at its eastern end is a reinforced concrete building of seven rooms covered with a flat concrete roof. The building is in length by in width and includes a toilet. An eroded earth traverse wall once protected the entrance doorway. The purpose of the building is uncertain. It may have been constructed as a signals station or a medical aid post, and may have later been used for secure storage. The site of No.1 Camp covers an area of the airfield extending north from the east end of Runway 60. Archaeological evidence of an open air picture theatre includes concrete lined post holes for a projection box and a scatter of metal slide holders. Several large concrete floor surfaces of former stores buildings are located north of the runway, nearby.

Code Systems Corporation is an American corporation headquartered in Seattle, Washington, and is best known for its Turbo products that include Browser Sandbox, Turbo Studio, TurboServer, and Turbo. Kenji Obata founded Code Systems Corporation in 2006 and introduced Turbo‚Äôs precursor, Xenocode. Xenocode was an early application virtualization engine for the Windows platform. Obata serves as the CEO of the corporation, which had become commonly known as Spoon since a rebranding in 2010. Turbo‚Äôs tools package conventional software applications for Microsoft Windows in a portable application format that can be delivered via a single executable or streamed over the web. Files and settings automatically synchronize across devices via Turbo‚Äôs patented virtualization technology which allows access to local files and printers from web-based applications. About the company CEO Obata graduated from Yale University in 1999 with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Mathematics (summa cum laude). He spent several years as a development lead at Microsoft Corporation before attending the University of California, Berkeley to obtain his Ph.D. in Computer Science. After receiving his Ph.D., Obata returned to Seattle in 2006 to grow the company. From 2006 to 2009, the Code Systems Corporation developed Xenocode, one of the first application virtualization engines for the Windows platform. The product focused on application deployment via preconfigured executables. Spoon was launched in 2010 as a reintroduction of Xenocode‚Äôs virtualization engines. Turbo‚Äôs technology combines application and storage virtualization with web-based network and synchronization protocols, machine learning algorithms, and semistructured large data storage systems. Turbo.net virtual applications run in isolated sandboxes, allowing multiple application versions to run simultaneously without conflict. Turbo.net uses technologies such as Scala, Akka, Lift, and AWS to build its website and server systems. Turbo technology is used by educational, entertainment, financial, government, health care, and information technology organizations. Turbo‚Äôs customer base consists of tens of thousands of organizations and millions of end users. Products include solutions for enterprise software distribution; web development and testing tools such as Browser Sandbox, Browser Studio, and Turbo; and free accounts that allow users to stream hundreds of brand-name applications like Skype, Chrome, and Firefox without installing them. All accounts also come with cloud storage hosted on Turbo.net. Turbo is headquartered in Seattle, is profitable and employee-owned, and adds thousands of new users each week.  Turbo.net  Turbo.net, the official website of Turbo, hosts applications that can be launched via the web with no installation. Turbo‚Äôs application library includes popular software like Chrome, Skype, VLC Media Player, SketchUp, and hundreds of other top free and open-source applications. Turbo works through a small browser plugin with no administrative privileges or drivers required. In addition to functioning as a tool for individuals, Turbo is often used by professionals who work from multiple desktops, small businesses and teams requiring collaboration, and larger enterprises with distributed or remote workforces. The introduction of Turbo, which combines Selenium with Turbo browsers for unlimited automated browser testing, has increased Turbo‚Äôs utilization as a web development and testing tool. Turbo works by materializing a virtual environment on the endpoint device, transferring application components required for execution, capturing application interactions with the storage system into a sandbox, and synchronizing the sandbox contents back to the cloud. The Turbo Virtual Machine (SVM) is a lightweight implementation of core operating system APIs, including the filesystem, registry, process, and threading subsystems; it is completely implemented within the Windows user-mode space. Applications executing within the Turbo virtual environment interact with a virtualized filesystem, registry, and process environment, rather than directly with the host device operating system. The virtualization engine handles requests within the virtualized environment internally or, when appropriate, routes requests to the host device filesystem and registry, possibly redirecting or overriding requests as determined by the virtual application configuration. Cross- browser testing - Browser Sandbox Turbo.net hosts browsersandbox.com, which allows users to run multiple versions of browsers such as Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, and mobile browsers on a single machine. Web developers can use Browser Sandbox for cross-browser testing to ensure websites function correctly in multiple versions of popular browsers. Virtualized browsers behave exactly like installed browsers, and because they run locally, web applications tests can be hosted on the user‚Äôs own development machine or on internal servers. Turbo.net supports standard browser components like Java applets and ActiveX controls as well as popular browser plugins like Firebug, IE Developer Toolbar, and CSS and JavaScript debugging consoles. App Library Similar to their Browser Sandbox, Turbo hosts an extensive application library filled with hundreds of free and open- source applications that Turbo streams to end users. The app library is part of Turbo‚Äôs free basic account and lets anyone stream and use full desktop applications like Skype, Google Chrome, VLC media player, Sublime Text, Notepad++, and GIMP without installing them. Turbo virtual applications do not need to be accessed through a browser. Users with Turbo‚Äôs plugin can press [Alt+Win] to bring up the Spoon Console, which acts as an alternate Start menu that can launch both local and virtualized applications and files. Turbo claims that running these applications in virtual sandboxes is faster, safer, and more portable than installing them locally. Software Turbo Studio Turbo Studio (formerly Spoon Studio and Xenocode Virtual Application Studio) is an application virtualization tool that runs on Microsoft Windows. The tool packages software applications into portable applications; these single executable files can be run instantly on any Windows computer. Turbo Studio emulates the operating system features that are necessary for applications to run and therefore reduces resource overhead. Turbo Studio allows the user to convert existing applications into virtual applications. Deployment models include standalone EXE, MSI package, and HTTP-based delivery via the Turbo browser plugin. Turbo Studio packages all application files, settings, runtimes, and components into a single package that runs instantly with zero setup. The Turbo virtual machine (SVM) supports all versions of the .NET Framework and Java, thus allowing users to execute .NET, Java, and AIR- based applications with no separate installations. Turbo allows legacy software to run properly on new operating systems, thereby reducing the cost and risk associated with operating system rollouts. Turbo is the only virtualization engine in its class to support virtualization of both 32- and 64-bit applications; system services and databases such as SQL Server; and advanced software technologies such as DCOM and SxS. Fully user-mode implementation eliminates the need for device drivers, reboots, and administrative privileges. TurboServer TurboServer (formerly Spoon Server) is an application deployment platform that allows software packaged with Turbo Studio to be deployed, patched, and managed via the web. End users log into a website from any browser and are able to launch and use desktop- level applications like Microsoft Word and Photoshop without having to install them. It is a private version of the Turbo.net service. Applications are streamed to user desktops and run on clean desktops without administrative privileges. Desktops can be re-imaged and locked-down. TurboServer includes additional administrative features such as AD/LDAP integration, user and group application access control, usage logging, and analytics.  Turbo  Turbo (formerly Spoonium) is a platform of tools that allows users to package Windows desktop applications and their dependencies into software containers. Application containers made with Turbo can run on any Windows machine without installers, app breaks, or dependencies. Containers can be used to streamline the software development life cycle. Developers can ensure that their applications run as intended by including specific dependencies within containers. Software testers can rapidly pull and test software without having to install dependencies, can test multiple application versions side-by-side, and can return application containers to their development teams in specific app states. System administrators can reduce failures due to differences in development, testing, production, and end-user environments. Turbo‚Äôs service is currently in an open beta.

Biography Rolf Billberg was born in Lund, Sweden on 22 August 1930 and grew up living with his mother in Gothenburg. At age 17 Billberg began playing clarinet and playing with an Uddevalla military band for four years. He then made the switch to the tenor saxophone and worked with local bands in Visby, Bor√•s and Gothenburg, going to Stockholm in 1954 to join the Simon Brehm orchestra. From 1954‚Äî1955 Billberg also worked with Lars Gullin and made some recordings with him. In 1955 he worked in Copenhagen, Denmark with the Lasse Wanderyd orchestra and later for the Ib Glindemann orchestra in 1956. From 1956‚Äî1957, Billberg was performing in various American clubs located in Germany and France with vibraphonist Vera Auer. It was during this period that Billberg made the switch to alto saxophone. In 1957 he began working with the Carl-Henrik Norin orchestra in Stockholm. Over the coming years he would work frequently in Copenhagen with groups such as the Jazz Quintet 60 and the Danish Radio Jazz Orchestra. Back in Sweden he continued his work with Lars Gullin and also worked frequently with trumpet player Jan Allan. In 1966 he joined the Danish Radio Big Band (led by Ib Glindemann), spending the summer in Gothenburg helping to look after his mother's hotel there.

Characteristics  Calvary Bansk√° ≈†tiavnica is the most important Baroque calvary in Slovakia and in the whole former Kingdom of Hungary ‚Äì probably even in the whole of Europe. This calvary is a complex of 3 churches and 22 chapels with precious painting decorations, furnished by wooden and blacksmith movables and wooden painted reliefs. All buildings of churches and chapels are set into the western side of a solid lava column in the middle of an ancient volcano ‚Äì a hill named Scharffenberg (). The work was initiated by Jesuits in the 18th century as a part of their large programme implemented across the country.  Formation  Around 1740, medieval city Schemnitz, Kingdom of Hungary (now Bansk√° ≈†tiavnica, Slovakia) intended to form a standard Calvary with fourteen stations in the eastern part of the city ‚Äì under a hill named Ostr√Ω vrch (Scharffenberg ‚Äì this hill along with the surrounding land belonged to the family of Fritz von Friedenlieb, of Protestant religion). However, only two chapels still remain standing. The Jesuit Father Francis Perger proposed to the City Hall a project of magnificent Calvary comprising three churches and 22 chapels, probably based on the architectural design of major historian, cartographer and architect Samuel Mikoviny. The owners of the land in the year 1744 released the top of the hill with its western slope to the city in order to allow implementation of the Calvary complex as proposed by the Father Perger. After considering, the magistrate finally on 13 March 1744 agreed to, and provided the initial funding by the sum of 300 Goldens. Municipality Bansk√° ≈†tiavnica presented on 22 May 1744 a demand to ecclesiastical authority for approval to build Calvary according to this project under the auspices of the city of Bansk√° ≈†tiavnica. Archbishop of Esztergom (resident in Trnava) Imrich Esterh√°zy (1725‚Äì1745) adopted the request and his approval reached the municipality on 13 August 1744.http://www.kalvaria.org Link to official website of calvary in Bansk√° ≈†tiavnica Immediately preparation work was begun ‚Äì treatments of the ground and import of materials on the site. The cornerstone was solemnly blessed by the presence of large numbers of believers and the priesthood on the Feast of Exaltation of the holy Cross ‚Äì on 14 September in 1744. The first building was the \\"Upper Church\\". All works have been directed by the creator of the idea ‚Äì the Jesuit Father Francis Perger S.J. Local masons, carpenters, stonemasons, woodcarvers worked there as well as painters and other professionals. The wooden reliefs from Calvary chapels and wood carvings from the Upper church are attributed to the workshop of Dionysius Stanetti (1710‚Äì1767), a major baroque sculptor, established in the city of Kremnica. The upper church has been painted by Austrian baroque painter Mr. Anton Schmidt, born and graduated in Vienna, settled in the city of Bansk√° ≈†tiavnica. Before completion of works, they started pilgrimages to the Calvary hill Bansk√° ≈†tiavnica. On 14 September 1745, the Upper Church has been solemnly blessed and the first holy Mass took place there, visited by pilgrims who came out of the city in a procession with flags. Also in 1746, on the Feast of the Finding and Exaltation of the holy Cross, processions came to Calvary. That year, they finished the Holy Sepulchre ‚Äì chapel and the lower church of the calvary. Even after these years, in spite of continuing works of construction and equipment of churches and chapels, pilgrims came on 14 September, not only from ≈†tiavnica, but also from the environment. On the Feast of the Holy Trinity in 1751, they visited the calvary prominent guests, among them the Emperor Francis of Lorraine. The whole Calvary complex of Bansk√° ≈†tiavnica was built and churches and chapels equipped in less than seven years. The ceremonial blessing took place on 14 September 1751. The festive mass was preached in the Germanic and Slovak languages, the Germanic sermon given by the popular father Francis Perger. Total costs of Calvary Bansk√° ≈†tiavnica reached 25 899 Golds (not counting the labor of generous believers who worked on this work willingly for free). Records mention several physical healings for ≈†tiavnica Calvary.http://www.kalvaria.org Link to official website of calvary in Bansk√° ≈†tiavnica  History and reconstructions  In 1894, some chapels have been repaired and restored by the architect Mr. William J. Groszmann and carver Mr. Krause from Bansk√° ≈†tiavnica. Serious damages to Calvary complex were caused during WW II. in 1945 when the Red army pushed fascist troops out from the city. Efforts to reconstruct Calvary began after 1953, when chaplain Emil Scheimer, a native of Banska Hodru≈°a, later canon of Topoƒæƒçianky, started to mobilise the reconstruction works in person. The largest maintenance, renewal and partial restoration work was done between 1978‚Äì1981, under the parish administrator Father Karol Be≈àovic, SVD. The three lowest chapels were moved higher into the slope of Calvary and they began with restoration works. The state of the Calvary in the first decade of the 21st century was marked by the passing of time, but it also became the victim of vandalism and theft of the art decor and furnishings. The Calvary has been scarred not only by the ravages of time, but also by human negligence and malice. Some of the moveable artistic decoration was stolen, some has been targeted by vandals. The extent of the cultural and historic losses in the period 1989-2004 is incalculable. After the last destructive attack of vandals in the spring of 2004, the original elements of the decoration of Calvary (wood reliefs and sculptures) have been gradually moved into safety. This became the impetus for organizing the exhibition ‚ÄûCalvary in Asylum‚Äú. Calvary chapels and churches were deprived of original furniture by moving of the original reliefs and sculptures, but it was essential for their conservation. In early 2007, conservationists managed to enter this complex on the World Monument Fund‚Äôs list of the 100 most endangered monuments in the world. This provided an important catalyst for action to prevent further devastation of the Calvary, and to take steps to restore and rescue the most vulnerable parts of the original. Restoration, preservation and revitalization of Calvary Bansk√° ≈†tiavnica is provided from the beginning of 2008 by the civic association ‚ÄûThe Calvary Fund‚Äú,Kalv√°rsky fond, http://www.kalvaria.org/zakladne-info/ that after more than a half century built on the good experience of structure with the same name, operating since the establishment of Calvary Bansk√° ≈†tiavnica until its suspension by the communist regime after World War II. After complete restoration of the Lower Church in 2013, restoration of 18 chapels, the revitalization of the whole area, the Upper Church was completed on 12 October 2018, which ended the main phase of the reconstruction. The restoration works are currently focused on renovation of the Holy stairs (the Middle church) and Chapel of Jesus¬¥Tomb as well as gradual completion of the sculptural decoration of damaged or stolen statues. The original construction of Calvary was made possible thanks to the donors who decided to financially support its construction, or participate with their own efforts. And now its reconstruction and restoration is being made possible thanks to massive support from sponsors ‚Äì corporations, private companies, Ministry of Culture of the Slovak Republic and private individuals ‚Äì and also thanks to the help of many volunteers. The main work done during the years 2008 ‚Äì 2018 ‚Äì Complete restoration of the Lower Church: restoration of facades, frescoes, altars and relief of The Last Supper, installation of infrastructure and technical facilities, repair of the roof, stairs, tiles, doors and gratings ‚Äì Building of a natural amphitheatre behind the Lower Church ‚Äì Electrification of the area, sewage system, opening of the exhibition in the Lower church ‚Äì Recovery of most chapels, restoration of the chapel Ecce Homo ‚Äì Complete reconstruction of the sculpture The Virgin Mary ‚Äì Revitalisation of green areas, treatment of the alley, partial repair of the path, walls and stairs ‚Äì Complete restoration of the Upper Church: restoration of facades, frescoes, altar, roofs, lookout tower, portal and statues of 3 crucified and building of security system ‚Äì Building of the new Infocenter at the base of the Calvary ‚Äì Launch of the evening lighting for the Upper church and several chapels ‚Äì Gradual completion of sculptural decoration ‚Äì Publication of the guide Pilgrimage through the Calvary of Bansk√° ≈†tiavnica The Calvary is again a very popular touristic site.

The 157th FS is one of the few Air National Guard squadrons to operate the HARM Targeting System (HTS)-equipped F-16C Block 52 Fighting Falcon, also known as the F-16CJ. History World War II : see: 353d Fighter Group for full World War II history Activated in late 1942. Trained under First Air Force in northeastern United States with P-40 Warhawks, also performing Air Defense as part of Norfolk and Philadelphia Fighter Wings. Deployed to European Theater of Operations, June 1943, being equipped with P-47 Thunderbolts in England. Assigned as a heavy bomber escort squadron under VIII Fighter Command. Re-equipped with long-range P-51D Mustangs, July 1944, Thunderbolts being transferred to IX Fighter Command as tactical fighter-bombers supporting ground forces in France. Performed bomber escort missions until the end of the war in Europe, April 1945. Squadron demobilized in England during the summer of 1945, inactivated in United States as a paper unit, October 1945. South Carolina Air National Guard North American P-51D Mustang, AF Ser. No. 44-73699, assigned to the 157th in 1946. Note the \\"NG\\" on the tail, indicating the photo was taken before the Air National Guard was established in September 1947 The wartime 350th Fighter Squadron was re-activated and re-designated as the 157th Fighter Squadron, and was allotted to the South Carolina Air National Guard, on 24 May 1946. It was organized at Congaree Air Base, Columbia, South Carolina and was extended federal recognition on 9 December 1946 by the National Guard Bureau. The 157th Fighter Squadron was bestowed the history, honors, and colors of the 350th Fighter Squadron and assigned to the Georgia ANG 54th Fighter Wing, an umbrella organization formed for administrative and logistical support for many Air National Guard units in the southeastern United States. It remained, however, under the operational control of the South Carolina Air National Guard. The 157th was equipped with F-51D Mustangs and was assigned an air defense mission for the state of South Carolina. In 1950 the 157th was re- equipped with former World War II F-5 Mustangs, now designated RF-51D which had been used in the United States in a training role. The squadron became part of Tactical Air Command (TAC) as a Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron. =Korean War activation= The 157th Fighter Squadron was federalized due to the Korean War on 10 October 1950. On 1 November the RF-51 Mustangs were transferred to other units and the 157th was re-equipped with RF-80A Shooting Star photo-reconnaissance jets and transferred to Lawson AFB, Georgia. At Lawson, the wartime 117th Tactical Reconnaissance Group was formed with the 157th along with the 160th TRS (Alabama ANG) with RF-80As and the 112th TRS (Ohio ANG) with RB-26C Invader Night Reconnaissance aircraft. The 117th Tactical Reconnaissance Group was assigned to Ninth Air Force, Tactical Air Command. The 117th TRG then began what was then believed to be a short transition training period. The original plan was to deploy the 117th to France and reinforce the United States Air Forces in Europe at a new base in France, Toul-Rosi√®res Air Base. However Toul Air Base was still under construction, and delays in France for several reasons forced the 117th to remain at Lawson AFB for over a year until finally receiving deployment orders in January 1952. The 117th arrived at Toul Air Base on 27 January 1952. However at the time of the Wing's arrival, Toul AB consisted of a sea of mud, and the new jet runway was breaking up and could not support safe flying. The commander of the 117th deemed it uninhabitable and its flying squadrons of the wing were ordered dispersed to West Germany. The 112th TRS was transferred to Wiesbaden AB, the 157th TRS deployed to F√ºrstenfeldbruck AB, and the 160th deployed to Neubiberg AB. The non-flying Headquarters and Support organizations were assigned to Toul. The mission of the 117 TRW was to provide tactical, visual, photographic and electronic reconnaissance by both day and night, as was required by the military forces within the European command. The RF-80s were responsible for the daylight operations; the RB-26s for night photography. In June 1952, the 117th was involved in Exercise 'June Primer'. This exercise took place in an area bordered by a line drawn from Cherbourg to Geneva in the east and in the west by this Swiss, Austrian and Russian occupation zone borders. The two RF-80 squadrons of the 117th had to complete a number of varying missions, including vertical photography of prospective paratroop air drop zones, oblique photos of the Rhine and Danube river bridges, vertical photography of the airfields of Jever, Fassburg, Celle, Sundorf and G√ºtersloh and various visual missions on behalf of the seventh army, including artillery adjustment for the 816th field artillery. The 157 TRS had had wire recorders fitted to five of its RF-80s prior to June Primer and these greatly facilitated the latter missions. By July 1952 the facilities at Wiesbaden AB were becoming very crowded, and it was felt that the B-26's could fly from the primitive conditions at Toul. The 112 TRS returned to Toul, however the jet-engined RF-80s remained in West Germany until a new runway was constructed. On 9 July 1952 the activated Air National Guard 117 TRW was released from active duty and inactivated in place and its mission was taken over by the newly activated 10th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing. All of the aircraft and support equipment remained at Toul and was transferred to the 10th TRW. =Air Defense= 157th FIS 3-ship F-86L Sabre Interceptor aircraft formation, 1959 After returning from West Germany, the squadron was re-formed at Congaree Air Base and the South Carolina Air National Guard assumed an air defense mission. Due to the lack of jet aircraft in the United States (most were being used in the Korean War), the 157th was re-equipped with very long-range F-51H Mustangs and the unit was allocated to the Eastern Air Defense Force, Air Defense Command (ADC). After the Korean Armistice in 1953, the 157th began to receive F-86A Sabre jets, pressed into the daylight interceptor mission by ADC. In 1954, the Mustangs were reaching the end of their service life, and ADC supplied the 157th with some F-80C Shooting Stars as an interim replacement. On 5 September 1957, the 157th Fighter-Bomber Squadron was authorized to expand to a group level, and the 169th Fighter- Interceptor Group was established by the National Guard Bureau. The 157th was re-designated as a Fighter-Interceptor squadron and became the group's flying squadron. Other squadrons assigned into the group were the 169th Headquarters, 169th Material Squadron (Maintenance), 169th Combat Support Squadron, and the 169th USAF Dispensary. 157th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron Convair F-102A Delta Dagger, AF Ser. No. 56-1048, 1973. Shortly afterwards Air Defense Command upgraded the new 169th FIG to the all-weather/day-night F-86L Sabre Interceptor aircraft. In 1960 ADC released all its F-104A Starfighters to the ANG because the F-104 fire control system was not sophisticated enough to make it an all-weather interceptor.McMullen, Richard F. (1964) \\"The Fighter Interceptor Force 1962‚Äì1964\\" ADC Historical Study No. 27, Air Defense Command, Ent Air Force Base, CO (Confidential, declassified 22 March 2000), p. 6 The 157th was one of three selected ANG units to receive the Starfighter Mach-2 interceptors. The \\"Swamp Foxes\\", as a result of the national recognition as one of the best air defense units in the nation, were chosen to fly the new high performance jet fighter. Brigadier General Barnie B. McEntire, Jr., the first commander of the South Carolina ANG and its first general officer died 25 May 1961, when he courageously piloted his malfunctioning F-104 fighter jet away from populated areas near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, to crash into the Susquehanna River. On 1 October 1961, then-Governor Ernest F. Hollings presided over the ceremony renaming the heroic wing commander's South Carolina installation from Congaree Air Base to McEntire Air National Guard Base. The 169th FIG was called into active service a second time in November 1961 as the construction of the infamous \\"Berlin Wall\\" pushed the world to the brink of war. Within a month after mobilization, 750 personnel and 22 157th FIS F-104 aircraft were in place at Mor√≥n Air Base, Spain as the unit took up flying daily air defense patrols as part of the NATO air defense force in Western Europe. With world tension easing, the squadron returned home in August 1962. Following the Cuban Missile Crisis, ADC decided to make a permanent fighter unit at Homestead Air Force Base an F-104 unit because of its superior fighter-on-fighter performance. The F-104's lack of an all-weather capability not a factor because Cuba lacked a bomber force.McMullen, p. 18 In June 1963 the F-104s were transferred back to the active-duty Air Force. The South Carolina ANG was re-equipped with F-102A Delta Daggers, which became available because of Project Clearwater, which withdrew F-102s from overseas bases.McMullen, p. 51 The \\"Deuce\\", still a very potent interceptor, served with the 169th FIG until April 1975, when Aerospace Defense Command was reducing the USAF interceptor force as the threat of Soviet Bombers attacking the United States was deemed remote. =Tactical Air Command= A-7D Corsair II, AF Ser. No. 71-0364, 157th Tactical Fighter Squadron, about 1976 With the phase-down of continental air defenses in the 1970s, the 169th was transferred to Tactical Air Command (TAC), and was re-designated a Tactical Fighter Group. The 157th Tactical Fighter Squadron began to receive A-7D Corsair II subsonic tactical close air support aircraft from Tactical Air Command units that were preparing to receive the new A-10 Thunderbolt II. Receiving its aircraft from the 354th TFW at Myrtle Beach AFB and the 355th TFW at Davis-Monthan AFB, Arizona. The aircraft had excellent accuracy with the aid of an automatic electronic navigation and weapons delivery system. Although designed primarily as a ground attack aircraft, it also had limited air-to-air combat capability. In 1982, the 157th received new twin-seat A-7K trainers. Swamp Foxes in Operation Desert Storm, Air National Guard Art, 1992 In the early 1980s, the South Carolina congressional delegation in Congress, led by Senators Strom Thurmond and Ernest Hollings, pressured the Department of Defense to upgrade Army and Air National Guard units with front line equipment to better supplement the Active Duty forces as part of the \\"Total Force\\" concept. Specifically, Thurmond and Hollings wanted the Air Force to equip the South Carolina ANG with the new F-16 Fighting Falcon, which was, as the time, just being introduced into the active duty force of Tactical Air Command. Beginning in July 1983, some of the initial Block 1 and Block 5 F-16As were transferred to the 169th Tactical Fighter Group, being the first Air National Guard unit to receive the aircraft. Its A-7Ds were subsequently reassigned to other Air National Guard units. Later, Block 10 F-16A/B were delivered by the Air Force to the 157th TFS. By the mid eighties all the F-16s received by the 169th had undergone Pacer Loft modification bringing them up to the same block 10 standard. With the equipment change to the F-16, the 169th was assigned to the air defense mission again under Air Defense, Tactical Air Command (ADTAC), which was established when TAC assumed the Aerospace Defense Command mission in 1979. In addition, although the F-16s weren't adapted to perform in the tactical close air support mission that the A-7D was utilized for, the 157th TFS did practice the conventional attack role with Mark 82 (Mk 82) and Mark 84 (Mk 84) gliding bombs. The quality of the pilots and ammunition/maintenance crews of the 157th TFS was demonstrated during Gunsmoke '89 held at Nellis AFB from 1 October till 14 October. The 157th TFS took first place out of 15 other teams. In December 1990, during the buildup for war during Operation Desert Shield, the 157th was federalized for a third time and was deployed to Prince Sultan Air Base, Al Kharj, Saudi Arabia just a year and a half after taking first place at Gunsmoke '89. The 157th Tactical Fighter Squadron (Provisional) flew a total of 1,729 combat sorties during Operation Desert Storm. A total mission rate of over 90% was achieved, which was quite a remarkable feat. =Post Cold War era= 157th FS F-16CJ, AF Ser. No. 93-0535 over, Hilton Head Island, SC, about 2000 Early in the 1990s with the declared end of the Cold War and the continued decline in military budgets, the Air Force restructured to meet changes in strategic requirements, decreasing personnel, and a smaller infrastructure. The 169th adopted the new USAF \\"Objective Organization\\" in early 1992, with the word \\"tactical\\" being eliminated from its designation and becoming the 169th Fighter Group. Tactical Air Command was inactivated on 1 June, being replaced by the new Air Combat Command (ACC). In 1995, the 157th Fighter Squadron became the recipient of brand-new Block 52 F-16C/D Fighting Falcons coming straight from the Lockheed facility at Fort Worth, Texas. The 169th Fighter Group becoming the first AirNational Guard unit to receive these state-of-the-art aircraft. The mission profile of the unit changed in the way that they became a multi-role squadron being able to perform all kind of missions. More specifically they also received the HARM Targeting System being able to fly anti-radar sorties with the AGM-88 anti- radar missile. 157th Tactical Fighter Squadron ‚Äì 3 F-16A Formation ‚Äì 1989 The main mission profile of the squadron therefore changed to that of Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD). The 157th Fighter Squadron continues to fly the SEAD mission today. Also, on 11 October 1995 ACC and the National Guard Board authorized the status of the 169th to be expanded to the Wing level, and the 157th Fighter Squadron became part of the new 169th Operations Group under the new 169th Fighter Wing. In mid-1996, the Air Force, in response to budget cuts, and changing world situations, began experimenting with Air Expeditionary organizations. The Air Expeditionary Force (AEF) concept was developed that would mix Active-Duty, Reserve and Air National Guard elements into a combined force. Instead of entire permanent units deploying as \\"Provisional\\" as in the 1991 Gulf War, Expeditionary units are composed of \\"aviation packages\\" from several wings, including active-duty Air Force, the Air Force Reserve Command and the Air National Guard, would be married together to carry out the assigned deployment rotation. In February 1997, the 157th Expeditionary Fighter Squadron (157 EFS) was first formed from 169th FW personnel and aircraft and deployed to Doha International Airport, Qatar, to join with other active-duty and national guard squadrons as part of Operation Southern Watch. This mission was initiated mainly to cover for attacks of Iraqi forces on the Iraqi Shi‚Äôite Muslims. This made the 169th the first Air National Guard unit to deploy alongside active-duty Air Force units to comprise an Air Expeditionary Force (AEF). The 157th EFS was activated again in January 2000 as a component of Operation Northern Watch; a United States European Command Combined Task Force (CTF) who was responsible for enforcing the United Nations mandated no-fly zone above the 36th parallel in Iraq. This mission was a successor to Operation Provide Comfort which also entailed support for the Iraqi Kurds. The deployment was completed in April 2000. The 157th EFS was formed again in March 2001, when the unit deployed to Prince Sultan AB, Saudi Arabia in a second Operation Southern Watch deployment. The guardsmen returned to McIntire JGB in July. =Global War on Terrorism= 157th Expeditionary Fighter Squadron F-16C Block 52P Fighting Falcon, AF Ser. No. 92-3899, Kandahar Airfield, Afghanistan, 21 May 2012 In 2002, aircraft and personnel from the 169th deployed to Southwest Asia in support of Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and participated directly in combat operations. Also that year, 50 South Carolina ANG airmen, then assigned to the 240th Combat Communications Squadron, deployed to Central Asia for six months in support of the Global War on Terrorism, and the 245th ATCS deployed to Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. In 2003, nearly 400 Airmen from the 169th and all its F-16s were mobilized and deployed to Southwest Asia as part of what became Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF). The 169th was attached to the 379th Air Expeditionary Wing, stationed in Qatar, and flew more than 400 combat missions (performing the Suppression and Destruction of Enemy Air Defenses mission and flying numerous precision bombing missions over Iraq. 157th EFS F-16C, AF Ser. No. 92-3914, at Balad AB, Iraq, 2010 In 2005, the Base Realignment and Closure Commission announced an historic expansion at McEntire. Five more Block 52 F-16s from the active duty USAF would arrive at the base in 2006 and five more the following year. Then, in 2007, active duty Air Force personnel began arriving at McEntire as the base prepared to host and operate the largest Active Association unit in the nation's Combat Air Forces, bringing about 150 active duty personnel on board to work, train and deploy with the 169th. In May 2010, the 169th became the first Air National Guard unit to support an AEF mission for a full 120 days. While simultaneously deploying Airmen for Operation Enduring Freedom, the wing deployed more than 300 Airmen in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom, during which the 169th flew more than 800 combat air patrol missions over Iraq from Balad AB and other locations. The unprecedented deployment also allowed the 169th team to escort the last Army combat forces out of Iraq on the last day of OEF. Starting in October 2010 the 157th FS began an Air Sovereignty Alert mission at nearby Shaw AFB. The squadron gradually took over the alert duties of the 20th Fighter Wing and, on 6 May 2011, the squadron completely took over the role when a new alert facility was built at McEntire Joint National Guard Base. Most recently, in April 2012, the 157th EFS was formed and deployed with pilots, maintenance specialists and support staffers. They provided air support to ground units from Kandahar Airfield, Afghanistan. Pilots flew more than 2,200 sorties for a total of 9,400 combat hours. The four-month deployment ended in late August.

Service history Spanish Navy Isla de Cuba was built in 1886‚Äì87 for the Spanish Navy by Sir W.G. Armstrong Mitchell & Company, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom as a second-class protected cruiser. She fought in the Battle of Manila Bay in the Philippines during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War in 1898, suffering light damage, and was scuttled after the battle. Upon completion, Isla de Cuba joined the Metropolitan Fleet in Spain. She participated in the Rif War of 1893‚Äì1894, bombarding the reef between Melilla ad Chafarinos. When the Philippine Revolution of 1896‚Äì1898 broke out in the Philippines, Isla de Cuba was sent there to join the squadron of Rear Admiral Patricio Montojo de Pasaron. She was still part of Montojo's squadron when the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War began in April 1898. She was anchored with the squadron in Ca√±acao Bay under the lee of the Cavite Peninsula east of Sangley Point, Luzon, eight miles southwest of Manila, when, early on the morning of 1 May 1898, the United States Navy's Asiatic Squadron under Commodore George Dewey, found Montojo's anchorage and attacked. The resulting Battle of Manila Bay was the first major engagement of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War.Nofi, p. 17‚Äì23 The wreck of Isla de Cuba. The American squadron made a series of firing passes, wreaking great havoc on the Spanish ships. At first, Dewey's ships concentrated their fire on Montojo's flagship, unprotected cruiser , and on unprotected cruiser , and Isla de Cuba suffered little damage. When Reina Cristina was disabled, Isla de Cuba and her sister ship, Isla de Luz√≥n, came alongside the sinking Reina Cristina to assist her under heavy American gunfire. Admiral Montojo shifted his flag to Isla de Cuba. When Montojo's squadron had been battered into submission, Isla de Cuba was scuttled in shallow water to avoid capture. Her upper works remained above the water, and a team from gunboat went aboard and set Isla de Cuba on fire. After the United States occupied the Philippines, the United States Navy seized, salvaged, and repaired Isla de Cuba and commissioned her as a gunboat 1900 for service in the Philippines. The U.S. Navy took possession of her, refloated her, and repaired her damage. The Spanish guns were removed and replaced with guns mounted on her forecastle and poop deck.Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships 1860‚Äì1905, p. 166 United States Navy Isla de Cuba was commissioned into the U.S. Navy as USS Isla de Cuba on 11 April 1900 at Hong Kong, China, with Lieutenant J. N. Jordan in command. Following extensive repairs and shakedown out of Hong Kong, she was assigned to the Asiatic Station where she served in several capacities during the revolutionary unrest in the Philippines (see Philippine Revolution) following the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. As a supply ship and patrol boat she cruised the Philippine Islands. At Ormoc, Leyte, on 17 November 1900, she sent a battalion ashore to hold the town while the U.S. Army garrison leader was away on an expedition against the Philippine insurgents, remaining there in support of the battalion until 8 December. In 1901, she made a survey of Ormoc anchorage and Parasan Harbor; and in March‚ÄìApril 1900 as a unit of the Southern Squadron, she rendered distinguished service in cutting off the Philippine insurgents' supplies in Samar; in helping to capture Vicente Lukb√°n, the insurgent leader in Samar; in contributing to the general defeat of the insurgents; and in maintaining the close blockade of the island of Samar ‚Äî all of which contributed to the final declaration of an armistice. Isla de Cuba ended her service with the Asiatic Station when she departed Cebu for the United States on 4 March 1904. Decommissioning on 9 June at Portsmouth, New Hampshire, she remained there undergoing repairs until 21 March 1907, when she was loaned to the Naval Militia of Maryland for use as a school ship. She was sold at Charleston, South Carolina, to the Republic of Venezuela on 2 April 1912. Renamed Mariscal Sucre, after Marshall Antonio Jos√© de Sucre, she served Venezuela until she was scrapped in 1940. Technical characteristics In January 1886, Spain placed orders for two small protected cruisers, and Isla de Cuba with the British shipbuilding company Armstrongs to be built at their Elswick, Tyne and Wear shipyard.Brook 1999, p. 65. The ship was built with a main armament of six guns, with a secondary battery of four 6-pounder (57 mm guns), and three torpedo tubes. The ship's protective armour deck had a thickness of between , while the ship's conning tower had of armour. She was laid down on 25 February 1886, launched on 11 December 1886, and completed on 22 September 1887.The Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War Centennial Website: Isla de Cuba She had a steel hull and one funnel.Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships, p. 384 Having a wide beam for her length, she had poor seakeeping qualities and tended to bury her bow in waves.

The World War II Japanese holdouts on Anatahan also inspired a 1998 novel, Cage on the Sea. It was the final work directed by noted Hollywood director Josef von Sternberg (although Jet Pilot was released later). Von Sternberg had an unusually high degree of control over the film, made outside the studio system, which allowed him to not only direct, but also write, photograph, and narrate the action. Although it opened modestly well in Japan, it did poorly in the US, where von Sternberg continued to recut the film for four more years. He subsequently abandoned the project and went on to teach film at UCLA for most of the remainder of his lifetime. The film was screened within the official selection during the 14th Venice Film Festival (1953). The art director was Takashi Kono, special effects were made by Eiji Tsuburaya and the camera operator was Kozo Okazaki.Full cast and crew for Anatahan. IMDB, accessed 20 May 2009. Plot Josef von Sternberg directed, photographed and provides the voice-over narration and wrote the screenplay (from a novel based on actual events by Michiro Maruyana translated by Younghill Kang) about twelve Japanese seamen who, in June 1944, are stranded on an abandoned-and-forgotten island called An-ta-han for seven years. The island's only inhabitants are the overseer of the abandoned plantation and an attractive young Japanese woman. Discipline is represented by a former warrant officer but ends when he suffers a catastrophic loss of face. Soon, discipline and rationality are replaced by a struggle for power and the woman. Power is represented by a pair of pistols found in the wreckage of an American airplane, so important that five men pay for their lives in a bid for supremacy. Background Anatahan, an island of the Mariana Archipelago in the tropical Pacific was the scene of a wartime stranding of thirty Japanese sailors and soldiers and one Japanese woman in June 1944. The castaways remained in hiding until surrendering to a US Navy rescue team in 1951, six years after Japan was defeated by allied forces. Rosenbaum, 1978 The twenty who survived the ordeal were warmly received upon their return to post- war Japan. International interest, including an article in Life of 16 July 1951, inspired Josef von Sternberg to adapt the story to a fictional film rendering of the events. Rosenbaum, 1978Mizuno, 2009. p. 17 By the end of 1951, lurid personal accounts surfaced describing the deaths and disappearance arising from inter-male competition for the only woman on the island, Higo Kazuko. Mizuno, 2009 p. 9, 14, 17 These sensationalized depictions produced a backlash in popular opinion and sympathy for the survivors cooled. With the end of the post-war US occupation of Japan in 1952 saw a revival of political and economic sovereignty and a desire among the Japanese to suppress memories of wartime suffering. This ‚Äúrapid transformation of the political and social climate‚Äù influenced perceptions of Sternberg's Saga of Anatahan in Japan. Mizuno, 2009. p 19, 20-21, 22 Daiwa and Towa Corporations Daiwa Productions, Inc., an independent Japanese film production company, was founded in 1952 solely for the purpose of making the film Saga of Anatahan. The co-executives included film director Josef von Sternberg, Nagamasa Kawakita and Yoshio Osawa, the latter two entrepreneurial international film distributors. Mizuno, 2009. p 10-11Baxter, 1971. p. 169-170 Kawakita established the Towa Trading Company in 1928 to promote an exchange of Japanese and European films in ‚Äúthe urban art cinema market.‚Äù He also acted as a representative for German film corporation UFA GmbH in Japan. German director-producer Arnold Fanck joined with Kawakita in 1936 to produce the German-Japanese propaganda film The Daughter of the Samurai (entitled The New Earth in English language releases and Die Tocher der Samuri in Germany) to foster mutual cultural bonds between the countries. Filmed entirely in Japan, the high-profile, big-budget feature was endorsed and promoted by Reich Minister of Propaganda Josef Goebbels in Nazi Germany, where it opened to critical acclaim in 1937.Mizuno, 2009. p 11-12 Sternberg travelled to Japan in 1937 shortly after ending his professional ties with Paramount and Columbia Pictures. He met with Japanese critics and film enthusiasts who had studied and admired his silent and sound films. Producer Kawakita and director Fanck were filming The New Earth, and Sternberg visited them on location to discuss the possibilities for movie collaboration. When war broke out in 1939 the talks were suspended. Both Kawakita and Osawa served Imperial Japan throughout the war producing propaganda films in China and Japan, respectively. When Japan was defeated in 1945 the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers (SCPA) designated both producers as Class B war criminals, barring them from the Japanese film industry until 1950.Mizuno, 2009. p .13 Pre-production Sternberg reestablished contact with Kawakita in 1951 and in 1952 the producer agreed to finance a large-budget film based on the ‚ÄúAnatahan incident‚Äù, engaging the Toho company as distributor. Kazuo Takimura was hired as credited producer on the project (Kawakita and Osawa went un-credited). Eiji Tsuburaya, soon to be renowned for his Godzilla series, was hired as special effects director. The film score and sound effects were created by composer Akira Ifukube.Mizuno, 2009. p.14, 16-17 From his arrival in Japan in August 1952, Sternberg examined numerous accounts of the Anatahan affair (translated into English) and from among these selected the memoir of survivor Michiro Maruyama for adaption to film. Scriptwriter Tatsuo Asano was enlisted to add local vernacular to the film dialogue. Sternberg's narrative requirements reduced the number of participants to thirteen men and one woman and spanned the entire seven years they spent in isolation (the actual number of castaways in 1944 had been reported at 30-32 people, of whom twenty survived.)Mizuno, 2009. p. 14 Unable to obtain permission to use the Toho studio facilities in Tokyo, producer Osawa moved the project to the Okazaki Industrial Park in Kyoto, where the multiple open air set would be constructed. Sternberg arrived at the ad hoc studios with two Japanese interpreters and launched the painstaking collaborative process in which he would wield control over every aspect of the co-production. Mizuno, 2009. p.14Gallagher 2002Baxter, 1971. p. 174 A highly detailed storyboard was prepared ‚Äì ‚Äúthe Anatahan Chart‚Äù ‚Äì providing schematics for every aspect of the narrative. Flow charts for actors were color-coded to indicate timing and intensity of emotions, action and dialogue so as to dictate the ‚Äúpsychological and dramatic‚Äù continuity of each scene. These visual aids served, in part, to obviate misunderstandings related to language barriers (Sternberg spoke no Japanese and the crew and actors no English). Sternberg selected the actors based on ‚Äúhis first impression based on their appearance [and] disregard[ed] their acting skills.‚Äù The 33-year old Kozo Okazaki, a second unit cameraman, was drafted during pre-production to serve a cinematographer for the project. Virtually the entire movie was shot amid the stylized and highly crafted sets. Production began in December 1952 and ended in February 1953. Anatahan (entitled The Saga of Anatahan („Ç¢„Éä„Çø„Éè„É≥)) was released to Japanese audiences in June and July 1953. Mizuno, 2009 p. 15 ‚Äì 16, 17 Gallagher 2002 Post-production Sternberg added his narrative voice over to the film in post-production, with a translation in Japanese subtitles. The ‚Äúdisembodied‚Äù narration explains ‚Äúthe action, events and Japanese culture and rituals.‚Äù Mizuno, 2009 p. 17 A pamphlet was also produced by the director that provided a personal declaration to theatergoers, emphasizing that the production was not a historical rendering of an event during WWII, but a timeless tale of human isolation ‚Äì a universal allegory. Mizuno, 2009 p. 18-19 Reception When Sternberg arrived to begin pre-production in 1952 the dramatized and sometimes lurid renditions of the Anatahan events were widely circulating in the press. Critics questioned why Sternberg had adapted a story that might trigger \\"unpleasant feelings\\" among many Japanese who had been traumatized by war and defeat. The director issued press statements promising that his upcoming movie would be an artistic endeavor, pleasing to Japanese audiences, rather than a forensic recreation of a wartime disaster. Mizuno, 2009 p. 17 The Saga of Anatahan premiered in June 1953 following exhaustive publicity in major and local newspapers. Critical evaluation of the film was uniformly hostile, including a multi-journalist round-table published in Kinema Junpo. As film historian Sachiko Mizuno reports: Criticism was also directed at Sternberg for adopting a sympathetic attitude towards the lone woman on the island, Higa Kazuko (portrayed by Akemi Negishi) and the male survivors. Condemnation of the film was particularly harsh from critic Fuyuhiko Kitagawa, accusing Sternberg of moral relativism and being out of touch with Japanese post-war sentiments.Mizuno, 2009. p. 19-20Gallagher 2002 The premiere and first-run public showings in Tokyo and Kyoto received ‚Äúlukewarm‚Äù support. A modest commercial success, investors broke even on the project.Gallagher 2002 Kawakita presented The Saga of Anatahan at the Venice Film Festival in 1953 where it was overshadowed by another Kawakita entry, director Kenji Mizoguchi‚Äôs Ugetsu.Mizuno, 2009. p. 19 (see footnote 41) When Kawakita edited Anatahan for distribution in Europe, Sternberg‚Äôs ‚Äúmonotonous‚Äù narration was replaced with that of a Japanese youth, delivering the same text in broken English so as to make it more ‚Äúauthentically‚Äù Japanese to English speaking audiences. Mizuno, 2009. p. 19-20 According to Scott Eyman in Film Comment, The Saga of Anatahan received only ‚Äúa token theatrical release‚Äù in the United States in 1954. Eyman, 2017.

The formation is named after Gogo Station, a cattle station where outcrops appear and fossils are often collected from,\\"The Fossil Emblem of Western Australia\\" Accessed 16 August 2012. as is nearby Fossil Downs Station.  History  The reef, which now stands up abruptly in the western Australian desert (as the Windjana Limestone), was first identified in 1940 by paleontologist Curt Teichert, who discovered the first fossil fish from the region. It has been described for the layman by the driving force behind collecting expeditions at the Gogo Reef for the last two decades, John Long, of Museum Victoria in Melbourne, in Swimming in Stone: the Amazing Gogo Fossils of the Kimberley (Fremantle: Fremantle Arts Centre) 2007.  Sedimentology  Unweathered sections of the Gogo Formation are made of siltstone, shale and calcarenite with numerous limestone concretions. These concretions are resistant to weathering, producing extensive nodule fields on the ground in areas where the surrounding rock has eroded away. The Gogo sediments represent deep, hypoxic seafloor deposits in the vicinity of a large tropical reef composed primarily of algae and stromatoporoids during the Frasnian faunal stage of the Late Devonian. Associated stratigraphic units which comprise this ancient reef system are the Windjana Formation (the actual reef structures), Pillara Limestone (reef platform) and the Sadler Formation (fore-reef deposits).  Deposition  The formation was deposited in the Frasnian (late Devonian).  Fossil preservation  The fossils of the Gogo Formation display three-dimensional soft-tissue preservation of tissues as fragile as nerves and embryos with umbilical cords. Over fifty species of fish have been described from the formation, and arthropods (including phylocarids and eurypterids) are similarly well-preserved. Nautiloids, goniatites and tentaculids are also known from the formation, but their soft tissue is not preserved. The calcareous concretions formed around objects from the shallow reef areas which sank into the deep anoxic basins. The concretions sometimes contain the remains of fish, whose bodies are often preserved complete in three-dimensions due to rapid encasement and the slow rate of decay in the oxygen-poor surroundings. By repeated baths in a dilute acid solution, the matrix is dissolved away via a process of acid etching to reveal delicate fish fossils, some retaining impressions of soft tissues. The discovery of Materpiscis, a placoderm preserved with an embryonic juvenile still attached by its umbilical cord, has revealed that at least some placoderms gave birth to live young.\\"Aussie fish fossil gives birth to history\\" Accessed 29 May 2008.

Ferrer, 552 U.S. 346 (2008), was a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States holding that the Federal Arbitration Act (\\"FAA\\") overrules state laws declaring that certain disputes must be resolved by a state administrative agency. Alex Ferrer, who plays Judge Alex in a syndicated American courtroom television show, was notified of a demand for arbitration by Arnold Preston, a California attorney. Preston claimed Ferrer owed him fees under a \\"personal management\\" contract; in the contract, they had agreed to arbitrate disputes rather than bring them to court. Ferrer then petitioned the California Labor Commissioner, claiming the contract was invalid and unenforceable under California law, as Preston had allegedly acted as a talent agent without a license. Preston argued that he was not acting as a talent agent, and that an arbitrator, not a court, should decide whether this was the case. Citing Southland Corp. v. Keating, the Court noted that it had ruled consistently that the FAA was \\"a national policy favoring arbitration\\" when parties contract to settle disputes in that manner, and that it \\"foreclose[s] state legislative attempts to undercut the enforceability of arbitration agreements.\\" Citing two other previous Supreme Court rulings, the Court also noted that challenges to the validity of an entire contract are subject to the arbitration agreed to in the contract. Ferrer's argument was \\"unconvincing\\", the Court ruled, that state law required the exhaustion of administrative remedies before arbitration would commence. In a 4-sentence dissent, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote, \\"As I have stated on many previous occasions, I believe that the Federal Arbitration Act ... does not apply to proceedings in state courts.\\" Notes Arguing counsel: Joseph D.

Known from only one specimen, it is unique in having an unborn embryo present inside the mother, with remarkable preservation of a mineralised placental feeding structure (umbilical cord). This makes Materpiscis the oldest known vertebrate to show viviparity, or giving birth to live young. Discovery and naming The holotype was found in the Kimberley area of northern Western Australia by Lindsay Hatcher during the 2005 expedition to the Gogo led by John Long of Museum Victoria. Fossils from the Gogo Formation are preserved in limestone nodules, so dilute acetic acid is used to dissolve the surrounding limestone and reveal the fossil, often preserved in three dimensions with minimal distortion. The species was named Materpiscis attenboroughi in honour of David Attenborough who first drew attention to the significance of the Gogo fish sites in his 1979 series Life on Earth.BBC News: Fossil reveals oldest live birth Paleobiology Fossilised embryo featuresMaterpiscis would have been about long and had powerful crushing tooth plates to grind up its prey, possibly hard shelled invertebrates like clams or corals.Museum Victoria links and videos describing Materpiscis Examination of the tail section of the holotype led to the discovery of the partially ossified skeleton of a juvenile Materpiscis and the mineralised umbilical cord. The team published their findings in 2008. The juvenile Materpiscis was about 25 percent of its adult size. The large size of the embryo relative to the mother indicates that the young of this fish were born well-formed, a strategy that may have evolved to counter predation from other larger fishes. The ptyctodontid fishes are the only group of placoderms to display sexual dimorphism, where males have clasping organs and females have smooth pelvic fin bases. It had long been suspected that they reproduced using internal fertilisation, but finding fossilised embryos inside both Materpiscis and in a similar form also from Gogo, Austroptyctodus, proved the deduction was true.

Hall states that Jesus did \\"anything he wanted to do,\\" and, anachronistically, could have surpassed the achievements of Jimi Hendrix, Wayne Gretzky, and Mikhail Baryshnikov in their respective fields.

According to VMware, the product has a success rate of about 90‚Äì95 % in packaging applications.  History  ThinApp (previously known as Thinstall) was originally developed by Jitit Inc. and was acquired by VMware on January 15, 2008. VMware later used the code name VMware Project North Star while the product was in beta. On June 10, 2008, VMware announced that the final name for the product was going to be VMware ThinApp. The trial version of Thinstall was initially available only to corporations, then VMware offered a public trial version. Now, ThinApp is only available with the Horizon suite of products.  Technology  VMware ThinApp is an application virtualization solution. ThinApp is able to execute applications without them being installed in the traditional sense by virtualizing resources such as environment variables, files and Windows Registry keys. The virtual environment presented to the client is a merged view of the underlying physical and virtual resources, thereby allowing the virtualization layer to fool the application into thinking that it is running as if it were fully installed. ThinApp does not have any pre-installed components and does not require the installation of device drivers allowing applications to run from USB flash drives or network shares without ever requiring Administrator rights. ThinApp converts standard application installers such as .msi files into self-contained EXE files which includes everything required to run. Also it is able to scan a system before and after an application's installation and create a portable executable based upon changes made to the systems files and registry. Unlike self-extracting ZIP files, ThinApp does not extract files to disk or require system registry changes in order to run applications. ThinApp versions released after 5.2.3 drop support Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 and later. Editions The most \\"basic\\" version of ThinApp is \\"VMware ThinApp Starter Edition\\", offered for free with any purchase of VMware Workstation,http://www.vmware.com/products/workstation/thinapp-starter- edition.html while the most \\"advanced\\" version is \\"VMware ThinApp Enterprise Edition\\", which adds support for AppSync updating, Active Directory integration and allows usage by multiple users (both for the ThinApp Packager and ThinApp Client).

A pre-war ship of the same name was a member of the original \\"4 Aces.\\" SS Exochorda, a 473-foot, 14,500-ton cargo liner in service with American Export Lines from 1948 to 1959. A member of the line's post-war quartet of ships, \\"4 Aces\\", Exochorda sailed regularly from New York on a Mediterranean route. Originally built in 1944 as the military attack transport USS Dauphin (APA-97), the ship was extensively refurbished prior to her service as a passenger-cargo liner. Following her service as a cruise liner, the vessel served as the floating dormitory ship for the students of Stevens Institute of Technology, a technological university, in Hoboken, NJ. At the end of her service life she was scrapped, in 1979. Diverted for war service In 1944 American Export Lines built a new fleet of \\"4 Aces\\" ships, planned to replace the earlier, pre-war \\"4 Aces\\". However, the ships were requisitioned by the US Navy for service in World War II and converted to Windsor-class attack transport vessels. The vessel that would later become Exochorda served as Dauphin for the US Navy, from 1944 to 1948. Dauphin was awarded one battle star in the assault on and occupation of Okinawa and earned the Navy Occupation Service Medal for landing cargo and troops in Japan. She was present in Tokyo Bay for the Surrender Ceremony of World War II, 2 September 1945. Following the war, in November 1947, the ships were returned to dry dock at the Hoboken Yard of Bethlehem Steel Corporation for conversion back to passenger cargo ships for American Export Lines. Dauphin became Exochorda of the post-war \\"4 Aces\\", taking her new name from her predecessor in the pre-war fleet. Extensive Refurbishment Brochure photo of SS Exochorda's nearly identical sister ship SS Excalibur, circa 1961, in the New \\"4 Aces.\\" Fashioning the modern (1948) cruise liner Exochorda from Dauphin required stripping the vessel to the bare hull and machinery. An entirely new superstructure was built that included passenger staterooms located primarily on promenade and \\"A\\" decks. Noted industrial decorator Henry Dreyfuss, whose many designs included the \\"Twentieth Century Limited\\" locomotive (1938) for the New York Central Railroad, and the \\"500\\" desk telephone (1949), the Bell System standard for 45 years, designed the interiors. Zalud Marine Corporation executed the design, including joiner work, that included thousands of feet of carpet, specially woven fabrics and an unusual amount of glass. Exochorda was among the first ships with fully air-conditioned staterooms, many of which were also soundproofed. The ship's glass-enclosed promenade deck featured a built-in swimming pool and play area adjacent to a modern bar and smoking room. Sea safety standards were unusually high and included modern (1948) smoke detection, fire control and fireproofing. On the day following her final sea trials, 26 October 1948, the ship was formally delivered to American Export Lines at the company's terminal at Exchange Place, Jersey City, NJ. Delivery had been delayed due to a faulty valve that needed replacement. Exochorda departed on her maiden voyage November 1948. Artwork All artwork for the new 4 Aces ships had been selected by interior designer Henry Dreyfuss.

Originally posted on the cell phone website \\"Mah≈ç no iLand\\", where chapters would be released exclusively for mobile reading, Koizora received a hard print publication from Starts Publications in October 2006, with the story being separated into two volumes. Koizora is claimed to be a biographical account of Mika, or at least, based on first-hand accounts. It boomed in popularity and became a mass cultural phenomenon, spawning a theatrical film, a television drama adaptation, and a manga adaptation.  Plot  Mika Tahara has just started high school and yearns to fall in love. However, to her dismay, a gal-like boy in her grade, Nozomu, acquires her cell phone number and begins to call her frequently. When summer vacation starts, one day, Nozomu drunkenly phones her, but his friend Hiro confiscates the phone and converses with her instead. Although Mika does not know who Hiro is, she feels at ease at the sound of his voice and the two befriend each other. Mika and Hiro agree to meet each other when school starts, and to Mika's shock, Hiro turns out to be the delinquent boy she is afraid of, who proves his identity as the caller with a photo of the sky on his cellular phone. However, as she understands how gentle he is, they begin to fall in love with each other and face a multitude of challenges threatening their relationship, such as Hiro's ex-girlfriend Saki, who is still in love with Hiro. Although Hiro assures Mika that he broke up with her, Saki holds a vendetta against Mika and hires a group of men to rape Mika. The horrific encounter ends with Hiro and his older sister punishing Saki and the rapists, but not long after, someone writes a provocative message on all the school chalkboards, resulting in Mika being harassed over the phone. Despite these events, Hiro vows to protect Mika, and she begins to compare him to the sky. Soon after, Mika becomes pregnant after she and Hiro have an encounter in the library. Hiro is thrilled and gains his parents' approval to raise the child, although Mika's parents disapprove. Despite this, they are determined to raise the baby, until Mika has a miscarriage due to Saki pushing her down a set of stairs. Mika is told that she may not be able to become pregnant again. Despairing, Mika and Hiro build a grave for their daughter, and promise to visit annually on the day of the baby's death. During their second year in high school, Hiro discovers that he has cancer and makes the painful decision to break up with Mika to keep his condition from causing her pain, but secretly continues to follow her whereabouts through his high school friend, Nozomu. Although hurt, Mika gradually forgets about Hiro and meets a college student named Yu, who becomes sympathetic to her situation. The two date, and Yu even prevents Mika's parents from divorcing. On the first anniversary of the baby's death, Mika finds Hiro visiting the grave. On the second anniversary, she finds Nozomu instead. He reveals Hiro's condition to Mika and she makes a difficult decision to leave Y≈´ to go to his bedside. Upset that he pretended he didn't love her only to ensure she would have a happy future, she insists that only he can make her happy. Having Mika back, Hiro is determined to fight his disease and begins to improve as Mika takes an academic leave from college to visit him in the hospital. During a routine checkup, Hiro's condition takes a turn for the worse and he dies before Mika gets a chance to say good-bye to him. Mika is distraught by Hiro's death and attempts suicide by jumping off a bridge, but is stopped when two white doves fly towards the sky. She drops Hiro's diary, which was given to her after his death, and discovers a letter he wrote to her before he died. She learns that he had anticipated his death and was happy with the time he had spent with her. She decides to carry on with life, not just for herself, but for Hiro's sake as well. A month after Hiro's death, Mika discovers that she is pregnant by Hiro with another baby girl, and feels a sense of closure knowing that Hiro has left a new life behind for her. She is later on seen placing a pair of blue mittens for Hiro next to the smaller, pink ones that were meant for her baby and praying for both their happiness. Reception Approximately 20 million people subscribed to Koizora. The novel later received a hard print publication in October 2006 by Starts Publications and was published into two volumes. The books sold more than two million copies and became a mass cultural phenomenon in Japan. Joanna Mauermann of Reading Worldwide attributes the popularity of Koizora to the sensation of realism in that \\"they are modelled on the readers' own situation\\" and \\"[t]he strong presence of the characters, presented in dialogues and (inward) monologues, address the reader directly, and the emotional state of the main character is experienced immediately.\\" In addition to the empathy readers, the anonymity of the author attributes to the appeal of the Koizora. Much like the anonymous Densha Otoko, readers are more likely to tolerate exaggerated writing, first-hand accounts or not, due to how Mika's anonymity makes Koizora seem more \\"real\\" and \\"personal.\\" Despite its popularity, Koizora has been attacked for having sexual and violent material available to young readers. A grade school teacher criticized the novel for supporting the misconception in young girls that rape leads to love. She suggested that the story had induced prepubescent girls to fantasize about rape. Adaptations Manga Koizora was adapted into a manga series drawn by Ibuki Haneda and overseen by Mika herself. The manga was published by Futabasha Publishers under the \\"Comic Mahou no iRando\\" label and lasted for eight volumes, the first volume releasing on June 21, 2007 and the last on February 21, 2009. Film Koizora: Setsunai Koi Monogatari was loosely adapted into a theatrical film under the mononymous title Koizora. It was directed by Natsuki Imai and starred Yui Aragaki as Mika and Haruma Miura as Hiro. The film adaptation was released on November 3, 2007, with a gross revenue of and 3.14 million people attending the theater. It debuted at #3 on the box office. The DVD was released on April 25, 2008. Drama Koizora was also adapted into a TV drama series, which aired from August 2, 2008 to September 13, 2008, with a total of six episodes. From March to June 2008, auditions were held to choose the actor and actress for the two starring roles. Erena Mizusawa was chosen to play Mika, and Koji Seto as Hiro; there were a total of more than a thousand applicants. TBS broadcast the serial drama in prime-time, and the first audience rating was 5.6%.

These churches were built throughout the history of the Catholic Church, and today they can be found on every continent including Antarctica. The history of Marian church architecture tells the unfolding story of the development of Roman Catholic Mariology. The construction and dedication of Marian churches is often indicative of the Mariological trends within a period, such as a papal reign. For instance, the 1955 rededication by Pope Pius XII of the church of Saint James the Great in Montreal, with the new title Mary, Queen of the World, Cathedral, was a reflection of his being called \\"the most Marian pope\\". A year earlier, Pope Pius XII had proclaimed that title for the Virgin Mary in his 1954 encyclical Ad Caeli Reginam.Encyclical Ad Caeli Reginam on the Vatican website This encyclical on the Queen of Heaven is an example of how the interplay between churches and Marian art reinforces the effect of Marian devotions. The beginnings Santa Maria Antiqua, in the Forum Romanum, 5th century, seat of Pope John VII The New Testament indicates that the practice of meeting together was an important part of the Christian faith from the very early days: \\"let us not give up the habit of meeting together‚Ä¶ instead, let us encourage one another all the more\\" (Hebrews 10:25). Prior to the fourth century, Christians worshiped in private due to persecutions. After the edict of Milan was issued in 313, Christians were permitted to worship and build churches openly.Catholic encyclopedia The generous and systematic patronage of Roman Emperor Constantine I changed the fortunes of the Christian church, and resulted in both architectural and artistic development.Early Christian Art and Architecture by R. L. P. Milburn (Feb 1991) Univ California Press page 303 In the following decades, congregations built churches for public worship. The Church of Mary in Ephesus may be one of the earliest Marian churches and is dated to the early 5th century, coinciding with the Council of Ephesus in 431.Encyclopedia of Sacred Places by Norbert C. Brockman 2011 page 161 It may have been built specifically for the council, during which the title of Theotokos, God-bearer, for the Mother of Christ was decided.The Canons of the Two Hundred Holy and Blessed Fathers Who Met at Ephesus The first Marian churches in Rome: Santa Maria in Trastevere, Santa Maria Antiqua and Santa Maria Maggiore, date from the first part of the fifth century and house some of the earliest forms of public Marian art.Mary in Western Art by Timothy Verdon 2005 pages 37-40 The church of Santa Maria Maggiore is now a papal basilica, where the pope presides over the annual Feast of the Assumption of Mary (celebrated each 15 August) and the church includes major pieces of Roman Catholic Marian art.Art in Renaissance Italy by John T. Paoletti 2005 page 290 Some of the early Roman churches were quite small. An example is the church of Santa Maria Antiqua (i.e. ancient St. Mary) built in the 5th century in the Forum Romanum. Pope John VII used Santa Maria Antiqua in the early 8th century as the see of the bishop of Rome. This church includes the earliest Roman depiction of Santa Maria Regina, portraying the Virgin Mary as a Queen in the 6th century.Erik Thun√∏, 2003 Image and Relic: Mediating the Sacred in Early Medieval Rome page 34Bissera V.

The Basilica of the National Shrine of Our Lady of Aparecida in Aparecida, Brazil is now the second-largest Catholic place of worship in the world, second only to St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City. In 1984 it was officially declared as \\"the largest Marian Church in the world.\\"Religions of the World by J. Gordon Melton, Martin Baumann 2003 pages 308-309 Some Marian churches are major pilgrimage sites. According to Bishop Francesco Giogia, the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe in Mexico City was the most visited Catholic shrine in the world in 1999, followed by San Giovanni Rotondo (not a Marian shrine) and Our Lady of Aparecida in Brazil.Eternal Word Television Network, Global Catholic Network While in 1968 Aparecida had about four million pilgrims,Brazil rediscovered by Roberta C.

In December 2009, the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe set a new record with 6.1 million pilgrims during Friday and Saturday for the anniversary of Our Lady of Guadalipe. Progression of architecture and belief St. Mary's Basilica, Krak√≥w Through the centuries, the progression of Medieval architecture towards Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque and eventually modern Marian church architectures may be viewed as a manifestation of the growth of Marian belief - just as the development of Marian art and music were a reflection of the growing trends in the veneration of the Blessed Virgin Mary in the Roman Catholic tradition.Raymond Burke, 2008, Mariology: A Guide for Priests, Deacons, seminarians, and Consecrated Persons, Queenship Publishing page 189From Trent to Vatican Two by Raymond F. Bulman, Frederick J. Parrella 2006 Oxford UP pages 179-180 A good example of the continuation of Marian traditions from the Gothic period to the present day is found at St. Mary's Basilica, Krak√≥w in Poland. On every hour, a trumpet signal called the hejna≈Ç (meaning \\"St. Mary's dawn\\" and pronounced hey-now) is still played from the top of the taller of St. Mary's two towers, the noon-time hejna≈Ç being heard across Poland and abroad broadcast live by the Polish national Radio 1 Station.Let's go: Europe, 1979 by Harvard Student Agencies page 553Micha≈Ç Malinowski 2008 Polish folktales and folklore page 69 St. Mary's in Krak√≥w also served as an architectural model for many of the churches that were built by the Polish diaspora abroad, particularly St. Michael's and St. John Cantius in Chicago, designed in the so-called Polish Cathedral style.Theology In Stone: Church Architecture From Byzantium to Berkeley by Richard Kieckhefer 2004 pages 207-208 Popes have at times viewed the existence of Marian churches as a key to the spread of Marian devotions, e.g. as he entrusted Europe to the Virgin Mary, Pope John Paul II stated: \\"Thanks to the countless Marian shrines dotting the nations of the continent, devotion to Mary is very strong and widespread among the peoples of Europe.\\"Vatican website: Marian entrustment of Europe Apparition-based Marian churches Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes Marian apparitions have resulted in the construction of major Marian churches.Moved by Mary: The Power of Pilgrimage in the Modern World by Anna- Karina Hermkens, Willy Jansen 2009 page 217 Some of the very largest Roman Catholic Marian churches in the world did not start based on a decisions made by informed theologians in Rome but based on the statements of young and less- than-sophisticated people about their religious experiences on remote (and often unheard of) hilltops.Zenit NewsPilgrims to Our Lady of Guadalupe There are remarkable similarities in the accounts of the reported visions which have led to the construction of the churches.What Mary Means to Christians: An Ancient Tradition Explained by Peter Stravinskas 2012, Paulist Press chapter on \\"Lourdes, Fatima, Guadalupe\\"The Catholic Almanac's Guide to the Church by Matthew Bunson 2001 page 194 Two cases in point are the largest Marian churches in Mexico and France, based on the reported Marian apparitions to Saint Juan Diego in Cerro del Tepeyac, (Guadalupe) Mexico in 1531 and Saint Bernadette Soubirous as a child in Lourdes in 1858. Both saints reported visions in which a miraculous lady on a hill asked them to request that the local priests build a chapel at that site of the vision. Both visions had a reference to roses and led to very large churches being built at the sites. Like Our Lady of Lourdes in France, Our Lady of Guadalupe is a major Catholic symbol in Mexico. And like the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes in France, the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe complex is one of the largest and most visited Catholic churches in the Americas.Pilgrimage: from the Ganges to Graceland : an encyclopedia, Volume 1 by Linda Kay Davidson, David Martin Gitlitz 2002 page 213 Three Portuguese children, L√∫cia dos Santos, Jacinta and Francisco Marto were equally young and without much education when they reported the apparition of Our Lady of F√°tima in Cova da Iria, 1917. The local administrator initially jailed the children and threatened that he would boil them one by one in a pot of oil. Yet, eventually with millions of followers and Roman Catholic believers, the reported visions at Fatima gathered respect and Popes Pius XII, John XXIII, Paul VI, John Paul II, Benedict XVI and Pope Francis voiced their acceptance of the supernatural origin of the F√°tima, Portugal, events. The Sanctuary of Our Lady of F√°tima is now a major Marian church in Europe. The Shrine of Nostra Signora della Guardia in Genoa, Italy has a similar story. In 1490 a peasant Benedetto Pareto reported that the Virgin Mary had asked him to build a chapel on a mountain. Pareto reported that he replied that he was only a poor man and would not be able to do that, but he was told by the Virgin Mary: \\"Do not be afraid!\\". After falling from a tree, Pareto changed his mind and built a small wooden room that was eventually enlarged to the present shrine. And the trend has continued. The first approval for a Marian apparition in the 21st century was granted to the reported visions of Jesus and Mary by Benoite Rencurel in Saint-√âtienne-le- Laus in France from 1664 to 1718. The approval was granted by the Holy See in May 2008. Again, in this case, a young Benoite Rencurel (who could not read or write) reported that a lady in white appeared to her on a remote mountain top in Saint-√âtienne-le-Laus and asked her for a church to be built there.Benoite Rencurel Catholic News Agency Benoite Rencurel Catholic News Agency Catholic News AgencyCatholic News Agency In May 2016, the local ordinary of the Roman Catholic Diocese of San Nicol√°s de los Arroyos Bishop Cardelli approved as \\"worthy of belief\\" the apparitions associated with the Marian image of Our Lady of the Rosary of San Nicol√°s. A Shrine erected in honor of Mary under this title was inaugurated in 2014. Reports of unusually radiant, glowing rosary beads were followed by a number of brief visions of Our Lady appearing to housewife and mother-of-two Gladys Motta developed into a series of interior locutions over several years, beginning on October 13 the anniversary of apparitions at F√°tima. Specific messages led to the discovery‚Äîand restoration to veneration‚Äîof a long-neglected statue of a Madonna carrying the Christ Child. Occurring at the close of the twentieth century[2] the messages mirror those given at the beginning of the twentieth century to young shepherds in Portugal where the Virgin Mary reportedly identified herself as the Lady of the Rosary. Following approval of the spiritual merits by local religious authorities, a new church dedicated to Marian devotion under this title was erected as requested by Our Lady during the apparitions. Churches, icons and devotions Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe Major Marian churches at times house major Marian symbols or icons and the interplay between churches and these symbols can reinforce the effect of Marian devotions. For instance, the Borghese or Pauline Chapel of the Santa Maria Maggiore church houses Salus Populi Romani, which has historically been the most important Roman Catholic Marian art icon in Rome. On 1 April 1899, Eugenio Pacelli (later Pope Pius XII) celebrated his first Holy Mass there. Almost 50 years later, in 1953, Pius XII had Salus Populi Romani carried from Santa Maria Maggiore through Rome to initiate the first Marian year in Church history. In 1954, the icon was crowned by Pius XII as he introduced a new Marian feast Queenship of Mary with the encyclical Ad Caeli Reginam. Perhaps the ultimate example of this interplay is on Tepeyac hill, in Mexico, the site of the reported apparition of Our Lady of Guadalupe to Saint Juan Diego Cuauhtlatoatzin. The Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe on Tepeyac hill houses the tilma (cloak) of Saint Juan Diego on which the image of Our Lady of Guadalupe is said to have been miraculously imprinted, where he had gathered roses. Saint Juan Diego's tilma is a key national and religious icon in Mexico. The series of Marian churches on Tepeyac hill that have housed the tilma since 1531 have received an ever-increasing number of pilgrims and the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe (one of the largest churches in the world) was constructed in 1974 to accommodate the over 5 million pilgrims that arrive there every year. Architectural periods Santa Maria in Cosmedin The progress of Marian church architectures manifests both the progress of architecture and the spread of Marian devotions. If there is a single Marian location that captures several types of architecture, it is the area surrounding the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes. The Rosary Basilica was built with the Byzantine architecture in the 19th century. The \\"Basilica of the Immaculate Conception\\" known widely as the Upper Basilica, was consecrated in 1876 and is an elaborate building in the Gothic style, while the Basilica of St. Pius X, is a very modern building that was completed in 1958 and is almost entirely underground. Romanesque The basilica of Santa Maria in Cosmedin in the Forum Boarium in Rome is an early example of a Romanesque Marian church. It is the site of the famous La Bocca della Verit√†, an ancient Roman sculpture which draws many visitors every year. Speyer Cathedral (also known as the Mariendom) in Speyer, Germany is an imposing basilica of red sandstone and one of the largest Romanesque churches in the world. The distinctive colonnaded gallery that surrounds it and its imposing triple- aisled vaulted design influenced the development of Romanesque architecture in the 11th and 12th centuries. Our Lady of Flanders Cathedral in Tournai is one of the key architectural monuments in Belgium. It combines the work of three design periods: the heavy and severe character of the Romanesque nave contrasting with the Transitional work of the transept and the fully developed Gothic style of the choir. This early period, also included growth and development in other aspects of Mariology, with activities by key figures such as John Damascene and Bernard of Clairvaux. Chants such as Ave Maris Stella and the Salve Regina emerged and became staples of monastic plainsong. Devotional practices grew in number. The Ave Maria prayer gained popularity. Gothic Chartres Cathedral Notre Dame de Paris Cathedral is a prime example of French Gothic architecture. It was among the first buildings in the world to use the flying buttress. Its sculptures and stained glass show the heavy influence of naturalism, giving them a more secular look that was lacking from earlier Romanesque architecture. Chartres Cathedral near Paris is also a good example of a French Gothic cathedral. Its two contrasting spires and the complex flying buttresses that surround it capture key architectural elements of the time. Reims Cathedral, where the kings of France were once crowned, exemplifies the heavier Gothic architecture present in the northern Franco-Germanic areas. Further south, the fa√ßade of Santa Maria Assunta Cathedral in Siena Italy is an excellent example of Tuscan Gothic architecture by Giovanni Pisano. The interior of Notre-Dame Cathedral, Luxembourg shows the Gothic style of design at its height. The basilica is a good example of late gothic architecture with many Renaissance elements and adornments. One major Mariological issue in this period was the Immaculate Conception. Gradually the idea that Mary had been cleansed of original sin at the very moment of her conception began to predominate, particularly after Duns Scotus dealt with the major objection to Mary's sinlessness from conception, that being her need for redemption.Ludwig Ott, Fundamentals of Catholic Dogma, Mercier Press Ltd., Cork, Ireland, 1955 Popes issued degrees and authorized feasts and processions in honor of Mary. Pope Clement IV (1265‚Äì1268) created a poem on the seven joys of Mary, which in its form is considered an early version of the Franciscan rosary. Renaissance Dome of Basilica of Santa Maria del Fiore Perhaps the key example of early Renaissance Quattrocento Marian architecture is the Dome of Basilica of Santa Maria del Fiore in Florence, Italy. The cathedral was consecrated by Pope Eugene IV in 1436 and was the first 'octagonal' dome in history to be built without a wooden supporting frame and was the largest dome built at the time (it is still the largest masonry dome in the world). The facade of the Basilica of Santa Maria Novella in Florence is another example of the beginnings of the early Renaissance. The Basilica of Santa Maria delle Grazie (Milan), famous for the mural of the Last Supper by Leonardo da Vinci is an example of the progression of architecture beyond the Gothic period and towards the Renaissance. This period also saw unprecedented growth in venerative Marian art with the likes of Donatello, Sandro Botticelli, Masaccio, Filippo Lippi, Piero di Cosimo and Paolo Uccello among many others. Baroque Santa Maria della Salute, Venice The Santa Maria della Pace's Baroque fa√ßade, designed by Pietro da Cortona is a good example of a Marian church in Rome that progressed beyond the Renaissance. The Basilica of Our Lady of the Pillar in Zaragoza, Spain is a Baroque church built upon previous churches at the same site, dating back to the Romanesque period. Being a large rectangle with a nave and two aisles, with two other all-brick chapels, it has a typically Aragonese style and is illuminated by large oculi, characteristic of the buildings of the region from the 17th century onwards. Some Marian churches are built as a response to specific events, e.g. Santa Maria della Salute in Venice was built to give thanks to thank the Virgin Mary for the city's deliverance from the plague. The church is full of Marian symbolism ‚Äì the great dome represents her crown, and the eight sides the eight points on her symbolic star. Baroque literature on Mary experienced unforeseen growth with over 500 pages of Mariological writings during the 17th century alone with contributors such as Francisco Su√°rez, Lawrence of Brindisi, Robert Bellarmine and Francis of SalesA Roskovany, conceptu immacolata ex monumentis omnium seculrorum demonstrate III, Budapest 1873 After 1650, the Immaculate Conception was the subject of over 300 publications. In this period Saint Louis de Montfort wrote his highly influential Marian books that influenced several popes centuries later. Baroque Mariology was supported by Pope Paul V and Gregory XV. Alexander VII declared in 1661, that the soul of Mary was free from original sin. Pope Clement XI ordered the feast of the Immaculata for the whole Church in 1708. The feast of the Rosary was introduced in 1716, the feast of the Seven Sorrows in 1727. The Angelus prayer was strongly supported by Pope Benedict XIII in 1724 and by Pope Benedict XIV in 1742.F Z√∂pfl, Barocke Fr√∂mmigkeit, in Marienkunde, 577 Modern The modern period has witnessed unprecedented growth both for Marian churches and for papal and popular support for Marilogy, with a significant increase in the number of pilgrims to Marian shrines. Our Lady of Aparecida, Brazil, 1955 The Basilica of the National Shrine of Our Lady of Aparecida in Brazil is the largest cathedral in the world and is surpassed in size only by Saint Peter's Basilica in Vatican City. Two major Marian Basilicas were built in North America during the 20th Century in the capital cities of Mexico & the U.S. The first was the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception; Washington, DC. The original plans called for a gothic structure, but were changed in 1918. It was decided at that time to build a structure with a Romanesque exterior and a Byzantine- style interior.http://www.nationalshrine.com/site/c.osJRKVPBJnH/b.4719297/k.BF65/Home.htm From 1974 to 1976, a new Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe on Tepeyac hill, north of Mexico City, was built next to the 1709 church which was no longer safe due to weakened foundations. Both buildings are at the site of the apparition of Our Lady of Guadalupe to Saint Juan Diego Cuauhtlatoatzin. It is the most important pilgrimage site in Mexico and perpetual adoration takes place there by many people. By using its atrium, 40,000 people can attend mass at the basilica. Other Marian churches started to appear around the globe. The Basilica of Our Lady of She Shan was built near Shanghai China as the largest Christian church building in East Asia. The new Immaculate Conception Cathedral was built in Manila, Philippines and the Basilica of Our Lady of Candelaria in Tenerife, Spain. Our Lady of the Rosary of San Nicol√°s, Argentina, 2014 This period also saw the growth of lay Marian devotional organizations such as free rosary distribution groups. An example is Our Lady's Rosary Makers which was formed with a $25 donation for a typewriter in 1949 and now has thousands of volunteers who have distributed hundreds of millions of free rosaries to Catholic missions worldwide. During this period key Marian papal encyclicals and Apostolic Letters were issued and Pope Pius X and Pope Pius XII both took major steps in establishing new Marian dogmas. The encyclical Ad diem illum of Pope Pius X commemorated the fiftieth anniversary of the dogma of Immaculate Conception, and Pope Pius XII issued the Apostolic constitution Munificentissimus Deus to define ex cathedra the dogma of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary. More recently, Pope John Paul II's encyclical Redemptoris Mater took the step of addressing the role of the Virgin Mary as Mediatrix. The Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lichen in Stary Liche≈Ñ was constructed between 1994 and 2004. It is Poland's largest church, the seventh largest in Europe and eleventh in the World. It houses a 200-year-old painting known as the Our Lady of Sorrows, Queen of Poland. Begun in 1987 the Sanctuary dedicated to Our Lady of the Rosary of San Nicol√°s in Buenos Aires province, Argentina was inaugurated May 25, 2014. It houses an historical statue of Our Lady identified by private revelations to a lay woman of the diocese that occurred over a number of years, and were documented in a book by Fr. Rene Laurentin, and subsequently approved as \\"worthy of belief\\" by the local ordinary Bishop Cardella in May 2016.

Monk played a significant role in the abolition of slavery in British North America, when as Chief Justice he rendered a series of decisions regarding escaped slaves that 'while not technically abolishing slavery rendered it innocuous. The slave could not be compelled to serve longer than he would, and ... might leave his master at will.'https://archive.org/stream/slaveincanada00ridd/slaveincanada00ridd_djvu.txt Early life James Monk was born in 1745 at Boston, Massachusetts, and christened at King's Chapel. He was the son of Judge James Monk (1717-1768) of Halifax, Nova Scotia and his wife Ann, daughter of Henry Deering of Boston. Sir James Monk was a grandson of George Monk (b.1666) of Blatchingley, who was one of the three illegitimate sons of George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle. James was educated in Halifax where his father had settled in 1749. He studied law with his father from 1761 to 1767 and was admitted to the bar in 1768. After his father died leaving the family in debt, Monk took over the family's finances. In 1771, he studied law in London and on the recommendation of Lord Hillsborough he was appointed Solicitor-General of Nova Scotia in 1772, while continuing his law studies in London. In 1774, he married Ann Elizabeth Adams of St James's Street, London, who was said to be 'well connected'.http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&id;_nbr=3034 Dictionary of Canadian Biography Return to Halifax In September, 1774, Monk took up his position as Solicitor-General at Halifax. Enjoying the support of Lord Dartmouth, he quickly won the support of Governor Francis Legge and by December was acting Attorney-General in the place of William Nesbitt. In 1775, he was elected to the Nova Scotia House of Assembly for Yarmouth, but was unseated the following year for nonattendance. During the American Revolution he took an active part in anti-revolutionary activity in Nova Scotia. Career at Quebec Neither of Monk's posts were salaried, and as the executor of Governor Francis Legge's policies Monk was unpopular in with Nova Scotian officials. This led to George Germain, 1st Viscount Sackville, appointing Monk Attorney-General of Lower Canada in 1776. This move did not make things easier for Monk as Germain had placed him over Governor Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester's choice, William Grant, affecting the lucrative private practice that Carleton enjoyed with Quebec's merchants. Monk was kept out of Carleton's inner circle, but his friendship with Chief Justice Peter Livius led to his appointment in 1778 to Judge of the Vice-Admiralty Court, a position he held for ten years. Monk had avoided open conflict with Governor Carleton, but this did not last with Carleton's successor, Sir Frederick Haldimand who objected to Monk's opposition between policy and legality. Haldimand resurrected the dormant post of Solicitor-General to avoid having to call on Monk. In 1784, Monk lamented to his wife, \\"If I act with Law & Constitution legal & political I am to be . . . ruined by a Governor ‚Äì If I act against them I surely shall be ruined by Ministry who will screen their Gov\` under . . . my disgrace!\\" Ironically, in 1786 Monk was saved by Governor Carleton who had returned to succeed Haldimand. He now acted in a private capacity as the attorney to Quebec's merchants and forcefully opposed a bill, sponsored by the French Party, that had been passed by the Council for the Affairs of the Province of Quebec to extend the use of French civil law in the province, which in Lord Dorchester‚Äôs words was \\"granting by favor to one what they refused to another.\\" Career Monk served as solicitor general of Nova Scotia and was appointed attorney general of Quebec in 1776 serving until 1789 and then again from 1792 to 1794. In 1794 he was appointed Chief Justice of the King's Bench of Montreal. During his career Monk also served on Executive and Legislative Councils and Nova Scotia's Legislative Assembly. Monk was knighted in 1825 and in 1826, he would die at his home in Cheltenham, England at the age of 81. Monkland Avenue in Montreal is named for him. The Monk Metro Station and the Monk Boulevard are named for the Monk family, especially Frederick D. Monk, an attorney who along with Joseph-Ulric √âmard purchased land belonging to the Davidson family in order to develop it, the area became Ville √âmard.Monk Metro Namesakes The Monk Metro Station in Montreal is named for him, as is Monkland Avenue. The home he built in 1804, Monklands, still stands today as the central building of the Villa Maria School, Montreal. References Further reading * W.

Recording Longhaired Redneck was Coe's third album for Columbia in three years and the first where he wrote or co-wrote all the songs. Coe had already written several hits for other artists and scored his own Top 10 hit in 1975 with the Steve Goodman-John Prine composition ‚ÄúYou Never Even Called Me by My Name.‚Äù By 1976 the outlaw country movement was in full swing as artists such as Waylon Jennings and Willie Nelson were finally enjoying massive commercial success after years of fighting to record their music their own way. Coe, however, was still somewhat of an outsider, almost too outlaw for the outlaws, a predicament summed up well by Thom Jurek in his AllMusic review of the LP: The outlaw country zeitgeist was summed up well in the title track of Longhaired Redneck, which recounts playing in a dive ‚Äúwhere bikers stare at cowboys who are laughing at the hippies who are praying they'll get out of here alive.‚Äù The song, which has an unmistakable rock swagger, features Coe performing an impressive imitation of Ernest Tubb, making it irretrievably country as well, illustrating the dichotomy of what was being referred to as \\"progressive\\" country music. Coe later explained, ‚ÄúIt was terminology that I'd made up at the time. I was trying to tell people that not everybody with long hair was a hippie. Not everyone was the kind of person that thought you could punch them out, take their money and that they'd say, 'I won't do nothin' about it.'‚Äù The song is also an early example of Coe's penchant for namedropping, as he mentions Merle Haggard and proclaims ‚ÄúJohnny Cash helped me get out of prison.‚Äù Several of the songs, such as the prison lament ‚ÄúRevenge‚Äù and ‚ÄúLiving on the Run,‚Äù play up to the outlaw image, while ‚ÄúSpotlight‚Äù explores the lonely wasted existence of a country singer. (‚ÄúRoll me a smoke, give me some coke...‚Äù) and advises the press, ‚ÄúDon't waste your time or your flashbulbs, too many heroes are dead.‚Äù (In the same AllMusic review, Thom Jurek contends the song ‚Äúsums up the way he views his life at this particular juncture, and given the lyrics, his mind couldn't have been a nice place to live.‚Äù) Conversely, Longhaired Redneck also contains songs with warmer themes, such as ‚ÄúTexas Lullaby‚Äù (‚ÄúSee those tumbleweeds blowin‚Äô, Lord it makes me want to cry/It reminds me of my daddy and that Texas lullaby‚Äù) and ‚ÄúFamily Reunion,‚Äù which boasts multilayered harmonies and an allusion to the bluegrass classic \\"Fox on the Run\\". ‚ÄúFree Born Ramblin‚Äô Man‚Äù is a more obvious derivative paean to Southern rock, with its Allman Brothers-like guitar intro and title evoking that band's biggest hit. Coe is backed by The Nashville Edition and The Jordanaires on vocals, as well as some of Nashville's top session musicians such as Reggie Young and Charlie McCoy. Reception AllMusic praised the album, opining \\"Like most of Coe's '70s material, this one's essential outlaw country that stands the test of time,\\" but scorned the LP's closing track \\"Dakota the Dancing Bear, Part II,\\" as \\"an exercise in cynical, pointless counterculture idiocy and, unfortunately, was the first of Coe's 'novelty' songs.\\" Track listing All Songs written by David Allan Coe except where noted. #\\"Longhaired Redneck\\" (Coe, Jimmy Rabbitt) ‚Äì 3:24 #\\"When She's Got Me (Where She Wants Me)\\" ‚Äì 2:49 #\\"Revenge\\" (Coe, Jimmy Sadd) ‚Äì 2:33 #\\"Texas Lullaby\\" (Coe, Ann McGowan) ‚Äì 4:14 #\\"Living on the Run\\" (Coe, Jimmy L.

OutlookIndia.com. Accessed 30 May 2008. The PRC shares a contiguous border of 470 kilometers with Bhutan and its territorial disputes with Bhutan have been a source of potential conflict. Since the 1980s, the two governments have conducted regular talks on border and security issues aimed at reducing tensions.  Background  Bhutan has long had strong cultural, historical, religious and economic connections to Tibet. Relations with Tibet were strained when Chinese took over Tibet in 1950s. Unlike Tibet, Bhutan had no history of being under the suzerainty of China nor being under British suzerainty during the British Raj. Bhutan's border with Tibet has never been officially recognized, much less demarcated. The Republic of China officially maintains a territorial claim on parts of Bhutan to this day. The territorial claim was maintained by the People's Republic of China after the Chinese Communist Party took control of mainland China in the Chinese Civil War. With the increase in soldiers on the Chinese side of the Sino-Bhutanese border after the 17-point agreement between the Tibetan government and the central government of the PRC, Bhutan withdrew its representative from Lhasa. The 1959 Tibetan uprising and the 14th Dalai Lama's arrival in neighboring India made the security of Bhutan's border with China a necessity for Bhutan.

It was originally released on his fifth album, The River. The version released on The River was recorded at The Power Station in New York in January 1980.Brucebase, On The Tracks: The River An alternative version recorded in July 1979 was released on Tracks in 1998. History \\"Stolen Car\\" was written quickly and first recorded the day after \\"Hungry Heart. Music critic Clinton Heylin has suggested that it may have begun as a continuation of that song, as \\"Stolen Car\\" originally used similar language to explain the marriage failure: \\"We got married and promised never to part/Then I feel a victim to a hungry heart.\\" \\"Stolen Car,\\" along with a few other songs on The River including the title track and \\"Wreck on the Highway\\", mark a new direction in Bruce Springsteen's songwriting. These ballads, imbued with a sense of hopelessness, foreshadow his next album, Nebraska. Like \\"The River\\", \\"Stolen Car\\" is an inner-directed, psychological song that deals with a failing marriage. The protagonist of \\"Stolen Car\\" is driven by his loneliness to car theft, hoping to get caught but fearing to just disappear. Essentially, he wants to get arrested just to prove he exists. Author June Skinner Sawyers describes the theme of the song to be \\"the struggle to create meaning for oneself.\\" She notes that it \\"just tells a story, honestly and simply, offering one of Springsteen's most precise lyrics.\\" Patrick Humphries describes the effect as being similar to the Robert Mitchum film noir Build My Gallows High. The recording uses minimal backing, with soft piano and synthesizer punctuated by tympani-like drums. Springsteen's biographer Dave Marsh wrote that the recording fades away \\"without a nuance of reluctance. There is nothing more here‚Äîjust a waste of life and a man brave or stupid enough to watch it trickle away.\\" Bruce Springsteen himself has noted that \\"Stolen Car\\" is one of the songs reflecting a shift in his songwriting style, linking The River to Nebraska. He noted that the protagonist \\"felt disconnected and felt that he was fading away, disappearing, felt invisible,\\" just like Springsteen himself felt invisible while he was growing up. He has also stated that the protagonist was the character whose progress he would be following on the Tunnel of Love album, and that he served as the archetype for the male role in future songs Springsteen wrote about men and women. Springsteen would also develop themes from \\"Stolen Car\\" on other future songs, including \\"State Trooper\\" and \\"Highway Patrolman\\" from his 1982 Nebraska album and \\"Downbound Train\\" from his 1984 Born in the U.S.A. album. In 2015, Springsteen stated that he regards \\"Stolen Car,\\" \\"Point Blank,\\" \\"Independence Day\\" and the title track as being \\"the heart and soul\\" of The River album. \\"Stolen Car\\" and another song from The River, \\"Drive All Night\\", played a key role in setting the tone of the 1997 film Cop Land. It has been listed as one of the all-time great songs in Toby Creswell's \\"1001 songs\\" and as one of the 7500 most important songs from 1944 through 2000 by Bruce Pollock. Alternate version An alternate version of the song exists that was released on the album Tracks. This version, sometimes referred to as the \\"Son you may kiss the bride\\" version of the song,Graff, The Ties That Bind, 379-380. was recorded at The Power Station in July 1979.http://brucebase.wikidot.com/stats:The+River+-+Studio+Sessions Brucebase, On The Tracks: The River This version was originally intended to be released on a single album that was to be released in 1979 and called The Ties That Bind.Graff, The Ties That Bind, 304. This album was eventually scrapped and expanded to become the double album The River. In this process, \\"Stolen Car\\" was rerecorded in the version released on The River. The version of the song on Tracks has additional verses and the instrumentation is not as dark as in the version released on The River. In the final verse, the song's protagonist dreams of his wedding day and the joy and hope he felt but as he dreams of kissing his bride at the end of the ceremony he feels everything slip away again. A subtle difference between this version and The River version is that whereas on The River version the singer fears he will disappear into the night, in this version he already has, like a ghost. The lyrics of this version also include river imagery used in some other songs on The River, including the title track and \\"Hungry Heart\\". In this version of the song, the singer‚Äîor his ghost‚Äîsurrenders to the river similarly to the boy in the Flannery O'Connor story \\"The River,\\" whose \\"fury and fear left him\\" drowns the river he was intending to baptize himself in. Heylin referred to Springsteen replacing this version with the version released on The River as \\"an act of self-sabotage\\". Covers A cover version of \\"Stolen Car\\" was recorded by Patty Griffin for her 2002 album, 1000 Kisses.Graff, The Ties That Bind, 174. Another cover version was also recorded by Elliott Murphy.Graff, The Ties That Bind, 244. Owen recorded a slightly modified cover entitled \\"Stolen Bike\\" in 2006, released first on the Japanese edition of At Home with Owen. In 2018, X Ambassadors covered the song for Spotify.  In popular culture  The song, along with \\"Drive All Night\\", are played by the protagonist in the film Cop Land.

She earned the title Woman Grandmaster (WGM) at age 17 in 2007. Biography Nebolsina was raised near Tomsk in western Siberia, and her family currently resides in Novosibirsk. When only four years old, she learned the basic moves from her mother Tatiana, who introduced her to other board games too, such as draughts and Go. Inspired to develop her chess skills further, she was then coached by her father Valery, himself a chess master. By age six Nebolsina was playing in formal tournaments. Comfortably forging ahead of her peers, she regularly played in categories above her age group. This accelerated her progress and subsequent successes included winning the Russian Girls (under 8) Championship (at 7 years), and the World Youth Championship for Girls (under 10) in Oropesa del Mar 1998 (at 8 years). By the time she was twelve years old, Nebolsina was playing the Russian Women's 1st league‚Äîa high standard of competition. In 2004, she earned the title Woman International Master (WIM). There followed her most valuable victory to date, the World Junior Championship for Girls (under 20) at Yerevan in 2007 (at age 17). This result qualified her for the WGM title. Nebolsina's highest junior ranking was achieved in January 2008, when she was listed by FIDE as No. 13 among the world's top 20 girl players. Statistics for her recent games, however, specifically her record with the black pieces (+30% ‚àí42% =27%), show need for substantial improvement to match that of her closest rivals. Nebolsina describes herself as a who can also be a tactician. The sample game below ably demonstrates her alertness to tactical possibilities. Personal life Nebolsina is a vegetarian for ideological reasons. She is in her final year at Moscow State University, where she studies English and Chinese. She also speaks French. Notable games Although the following game is not without errors, Nebolsina's play shows the importance of piece over pawn moves, of which there are few. Despite spirited defence from her opponent, Nebolsina finds a pleasing queen sacrifice to conclude matters. :Vera Nebolsina‚ÄìIulia Gromova, Russian Team Championship, Sochi 2007; Caro‚ÄìKann, Panov‚ÄìBotvinnik Attack (B14) 1\\\\. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3. exd5 cxd5 4. c4 Nf6 5.

The literal meaning of forbearance is \\"holding back\\". When mortgage borrowers are unable to meet their repayment terms, lenders may opt to foreclose. To avoid foreclosure, the lender and the borrower can make an agreement called \\"forbearance.\\" According to this agreement, the lender delays its right to exercise foreclosure if the borrower can catch up to its payment schedule by a certain time. This period and the payment plan depend on the details of the agreement that is accepted by both parties. Historically, forbearance has been granted for customers in temporary or short-term financial difficulty. If the borrower has more serious problems, e. g. the return to full mortgage payments in the long term does not appear sustainable, then forbearance is usually not a solution. Each lender is likely to have its own suite of forbearance products. In response to COVID-19 government sponsored mortgage loans in the United States qualify for forbearance plans in compliance with the CARES Act. These plans are for borrowers impacted by COVID-19. Some common questions that arise include what are the consumers options at the end of the forbearance period and how will a forbearance agreement impact my credit. At the end of the forbearance period the consumer will be required to participate in a work out plan and the options include bringing the mortgage payments current, paying the loan in full, a mortgage modification plan, deferral of payments until the end of the loan or increased monthly payments to cure the arrearage. While it is difficult to predict your personal financial situation after the immediate crisis, it is important to note that a forbearance is not forgiveness and interest continues to accrue and if a final work out arrangement is not adopted foreclosure later down the line can be pursued by the lender. In addition it is important to note that these agreements do not block credit bureau reporting and the Government Sponsored Agencies (\\"GSE's) have provide guidance that the lender must report the mortgage status which will reflect the delinquency and past due payments. Types of forbearance Examples of the types of forbearance which lenders may potentially consider include: #A full moratorium on payments # Reduced payments: #* Above Interest- Only (termed Positive-Amortising) #* Below Interest-Only (Negative-Amortising) #*Interest Only # Reduced interest rate # Split Mortgage # Forbearance during COVID-19 more.. It needs to be understood that the type of forbearance being granted is being provided based on the customer's individual circumstances. For example, borrowers in short-term financial difficulty would be more likely to be approved of either a (short term) full moratorium or negative-amortising deal than customers in long-term financial difficulty, where the lender would at all times seek to ensure that the capital balance continues to be reduced (via an amortising forbearance arrangement). Negative-amortising forbearance arrangements are only suitable as short-term deals since failure to pay interest timely and/or on the whole loan balance is effectively is additional borrowing. It is important to note that depending on the parameters of the agreement consumers can be held fully responsible for paying the entire amount due after the duration of the forbearance. A lender who grants a forbearance is refraining from enforcing its right to realize interest on securities under their agreement or contract with the borrower. This is done to assist the borrower in returning to a performing financial position as well as better position the lender to realize its security should the borrower fail to perform. The borrower does not escape their debt obligations by accepting the agreed forbearance amount and/or terms. On expiry of the agreed forbearance period the loan account reverts to its original form. In many instances, upon expiration of the forbearance period, the difference between the level of forbearance granted and the full repayment (which was missed) is recalculated over the remaining term and the customer's new repayment is based on the current loan balance, rate and term. Some exceptions to this is where a reduced rate was given (where the possible intention here to reduce the capital balance as quickly as possible, thereby reducing the loan to value) or where the type of forbearance is for the lifetime of the loan, i.e. a split loan where 1 part of the loan is parked until the expiry date, with the intention that at that time a suitable repayment vehicle (say, sale of asset) is in place for the repayment of the loan in full. The GSE's released payment policies in April 2020 that clarified the terms of the COVID-19 forbearance plans. The announcement clarified that while full payment of arrears was an option to reinstate consumers are never required to choose a lump sum option. It reiterated the four options of full repayment, a repayment plan over time, a deferral to move the payments to the end of the loan, or a modification of the loan for more permanent hardships. The guidance specified owners facing hardships would start with shorter duration plans but those could be extended up to 12 months if necessary after reassessing the consumers financial hardship. The GSE's are also waiving late fees and suspending foreclosure sales and evictions until May 17, 2020. If you are facing financial hardship, you need to communicate with your mortgage servicing company. The COVID -19 policy requires the lenders to make contact with the consumer to obtain specifics of the scenario and to perform an assessment of the hardship and ability to repay. During these conversations, be sure to explore the long term work out options available after the forbearance period expires. Verbal conversations should be validated and documented through email correspondence and written agreements as applicable. The term 'forbearance' is addressed by different names in different countries. The norms of a foreclosure agreement also vary. For example, in Australia, banks offer 'hardship variation' to borrowers struggling financially. Borrowers can ask their lenders to make changes to the terms of their loans. Borrowers can either opt for a short-term relief by having their mortgage payment suspended for a short period of time (known as forbearance in the U.S.), or they can apply for reduced payments over the life of the loan's term (known as loan modification in the U.S.). Lenders are required to give a particular reason as to why an application for hardship variation was being turned down by them. Borrowers are encouraged to talk to their internal complaints section of their respective bank or file a dispute. In Spain, banks mostly allow temporary interest-only payments, rather than suspending the full amount of installment altogether. The Bank of Spain (Banco de Espa√±a) ‚Äì the country's de facto bank ‚Äì discourages banks from keeping mortgages in arrears. For that reason, banks are not required to offer any relief to borrowers. Banks can repossess properties without agreeing to changes in terms of the loan that might help a customer.

It carries local news as well as syndicated content from Associated Press and others.  History  Alamogordo Daily News claims 1898 as its founding date, but a case can be made for 1896. A predecessor, the Chief, was founded in Tularosa as a weekly in 1896, then moved to La Luz the next year and changed its name to Sacramento Chief. It was sold to the Alamogordo Printing Company in 1899 and continued under the same name briefly before becoming the Alamogordo News. The paper continued as a weekly until the 1950s when it went daily. The paper has been sold several times. Recently it was sold by Community Newspaper Holdings to MediaNews Group in 2001. The paper is part of the Texas-New Mexico Newspapers Partnership, a joint venture formed in 2003 between MediaNews Group and Gannett, with MediaNews Group the managing partner. The paper was an evening paper until September 1, 2006, published weekday evenings and Sunday mornings. It then switched to a morning paper, published daily except Mondays. In 2015, Gannett acquired full ownership of the Texas-New Mexico Newspapers Partnership.Gannett acquires complete ownership of Texas-New Mexico Newspaper Partnership from Digital First Media The paper regularly wins awards from the New Mexico Press Association and from the New Mexico Associated Press Managing Editors.  Features   Coverage  Alamogordo Daily News is primarily a local newspaper. It has a staff of reporters and news editor to write local news. It also carries state, local, and national news from the Associated Press. It covers the city of Alamogordo and the neighboring village of Tularosa. The other incorporated area in Otero County, Cloudcroft, has its own newspaper, the Mountain Monthly, and does not get much coverage in this paper. The paper publishes and shares some content with a free weekly tabloid, Hollogram, at nearby Holloman Air Force Base covering happenings on base.  Major sections  The paper is published in two sections: * A: local news; weather; an Opinion page; an extensive listing of coming events * B: sports; state, national, and international news (sometimes split with section A); comics; classified ads There are several weekly editorial inserts (in addition to advertising inserts): * Wednesday: As Seen on TV, a locally produced tabloid based on content from zip2it.com; complete TV listings and some feature stories * Thursday: American Profile, a national rotogravure magazine published by Publishing Group of America * Friday: V√°monos, an arts, entertainment, and dining tabloid covering Otero and Lincoln Counties; published by and appearing in Alamogordo Daily News and in Ruidoso News * Sunday: USA Weekend, a national rotogravure magazine published by Gannett The Opinion page combines editorials, editorial cartoons, op-ed pieces, letters to the editor, and occasionally short feature articles written by community members.  Recurring features  There are full-page sections of photos and press releases that appear once or twice a week: * \\"¬øQu√© Pasa?\\" features upcoming or just-passed local events * \\"Celebrate\\" features wedding announcements, anniversaries, promotions, etc. * \\"Kudos\\" covers awards and other notable achievements There are regular columns on gardening, on Alamogordo Public Schools, on Alamogordo Public Library, on animals in the Alameda Park Zoo, and on Otero County Community Health Council. \\"New Mexico Tally\\", a roll call from Thomas Voting Reports of how New Mexico's Congressional delegation voted on the most important bills, appears each Saturday.  Web site  The paper's web site carries all the locally- written editorial content. It is updated once or twice daily with breaking news stories that will appear in tomorrow's print edition. There is also an official newspaper blog.  Editorial position  Alamogordo Daily News rarely prints unsigned editorials or expresses an official editorial position. The few it publishes usually deal with endorsements for an election. For example, in the March 2008 municipal election it endorsed a candidate in the only contested City Commission race and endorsed a bond issue for street maintenance. In 2006 it made endorsements for all races in the November general election. The paper runs a lead editorial in each issue, but they are nearly all reprinted from other newspapers, particularly other MediaNews Group papers. There is no editorial cartoonist, but each issue carries an editorial cartoon from the Copley News Service. The syndicated columnist Jay Miller from Santa Fe appears frequently with his \\"Inside the Capitol\\" column about New Mexico politics. Newspaper staffers occasionally write signed opinion pieces, and while these are not official positions they are featured prominently on the Opinion page. For example, in 2007 there was a contentious bill before the State Legislature to prohibit smoking in most indoor public places and work places. The paper did not take a position on this, but it published signed opinion pieces against the bill by the Assistant Editor and for the bill by the Publisher.

This grouping of birds has been supported in a variety of recent studies. There are two higher classification schemes that have been proposed for the apodimorph families. One is all strisorean birds are classified in the order Caprimulgiformes, while the other is the strisorean birds are split into several distinct orders. In this case Apodimorphae is a subclade of Strisores that includes the orders Aegotheliformes (only including the owlet-nightjars of Austrailasia) and the Apodiformes (the swifts, treeswifts, and hummingbirds which have a global distribution). A similar name for the group Daedalornithes has been used for the owlet-night-apodiform clade, there is a difference between the two names with Apodimorphae defined as the total-group (the most inclusive clade including Aegotheles cristatus and Apus apus but not Caprimulgus europaeus, Steatornis caripensis, Nyctibius grandis, or Podargus strigoides) and Daedalornithes defined as the crowned group (the least inclusive clade including Aegotheles cristatus and Apus apus).

The 114th is equipped with the F-15C Eagle. History World War II The squadron was first activated in mid-1942 as the 439th Bombardment Squadron, a B-26 Marauder medium bombardment unit. It trained under Third Air Force in Louisiana. The unit was reassigned to the European Theater of Operations (ETO), being assigned initially to VIII Air Support Command in England in September 1942. The 439th flew several missions over France and Belgium from its base in England during October, then was reassigned to the new Twelfth Air Force in Algeria. During the North African Campaign, the squadron engaged in tactical bomb strikes of enemy targets, primarily in eastern Algeria and Tunisia, including railroads, airfields, harbor installations, and enemy shipping along the Mediterranean Coast. The squadron returned to French Morocco in March 1943, then returned to combat in June 1943, attacking enemy targets on Italian islands in the Mediterranean, including Sicily, Sardinia, and Pantelleria. From bases in Algeria and Tunisia, the unit supported the Allied invasion of Italy, bombing bridges and marshalling yards during the late summer and early autumn of 1943. In November, it moved to Sardinia, to strike Axis targets in central Italy. Early in 1944, the squadron supported Allied ground forces as they advanced in the Cassino and Anzio areas. Later in the year, the group attacked German supply lines in northern Italy, bombing bridges, marshalling yards, and roads. During the summer, it bombed bridges over the Po River in northern Italy to block the stream of German supplies and reinforcements going southward. The unit supported the invasion of southern France in August 1944 by attacking coastal batteries, radar stations, and bridges. From Corsica, it hit railroad bridges in Northern Italy and late in the year attacked railroad lines through the Brenner Pass that connected Germany and Austria with Italy. In January 1945, the squadron returned to the United States, where it began to train with A-26 aircraft for operations in the Pacific Theater of Operations. Between May and July 1945, it moved by ship to Okinawa, and on 16 July the squadron flew its first mission against Japan. From then until the end of the fighting in early August, the squadron attacked enemy targets such as airfields and industrial centers on Ky≈´sh≈´ and the occupied Shanghai area of China, and shipping around the Ryukyu Islands and in the East China Sea. In November and December 1945 the squadron returned to the United States and was inactivated. New York Air National Guard The squadron was initially allotted to the Oregon Air National Guard on 24 May 1946 and redesignated the 114th Bombardment Squadron, Light. It was transferred to the New York National Guard and received federal recognition on 26 June 1946 The 114th Bombardment Squadron was equipped with B-26 Invader light bombers and assigned to the 106th Bombardment Group at Floyd Bennett Field, Brooklyn. 114th Tactical Fighter Training Squadron F-4C Phantom II, AF Ser. No. 63-7581, about 1985 When the Korean War broke out in June 1950, the entire 106th Bombardment Group was federalized and brought to active duty. The group was moved to March Air Force Base, California and assigned to Fifteenth Air Force of Strategic Air Command (SAC). It was assigned B-29 Superfortress medium bombers, and the mission of the 106th Bomb Group was the training of reservists to backfill rotating B-29 combat crews serving on Okinawa. The Group served with SAC until returning to New York state control on 1 December 1952. Upon return to Floyd Bennett Field, the 114th again was equipped with B-26s and resumed training with its light bombers and flew them until its conversion to an air defense fighter unit in 1956. Under Air Defense Command, the 106th Fighter-Interceptor Group initially received Lockheed F-94A Starfires and in 1957 the North American F-86D Sabre Interceptor. The State of New York was notified by Headquarters, United States Air Force on 26 September 1957 that support for the 114th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron would be ended due to fiscal constraints. Despite protests from the Governor of New York State that this was in violation of the law with respect to State militia units, the Air Force eventually prevailed and the 114th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron was inactivated on 30 September 1958. Oregon Air National Guard 114th Fighter Squadron Block 15 ADF F-16A formation about 1990. The 8123d Fighter-Interceptor Training Squadron was organized by the Oregon Air National Guard at Kingsley Field, Oregon in January 1983 as an F-4C Phantom II Formal Training Unit for the interceptor pilots of the 123d Fighter-Interceptor Squadron at Portland International Airport. On 1 October 1983 the unit was organized and federally recognized by the National Guard Bureau as the 114th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, with the 114th designation being transferred back to the Oregon Air National Guard. With the phaseout of the F-4C from the inventory in the late 1980s, the 114th was re-equipped with the F-16A/B block 15 Air Defense Fighter and continued its mission as a Formal Training Unit. On 1 April 1996, the 173d Fighter Wing was formed at Kingsley AGB as a host organization and parent unit for the 114th Fighter Squadron when the unit was authorized to expand, with the 114th being transferred from the 142d Fighter Wing at Portland to the new Wing at Kingsley ANGB. Along with the 114th FS, the 173d consists of the 173d Operations Group; 173d Maintenance Group, 173d Mission Support Group and 173d Medical Group. With the 123d Fighter Squadron flying F-15 Eagles, the F-16As were retired in the late 1990s as their service life was ending. The squadron began receiving F-15A/B Eagles in 1998. Was upgraded to the F-15C/D Eagle in 2004, continuing its mission as an ANG interceptor training unit.

He was a cousin of Walker Forward, Treasury Secretary to William Henry Harrison. Though his father had fought in the War of 1812, circa 1816 the family moved to Canada. While in Canada, he studied law, but was banished from Canada for participating in the Rebellions of 1837. He then returned to New York. He was befriended by Congressman Isaac H. Bronson, and moved to Florida at his behest. Forward moved to St. Augustine, where he opened a legal practice and entered politics as a Democrat. Widowed in 1841, Forward then remarried on June 9, 1842, to Mary Hutchinson, daughter of a New York attorney and granddaughter of a Dartmouth College president. He embraced planter life and is known to have owned slaves in 1850. Like many in East Florida, Forward resisted statehood for Florida and supported the division of Florida, contrary to the sentiments of most Democrats at the time. In 1844, St. Johns County elected him to the Florida Territorial Legislature, and in January 1845 became its Speaker. After statehood he left office, but was elected to the State Senate to replace Senator George Center after his resignation adjourned session in November 1845. He chaired the judiciary committee. He returned to the House in 1847 and was reelected to the Senate in 1848, a Democrat in a Whig controlled legislature. As a legislator, he was opposed to the popular election of circuit judges, but supported popular election of probate judges. He also supported granting defendants greater rights to appeal. In 1850, the Democrats held a majority and he became chair of the Corporations Committee. He continued to oppose popular election of circuit judges. His proposal that judges be appointed by the governor with confirmation by the Senate was not adopted. His bid to become a judge was not successful in 1850. But he defeated incumbent Thomas Douglas in 1853 to become Circuit Judge for East Florida. In 1851 he opened a practice with former Comptroller Simon Towle in Tallahassee. He left the bench four years later, and entered into private practice with John P. Sanderson. Forward moved to Palatka, where he became a charter member of the First Presbyterian Church.

The Alberta Council on Admissions and Transfer (ACAT) was established in 1974 to guide the transfer of academic credit among provincial post-secondary institutions. In 1975, the Conservative government acknowledged the linkage between education and employment by transferring the Manpower Division from Manpower and Labour to the Department of Advanced Education and Manpower. This arrangement existed until 1983, when the manpower portfolio was again separated from Advanced Education. A series of new funding policies were introduced in 1973 and 1976. These new funding mechanisms took into account factors such as the projection of operational costs over a three-year period and the rate of inflation to determine the allocation of resources for a growing number of institutions. Increasing institutional competition and financial restructuring (1980s - 1990s) Aerial photo of the University of Calgary In the 1980s, community colleges began to receive funds in order to establish their own apprenticeship training programs. Prior to this, these programs were centralized in technical institutes. As technical institutes lost their exclusive control over apprenticeship programs, they gained increased autonomy when Bill 98, the Technical Institutes Act, was approved in 1982, transferring their governance from the provincial government to their own board of governors. In the financial front, the 1980s are marked by the introduction of a Supplementary Enrollment Fund for Post-Secondary funding in 1982, which factored in enrollment increases to allocate provincial financial resources. The 1990s saw Alberta's post-secondary system change in terms of significant financial restructuring imposed by the provincial government, and the introduction of a new and targeted funding model that emphasizes accountability and demonstration of results.Burger, J., Bolender, M.

On March 17, 2004, the Post-Secondary Learning Act was proclaimed, amalgamating the former Universities Act, Colleges Act, Banff Centre Act and Technical Institutes Act into a single piece of legislation.Post-Secondary Learning Act, Chapter P‚Äë19.5. Retrieved on July 27, 2008 from http://www.qp.gov.ab.ca/documents/Acts/P19P5.cfm The booming Alberta economy led to significant investments in post-secondary institutions and policies. A series of new scholarships were introduced for all newborns in the province, and the existing Rutherford scholarships were expended. There were also heavy capital investments, with almost all the main campuses receiving funds for expansions, renovations, and upgrades. A new interest in P3 funding also fuelled this expansion. Many of the new facilities and faculty have made the University of Alberta one of the world's top research institutions, and boast the second-largest student body in Canada as of September, 2009. In September, 2009, Calgary's Mount Royal University and Edmonton's Grant MacEwan University became the province's fifth and sixth public universities, respectively. Formerly considered colleges, both institutions offer many of the degrees and facilities previously only available at the two larger universities. Despite recent high provincial spending, tuition costs remain a concern for many Alberta students. Many promised cuts have yet to be realized, and costs are expected to rise again in the 2010s. The recent worldwide economic downturn has also brought a huge number of unemployed people back to school, putting further pressures on the institutions. Access Geographical Post- Secondary institutions in Alberta have been established in response to geographic population growth. In the beginning, there was only one university in the province, but satellite campuses were established as the population in other parts of the province grew. Later, these satellite campuses became universities that met the educational needs of the province's growing urban centres. In the 1960s, colleges sprouted, enabling access to higher education in rural areas. Transferability Improving access is done not only through geography expansion but also by increasing transferability or articulation of courses and programs between post-secondary institutions. Historically, students completed programs at a single institution. However, over time students have become increasingly mobile, attending more than one post-secondary institution throughout the course of their academic lives. The province has supported and encouraged this kind of student mobility by developing college programs that transfer to larger urban post-secondary institutions where degrees can be completed. Initially articulation between the post-secondary institutions was conducted on a course by course basis. This approach proved to be laborious and inconsistent. As a result, Alberta post-secondary institutions and the provincial government collaborated to establish the Alberta Council on Admissions and Transfer (ACAT) in 1974. Through ACAT, post-secondary stakeholders work cooperatively to ensure a smooth transition and transferability of courses and programs within the post- secondary system. ACAT also promotes assessment and recognition of prior learning assessment to recognize experiences outside of formal course requirements. West view of Rutherford House on the grounds of the University of Alberta, Edmonton Through ACAT various types of transfer agreements exist. In program articulation, students in colleges and technical institutes' programs can transfer to the first or second year of another institution's program. Depending on whether the student is transferring after accumulating one year credits or two years credits, it is called a \\"one plus one\\" or \\"two plus two\\" transfer.Barrington Research Group, Inc (2005) Best Practices in Prior Learning Assessment Recognition (PLAR) Final Report Retrieved May 11, 2008, from http://www.acat.gov.ab.ca/pdfs/PLAR_Final_Report_May_11_2005.pdf Credit transfer between institutions considers transferability at an individual course level. In some cases, a course may be considered the same at the sending institution as it is at the receiving institution (the course is a transfer course). In other cases, a course is considered sufficiently similar or meets discipline requirements even though there is not an equivalent course at the receiving institution (the course is considered transferable). In addition to covering Alberta institutions, Aurora College in Northwest Territories, and Nunavut Arctic College in Nunavut are covered by ACAT. In 2007, ACAT and the British Columbia Council on Admissions and Transfer agreed to a protocol regarding transfers between Alberta and British Columbia. The purpose of the protocol is to ensure that any student who satisfactorily completes course work in either Alberta or British Columbia, and wishes to transfer to an institution in the other may do so. This protocol is \\"in lieu of formal articulation because it is unlikely that the volume of students transferring to institutions in the other province will justify the resources necessary to undertake a formal articulation on a course-to-course basis.\\" Prior Learning Assessment and Recognition - PLAR Many Alberta post- secondary programs have Prior Learning Assessment and Recognition (PLAR). PLAR recognizes learning can be obtained through means other than formal credit courses. PLAR was in place prior to the change in the post-secondary act and is available in a wide variety of courses and programs. It continues to be a factor that aids in making post-secondary options accessible. ApplyAlberta In 2005, Alberta created a single online application system for 21 publicly funded post-secondary institutions called ApplyAlberta. By 2008 all 26 publicly funded post-secondary institutions were participating. The initiative serves two purposes: to facilitate entry into the post- secondary system for students, and to track the number of qualified applications, withdrawals, and other data to improve departmental planning. eCampusAlberta eCampusAlberta was a partnership of the 26 Alberta publicly funded post-secondary institutions that facilitated increased access to high quality online learning opportunities. The partnership allowed Alberta students living anywhere in the province to receive post-secondary education from any of the partnership's member institutions. Students could use the eCampusAlberta website to learn about and register in courses and programs and to choose their lead and partner institutions. eCampusAlberta ceased operation in March 2017; the impact on distance education enrollment is being assessed. Dual Credit Policy In May 2013, the Albertan Progressive Conservative Party released a document commissioned by Alison Redford, Premier at the time, entitled Provincial Dual Credit Strategy: Call to Action. This short policy detailed the party's vision for dual credit opportunities as they related to high school students transitioning to higher education on a career path, and included two phases: \\"From Vision to Action\\" and \\"From Implementation to Sustainability\\". Redford committed $11 million over three years to fund the development of this plan. Between 2008 and 2011, the Alberta government funded dual credit pilot projects while, at the same time, individual school jurisdictions and post-secondary institutions negotiated separate non- government funded dual credit agreements. Through these dual credit opportunities, high school students participated in apprenticeship training and/or post-secondary, college or university courses while earning both high school and post-secondary credits for the same course. The Dual Credit Strategy calls for an expansion of the network of partnerships between the government (school jurisdictions) and higher-education institutions, and provides an evolving database to a list of courses called \\"pathways\\" organized based on emerging with a particular designation or certification in the job market. A pathway is defined as \\"a selection of courses providing students with opportunities to explore and acquire the attitudes, skills, knowledge, and values for a potential career.\\" Comprehensive Community Institutions, which focus on trade certification, and technical/vocational studies, make up the majority of the partnerships. As of June 2015, there are 60 pathways available to students. The target students of this legislation, although available to all Albertan students, are explicitly listed as First Nations, M√©tis and Inuit students, those living in remote or rural communities, and students who are at risk of dropping out of high school. Future challenges and improving access Changing demographics in Alberta are likely to have a profound effect on post-secondary education. The majority of the population growth in Alberta is its urban centres - Edmonton, Calgary, Red Deer and Lethbridge - while the proportion of people living in small towns and rural areas is declining. Institutions based in rural communities will likely have challenges meeting enrollment targets while institutions in urban centres will face pressure in having enough capacity. Meanwhile, although the number of people immigrating to Alberta has been increasing, persistent gaps between immigrant and non-immigrant Albertans' success in the labor market will impact the province's ability to attract and retain highly skilled individuals. Therefore, addressing the most challenging labor market barriers for new Canadians‚Äîthe lack of Canadian work experience, the lack of recognition for foreign credentials, and language barriers‚Äîwould support new Albertans and the province in meeting its current and future demographic, labour, and skill needs.Government of Alberta.

Retrieved from http://www.advancededucation.gov.ab.ca/post-secondary/policy/capr.aspx With their Business Plan priorities, the Ministry of Advanced Education indicates that it is committed to increasing access to learning opportunities. One of their focuses is to target under-represented groups in post-secondary, most notably First Nations, Metis and Inuit learners. The Access Advisory Council is a body appointed by the Ministry of Advance Education and Technology to provide advice in relation to the operation and reporting of the Access to the Future Fund. Finally, the impact of dropping oil prices on the Alberta economy in spring 2015 will have significant impacts on Albertans' need to access higher education. Workers may need to return to the classroom to upgrade their skills to remain competitive in a weaker economy. Access to education at all levels remains a priority for Alberta as the province continues to invest in developing a strong knowledge-based economy rather than its historic heavy reliance on the natural resource industry. Structure Public post- secondary institutional structure St. Joseph's College at the University of Alberta University of Calgary Alberta's public post-secondary system is organized into six categories or institutional designations. Collectively, these institutions offer a comprehensive set of certificates, diplomas, applied degrees, bachelors, masters and doctoral programs. Each public post- secondary institution has a mandate outlining the institution's direction in terms of programming, region and client group served. An institution's mandate is one of the guidelines used when new credit programs are considered for approval by the Ministry of Advanced Education. In 2007, the Ministry of Advanced Education developed a model that defines institutions according to their credentials, type and intensity of research activity, and geographic focus. The six categories or institutional designations are: * 1. Comprehensive Academic and Research Institutions (Athabasca University, University of Alberta, University of Calgary, University of Lethbridge) * 2. Baccalaureate and Applied Studies Institutions (MacEwan University, Mount Royal University) * 3. Polytechnic Institutions (e.g., NAIT, SAIT Polytechnic) * 4. Comprehensive Community Institutions (e.g., Bow Valley College, Keyano College, Lakeland College, Red Deer College) * 5. Independent Academic Institutions (e.g., Ambrose University College, The King's University College) * 6. Specialized Arts and Culture Institutions (e.g., Alberta College of Art and Design, The Banff Centre) Research structure When Alberta established its six sector advanced education system in 2007, it also clearly defined roles and responsibilities for three categories of research: pure, applied, and scholarly. Pure research is defined as exploratory and primarily conducted by Comprehensive Academic and Research Institutions (CARI). Applied research focuses on identification of solutions to specific areas, may involve third party engagement or funding, and is conducted by non- CARIs. Lastly, scholarly research encourages faculty members at non-CARIs to engage in research that supplements their instructional mandate, possibly in collaboration with a CARI. With the clarity of roles established in the post- secondary system, Alberta's universities, colleges and technical institutes focus their mandates to contribute to the overall success of Alberta's research and innovation system. Provincial higher education research falls under the banner of Alberta Innovates. Provincial legislation Alberta has produced various acts to deal with post-secondary education over the course of its history. These acts were passed to regulate the development of different types of educational institutions established over time (see chronology). Most recently, the Ministry of Advanced Education proclaimed the Post-secondary Learning Act in 2004. This act is now the singular piece of legislation that takes the place of four previous acts (the universities, colleges, Banff Centre and technical institutes acts). The rationale for combining all these acts is to establish a framework to expand offerings of baccalaureate degrees beyond the universities and private degree granting university colleges. Public colleges and institutes under this act can grant degrees as well. Another reason for this move is: to promote better coordination between public post-secondary institutions; avoid duplication of functions; move toward a single seamless post-secondary system; and ensure efficient allocation of resources. The creation of Campus Alberta Quality Council as the body that examines proposals for new degrees is also part of the consolidated Post-secondary Learning Act. =Campus Alberta= In 2002, Alberta Learning released Campus Alberta, a document about the province's post-secondary system. Campus Alberta contains a set of guiding principles intended on fostering high quality, flexible learning opportunities for Alberta citizens. This document triggered changes in the post-secondary system, particularly to the acts that governed the different educational institutions. Although the concept has since evolved, this document set parameters around the emerging notion of lifelong learning. The key factors that encourage lifelong learning are: * A global tendency towards a knowledge- based economy * Globalization of international markets and growing competitive pressures * Industry's need for an increasingly sophisticated and expanding workforce * The positive impact education has on the individual and society at large. Campus Alberta advocates for a learning system that is responsive and focused on the learner as well as innovative, collaborative, and accessible. In terms of accessibility and collaboration, the report recognizes the importance of both formal and informal learning opportunities as a way of earning credits for post-secondary education and encourages more articulation between post-secondary entities.Alberta Learning.(2002).Campus Alberta: A Policy Framework. Retrieved May 11, 2008 from http://www.advancededucation.gov.ab.ca/pubstats/CampusPolicy/CampusAlbertFramework.pdf Now, the Campus Alberta Planning Resource has become an annual profile of Alberta's advanced education system, published by Alberta Advanced Education and Technology. The latest Campus Alberta Planning Resource was published in 2014. It provides a common source for data on demographics, enrollment, and economic factors that impact demand for post-secondary education and the capacity of post-secondary institutions to meet this demand. This helps to ensure that Campus Alberta can respond to the needs of learners, the economy, and society in all regions across the province. Governance Ministry of Advanced Education The public post-secondary system is overseen by the Ministry of Advanced Education. The ministry's role is to provide oversight and leadership, facilitate partnerships, and work with post-secondary stakeholders. Credit programs are approved and administered by Alberta Innovation and Advanced Education. The Ministry of Advanced Education does not act in isolation but has a number of councils and boards to provide policies and guidelines. These include: *Alberta Council on Admissions and Transfer *Alberta Apprenticeship and Industry Training Board *Alberta Post-Secondary Application System *Campus Alberta Quality Council Public post-secondary institutions Public post-secondary institutions in Alberta have a bicameral governance structure. According to the Post-secondary Learning Act, each institution is governed by an autonomous Board of Governors. This entity provides strategic direction, establishes program offerings, approves admissions requirements, and promotes the development of the communities served by the institution.Alberta's Queen Print (2008) Post-secondary Learning Act. Retrieved May 17, 2008 from http://www.qp.alberta.ca/574.cfm?page=p19p5.cfm‚ãö_type=Acts&isbncln;=9780779743278 In addition to the Board of Governors, colleges and technical institutes have academic councils that make recommendations to and reports for the Board of Governors in academic policy matters, such as election and admission of students; review and provision of courses and programs of instruction; and academic awards. Universities in Alberta each have a senate whose main duty is to inquire into any matters that might benefit the university and enhance its position in the community. The senate also deals with academic matters. Reports on various matters are provided to the senate by the academic councils defined by the current legislation: a) General Faculties Council; b) Deans' Council; and c) Faculty and School Councils. The senate also requires reports from entities representing the student body such as the Council of Students Association and the Council of Graduate Students Association. Funding The Students' Union (SU) building at the University of Lethbridge in Lethbridge, Alberta Responsibility and sources The provincial government of Alberta provides monetary support to 26 post-secondary institutions. (See section: Publicly Funded Post-secondary Institutions) Although Alberta Advanced Education provides the majority of funding, post-secondary institutions raise additional funds by generating tuition and student fees; offering fee-based services; and offering non-credit and off-campus credit programming. A third source of funding comes from donations, sponsored research funding from provincial and federal agencies and private industry, and investments. In principle the funding of post-secondary education in Alberta is a responsibility shared by students, their families and society. In a context of rising student costs, the Alberta government has set in place policies in areas such as tuition fees and financial assistance to ensure adequate levels of access and affordability. Tuition fee policy In order to ensure a reasonable contribution by the students to the costs of post-secondary education, the Alberta government regulates the payment of tuition fees. The tuition fee policy introduced in 1990 and amended in 1995 ensures that this direct monetary contribution does not exceed 30% of the cost of their education. This policy requires public post-secondary institutions to charge the same fee to all residents of Canada and to impose a surcharge of 100% to all foreign students. Although students now contribute proportionately more toward the costs of their post-secondary education than they did in 1994‚Äì95, societal contributions have also increased. Financial assistance Alberta's student loan program is structured on the shared-cost principle. Loans are awarded on the basis of student need and parental contributions. Society contributes through loan forgiveness and servicing costs. Alberta's student financial assistance program has increased student loan levels as well as the number and value of non-repayable forms of financial assistance in a context marked by the rising cost of post-secondary education. =Alberta Centennial Education Savings Plan= In 2005 the Alberta Centennial Education Savings Plan (ACES) was created. This program aims to encourage parents to plan early for their children's future post-secondary education needs. ACES pays $500 into a Registered Education Savings Plan for any child born to or adopted by Alberta residents starting 1 January 2005. Additional $100 grants are available at ages 8, 11, and 14 to children enrolled in school, provided at least $100 has been contributed during the previous year. Research funding The Ministry of Advanced Education supports the research function of universities through base operations grants and envelope funding that finance the overall infrastructure required for research in the province. The research infrastructure includes not only physical resources, such as facilities and equipment, but also human resources, such as faculty and graduate students. In addition to the aforementioned mechanisms, a specific type of activity called sponsored research is supported externally by: a) federal research granting councils, b) non-profit, and c) industry sources. However, a significant proportion of this research is sponsored by provincial government sources as well. The allocation of resources for sponsored research is based on the experts' assessment of the qualities and potential of a particular project.

It was not until 1825 that the first official legislation was passed by the local assembly to foster higher education. The Act for the Encouragement of Education in the Different Counties and Districts of the Island was the first of a series of education acts developed to establish a Government-supported public university.Olga, Sister M.

Reverend Charles Lloyd, an Anglican minister, was appointed Principal when the first class commenced in 1836. In 1860, the Academy was renamed Prince of Wales College in honour of a visit of the future King Edward VII. With the opening of the Central Academy and St. Andrew's College, the island had two government-supported institutions of higher education firmly established in the region.Government of Prince Edward Island.

Retrieved May 20, 2008, from http://www.gov.pe.ca/200years/ The Free Education Act passed in 1852 was in response for a desire of providing free education. The significance of this act was that it was not only the forerunner of establishing school districts, but that it also established that the Colonial government would pay the salaries of teachers. At the time of its enactment, it enabled greater access to free education than was available in Britain. In 1854, Saint Dunstan's University (SDU) was founded by the Roman Catholic diocese of Charlottetown as a seminary, but by the mid-20th century had expanded into a small liberal arts university. From 1890 to 1917, SDU had partnered with Laval University in Quebec and awarded joint degrees. This partnership remained intact until 1956 despite SDU receiving a degree-granting charter of its own from the provincial legislature in 1917; however, it did not award its first bachelor's degrees until the spring 1941 convocation. At the Charlottetown Conference in 1864, representatives from the British North America colonies - Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and the Province of Canada - gathered to discuss Confederation. In 1867, the British North America Act, 1867 was passed by the British government and then given the Queen's assent. It established Confederation and outlined division of responsibility between the provincial and federal governments in several areas, including education. Prince Edward Island entered confederation on July 1, 1873 and joined the Dominion of Canada.Library and Archives Canada. (n.d.). Canadian Confederation ‚Äì Prince Edward Island..

At the time, this was an unprecedented level of funding and considered far more advanced than even Great Britain. With a growing population, a need to expand agricultural education was soon felt to reduce the reliance on imported food. In 1905, wealthy philanthropist Sir William Macdonald, responded to this call for educational reform by sponsoring schools that focused on applied training; Macdonald Consolidated Schools were opened in Nova Scotia, Ontario and New Brunswick in 1903 and in 1905 at Mt. Herbert, Prince Edward Island. Unrest in Europe would soon affect the new Dominion of Canada. When Great Britain declared war on Germany in 1914, Canada was automatically included as its foreign affairs were still controlled by the British Government. Besides the obvious loss of university-aged young men to fighting, economically it was crippling as income tax was introduced as a \\"temporary measure\\" to help pay for the war effort. As a post-war rehabilitation measure, the Dominion Government agreed to provide $10,000,000 in support of technical education in an effort to bolster the economy of the country. In PEI, the focus was still on agrarian needs and the Prince Edward Island Agricultural and Technical School was opened in 1920. The school was short-lived as it ceased operation in 1925. After the collapse of the western economies in the 1930s, there was little money available to support postsecondary education as Canada was also thrown into severe economic depression. Canada committed to supporting Great Britain in World War II and by the time Germany surrendered in 1945, approximately ten percent of the eleven million Canadians had served in the armed forces, and of those, 45,000 had been killed. There was a recognition that many more skilled workers were needed. 1960s to the present The provincial government began to acknowledge the serious shortage of skilled workers by the 1960s and financial support for vocational and technical education; as a result, in 1969, Holland College, a public community college created to provide programs in applied arts and technology, vocational training and adult education, was opened by an act of Legislature in order to provide new postsecondary educational choices to PEI residents.Industry Canada.

The university participation rate in New Brunswick continued to increase between 2005/06 and 2006/07; but this change could mainly be attributed to the Francophone population of New Brunswick. While participation rates were higher than the national average, the population of 18- to 24-year-olds in NB and the rest of the Maritime provinces were predicted to decline greater than the rest of Canada; undergraduate participation peaked in New Brunswick in 2003/04 and in Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia during the 2004/05 academic session. Between 1990 and 2000, the number of 18- to 24-year-olds dropped 13% in the Maritimes while the rest of Canada dropped less than 1%.

In Second World War the US Government requisitioned it as the troopship John Ericsson. After the war the Italian Home Lines bought her, renamed her Italia and operated her as a transatlantic liner and cruise ship. In the 1960s she changed hands again to become the hotel ship Imperial Bahama. She was scrapped in Spain in 1965. Trans-Atlantic passenger service Kungsholm operated on the transatlantic service with some cruise operations just prior to World War II. In June 1938, as flagship of the Swedish American Line, she visited Wilmington, Delaware with the Crown Prince Gustaf VI Adolf and Crown Princess Louise of Sweden, members of the Royal Swedish Commission, the Commission of the Republic of Finland and tourists aboard. The visit was in honor of the 300th anniversary of the Swedish landing with the Crown Prince's son Prince Bertil having to do the honors ashore as the Crown Prince was suffering from a kidney attack. For a brief time 1940‚Äì41, as Kungsholm was cruising the Caribbean after war broke out in Europe, the author J. D. Salinger was employed aboard as entertainment director. Wartime service The ship, under the command of Captain John Nordlander, was requisitioned effective 31 December 1941, placed under control of the United States Government's War Shipping Administration (WSA), renamed John Ericsson and delivered for contract operation by United States Lines as a troop transport largely to meet Army requirements. John Ericsson was one of seven transports hurriedly assembled in New York and sailing late on 22 January 1942 (23 January GMT) in what was then the largest troop movement attempted, movement of POPPY FORCE, also designated Task Force 6814, under General Alexander Patch to secure New Caledonia (codename POPPY) on the vital South Pacific link to Australia. At the time this force was being assembled the ship was allocated to the State Department and with its addition and cutting troops in convoys across the Atlantic the seven ships assembled had a troop capacity of almost 22,000. Task Force 6814 was later organized in New Caledonia as the Americal Division. John Ericsson was among the group of large, fast troop transports capable of running without escorts, that moved freely among wartime theaters as required. They included the large UK liners, several Allied liners, Navy and Army operated ships, and two sets of sister ships operated for the WSA: Moore- McCormack's , and Uruguay, and Matson Lines' , , Matsonia and . Cross-section Postwar service After the end of World War Two the John Ericsson was placed in the Hudson reserve fleet 28 April 1947 with fire damages estimated at between $500,000 and $1,500,000 to repair and offered for sale by bids 5 May on an \\"as is, where is\\" basis. The ship was sold back to the Swedish American Line with title passed on 18 July and the ship delivered to Swedish American Line 23 July 1947. Instead of returning to service with Swedish American Line the ship was sold to Home Lines in 1948 and renamed Italia. With Home Lines the ship served on various routes, including Genoa ‚Äî South America, Genoa ‚Äî New York, Hamburg ‚Äî New York, Hamburg ‚Äî Quebec, Bremen ‚Äî Quebec, New York ‚Äî Nassau as well as cruises from New York to the Caribbean. In 1964, the ship was sold to the Canaveral International Corporation for use as a 500-room floating hotel in Freeport, Bahamas. The ship was renamed Imperial Bahama, while the hotel complex with a 9-acre golf course, 4 tennis courts, a shopping center and a marina, was known as the Imperial Bahama Hotel.

It is one of the darker hued songs on The River. The lyrics are about a home that can no longer hold both father and son. The song is sung by the son to the father, opening with the line \\"Papa go to bed now, it's getting late\\", reversing the usual command of a father to a son. The son recognizes that despite their similarities, the father and son would never agree but just continue to argue constantly, and so it was time for the son to leave home. Allmusic critic William Ruhlmann said \\"Independence Day is an unusually sad, beautiful and private song, with a slow piano and a languid saxophone solo, as well as delicate organ and acoustic guitar work\\". The song has been described as Springsteen's best recorded vocal, with an unerring sincerity which fuels the song.

She was a unit of the Southern Squadron that cut off the Philippine insurgents' supplies on Samar; and assisted in the capture of Lukban, the insurgent leader in Samar, and the close blockade of the island of Samar, all of which contributed to the final declaration of armistice. Isla de Luzon was detached from the Asiatic Station on 15 August 1902, when she departed Cavite for the United States. Following long custom, when she visited Muscat's picturesque harbor, members of her crew painted \\"Isla de Luzon\\" on the steep entrance cliff; in later years this was periodically refurbished by visiting ships of the U.S. Navy Middle East Force Command. After transiting the Suez Canal and touching ports of the Mediterranean, she arrived at Pensacola, Florida on 16 March 1903. She was attached to the Pensacola Navy Yard until 6 December 1903, when she was assigned duty with the Louisiana Naval Militia; she was later transferred to the Missouri Naval Militia, and, two years later, to the Illinois Naval Militia on the Great Lakes. At the beginning of American participation in World War I in April 1917, Isla de Luzon was stationed at Chicago, as a training ship on the Great Lakes. She remained there until 30 September 1918 when she arrived at Narragansett Bay for assignment to the Naval Torpedo Station for duty with the Seamen Gunner's Class. Following the installation of torpedo tubes, she was on range in Narragansett Bay from 13 November 1918 until 13 December 1918. Isla de Luzon decommissioned 15 February 1919 and was designated as yard craft of the Naval Torpedo Station, Newport, Rhode Island until her name was struck from the Navy List on 23 July 1919.

The Federal Government decided on a policy to pay the provinces per student in higher education in each province. Nova Scotia had a smaller population than other provinces but had a large number of out-of-province and international students who did not remain in the province after graduation. The large number of universities meant that funding was very thinly distributed across the universities.  1960s  In the 1960s, the Federal Government put the responsibility of post secondary education back to the provinces. It agreed to grant up to half of the operating expenses of post secondary institutions in each province and provided special funding for research and special projects. Provincial governments had to provide the rest of the funding.  1970‚Äì1980s  In the 1970s, the Maritime Provinces Higher Education Commission (MPHEC) was established to act as one University Grants Commission for the Atlantic provincesAtlantic Canada. It allocated funds received from the Federal Government to each Atlantic province. Nova Scotia universities continued to lobby for an increase in capital funds and following the report of the Royal Commission on Post-Secondary Education in 1986, the Nova Scotia Council on Higher Education (NSCHE) was established, representing the interests of Nova Scotia on the MPHEC. In 1989, it became a legal entity under the Ministry of Advanced Education and Job Training.  1990s  In 1995, the Nova Scotia Council on Higher Education (NSCHE) began a process to review and recommend a new Funding Formula for Nova Scotia's universities.

Tuition  Tuition at Nova Scotian post secondary institutions is set by the individual institutions, in consultation with government. Since 2006, the provincial government has taken measures to bring tuition rates down to the average tuition fees levels in the country. In the six years of the last two MOUs, Nova Scotia went from having the highest average student tuition to being $8 below the national average for Nova Scotian students in Nova Scotian universities: 2006‚Äì2007: Federal Infrastructure Trust Fund money was directed to a one-time reduction in tuition for Nova Scotia students studying in Nova Scotia. 2007‚Äì2008: One-time $500 tuition reduction for Nova Scotia students; an amendment in the MOU froze tuition in the third year. 2008‚Äì2009: Second MOU continued the tuition freeze and introduced a $761 bursary for Nova Scotia students in Nova Scotia (Nova Scotia University Student Bursary Trust). 2009‚Äì2010: Tuition frozen and the bursary for Nova Scotia students at Nova Scotia universities rose to $1,022. 2010‚Äì2011: Tuition frozen and the bursary for Nova Scotia students at Nova Scotia universities rose to $1,283. For the first time, out of province Canadian students at Nova Scotia universities received a $261 bursary.  2011‚Äì2015  Despite strong public resistance and student rallies, the tuition freeze was lifted, resulting in tuition increases at institutions throughout the province. There was, however, a 3% cap implemented. The 2015-2016 NS Provincial budget, however, lifts the cap, allowing institutions to make a one-time market adjustments to tuition and fees. The cap is set to be reinstated the following year, but will no longer apply to out of province or graduate tuition fees, which will no longer be regulated. The bursaries have remained at $1,283 for Nova Scotia students and $261 for out of province students. The new 2015-2016 budget does not, however, make a commitment to continue offering the bursary for out of province students. Once some of the lowest in the country, tuition fees in Nova Scotia are now the third highest in the country ‚Äî average undergraduate tuition is $6,440 per year, according to Statistics Canada.  Student assistance and debt  Between 1990 and 2008, the average student debt in Nova Scotia, at the time of repayment, increased from $7,660 to $24,387 (+218%). In constant dollars there was an increase of 119 per cent (from $7,660 to $16,749). A spike in debt after 1992 followed the elimination of the Nova Scotia Bursary Program, which provided the full Nova Scotia student loan portion as a non-repayable bursary. From 1992 on, all student assistance was repayable loans. Eliminating the bursary program and rising tuition left students in Nova Scotia with the highest debt levels in the country. In 2008, there was a slight decrease in debt as a result of Nova Scotia's tuition reduction measures. Nova Scotia began lending directly to students, reducing the interest rate by two percentage points. A 20 per cent non-repayable grant was introduced, along with a grant for students with dependents. A repayment assistance program and a payment deferral program were introduced. As a result of a $12.5M investment in 2011 and a further $5.5M investment in 2012 to the Nova Scotia Student Assistance Program, students have increased and improved assistance available to them to support their post-secondary education. This assistance is in the form of increased non-repayable upfront grants and loans, increased allowance, increased in-study earnings exemption and improved electronic service. As well, the first Debt Cap program was initiated in 2011‚Äì12. Qualifying students for the program will have their debt capped at $28,560 per student. This program benefits students completing an undergraduate, non-professional degree program. It is claimed that the recent increases in tuition have all but negated the success of the grant program.

The human wizards depend on the White Council, while the vampires and faeries belong to various courts. The White Council The White Council is the governing body of the Wizard community in the world. They primarily protect humanity from abuses of magic, but also shield this world from the Sidhe and other creatures that wish humanity harm. It is also a political and democratic organization seeking to unite wizards throughout the world, and can make or break treaties with the other supernatural powers as necessary. Due to the multitude of nationalities present, meetings of the Council are traditionally conducted in Latin,Summer Knight a procedural point which has, not coincidentally, served to keep younger wizards from gaining too much standing or momentum by making it very difficult for them to speak eloquently or even coherently to the rest of the Council. The council meetings' dress code requires wizards to wear robes.Summer Knight, chapter four. Wizards and apprentices are differentiated by the color of their robes: black and brown respectively.Summer Knight, chapter five. In addition, full wizards wear a stole.Summer Knight, chapter six. The Council is governed by a Senior Council of seven wizards, with the leader referred to as the Merlin. Beyond the Senior Council, which constitutes the executive branch, there are the actual wizards of the council that contribute to the legislative branch. The Judicial branch belongs to the Wardens, a combination police force and military. The Senior Council The Senior Council is the executive branch of the White Council. It consists of seven wizards, selected by their peers among the most senior wizards. Its chair is entitled the Merlin; traditionally regarded as the most powerful wizard in the world, though the politicking required to secure the position may suggest that factors other than raw power are equally important. The Senior Council arrives at its decisions through majority vote, but the Merlin has proxy authority to cast the vote of any Senior Council member not present at a Senior Council meeting who has not designated a substitute; politicking at this level often turns simply on who does and does not arrive at a meeting before a vote is concluded. The Senior Council can reserve certain matters to the Senior Council only, not involving a vote of the White Council as a whole.Summer Knight, chapter six: \\"The Senior Council members can always take a matter to a close vote with three supporters\\". The Wardens The Wardens are the White Council's enforcers. Their primary role is to enforce the Seven Laws of Magic, and they are empowered to deliver summary judgment when confronting a violator of the Laws. This can be anything from advising new practitioners of the Laws, to delivering suspects to trial in front of the Senior Council, to simply beheading criminals in the field. During times of war (such as the conflict with the Red Court), Wardens also serve as the White Council's primary military force. The two \\"badges\\" of the office of Warden are their gray cloaks (which, according to Harry, blood cannot stain) and silver swords with the ability to break enchantments. The swords were custom forged for each individual Warden by the current Captain of the Wardens, Anastasia Luccio, but since the events of Dead Beat, she is currently unable to create the swords. It is this reason why Harry was not provided with a sword when he was made a Warden during the war with the Red Court. There are three ranks, or grades, of Wardens. * Captain: commands the entire force of Wardens.Dead Beat * Commander: commands significant forces of Wardens, such as a whole continent or part of a continent. Specific assignment may be established by the Captain. Commanders report to the Captain. * Warden: all members below Commander rank. It would appear that Warden rank nomenclature is more related to Navy grade nomenclature than that of the Army. Donald Morgan is not only a Warden, but a Commander as well; in the event that the Captain is incapacitated, Morgan becomes acting Captain. Morgan also appears to be of a higher rank than Dresden, however this may simply be due to seniority; however Morgan's rank is also mentioned in other books such as Storm Front. The Blackstaff In addition to the Wardens, the Council also secretly appoints one wizard to serve as its Blackstaff. The Blackstaff is given unique authority to violate the Seven Laws of Magic at his or her sole discretion without penalty‚Äîto be, as Harry phrases it in Blood Rites, the Council's \\"wetwork man\\", their covert assassin and counteragent. This was implemented as a last-ditch solution in situations where the Laws are being exploited to prevent the Council from taking necessary action against its enemies. This is currently Ebenezar McCoy (Harry Dresden's teacher after he killed his adopted father, Justin DuMorne with black magic). It was shown in Changes that The Blackstaff is not only the position held by McCoy, but also an object that he wields, an unmarked, unadorned staff of twisted black wood. The Blackstaff seems alive and tendrils from it creep up Ebenezar's arm as he uses it in battle. The Black Council A group that is thought to exist in opposition to the White Council. Despite Harry's suspicions, there has never been any direct evidence for the existence of the Black Council or for any members. Harry referred to them as \\"The Black Council\\" during a discussion with Ebenezar McCoy in Proven Guilty. In White Night, Warden Carlos Ramirez called them \\"The Black Hats\\", but agrees he likes the Black Council better. In the same novel, Harry overhears Vittorio Malvora and Madrigal Raith talk about \\"The Circle\\", which may be the name the Black Council uses to refer to themselves. There is much speculation as to who may be a member of the Black Council. Current suspects include: * a Denarian (possibly Thorned Namshiel and/or Tessa) * a member of the Senior Council * Samuel Peabody * the Naagloshii * Madeline Raith * Madrigal Raith * Vittorio Malvora * Cowl * Gregori Cristos The Black Council may have used a restaurant in Cairo, Egypt as a meeting place, according to information given to Harry by Binder. Further information about Nemesis in Cold Days and what Nicodemus calls \\"contamination\\" in Small Favor leads Harry to surmise that the Black Council may be just a part of those infected by Nemesis, a contagion of the mind from the Outside, aiding the ongoing attempt of The Outsiders to breach the Gates and enter our universe with apocalyptic consequences. At the end of Proven Guilty, Ebenezar McCoy and Harry Dresden suspect the existence of a hitherto unknown group of black wizards, and other beings, which Harry dubs the Black Council. Evidence of this group includes the surprisingly strong offensive power of the vampire courts during the war, the betrayal of secret Warden safeholds, the self-destructive actions of the faerie courts, dangerous magical items given to mortal authorities, the number of black wizards and magical foes that Harry has faced in previous books, and the summoning of Outsider demons, which can be done only through mortal magic. The identities of this group's members are unknown, although McCoy and Dresden suspect that at least one member of the White Council‚Äîand likely the Senior Council‚Äîis in league with this group. They believed the traitor is one of four people, Morgan, Injun Joe, Ancient Mai, or the Merlin, as they were the only Council members to be aware of the location of the Warden boot camp which was leaked to the Red Court. As Ebenezar vouched for Injun Joe and Harry vouched for Morgan it would seem that either Ancient Mai or the Merlin himself is the traitor. (note: this theory conveniently leaves out Warden Luccio, who also knew the location.) In Turn Coat the secretary of the White Council, Samuel Peabody, is exposed as a traitor. A group of Senior Council members containing Injun Joe, Ancient Mai and Ebenezar McCoy is also attacked by two members of the Black Council, Peabody and an unknown other - possibly clearing Ancient Mai. It is unclear what this does to the status of the traitor, but suggests that Peabody might also have had access to the information through the means he used to manipulate the Senior Council, or Warden Luccio (who was put under Peabody's influence through magical means). Alternatively the traitor could be the Merlin, or the new member of the Senior Council, Gregori Cristos. One definite member of the Black Council (initially encountered by Harry in Dead Beat), is the necromancer calling himself Cowl. He appears to have once been affiliated with Kemmler, one of history's most powerful and terrifying necromancers. In White Night, he is affiliated with an organization calling itself the Circle, which may be the Black Council's own name for itself. Events in Small Favor seems to indicate that at least one holder of a Blackened Denarius, Thorned Namshiel, is among the Black Council, though his status is now unclear. It is also suspected that either Tessa (Imariel) or Rosanna, possibly both, are members of the Black Council. In Cold Days it is implied that a contagion called Nemesis (nicknamed The Adversary due to the danger of even naming it) is an Outsider mind-affecting virus, attempting to destroy everyone and/or allow Outsiders in. The force appears to be able to infect individuals upon contact, changing their motivations to be aligned with the Outsiders' aims. It is possible that the Black Council is not so much a conspiracy as just a collective name for those wizards infected. The adversary keeps its own existence secret by killing or infecting anyone who appears to know of it. Those known infected by the end of Cold Days include Maeve, Cat Sith, the Leanansidhe, and Aurora. Many of those suspected of being Black Council members may also have been infected. Queen Mab claims that the infection entered Winter's realm through a magic athame given to the Leanansidhe by the Red Court, infecting Maeve and perhaps others. She also claims that the Leanansidhe was infected but has been cured. Those who know of the adversary but are not yet apparently infected include Mother Winter, Mother Summer, Mab, Titania, The Gatekeeper, and Harry. The Grey Council As of Turn Coat, Ebenezar McCoy has begun forming a Grey Council, members of which are wizards and non-wizards whose identity only McCoy is aware of. Its formation is a response to the Black Council, which secretly exists within the magical community, and its intention is to be an even more secret council. Of the thirteen members, only three are known as of Changes: Harry Dresden, the current Winter Knight; Ebenezar McCoy, current Blackstaff; and Donar Vadderung, (a current identity of the Norse god Odin), CEO of Monoc Securities. Due to her involvement in Changes, it is highly likely that the Leanansidhe is, if not a member of this Council, a willing ally. Vampire Courts There are three vampire courts which have made appearances in the novels: White Court, Red Court, and Black Court. A fourth, the Jade Court, has been mentioned but no information has been provided about them as of the novel except that they are very secretive. These courts made their first appearance in Storm Front. White Court This Court is the most human-like group of vampires. They are similar to succubi and incubi, feeding off the emotions and life force of their prey. They are born to their vampiric state, rather than being created (as is the case with Black and Red Court). They are for all intents and purposes human until their vampirism manifests sometime around the age of their maturity. As with the Red Court, their first feeding (with its subsequent and almost inevitable kill) usually marks their full transformation. However, under specific circumstances, individuals descended from White Court vampires may curtail their transformation into vampires; see Blood Rites. There are different Houses within the White Court, each comprising a close-knit family. There is much in-fighting between the Houses, but House Raith is considered to be the most powerful. The Houses are mainly distinguished by their choice of emotion to feed upon, but this has been represented as a strong preference rather than a restriction. Those of House Raith are sexual predators, using their supernatural good looks and psychic aura to attract both men and women. During intercourse, or any direct physical contact where emotions like lust are heightened, they feed off their prey. Victims of the feedings of House Raith grow to enjoy the experience and become bonded to their predator like a drug addiction. House Malvora's members feed off fear. Most prefer very strong fear such as that of being in a potentially deadly situation, but some (such as Thomas's cousin Madrigal) satisfy themselves with smaller scares like those created by horror and slasher movies, of which Madrigal was a writer and director. The vampires of House Skavis feed off despair, preferring to drive a victim into the depths of depression and in many cases driving them to suicide. The White Court is not endowed with as much physical strength as the Red or Black courts under normal circumstances; usually, their physical performance levels (standing jump heights, endurance and so on) are slightly better than those an ordinary human of equivalent size and health, but they can channel unused emotional energy as fuel for performance boosts of limited duration. On the other hand, they make up for it by having far fewer vulnerabilities. Sunlight and symbols of faith do not harm them at all (Thomas feels \\"uneasy\\" at the thought of entering a church, but this is possibly due more to his own guilt than any objective vulnerability, as he was in fact able to enter the church). Their power derives from an internal demonic essence they call the \\"Hunger\\" which acts like a battery. If they refrain from feeding for too long, the \\"Hunger\\" drives them into a frenzy where they must feed (almost always killing their victims), and can drive them permanently insane. When needed, they tap this store of energy to augment their strength, speed, resilience, and healing ability far beyond normal; while doing this, they radiate waves of cold (possibly an illusory reaction of normal humans to their energy sink), their skin whitens, and their eyes turn an unnatural silver. White Court vampire blood is pinkish instead of red and has a euphoric effect if ingested. Their largest weakness is true love: people who are, or have recently been, in real, affectionate and sacrificial love are highly resistant to White Court control, and can even physically burn and blister vampire skin. Also, White Court vampires are born, not turned like Red and Black Court vampires; if the offspring of a White Court falls in love with someone that feels the same way before feeding for the first time, the love can destroy the demonic side before it can manifest allowing the person to live a normal, mortal life. Unlike the other courts, the White Court prefers to avoid direct confrontation. They are a court of schemers and prefer to stab each other in the back in exquisitely detailed plots to impress the others in the Court, to the extent that direct confrontation is looked down upon as socially damaging. At the moment Thomas's father is, in name only, the King of the White Court. In reality, Thomas's older sister Lara is in charge, pulling the strings from the background to keep up appearances. As of White Night, the leaders of the Malvora and Skavis houses were killed in the White Court coup in the Raith Deeps caused by Vittorio Malvora. This has left Lara with a larger, if less challenged, power base in the White Court. In White Night, it is revealed that the language of the White Court is Etruscan. Red Court The Red Court of Vampires are less human-like than the White Court. Instead they are slimy bat-like creatures hidden behind incredibly sensuous human costumes (made of an outer skin). It is revealed in Changes that the oldest and most powerful red court vampires are capable of wearing any flesh mask (that is, turn into any human), and that their flesh masks can fully protect them from the sun, so that they can walk about in broad daylight. They use these costumes to trick their prey into being more comfortable and to hide in plain sight. They are incredibly strong and fast, and can shake off most injuries quickly. The Red Court is vulnerable to sunlight and to having their bellies cut open, which can spill the blood they have drunk and eventually kill them. Their saliva contains a potent magical narcotic which gives the prey a euphoric feeling and is highly addictive, allowing the Red Court to control their victims rather easily. The narcotic lowers the victim's inhibitions while dulling the pain of the vampire's bite. Addicted humans have been shown to go to great lengths to protect their vampiric masters, and willingly provide information from the mortal community as needed. The Red Court is also capable of transforming ordinary humans into vampires in a two-step process: the human is first infected with the vampiric thirst for blood (gaining supernatural speed, strength and endurance in the process) and then completes the change into the demonic form upon killing a human victim in their first feeding. Infected humans with sufficient strength of will have been known to refrain from feeding for an indefinite length of time (magical bonds, regular exposure to sunlight, and avoiding physical intimacy all help), but no cure has yet been found for the \\"half-vampire\\" infected state. It is intimated that the Faerie Queen Mothers, or a being of similar power, could cure, or rather completely destroy, the vampiric infection with a magic known as an Unraveling (see Summer Knight). Their hunger for blood makes controlling their emotions very difficult, and when in a situation where emotions run high (such as during a fight or when engaged in physical intimacy), it is much easier for them to lose control. The Red Court is highly organized in a feudalistic system with a King at the top, followed by Dukes and other ranks. The Red Court began a war against the White Council in response to Harry's actions in Grave Peril, and the war is a long-running plot thread, continuing through subsequent books with the White Council on the defensive and struggling against the Red Court and their allies, while being assisted only by a few smaller allied organizations and limited help from the Faerie world in \\"Proven Guilty\\" as well as Changes\\". In the events described in White Night, the White Court of Vampires, headed by Lara Raith and her figurehead father, the King of the White Court, urged that there be a peace between Wizards and Vampires. In Turn Coat, it is confirmed that the Vampire Courts are just \\"catching their breath\\" in order to attack again. Also in Turn Coat, it is stated that the Red King is an incredibly powerful vampire who has lived nearly four thousand years. In Changes, the Red Court attempts to use an ancient and powerful blood curse in order to kill Ebenezer McCoy, by killing his great-granddaughter (Harry's daughter) Maggie. The curse is activated through a sacrifice, which results in the instant and complete death of any and all living members of the sacrifice's bloodline. During the climax of Changes, Harry turns the blood curse against the Red Court by sacrificing Susan Rodriguez, who had become a full-fledged Red Court Vampire, to the blood curse, resulting in virtually every Red Court Vampire being wiped out because they all share a connection through the Red King. Dresden theorises that possibly some have managed to survive, the youngest and weakest and possibly any in the Nevernever when the curse was activated, but as a result the Red Court is now effectively extinct. Black Court The Black Court comprises the most well-known kind of vampire, the reanimated bloodthirsty corpses popularized by Bram Stoker's Dracula. In fact, in the Dresdenverse, the publication of that book at the behest of the White Council is believed to be the primary cause of the Court's downfall, as Stoker supposedly published the book as a \\"how-to\\" manual to hunt the Black Court. Black Court vampires still inhabit the human bodies that they lived in before they were turned into vampires, with the only difference being their bodies rotting like zombies in the time that they have been undead. Black Court vampires possess all the classic strengths and weaknesses of Stoker's Dracula: they can lift and throw cars with one hand and crash through concrete walls without harm; but must sleep in their native soil and fear garlic and objects of faith. Sunlight, while deadly to younger members of the Black Court, is merely an inconvenience to older members, weakening them significantly, as in Stoker's novel. Mavra, an ancient Black Court vampire, has demonstrated the ability to use magic in the same way wizards do. Before Changes, the Black Court was the smallest and (politically) weakest of the Courts, although those few who survived the purges caused by Stoker's book are among the strongest and most cunning monsters in the world by virtue of sheer Darwinian necessity. They also have the ability to enthrall humans to be passive and submissive, and cultivate \\"Renfields\\" (another Stoker reference and similarity to Stoker's Dracula). Where thralls may have their minds restored with minimal lasting effects, Renfields are thralls that have been altered to the point of psychosis, and their minds are too far gone to be returned to normal. A Renfield has had his strength and agility augmented and will kill in a berserker frenzy until put down. Until let loose by their controlling vampire, a Renfield will appear as a normal thrall in a trance- like state; however, their true nature can be seen with a wizard's Sight. Jade Court Very little has been revealed about the Jade Court in the Dresden books, so next to nothing is known. In Death Masks while driving to McAnally's to decide the time, location, and weapons for the duel, Harry Dresden asks Shiro if he ever dueled vampires. Shiro answers: \\"Hai. Jade Court. Black Court.\\" When Harry asks for more information, Shiro answers: \\"Southeast Asia, China, Japan. Very secretive. But they respect the Accords.\\" This is all that has been said about the Jade Court so far. When asked in the 2014 Chicago Book Signing, Jim Butcher responded by saying that more information will be revealed about them in coming books, but they are unlikely to appear directly. Faerie Courts The Sidhe Courts (Summer and Winter) are the two ruling bodies of the Sidhe and their lands make up most of the Nevernever. Their combined power can affect the real world through the barrier of the Nevernever, and maintaining the balance of power is greatly important to most members of the supernatural community. It supposedly is responsible for the continued cycle of the seasons, and is rumored that great ecological disasters such as ice ages and global warming were caused by imbalances between the two Sidhe courts. Each court is ruled by three Queens‚ÄîQueen Mother (neither of whom have been given a name outside of their title of Mother Summer and Mother Winter), Queen, and Lady. Bob refers to the three as \\"The Queen Who Was,\\" \\"The Queen Who Is,\\" and \\"The Queen Who Is To Come\\" respectively. They are forbidden from taking hostile action against mortals without their consent‚Äîsuch as making a deal with one of the Sidhe. However, each court has a Knight, a mortal champion appointed by a Queen, who may involve him or herself in mortal affairs. Furthermore, the author has stated that Winter and Summer each have a Fae lord that might be considered a King, who is temperamentally opposite to the Queen. In Cold Days, it is revealed that the position of the Queen, the Lady and the Knight are mantles, which are similar to positions of office, each with associated powers and personality traits, that can be transferred from one suitable person to another. The person holding the mantle is known as the vessel. If the current Queen, Lady, or Knight dies, then the mantle usually transfers to the nearest vessel, as demonstrated in Summer Knight when the Summer Lady Aurora died, and her mantle then transferred to Lily, who was the Summer Knight at the time, turning Lily into the new Summer Lady. It is currently unknown what makes a person a suitable vessel, though it is implied that extensive contact with and knowledge of the Fae are contributing factors that make someone an ideal prospective vessel. Bearing the mantles has an effect on the vessel's personality and behaviour, influencing the person towards fulfilling the duties of their position. For example, the Winter Knight acts as the champion, enforcer and assassin of the Winter Court, so the Winter Knight is influenced to become more predatory and animalistic. The novels imply that as time wears on the mantles tend to gradually wear away and overtake the vessel's original personality, until the current vessel becomes nigh-indistinguishable from the previous one. The rate and degree of these personality changes seems to depend upon the vessel. Sidhe cannot tell a direct lie, but instead are masters of twisting words in order to convey falsehoods without actually lying. They are strictly concerned with the wording rather than the intent of agreements and will specifically place loopholes in agreements which they can exploit. In almost every case, a mortal making a deal with a Sidhe will end up causing the mortal to get the short end of the stick with any attempts to withdraw from the deal causing the mortal to become further entangled with the Sidhe. Sidhe are also vulnerable to cold iron. This weakness also extends to any form or alloy of iron, such as steel blades or iron nails. The Knight of each court does appear to share, to an extent, the vulnerability to cold iron, human though he may have begun. The Knight's power also appears to depend (sometimes) on his allegiance to his court. The two sides are engaged in a perpetual Cold War, in which both sides are mobilized for battle but never engage in anything more than skirmishes. Large battles between the two courts have great effects in nature including weather patterns, and are usually avoided unless there is no other choice such as in the events of the novel Summer Knight. Each side is stronger during their namesake season, with the balance of power shifting during the Summer and Winter Solstices. Despite their ongoing conflict, both Queen Mothers live together seemingly peacefully in a cottage. Also, members from both courts have worked together, most recently the Winter Lady and Summer Lady in the events of the novel Proven Guilty. The Sidhe exchange control of an artifact called the Stone Table twice a year at Midsummer and Midwinter. Whichever Court is in control of the Table steadily gains in power, and in order to preserve the balance, the Summer Court hand it over at Midsummer, the height of their strength, and the Winter Court hand it over at Midwinter, the height of their strength. The power of any being killed upon the Stone Table goes instantly and permanently to the court which is currently in possession of it. Summer Court (Seelie) The Summer Court is the more warm and caring side, but is just as scheming as its Winter counterpart. Summer faeries typically are more nurturing of mortals, but this is not always true. They are associated with the element of fire. Their lands in the Nevernever are bright, sunny, warm, and lush with vegetation. Most of the lesser creatures of Summer are typically not malicious, but can seem so when they involve themselves in mortal affairs. It is important to note that the Summer Court is not inherently \\"good\\", and that victory over Winter is not a desirable outcome. As Bob explains to Harry, such a triumph would result in an era of rampant growth, including, it is implied, the explosive growth and spread of disease organisms. Titania has ruled as Summer Queen throughout the series. The Erlking, the Wyldfae leader of the Goblins and the Wild Hunt, while generally apart from the court could be considered (per the author) a sort of Summer King. The original Summer Lady, Aurora, was slain by a squad of Wyldfae (see below) during the events of Summer Knight, being replaced by a former changeling (half-human, half-Sidhe) named Lily. Ronald Reuel, the Summer Knight, is slain by the Winter Knight at the beginning of the same book, with the role subsequently being taken by Fix, another former changeling. At the end of Cold Days the mantle is passed to Sarissa, when Lily is killed by the Winter Lady Maeve. Winter Court (Unseelie) The Winter Court is colder and much more merciless than its Summer counterpart. The lands of Winter resemble a tundra or frozen wasteland, with the center being Arctis Tor, a massive fortress made of black ice. Some of the lesser creatures of Winter include trolls, goblins and fetches, spirits which feed on the fear of others. The Winter Queen and Winter Lady throughout the series to date have been Mab and Maeve respectively until the recent change during Cold Days with the Winter Lady's mantle being transmitted to Molly Carpenter. Lloyd Slate, the Winter Knight was revealed as a traitor during the events of Summer Knight and was subsequently subjected to repeated tortures by Mab. Eventually, during the events of Changes, Slate was killed and replaced as Winter Knight by Harry Dresden. Harry's godmother, the Leanansidhe (\\"Lea\\" for short), is also a very powerful member of the Winter Court. Winter's effective King is Kringle (Santa Claus). Wyldfae The Wyldfae are creatures of Faerie which do not belong to either Winter or Summer. Most of them do freelance work instead, capable of choosing whichever side they want in a given conflict. During full-scale conflicts, the Wyldfae feel a \\"calling\\" which drives them to choose one side or the other. If they are forced to choose sides in a war between Summer and Winter, they will align themselves with the faction most appealing to their personalities. Therefore, the nastier and more murderous aid Winter over Summer. There is no direct leader of the Wyldfae, although the being known as the Erlking or Elfking is probably the closest counterpart.The Erlking is one of several Faerie Kings. These Kings are Wyldfae on the fringes of their respective Courts, Winter and Summer, and therefore generally are not known as Powers within the Courts. =Goblins= Goblins are vaguely humanoid fae that all carry irregular features, varying in size and shape, are aesthetically repugnant but all have gleaming red eyes. They are devious, intelligent and ruthless, subduing a group of vampires and their Ick in the dark in a matter of seconds and then later ripping them apart.The Erlking is the lord of the goblins and is one of the predatory beings that can be summoned by ritual to Earth to lead \\"The Wild Hunt\\", a massive predatory stampede in which the Erlking calls all nearby beings (mortal, supernatural, faerie, or otherwise) who consider themselves hunters to join him in his charge. =Little folk/Dewdrop faeries= The Little folk (also known as dew drop faeries or polevoi) are small winged faeries that glow in various colours. They have relatively short memory spans and are quite emotional. They often observe many mortal events, considering them as entertainment. Their large numbers and their ability to move around without attracting attention, their abilities, especially in acquiring information, are greatly underestimated by most. Harry develops a loyal group of Dew drop faeries (called the \\"Za Lord's Guard\\") in the course of the series; they follow him for a regular payment of pizza‚Äîwith which they are infatuated‚Äîand for the glory and honor they accrue among other Dewdrop fae by conducting successful missions on behalf of their \\"Za Lord\\" (Dresden). They can vary in size from fly-sized, such as Elidee in Summer Knight to Toot- toot's fifteen inches tall as of Changes, though Toot's size is an increase from when first seen in Storm Front, possibly due to the power he has amassed from increasing followers in the Za-lord's guard. =Cobbs= Cobbler elves who are obsessed with shoes, crying out when Harry threatens to snap a pair of Prada stilettos in the short story \\"It's My Birthday Too\\". They seem to count as a subset of the Little Folk. =Tylwyth Teg= The Tylwyth Teg are an independent kingdom of the wyldfae ruled by their king Gwyn ap Nudd. They are small, only a few feet tall however can take on the form of any creature, having a particular fondness for goats, but can look like any creature including human. In the short story \\"Curses\\" it is revealed that if treated well by mortals they would perform tasks for them (grooming of goats being a common one) and if respect was not shown, they could retaliate, going so far as to kill. Changelings The offspring of a fae and a mortal is called a changeling. They may have odd appearances, depending on their parentage. The offspring of a human and a troll, for example, may appear as a human which is incredibly tall and broadly built with a bulky mass and well-defined jaw. Other changelings have been shown as simply having oddly colored hair, such as green. Changelings must eventually choose whether to become a mortal or a Sidhe. Upon making the choice, the changeling becomes either completely mortal or Sidhe, no longer retaining any of the characteristics of the other half. It is unknown if there is any specific time or age at which a changeling must choose, but during times of war, they are affected by the calling to choose just as the Wyldfae are. At least one changeling, Sarissa, managed to avoid choosing one side or another of her heritage for decades, without aging. This may have been due to the support of her mother, Queen Mab. Knights of the Cross Also known as the Knights of the Sword, the Knights are people chosen to wield one of three holy swords that God sent to Earth. Much like the legendary Excalibur (actually Amoracchius), the swords serve the righteous for a just cause. Each is reputed to bear a nail from Christ's crucifixion inside the hilt. They cannot be touched by \\"unclean\\" beings, although this protection can be disabled if the bearer attempts to use them in a dishonorable or evil way; the only known way to destroy a Sword is to use it to kill a truly innocent being, or alternatively, in an act that goes against its nature (Faith, Hope, and Love). The three swords, whose Latin names represent the three prominent Christian virtues, are: * Amoracchius (Love), a broadsword, currently possessed by Harry Dresden after the events of Small Favor left Michael Carpenter too wounded to wield the sword anymore. In Proven Guilty, Michael states in a conversation with Harry that the original Merlin was briefly a custodian for Amoracchius, and speculates that the sword may actually be Excalibur, as it has never actually been altered like the other two have. As a result of the events of Small Favor the sword was given to Harry for safekeeping, making him the steward of both Amoracchius and Fidelacchius. However, it is unclear whether or not Michael can still wield the sword. In one of Butcher's short stories, a newly swordless Michael wields a baseball bat and a decidedly less loving attitude. The sword can be unmade if it is used to kill an innocent. The Sword of Love is used by Susan, despite her being a half-vampire, during Changes, as she wields it for the love of her daughter. It is confirmed as Excalibur in Ghost Story. When Harry becomes the new Winter Knight, stewardship passes from Harry to Karrin Murphy, as Murphy is unsure how much influence Winter has on him. In the novel Skin Game, Michael briefly wields the sword again after the archangel Uriel lends him his angelic power. At the end of Skin Game, Michael gives the sword back to Harry for safekeeping in Demonreach. * Fidelacchius (Faith), Also known as Kusanagi, formerly possessed by Shiro Yoshimo, the Knight who trained Michael. Its first appearance was that of a katana with a water-patterned steel blade and a wooden-cane scabbard. Later on, it takes the form a Star Wars-inspired lightsaber. Following the death of Shiro at the hands of the Order of the Blackened Denarius in Death Masks, the sword, in its katana-form, was in the temporary care of Harry Dresden. According to Michael, Harry is the only member of the White Council to hold a sword in care since the original Merlin. Karrin Murphy briefly wielded it in Small Favor and was given what Harry called a \\"job offer\\" but turned it down. It can be unmade if it is used in an act of treachery. In Changes, Karrin Murphy briefly takes up the sword, however, in \\"Aftermath\\", one of the short stories in the collection Side Jobs, she deliberately chooses not to use the sword, reasoning both that it could much too easily become a crutch, and that without her hand to wield it, the sword is nothing but a sharpened piece of steel, thus making the HAND the important thing... and she already has two of those with her. After the shooting of Harry at the end of Changes and the events on Demonreach at the end of Cold Days, Murphy, not knowing how the Winter Knight Mantle will affect Harry, takes up stewardship of Amoracchius and Fidelacchius. In the novel Skin Game, Murphy uses Fidelacchius in an attempt to kill a then defenseless Nicodemus Archleone, an act that goes against its nature, and it is shattered into several pieces. At the climax of the novel, Harry attempts to throw the hilt of the broken sword to Charity Carpenter to use, but it ends up in the hand of Waldo Butters. In his hands, the sword emits a blinding light from the broken hilt, and drawing from Butter's faith, becomes a lightsaber that he uses to beat Nicodemus back. At the end of the novel, Butters remarks on the incredulity that the newest Knight of the Cross is Jewish. * Esperacchius (Hope), Also known as Durendal, the sword of Roland gifted by Charlemagne (in legend, called Durendal) is a heavy saber, currently possessed by a Knight known only as Sanya, a young Russian man of African descent with a bleak personal history with the Order of the Blackened Denarius as he was once possessed by a Denarian himself. He has claimed that the archangel Michael himself gave him his sword; despite this encounter, he claims to be agnostic. It is unknown what circumstance can unmake the Sword of Hope, but presumably it would be an act of despair, one that goes against that fundamental nature of Hope (e.g. suicide). The Knights are endowed with the power of Faith. Their swords act as foci for their faith, and seem able to harm any supernatural being, including those whose respective mythological vein runs parallel to Christian mythos. The Swords are shown to inflict pain on faeries, though this may be a vulnerability to cold steel more than anything else. The Knights are also frequent beneficiaries of seemingly coincidental events that either aid their cause or lead them to places where their assistance is required (such as Father Forthill's coincidental appearances at the Carpenter household in Grave Peril when someone is needed to look after Michael's children in his absence, or of Fidelacchius bouncing into Butters' hand instead of Charity's). Very little information is given on the Knights, though Shiro was revealed to be a descendant of Sh≈ç Tai, the last king of Okinawa. The only Knight to be featured prominently in the series is Michael. It is revealed in Small Favor that both Michael and Sanya are also descendants of kings much like Shiro was, Michael a descendant of Charlemagne and Sanya counting Saladin amongst his ancestors. This has led Harry to believe that the swords should be given to someone who has descended from royalty, as kings were thought to be spiritual and physical protectors of their people. However, Harry has stated that this is only a theory. The original founding purpose of the Knights was to battle The Order of the Blackened Denarius (see below) and redeem those humans corrupted into serving the Fallen. The archangels who gift the swords also watch over the wielders, and as a result, the Knights of the Cross can bring almost unstoppable power to bear if their guardian spirits choose to manifest (as happens in Changes). Fellowship of St. Giles A relatively new player on the supernatural scene, the Fellowship of St. Giles (named for the patron saint of cripples) is largely made up of people who have been infected by Red Court vampires, but have yet to drink the lifeblood of another human to complete their transformation. The Fellowship helps its members control their urges, support each other, and fight the vampires who infected them. They are allied with the White Council in the war against the Red Court, but have little communication with them. Despite their recent emergence on the playing field, a member of the Blackened Denarius recognized Susan as a member because of her markings. They have mystic tattoos placed all over their bodies that both grant them more restraint and act as a warning when they expend too much strength and are in danger of losing control. Normally the tattoos are not visible, but as the person uses the abilities their partial transformation gives them they begin to change. They initially are black and seem to swirl on the skin. As the Fellowship member reaches the danger zone, the tattoos turn red. Being a half-vampire grants great potential strength, speed, and the ability to recover from incredible injury if they drink blood. Drawing on these powers creates massive amounts of bloodlust which is increasingly difficult to control. Due to the events in Changes, the Fellowship is essentially defunct. The half-vampires have been cured (those not slain by Red Court treachery), although the older half-vampires succumbed to the blood curse along with the full-blooded Red Court vampires, and the Red Court itself has been destroyed. Venatori Umbrorum An ancient order of humans dedicated to fighting the darker aspects of the supernatural. What they lack in magical or supernatural powers, they make up for in political influence, knowledge, and conventional firepower. Very little is known about the Venatori; Harry describes them as being \\"like the Masons, but with flame throwers.\\" While they have some armed assets, they excel at using their influence in society to hinder the movement of supernatural predators such as vampires. The Venatori Umbrorum have been credited with freezing bank accounts, cutting supply lines, exposing mortal collaborators, and even going so far as assassinating or kidnapping human agents of the Vampire Courts. They are allied with the White Council in the war against the Red Court. The order's name, Venatori Umbrorum, is Latin, translating to \\"Shadows of the hunters\\" (literally \\"The Hunters of Shadows\\"). The group acts as unwitting cover for an even more secretive group referred to simply as the Venatori (\\"Hunters\\" in Latin) who specifically exist to stamp out knowledge of demonic gods, a task they call the Oblivion War. There are approximately 5,000 Venatori Umbrorum and 200 Venatori. Thomas Raith, Harry Dresden's vampiric half-brother, and his sister Lara are among the Venatori. The novelette \\"Backup: A Story of the Dresden Files\\" describes this relationship in detail. Stygian Sisterhood A secretive group of followers of a number of half-forgotten demons, which try to reclaim their former status as gods and their following. Since their bond with the real world lies in the knowledge human beings have of them; the Stygian Sisterhood, therefore, try to increase the number of the people who know and believe in them. The magical community tries to counteract this by decreasing this number; the Venatori and Venatori Umbrorum are two groups implicated in this process - the \\"Oblivion War\\". Also, the Archive is one of the most powerful agents in this war - by remembering anything written down, she is exactly aware how strong the bond between any ex-god with the real world, and can promptly forget about them whenever she deems said bond is weak enough. Ordo Lebes and Paranet During the events of White Night, Harry becomes involved with a group of lower-level magic users calling themselves the Ordo Lebes, or Order of the Cauldron (which Harry mistakenly translates as Large Cooking Pot, only to be corrected by Murphy). They are a group that has banded together to gain a measure of protection from supernatural threats. After the novel's events, Harry and Elaine Mallory, with the help of the Ordo, set up the Paranet, a method for low level magic users to stay connected on the national scale. Ghost Story reveals that the Paranet has exploded in size since the death of Harry Dresden. Under the guidance of Karrin Murphy and Elaine, the Paranet is attempting to safeguard people with magical abilities from the aggressive incursions of the Fomor. Membership is up to thirty thousand people, and Harry's home in Chicago has become a virtual fortress to protect magically capable people as part of the greater Chicago Alliance. In Cold Days, the Paranet has become even more central and powerful, uniting minor magical folk against the Fomor. A geek conspiracist is the one who finds the critical clues indicating where the magical rituals that will disrupt Demonreach are being held, including out on the water, and thus where to direct the hit teams to attack them. Ragged Angel Investigations Ragged Angel Investigations is a detective agency located in a broken-down office on the outskirts of gang territory in Chicago, where Harry started as an apprentice PI; after three years, Harry earned his license and opened his own office. In addition to minor jobs on behalf of the police, the agency deals with cases involving missing children. Shapeshifters Multiple breeds of shapeshifters have been encountered in the Dresdenverse. The one thing all have in common is that none of them, so far, demonstrate the classic contagious bite as seen in books and films and cannot infect surviving victims with their condition (in \\"Fool Moon\\", Bob states that if this were so, the entire planet would be overrun with werewolves in a few years). \\"Classic\\" werewolf The \\"classic\\" werewolf is someone who uses magic to transform themselves into a wolf. This is not necessarily a wizard or well-trained practitioner of magic, since the transformation spell will work for anyone who learns it. The physical body is transformed, but the mind remains the same. This can be a disadvantage in the beginning because, although the person gains all the senses of a wolf, they do not have the life experience of using them. The werewolf must learn to use smell and hearing as their primary sensory input rather than sight, and learn to move and react to their environment as a four-legged creature. All this takes time, but the werewolf can eventually learn to do well in their new form. The wolf form has all the natural capabilities of an ordinary wolf; silver is not needed to kill them and they do not heal wounds any more quickly than normal wolves under normal circumstances. This type of werewolf can reassume its human form whenever it wishes, and through experimentation, they may learn to apply the ability to manipulate their tissues to healing small wounds, such as muscular lacerations. The transformation spell can be cast on another, forcing someone to assume the form of a wolf (or any animal the caster chooses). This is a violation of the Second Law of Magic, because the mind of the transformed person is eventually lost and all that is left is the mind of a wolf. If the spell is reversed in time, the victim will recover; however, once lost, the personality cannot be restored and the person is, in a sense, dead. The Alphas are the werewolves featured predominately in the series. =Alphas= The Alphas are a group of college werewolves that act as Harry's apprentices and backup in the series. As classic werewolves they were taught a wolf transformation spell by a wolfwere (a wolf that can become human), Tera, as well as how to behave in their transformed state. They are initially slightly nerdy students led by the werewolf Billy. While physically weaker than many of their adversaries they make up for this with the use of teamwork and guerrilla tactics, such as ambushes and hit and run operations. In the beginning of the series, the Alphas fought and travelled in large numbers. However, due to graduations of the students and other life happenings, most have moved on. By the time of \\"Harry's day off\\" the Alphas are down to four members and lose one more in the events of Turn Coat. However, they are increasingly competent at their tasks, gaining enough of Harry's respect to become among the truly 'clued in'. Will has demonstrated that they can use their shapechanging ability to quickly heal wounds, although it causes great hunger to do so. The current members of the Alphas are Will (the leader), Georgia (Will's wife), Andi (the cute redhead) and Marci (returned in Side Jobs). Hexenwolf A hexenwolf uses a talisman imbued with powerful magic to transform itself into a huge wolf. The hexenwolf's wolf form is much larger and more powerful than any natural wolf, possessing enhanced speed, strength, and ferocity. The only part of the hexenwolf that is unaffected by the transformation are the eyes, which remain the same color as their human form. The talisman itself may take many forms, including a ring or amulet, but most commonly appears as a belt made from a wolf pelt. The talisman engenders the transformation by providing an anchor for a spirit of bestial rage, and is activated with an incantation by the wearer. This spirit protects the human personality while in wolf form. However, the hexenwolf loses all human inhibitions and runs more on primal human desires. The hexenwolf can be wounded or killed by normal weapons and can be forced to transform back into human form if someone manages to remove their talisman. A hexenwolf may reassume human form at will, but the power that the talisman gives the user is addictive‚Äîin many cases, this addiction begins to affect the user's mind and personality in human form, much like a drug addict needing a fix. The most seriously afflicted lose all impulse control, becoming violent and sociopathic. Harry briefly became a hexenwolf to fight off another hexenwolf. See Fool Moon. Loup-garou A Loup-garou is the closest to the monsters of legend. These werewolves have been intentionally cursed by someone, usually a very powerful sorcerer, demon lord, saint, or one of the Faerie Queens to be possessed by a wolflike demonic entity at every full moon. They become near-mindless killing machines with supernatural speed, strength and ferocity. They recover from injury almost instantly, are immune to poisons as well as any kind of sorcery that attacks the mind. They can only be killed by a weapon made from silver which has been inherited‚Äînot just purchased. The curse of the loup-garou can be hereditary if the one who placed the curse specified it as such. Usually the person afflicted with the curse is aware of their condition and will have enough sense to isolate or shield themselves from society to prevent the horrible damage they would inflict on the rest of the people with the next full moon. As such, Loup-garou attacks on the populace are thankfully rare. The only one featured in the series to date is Harley MacFinn whose family curse originated from St. Patrick himself. Lycanthrope A lycanthrope is someone who is a natural channel or medium for a spirit of rage. The lycanthrope is born with this ability; it does not allow them to physically change into a wolf, but grants them a beast-like strength. When this spirit takes over, the lycanthrope becomes stronger, more aggressive, and more resistant to pain, injury and sickness. They heal wounds rapidly and tend to congregate in groups much like packs with an Alpha leader. Although harder to hurt or kill than an ordinary person, lycanthropes can be killed with ordinary weapons. In Fool Moon, Bob explains that the Norse berserkers were lycanthropes. The lycanthropes featured in the series are a biker gang known as the Streetwolves. Other shapeshifters = Listens-to-Wind = Listens-to- Wind (\\"Injun' Joe\\"), a Wizard of the White council, has also shown the ability to change shape with ease, presumably with the use of magic; he was able to change into many animals, including, but not limited to: a huge bear, a flying squirrel, and a turtle. He did this during the events of Turn Coat in order to counter the naagloshii's shapeshifting attacks, and finished the fight victorious, the injured naagloshii fleeing the battlefield howling in pain. =Skinwalker= Another kind of shapeshifter that appears in the novels is the Skinwalker in the novel Turn Coat. The skinwalker, also called the naagloshii, has the ability to change itself into an enhanced version of any animal and can use magic extensively. They are also able to perfectly mimic people, down to the retina and fingerprint level if necessary. Its true form is that of a golden-furred semi-humanoid. Naagloshii gain power by hunting magical practitioners and devouring their power; most are millennia old and thus have acquired extreme power, to the extent that even powerful wizards avoid fighting them if possible. They are, however, not invulnerable - the fugitive Warden Donald Morgan relates a tale to Dresden about an encounter with a naagloshii he had in the 1950s, which he ultimately defeated by luring it onto a government nuclear bomb testing site in Nevada, then escaping into the Nevernever seconds before the bomb detonated, killing the skinwalker. In the battle between Listens-To-Wind and the Naagloshii nicknamed \\"Shagnasty\\" by Dresden, the Skinwalker states that Listens-To-Wind cannot ' banish' him, implying that some other form of Native American magic could effectively counter the Skinwalker's power. Morgan stated that certain Native rituals could defeat Skinwalkers, but it seems that only those belonging to certain tribes can cast them; Shagnasty states Listens-To-Wind does not have the proper blood to use such magic. According to Morgan, Skinwalkers live in the tribal lands of the American Southwest and can detect when magic-users enter their territory. However, they cannot remain outside their territories for long as doing so slowly drains their magical reserves, and they must eventually return (suggesting that, unlike wizards or Faeries, a Skinwalker's ability to produce its own magical energy is severely limited, at least when outside their homelands). =Tera West= Tera, the fianc√©e of Harley MacFinn in the book Fool Moon, was seen as a supernatural being, most likely from the NeverNever, as when she looked into Harry's eyes there was no soulgaze. She was able to change form into that of a wolf at will and seemed to move much more gracefully than any other of the types of werewolf. At the end of the novel, she transformed into a wolf and joined a pack, causing Harry to surmise that she was, in fact, actually a wolf that was able to take on the form of a human, using similar means to those of a \\"classic\\" werewolf. Angels There have been several hints at Archangels in the series. The Archangel Michael is said to have given Esperacchius to Sanya, a Knight of the Cross. The Archangel Rafael (or one of his lieutenants) is said to have given power to a saferoom in the Carpenter household. The Archangel Uriel is commented on by Queen Mab; toward the end of Small Favor; she calls him \\"The Watchman\\", and refers to three other Archangels as \\"the Prince of the Host\\", \\"the Trumpeter\\", and \\"the Binder of Demons\\", presumedly Michael, Gabriel, and Raphael respectively. Uriel is described as 'Heaven's spook' by Bob. Harry also appears to be in debt to Uriel and might owe him a favor. Harry is given the power of Soulfire, the magical opposite of Hellfire, by Uriel (intimated as a reward for doing good, and to replace his lost Hellfire). In the novelette \\"The Warrior\\" Harry meets Uriel again and Uriel explains how Harry and Michael are still doing good and fighting for it, despite the fact that Michael does not wield the sword anymore. Uriel also points out that he is not supposed to be explaining these things to Harry. Uriel makes another appearance in Changes when Harry in a desperate struggle to escape from his paralysis summons him and attempts to convince Uriel to heal him. Uriel is unable to act stating he had already done all he could although he gives Harry confirmation that his daughter is actually his and is not a deception by Susan or some other entity. Uriel in this conversation reveals that he is familiar with Odin (also known as Vadderung) whom Harry had met and informed him of the Red Court's plans and the location where his daughter would be held at. Uriel leaves telling Harry \\"Whatever you do, do it for Love. If you keep to that, your path will never wander so far from the light that you can never return.\\" Uriel helps Harry Dresden complete his mission in the novel Skin Game by lending his power to Michael Carpenter both to save Harry and Murphy's lives, and to enable Michael to act as Murphy's replacement. In this state, Uriel is as vulnerable as any mortal; and Michael, while wielding Uriel's power, can cause Uriel to Fall if he acts in any way contrary to Divine Will. He is not totally helpless however, as he can still call upon his eons of experience in battle and war. One of the Archangels makes a personal appearance during the climax of Changes, appearing around Karrin Murphy as she wields the Sword of Faith, and it condemns the Red Court in the name of God before shielding her in the battle that arises. She promptly proceeds to kill one of the eldest of the Red Court and kick ass for Heaven. During Ghost Story, Harry meets up with angels acting in several capacities, including sentries, guardians for the Carpenter household, an Angel of Death (they escort to the Afterlife any worthy souls who might be attacked on the way there), and Uriel again. It is hinted that angels strongly value their relationship to the Divine; when Harry abbreviates Uriel's name by removing the syllable that means \\"god,\\" Uriel corrects him by asserting that syllable's importance while displaying barely- controlled anger and possibly fear. (The name \\"Uriel\\" is from the Hebrew meaning \\"God is my light;\\" but Harry shortens it to \\"Uri,\\" meaning simply \\"my light.\\") It is also suggested that Uriel has the power to obliterate the planet with a simple thought. Later on, when Harry comments that Uriel had the power to unmake solar systems, Uriel absently corrects him with \\"galaxies.\\" Demons There are several different types of demons in the Dresden universe. Nevernever Demons Not much has been revealed about the inner workings of these demons, except that there is a caste system, with lower demons at the bottom and older, more powerful beings at the top (sometimes referred to as gods). They must be summoned by a wizard or sorcerer using their true name to appear in this world, with two obligations to fulfill once done so: first, to attempt to escape whatever confinement may hold them, and second, to kill whoever summoned them. In appearance and ability they all resemble monsters, have some magical ability and are very strong. Like all creatures from the Nevernever they must create a body made of ectoplasm to exist in this world. If this body is destroyed, the demon is not killed but returned to the Nevernever. It is hypothesized by Bob the Skull that Fidelacchius, Esperacchius, or Amoracchius might be able to actually kill the demon through its mortal shell, though this has not yet been confirmed. Despite their strengths and the intentions of the wizards summoning them, these demons are said to be uninterested in affecting the mortal realm on their own, if they even notice at all. They also are allowed to interfere when called upon by a human. Scions Scions, like changelings, are the result of the mating of a demon (or other non-fae being of the Nevernever) and a mortal creature. These children tend to look inhuman, often disfigured or insane; even those who appear to be normal humans have an \\"inner\\" demonic form that can be seen by a wizard's Sight. As few human scions have been directly depicted in the series, it is unknown exactly what if any superhuman abilities they possess, though those scions that have been featured or mentioned are among some of the more dangerous characters. * Jared Kincaid, a mercenary and assassin for hire currently working for the Archive, was strongly implied to be a scion during Blood Rites, when Harry caught a glimpse of him with his Sight. Though Kincaid has shown no obvious supernatural powers‚Äîhis primary choice of weaponry is firearms‚Äîhe has demonstrated literally superhuman marksmanship (never missing a single shot out of dozens fired) in at least one firefight. He has also shown himself to have amazing physical strength, to the point of being able to kick down a bolted door with little sign of effort, and survived intense violence that should have killed an ordinary mortal. He was also able to identify a land mine by scent, see the beams of an infrared laser, and presumably has superhuman night vision. He is several centuries old, and has long been known as the Hound of Hell, or simply the Hellhound. He served as the right hand of Vlad Drakul. * Lucius Glau, a servant of Madrigal Raith's in Proven Guilty, was said by Thomas to be the scion of a djinn. Though mostly human in appearance, he displayed sharklike teeth and was capable of superhuman speed and ferocity as well as the ability to levitate about an inch off the ground when running, but could be injured by normal means. * Mouse, Harry's dog, has been said to be the scion of a divine guardian-dog spirit and a mortal canine, a breed called a Foo Dog. Since adopting Harry, he has demonstrated extraordinary intelligence (and a sense of humor). Mouse is also capable of seeing and effectively fighting supernatural beings, even those of great power. Also referred to as a Temple Dog, he has proven to possess several supernatural abilities in accordance with his guardian heritage, such as enhanced speed, strength, and durability, and even the Leanansidhe is cautious around him. In Changes, it is revealed that he can also talk quite fluently... if you happen to speak Dog. In Ghost Story, Uriel calls Mouse a 'little brother'. * Grendelkins, the short story Heorot reveals the existence of creatures called Grendelkins, scions of the original Grendel. They are large, vicious, overtly masculine monsters who spread their seed through raping virgins, which then tear their way out from the womb. * The original Vlad Drakul has been stated to have been the scion of a demon (referred to as a quasi-immortal), but the truth of this has not been verified in the series. * Irwin Pounder, the son of a Bigfoot and a human woman, has been described as a scion in the short stories of the Bigfoot trilogy. Erwin looks like a big human. He has great strength, immunity to diseases and recovers fast from injuries. * Goodman Grey, the son of a naagloshii and a human woman, is a shape-shifting mercenary recruited by Nicodemus Archleone in Skin Game to help break into a high-security vault in the Nevernever. Unbeknownst to Nicodemus, Harry has already hired him to disrupt the robbery at a crucial moment. The Fallen The Fallen are angels that have been cast into exile, presumably during Lucifer's fall. Unlike the Nevernever demons, they are very interested in affecting the lives of mortals, but are placed under strict limitations, capable of only tempting or possessing a willing human. The reason for this is not known, though one theory is \\"God said so\\". The Fallen most able to act in the mortal world are the Denarians. In Small Favor it is hinted that Satan himself stepped in (illegally) to help the Denarians, donating what Harry calls a \\"truly frightening amount of power\\" for their plans. To balance this transgression, Uriel 'invested' in the good guys by granting Soulfire to Harry. Order of the Blackened Denarius The Denarians are unions of a human host and one of the Fallen. Their aim is to disrupt human civilization and sow chaos, corruption and suffering among humanity. There are thirty such Fallen, each bound to a tarnished silver Roman denarius which bears its respective Fallen's sigil; the thirty denarii represent the thirty pieces of silver paid to Judas Iscariot, and may possibly be those very coins. Once a human has physically touched one of the Blackened Denarii, the Fallen bound to it is free to communicate with its new host, able to bestow knowledge, physical prowess, and magical ability, for as long as the host maintains possession of the coin. If the coin is merely touched briefly and not actually picked up, a shadow copy of the Fallen is put into the hosts mind to tempt it to pick up the coin completely and finish the bonding. It is not nearly as powerful as the original, but even this mental copy is capable of extreme power, such as casting lifelike illusions (for the possessee only). It also possesses all the knowledge of the original - a heavy temptation in itself. Once the coin is taken up, though, the shadow is no longer needed and is taken back into the Fallen. The amount of influence a Fallen chooses to exert over its host appears to vary‚Äîin the case of Ursiel, the Fallen had completely taken over the host body, and kept the host's soul tortured and trapped. In the case of Nicodemus and his Fallen, Anduriel, the two work in what appears to be a mutually beneficial partnership. It appears that the Fallen who dominate their host's soul are less powerful than those that work with their hosts. This is most likely due to the issue of free will, since the ones that deprive their hosts of it are unable to draw on as much power. In all cases, however, the free consent of the bearer is necessary to permit Fallen influence. Harry himself resisted the shadow of a fallen angel (Lasciel) for several years, drawing sparingly on its power only to ensure their mutual survival or when no other choice presented itself. This extended stay led the shadow to gain a measure of free will of its own, eventually sacrificing itself so Harry could survive a debilitating psychic attack. If the Fallen has not completely overtaken its host, it appears that the host is able to consciously free himself or herself from the influence of the Fallen, simply by abdicating the power it provides and surrendering the Denarius. In the case of Quintus Cassius, a Denarian bonded with Saluriel, Cassius surrendered the coin to Knights of the Cross to avoid execution. Sanya admits to having once been a member of the Order, carrying the coin of the Fallen Magog for five years, but he voluntarily threw it away prior to becoming a Knight of the Cross. The Knights of the Cross were founded specifically to save people from the Fallen, and will almost always become involved (often by seeming random chance) in any situation that requires confronting one or more of the Denarians. If the host of the Fallen is a wizard or magic-user of some sort, as most of those shown have been (although it is not clear if it happened before or after they became hosts), one way to be free of the Fallen is for the host to put aside magic forever and give up the coin. Several of the coins are currently in the possession of the Knights of the Cross, the Church, and/or the Venatori Umbrorum. These coins are kept in heavily warded boxes in secret locations. However, Nicodemus and others have proven themselves adept at retrieving the coins, whether by assault or treachery, making the Knights' task a never ending one. Beginning in Proven Guilty, when evidence suggested that Hellfire had been used to assault the Winter Fae's fortress of Arctis Tor, suspicion began to rise that the Denarians were in league with the \\"Black Council\\". In Small Favor, it is revealed that Nicodemus, the Denarians' de facto leader, was unaware of this, and that the ones aiding the Black Council are doing so without his approval (he personally considers the Council a threat to his own plans and in fact may be fighting against them). Currently, the most likely suspect for the Black Council's mole within the Order of the Blackened Denarius is Nicodemus's wife, Tessa, who may have stolen eleven of the thirty coins for herself and fled, abandoning Nicodemus and his followers. Nicodemus himself is aware of this treachery, but was attacked by Harry before he could act on the knowledge. Jim Butcher has said that Nicodemus is alive, and he is now terrified of Harry; in order to rid himself of the potential threat posed by Harry, Nicodemus persuaded Mab to loan him out for a supernatural vault robbery in Skin Game. Outsiders Little of the Outsiders or \\"Walkers\\" has been revealed. They are not of our world, (in the sense that the Faerie, the Gods, and the Demons are still of our world.) They badly want to get in. Mother Summer says that if they do get in, 'everything stops'. In terms of power, they're about as tough as the most powerful of the Demons or archangels, or stranger and even more powerful entities akin to Lovecraftian Great Old Ones. It takes wizards centuries to develop defenses against them and magic apparently has little effect upon them. They can be defeated by, among others, the powers of the Knights of the Cross (Michael faced and beat several of them near the end of Proven Guilty); Harry Dresden himself also faced and defeated a particularly infamous Outsider known as \\"He Who Walks Behind\\" at the age of sixteen, as part of the final confrontation with his mentor Justin DuMorne. However, according to Bob, Outsiders cannot actually be killed, only damaged sufficiently as to require long years to recover; this was confirmed in Blood Rites when He Who Walks Behind was summoned by a mortal magician and recognized Harry before escaping from the disrupted summoning ritual, promising to wreak vengeance. As Harry claims only a sketchy memory of the fight and sustained many scars both physical and metaphysical from the struggle, this impending confrontation may be the most dangerous of Harry's life. Later, Harry Dresden encounters another Walker entitled \\"He Who Walks Before\\". The fallen angel, Lasciel, has told Harry that he may possess a special power due to the timing of his birth, that could potentially grant him the capability to kill Outsiders, a deed, however, still believed to be impossible. Outsiders live beyond the Gates, outside the Nevernever, and it takes armies of Unseelie Fae constantly fighting to keep them out. Wizards are terrified of the Outsiders and of their power; however, as only mortal magic can summon an Outsider (neither vampires nor faeries can do it), the temptation to gain power can be irresistible, and the Seventh Law against Outsider summoning is unique among the Laws in that a single Senior Council member is assigned to enforce it full-time. (Though the Blackstaff of the Council, as part of his general exemption, may summon an Outsider it is yet unknown whether one has ever done so.) Their internal organization is only sketchily understood, but they appear to have a caste system which includes empires and knights. It is also known that Outsiders can possess the mind of a White Court vampire. Before his death, Vittorio Malvora had performed massive amounts of magic and put several people into submission. Lasciel also told Harry that Vittorio had been possessed with an Outsider, hence gaining the ability to do this. It is also hinted at in Blood Rites that Lord Raith might have some protection granted by the Outsiders to protect him from mortal magic. In Cold Days, it's revealed that the Outsiders have a sort of mental weapon or virus called Nemesis which can infect those in our world and turn them toward the Outsider's purposes, ultimately letting them into the Gates. Those infected will also try to kill or infect anyone who discovers Nemesis' existence, so it's considered wise not to speak its name aloud. Harry surmises that the Black Council of Wizards he suspects may be a part of the Nemesis infection. Dragons As with the Outsiders, little is known of dragons. The only dragon to have appeared so far in the Dresdenverse was met by Harry at Bianca's masquerade, in Grave Peril. It is unknown if they are beings of the Nevernever, combinations of spirit/mortal nature like vampires, or some other order of being altogether. What is known is extrapolated from things said and hinted at during the encounter in Grave Peril with the being called Ferrovax, self-identified as the eldest and strongest of his kind. As noted, Ferrovax could shapeshift into human form, and possibly other forms; Ferrovax stated that dragons \\"are what [they] wish to be.\\" According to him, the true appearance of a dragon is terrifying enough to drive a beholder to madness; even in human form, Ferrovax showed his true nature by his \\"smoking\\" an unlit cigarette. Ferrovax also demonstrated immense magical power when he casually blew Dresden off his feet using only half of Dresden's Name, and then nearly crushed him with a glance. He is either immortal or long-lived enough to make no difference (his costume at the masquerade, a Roman centurion, appeared to be a legitimate relic of Imperial Roman times). However, the scope of his claims may merit at least a degree of skepticism; Michael Carpenter has fought and slain at least one other dragon, Siriothrax, suggesting either that not all dragons are as powerful as Ferrovax, or that the abilities of a Knight of the Cross were truly formidable. Fomor Signatories to the Unseelie Accords, the Fomor are first introduced in the short story \\"Even Hand\\" with the appearance of Mag, a cantrev lord who assaults Marcone's office. They also appear in \\"Aftermath\\" kidnapping many low-level practitioners in Chicago and many major cities less than 24 hours after the end of Changes. The Fomor (according to Gard) are water-dwellers, cousins to the Jotun, seers, sorcerers and shapechangers. They are described as humanoid, tall (around seven feet) and froglike with pale skin and bulging eyes. The Formor capable of using magic have less of a \\"murphyonic field\\" than Dresden and are not impeded by running water as mortal wizards are. They have specialized weapons that shoot out acid-filled spines adapted and used in different ways similar to grenades, guns and mines (enchanted seashells serving as firebombs, for instance). When Marci is hit with a spike in \\"Aftermath\\" it dissolves a large hole into her shoulder. They are also supernaturally strong, resilient, and can both communicate and echolocate much as dolphins and bats do. In Ghost Story, it is revealed that the Fomor are now making a play to be major magical powers, kidnapping mortals to transform into minions and aiming to take over the abandoned territories of the Red Court, or those powers leaving old territories to claim Red Court lands. Their minions are called \\"Turtlenecks\\" because of their standard apparel, and Harry is told that they are old, old enemies of the Fey, a mixture of ancient gods, fallen fey, and rival spirits. Svartalves Svartalves (sg. Svartalf) are a powerful group of relatively small-sized Elves, characterized at high skills in craftmanship, a strong appreciation of beauty, a prickly susceptibility, a long memory, and a sense of honor so strong that it may be unbreakable. In Bombshells, they host a party where a neutrality treaty with the Fomor was to be signed. On a mission to rescue Thomas Raith, Molly Carpenter foils the Fomor's treachery, preventing the treaty from being signed and earning a favor from the Svartalves in the process. The Forest People The group of people to which \\"Bigfoot\\" Strength of a River in His Shoulders, or River for short, belongs to. They shy away from human civilization and are huge and hairy in appearance. They have large reservoirs of power to draw upon, a side-effect of which may be the growth of excess body hair. They are as magically gifted as most wizards of the Council, and extremely smart. However, they tend to be very careful to remain ignored by humans, and probably other creatures as well. In Skin Game, Harry encounters a creature called the Genoskwa, who he initially misidentifies as one of the Forest People. Genoskwa is infuriated by this, and attacks Harry, saying it is nothing like the \\"whimpering\\" Forest People and has nothing but contempt for River Shoulders. Like the Forest People, it has superhuman strength, speed, agility, and endurance, but it also possesses the ability to neutralize direct magical attacks, which Harry theorizes may be a novel application of earth magic.

It has entrances on two sides of the main building, an open balcony at the front fa√ßade, and a long verandah. It was conserved by Singapore's Urban Redevelopment Authority in February 2000. The house is currently part of a new residential condominium complex, \\"A Treasure Trove\\", which was completed in 2015. The fa√ßade and interior are restored and has been converted into a clubhouse.http://www.ura.gov.sg/uol/media-room/forum- replies/2013/sep/forum13-18.aspx History 250px Background The house was completed in 1902 and was built by Alexander Cashin for his wife. The house was named after Alexander's mother, Josephine Matilda Cashin, and hence the name, \\"Matilda House\\". It was a single-storey tropical-style bungalow with four bedrooms and servant-quarters attached. The house was set within a large garden with coconut and various kinds of fruit trees and also includes a horse-stable, tennis-courts and is nearby a small fishing village on the side close to the seafront. It mainly served as a weekend retreat for the Cashins. The ownership of the house was later passed on to Howard Cashin, where he resided in together with his wife and children after returning from England where he studied law in 1953. In the 1960s, the ownership was then further passed on to his brother, Joseph Cashin, where Joseph lived in along with his sister and their mother. Government acquisition Matilda House in 2006, with Soo Teck LRT station in the background. In 1985, the government acquired one million meters square of land in Punggol, including the Matilda Estate, which the house was a part of and the Cashins were asked to move out of the property. Given conservation by Singapore's Urban Redevelopment Authority status on 21 February 2000 as a reminder of the past to the residents of Punggol, the land around the building was cleared, and the house was the only building standing. Due to disuse and lack of maintenance, the house fell into ruins and inspired rumours of it being haunted and that it cannot be demolished. It was referred as \\"Ghost House\\" or Istana Menanti (The Waiting Palace). In 2010, the site which the house sits on was put on for sale. It was a frequent haunt for photographers, especially for those who want to take night shots of the place, until the site the house was sold in 2012 for redevelopment. Re-development In 2012, the site on which the house sits was sold to property developer Sim Lian Group, which planned to develop the site into a residential condominium known as \\"A Treasure Trove\\". The sale conditions included the need to conserve and restore the building and integrate it as part of the housing project. The house was eventually converted into the condominium's clubhouse in 2015 and houses amenities such as function rooms and a gym for its condominium residents. Popular culture The house was featured in a 1980s television serial, Tenko, about the experiences of British, Australian and Dutch women who were captured after the fall of Singapore in February 1942 during World War II.

The library was established on 8 November 1839 and opened on 23 November 1841, carrying on the tradition of the activity and fame of the old library of Academia VasilianƒÉ, founded in 1640. Functioning closely with Academia MihƒÉileanƒÉ, founded in 1835, it had the double character of a school library and a public library. In 1860, when the academy was transformed into the new University of Ia»ôi, the library became the Central University Library of Ia»ôi. However, its university character was soon changed again, for in 1864 the Regulation for Public Libraries transformed it into the Central State Library of Ia»ôi, with a national library profile but also playing the role of a university library. This double character continued until 1916, when the library once again assumed its current name.Kent When it opened, the University of Ia»ôi had three faculties, not counting the theological section: Law, Philosophy, and Science. Scientific and technical specialisation of the different sections within the faculties began almost at once. After several management proposals made by Dimitrie Gusti in 1913 and 1914, the library was reorganised in 1932 according to the system proposed by B. Harms and W. G√ºlich. It was once again reorganised in 1948, after World War II. This had become quite necessary, as the library's collection had increased from 600 volumes to 1,500,000. By 2007 it had an additional million volumes. Among these are manuscripts, incunabula and rare books that entered the collection from monastic and private libraries, either by donation or purchase.Official site Mihai Eminescu and Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu both served as librarians-in- chief at this institution. From its foundation until 1860, the library functioned in the building of Academia MihƒÉileanƒÉ (now destroyed). It was housed in the old university building (now the University of Medicine and Pharmacy) until 1897 and in the new university building (now the study hall of the Gheorghe Asachi Technical University of Ia»ôi) until after World War II, when it moved into the building of the King Ferdinand I Foundation's Library, the collections of which it now includes. This structure was built between 1930 and 1934 by the engineer Emil Prager following architect Constantin Jotzu's plans. The interior features Carrara marble and Venetian mosaic, while the exterior is decorated with Ionic columns, neo-Doric pilasters, small triangular pediments and medallions of important cultural figures.

The former Arctic College was split into Aurora College and Nunavut Arctic College when Nunavut Territory was created in 1999. Aurora College has campuses in Inuvik, Fort Smith and Yellowknife. It has learning centres in many other communities in the NWT. There has been an evolution of the land area which comprises the North-West Territories since it was first created in 1870. This article has some chronology of the higher education of the Northwest Territories before the separation of Nunavut in 1999. History Up to 1945, the Anglican and Roman Catholic church organizations and missions were mainly responsible for education in the Northwest Territories, with schools and nearby student residences typically being set up in higher populated towns. Starting in 1959, the federal government of Canada began programs that would see it taking more interest and involvement in the Territories' system of education. During the 1960s the government built schools in the communities where indigenous peoples had recently settled and recruited teachers to staff these new schools. By 1969, power over education was officially transferred over to the government of the Northwest Territories under its Department of Education. In 1969, the Adult Vocational Training Centre (AVTC) was established at Fort Smith.http://www.auroracollege.nt.ca/_live/pages/wpPages/AboutHistory.aspx Aurora College (n.d.). About Aurora College and our History. Retrieved on June 19, 2008 By 1977, it was made responsible for all vocational training in the Northwest Territories.Hilyer, G. M. (1997). Higher education in the Northwest Territories. In G. Jones (Ed.), Higher education in Canada: Different systems, different perspectives. New York, NY: Garland Publishing, p. 310. AVTC was officially declared a college by the Northwest Territories Legislative Assembly in 1981 and was renamed Thebacha College.Hilyer, G. M. (1997). Higher education in the Northwest Territories. In G. Jones (Ed.), Higher education in Canada: Different systems, different perspectives. New York, NY: Garland Publishing, pp. 310-311. To institute a model of education that better served the community at large and not just those requiring technical skills, Arctic College was established in 1984 in both Fort Smith and Iqaluit and grew rapidly to consist of campuses across all regions of the NWT. In 1984 the Great Slave Helicopters Flight Training Centre opened by Rodney Wood and Gabe Devenyi, which represented one of the few Yellowknife Career Colleges and Trade Schools. By 1987, it was agreed that community learning centres across the North would join the college system, a process which was completed in 1990. In 1991, Thomas Wanderlake brought an Academy of Learning College franchise to Yellowknife to offer diplomas in subjects not covered by other institutions and using an educational model that offered flexibility to the lives of Northerners. In 1995, Arctic College was divided into Aurora College in the Western Arctic, and Nunavut Arctic College in the Eastern Arctic in order to strengthen adult and post-secondary education across the North and focus on meeting community needs.Northwest Territories: Education(n.d.). The Canadian Encyclopedia Retrieved on July 05, 2008 In that same year, The Science Institute of the Northwest Territories, which was established in 1984, was split and merged by the NWT Legislative Assembly into both institutions. In 1999, The Nunavut Act reorganizes the Northwest Territories into two jurisdictions: The Northwest Territories and Nunavut. In 2001 and 2002, Aurora College implemented four literacy projects with funding from Human Resources and Social Development Canada to support increasing literacy across the territory: Northwest Territories International Adult Literacy and Skills Survey (IALSS) 2002, Family and Community Literacy Development Project, NWT Literacy Council (NWTLC) projects, and WOW!: Wonder of Words Newspaper for At- Risk Youth. In 2006, 20% or 8292.8 persons had a post secondary education out of the 41,464 residents of the Northwest Territories. Structure The territorial Department of Education, Culture and Employment is the government agency responsible for post-secondary education in the Northwest territories. They have recognized 2 post-secondary institutions: Aurora College, which has core public funding, and formerly an Academy of Learning College. A third college, Coll√®ge nordique francophone, provides education to French-speaking residents of the Territories. In addition, Great Slave Helicopters Flight Training Centre applies Global Positioning Systems training for helicopter pilot education.

Mossberg & Sons (commonly known as Mossberg) is an American firearms manufacturer, specializing in shotguns, rifles, scopes, and pistol accessories. Origins Oscar Frederick Mossberg (1866‚Äì1937) was born on 1 September 1866, in Sweden, near the village of Svanskog in V√§rmland, and emigrated to the United States in 1886.Gun Digest, The Mossberg Story, 17th Anniversary Edition, Chicago: The Gun Digest Co. (1963), pp. 120-124 Mossberg went to work at the Iver Johnson Arms & Cycle Works in Fitchburg, Massachusetts. While at Iver Johnson, Mossberg supervised the manufacture of revolvers and shotguns, while contributing some of his own patented designs, including a top strap latching mechanism for the Iver Johnson safety revolver.I. Johnson & O. Mossberg, U.S. Patent No. 511,620, Dec. 26, 1893 When Mossberg left Iver Johnson, he went on to manage the small factory of the C.S. Shattuck Arms Co. in nearby Hatfield, Massachusetts, which manufactured single- and double-barrel breechloading shotguns. From there he went to work for J. Stevens Arms & Tool Co., where he designed a small four-shot novelty pistol which he patented in his name. Working out of an old barn behind his house, Mossberg and his sons made about 500 of these four-shot pistols between 1907 and 1909. In 1914, Mossberg left Stevens, moving to New Haven, Connecticut, in order to work for Marlin-Rockwell. In 1919, when Marlin- Rockwell went out of business (they primarily made machineguns, and World War I had just ended), the unemployed 53-year-old O.F. Mossberg and his two sons, Iver and Harold, started a new firearms company of their own, O.F. Mossberg & Sons. Renting a small loft on State Street in New Haven, the Mossbergs began work on a simple four-shot .22-caliber pocket pistol, the Brownie. Marketed largely to hunters and trappers for the humane killing of wounded or trapped animals, approximately 37,000 Brownie pistols were produced from 1920 to 1932. Connecticut production Thanks to the Brownie pistol, the Mossbergs' firearms business grew steadily, and in 1921 the company purchased a building on Greene Street in New Haven, Connecticut. In 1922, the company introduced the first of a new line of .22 rimfire Mossberg rifles, a pump-action repeater designed by Arthur E. Savage, the son of the owner of Savage Arms Corp. After building a third factory in New Haven in 1937, Mossberg continued to produce simple, economical firearms for the civilian market. O.F. Mossberg died in 1937, and the business continued under his son Harold. During World War II, the company made parts for Browning M2 .50-caliber heavy machine gun and for the Enfield No. 4 rifle under contract, as well as the U.S. Model 42 and Model 44 .22 caliber bolt-action rifle, which was used for preliminary small arms training for the Army and Navy. In 1960, the company shifted production to a new facility in North Haven a few miles away. At one time, the plant employed hundreds of skilled workers, many of whom had previously worked at other well- known firearms manufacturers such as Colt's Manufacturing Company, Marlin Firearms, Smith & Wesson, and Winchester. O.F. Mossberg & Sons remains a family-owned business to this day, and is the oldest family-owned firearms manufacturer in America. Today, while the corporate headquarters are still in North Haven, the company has moved nearly all firearms production to its Eagle Pass, Texas, facility in response to new firearms legislation, and has reduced its North Haven workforce accordingly.Haar, Dan, Upbeat Gun Industry Numbers Mask Deep Turmoil A Year After Law, The Hartford Courant, 6 April 2014 Maverick Arms In 1989, faced with increased foreign competition and rising labor and production costs, Mossberg's corporate affiliate Maverick Arms opened a manufacturing plant in the Eagle Pass Industrial Park in the state of Texas. The Eagle Pass production facility was greatly enlarged in 2013 to help production and warehousing keep up with demand. With the addition of of factory space, Mossberg also expanded its Texas workforce to 450 employees.Miniter, Frank, America's Largest Shotgun Maker Shifts More Jobs to Texas, Forbes Magazine online, 11 July 2014 Today, over 90% of all O.F. Mossberg & Sons shotguns and rifles are produced at the Eagle Pass facility. Production history Mossberg .22 caliber post-war rifles Mossberg Silver Reserve O/U Shotgun 12ga with extended chokes Following the success of the Brownie .22 pistol, Mossberg developed a line of inexpensive .22 caliber rifles, shotguns, and rifle scopes.O.F Mossberg - A brief history of the early years From the 1940s through the 1960s, Mossberg produced a HI line of .22 caliber target and sporting rifles. After the end of World War II, Mossberg concentrated on producing sporting long guns for the entry-level sportsman, particularly shotguns. Most of these were bolt-action or pump-action designs. In August 1961, Mossberg introduced the 500 Series pump-action shotgun, which eventually became one of the most-produced sporting firearms in the world, with over ten million shotguns sold.> Designed by Carl Benson, Mossberg's lead design engineer, the 500 was originally intended for use by the entry-level hunter and sportsman but has since become popular for home defense use as well. Using a forged aluminum receiver and steel bolt that locks into a steel extension of the barrel to save weight, the gun was designed with a minimum of parts that could be produced easily with a minimum of machining required and which could be installed without hand-fitting. Variants of the basic Mossberg 500 shotgun have been adopted for use by the U.S. military as well as law enforcement. Mossberg offers bolt-action, lever-action and auto-loading rifles as well as pump-action, auto-loading, and over/under shotguns. Manufacturing is done both in Turkey and in the USA from parts made in both America and Mexico. In January 2019, the company introduced the MC1sc, a subcompact semi- automatic pistol chambered in 9√ó19mm Parabellum, Mossberg's first handgun offering since the Brownie was introduced 100 years prior.

These pharmacophores can be overlaid and superimposed using a pattern-matching based alignment algorithm that is solely based on pharmacophoric feature points instead of chemical structure. From such an overlay, shared features can be interpolated to create a so-called shared-feature pharmacophore that shares all common interactions of several binding sites/ligands or extended to create a so-called merged-feature pharmacophore.

Although the series is loosely based on Shakespeare's original play many characters that were based on Shakespeare's original characters in Romeo & Juliet have gone through drastic changes concerning personality, relationships, role in the story and final outcome. Main characters ; : The protagonist of the series. Juliet Fiammata Arst De Capulet is the last member of the Capulet family and Romeo's wife. She disguises herself as a boy, Odin, in order to avoid being caught by the usurping House of Montague, who still actively look for the Capulets. An excellent swordsman, she also masquerades as a vigilante, the Red Whirlwind, in order to aid the people oppressed by the rival Montagues. She unwittingly falls in love with Romeo, which leads to several complications for her. The Capulet house has a dark secret. Escalus, the tree which holds Neo Verona in the air, is dying; the daughters of the Capulet family are the seeds of the tree and thus must sacrificially merge with it in order to save the world. Juliet does that when she finds out Romeo is dying after being stabbed by Ophelia, and holds him in her arms and merges with the Escalus, descending the floating island of Neo Verona on the ground level as well in the process. : In the series, Juliet is presented as a strong and intelligent young woman, she is loving, with a strong sense of justice and determination to lead the Capulet faction against the oppression of the corrupt Lord Montague. She falls deeply in love with Romeo and is stricken with the decision of being with Romeo or destroying Lord Montague. In the original play, Juliet is shown as a sheltered, innocent and emotional young woman who immediately falls in love with Romeo when she meets him and does not care that he is a Montague. Her series counterpart backs away from Romeo after learning who he is, despite having fallen deeply in love with him, but eventually gets over it and marries Romeo in episode 11. ; : The hero of the series. Romeo Candore De Montague is the son of Lord Leontes Montague and Lady Portia, heir to the throne of Neo Verona and Juliet's husband. For political reasons, he has been forced into an unwanted engagement with Hermione, a young and innocent noblewoman. As a nobleman, he rides and owns a white dragon steed named Cielo whom he later freed. In contrast to his father, he is obedient and kindhearted, often disapproving of his family's tyranny. He is ostracized by the nobility save for his friend, Benvolio. He falls in love with Juliet at first sight. At the end after the battle against Montague, Romeo along with Juliet's allies free Juliet from Escalus but is fatally stabbed by Ophelia. When he dies, Juliet decides to merge with Escalus, whilst holding Romeo in her arms so she can save Neo Verona and uphold her vow to Romeo. : In the series, Romeo is the crown prince of Neo Verona, and a confident, polite young man. He has little respect for his Montague heritage because of his father's tyranny. Unlike his counterpart in the source material, Romeo first encounters Juliet at a party hosted by his family, whereas in the play, he had secretly gone to a Capulet party in hopes of seeing Juliet's cousin, Rosaline, who he believed he was in love with before meeting Juliet. He holds nothing against the Capulet family and falls in love with Juliet, wishing only for them to be happy and safe, even going as far as marrying her in episode 11. Montagues ; : Leontes Van De Montague is the ruthless, tyrannical, Machiavellian Prince of Neo Verona. He, an illegitimate Capulet offspring, and his mother (a prostitute) were born and raised into poverty. The death of his mother sparks his unrelenting and ferocious grudge against the Capulet name and his ambitions for being Duke. He acts coldly to all around him, only seeming to care about the Great Tree Escalus. His main goal in the series is to find Lord Capulet's surviving child and kill her before the people still loyal to the Capulets can rebel. He is determine to have Romeo follow in his footsteps, though he doesn't find out till later in the series that he has another son, Tybalt, who is also a Capulet. Leontes is killed by a mad Mercutio, moments before surrendering to Juliet, admitting that he has never been loved. His given name, Leontes, is also shared by the main character of Shakespeare's The Winter's Tale. : In the play, Lord Montague is only a minor character appearing in only a few scenes of the play. While present, he is shown as being a caring and overprotective father to his son, showing no interest in destroying the Capulets but desiring for them to leave the Montagues alone instead. In the series, he is shown as the main antagonist and acts as Duke of Neo Verona instead of just being the head of his own household. ; : Portia Clemenzia de Ebe is Romeo's mother, who reluctantly left him and the Montague name to live at a convent to avoid associating herself with the bloody and cruel ambitions of her husband. She is a kind, intelligent and understanding woman who prays for Romeo's happiness. Giving him Cielo as a present when she left. Her name is possibly derived from the clever and wealthy heiress of The Merchant of Venice and the wife of Brutus from Shakespeare's Julius Caesar. : Romeo's mother is known only as Lady Montague in the original play and appears only a few scenes; she is depicted as an over-protective and loving mother who dies of heartbreak when she learns of her son's banishment before the end of the play. In the series, Lady Montague is named Portia and remains a loving mother who wishes for her son's happiness; however, she holds no loyalty to the Montagues, when she saw how power-mad he was, and harbors no hostility to the Capulet faction, and shows sympathy and kindness to Juliet. ; : Benvolio de Frescobaldi is one of Romeo's close friends. He is the son of the mayor of Neo Verona and one of the few people concerned with Romeo's well- being. He often acts as Romeo's voice of reason and moderation. He and his family are later stripped of their nobility and go into hiding with the help of Juliet and her friends. Late in the series, he falls in love with, and weds Cordelia. During the epilogue to the last episode, Benvolio and Cordelia are seen with their newborn baby. : Benvolio's character has changed little in the adaptation and remains a level-headed and well-mannered friend to Romeo. However, he is not Romeo's cousin and a member of the Montague family, like in the play. ; : Vittorio di Frescobaldi is Benvolio's father, leader of the House of Frescobaldi and mayor of Neo Verona, and an old friend of Conrad's, who held reservations concerning Montague's rule. He was a member of the moderate faction of the Montague dictatorship, with a large amount of administrative authority as the mayor of Neo Verona. He is later stripped of his title and nobility and even slated for assassination by Lord Montague, for allowing the Red Whirlwind to create civil discontent throughout Neo Verona. He is reestablished as the mayor at the end of the story. ; : An ambitious and sly noble who wishes to become Leontes's heir due to his apparent resentment of his father. He is contemptuous of the common people. Late in the series, he is adopted as Leontes's new heir but is unprepared for the bloody initiation, whose climax was Titus' death at the hands of Leontes. His inability to act in his father's defense traumatizes him and later leads to insanity. He acts as a spy for Lord Montague to unearth why Romeo is acting oddly and is trying to ensure that Leontes will disown his son for loving Juliet so he can become Leontes's heir. Despite showing a degree of loyalty to Romeo, he only shows it in order to weasel up to Leontes. After Leontes slays his father in a duel for blackmailing him, he accepts Mercutio as his new heir but the condition causes him to go hysterical, leading him to stab Leontes as Juliet and Tybalt command their surrender. : In the play, Mercutio is not Romeo's rival but his and Benvolio's mutual best friend and acts as a reckless free spirited jokester, who truly cares for Romeo but lets his own hot- bloodedness override his weariness of the feud ('A plague on both your houses!'). ; : Mercutio's father who is an alcoholic degenerate of the court. He earned his position by secretly ordering the assassinations of nearly everyone with knowledge of Leontes's origins. But when Romeo is exiled to the countryside, Titus arrogantly blackmails Leontes to make Mercutio his new heir if he doesn't want his past to be revealed. For betraying him, Leontes kills Titus in a duel while claiming his death was accidental. Three characters in Shakespeare's plays have the name \\"Titus\\", the most well-known being the title character of the violent Titus Andronicus. ; : Hermione Borromeo is a young noblewoman who is betrothed to Romeo in a political marriage at the Rose Ball. Sweet, sheltered and gentle, she appears to be genuinely in love with him though he doesn't reciprocate her feelings for him. However, she's also very passive-aggressive, having the tendency to keep her negative feelings or thoughts to herself, only to unleash them later. She holds a hatred for Juliet, however, upon meeting Juliet and seeing her genuine love for Romeo and compassion for herself, Hermione comes to be at peace with her. Hermione seems to be a stand-in for Count Paris from the play, though she is female and is a Montague ally. Hermione could also be lifted from Shakespeare's The Winter's Tale; the Hermione of that play is entangled in a conflict over adultery. Capulets ;Lord Capulet („Ç≠„É£„Éî„É•„É¨„ÉÉ„Éà) ; : Lord Capulet was Juliet's father. Along with his family (excluding Juliet), he was killed in Lord Montague's coup d'√©tat fourteen years before the story starts, as a part of Montague's scheme to take over Neo Verona and achieve revenge on the whole Capulet clan for the suffering and pain he and his mother went through for them. Although Lord Capulet was only seen at the beginning of the series before he was murdered by Lord Montague, he was mentioned several times by other characters. : He was depicted as being a kind, wise and fair ruler over Neo Verona, before the murder of his family. In the original play Lord Capulet and his wife live through the entire play; while present, he appears as a loving father to Juliet, though he also acts stubborn and controlling. At the end of the play, he makes peace with Montague after the death of his daughter and son-in-law. ;Cordelia („Ç≥„Éº„Éá„Ç£„É™„Ç¢) ; : Juliet's best friend since childhood and another survivor of the Capulet massacre (along with Curio and Francisco, her relatives worked as Capulet vassals and died in the slaughter along with their masters), she has helped take care of Juliet since then and also acts as her private confidante. Juliet relates that the reason why she kept her hair long -rather than cut it for an easier boy-like appearance- was because Cordelia liked it that way as servants often can't relish the luxury of cosmetics. She has been hinted to have feelings for Romeo's friend, Benvolio, and agrees to marry him later in the series. She hands her wedding bouquet to Juliet, wishing for her friend's and Romeo's happiness. At the end of the series, she and Benvolio have a child. ;Conrad („Ç≥„É≥„É©„ÉÉ„Éâ) ; : Captain of the Capulet Guards who saved Juliet and Cordelia from death fourteen years ago. Now a priest, he looks after Juliet, though he is exasperated by her antics. It is Conrad who reveals to Juliet her secret heritage on the day of her sixteenth birthday when he presents to her the sword of the House of Capulet. He fights with a sword in battle. He later acts as the de-facto leader of the Capulet faction, planning an assassination attempt on Lord Montague (he wants to only kill the Duke so that less blood is spilled); however, after being betrayed by his old friend Camio, he is injured in a Montague raid against the Capulet supporters. Since his escape, he has been under the care of Ariel. When he recovers, he presents the Capulet family sword to Juliet again, reviving her resolve for the Capulet's cause. When Juliet disappears after Montague's defeat, he orders Francisco and Curio to search for her. He is evacuated from the castle during the battle for Juliet. During the finale, he tends to an iris flower memorial with Antonio, wondering if his past actions with Juliet were fair. ;Antonio („Ç¢„É≥„Éà„Éã„Ç™) ; : Conrad's grandson, introduced as a young boy at the beginning of the series. He participates in the Red Whirlwind's heroic acts as a sidekick and helper, and works in William's theatre. He is one of the few living with Juliet that did not know her identity or gender until it is revealed to him on her 16th birthday. His arsenal of choice revolves around trickery including various bombs and firecrackers. After the formation of the new Capulet faction, Antonio works as a spy and helps Curio and Francisco rescue Juliet when she is captured by Montague. He has a crush on Regan. At the end of the series, he is shown as a young adult, assured that Juliet wanted everyone to be happy. ;Francisco („Éï„É©„É≥„Ç∑„Çπ„Ç≥) ; : Childhood friend of Curio and the more intellectual of the duo. He believes that Juliet is being protected by Neo Verona itself and is himself a ladies' man who enjoys teasing the more reserved Curio. He is an expert at archery and other various thrown weapons. Sneaky and sly, he managed to contact Tybalt so he could take Juliet to safety when the Montague faction discovered their hideout. He escapes and later joins Curio to rescue Juliet from Montague. Out of all of Juliet's comrades, he is the one who openly vouches for Romeo's love for Juliet. Curio later suspects if Francisco has concealed feelings for Juliet, but he dodged the questions by affirming his loyalty to the Capulets. During their later night assault against one of the enemy posts, he confesses to having \\"friends\\" with information. Along with Curio, he assisted clearing a Romeo path to the crumbling Escalus. Years later, he shown again as an active member of Neo Verona's parliament. ;Curio („Ç≠„É•„É™„Ç™) ; : A close friend of Francisco and a skilled swordsman who had lost the use of his right eye. He is also Juliet's fencing teacher, and according to him, a sword reflects the soul of its owner. His preferred weapons are axes or polearms. His scarred visage originated from protecting a younger rebellious Juliet from receiving punishment from members of the Carabinieri. Though he blames his own foolhardiness for the blow, Juliet's frustration from that time gave birth to her alter ego, The Red Whirlwind. : After the Montague raid against the Capulet supporters, he goes into hiding until Juliet is captured. When he and Francisco go to rescue her, he convinces Juliet that her life is worth saving. Later it is hinted in episode 16 that he may have romantic feelings toward Juliet. However, like Francisco, he too helped Romeo reach Juliet in her final moments. After Juliet's sacrifice, he settles down as a grocer of his own vegetable store. ;Tybalt („ÉÜ„Ç£„Éú„É´„Éà) Tiboruto ; : A mysterious warrior who aids the Capulet retainers, he tells them about the planned assassination of Benvolio's family and later aids them on his own dragon steed mounted in war gear. It is later revealed that he has a network of paid spies and informants throughout Neo Verona and that he has no qualms about killing. Tybalt is also one of the few outside the circle of Capulet retainers who knows both Juliet's secret as the last of the Capulets and her persona as the Red Whirlwind. Conrad may know the true scope of Tybalt's identity, but is still unsure. : Tybalt's mother was tricked by Romeo's father, who abandoned her when he got her pregnant and married Romeo's mother. That means Tybalt is Montague illegitimate son/Romeo's half brother. For his mother's sake, he has sworn to hate and avenge her by killing the Prince of Neo Verona. : In the original play Tybalt was presented as a hot-headed and arrogant young man with a fierce loyalty to the Capulets who is eventually killed in combat with Romeo after killing Mercutio. In the series, he is presented as more of an anti-hero with a much calmer disposition acting as a supporter to the Capulet rebels but with his own motives. Other characters ; : An actress infatuated with Juliet's disguise, Odin. Pretty and youthful, she invites Odin as Juliet to the Rose Ball where Juliet meets Romeo for the first time. She remains unaware of Odin's true identity until much later in the series. Her name may be a reference to several characters in Shakespeare's plays, including Othello, The Winter's Tale, and The Two Noble Kinsmen. ; ; : A mysterious woman who tends to the Great Tree Escalus. She has a sad, doll- like face with strange marks on her forehead and cheeks, and speaks in a rather polite and mysterious manner. Her true identity is never revealed, but it is implied that she is the physical human form of Escalus, as whenever the tree further rots, so does she. She also appears to be ageless as she looks the same as she did fourteen years ago. She reveals that since Montague's reign over Neo Verona began, the Great Tree Escalus has been slowly decaying, particularly since its companion tree died when Montague took the throne. When Juliet is captured by Montague, she encounters Ophelia during her escape; Ophelia plants within Juliet the means to save Neo Verona, though at the cost of Juliet's life. She mortally wounds Romeo shortly before being vanquished by him. Her name is likely a nod to the heroine of Shakespeare's famous tragedy, Hamlet. ; : Conrad's good friend who betrayed him by giving information regarding the Capulets' hideout to the Montagues. He is later found by Juliet, Francisco, and Curio to be in luxurious housing alongside a disgruntled Tybalt, whom he helped to raise. After being threatened by the latter, he flees from his mansion. Camilo's name is likely a nod to the character from The Winter's Tale, a character who defected from his liege King Leontes after Camilo was ordered to kill King Polixenes. ; : A sickly young man who works in one of the Montagues' mines. He has contempt for Romeo at first, and after Romeo saves him from being crushed, the two men eventually become friends. Originally sent to the mines for stealing bread for his starving family, he is desperate to serve his sentence and return to Neo Verona because his younger brother and sister are still there. Petruchio dies from illness, albeit peacefully after Romeo promises to give his siblings a ride on his dragon steed, which leaves Romeo visibly distraught. After Montague's death and his self banishment from Neo Verona, Romeo asks Tybalt to find and care for Petruchio's siblings. Petruchio's name is likely a nod to the character from The Taming of the Shrew, one of Shakespeare's early comedies. Petruchio also is the name of a ghost character in Romeo and Juliet, identified as a Capulet and a companion of Tybalt. ; : A miner who looks out for Romeo during his stay at the mines. While he admires Romeo's idealistic dream of creating a world where people can live together without sacrifices, Giovanni also believes that Romeo has chosen a long and difficult path to pursue. He often acts as a leader for the village in Romeo's absence. His name is possibly a reference to the poet Giovanni Battista Giraldi, who authored works that provided the plots for Shakespeare's Measure for Measure and Othello. ; : A mysterious yet sage man who frequently smokes from a long pipe, he is suggested, like Ophelia, to bear some connection to Escalus. He acts as Romeo's spiritual adviser, mentioning that the noble will have to someday shoulder Juliet's fate. The Old Man is possibly an allusion to Friar Lawrence, a character with somewhat similar motivations. ; Balthazar ; : Balthasar is the owner of a villa in Mantua. He welcomed Juliet and her followers into his villa for a brief period of time. ; Regan ; : Regan is Balthasar's granddaughter. She is a serious girl who is a little bossy and shares many similar attributes to Hermione. She likes to be treated like a girl and has a talent for acting. ; : William de Farnase, a flamboyant playwright whose works have not been well- received by audiences. He's nicknamed \\"Willy\\" by his actors and stagehands. He allows Juliet and her entourage to use his theater for shelter. He knows that Juliet is deeply and painfully in love, calling her \\"the maiden who gave up on love\\", and wants to make a play based on tragedy where both lovers die. The character itself is a caricature of William Shakespeare.

Bacoor Bay is on the left center of the picture. The Cavite Peninsula is a peninsula extending northeast into Manila Bay from the coastal town of Noveleta in Cavite province in the Philippines. The northern tip of the peninsula is geographically the northernmost part of the Province of Cavite. The peninsula is composed of the City of Cavite with a tiny southern portion part of the Municipality of Noveleta. The northernmost portion of the peninsula, called Sangley Point, was the location of the former U.S. Naval Station Sangley Point until 1971 when it was turned over to the Philippine government. It is now called the Danilo Atienza Air Base, a Philippine Air Force base. __TOC__  Geography  The Cavite peninsula (lower left) in relation to the City of Manila (upper middle). The peninsula is shaped like a human left hand starting from about the middle of the forearm with fingers forming a letter 'C'. Ca√±acao Bay is the body of water formed by the C-shaped upper peninsula. The thumb area was the historic old Port City of Cavite, the sister city and main seaport of the City of Manila. Because of deeper waters than the Port of Manila that was then located along the banks of Pasig River, the Port of Cavite became the staging and receiving area for the Manila galleon trade from 1565‚Äì1815. The port city used to be an island connected by a causeway to Barangay San Roque as seen from the picture above and the map to the left. The land along the causeway was reclaimed in the late 1960s, and is now occupied by the San Sebastian College-Recoletos de Cavite. The tip of the thumb, known as the Cavite Punta or Cavite Point, was the location of the old Spanish shipyard where galleons were built. It later became Cavite Navy Yard during the American colonial rule. The Spanish Navy Yard at the Cavite Point in 1899, a year after the Americans took over. Bacoor Bay is the enclosed body of water formed by the eastern shore of the peninsula, starting from the tip of the thumb (Cavite Point), circling to mainland Cavite province, continuing to the northern tip of Burunggoy Island (now Island Cove Hotel & Leisure Park).  Jurisdiction  The present and larger City of Cavite has jurisdiction over most of the peninsula. Only a tiny portion at the southernmost part belongs to the Noveleta Municipality. The Barangay Dalahican of Cavite City is the first settlement of the city from Noveleta while Barangay San Rafael IV is the last barangay of Noveleta. Barangay San Rafael IV is separated from Barangay Santa Isabel of Kawit town, by the Grande River (Rio Grande of Cavite), also known as the San Juan River (incorrectly named as Ylang-ylang River on Google Maps). The location of the mouth of Grande River in Noveleta and where Kawit ends on the river, is technically the start of the peninsula, at the average tide level.  Northernmost point  The northernmost point of the Cavite Peninsula is also the northernmost point of the Province of Cavite located at the northern tip of the Danilo Atienza Air Base (Sangley) (). For comparison, it is at the same latitude as the Para√±aque Cathedral () directly located to the east of the northernmost point, about further north than the northernmost point of Cavite mainland located near the mouth of Zapote River ().  Accessibility  Only one two-lane road, San Juan Road, connects the peninsula and its communities to mainland Cavite. A faster alternative to the peninsula from Manila is the regular ferry service between the Cavite City Ferry Terminal behind the City Hall and the port near the SM Mall of Asia in Pasay City, a direct distance of about , linking the city to Metro Manila. The trip, which started on August 20, 2007, takes about 40 minutes compared to about 2 to 2.5 hours by land.

Located on the foot of Mount Carmel, near Haifa, it falls under the jurisdiction of Hof HaCarmel Regional Council. In it had a population of . History The village was established following the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War when 35 members of the Abu al- Hija family from the depopulated village of Ayn Hawd (now Ein Hod) returned to the village lands after being released from an Israeli prisoner of war camp, refused to leave the area and settled on the village lands. They established a new village. Initially the Israeli approved name given to the village by locals was Kfar Abu al-Hija. In 1978 the villagers were able to reclaim the name Ein Hawd. Attempts to dislodge them did not succeed, and they were eventually granted Israeli citizenship. Initially, the new village was not recognized, but in 1988 it joined the Association of Unrecognized Arab Villages in Israel and was recognized by the state in 1992. In 2005, Ein Hawd achieved full recognition, including connection to the Israeli electric grid. In 1978 the village began removing the fence that Israeli authorities had surrounded the village with in 1964, to build 24 new houses. The Markovitch Commission report banded all buildings in Ein Houd as \\"grey\\" which froze all repairs to the village housing stock. Since Ein Hawd was recognized by the Israeli government, the village has joined the Hof HaCarmel Regional Council and urban planning is under way. In an interview, the village's mayor, Mohammed Abu al-Hija, was hopeful that these changes would be for the better: \\"It is true that many years have gone by, but this is a great achievement for everyone, a big step forward. The State of Israel has finally applied a policy of equality to us and I am hopeful that this will prove to be the case for other villages that are in similar situations as well...It helps to convince me that equality is attainable, no matter how difficult it may seem.\\" File:Atlit 1932.jpgEin Hawd (Ein Haud) 1932 1:20,000 File:Jaba 1945.jpgEin Hard (Ein Haud) 1945 1:250,000 One Land In 2004, the Foundation for Achieving Seamless Territory (FAST) FAST organized an international architecture and design competition for the development of an alternative master plan for Ein Hawd.Land Two Systems More than 100 plans from more than 30 countries were received.

Developed and enforced by the White Council, a fictional co-operative of magic Practitioners, the Laws of Magic are primarily intended to guard against the misuse of magic by wizards against humans. The White Council openly apply the Seven Laws on any person capable of doing magic, despite admitting only the most powerful practitioners to their ranks. Overview In the Dresdenverse, the use of magic in a way which causes harm can be a corrupting influence. Practitioners who regularly cause harm through magic become twisted by the experience, gradually growing more power-hungry and insane, until there is no spark of humanity left in them. Wizards who do so are termed Warlocks. Violating any of the Laws carries the death penalty, most often administered by a Warden of the White Council as decapitation by sword. Wardens are the enforcement arm of the Council, tasked with patrolling and protecting the wizard world. The Doom of Damocles In some instances a form of probation, the Doom of Damocles, is rendered instead. Under the Doom, a wizard is openly under the suspicion and scrutiny of the White Council and any further infractions will automatically warrant execution. A wizard under the Doom may be assigned to the custody of another wizard; in the case of another infraction, both wizards are killed. It is stated on a number of occasions throughout the series that the Doom of Damocles is rarely invoked, with most Warlocks being quickly executed after a brief trial and guilty verdict. The Blackstaff The Blackstaff is a member of the White Council who has the discretion of being able to break the Laws as he or she sees fit in order to prevent them from becoming a liability against the White Council. The existence of this position, and the power it carries, are not commonly known pieces of information. The person holding the title has the right to violate any of the Laws of Magic, if he deems it to be necessary. The office comes with an artifact, the titular Blackstaff, which is implied in the books to absorb the negative effects of breaking the Laws, allowing the wielder to remain sane despite his or her use of black magic. The Laws of Magic The baseline laws are listed (not in order) in a conversation between the characters Ebenezar McCoy and Harry Dresden in the novel Blood Rites when McCoy discusses his title and position of Blackstaff to Harry. They are: The First Law of Magic The first law prohibits the killing of humans with magic. A plea of self-defense is allowed in mitigation, though it seems to work only rarely. Wardens often wield swords when detaining and executing warlocks to avoid a technical infraction of this Law. At several points in the series, however, Wardens have used lethal magic against human wizards; the Wardens are given some latitude. The use of magic to kill non-human beings, on the other hand, is lawful; a wizard may, for example, use magic to kill a ghoul, a vampire or any being of the Nevernever without breaking this Law. The Second Law of Magic This law prohibits the shape shifting of other beings. To forcefully shapeshift another being would be to erase memory and personality which is considered as good as murder. See also shapechangers. The Third Law of Magic This law prohibits the forcible violation of a mortal [human]'s mind. This includes everything from mind reading to mental rape. During an attempt on his mind (by the Corpsetaker, in Dead Beat), Harry makes the comment that because of its outlaw status, training to resist such invasions is very basic because of a lack of people with skill in this area to train against. Sending mental messages is not in itself a violation of this. The Fourth Law of Magic This law prohibits the magical domination of another being's mind. Enthrallment is the term used in the books for this. The difference between the third and fourth law can be subtle. The fourth law forbids altering desires and emotions in ways that will change what people want, rather than what they think is true (which would be a violation of the third law to accomplish a similar result). In the first book, Storm Front, it is stated twice that this law applies to the binding of non-humans as well (in contrast to the other laws). This is contradicted in Turn Coat, when the hit man Binder is introduced; Binder is somewhat notorious for his ability to summon a tribe of beings that he has bound to his will, but it is also stated that \\"he is careful not to break any of the laws.\\" The Fifth Law of Magic This Law prohibits both research into and the practice of necromancy, described as the summoning, binding and exploitation of the unwilling dead. The Law applies specifically to human necromancy, but the Wardens (and, by implication, the rest of the Council) still frown upon any form of the practice. Communicating with spirits of the dead who are willing to do so is stated not to be a violation of this law. The Sixth Law of Magic This law prohibits any attempt to \\"swim against the currents of time\\"; any attempt to change the past through temporal manipulation for fear of paradoxes. Even magical prediction is stated in the books to be frowned upon except in the vaguest, most general forms. It is noted however, that some beings in the Dresdenverse exist in the past, present, and future at once, and that such beings can be dangerous for this reason. It is also stated that paradox is \\"an overrated threat\\" due to a property of temporal inertia that gives events a strong tendency to occur the way they already have once, regardless of interference. The Seventh Law of Magic This law prohibits wizards from researching or dealing with Outsiders, beings from beyond the boundaries of the known universe. Appearances The seven laws as a whole have been mentioned in every novel in the series so far, however not all of the laws have been expounded upon or explained in detail. Numerous incidents involving them have occurred throughout the run of the series. In a number of the books, it is discussed how Harry was accused of breaking the first law when he killed Justin DuMorne, his former teacher, in self-defense. This is the incident that resulted in Harry being placed under the Doom of Damocles, as explained in Storm Front. In Dead Beat, Harry's narration reveals that members of the White Council are poorly prepared to defend themselves against psychic assaults as a result of the third law. This would later become a plot point in Turn Coat Molly Carpenter was charged with breaking the fourth law in Proven Guilty. She accepts to appear before the Council and is placed under the Doom of Damocles under Dresden's guidance; much like Dresden was placed under Ebenezer McCoy's guidance. According to a conversation between Elaine and Harry in Summer Knight, DuMorne had enthralled Elaine completely, and was planning on enthralling Harry, as well. In Storm Front, Harry is (briefly and flippantly) accused by Morgan of violating the fourth law after Dresden used a magic circle to trap and blackmail a faerie into giving him information he needed to solve the case. Dresden points out that the law was not broken, as the faerie always had the option of refusing and remaining trapped in the circle, later, he frees a demon from enthrallment without establishing control of his own, specifically because it would be against the fourth law to do so. This is noteworthy because the Laws Of Magic are stated in Dead Beat, to exclusively be for the protection of mortals. Information gleaned from Bob in Dead Beat recounts the death of Kemmler, a powerful necromancer who had engineered both world wars in order to provide himself with a fresh supply of human corpses. According to the book, the entire White Council (not just the Wardens) banded together to hunt him down and kill him, twice. Harry notes that Black Court vampires are vulnerable to necromancy in an unspecified fashion, though it is not explained in the books if such use would constitute a breaking of the Law. Harry exploits a loophole in the fifth law in order to defeat a group of necromancers in Dead Beat. The sixth law is mentioned a number of times, but not much is explained about it. It is stated that predicting the future is frowned upon, except for the most vague and nebulous of predictions. In Cold Days, Harry Dresden visits the Outer Gates with Mother Summer, where it is revealed that the Outer Gates are literally a pair of gates located on a wall that spans the outer boundaries of the Winter Court's territory in the faerie realm. They are implied to be the furthest limit of the universe, and bar the Outsiders from entering this universe. They are defended by millions, possibly billions of Unseelie Fae who wage constant war against the Outsiders. They are aided by some Seelie Fae medics, and the Gatekeeper, who helps protect the Gates from breaches from this universe by enforcing the Seventh Law, and he coordinates efforts with other trusted factions. The Dresden Files RPG has expanded upon this law in its publications, establishing that is illegal to attempt to even learn anything about what lies beyond the Outer Gates, though it acknowledges that there is obviously some grey area here or the Wardens wouldn't know what to look for. In Summer Knight, Harry is introduced to The Gatekeeper, one of the Senior Council. The Gatekeeper's job is to aid the forces of the Winter Fae in defending the universe from the Outsiders, and it is often suggested that this law does not apply to him to the same extent as it does to other wizards. It is stated in Ghost Story that DuMorne had broken the seventh law when he summoned one of the Outsiders to kill Harry.

The stained glass studio was founded in the Mott Alley section of downtown Los Angeles in the mid-1890s by English-born artist William Lees Judson and his three sons. It moved to its current location in 1920 and remains in operation as a family-run business. The Judson Studios building was named a Historic- Cultural Landmark by the City of Los Angeles in 1969 and listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1999.  Founder William Lees Judson  William Lees Judson was born in 1842 in Manchester, England, and moved to the United States with his parents when he was ten years old. After serving four years with the Illinois volunteers during the American Civil War, Judson studied art in New York and Paris. He settled in London, Ontario, where he became a successful portrait painter and art teacher. He moved to Chicago in 1890 but, suffering from failing health, he moved to Los Angeles in 1893. He settled on the banks of the Arroyo Seco in the Garvanza section of Los Angeles and became part of an influential scene of artists in the Arroyo. A 1937 radio program noted that it was \\"love at first sight\\" when Judson saw the Arroyo Seco, and the area became his home for the rest of his life. Soon after his arrival, Judson was at the forefront of the Arroyo Guild of Craftsmen, a group of artists, sculptors and architects who fueled Southern California's Arts and Crafts Movement. The beauty of the area stirred Judson to switch from portrait painting to landscapes, and his work attracted such favorable attention that in 1896 he was offered a professorship in drawing and painting at the University of Southern California. In the late 1890s, he founded the Los Angeles College of Fine Arts at his home in Garvanza (the present location of Judson Studios). He died at his home in the studio building in October 1928. Oil painting by William Lees Judson of Avalon Beach in late 19th century California, the United States of America.  Formation of Judson Studios  Judson Studios logo mosaic After settling in Los Angeles, William Lees Judson saw the need for a local stained glass studio. In 1895, he persuaded three of his sons, Walter H., Lionel and Paul, to come to Los Angeles to join him in starting a stained glass studio. The family initially opened its stained glass business under the name Colonial Art Glass Co., in Mott Alley, located near the Old Plaza and Union Station in an area that was later demolished for the construction of the Hollywood Freeway. In the studios' early years, its stained glass output was \\"balanced between religious and secular, between recreating the Gothic effect and working for Frank Lloyd Wright in glass and tile on the Ennis and Barnsdall Houses.\\" In addition to stained glass, the Judsons also worked in tile and mosaic. The Judson operation became so highly regarded that it was able to recruit such major artists as A.E. Brain and Frederick Wilson away from America's premiere maker of stained glass, Louis Comfort Tiffany.  College of Fine Arts  Judson started as a professor at McLeod's Los Angeles School of Art and Design. According to a radio broadcast transcript Judson's own art college became USC's College of Fine Arts and Judson moved the college to the building near his home in the Arroyo area in 1901. Other sources claim the school was in the Highland Park location from 1897‚Äì1920. He became Dean of the USC College of Fine Arts in 1913, and remained so until his retirement in 1922.  Original building  The original three-story Islamic-style building on the Garvanza site was used as the campus for the USC College of Fine Arts starting in 1901. In December 1910, the building was destroyed by a fire that destroyed Judson's art works. Judson escaped from the burning building through a window and met his classes that day under the pepper trees on the property.  New facility built in 1911  After fire destroyed the original building, a \\"rambling, two-story building\\" designed by Robert Train and Robert Edmund Williams was built on the site in 1911. The new building was the home of the USC College of Fine Arts until 1920, when USC moved the arts school to the central campus. With USC vacating the space, Judson Studios moved into the building. In its early years, the building was also the headquarters for a group called the Arroyo Craftsmen who made furniture and art objects for fine homes built in the area until World War I, including work fabricated for noted Arts and Crafts architects, Greene and Greene. Frequent visitors to the building included Frank Lloyd Wright, Ernest A. Batchelder and Henry and Charles Greene.  Operations of the studios  When Walter H. Judson died in 1934, Horace T. Judson (grandson of William Lees) took over the day-to-day management of the business. Trained as a lawyer, Horace Judson retired from the active practice of law to continue the family's stained glass tradition. The studios were described in 1940 as \\"a medieval guild secluded from a hectic modern world by the vine-covered building.\\" At the time, Horace Judson told the Highland Park News-Herald: \\"Here there is no rush. We work slowly and for perfection as they did six centuries ago.\\" As Southern California's population grew rapidly after World War II, there was a tremendous demand for church construction. This in turn led to a boom in business for Judson Studios. At the peak in the 1950s, Judson employed 30 craftsmen. Walter W. Judson later recalled, \\"It got so it almost became counterproductive. It was difficult to keep track of what was going on.\\" As a result, Horace Judson established a rule that the studio would never again employ more than 15 craftsmen at once. Walter Judson, who took over the business from Horace (his father) in the 1970s, continued that rule, noting, \\"If you go over 15, you'll make more money. But you can lose your reputation too.\\" In 1973, Walter Judson noted that they preferred to train their own craftsmen and that it was difficult to find people fully interested in the craft: \\"They just want to play with it and then go off.\\" By 1981, Judson Studios was still using \\"the old methods that have yet to be improved.\\" Walter Judson noted, \\"We do use a lot more electricity and glass costs a lot more but that's about all that's changed.\\" At the time, Judson was using glass from all over the world in more than 600 colors. When the Los Angeles Times did a profile on the studios in 1986, there were nine artisans employed in the business, \\"employing techniques that have not changed much since the craft began to flourish in the 12th Century.\\" In 1991, Walter Judson offered his opinion that contemporary stained-glass craftsmanship surpassed even the heyday of the art in the 11th and 12th centuries. He later added, \\"It's a unique business, because you're producing something that is a joy and a beauty to other people and it will be for centuries.\\" Though principally known for stained glass, Judson Studios also creates works in marble carving, mosaic, carved and etched glass, furniture and other specialty items. As of 2017, Judson Studios remained a family-owned and operated business, with fifth generation David Judson, the great-great-grandson of William Lee Judson serving as the director of the business. In 2000, David Judson reported that 85% of the company's work was for religious institutions \\"of all different creeds, from Jewish to Christian to Islamic.\\"  Demolition threat and historic designation  Judson Studios was operated from 1920 to 1969 as a non-conforming use within a residential neighborhood. As a zoning variance neared its termination in 1969, the Judson family feared that the city would require demolition of the studios. In order to preserve the studios, the Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Board, with support from the Judson family, declared the building a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument (No. 62) in August 1969. The declaration of historic status stated: The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1999.  Examples of Judson stained glass  Over its first century of operation, Judson Studios produced more than 10,000 stained-glass works. Stained glass made at Judson Studios can be found in locations throughout Southern California and the United States. Examples can be seen at: * Hollyhock House at Barnsdall Art Park and Ennis House‚ÄîJudson Studios provided leaded and stained glass and tiles for Frank Lloyd Wright's work on the Hollyhock and Ennis Houses * The rotunda skylight at the Natural History Museum in Los Angeles * The \\"Congressional Prayer Room\\", also known as the \\"Chapel of All Creeds\\", at the U.S. Capitol * The United States Air Force Academy Cadet Chapel in Colorado Springs, Colorado * Chapel One at Edwards Air Force Base in California * The Alumni Memorial Window, done in heraldic style, at the Memorial Branch Library on Olympic Boulevard in Los Angeles, commemorating the alumni of Los Angeles High School who died in World War I * The massive interior dome ‚Äì ‚Äì at the Tropicana Resort & Casino in Las Vegas, built at a cost of $200,000 * The Jewel Court Dome at South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa, California * The Caesars Palace Palace Court dome in Las Vegas * Sun City Ginza in Tokyo * Mary, Queen of the Universe Shrine in Orlando, Florida, for which Judson produced 94 stained- glass windows * Highland Park Presbyterian Church in Los Angeles * St. James' Episcopal Church in South Pasadena * All Saints Church in Pasadena * First Congregational Church in Los Angeles Circa 1925 Judson Studios work at nearby Calvary Presbyterian Church, South Pasadena * Calvary Presbyterian Church in South Pasadena (See image to the right) Viewable outside at night * \\"The Life of Christ\\" window series at St. Barnabas Church in Eagle Rock * The Stanford Court Hotel in Nob Hill section of San Francisco * A heraldic design featuring white lions and tigers for Las Vegas illusionists Siegfried & Roy * Toluca Lake United Methodist Church in North Hollywood, where Judson began making stained glass windows in 1958 and was still installing windows in 1992 * The high Great Window at Glendale Presbyterian Church in Glendale, California (completed in 1974), with a Pentecost theme, dominated by a large figure of Christ, populated by people of different ethnic backgrounds rooted in the trunk of a tree of life * The tree of life window in the Lopaty Chapel at Valley Beth Shalom in Encino, California, made from 20,000 pieces of glass, with 613 leaves on the tree * The Arbor of Light Radiance Corridor at the Mountain View Mausoleum in Altadena, California * The Diamond Head Mortuary in Honolulu, Hawaii * The Goldman Estate in Honolulu * Honolulu International Country Club * All Saints Episcopal Church, San Diego, stained glass work completed between 1957 and 1967  Church of the Resurrection  Judson Studios monumental work at the United Methodist Church of the Resurrection, Leawood, Kansas: A Story of Three Gardens Detail of the head of Christ, Church of the Resurrection This new work is Judson Studio's most ambitious both in size and technical difficulty.

Windows on the first two floors are 12-over-12 sash, while the third-floor windows are eight-pane fixed sash. On the east (street-facing) side, there is a secondary entrance near the northern corner; that elevation is otherwise two bays wide. A single-story ell extends to the rear (north) of the main block. The interior retains high quality Federal period workmanship. The area that became Durham was owned in the 1760s by the Pejepscot Proprietors, among them Jonathan Bagley, who served in the American Revolutionary War. Nathaniel Osgood, who served in Bagley's regiment, is believed to have purchased the land where this house stands in 1779. Osgood built this house in 1785; it is one of Maine's best examples of the Federal period four-square hip-roofed central chimney plan.

Built in 1835 as a multi-denominational church, it is a distinctive local example of late Federal architecture with Greek and Gothic Revival features. From 1922 until 1986, it served as town hall, and now houses the local historical society. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001. Description and history The former Union Church building is located in the dispersed rural village of Durham, on the north side of Royalsborough Road (Maine State Route 136), about west of its junction with Maine State Route 9. It is a single-story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, clapboard siding, and a granite foundation. A gabled vestibule projects from the front, with a hip-roofed porch sheltering the main entrance, which is now at the center of that section. A two-stage tower rises, straddling the main roof and that of the vestibule, with an open belfry (housing a Revere bell) and an octagonal cupola above. The vestibule is three bays wide, with sash windows flanking the entrance, and the main block has former entrance locations (now boarded-over pointed-arch openings) on either side of the vestibule section. The interior, despite alterations, retains some of its original Greek Revival trim. The church was built in 1835 by a Baptist congregation, which allowed other groups to use it for religious services. This group declined in size during the 19th century, and its services ended in 1887. Other groups continued to use it into the early 20th century, but it was abandoned at the time it was deeded to the town in 1922. The town adapted it for use as its town hall, reconfiguring its entrances, and used it for that purpose until 1986. It continues to own the building, which is now occupied by the local historical society.

Thayer David stars as Nero Wolfe, gourmet, connoisseur and detective genius. Tom Mason costars as Archie Goodwin, Wolfe's assistant. Written and directed by Frank D. Gilroy, the made- for-TV movie was produced by Paramount Television as a pilot for an ABC television series, but the movie was shelved by the network for more than two years before finally being broadcast December 19, 1979. Production Disappointed with the Columbia Pictures films based on his first two Nero Wolfe novels, mystery writer Rex Stout was leery of further Hollywood adaptations in his lifetime. \\"I've had offers,\\" Stout told author Dick Lochte in 1967, \\"but I haven't been to a movie in 30 years and I despise television. ... Anyway, the money, in addition to what the books are bringing in, would put me in a tax bracket where I wouldn't see much of it.

But the film had still not aired when Thayer David died in July 1978. In a November 1979 interview, Gilroy mildly complained to the Associated Press that Nero Wolfe had still not been broadcast by ABC, and praised the performance of David. \\"It doesn't affect my career one way or the other that they haven't shown it, but that was the most important thing he ever did on film, and I'm determined to get it aired,\\" Gilroy said.Sharbutt, Jay, The Associated Press, November 11, 1979 Nero Wolfe was finally broadcast by ABC-TV at midnight December 18, 1979.Terrace, Vincent, Television 1970‚Äì1980.

It is locally distinctive for the farmhouse, built about 1830 out of rough-split granite after a fire destroyed the Nelson's first homestead. The farm listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. Description and history The Nelson Farm is located in the far western part of the mostly rural community of Livermore, on the west side of Shackley Hill Road, north of its junction with Maine State Route 108. The property now consists of , significantly reduced from more than at its height, with stone walls lining some of its borders and field divisions. The property consists of rolling terrain, now mostly wooded, with a portion planted as an apple orchard. The farm complex includes the main house and a detached barn, both 19th-century structures. The house's main block is 1-1/2 stories in height, and is built out of locally sourced granite that has been roughly split, quarry-faced, and laid in irregular courses. Several rough stringcourses project from the wall, and the front facade has a projecting vestibule of stone, the doorway set in an arched opening. The south-facing roof has a wood-frame shed-roof dormer, and a wood-frame ell extends to the rear (west) of the main block. A wood frame barn, built about 1877, stands south of the house. The Nelson Farm was established in 1816 by Deacon Alexander Nelson on land that his father had purchased the previous year. According to family tradition, Nelson's wife and infant daughter died in a house fire in 1819. He supposedly began construction of the stone house soon afterward, but its Greek Revival styling suggests he may not have begun it until after his marriage to his third wife in 1830. The property remained in the hands of Nelson's descendants until the early 20th century.

Two of these agents, Hammerfist and Metalisis, have malfunctioned and turned against Centro- Holographix, seeking to destroy it and liberate their original human forms. As part of the malfunction, the two holograms have been merged into a single being who can transform back and forth between their two forms at will. They initially escape from their storage pods in a laboratory at the bottom of the ocean and must fight their way out, after which they must cross the ocean, battling a variety of undersea creatures as they go. Finally, Hammerfist and Metalisis reach a destroyed city and penetrate the Centro-Holographix facility, confronting and eventually destroying the corporation's ruler, a being known only as The Master. Hammerfist and Metalisis, separated into their original bodies, escape Centro-Holographix for good. Gameplay Hammerfist battles an enemy robot in the first room of the game The player controls either the male Hammerfist or the female Metalisis; as they occupy the same body, the player can transform from one to the other at any time in order to utilize their distinct skills. Hammerfist is a more powerful combatant, able to sustain more damage and fire energy bolts from his fists, while Metalisis is able to cartwheel (or 'flick-flack') over obstacles and gaps between platforms. Each room consists of a series of challenges, primarily computer screens which must be smashed and enemies which must be destroyed, before they are able to progress to the next room. Virtually all rooms require both characters to be used in order to complete them. The game features separate health bars for Hammerfist and Metalisis, with the player being restricted to one character after the other is killed, as well as one for The Master. As the player defeats enemies and destroys computers, a variety of power-ups drop for them. If the player leaves a room without collecting all the available power- ups, their value is added to The Master's strength; when this is full, all power-ups become negative, and will harm the player character, until a sufficient number of them have been avoided. Some rooms also feature booths within which both characters can recharge their health. Upon the death of both characters, the player is returned to the beginning of the game.

Etymology The name Jonai is derived from the name of a Chutia princess named Jona who was married off to a Kachari prince named Kansan. As per folklore, the Kachari prince had entered the Chutia kingdom along with 900 men as he had left his kingdom due to some personal issues. The Chutia princess having heard about this encroachment ordered her soldiers to make the prince and his followers captive and to bring them to the royal court in Sadiya. Later, as events turned out, the princess fell in love with the prince and she was married off to him and they settled in Jonai. The other followers too married local women. The Sonowal Kacharis are thought to be descendants of this group of people and recall the queen as Jonadoi Ai.Khanikar, Surjyakanta. Chutia Jaatir Itihax aru Luko-Sanskriti.1991,p.367.

It was owned by Israel Washburn and his descendants. The Gothic Revival-style house was built in 1821 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1969. The house is now operated as part of the Washburn-Norlands Living History Center, a 19th-century period farm with living-history demonstrations. The buildings include the Norlands mansion, a mid-19th-century period schoolhouse, a library with displays about the Washburn family, a meeting house, a farmer's cottage, and a barn with farm animals. The barn and farmer's cottage burned down in April 2008 but the Farmer's Cottage was rebuilt and reopened in early 2011. As of July 29, 2012, the barn has yet to be rebuilt.\\"Norlands Fire Spares Center's Crown\\" - Portland Press Herald, March 17, 2010 The Washburn-Norlands Living History Center is a non-profit organization, dedicated to the preservation of 18th- and 19th-century rural Maine heritage. The Washburn- Norlands Foundation was formed in 1973, at the bequest of Washburn family descendants. The Foundation converted the property into a living history museum with the intent of preserving the estate and the remarkable stories of its past. Today the organization is run by a Board of Trustees, which together ensures the protection of the estate, its collections and their future. The Washburn-Norlands estate is occupied by four historic buildings, the 1867 Mansion, 1883 Library, 1828 Meeting House and 1853 School House. Each building has been restored and operates as a museum. The Norlands is home to a number of collections; including Washburn family papers, photographs, artwork, historic clothing, books, furniture, and more. The Washburn family is one of Maine's, and the nation's, most political and industrious families. The history of the Washburns at Norlands can be traced back more than 200 years to when Israel Washburn, Sr. purchased the original homestead built by Cyrus Hamlin (father of Hannibal Hamlin) in 1809 and raised ten children with his wife, Martha Benjamin. They lived a life of poverty as they worked the farm. The four oldest sons worked for neighboring farms to help pay their father's debts. With humble beginnings, the seven Washburn sons rose to gain prominence with state, national and international politics, business and industry, diplomacy, and military affairs. Three of the brothers served in U.S. Congress at the same time representing three different states, two became Foreign Ministers, one served as Civil War Governor of Maine, one was a U.S. Senator, one was a Civil War General, one owned a bank, one ran a newspaper, one founded the Soo Railroad, and one served as a captain in the Navy during the Civil War. Two of the brothers formed flour mills: one became Gold Medal Flour and the other merged with Pillsbury Flour. No other American family has produced in a single generation a level of political and business leadership equivalent to that of the Washburns from Livermore, Maine. See also *Ethel Wilson Gammon, founder and first executive director of the Washburn-Norlands Living History Center Fire On the night of April 28, 2008, an inferno rose into the air from the Washburn-Norlands Living History Center. The fire was started by a heat lamp that was being used to keep a litter of piglets warm through the cold Maine nighttime. Presumably, the lamp tipped over and fell into the hay bedding, which sent the 100-foot-long, three-story barn up in flames that were high enough to be seen over the surrounding trees. Suddenly, the famous mansion right next door, which had for so many decades been a local treasure, was in danger of extinction. Thankfully, in a battle against the blaze that lasted until the next morning, the mansion and most of the rest of the center (the library, meeting house, and schoolhouse), with the exception of the barn and farmer's cottage, was saved. This miracle could not have happened had it not been for intelligent preparation and management foresight. The local Livermore Fire Department, which is composed entirely of volunteers, had gone through numerous drills in case the exact event were to occur. It is usual practice for all fire departments to identify buildings and areas that could be considered ‚Äútarget hazards‚Äù within their communities, such as the Norlands had been considered. The preconceived strategies and knowledge of the closest water body, along with the help from 10 other departments surrounding the area, paid off. The Livermore Fire Chief, Donald Castonguay, directed his team and community members who had come to observe to get all of the treasures out of the mansion just in case. Thankfully, this precaution was not needed, as the Assistant Chief, Andrew Berry, led the men on the outside to make ‚Äútrench cuts‚Äù in the roof of the barn before it joined with the mansion so that the flames would exit through the roof instead of continuing along the hall floor into the upper levels of the mansion. In addition, he placed a positive pressure fan at the doors of the mansion in order to direct the flames away from the main building. Berry was quoted as saying ‚ÄúThe flames stopped where we wanted them to.‚Äù The ability to make quick decisions due to preparedness is what spared the rest of the Center; a vital piece of the town's identity and culture. The rescue of the Norlands garnered much praise. Langhorne Washburn of Virginia is the only living descendant who was born at the Norlands and was quoted by the Sun Journal as saying ‚Äú...Thank God Norlands didn‚Äôt burn. I would like to commend (the firefighters) on their efficiency.‚Äù \\"Norlands to 'Rebuild.'\\" Sun Journal. April 30, 2008. www.sunjournal.com The men and women on the department were commended once more at a Chamber of Commerce meeting where the Maine State Fire Marshall declared ‚ÄúNo other Fire Department could have done better.‚Äù The Norlands Living History Center is a fun and interesting place where both children and adults can learn about what life was like in the days of the Washburn family, which is why when upon seeing the 17-room mansion still standing after the fire was extinguished, Norma Boothby, a volunteer at the Center for over 25 years, burst into tears. Over the years, thousands of schoolchildren and college students have gone through the Norlands in order to get the experience of its original inhabitants, who are portrayed by volunteers like Boothby. Some of these students even came back to help out with clean up, sorting through debris and reflecting on the laughs and lessons they had experienced there. Norlands trustee President Kathleen Beauregard said on Wednesday, April 30, 2008, ‚ÄúWe are going to rebuild the buildings that were lost.‚Äù As of June 13, 2016, rebuilding efforts have begun for the barn, with the framework established. Though there is still plenty of work to do, the town of Livermore is inspired to rebuild, remembering that fateful night where they were at risk of losing such a precious historical landmark.\\"Norlands to 'Rebuild.'\\" Sun Journal.

The Lucian Blaga Central University Library of Cluj-Napoca () serves Babe≈ü-Bolyai University in Romania. History The library was founded in 1872, at the same time as Franz Joseph University (eventually supplanted by Babe≈ü-Bolyai University). Its initial stock, about 18,000 volumes, was made up by gathering the collections received from the Law Academy of Sibiu, the Medical School and Government Archives of Cluj, and those of Iosif Benigni's rich private collections. In 1873/74 the Transylvanian Museum was transferred to the Central University Library. Its library had been founded in 1859, as the Library of the Society of the Transylvanian Museum, on the basis of donations and grants from Metropolitan Bishops Andrei ≈ûaguna and Alexandru Sterca-»òulu»õiu and Count Imre Mik√≥. In 1860 the Library of the Transylvanian Museum had been declared \\"public\\" and open for the use of citizens, but in 1873/74 it was transferred to the university, being moved to a location near the Central University Library. Although housed in the same building, these two large libraries grew independently of each other for about half a century.Kent After World War I, when Austria-Hungary broke up and Transylvania (including Cluj) joined Romania, a Romanian university was founded in 1920; it used the existing Central University Library (dedicated in the presence of the royal family and renamed the Library of King Ferdinand I University) and the Library of the Transylvanian Museum, still separate institutions. (They merged in 1948, following World War II.) The new university was endowed with legal deposit copies and was supported by permanent state grants. Many Romanian institutions (the Romanian Academy, the Education Department, the University of Bucharest) contributed to the rapid development of the Central University Library of Cluj; the Romanian Academy Library endowed it with Romanian publications. The first University Report, issued 10 October 1920, mentioned only the \\"solemn promises\\" of the Romanian Academy, but the Report of the 1921/22 school year reported a donation of about 30,000 volumes, most of them offered as gifts by the Romanian Academy Library. On 26 September 1923, another collection of some 4,000 volumes was transferred from the Romanian Academy. The same specialisation process of both faculty sections and library branches took place within Cluj University (which finally became Babe≈ü-Bolyai University in 1959 after a series of institutional changes) as had evolved in the Bucharest and Ia≈üi Universities. The collections of the library and its specialised network reached 580,000 volumes in 1938; after World War II it was second only to the two National Libraries, with over 2,000,000 volumes of books and periodicals, reaching 3,600,000 by 2002.Official site Among the library's special collections (set up as a distinct department in 1923, after a collection from the Moldavian boyar Gheorghe Sion was received) are items handed down from the Transylvanian Museum collection, maps, engravings, postcards and rare books, including the incunabulum Codex Iustinianus, printed at Nuremberg in 1475, and the set of Gospels printed by Deacon Coresi at Bra≈üov in 1561. From its founding until 1909, the library functioned in the main university building. From 1906 to 1908, the current library building was erected following plans by architects K√°lm√°n Giergl and Fl√≥ris Korb; books were then moved there in 1908-09.Alicu, Dorin, et al. Cluj-Napoca, de la √Ænceputuri p√¢nƒÉ azi, p.29. 1995: Clusium, . Extensions to the building were added until 1934, and an annex with a capacity of over 2,000,000 volumes was added in 1961.

Built , this Federal period house is most significant for the folk artwork drawn on the walls of its halls and stairwell by Orison Wood, an itinerant muralist and prot√©g√© of Rufus Porter, a well-known exponent of the form. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. Description Cushman Tavern is a large 2¬Ω story wood frame house standing at the southwest corner of Webster Corner Road and Middle Road (Maine State Route 9) on a parcel that straddles the town lines of Lisbon and Sabattus. The main block of the house has a side-gable roof and twin interior chimneys. It is attached by a series of ells (one two stories, the next one) to a barn. The main facade faces west, and has a center entrance flanked by sidelight windows and topped by an entablature that is interrupted by a half-round transom. and The house was built about 1825 by a Mr. Dwindal, and was purchased two years later by Samuel Cushman. Cushman and his descendants operated a tavern on the premises for many years; it has long since been converted into a single-family residence. The house's principal feature of significance lies in a series of murals that adorn the hallways of the first and second floor of the main block, and the stairwell that connects them. They were executed by Orison Wood, an itinerant fresco artist known to be active in the area in the second half of the 1820s. Cushman family lore recounts that the painter arrived in 1826, offering his services. Wood was trained by his father in the art of fresco, but took is ideas about content and form from the writings of Rufus Porter, whose artwork still graces walls across northern New England. These works may have been executed under Porter's supervision.

He studied medicine at the University of Graz, and afterwards was an assistant to Anton Weichselbaum (1845‚Äì1920) at the clinic of pathological anatomy at the University of Vienna. In 1907 he was an assistant to Ernst Finger (1856‚Äì1939) at the dermatology clinic in Vienna, and in 1918 he became an associate professor. Kyrle specialized in microscopic and histological research of skin disorders. His name is associated with Kyrle disease, being also known as \\"hyperkeratosis penetrans\\". In 1916 Kyrle referred to this condition as hyperkeratosis follicularis et parafollicularis in cutem penetrans. It is characterized by keratotic plugs that develop in hair follicles and eccrine ducts, penetrating the epidermis and extending into the dermis. This disorder is often associated with diabetes mellitus and kidney failure. He performed investigations on the use of Jauregg's malaria therapy for treatment of syphilis in its early stages, and with Dr. Weichselbaum, he performed important studies involving the origin and development of the islets of Langerhans in the fetus.

Built in 1872, it is a fine example of a cotton mill built at the height of the Industrial Revolution. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. It is now residential housing. Description and history The Farwell Mill is located in central Lisbon, at the junction of Village and Lisbon Streets and on the western bank of the Sabattus River. It is a large and sprawling L-shaped brick three-story structure. The building is minimally decorated, with corbelling at the cornice below the gable roof, and a four-story tower at the southwestern end whose top level has paired round-arch Italianate windows and a shallow- pitch hip roof with a broad eave. The complex was originally larger, with four-story additions to the south and west, but these have been demolished. Just north of the main building is a small single-story gas works building, one of the few of its type surviving in the state. The mill was built in 1872 by Nathaniel Farwell, a businessman with textile-related interests all over New England. This was the only full-scale textile operation he owned. It was built using the water privilege of one of Maine's earliest woolen mills, established in 1808, and expanded using a second water privilege just downstream that originally had a grist mill. Farwell's mill was reported to have a capacity of 12,000 spindles, and was an economic mainstay of the otherwise rural region for many years.

Built in 1897, the surviving building is a small portion of a once-extensive religious enclave established by the evangelical Christian leader Frank Sandford, exhibiting a unique expression of religious and summer retreat architecture. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. Description and history The Shiloh Temple stands on a property overlooking the southern bank of the Androscoggin River, a few miles south of Lisbon Falls, off the north side of Shiloh Road. The surviving portion of the temple is a four-story structure, its ground floor a raised basement of brick, and the rest a frame structure with a mansarded roof. A seven-stage tower projects from the street-facing front, square in shape except for the crowning open circular belfry and cupola. The chapel in 2019 Frank Sandford was an ordained Baptist minister, who in 1893 left his ministry in Topsham, Maine on a quest to evangelize the world. He attracted a large number of followers, and construction of the Temple began in 1897. The temple's once-extensive property grew to include a large quadrangular complex, of which the present building is the only surviving element. At its height, the complex had 500 rooms and space for more than 1,000 residents. Life at the complex was strictly regulated by Sandford, who claimed to be a new Elijah, and many of his followers sold off their possessions to join his \\"Holy Ghost and Us\\" society. In the early 1900s Sandford took a number of his followers on a round-the-world proselytizing mission aboard the yacht Coronet, and was arrested on manslaughter charges in 1911 following a misguided and undersupplied voyage to Greenland, in which six crew died of scurvy and related illnesses. Sandford's kingdom was ended by legal action in 1920 following the death of a Shiloh resident, and most of its buildings were demolished in the 1950s. Low level occupation continued, and the present Shiloh Chapel is a successor to Sandford's legacy. A minister of the Holy Ghost and Us Society, George W. Higgins, was a victim of New England's last tarring and feathering incident in 1899.

The house was completed in 1902 to design by William R. Miller and is considered the finest example of his residential work. It was originally one of three identical houses that stood side-by-side until the early 1920s. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. Description and history The Penney House is located on the west side of the Mechanic Falls village, at the southern corner of Maple and Summer Streets. It is a high-style 2-1/2 story Georgian Revival structure, with a dormered hip roof, clapboard siding, and a foundation of brick and granite. Its principal feature is a full-height elaborate portico projecting from the front, with two-story Corinthian columns and pilasters supporting a fully pedimented and modillioned gable with a floral design at its center. This portico shelters a Palladian window at the second level, and partially covers a single-story porch that extends over the main entrance, with clustered Corinthian columns for support. Ground floor windows are topped by entablatures decorated with swags, and topped by projecting cornices. The interior continues the high quality workmanship, with decorative plasterwork and woodwork, and a stained glass window at the landing of the main staircase. The house was designed by Lewiston architect William R. Miller, and was is first residential commission. It is an extraordinarily rich Colonial Revival building for a relatively modest formerly industrial village setting in the state, but also typical of Miller's flamboyant style. It is one of three nearly identical houses designed by Miller for the Penney brothers, owners of a local factory that built steam engines and boilers. The house of Almont Penney was destroyed by fire, and that of Charles Penney was moved and partly dismembered in the 1940s. The present house, when it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002, still used original knob-and- tube wiring installed when the house was built, and portions of its original steam heating plant (presumably manufactured by the Penney's plant) were also still in use.

This structure is a model of the Eiffel Tower in Paris, France.  Background   Origin at Christian Brothers University  Engineering students at Christian Brothers University originally constructed the tower to commemorate the 1990 Memphis in May festival. Each year, the festival honors a country, and 1990 focused on France. According to Brother Patrick O'Brien, a public relations official for the university at the time: \\"[the tower] was the centerpiece of one of our most popular quads.\\" Regardless, the wooden tower was a temporary structure. Moreover, it could not remain at the university because students began to climb it even though it could not support their weight.  Finding a new home in Paris  In April 1991, the Paris-Henry County Chamber of Commerce sponsored \\"Paris U.S.A.,\\" an event created to celebrate the shared charm of the fifteen U.S. cities named for the French capital. Representatives from five Parises accepted their invitations to enjoy Paris U.S.A. in Paris, Tennessee. During the fall of that year, Brother Patrick O'Brien remembered the celebration and asked Paris if it would be interested in accepting a scale replica of the Eiffel Tower. The city accepted, and the job began.  Construction and reconstruction   Initial construction  The tower was designed to scale by Tom Morrison, professor emeritus of civil engineering; Jim Jacobs, assistant professor of mechanical engineering; and Roland Raffanti, engineering lab technician, from Christian Brothers University. According to Brother Patrick O'Brien, Morrison designed the model based on the original drawings of Gustave Eiffel. At tall, the tower is a nearly perfect 1:20 scale replica of the original. Built through the labor of more than 10,000 hours donated by CBU students, faculty, alumni, and friends, the tower contains 500 pieces of Douglas fir and 6,000 steel rods. The monument was assembled in CBU's Buckman Quadrangle. After CBU dismantled the tower, the parts were delivered to Paris in February 1992 and given two coats of paint. The Paris Public Works Department reassembled the tower in Memorial Park.  Dedication  The landmark was dedicated January 29, 1993. Paris acknowledged CBU's generous gesture with a joyful dedication ceremony and a plaque at the base of the tower.  Strengthening the structure  After deterioration to the wood structure, Keith Jackson, owner of Precision Grinding and Metals of Paris, recreated the original wood replica into a steel structure that still stands today. To accomplish the feat, PGM constructed the tower in three sections and trailered each section to Memorial Park where it was finally erected.

The overall water level in the lagoons is controlled by the main control dam at Willow Road. Three low dams keep the water levels below the inner islands. Recreational opportunities at Skokie Lagoons include biking, fishing, boating, birding, and paddleboarding. History The site of Skokie Lagoons was previously a marsh, known by the Potawatomi name Chewbab Skokie (\\"Big Wet Prairie\\") or Skokie Marsh. The marsh was partially drained by local farmers, leaving a peat bog. During spring floods it became a lake that inundated adjacent property and roads. Between 1933 and 1940, the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) executed a plan to bring the waters under control. Several thousand workers moved four million yards of earth to recontour the land, creating the artificial lagoons of today.

The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. Description and history The George Seaverns House is located in the village of Mechanic Falls, on a rise on the west side of High Street, a residential side street overlooking the village center. It is a 1-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, clapboard siding, and a brick foundation. The house occupies a sloping site which would have overlooked Elm Street, a major thoroughfare, when it was built. The house is stylistically Gothic Revival in character, with decorative vergeboard, window hoods, and ogee brackets. The house's interior has an unusual asymmetrical plan, diverging from the conventional central hall plans that typified area houses of the period. Its main (western) elevation features a series of porches supported by chamfered posts with decorative brackets. The house was built in 1853 by George W. Seaverns, whose only known description is as a \\"paper worker\\" in the locally prominent paper industry. A second owner, later in the 19th century, was Charles E.

In 1977, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places.It was listed in the National Register as \\"All Soul's Chapel\\" with an apostrophe placed between the \\"l\\" and \\"s\\" in Souls. The chapel was built in 1912 for use by the staff and guests of the Poland Spring Resort. It is now owned by the Poland Spring Preservation Society which also owns the Maine State Building (from the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893 in Chicago).Poland Spring Preservation Society The chapel houses a series of hand-painted windows and an Ernest M. Skinner Opus 564 pipe organ. The chapel is currently used as a venue for weddings, baptisms and other services as well as plays and concerts. Chapel history In 1885, Julius Gassauer first started religious services for the employees of the dining room of the Poland Spring House. They were first held out of doors in the open air, but as it became necessary to find some shelter for these meetings in case of rain, the idea of a chapel was proposed. A fund was started by the contributions of the employees. When meetings were transferred to the dining hall, some of the guests of the Houses began to attend. They were glad to add to the Chapel Fund, which grew to about twenty-five hundred dollars, before the effort was stopped for a season. About this time some of the ladies of Poland Spring organized the first ‚ÄúChildren‚Äôs Fair,‚Äù for the purpose of encouraging the children of the guests help make this possible. The proceeds were at first given to a ‚ÄúFresh Air Fund‚Äù for the benefit of the poor children of the cities. Later $5,000 was donated for what was known as the ‚ÄúPoland Spring Free Bed‚Äù at the Central Maine General Hospital in Lewiston. Meanwhile, Miss Sadie Ricker had organized a Sunday School for the children of the surrounding country, and it was thought; ‚ÄúWhy not aid this Sunday School?‚Äù Accordingly, this was done from the proceeds of the Children's Fairs, and after the school had been well established and well equipped, a small fund remained, the interest from which, with outside contributions, was used for several years for Christmas parties and summer outings. Having worked on this worthy project in a substantial way, the ladies next agreed to work for a fund large enough to secure a chapel. They said; ‚ÄúLet us realize the dream of the earnest man who began the movement for a chapel here at Poland Spring, and the desire of the owners of this estate, who have expressed their readiness to contribute one-half the final cost of the edifice.‚Äù Inspired by this purpose, the ladies and families and guests at Poland Spring succeeded in raising approximately $15,000. In September 1909, little Garrett A. Hobart III (the grandson of the first vice-president under McKinley), then only two years old, performed the important ceremony of breaking ground for the new chapel. For the next three years a large number of interested friends never ceased their efforts in behalf of the little church building. This chapel was erected on the very top of the hill at the Poland Spring estate, overlooking the panorama of magnificent natural scenery. No expense was spared to make it of a quality commensurate with its environments and function. All Souls Chapel circa 1920 Maine granite from the best quarries was procured for the walls and arches; quarter-sawn oak of the finest quality was used for the ceilings, doors, and other interior woodwork; brass for sills, reading desk, railings; and a floor of inlaid mosaic of beautiful and expensive design was made. The work of construction was performed by Italians brought here from Boston, and was done slowly and with great care, that no detail should lack in permanence or artistic value. The large memorial window in the alcove at the front of the church is of stained glass illustrating the inscription which runs through it, ‚ÄúI am the Resurrection and the Life.‚Äù Through the bottom of the window are the words, ‚ÄúGlory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost.‚Äù The center section of the window contains the figure of Jesus and is resplendently beautiful in its coloring. This window was the gift of two lady visitors at Poland Spring, and was a very expensive contribution to the edifice. The church was dedicated on September 1, 1912. The following year the bells were installed in the tower. Known as the ‚ÄúWestminster Peals‚Äù or ‚ÄúCambridge Quarters‚Äù they were a unit of four, keyed in G, C, D, and E, according to their weight of 1,500, 500, 400, and 300 pounds. They were composed of Lake Superior copper and imported tin, in the correct proportion to form the best ringing alloy. On the largest of the bells is the following inscription: ‚ÄúPresented to All Souls Chapel, Poland Spring, Maine, by Mrs. Calvin Allen Richards and Miss Annie Louise Richards of Boston, Mass. June 1, 1913.‚Äù Church services were held during the summer months (May through October) until 40 years ago. There were two Catholic services and one Protestant service each Sunday. The Catholic service was a mission of the Catholic Church at Yarmouth. The ministers serving here came from various towns, or may have been guests or visiting travelers. Services have been held in the winter months upon special occasion, as the building was kept heated all year, for protection to the interior furnishings and equipment. This chapel has been the scene of countless weddings, as there is a great sentimental attachment here for thousands of persons who may have worked or vacationed at this resort. The prayer at the official opening ceremony of this chapel in 1912 ended as follows: ‚ÄúWe pray that this beautiful chapel may be a perpetual reminder of the reality of the spiritual life to many who are struggling upward toward the height where Thou dost dwell.‚ÄùBennett, Mary E., editor.

Built in the early 19th century and significantly restyled in 1867, it is a fine example of Greek Revival architecture with added Italianate features. The congregation for which it was built grew out of a Methodist revival meeting held at the site in 1804, and was one of the first Methodist congregations in the state. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003. It is presently unused. Description and history The West Durham Methodist Church is located in a rural area of central-western Durham, on the north side of Runaround Pond Road, a short way west of its junction with Hallowell Road (Maine State Route 9). It is a single-story wood frame structure, with a front gable roof, clapboard siding, and a stone foundation. A small square section projects from the north (rear) of the building, providing a small apse in the interior. The south-facing front facade is symmetrically arrange, exhibiting predominantly Greek Revival features. It has corner pilasters rising to a broad entablature, with a fully pedimented gable that has a triangular bracketed panel at its center. A pair of entrances flank a three-part window, where each section has a rounded top. The entrances are each flanked by pilasters and topped by an entablature and cornice. The entrances each lead to small separate vestibules, which are separate from each other by a recess in the main chamber that houses the choir. The main chamber is simply arranged, with bench pews on either side of a central aisle, and the pulpit set in the apsoidal recess. The building's construction date is somewhat murky. The building site was the location of an early Methodist revival meeting, held in 1802, and was by local tradition built in 1804, the date appearing in a panel on the front of the building. However, the congregation was not formally organized until 1810, and the property was not transferred to church trustees until 1818 (although it may have been in use by the church since before then). The building has architectural evidence that its interior at one time had a three-sided gallery and a different orientation of its pews, suggesting an early 19th-century construction date. The exterior's Greek Revival and Italianate features in all likelihood date from a major 1867 renovation (even though the Greek Revival was generally out of fashion by then), at which time interior alterations may also have been made. The church's parish originally stretched from Litchfield to Freeport.

Description and history The Turner Town House is located in the village of Turner Center, on the north side of SR 117 just west of the First Universalist Church. It is set back from the road, on the south bank of the Nezinscot River. It is a small single-story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, clapboard siding, and fieldstone foundation. The main facade faces south, and is five bays wide. The bays are arranged symmetrical but with irregular spacing, with three sash windows flanking two virtually identical entrances. Each window has a single large shutter mounted to its left. The exterior is otherwise devoid of significant stylisting elements. The interior consists of a single large chamber, whose floor is sloped in a V shape from the front and back toward the center, where the town officials sat during town meetings. This feature is believed to be unique among Maine's town houses. The town of Turner was incorporated in 1787, and its earliest town meetings were held in a local church. From 1822 to 1830 meetings were held in a local school, at which time the town engaged in a series of acrimonious meetings concerning the location of a dedicated town house. The disputed was centered over issues of the town's growth, which had begun in the eastern part of the town, but had in recent years developed more rapidly to the west. The town house was built in 1830 at a site nearer the geographic center, but was surreptitiously disassembled and relocated three times by competing groups within the town, before being fixed in place at this location.

The church was designed in 1923 by Lewiston architects Gibbs & Pulsifer, and is an imposing example of neo-Gothic architecture for a relatively small community. It is also the only known church in Maine with association to the Slovak immigrant community. It was dedicated in 1926 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. It is presently home to the Maine Art Glass Studio. Description and history The former St. Cyril and St. Methodius Church is located in the village of Lisbon Falls, at the southeast corner of Main Street (Maine State Route 125) and High Street. It is a large rectangular brick building. with a gabled roof. The front facade is flanked by squat square towers with buttress- style projecting pilasters at the corners. The center of the facade has a large Gothic arch, in which there are two entrances, each also set in arches, with a circle-in-cross design above. Atop the large arch is a wagon-wheel rose window, and the gable above is crested by a cross. The Slovak community in Lisbon Falls was former in the 1890s, when a group migrated there from New Jersey in search of work at the Worumbo Mill, and formed a tightly knit social group. Alienated from other well-established cultural groups, they formed their own Catholic organization, and raised funds to build this church, which was completed in 1923. It was formally accepted into the Roman Catholic Diocese of Portland in 1936. The building now houses a studio of glass artists.

Founded in 1864, it was at one point the community's largest employer. Its main building, dating to its founding, was destroyed by fire in 1987. The complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973, and was delisted in 2017. Description The surviving elements of the Worumbo Mill stand on the northern bank of the Androscoggin River, just south of the center of the village of Lisbon Falls. Originally a sprawling utilitarian 19th century building adorned with additions and decorative towers, only two 1920 concrete buildings, one of one story and the other of three, stand today. Both are set close to Canal Street, adjacent to the dam (now used for hydroelectric generation) that provided power to the mill. History The Worumbo Mill began as the brainchild of two residents of Lisbon Falls, Edward Plummer and H.A. Tibbetts. Later, Oliver Moses, a businessman from Bath was brought in as they sought to build a factory producing fine woolens. Ground was broken in 1864 and production began in 1865, with Mr. Moses as president of the company. Operating losses were substantial that first year at $100,000. This amount is roughly equivalent to $2 million today. During the 1920s an expansion was added to the mill and is the white building that stands today. The 1940s saw equipment upgrades. Due to pressure from overseas clothing manufacturers, the mill announced that it would be closing in 1964 and all 600 employees would lose their jobs. An attempt to restart production later failed. Worumbo Mill, 2016 A fire started in the original portion of the mill on July 23, 1987, completely destroying the old portion of the complex, but the 1920s expansion was spared from the flames. All told, 283 firefighters responded to the blaze. Although the fire was controlled in five hours, using 15,000 gallons of water per minute to do so (a total of 17.8 million gallons was used the first day) crews stayed for another 13 to extinguish the flames, and returned each day for over a week to be sure no flare-ups occurred. The Maine Forest Service responded with a helicopter to drop water, and crews from many surrounding towns assisted in the battle. It was one of Maine's largest industrial fires. The mill was also featured in the Stephen King novel 11/22/63. The mill was demolished in 2016.

It is a Grade II* listed building. History The Great Hall The current complex replaced an earlier timber guildhall on the site which was built in 1356 and replaced by a stone structure commissioned by Bishop Cuthbert Tunstall in 1535. The earliest part of the current facility is the guildhall which was commissioned by Bishop John Cosin and dates back to 1665. The town hall was extended in 1752, when George Bowes, the mayor, commissioned extensive alterations to the mayor's parlor. The facade of the town hall was completely refaced in 1754. John Fenwick, a leading abolitionist, spoke at an emancipation meeting held in the hall in 1826. The complex was extended to the west, i.e. the rear of the guildhall, to create a town hall, which was designed by Philip Charles Hardwick in the Perpendicular style, in 1851. The Great Hall inside the complex is long, is richly panelled and has a hammerbeam roof which is high. The walls of the Great Hall are lined with wooden plaques commemorating some of freemen of the City of Durham including the footballer Sir Bobby Robson, the writer Bill Bryson and the cleric Archbishop Desmond Tutu. The complex also includes the council chamber which was the meeting place of the municipal borough of Durham and Framwelgate until 1974 and then of Durham District until it was dissolved in 2009; it remains the meeting place of the mayor and aldermen of Durham, who are now appointed by charter trustees. The adjoining indoor markets, which were built around and underneath the town hall complex, opened on 18 December 1852. Further alterations were made in 2008 including a new public entrance, disabled access and fire protection throughout the complex installed at a cost of ¬£0.8 million. The facility, which was opened to public viewing in November 2018, includes a case displaying some of the belongings of J√≥zef Boruw≈Çaski, a court dwarf known as \\"the Little Count\\" who wrote the \\"Memoirs of Count Boruwlask\\", an autobiography of his life. It also contains the original city charter, the city's civic sword and the pikes of the mayor's personal bodyguard.

Located along the former right-of-way of Keystone Spring Road in eastern Poland, the facility consists of two structures, a spring house built c. 1885 and a bottling house built in 1929. The facilities are, along with the more well-known Poland Spring Bottling Plant and Spring House, the only known surviving elements of the early period of mineral water bottling in Maine.National Register nomination for Keystone Mineral Springs; available by request from the National Park Service The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005. Description The Keystone spring house and bottling house are accessed via Keystone Spring Road, a grass and dirt track that parallels Empire Road, running north-south for most of its length, with a short paved section at the southern end where the road joins Empire Road. The spring house is located a short way north of the southern bend, and the bottling house is about further north. The spring house is a single story clapboarded structure with a gable roof, measuring by . It is located on the west side of the roadway, oriented east-to-west, although its main facade faces north, along a track leading to the farmstead of the Pratt family who first developed the spring. The main facade has three bays, the central one containing a large sliding door, while the bay to the east has a window and that to the west has a smaller doorway that is now blocked up. The eastern facade also has a large sliding door. The interior has been neglected to the point where elements are collapsing. The spring rises in a granite basin set in a concrete floor, and is captured in a pipe which extends to the bottling house. The bottling house is also a single story wood frame structure, built in 1929 after the previous building on the site was destroyed by fire. It is architecturally unremarkable, with similar proportions to the spring house. Its interior is largely unfinished, with exposed ceiling rafters and wall joists. The southern part of the building is taken up by a tank, lined in granite, with an overflow catchbasin and troughs at which the filling operation took place. At the north end of the building is a room in which the filled bottles were capped, labelled and packaged for shipping. Much of the original early 20th-century equipment used in these processes remains. History The Keystone Mineral Spring was operated as a business from 1885 until the mid-1990s, primarily serving central Maine. Seriah M. Pratt, the farmer who owned the land, realized that the quality of the water from his spring was comparable to that of Poland Spring, and began bottling and selling it in 1884. In 1885 he brought in his nephew, Edward Pratt, who acquired full control of the business in 1896. The business was a success, delivering bottled water in Maine as far away as Portland; some was also shipped as far as New Jersey, where the younger Pratt's business partner moved. It was operated in the 20th century by a succession of lessees until about 1995, although processing was at times sporadic because the spring ran dry. Plans were laid by new owners in 2004 to rehabilitate the facility and resume operations.

It was built in 1909 as part of the extensive Poland Spring Resort, and was originally floated on Middle Pond on pontoons. It was set permanently on land in the 1930s, and converted into a private residence in the 1980s. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. Description and history The former Poland Spring Beach House stands on the south side of Maine Street (SR 26), on a narrow isthmus separating Middle Range Pond (to the south) and Lower Range Pond (to the north). It is a shingled two story wood frame structure, with a hip-roofed central section flanked by single-story wings, each also covered by a hip roof. The central section is topped by a cupola, and has wide porches extending across its width on both sides. The porch features scroll-sawn decorative elements, including balusters and brackets on the cornice. The porch on the lake side has been enclosed. On the inside, the wings, which originally housed changing areas, have had partitions removed to create living spaces as part of the building's conversion to residential use. Despite this and other alterations, the building interior retains a significant number of period Colonial Revival and Late Victorian features. The Poland Spring resort complex was developed on the east side of Middle Range Pond in the second half of the 19th century, capitalizing on claims of restorative cures provided by waters from a spring, still in use today by the Poland Spring bottling operation. Its principal feature, the Poland Spring House, declined in the 20th century and burned in 1975. This beach house was built in 1909, and was originally floated on Middle Range Pond on pontoons during the busy summer tourist season. In the 1930s, it was permanently sited at its present location at the northern end of the lake. It remained in use as a beach house until the 1970s, when it was converted to private residential use.

With a construction date traditionally given as 1770, this Greek Revival house is claimed to be the oldest in Durham, built by one of its early settlers, who also operated an inn on the premises. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on March 22, 1996. Description and history The house is set on the east side of a rural stretch of Royalsborough Road (Maine State Route 136), just south of its junction with Quaker Meeting House Road and Rabbit Road. The main block, which faces south, is a large 2-1/2 story wood-framed structure, five bays wide, with a side gable roof, clapboard and shingle siding, and a granite foundation. A single-story ell extends to the rear of the main block, parallel to the road. The main facade is almost symmetrically arranged, with a center entrance that has sidelights and modest Greek Revival trim, but the window above the entrance is slightly off-center. The windows on this side are topped by gabled lintels. The interior features relatively restrained Greek Revival styling, the most elaborate of which is found on the central staircase. The house is traditionally given a construction date of 1770, making the Durham's oldest house. However, the Greek Revival styling suggests either a later construction date or a major renovation in the 19th century before 1850. It is possible that the attached ell is at least in part the original 1770 structure, and there is some evidence in the main block of material reuse from that period. The main basement has the foundation of a large central chimney, an 18th-century feature not found in the present house. The property was settled in 1770 by O. Israel Bagley, when the area was known as Royalsborough. He was a prominent figure, operating a grist mill, shoe factory, and the community's first store, as well as operating an inn from his house. The property was acquired in 1836 by Charles Bliss, who established a dairy farm, and was probably responsible for the Greek Revival alterations to the house. The house remained in the Bliss family into the 1970s. It was carefully restored in 1982, and now serves as a bed and breakfast inn.

Description The Big Ram Site is located on Ram Island, one of a small cluster of islands in the Androscoggin River roughly downriver from Maine State Route 219. The soil of the wooded island is sandy, and is subject to occasional flooding that leaves additional deposits. The site on the island was identified by survey in 1987, at which time it was subjected to test excavations. In addition to artifacts found at the site, there is evidence of at least one habitation layer from which charcoal and fire-cracked rocks were removed. Stone artifacts recovered include flakes of quartz and rhyolite, while burnt seeds and ceramic pottery fragments were also found. The ceramics, which were not datable in the present context, are consistent with finds from other, datable, sites representing two separate periods of occupation. The first, a find with a smooth surface and dentate markings, is similar to finds dated elsewhere to the Middle Woodland Period ( CE), while another fragment, with an incised exterior, is similar to Late Woodland or early contact-period finds ( CE).

The bay is located in Nares Strait northwest of Judge Daly Promontory and is an inlet into the northeastern shore of Ellesmere Island. Fort Conger‚Äîformerly an Arctic exploration camp‚Äîis located on its northern shore.  Geography  Lady Franklin Bay divides Grant Land to the north from Grinnell Land to the south. Lady Franklin Bay is in a generally northeast to southwest direction, and as such it spreads inland about from Hall Basin. The main bay contains one noted branch to the northwest known as Discovery Bay, and the interior lengths of Lady Franklin Bay extending southwest are sometimes shown on maps as Archer Fjord. The landscape surrounding Lady Franklin Bay is generally barren rocks, with some very shallow glacial till held in place with frost and permafrost. At this location, about above the Arctic Circle, sunlight is limited to perhaps three months of a year, snowfall is light, and water in the bay is icebound from year to year, with just chance openings allowing only difficult navigation. The off-and-on icebound conditions are well-known to exist in the sea during peak summer times as far as south of the Bay entrance. However, the glaciers and icecaps of Ellesmere Island have not been known to inundate Lady Franklin Bay. The main reach of this bay can be approached by ship if ice floe conditions allow, via Baffin Bay, to Smith Sound, to Kane Basin, through Kennedy Channel, and thus through Hall Basin to the entrance of the Bay. The historically favored point for beginning such Polar trips has been St. Johns. The climate is typical Arctic Margin, with very light precipitation, short cold summers, and long cold winters in darkness. The summer natural food game observed at this Bay is limited to various mammals in the sea water, occasional muskox, and scattered sea birds seen overhead. Plants are limited to short season mosses and lichens.  History  Lady Franklin Bay is named for Lady Franklin, wife of famous British explorer Sir John Franklin, who vanished from Baffin Bay beyond Lancaster Sound on in 1845 while attempting to trace the Northwest Passage. Sir John was lost within the Elizabeth Islands south of Ellesmere Island. Lady Franklin subsequently became internationally well known by financing several different rescue expeditions to search for Sir John. Lady Franklin Bay reached press headlines in the United States in the period 1880‚Äì1884 after the US Army Signal Corps chose and specified that site for a base camp to make an attempt to reach the North Pole. A party of 25 military men led by First Lieutenant Adolphus W. Greely as acting signal officer was successfully landed by the USS Proteus at Lady Franklin Bay in August 1881. A large frame structure was built on the northwest shore, and this home base camp was named Fort Conger.  References   Sources  * Greely, A. W. (1886).

The Godiva Procession is an annual procession in the city of Coventry, England, which re-enacts the story of Lady Godiva. They have been held in Coventry since the 17th century. History The first written record of the Godiva Processions is in the Coventry City Annals of 1678. These celebrate and re-enact Godiva's legendary naked ride through Coventry, undertaken to persuade her husband to free the people of the city from the burden of oppressive tolls. Although Godiva certainly existed, the historicity of the ride itself is debated. Godiva, or Godgifu, meaning 'God's Gift', was the wife of Leofric, Earl of Mercia. Apart from references to her donations of land and gifts, there are no mentions to Godiva in contemporary chronicles. The first mention of the ride was over 150 years after her death, and appeared in Wendover's Flores Historiarum in 1190, though this survives only in a fourteenth-century manuscript. In 1217/18 Henry III granted the Charter for the Great Fair in Coventry, the event with which the Godiva Procession came to be associated. The charter stated that the fair was to begin on the feast day of the Holy Trinity, and continue for eight days. Such a fair would be of great economic benefit to the city and was usually celebrated with a parade by the civic authorities. However, it was over four centuries later that a representative of Godiva was introduced to this procession. Seventeenth Century The Coventry Corporation records provide the earliest record of the Godiva Procession: > In this year (1677-8), in the Mayoralty of Mr Michael Earle, there was a new > show on the summer, or Great Fair, of followers- that is boys sent out by > the several companies, and each Company having new Streamers, and Lady > Godiva rode before the Mayor to proclaim the Fair. The son of James Swinnerton took the part of Lady Godiva in this procession, and a medal was later struck to commemorate the event. By 19th century the Godiva procession was firmly attached to the eight-day-long Coventry Fair. In June 1824, Ann Rollason's Coventry Mercury described the mayor, magistrates and Charter Officers, as well as numerous societies and children following Godiva in procession. The scale of the procession grew in the following years, and by 1829, the programme describes the order of the procession: led by city guards, St George, bugles and city banners, then Lady Godiva, followed by the civic leaders and staff, numerous bands, Companies such as carpenters and blacksmiths, each with their own banners and followers, then the many Benefit Societies, with their bands and followers. Towards the rear came Woolcombers representing the wool trade in the city, together with the mythical Jason with his Golden Fleece and drawn sword. Nineteenth Century The first procession that encouraged the idea of Godiva riding naked was probably in 1842, when she wore a tight fitting, flesh coloured dress, causing fights among spectators trying to get a better view. By 1845, due to complaints about the procession, the Mayor, William Clark, promised to stop the event ‚Äòwhich has too long disgraced our city‚Äô. The Coventry Herald, 25 April 1845, quoted a statement signed by all the main church leaders in the city regretting a proposal ‚Äòduring the approaching fair, to get up a procession similar in character to those by which the streets of this City were disgraced in 1842 and 1844‚Äô. Despite this, the procession did go ahead that year, and Godiva wore 'a tunic of white satin' and a 'girdle of the same kind' over her flesh coloured dress, with scarves thrown across her shoulders, a mantle, sleeves and a headdress with ostrich feathers. After 1862 processions were held less frequently and did not reach the earlier level of notoriety. Twentieth Century For a long time, the names of the women who impersonated Lady Godiva were not made public and by the beginning of 20th Century, an actress was usually employed. Godiva processions were held every three to seven years, and were sometimes organised to celebrate special occasions. In 1902, in the procession marking the coronation of Edward VII, Vera Guedes, from the London Hippodrome, rode as Godiva. To celebrate the coronation of George V in 1911, the actress Miss Viola Hamilton rode in the procession, led for the first time by a nun, with 23,000 school children in the parade, and hundreds more dressed as various historical characters. In 1919, Lady Godiva appeared in the full dress robes of a Saxon countess, with even her horse wearing trousers. This was Miss Gladys Mann, the first Coventry girl to act the role. The first time a non-actress rode in the procession was in the Coventry Hospital Pageant in 1929, when Muriel Mellerup from Gloucestershire was Lady Godiva. The first Post war Godiva pageant was in 1951 for the Festival of Britain. There were sixty tableaux illustrating historical and industrial aspects. The organiser, Mr Leonard Turner, obtained 1500 period costumes, for tableaux which included the visit of Henry VII to Coventry in 1500 and a representation of the elephant and castle coat of arms, which included real elephants. The 5-mile- long procession was led by a London student and actress, Ann Wrigg, portraying Lady Godiva, surrounded by the now traditional lines of nuns. The procession in 2007. During the second half of the 20th century the Godiva aspect was lost and was replaced by Coventry Carnival. With the loss of the large firms and their apprentice schools in Coventry, this carnival dwindled and eventually ceased. However, in 1997 the Godiva procession was revived and in 2000 Coventry Carnival returned with arts group inspired costumes and tableaux. In 2003 the two combined to become the Godiva Carnival Procession which is associated with the three-day Godiva Festival held in Coventry's War Memorial Park.

At , the tunnel is the longer of the two oldest railway tunnels in Queensland, the other being known as the 'Six Chain', either because it is long, or is situated entirely on a radius curve, or both. Both are situated on the Main Line from Brisbane to Toowoomba, being part of the first narrow gauge main line in the world.Kerr, J. 'Triumph of Narrow Gauge' Boolarong Publications 1990 The Victoria Tunnel was named in honour of Queen Victoria, the reigning Australian monarch at the time of the tunnel's construction. History The tunnel (together with 'Six Chain') was built through the Little Liverpool Range on a section of narrow gauge railway from Grandchester to Gatton. The railway opened in June 1866, being delayed when the excavation of the tunnel revealed unexpected geological difficulties, requiring the tunnel to be lined with 3 layers of bricks. That resulted in the tunnel having restricted clearances, which limits the loading gauge (size of rolling stock) on this section of the Queensland Railways network, and the floor of the tunnel was lowered by in 1985 to improve that situation. Tunnel floor lowering There are a total of 11 single track tunnels on the line between Ipswich and Toowoomba, all built around the same time in 1865, all with a tight profile that are too small to take ISO shipping containers. It is now proposed to improve the loading gauge of these tunnels by lowering the floors.

It sits on a small piece of land in the middle of the street known locally as the Triangle. At different times during the Revolutionary War, George Washington and Rochambeau encamped the Continental Army near the memorial site for brief periods. A cannon from that war had been placed on the Triangle in 1908 with the intent of starting a memorial to the village's dead from the Civil War, but only after World War I was the monument finished and dedicated. Plaques have been added since then to honor those locally who served and sometimes gave their lives in World War II, Korea and Vietnam. Memorial The two most prominent features of the memorial are a small cannon and a zinc statue of a doughboy. Both sit on a slightly elevated granite base. Next to the stone bed of the cannon is a plaque stating that it was used in the Battle of Long Island in 1777. The doughboy is depicted in a heroic, defiant pose, with his shirt open and his helmet off, on the adjacent ground. Originally he was carrying a Springfield rifle with bayonet in his left hand; it has been replaced following the theft of the original. He stands atop a white pedestal, with plaques listing Suffern's dead from the different wars memorialized on each facet. History The heirs of village founder John Suffern bought the cannon in 1851 and ritually fired it from the top of nearby Union Hill on Independence Day of every year, as well as for special events like the completion of the Erie Railroad across New York State in 1852. They donated the cannon to the village in 1908 to use as the latter saw fit, and the Village Board decided to place it on the Triangle. A local stonemason was paid $65 to build the granite platform, and the village granted a \\"perpetual privilege\\" to a local Union Army veterans' group to establish a memorial. At the time, however, the village's mayor was not popular, and one of the complaints against him was the establishment of the memorial, which his critics likened to a fort. Efforts to delay or outright cancel the memorial failed but delayed the completion and formal dedication of the project. Only after the United States had fought another war did interest in completing the memorial resurface, and in April 1921 the board authorized construction. The J.W. Fiske Iron Works of New York City cast a version of a statue it had erected elsewhere, in zinc (seen as a cheaper alternative to bronze). The focus on an ordinary soldier was part of a growing trend in war memorials of that era to shift emphasis from a commander or hero to the common man and woman on the line. It was dedicated on Memorial Day of that year. The village has held its ceremonies for that holiday at the monument ever since. The only change to the memorial besides the additional plaques for wars later in the 20th century was the theft of the original rifle in 1968, possibly as an act of protest against the war in Vietnam. In 2006 the monument and Triangle were listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Marian music is now an inherent element in many aspects of the veneration of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Roman Catholic Mariology. Throughout the centuries Marian music has grown and progressed, and witnessed a resurgence along with the Renaissance, e.g. with the composition of the Ave Maria motet by Josquin des Prez. The tradition continued with a number of great composers up to the late 19th century, e.g. with Giuseppe Verdi's Ave Maria in 1880 followed by his Laudi alla Vergine Maria. Saint Ambrose One of the oldest Marian intonations is credited to Saint Ambrose of Milan (339-374). The Church names an ancient liturgy after him (Ambrosian Rite), which is actually older but nonetheless traditionally attributed to him.Paredi, Marienlexikon, 176 Some 870 parishes in the diocese of Milan still use the ancient Ambrosian rite. Several Ambrosian rite Marian texts were intonated, for example the famous Gaude:Paredi 176 :Gaude et latare :Exultation angelorum :Gaude domini virgo :Prophetarum gaudium :Gaudeas benedicta :Dominus tecum est :Gaude, que per angelum gaudium mundi suscepisti :Gaude que genuisti factorum et Dominum :Gaudeas que dignas es esse mater Christi'' Marian hymns by Ambrose include the Confractorium from the Christmas liturgy and in a poetic creation of Saint Ambrose celebrating the Mother of God: Intende, qui Regis Israel.Paredi 177 Marian music for the Liturgy of the Hours upright=1.5 One of the earliest medieval Marian compositions is the popular Salve Regina in Latin from a Benedictine monk at the Reichenau Island (Lake Constance), which exists in several Gregorian versions. The liturgy of the hour includes several offices to be sung. At the close of the Office, one of four Marian antiphons is sung. These songs, Alma Redemptoris Mater, Ave Regina caelorum, Regina caeli, and Salve Regina, have been described as \\"among the most beautiful creations of the late Middle Ages.\\"Willi Apel, Gregorian Chant p. 404. Other Marian supplications exist in numerous Latin versions as well.(Sub tuum praesidium, Seven Dolours of the Virgin, Seven Joys of the Virgin ) It is difficult to trace the beginning of non-Gregorian Marian liturgical music. In the year 1277 Pope Nicholas III prescribed rules for liturgy in Roman churches.B√§umer, 652 Three years later, in 1280, Petrus de Cruce published his Marian anthem Ave virgo regia, Ave gloriosa O maria Maris stella. Later, composer P√©rotin followed with his Alleluja, Navitatis gloriosae virginis, to be sung at the feast of the birth of Mary. Marian motets became very popular in the Middle Ages, a large collection of which is in St. Paul Cathedral in London. Pope John XXII (1316‚Äì34) issued the apostolic constitution Docta SS Patrum about Church music. It was the first modern music regulations for musical presentation during the liturgy Monteverdi's Vespro della Beata Vergine contains distinctly Marian texts among its 13 movements, though the composer's intention for the work as a whole is debated. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart composed in honour of the Virgin Mary Latin Masses and several shorter operas.Dixit & Magnificat KV 193: C-Major, Regina Coeli KV 108: C- Major, Regina Coeli KV 127: B- Major, Graduale Sancta Maria KV 273, Offertorium Alma Dei creatoris KV 277, Litaniae de Beata Maria Virgine KV 109 Other known classic composers with Marian compositions mainly in Latin include Orlando di Lasso and Franz Schubert. Vivaldi, Monteverdi, Mozart, Haydn, and others are well-known composers who contributed to Marian music. Less known is the fact that before 1802, the secularisation, many religious congregations had their own composers.In Germany, in the monastery of Andechs, Father Nonnosus Madleder, in Ottobeuren, Father Franx Schnizer, in Irsee Father Meinrad Spiess, and in Banz A totally unknown Father Valentin Rathgeber, OSB, (1682‚Äì1750) wrote 43 Masses, 164 offertories, 24 concerts, and 44 Marian antiphones. Missa de Beata Virgine and the Messe de Nostre Dame are examples of individual contributions. Monteverdi's Vespro della Beata Vergine has remained structurally unchanged for the past 1500 years. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart composed in honour of the Virgin Mary Latin Masses and several shorter operas.Dixit & Magnificat KV 193: C-Major, Regina Coeli KV 108: C- Major, Regina Coeli KV 127: B- Major, Graduale Sancta Maria KV 273, Offertorium Alma Dei creatoris KV 277, Litaniae de Beata Maria Virgine KV 109 Other known classic composers with Marian compositions mainly in Latin include Orlando di Lasso and Franz Schubert. Marian plays and songs In 12th century France the tradition began of Christmas dramas, in which the nativity events are reproduced by actors. This became popular in other European countries and is seen as the origin of popular Christmas carols, which were an integral part of the Christmas drama. These early Christmas songs are largely devotions to the Mother of God. Early manifestations are in Bavaria in the 12th century.Kloster Benediktbeuren, Seckau, At the same time, Easter songs are often converted into Marian hymns, for example the hymn Te virgini Mariae laudes concinant Christianae. The assumption of Mary is praised in numerous songs from the 10th century,Ave dei genitrx ‚Ä¶cuius nunc regni dominando, tu possides ut mater filii. In several songs, Mary is praised to be above all saints and angels and participates in the kingdom of her son. Her assumption is ‚Äúwished by the faithful people‚Äù in a song from the 12th century.Exulta exaltata, Gottschalk von Limburg The Marian songs and hymns in this epoch are too numerous to mention. They include pious excitement, even some exaggerations, and valuable insights into the Marian belief, especially in the assumption. Ave, salve, and gaude hymns Examples of Ave (Hail Mary) songs include:M√§umker, Kirchenlieder aus dem 12th Jahrhundert, : Ave dei genitrix, caelstium terrestrium infernorum domina; : Ave spes mundi, Maria, ave mitis, ave pia : Ave plena, signulari gratia Examples of Salve songs include: :Salve regina, mater misericordiae : Salve prodis Davidis : Salve Mater Misericordiae Gaude (Rejoice) hymns include: :Gaude Maria templum summae majestatis :Gaude mater luminis :Gaude, plaude, clara Rosa Vale (farewell) and Mater dolorosa (mother of sorrows) are also subjects of numerous Marian hymns.Engelhardt, Marienkunde, 1336 Holy Mass music It seems that settings of the Ordinary of the Mass are a latter development than Liturgy of the Hours music . Modern Kyriales designate two Gregorian chant Mass settings for Marian feasts, In solemnitatibus et Festis Beatae Mariae Virginis and in Festis et Memoriis.Graduale Romanum, Kyriale IX And X. Before the Council of Trent the Gloria of the first of these contained the trope Spiritus et alme orphanorum paraclete, heard in Josquin's Missa de Beata Virgine but not in Machault's Messe de Nostre Dame which was written as a Votive Mass. The list of compositions by Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina includes numerous Marian masses: * Missa Salve Regina * Missa Alma Redemptoris * Missa Assumpta est Maria * Missa Regina coeli * Missa de beata Virgine * Missa Ave Regina coelorum * Missa Descendit Angelus Domini * Missa O Virgo simul et Mater Marian music during the Baroque period The Marian music in the baroque period is strongly influenced by the Latin tradition, but develops its own characteristics. Marian songs venerate her exceptional sanctity. Many Marian songs have the form of litanies, expressing veneration of Mary. Others moralize the faithful in light of her virtuous life.B√ºse, Marienkunde,585 In Poland and Hungary, baroque Marian compositions stress her national protective powers for the Polish and Hungarian nation, an aspect largely missing in Italy, France, and Germany, where Mary is likely to be called upon to protect a city or region rather than a nation.B√ºse 585 Many Latin Marian hymns are now translated into a vernacular language, especially in Germany under the influence of Lutheran use of the vernacular in liturgy. Latin texts are often enriched with flowery reverences and Marian praises. Like Marian poetry, Marian music has flourished most in Italy, Spain, Portugal, and France, countries uninfluenced by the reformation.B√ºse 589 Before the German secularisations of 1802 many religious congregations had their own composers. In the monastery of Andechs, Father Nonnosus Madleder, in Ottobeuren, Father Franx Schnizer, in Irsee, Father Meinrad Spiess, and in Banz, Father Valentin Rathgeber, OSB, (1682‚Äì1750): 43 Masses, 164 offertories, 24 concerts, and 44 Marian antiphones. Marian music in the Enlightenment era Besides the above-mentioned Vespers, Joseph Haydn wrote several Marian compositions including two famous Marian Masses, the Missa Cellensis in honorem Beatissimae Virginis Mariae, No. 5 in E flat major, also known as the Grosse Orgelmesse (Great Organ Mass) (H. 22/4) (1766) and the Missa Cellensis in honorem Beatissimae Virginis Mariae No. 3 in C major (H. 22/5) (1766‚Äì73).  Romantic Marian music  Several motets by Anton Bruckner are related to Mary, including three settings of Ave Maria. Max Reger composed the motet Unser lieben Frauen Traum in 1914.  Contemporary Marian music  Francis Poulenc composed Litanies √† la Vierge Noire and a Stabat Mater in 1950. Arvo P√§rt composed several works related to Mary, including a Magnificat in 1989 and a Salve Regina in 2001. The Franciscan Helmut Schlegel wrote in 2009 a hymn, \\"Glauben k√∂nnen wie du\\", addressing Mary and wanting to imitate her virtues faith, hope and love. It was included in 2015 in an oratorio, Laudato si', which narrates stations of her life, quoting the Magnificat.

Flanking it are two other buildings associated with the camp meeting: Porter Hall and B.C. Jordan Memorial Hall. It is a two-story wood frame structure, capped by an octagonal hip roof whose elements meet at a central cupola. It is finished in wooden clapboards and rests on a foundation of brick piers. The main facade, facing south, is three bays wide, with a central projecting entry section topped by a doubled gable roof. This section has a double door on the first level and a double sash window above, while the flanking bays have single sash windows. The east and west-facing walls have similar organization, but only a single gable roof. The north wall has a low storage area projecting from it. The interior of the building is a large open hall, with the speaker's platform on the north wall, and seating, much of it original, arrayed facing it. The Temple in 2014 The idea of an oceanfront camp meeting community arose at a meeting of Free Will Baptists in Weirs Beach, New Hampshire in 1880. Land was acquired in northern Saco (which Old Orchard Beach was then still part of), and summer cottages were soon built. This building was constructed in 1881 by James Bickford to a design by Dow & Wheeler, inspired in part by the popularization of octagon houses by Orson Squire Fowler in the 1840s and 1850s. The Temple continues to be a central focus of the summer community in Ocean Park.

The complex consists of three buildings: the brick church building, which was built in 1834; the old vestry, a brick building standing near the street which was built c. 1835 as a school and converted to a vestry in 1878; and the new vestry, a wooden structure added in 1899 to join the two brick buildings together. The church, a fine vernacular Federal style building when it was built, had its interior extensively restyled in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983, primarily as a good example of modest Victorian church architecture. It now houses the Ashland Community Church. Description and history The First Free Will Baptist Church stands in the village of Ashland, on the south side of Main Street (United States Route 3) between Water and Pleasant Streets. The church, a single-story brick building, stands atop a knoll that overlooks the center of the village. It is covered by a gabled roof oriented with the ridge parallel to the street, with a steepled tower and main entrance at the eastern end. The old vestry is a 2-1/2 story brick building, whose gabled roof is placed gable-end to the street. It has a three-bay facade with the entrance at the center, framed by sidelight and transom windows. The new vestry is built against the rears of these two buildings. A Free Will Baptist congregation was established in what is today Ashland in 1818, when it was still part of Holderness. By 1830, the congregation had grown large enough to warrant a dedicated sanctuary, which was built in 1834. Details of its original form are sketchy, because it underwent a series of alterations to both its exterior and interior between 1872 and 1915. These rendered the building into one that is essentially entirely Late Victorian in character, with arched stained glass windows, shingling in the tower stages, and other features reflective of that period. The old vestry was built about 1835, and is typical of period academy buildings. This one was used to house a school and the vestry, the latter use in exchange for its siting on church-owned land. The academy building was purchased outright by the church in 1878, and the new vestry building was added in 1899.

He was initially a member of the Labor Party, but after the 1916 party split joined the National Labor Party and then the Nationalist Party.  Early life  He was born in Airdrie, Scotland on 24 March 1859. He was a son of coal miner Archibald Hamilton de Largie and his wife Mary, n√©e McLaren, both of whom died while he was very young. De Largie, a devout Roman Catholic, left school in 1869, at the age of 10 years old to work in the Lanarkshire mines, where he became involved in the labour movement.De Garis (2000) \\"De Largie, Hugh (1859-1947)\\" The Biographical Dictionary of the Australian Senate Vol 1 1901-1929 Melbourne University Press: Melbourne .  Union activism  De Largie married Mary McGregor in Glasgow in 1884 and they migrated first to Queensland in 1887 then to Newcastle in New South Wales where, in addition to mining, de Largie acted as a union delegate and secretary of the local branches of the Australian Socialist League and the Labor Electoral League. De Largie's union activities eventually led to his ban from working as a miner in Newcastle, forcing him to move to the Western Australian goldfields in 1896. In Kalgoorlie, de Largie continued his involvement in the labour movement, taking a leading role in the January 1897 amalgamation of a number of mining unions into the Amalgamated Workers Union (AWA), serving as its foundation president. Under de Largie's presidency, the AWA became the most important union in the colony. De Largie's role with the AWA led to his prominence in labour politics and de Largie was elected president of the goldfields division of the joint Labor parliamentary committee in April 1899 and inaugural chair of the Western Australian Trades Union and Labor Congress.  Political career  De Largie in 1908 De Largie campaigned for Federation and became the official goldfields Senate candidate of the Western Australian labour movement at the inaugural federal election in 1901. Described as \\"an equable, humourless person\\" who spoke in a 'plain and fearless fashion' with a pronounced Scots accent, Senator de Largie advocated the White Australia Policy, old age pensions for white people, protectionism and a state bank. In 1907 he warned that Western Australia was in anti-Federation mood due to the lack of a transnational railway and in 1909 announced his support for compulsory military service, arguing that the Boers lost their independence because they were unable to defend themselves. De Largie served as Labor whip in the Senate from 1907 to 1914. He was government whip from 1910 to 1913 and 1917 to 1922. During World War I, de Largie argued strongly in favour of conscription and saw Western Australia voted for conscription during the referenda on the matter. As a result, de Largie followed Australian Prime Minister Billy Hughes out of the Australian Labor Party in the conscription split of 1916.McMullin, R. (1991) The Light on the Hill: the Australian Labor Party 1891-1991, Oxford University Press. de Largie became first a member of the National Labor Party before joining the Nationalist Party of Australia. De Largie lost his seat at the 1922 election.  Later years  In retirement de Largie remained in Melbourne and set up the Association of Members of the First Federal Parliament. In 1940 he moved to Sydney. He died in Randwick on 9 May 1947 as one of the last survivors of the first federal parliament.Cusack, D.

Early life  John de Martelly was born in 1903 in Philadelphia and studied at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, in Florence, Italy, as well as the Royal College of Art in London. In the 1930s and 1940s, he taught printmaking at the Kansas City Art Institute to the same students who studied painting with Thomas Hart Benton.  Works  De Martelly became a close friend of Benton, and was influenced by his Regionalist style. When Benton was fired from the Art Institute, the Board of Governors offered de Martelly Benton‚Äôs job as head of the Painting Department. De Martelly was furious and quit. De Martelly‚Äôs lithographs, sold through the Associated American Artists Galleries in New York in the 1930s and 1940s, captured the essence of the rural American landscape. In 1943, de Martelly began teaching at Michigan State University in East Lansing, where he was named artist-in- residence in 1946. By the late 1940s, de Martelly abandoned Regionalism for Abstract Expressionism and closely studied Daumier.  Death  He died in 1979.

During those years, she primarily served the coast of Fire Island in New York and the Nantucket Shoals, though she was a relief vessel and served as needed in other locations off the northeast coast as well. From 1898 to her sinking in 1905, she was occasionally used as a lighthouse tender. In the course of her brief career, LV58 suffered two accidents. On July 19, 1904, she was rammed by a steamer while relieving Pollock Rip Lightship LV47. The second accident was more severe. On December 10, 1905, LV58 was sent to relieve Nantucket Lightship LV66 during a storm. Due to a leak in the fire-room, and a subsequent failure of suction pumps, the boilers became flooded. A distress signal was sent and the crew was forced to bail out water by hand for 24 hours before Captain Gibbs and arrived to tow them in for repairs. After four hours of towing, the crew was forced to abandon ship and she went down off the coast of Nantucket. The fallout of this incident caused a small public uproar. Under Navy rules, the eleven officers and crew members of LV58 were denied pay while they were recovering from their injuries and until they were posted to new vessels. This situation was appealed to Captain Uriel Sebree, who served as head of the Lighthouse Board at the time, but he did not or was not able to accommodate the situation. Instead, the officers would be given commendations by Secretary Victor H. Metcalf and \\"preference in future appointments\\" only. Admiral George Dewey and Sebree also made a recommendation, which was approved, that Captain Gibbs receive a commendation and a pay increase for his service. This incident marked in the first time in US naval history that a distress message was transmitted by radio. LV58 had one of the first Marconi radios installed for testing in 1901 and it was brought into full-time use in 1904.

State Highway 1 runs through the area. The Tuamarina River joins the Wairau River just south of the settlement. Picton is about 18 km to the north, and Blenheim is about 10 km to the south. Thesettlement had a usual resident population of 237 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 15 people (6.8%) since the 2013 census, and a decrease of 30 people (‚àí11.2%) since the 2006 census. The name is a corruption of the MƒÅori word Tuamarino, which means 'the calm beyond'. Dairy farming is the major economic activity, and the Koromiko cheese factory won a number of awards before it was destroyed by fire in 2004. The Wairau Affray occurred in the area in 1843, resulting in 26 deaths. The Wairau Plain is prone to flooding, and river conservation is necessary to keep the river under control. Significant floods have occurred in the Tuamarina area, such as one in December 1939.

It is probably a Northumbrian piece, written in prose and verse, where the former serves either as a set of stage directions for a dramatic portrayal or as a series of narrations for explaining the poetry. Three voices appear in the work: those of Adam, Eve, and a narrator. The prose of the \\"narrator\\" appears in the Book of Cerne in red ink setting it off from the rest of the text. The prose portions are rhythmic and may therefore have been sung, even if they were primarily directorial. Besides the three main soloists, the piece was designed for a full choir (antiqui iusti). The piece may be either an early oratorio or the earliest surviving piece of Christian drama intended to be performed. The Harrowing of Hell has two sources: a lost Latin homily, which survives in translation as the seventh of the Old English Blickling Homilies,This itself draws on homily 160 of Pseudo-Augustine. and a Roman psalter also in the Book of Cerne. David Dumville (1972) provides a critical edition of the Latin text and Dronke (1994) provides some English translation. The fifty-five lines recount how Jesus Christ descended into hell to release the \\"prisoners\\", the just who were held by Satan. In typical medieval representations of this event, Adam and Eve are released immediately, but in the Harrowing of Hell they must wait and beg before they too are finally saved. The plea of Eve goes as follows: { :Iustus est, domine, et rectum iudicium tuum, :quia merito haec patior, :nam ego, cum in honore essem, no intellexi ... :Ne avertas faciem misericordiae tuae a me, :et ne declines in ira ab ancilla tua!  :You are just, Lord, and your judgement is unswerving, :for I suffer this deservedly, :since, when I was in honour, I did not understand ... :Do not turn the face of your mercy away from me, :do not, in anger, shun your handmaiden. } The piece ends abruptly here, the rest apparently being lost, but if a comparable Old English piece is any indication, Eve's plea is successful.

He is specialized on Fisheries History, Traditional Watercraft and Museum Ships, Methodology of Maritime History and interdisciplinary research projects. Academic education and professional positions Heidbrink studied Social and Economic History at the University of Hamburg (Germany), where he got his M.A. in 1994 and his Dr.phil. in 1999. His doctoral thesis on German inland-waterway tanker-shipping was supervised by Ulrich Troitzsch as well as his earlier MA-thesis on traditional watercraft. In 2004 he finished his habilitation (German professorial degree) at the University of Bremen (Germany) with a thesis on the history of German deep-sea fishing industry in the 20th century.Informationsdienst Wissenschaft After positions at various maritime museums in Germany Heidbrink became the founding head of the department of fisheries history at the German Maritime Museum / Deutsches Schiffahrtsmuseum in Bremerhaven in 1996. From 2000 to 2002 he was a research fellow at the Hanse Institute for Advanced Study (HWK) in Delmenhorst. Hereafter he returned to the German Maritime Museum. Since 2000 he taught at the University of Bremen where he became Privatdozent in 2004 and one of the Principal Investigators of the Bremen International Graduate School for Marine Sciences ‚Äì Global Change in the Marine Realm (GLOMAR). In 2003 and 2007 he was guest lecturer at the Ilisimatusarfik, the University of Greenland. In 2008 he was appointed Associate Professor for Maritime History at the History Department of Old Dominion University in Norfolk, VA, where he was Graduate Program Director of the history program from 2009 to 2013. In summer 2010 he was promoted to Professor of History. Heidbrink has been selected as a research fellow at the Rachel Carson Center at the University of Munich, a newly established federal think tank for environmental history. Beside his academic career he holds a masters license for commercial watercraft on inland waterways and is an appointed surveyor for historical watercraft and museum ships in Germany. Scholarly work Heidbrink‚Äôs scholarly work is dedicated to several sub-topics of maritime history: Since the mid-1990s he dealt intensively with the theoretical framework behind the restoration and operation of museum ships and traditional vessels. His most important contribution to this particular field of research was that he authored together with Arne Gotved and John Robinson the ‚ÄúBarcelona Charter ‚Äì European Charter for the Conservation and Restoration of traditional ships in operation‚Äù which was adopted by the European association of owners of such vessels (European Maritime Heritage) in 2003 and is recognized as an international standard for such vessels by many European governments. Towards the end of the 1990s Heidbrink‚Äôs research was mainly dedicated to the history of European inland-waterway navigation and his book on inland-waterway tanker navigation became standard for this field of research.Uni-Protokolle Since 2000 his publications mainly focus on fisheries history and the Law of the Sea and especially his book on the fishing conflicts of the 20th century was discussed controversial, because he stated that the European distant-water fisheries of the late 19th and 20th century have been a kind of common economic colonialism in the North Atlantic area. Beside this concrete research he dealt with the methodological improvement of maritime history and is part of a movement that wants to widen the scope of maritime history to a universal history of the interaction of humans and the oceans. Report on future research topics for world history As a part of this methodological work he was involved in the design of new scholarly educational schemes that combine marine sciences with the humanities and social sciences and were realized for example in the Bremen International Graduate School for Marine Sciences ‚Äì Global Change in the Marine Realm (GLOMAR) or the Mitigation and Adaption Research Institute (MARI) at Old Dominion University. International scholarly organizations Heidbrink is involved in a variety of international organizations dedicated to research in Maritime History. In 2005 he was elected to Assistant Secretary General of the International Commission for Maritime History (ICMH). In September 2009 he took over as Acting Secretary General of the ICMH after the previous Secretary General stepped back from the office and was elected to Secretary General in August 2010.

It is widely distributed from the Orange River boundary of Namaqualand to beyond the Kei River in the Eastern Cape. \\"Tetragona\\" comes from the phyllotaxy of the leaves. It is popularly named the \\"miniature pine tree\\" among ornamental plant enthusiasts, for its popular use as a \\"pine tree\\" in Bonsai.  Description  The decumbent stems of Crassula tetragona subsp. acutifolia The plant is erect or spreads shrubless to 1 m (3 ft). It has woody stems with brown bark, with crossed pairs of leaves. Leaves are green to dark green in color. The plant features terminal inflorescence ending in white flowers that come up in summer. The chromosome number varies: 2n=16, 32, 48. The subspecies are separated geographically, generally with only one subspecies per geographic area. Taxonomy The species was first described by Linnaeus in 1753 in his book Species PlantarumLinnaeus, C.F. 1753 Species Plantarum. There are six recognized subspecies, originally named by Tolken, as follows: *C. tetragona subsp. acutifolia, stems decumbent, rooting at internodes, and sharply acute leaf apcies. *C. tetragona subsp. tetragona, plant with multiple erect branches, and densely flowered inflorescence. *C. tetragona subsp. rudis, plant with a single main erect branch, but loosely branched inflorescence. *C. tetragona subsp. connivens, young stems are papillose, rounded flower thyrse *C. tetragona subsp. lignescens, young stems are smooth, mature stems are woody, leaves relatively small. The most widespread subspecies. *C. tetragona subsp. robusta, young stems are smooth, stems all carnose, leaves are large and robust. The most commonly cultivated subspecies. Usage These plants are usually used as an ornamental, although they are believed to have been used as a medicinal plant by Thunberg, who wrote: \\"Crassula tetragona, somewhat of an stringent nature, boiled in milk, in the quantity of a handful, is used as a remedy for diarrhoea.\\"Crassula, a grower's guide, Gordon Rowley, 2003.  Growth patterns  The plant requires a reasonable amount of water; more water is needed if flower buds are present. Most species prefer full sun, although some sub-species could be sensitive to too much sun. The plant is resistant to frost, but temperatures above (6C) are best. The plant may be propagated from leaves and cuttings. It does not suffer from pests, other than the occasional mealy bug.Crassulas in cultivation, Vera Higgins, 1964, Blandford Press Ltd.

Bergin is also noted for his interchanges with probabilistic atheist Albert Ellis. Bergin was raised in a family that did not actively attend any religious services. He went to high school in Spokane, Washington, and began college at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He then transferred to Reed College. The school had four Latter-day Saints in its student body that year, one of whom was Bergin's roommate and another of whom, Marian Shafer, he began dating. The following year Shafer decided to transfer to Brigham Young University (BYU), and Bergin decided to do the same. Through interactions with BYU professor and Reed alumnus Robert K. Thomas, Bergin learned more about Mormonism and in March 1955 was baptized a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) by Thomas. After this, Bergin married Marian Shafer. Bergin eventually earned a master's degree from BYU and then a Ph.D. from Stanford University under Albert Bandura, followed by post-doctoral research at the University of Wisconsin under Carl Rogers. He then became a professor in the clinical psychology program at Teachers College, Columbia University. While on the Columbia faculty, Bergin lived in New Jersey and served as a bishop for the LDS church and later as a counselor in the Eastern States Mission Presidency. It was also while at Columbia that Bergin co-edited the Handbook of Psychotherapy and Behavior Change with Sol Garfield; the book was named a social science citation classic.Ken Shelton, \\"Allen Bergin: 'The Gospel is a Continuing Revolution against the Standards of the World'\\", Ensign, September 1983, p. 34.

It is based on the screenplay of the 1981 Bulgarian film Yo Ho Ho by Valeri Petrov. Its costume design is by Eiko Ishioka. The film was released to theaters in America and the UK in 2008 and earned $3.7 million worldwide. Plot In 1915 Los Angeles, stuntman Roy Walker (Lee Pace) is hospitalized, bedridden and possibly paralyzed after taking a jump in his first film. He meets Alexandria (Catinca Untaru), a young Romanian-born patient in the hospital who is recovering from a broken arm, and begins to tell her a story about her namesake, Alexander the Great. Alexandria is told she has to leave, but Roy promises to tell her an epic tale if she returns the next day. The next morning, as Roy spins his tale of fantasy, Alexandria's imagination brings his characters to life. Roy's tale is about five heroes: a silent Indian warrior (Jeetu Verma), a muscular ex-slave named Otta Benga (Marcus Wesley), an Italian explosives expert called Luigi (Robin Smith), Charles Darwin (Leo Bill) with a pet monkey called Wallace, and a masked swashbuckling bandit. An evil ruler named Governor Odious (Daniel Caltagirone) has committed an offense against each of the five, who all seek revenge. The heroes are later joined by a sixth hero, a mystic. Alexandria vividly imagines her friends and people around her appearing as the characters in Roy's story. Although Roy develops affection for Alexandria, he also has an ulterior motive: by gaining her trust, he tricks her into stealing morphine from the hospital pharmacy. Roy intends to use the morphine to commit suicide because the woman he loves has left him for the actor for whom he provided the stunt footage. However, Alexandria returns with only three pills. For a moment it appears as though she has eaten some of them; in actuality she threw all but three of them down the toilet, having mistaken the \\"E\\" on the piece of paper Roy gave her for a \\"3\\". The stories become a collaborative tale to which Alexandria also contributes. Alexandria herself becomes a character: while Roy is the masked bandit, she is his daughter. Roy talks Alexandria into stealing a bottle of morphine tablets locked in a fellow patient's cabinet, and then downs it all. He tells her she should leave after he takes them, but he knows she may not obey and may very well witness the death of the man she has come to view as her father. This does not come to pass, as the next morning Roy awakens from his sleep and realizes he is only alive because his neighboring patient is receiving a placebo rather than actual morphine. Alexandria, desperate to help Roy, sneaks out of bed to the pharmacy. She climbs onto the cabinet but loses her footing, falls, and sustains a severe head injury. She receives surgery, after which she is visited by Roy, where he confesses his deception. He encourages Alexandria to ask someone else to end the story, but she insists on hearing Roy's ending. Roy reluctantly begins the rest of the story. The heroes die one by one, and it seems that Governor Odious will be triumphant. Alexandria becomes upset, and Roy insists, \\"It's my story.\\" She declares that it is hers too and exerts some influence on the course of the tale. The epic tale comes to an end with only the Bandit and his daughter remaining alive and Governor Odious dying. But in one final twist, Roy, who has been crafting the story to manipulate Alexandria and cope with his anger, targets the character representing his ex-girlfriend. He blames her for orchestrating the story's pain and suffering as part of a \\"test\\" of the Bandit's love for her. The Bandit rejects her as an act of ultimate triumph. With the story complete, Roy and Alexandria, along with the patients and staff of the hospital, watch a viewing of the finished \\"flicker\\" that Roy appeared in. With everyone laughing, only Roy's smile is broken in confusion when he sees that his life- threatening jump has been edited out of the film as another stuntman jumps instead. Alexandria's arm heals and she returns to the orange orchard where her family works. Her voice-over reveals that Roy has recovered and is now back at work again. As she talks, a montage of cuts from several of silent films' greatest and most dangerous stunts plays; she imagines all the stuntmen to be Roy. Cast * Lee Pace as Roy Walker / Black Bandit * Catinca Untaru as Alexandria / Bandit's daughter * Justine Waddell as Nurse Evelyn / Sister Evelyn * Daniel Caltagirone as Sinclair / Governor Odious * Marcus Wesley as Ice delivery man / Otta Benga * Robin Smith as One-legged actor / Luigi * Jeetu Verma as Orange picker / Indian * Kim Uylenbroek as Doctor / Alexander the Great * Leo Bill as Orderly / Charles Darwin * Emil Hostina as Alexandria's father / Blue Bandit * Julian Bleach as Mystic / Orange picker * Ronald France as Otto (the \\"old man\\") Themes The Fall is a self-reflexive film that deals primarily with the concept of storytelling. Roy Walker tells a story to Alexandria, who imagines it, but there is a discontinuity between what he describes and how she sees it. Each character brings their own life into their experiences of the story; Roy takes inspiration from the film that he was working on before his accident, and Alexandria populates his story with familiar sights from her own life. The intimidating X-Ray operator becomes an enemy soldier, the 'Indian' is seen by her as an immigrant co-worker from the orange groves, while Roy's dialogue makes it clear to the audience that he meant 'Indian' to mean a Native American man from the Western film he was involved in. The Fall is also grounded in the film's historical period. Roy took inspiration for his story's bandits from early 20th century news; the controversy over credit for Charles Darwin's ideas in On the Origin of Species between Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace, as well as Ota Benga's imprisonment in the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis, Missouri were prominent news stories around the time period of the film's setting. Production According to the director's remarks on the DVD release of the film, Tarsem Singh largely financed the film with his own funds, determined to make the film according to his own vision, and paid members of the cast and crew on an equal basis rather than in more typical Hollywood fashion. Singh's commentary indicates the film was made over a period of four years and incorporates footage shot in more than 20 countries, including India, Indonesia (Bali), Italy, France, Spain, Namibia, China (PRC), and numerous others, a few of which are not listed in the credits. Singh stressed the importance of on- location filming and lack of special effects in interviews because he found that modern techniques would not age well in comparison. He reportedly only took advertising jobs in places that he wanted to do location scouting for, and would fly out cast members to shoot scenes for the film using the same crew as he did for commercials. Singh's focus on striking visuals combined with his commitment against using special effects when shooting scenes of the blue city in Jodhpur, as he provided locals with blue paint to refresh the paint on their houses. This alternative to post-production effects resulted in the vibrant blue of the city in the film. Another location, the contemporary South African mental hospital which represents an early 20th-century Los Angeles hospital (the principal setting throughout the film) remained operational (in a separate wing) during filming, according to the DVD commentaries. The DVD supplementary features reveal that actor Lee Pace remained in a bed for most of the early filming at the director's suggestion, convincing most of the crew that he was in fact unable to walk. The intention, Tarsem and Pace noted, was to maximize the realism of Roy's physical limitations in the eyes of Catinca Untaru, whose lines and reactions as the character Alexandria were largely unscripted, and so were young Catinca's spontaneous interactions with Pace's character. For example, Alexandria's misinterpreting the letter E as the number 3 in a note written by Roy came about from an accidental misreading by the 6-year-old actress during filming, which the director then realized he could adapt into a clever twist in the story. To further the realism of young Catinca's performance, Tarsem had portions of the hospital scenes between Pace and his young co-star filmed through small holes in the hospital bed curtains, maximizing the youngster's spontaneous interactions with Pace despite the presence of the film crew surrounding them.

Critical reception On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 61% approval rating based on 107 reviews, with an average rating of 6.25/10. The website's critics consensus reads, \\"More visually elaborate than the fragmented story can sometimes support, The Fall walks the line between labor of love and filmmaker self-indulgence.\\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 64 out of 100 based on 23 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Roger Ebert gave the film 4/4, and wrote, \\"You might want to see [it] for no other reason than because it exists. There will never be another like it.\\" Nathan Lee of The New York Times, however, wrote that the film \\"is a genuine labor of love‚Äîand a real bore.\\" The film appeared on several critics' top ten lists of the best films of 2008. Tasha Robinson of The A.V. Club named it the best film of 2008, Sean Axmaker of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer named it the 6th best film of 2008, and Roger Ebert of Chicago Sun-Times named it among his top 20 films of 2008.

Along with Sukhothai Historical Park and Si Satchanalai historical park, it is a part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site Historic Town of Sukhothai and Associated Historic Towns. Major features in the Kamphaeng Phet Historical Park include archaeological remains of ancient sites such as Mueang Chakangrao to the east of the Ping River, Mueang Nakhon Chum to the west and Mueang Trai Trueng some 18 km from the town to the southwest. Chakangrao, the ancient Kamphaeng Phet town, had the same town planning concept as the old Sukhothai and Si Satchanalai, with separate zones for religious sites both within and outside of town limits. Structures are usually large and made of laterite. Religious sites on the west bank of the Ping River at Nakhon Chum are built of bricks and of smaller size. City walls and old fortifications mark the boundary of the rectangular town area, measuring 300‚Äì700 metres wide and 2,200 metres long.  Sights  Wat Phra Kaeo (‡∏ß‡∏±‡∏î‡∏û‡∏£‡∏∞‡πÅ‡∏Å‡πâ‡∏ß) is a large royal temple in town centre near a site believed to have been a palace. The temple itself was used on important city events and had no monks in residence. Major features include the principal chedi with lion-adorned base and a round chedi with elephant-adorned base. There are also other Chedis of different bases and remains of several chapels. Its boundary is marked off by laterite walls. Second in size to Wat Phra Kaeo is Wat Phra That (‡∏ß‡∏±‡∏î‡∏û‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏ò‡∏≤‡∏ï‡∏∏). Here the principal Chedi is built of mixture of laterite and bricks with a 15-metre wide square base. The style is of Kamphaeng Phet architecture. Sa Mon (‡∏™‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏°‡∏ô) is the site of the palace to the north of Wat Phra Kaeo with a square earthen wall almost touching the northern city wall. Surrounding the walls on three sides are moats with a pond in the middle. There are no standing structures remaining today. Wat Phra Non (‡∏ß‡∏±‡∏î‡∏û‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏ô‡∏≠‡∏ô) is enclosed by laterite walls on four sides. At the front of the temple are a square-shaped pond, restrooms, and an ancient floating pavilion which is supported by a large laterite column. The entire column was cut out in one single piece from its source and measures 1.1 m on each side and 6.4 m in height, the largest such stone in the country. A lion sculpture and Sema stones (boundary stones) can still be discerned. The large vihan which once housed the reclining Buddha has crumbled entirely. Wat Phra Si Iriyabot (‡∏ß‡∏±‡∏î‡∏û‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏™‡∏µ‡πà‡∏≠‡∏¥‡∏£‡∏¥‡∏¢‡∏≤‡∏ö‡∏ñ) is located to the north of Wat Phra Non and have similar pond and bathroom facilities as its neighbour. Walls on the four sides are of laterite materials with an entrance also made of laterite. A mondop structure houses Buddha statues in four postures- walking, sitting, standing and reclining in the Sukhothai artistic style. Today only the statue in the standing posture still remains. Wat Phra Sing (‡∏ß‡∏±‡∏î‡∏û‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏™‡∏¥‡∏á‡∏´‡πå) is believed to have been constructed during both the Sukhothai and Ayutthaya periods. With laterite walls, it has a square-shaped principal chedi with arches on four sides. In front of the ubosot are ornamental lion and Naga figurines. Wat Chang Rop (also \\"Rob\\") (‡∏ß‡∏±‡∏î‡∏ä‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏á‡∏£‡∏≠‡∏ö) is a large temple situated on a high hill. Its main chedi of Ceylonese style is in the middle of the yard but its top part is broken down. The base is adorned with 68 half- elephants between which are Bhoti-shaped designs. There are also traces of demon and female dancers‚Äô figures remaining.

A unitary authority (with the combined powers of a district and regional council), it is also known as the Gisborne Region. It is named after its largest settlement, the city of Gisborne. The region is also commonly referred to as the East Coast. The region is commonly divided into the East Cape and Poverty Bay. It is bounded by mountain ranges to the west, rugged country to the south, and faces east onto the Pacific Ocean. Name and history Prior to the late 19th century, the area was known as T≈´ranga. However, as the Gisborne town site was laid out in 1870, the name changed to Gisborne, after the Colonial Secretary William Gisborne, and to avoid confusion with the town of Tauranga. The region was formerly known as the East Coast, although the region is often divided into the East Coast proper (or East Cape), north of the city, and Poverty Bay, the area including and surrounding the city. The region is also sometimes referred to as the East Cape, although that also refers specifically to the promontory at the northeastern extremity. More recently, it has been called Eastland, although that can also include ≈åp≈çtiki in the eastern Bay of Plenty to the northwest, and Wairoa to the south. Its MƒÅori name Te Tai RƒÅwhiti means the Coast of the Sunrise, reflecting the fact that it is the first part of the New Zealand mainland to see the sun rise. Gisborne District Council styles the name as Te TairƒÅwhiti. Geography The region is located in the northeastern corner of the North Island. It ranges from the Wharerata Hills in the south, which divide it from the Wairoa district in the Hawke's Bay region, to Lottin Point in the north. The western boundary runs along the Raukumara Range, which separates it from the Opotiki district. In the southwest, its boundary runs along the western edge of Te Urewera National Park. It is sparsely inhabited and isolated, with small settlements mainly clinging to small bays along the eastern shore including Tokomaru Bay and Tolaga Bay. Its population is Three- quarters of the population ‚Äì ‚Äì lives in the city of Gisborne. No other settlement has a population of over 1000. The largest other settlements are the towns of Tolaga Bay and Ruatoria, each with populations of over 800 in 2001. Inland, the land is rough, predominantly forested, hill country. A spine of rough ridges dominates the centre of the region, culminating in the impressive bulk of the 1752 metre Mount Hikurangi Te Ara ki Hikurangi in Waiapu Valley in the region's northeast. This mountain is the fifth highest mountain in the North Island, and the highest that is not a volcano. Regarded as sacred by MƒÅori, there is some justification to the claims that this is the first mountain to see the sun in summer. The region's population has higher than the national average proportion of MƒÅori - over 50% in some areas - and maintains strong ties to both MƒÅori tradition and the iwi and marae structure. The predominant iwi are NgƒÅti Porou, Rongowhakaata, Ngai Tamanuhiri, Te Aitanga a Mahaki. Government Gisborne District Council is a unitary territorial authority, which means that it performs the functions of a regional council as well as those of a territorial authority (a district or city). It includes a mayor, 13 elected councillors, an appointed chief executive officer, 4 department managers and approximately 250 staff. The district council and main administration centre is located in Fitzherbert Street, in the city of Gisborne. The area it governs is constituted as both the Gisborne District and the Gisborne Region. Gisborne District Council was created as part of a major nationwide reform of local government in 1989. It replaced the councils of Gisborne City, Cook County, Waiapu County and Waikohu County, East Cape United Council, East Cape Catchment Board and Regional Water Board, East Coast Pest Destruction Board, two harbour boards, and several noxious plants authorities and recreation reserve boards. It was the only unitary authority in New Zealand until three others were created in 1992. Economy The subnational gross domestic product (GDP) of the Gisborne region was estimated at NZ$2.16 billion in the year to March 2019, 0.7% of New Zealand's national GDP. The regional GDP per capita was estimated at $44,004 in the same period. Climate The region is sheltered by high country to the west and has a dry, sunny climate. It has a yearly average of 2,200 sunshine hours. The annual rainfall varies from about 1000mm near the coast to over 2500mm in higher inland country. Typical maxima range from 20-28 ¬∞C in summer and 10-16 ¬∞C in winter. Minima vary from 10-16 ¬∞C in summer to 0-8 ¬∞C in winter.

Headquartered in New York, it is published by certain member firms of the PricewaterhouseCoopers network. Prior to the separation of Booz & Company (now Strategy&) from Booz Allen Hamilton in 2008, strategy+business was published by Booz Allen Hamilton, which launched the magazine, then titled Strategy & Business, in 1995. Full issues of strategy+business appear in print and digital edition form on a quarterly basis, and other original material is published daily on its website. Articles cover a range of industry and organizational topics that are of interest to CEOs and other senior executives as well as to business thinkers, academics, and researchers. The articles, written in English, are authored by a mix of leading figures from both the executive suite and academia in addition to journalists and consultants from PwC. The magazine's founding editor-in-chief, Joel Kurtzman, coined the term thought leadership when he published interviews with influential business figures under the rubric ‚ÄúThought Leaders.‚Äù Today, interviews with ‚ÄúThought Leaders‚Äù remain a recurring column in the print magazine and on the website. History The late Joel Kurtzman, formerly editor-in-chief of the Harvard Business Review and a business editor and columnist at the New York Times‚Äîtogether with a group of partners at Booz & Company, then part of Booz Allen Hamilton‚Äîfounded strategy+business in 1995. A collection of Kurtzman's Thought Leader columns was published in book form, Thought Leaders: Insights on the Future of Business (Jossey-Bass, 1997). Kurtzman served as editor-in-chief between 1995 and 1999. Randall Rothenberg succeeded Kurtzman, serving as editor-in-chief between 2000 and 2005. Previously, Rothenberg had been an editor of the New York Times Magazine and had also served as the newspaper's advertising columnist. He redesigned strategy+business, introduced the ‚ÄúBest Business Books‚Äù feature, and expanded coverage of the burgeoning electronic media infrastructure. Rothenberg's first major issue, which was published in February 2000, was titled ‚ÄúE-Business: Lessons from Planet Earth,‚Äù and it contained articles that prophesied the dot- com crash that occurred several months later. During Rothenberg's tenure, the strategy+business staff was formally brought into the Booz Allen Hamilton operation; prior to that, the magazine was a standalone, contracted enterprise. By 2002, the firm's e-commerce businesses had hit serious headwinds, and the future of strategy+business was not certain. But Booz Allen's partners decided to keep publishing it. Rothenberg began developing what he and Cesare Mainardi (then an influential partner in North America's commercial practice and a former chief executive officer at Strategy&) called the ‚Äúfunctional agenda.‚Äù They started to build a body of research and practice around six major functions: strategy and leadership; innovation; organizations and people; marketing and sales; mergers and restructuring; and operations. Many of the regular, annual features in strategy+business‚Äîincluding the ‚ÄúGlobal Innovation 1000‚Äù survey of top R&D; spenders and the ‚ÄúCEO Succession‚Äù report on CEO tenure‚Äîdate back to this effort. Art Kleiner succeeded Rothenberg in 2005 and served as editor-in-chief until January 2020. A writer, lecturer, and commentator, Kleiner is the author of The Age of Heretics: A History of the Radical Thinkers Who Reinvented Corporate Management (Currency/Doubleday, 1996; rev‚Äôd. ed., 2008, Jossey-Bass) and Who Really Matters: The Core Group Theory of Power, Privilege, and Success (Currency/Doubleday, 2003). During Kleiner's tenure, the magazine has published influential articles on such topics as neuroscience and leadership (a 2006 article by David Rock and Jeffrey Schwartz led to the establishment of the field of neuroleadership), women in emerging markets (‚ÄúThe Third Billion‚Äù), capabilities-driven strategy, investment in infrastructure, organizational culture, long-wave theories of economic change, and market dislocation.http://www.strategy-business.com/feature/Diagnosing- Dislocation?gko=b4bb5 In 2020, financial and economic journalist Daniel Gross was named editor-in-chief. After a private equity takeover by the Carlyle Group in 2008, Booz Allen Hamilton was split into two entities. At that time, strategy+business became the flagship publication of the global commercial firm, Booz & Company (now known as Strategy&).

It debuted at number one on the New York Times Best Seller list for hardcover fiction. Plot summary Nearly a year and a half after the events in Small Favor, a wounded Warden Morgan shows up at Dresden's apartment, asking for protection from the other Wardens. Morgan reveals that he was drugged and framed for the murder of Senior Council member LaFortier. While obtaining medical supplies, Dresden spots a naagloshi, a shape-shifting creature from Native American lore. Over the course of investigating Morgan's apparent crime, he legally entangles his apprentice Molly, as well as Captain Luccio, after they stumble over Morgan in Dresden's home. Dresden also confronts Madeline Raith of the White Court, whom Dresden comes to suspect is behind framing Morgan, and Binder, a practitioner who uses beings of the Nevernever as a mercenary. Dresden invites Captain Luccio to accompany him on a visit to Lara Raith and accuses her of complicity, but is interrupted by the naagloshi who ransoms Thomas Raith for Morgan. Realizing he needs far more strength to combat the naagloshi, Dresden performs a Sanctum Invocation and bonds with the spirit of Demonreach, the island in the finale of Small Favor. Despite this, Dresden‚Äîaware that he can't fight both the naagloshi and Morgan's betrayer alone‚Äîcalls the Council, House Raith, and the naagloshii, convincing each that Morgan is on the island or that the island is where they will meet to discuss further strategy. Dresden manages to take down Madeline and Binder, but it takes the intervention of Listens-to-Wind to defeat the naagloshi. Thomas is rescued but is insane with hunger, and is collected by Lara. Morgan surrenders after the true murderer manages to slip away. Back in Scotland for Morgan's trial, Dresden produces incontrovertible evidence that a high ranking clerk, Peabody, is the murderer, and has also been influencing virtually everyone on the Council by use of magically poisoned ink. Peabody escapes, slaughtering a large portion of the Council, and opens a Way into the Nevernever. Dresden chases Peabody down, but is overpowered. Morgan kills Peabody, but is mortally wounded. Morgan then explains that it was Anastasia Luccio who actually killed LaFortier, under the influence of Peabody, and Morgan acted to protect her. Morgan then passes away. In the aftermath, Gregori Cristos (suspected by Dresden of being on the Black Council) fills LaFortier's Senior Council seat. During a respite, Luccio approaches Dresden, and confirms that her romantic feelings for Dresden were most likely manufactured by Peabody's subtle influences (as Rashid the Gatekeeper had suggested to Dresden while he was recovering in the Council Infirmary), and formally ends the relationship. Dresden learns that Ebenezar is slowly and quietly drumming up support from those who secretly believe that a Black Council exists, and that it must be opposed. Dresden labels the new group Ebenezar is forming as the \\"Grey Council\\". Introduced characters * Skinwalker: A Naagloshii, a Native American spirit of immense power and ability to change form. This creature has survived a millennium and is semi- divine in nature. It eats magical creatures, including wizards, to increase its own power. * Vincent Graver: A private detective and former vice officer from Joliet, who resigned after being assigned to the SIU as punishment for trying to prosecute a Chicago city council member. Dresden is impressed with his integrity, and subcontracts detective work to him.

She betrayed the White Court to the Black Council in much the same way as Vitto Malvora did in White Night. Working with Lara's business manager, she creates a money trail from Morgan to one of Lara's holding companies, in order to implicate the White Court in LaFortier's death. She hires Binder to find Morgan before anyone else does, so that Morgan can be blamed for her future activities. Lara ultimately kills both Madeline and the business manager and sends their heads to the White Council. References External links *The first five chapters of the book are found on the author's .

These measures provoked the anger of the nobility, who threw their support behind the Qara'unas Amir Qazaghan.

They primarily live in northern states of India, Nepal and Sindh province of Pakistan. Etymology The term Sunar may derive from the Sanskrit suvarna kƒÅr, \\"worker in gold\\". History A Sunar working in pre independence India. The Sunar are traditional goldsmiths and silversmiths in India. They also used to practice siddhar medicine and are agriculturists. According to popular myth, in the Vishwakarma Purana (compiled after 18th century), the Sunar are said to be the descendants of Suparna, who was one of the five sons created by Hindu god, Vishnwakarman Sunars since 18th century stood for social uplifting and demanded Brahmin status claiming to be descendants of Vishwakarma and in some other regions, e.g - North most of them claimed being from Kshatriya and even Vaishya varna. In 1931 census of India, many Sunars mentioned their caste as Vishwakarma or Panchal and became successful in some regions. There is however a steady process in taking up other occupations, and the community in Haryana and Punjab as whole is fairly successful, having produced several professionals.People of India: Haryana (Volume XXIII) edited by M.L Sharma and A.K Bhatia pages 475 to 479 Manohar Books Social Status Sunar is one of the hereditary village servicing castes so they falls under lower hierarchy in social rank but are pure or touchable communities. Brahmins can accept foods offered by them and gives them service. Ahir Sunars or Kshatriya Ahir Sonars in the Khandesh region (known for large population of Ahirs) occupy a high social status in the Maharashtra. Today, condition of Sunars living in urban regions are somewhat good but those living in rural regions are in poverty. Goldsmithing is considered as not much impure job so main problem is other communities holding major share of jewellery business limiting most Sunars only as a jewellery maker or working class than trader or owner of showrooms. Still significant people among them holds this business on large scale. Being among the economically and politically disadvantaged communities, Sunars are included under Other Backward Class list. In Nepal, Sunars poor falls under groups untouchable and clubbed as Kami. Sunars in Nepal falls under 'Hill Dalits' communities and have benefits of reservation. Reservation policy helped many Sunars after the passing of the Mandal Commission and the community showed a tremendous increase in its literacy rate making one of the most literate castes of India. Divisions Sunars are divided into a large number of territorial and non-territorial groupings called alla. Some of the major alla are the Santanpuriya, Kannaujiya, Mahawar, Shahpuriya, Bundelkhandi, Ayodhyawasi, and Shahabadi. The Sunar have surnames, e.g - Soni, Seth, Swarnkar, Sah, Shah, Bhutani, Sonik, Mehra, Verma, Gupta,etc as their surnames. Zargar, also known as Muslim Sunars, they are primarily found in Pakistan and Jammu & Kashmir state of India and Sarraf are also sections of Sunars who are mainly involved in pawnbroking or money-lending (though not all Sarrafs are Sunar). In Gujarat and Rajasthan, the community is also known as Soni.People of India: Uttar Pradesh (Volume XLII) edited by A Hasan & J C Das page 1500 In Maharashtra, the community is known as Sonar or Swarnkar. In Punjab and Haryana, they are divided into three groups Sunars (who often use surnames as Bhutani, Suri, Soni, Verma, etc) (though Khatri Sunars and Mair Rajput are separate caste).People of India: Haryana (Volume XXIII) edited by M.L Sharma and A.K Bhatia page 475 Manohar Books They are also called SunnƒÅri in Odisha, SonagƒÅra in South Canara regions and Panchal or Vishwakarma in South India.

Mortimer's affair with Queen Isabella  Joan's husband Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March, is allegedly depicted in the foreground with Queen Isabella in this 14th-century manuscript illustration Mortimer was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Ireland on 23 November 1316 and left for Ireland with a large force in February 1317.Cawley, Charles (2010). Medieval Lands, English earls 1207-1466 While there, he fought against the Scots Army led by Edward Bruce, the younger brother of Robert the Bruce (who hoped to make Edward king of Ireland), and Bruce's Norman-Irish allies, the de Lacy's. Joan accompanied her husband to Ireland. They returned to England in 1318 after Mortimer had driven the Scots north to Carrickfergus, and dispersed the de Lacys, who were Joan's relatives. For the next few years, Mortimer occupied himself with baronial disputes on the Welsh border; nevertheless, on account of the increasing influence of Hugh Despenser, the Elder, and Hugh Despenser the Younger over King Edward II, Roger Mortimer became strongly disaffected with his monarch, especially after the younger Despenser had been granted lands which rightfully belonged to Mortimer.Costain, p.197 In October 1321 King Edward and his troops besieged Leeds Castle, after the governor's wife, Margaret de Clare, Baroness Badlesmere, refused Queen Isabella admittance and subsequently ordered her archers to fire upon Isabella and her escort after the latter attempted to gain entry to the castle. Elizabeth, the third Badlesmere daughter, was married to Joan and Mortimer's eldest son, Edmund. King Edward exploited his new popularity in the wake of his military victory at Leeds to recall to England the Despensers, whom the Lords Ordainers, led by Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster, had forced him to banish in August 1321.Costain, p.195 The Marcher lords, already in a state of insurrection for some time prior to the Despensers' banishment,Commencing in February 1321, Mortimer and the other Marcher Lords had conducted devastating attacks against Despenser lands in Wales; Mortimer and his men had also made an attempt to march on London. These events, among others, had made it imperative for the Ordainers to compel the King to banish the favourites. immediately rose up against the King in full force, with Mortimer leading the confederation alongside Ordainer Humphrey de Bohun, 4th Earl of Hereford.Costain, pp.196-97 The King quelled the rebellion, which is also known as the Despenser War; Mortimer and his uncle Roger Mortimer de Chirk both surrendered to him at Shrewsbury on 22 January 1322. Mortimer and his uncle were dispatched as prisoners to the Tower of London, where they were kept in damp, unhealthy quarters. This was likely a factor in Roger Mortimer de Chirk's death in 1326. Joan's husband had fared better; by drugging the constable and the Tower guards, he managed to escape to France on 1 August 1323.Costain, pp.207-08 It was there that he later became the lover of Queen Isabella, who was estranged from the King as a result of the Despensers' absolute control over him. She had been sent to France on a peace mission by Edward but used the occasion to seek help from her brother, Charles IV to oust the Despensers.Costain, pp.209-212 The scandal of their love affair forced them to leave the French court for Flanders, where they obtained help for an invasion of England.Costain, pp.213-16 Joan's imprisonment Skipton Castle, Yorkshire, where Joan was imprisoned from 1324 to 1326 While the couple were still in France, King Edward had retaliated against Mortimer by taking Joan and all of their children into custody, and \\"treating them with severity\\".Costain, p.212 In April 1324 Joan was removed from Hampshire where she had been confined in a lodging under house arrest and sent to Skipton Castle in Yorkshire; there she was imprisoned in a cell and endured considerable suffering and hardship.Mortimer, Ian (2003).

On 16 November, King Edward was taken prisoner and eventually murdered at Berkeley Castle, presumably by Mortimer's hired assassins.Costain, pp.236-7. From 1327 to 1330, Mortimer and Isabella jointly held the Office of Regent for her son, King Edward III who was duly crowned following his father's death. Mortimer was made constable of Wallingford Castle; in September 1328, Mortimer was created Earl of March. This made Joan henceforth, the Countess of March; although it is not known what she thought about her husband's illegal assumption of power and flagrant affair with the Queen. What has been established is that Joan was never an active participant in her husband's insurrection against King Edward.Seabourne, p.65 Mortimer and Queen Isabella were the de facto rulers of England. Hostility against the power Mortimer wielded over the kingdom and the young King Edward III, increased; his former friend Henry of Lancaster encouraged the King to assert his authority to oust Mortimer. When Mortimer ordered the execution of Edmund, Earl of Kent, half-brother of the late King Edward, anger and outrage engulfed the country. The King deposed his mother and her lover; Roger Mortimer was seized, arrested, and on 29 November 1330, hanged at Tyburn, London.Costain, pp.274-75 Following her husband's execution, Joan ‚Äì as the wife of a traitor ‚Äì was imprisoned again, this time in Hampshire where years before she had been placed under house arrest; her children were also taken into custody.

Biography Harrison received his doctorate in Romance Studies from Cornell University in 1984. In 1985, he accepted a visiting assistant professorship in the Department of French and Italian at Stanford. In 1986, he joined the faculty as an assistant professor. He was granted tenure in 1992, and was promoted to full professor in 1995. In 1997, Stanford offered him the Rosina Pierotti Chair. In 2002, he was named chair of the Department of French and Italian, which he continued to be until 2010. As of September 2014, he is once again Chair of the department.https://dlcl.stanford.edu/departments/french-and- italian/contact He began his academic career as a Dante scholar, publishing The Body of Beatrice in 1988. His work quickly expanded to concern itself broadly with the Western literary and philosophical tradition, focusing on the human place in nature and what he calls \\"the humic foundations\\" of human culture. In 1992 he published Forests: The Shadow of Civilization, a wide- ranging history of the religious, mythological, literary, and philosophical role of forests in the Western imagination. In 2003 he published The Dominion of the Dead, in which he probes the relations the living have maintained with the dead in a number of secular domains, among them burial places, houses, testaments, images, dreams, and political institutions. In his book Gardens: An Essay on the Human Condition (2008), Harrison focused on the role that care and cultivation play in human culture, arguing that gardens embody \\"the vocation of care\\" that defines the inner core of our humanity. Like his earlier books, Gardens offers a philosophically based vision of humanity's relation to the natural world that is founded on mortality and finitude. His books have been translated into Chinese, French, German, Japanese, Korean, and Italian. Most recently, Harrison is the author of a forthcoming book, Juvenescence: A Cultural History of Our Age, slated to appear with the University of Chicago Press in December 2014.http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/J/bo18596462.html In addition to his academic books, he has also written many articles, chapters, and essays, including ones on figures such as Dante, Vico, and Nietzsche, as well as philosophical problems related to architecture, modernity, poetry, and nature. His own philosophical orientation reflects an enduring commitment to the phenomenological tradition. He also contributed several essays to the New York Review of Books, to which he has been a regular contributor since 2009. He has written essays on John Muir, Theodore Roosevelt, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Giacomo Leopardi, Dante Alighieri, Harold Bloom, the King James Bible, America's natural history, and Margaret Fuller. He also recently contributed a critique of Silicon Valley culture to the New York Review of Books online blog.http://www.nybooks.com/blogs/nyrblog/2014/jul/17/children-silicon-valley/ He has also contributed to the Financial Times, reviewing an English-language translation of Giacomo Leopardi's Zibaldone.http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/ae962862-03fc-11e3-8aab-00144feab7de.html#axzz3HInxG94z In addition to his writing, he played lead guitar for the cerebral rock band Glass Wave, with whom he recorded an album in 2010. He is also host of the radio program Entitled Opinions on Stanford's station KZSU 90.1. Entitled Opinions features hour-long conversations on topics of intellectual interest, including but not limited to history, literature, music, philosophy, and science. Most of his guests have been Stanford-affiliated thinkers, including Ren√© Girard, Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht, Marjorie Perloff, Richard Rorty, and Michel Serres, but have sometimes been outside guests, such as Vinton Cerf, Shirley Hazzard, Orhan Pamuk, and Colm Toibin. He has also interviewed a number of prominent scientists, including Andrei Linde, Paul Ehrlich, and Michael Hendrickson. Since 2005, Harrison has recorded over 150 episodes of Entitled Opinions (On Life and Literature). Episodes are available on the show's website as well as through iTunes as a podcast. He has been a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences since 2007. In October 2014, he was decorated with the title of Chevalier of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French government.http://highereducation.frenchculture.org/news/robert- pogue-harrison-decorated-consul-general-france-san-francisco Bibliography Books *The Body of Beatrice (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1988) *Forests: The Shadow of Civilization (University of Chicago Press, 1992) *Rome, la Pluie: A Quoi Bon Litt√©rature?

Contrary to secular equilibrium, the half-life of the daughter is not negligible compared to parent's half-life. An example of this is a molybdenum-99 generator producing technetium-99 for nuclear medicine diagnostic procedures. Such a generator is sometimes called a cow because the daughter product, in this case technetium-99, is milked at regular intervals.transient equilibrium Transient equilibrium occurs after four half-lives, on average. Activity in transient equilibrium The activity of the daughter is given by the Bateman equation: :A_d = A_P(0)\\\\frac{\\\\lambda_d}{\\\\lambda_d-\\\\lambda_P} \\\\times (e^{-\\\\lambda_Pt}-e^{-\\\\lambda_dt}) \\\\times BR + A_d(0)e^{-\\\\lambda_dt}, where A_P and A_d are the activity of the parent and daughter, respectively. T_P and T_d are the half-lives (inverses of reaction rates \\\\lambda in the above equation modulo ln(2)) of the parent and daughter, respectively, and BR is the branching ratio. In transient equilibrium, the Bateman equation cannot be simplified by assuming the daughter's half-life is negligible compared to the parent's half-life. The ratio of daughter-to-parent activity is given by: :\\\\frac{A_d}{A_P} = \\\\frac{T_P}{T_P-T_d} \\\\times BR. Time of maximum daughter activity In transient equilibrium, the daughter activity increases and eventually reaches a maximum value that can exceed the parent activity. The time of maximum activity is given by: :t_{\\\\max} = \\\\frac{1.44 \\\\times T_P T_d}{T_P-T_d} \\\\times \\\\ln\\\\frac{T_P}{T_d}, where T_P and T_d are the half-lives of the parent and daughter, respectively.

Etymology Sutil Channel was named around 1864 by Captain George Henry Richards in honor of the ship Sutil used by Dionisio Alcal√° Galiano in exploring the region in 1792. A group of small islands in Sutil Channel called the Subtle Islands are named for Galiano's ship as well, translated to English. Geography Extent Sutil Channel is located between Cortes Island to the east, and Quadra Island and Read Island to the west. It connects Calm Channel to the north with the Strait of Georgia to the south. Hoskyn Channel branches off toward the northwest from the Sutil Channel between Read Island and Quadra Island. Van Densp Inlet branches off from the northern end of the channel to incise Cortes Island from the northwest. The southern boundary of Sutil Channel, where it joins the Strait of Georgia, is defined as a line between Francisco Point, at the southeast end of Quadra Island, to Sutil Point, the southern end of Cortes Island. Sometimes Cape Mudge instead of Francisco Point is mentioned as the southern end of Quadra Island. The boundary between Sutil Channel and Hoskyn Channel is a line between Rebecca Spit on Quadra Island and Read Point on Read Island. Wide in the south, Sutil Channel narrows in the north, and merges with Calm Channel at the northernmost point of Cortes Island in the vicinity of the Rendezvous Islands. Settlements on the shore of Sutil Channel include Whaletown on Cortes Island.Geography from Base Map Online Store , TRIM 1:20,000 Digital Base Maps, British Columbia Integrated Land Management Bureau, Base Mapping and Geomatic Services; and Desolation Sound, which strictly defined does not directly connect to Sutil Channel, is sometimes used loosely as all the waters north of Cape Mudge and Sarah Point, including Sutil Channel and Discovery Passage.

The site contains a small fortified area of approximately 50x50 m with living quarters and manufacturing sites both inside and outside this area. Historical significance The site is believed to date from 2500-2000 BC. There has been excavation in this place from 1996 onward was undertaken by The Maharaja Sayyajirao University, Baroda and a unique Harappan seal, which is hollow inside and first of its kind, was found here. The excavation of this site has revealed evidence of manufacture and trade and highlighted importance of such smaller Harappan sites, in the economic development of Indus Valley Civilization. Artifacts found Craft items of shell, semi-precious stone, stone beads, faience and copper, unique unicorn seal with hollow place looking some sort of container inside, other harappan seals (total six), copper knives with bone handles, copper artifacts, etc. Copper objects Being a small size settlement, the number of copper objects found at Gola Dhoro is very high. A copper vessel containing eight bangles, an axe probably used for recycling precious metal, copper knives with bone handles are found. A unique copper battle-axe (parashu) is also an interesting find from this area and the small size of the battle-axe suggests it as presumably used for ritualistic purpose. The unique copper knives were found in association with large amount of fish bones, suggesting that the knives were used for drying of fish. However, no evidence of copper smelting has been found, but heavily tampered clay crucibles with copper adhering in them have been found, suggesting that they might have been used for copper smelting. Harappan seals Considering its relatively small size of less than 2 hectares, Archaeologists did not expect much from Gola Dhoro, but they were surprised to find five inscribed steatite seal with unicorn depicted on it. These type of seals are fairly common in urban centers of Indus Valley civilization, which would have been used in trade related activities. In addition to engraved inscription and unicorn picture, one of the seals has a deep scooped out rectangular socket like cavity, the purpose of which is not clear. Such seal with socket is unique find and not reported in any other Harappan site. Importance Although this settlement was small in area, with 1.92 hectares, it had a wall measuring 5.20m in width built in three successive stages and there was flourishing craft and trading activities. Gola Dhoro specialised in production of shell bangles and semi precious stone beads as well as objects of copper and faience. Bead manufacturing was undertaken mainly outside the walled area of the town and objects of faience were manufactured only within the walled area. This unwalled town with a walled citadel, seems to have been a centre for trade and industry. Large blackware storage jars suggest the settlement engaged in overseas trade, since such vessels were used for transporting goods to Magan (present day Oman).

He returned to China at a time when the American influence was zesty and self- confident, and his very name at that time (zhixing) meant \\"knowledge-action,\\" reflecting the catch-phrase of the Neo-Confucian philosopher Wang Yangming which implied that once knowledge (zhi) had been obtained, then action (xing) would be easy.\\"T'ao Hsing-chih,\\" in Howard Boorman, ed.

Through the society the educationists promoted the forming of modern education system in China. In August 1923, Tao and Y.C. James Yen organized the National Association of Mass Education Movements (MEM). At the height of its literacy campaign in the 1920s, Yen estimated that the MEM had taught five million students with more than 100,000 volunteer teachers. Tao went on to become the nation's leading promoter of rural teacher's education.

The school is a recognized Christian minority private institution run by the Missionaries of St. Francis de Saleshttp://sfsdelhi.com/management/management.html and affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education. History The school was established on 9 April 1978 by Father Thomas Thoomkuzy. The foundation stone for the building was laid on 9 July 1977 by Shri Sikandar Bhakt, the Union Minister for Works and Housing. The foundation stone was blessed by his Excellency Rt. Rev. Dr. Luciano Storero, the Apostolic nuncio to India. This is the first school in Delhi that has implemented the technology of closed circuit television in its classrooms, named \\"Vidya Darpan\\". The school started with 117 students and had a humble beginning in tents. The high school (grades 9-10) began in the 1982-83 school year, and the first batch of 61 students appeared for their 10th class Board exams in 1983‚Äì84. The school was upgraded to Senior Secondary (grades 11-12) the same year. In April 1982, the foundation of the Hindi medium section (extended section) aimed at providing formal academic education in the afternoon to children from the weak and underprivileged segments of society was started with a batch of 50 students belonging to classes from kindergarten through second grade. In 1993, the extended section was upgraded to class 10 and in 1995 the first batch of students appeared for their CBSE examinations. In 2002, the School celebrated its silver jubilee after completing 25 years. The school has been consistently ranked among the top schools in West Delhi. Academic Curriculum and Educational Policy The school is affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education and its students appear for the AISSE (Class 10 CBSE Board), AISSCE (Class 12 CBSE Board) exams respectively. The school follows the CBSE curriculum with text-books and study material approved by the board.

It is centered on a large bowl naturally carved in a rock headland which is partially open to the Pacific Ocean. Waves enter the bowl and often violently churn, swirl, and foam. Outside the bowl, ocean conditions are attractive to surfers near a large offshore rock pinnacle named Gull Rock, located about west-northwest of Devils Punch Bowl, which funnels and concentrates waves easily seen from the park. There are at least seventeen large rocks, part of Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge, which provide interesting wave viewing, and attract and provide a home for wildlife. Devils Punch Bowl is located about south of Depoe Bay, and about north of Newport in the community of Otter Rock, and about west of U.S. Route 101. The park encompasses , which includes picnic grounds. There is a trail for access to the beach, and tide pools. The bowl is thought to have been created when two caves carved by the ocean collapsed. Whales migrate past the park, in season, and the park, which projects into the Pacific, provides panoramic views of the ocean and good whale watching. Inside the bowl looking out shows how separate sea caves merged to form a larger chamber  History  At one time the Punch Bowl was referred to as \\"Satan's Cauldron\\". The park was acquired in at least three parcels between 1929 and 1952.

The debate rages on as to whether it is moral, ethical and legal for employers to monitor the actions of their employees. Employers believe that monitoring is necessary both to discourage illicit activity and to limit liability. With this problem of monitoring employees, many are experiencing a negative effect on emotional and physical stress including fatigue, lowered employee morale and lack of motivation within the workplace. Employers might choose to monitor employee activities using surveillance cameras, or may wish to record employees activities while using company-owned computers or telephones. Courts are finding that disputes between workplace privacy and freedom are being complicated with the advancement of technology as traditional rules that govern areas of privacy law are debatable and becoming less important.Howstuffworks \\"How Workplace Surveillance Works\\"Electronic surveillance in the workplace Europe The EU Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of individuals with regards to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data limits and regulates the collection of personal information on individuals, including workers. Firms that monitor employees' use of e-mail, internet, or phones as part of their business practice without notifying employees or obtaining employee consent can be, in most cases, sued under Article 8 the European Convention on Human Rights. Although EU law is clear that e-mail interception is illegal, the law is not totally clear as to whether companies may prohibit employees from sending private e-mails.Sylvia Mercado Kierkegaard (2005) Reading Your Keystroke: Whose Mail Is It? Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Publisher: Springer Berlin / Heidelberg, Volume 3592 / 2005, Chapter: p. 256 United States The Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 provides some privacy protections for employees. See Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 ¬ß Employee Privacy. The Electronic Communications Privacy Act extends protections to include email messages, cell phones and other electronic communications. See Electronic Communications Privacy Act ¬ß Employee Privacy. A 2005 survey of more than 500 U.S. companies found that over half of employers had disciplined employees and about one in four had terminated (fired) an employee for \\"inappropriate\\" use of the internet, such as sending an inappropriate email message to a client or supervisor, neglecting work while chatting with friends, or viewing pornography during work hours.Surfing the Web on the Company Dime : NPR The tools that are used for electronic surveillance are often caching proxy servers that are also used for web monitoring. Canada In R v Cole, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that  Economic theory  According to the Coase Theorem, an employer and an employee never agree to a contractual arrangement that would reduce the total surplus generated by the two parties together. Hence, when we observe workplace surveillance, then the costs (say, the worker's disutility caused by the loss of privacy) must be smaller than the benefit (say, the additional profit due to a reduction of shirking), because otherwise the parties would abolish surveillance (the worker would be willing to accept a smaller wage in exchange for more privacy, which would increase the employer's profit more than surveillance could do). However, the Coase Theorem holds only if there are no transaction costs. Schmitz (2005) has shown that in the presence of asymmetric information (leading to a moral hazard problem), the total surplus generated by an employer and an employee can be increased if workplace surveillance is prohibited by law.

In the incantation, Sinthgunt is referred to as the sister of the personified sun, Sunna (whose name is alliterative to Sinthgunt),Orchard (1997:112). and the two sisters are cited as both producing charms to heal Phol's horse, a figure also otherwise unattested. The two are then followed by Friia and Uolla, also alliterative and stated as sisters. As Sinthgunt is otherwise unattested, her significance is otherwise unknown, but some scholarly theories exist about her role in Germanic mythology based on proposed etymologies, and the potential significance of her placement within the incantation. Etymology The etymology of Sinthgunt is unclear. Within the original manuscript, Sinthgunt is spelled Sinhtgunt (emphasis added). In the 19th century, Sophus Bugge stuck strictly to this reading, proposing a complex compound based on Germanic *Sin- naœát-gund, i.e. \\"the night-walking one\\".Sophus Bugge: Studien √ºber die Entstehung der nordischen G√∂tter- und Heldensagen. M√ºnchen 1889, p. 298. Cf. Rudolf Simek: Lexikon der germanischen Mythologie, p. 374. As a result of the pairing with Sunna, the personified sun, this etymology has been interpreted as a reference to the moon. However, this reading has yielded problems; the moon in Germanic mythology is considered masculine, exemplified in the personification of the moon in Norse mythology, M√°ni, a male figure. According to Simek, the historical record lacks evidence for any cult of personified celestial bodies among the ancient Germanic peoples.Rudolf Simek: Lexikon der germanischen Mythologie, pp. 392, 397. Schaffner rejects this etymology, as does Eichner, because the first element Sinht- cannot be based on the presupposed earlier Germanic *sinœát-. Such a Germanic form would have yielded Old High German *sƒ´ht by regular sound change.Stefan Schaffner: Die G√∂tternamen des Zweiten Merseburger Zauberspruchs, p. 169. The amended Sinthgunt presupposes a Proto-Germanic compound *Sen√æa-gun√æj≈ç, the first element meaning \\"raid, (military) campaign\\", the second one \\"fight\\". This interpretation fits nicely with other Old High German female names such as Sindhilt (from *Sen√æa-œáil√∞ij≈ç, with its second element also meaning \\"fight\\", cf. Old Norse hil√∞r, Old English hild).Stefan Schaffner: Die G√∂tternamen des Zweiten Merseburger Zauberspruchs, p. 169 f. Furthermore, Simek also mentions the interpretation \\"heavenly body, star\\".Simek (2007:285-286). Placement The figures Fulla (Uolla) and Frigg (Friia) are attested together in later Old Norse sources (though not as sisters), and theories have been proposed that the Fulla may at one time have been an aspect of Frigg. This notion has resulted in a theory that a similar situation may have existed between the figures of Sinthgunt and S√≥l, in that the two may have been understood as aspects of one another rather than entirely separate figures.Bostock (1976:29). Similarly, Wolfgang Beck analysed her as a subordinate goddess from Sunna's retinue, a kind of \\"situation goddess\\", based on her unique appearance in the sources.Wolfgang Beck: Die Merseburger Zauberspr√ºche, pp. 163‚Äì171, here p. 171. Friedrich Kauffmann grouped Sinhtgunt as a valkyrie in the 19th century, because the elements -gund and -hild appear frequently in their names.Friedrich Kauffmann: Der Zweite Merseburger Zauberspruch. In: Beitr√§ge zur Geschichte der deutschen Sprache und Literatur 15 (1891), pp. 207‚Äì210; Friedrich Kauffmann: Noch einmal der zweite Merseburger Spruch. In: Zeitschrift f√ºr deutsche Philologie 26 (1894), pp. 454‚Äì462. Stefan Schaffner and Heiner Eichner more recently agreed with him, based on G√ºnter M√ºller's paper on the valkyries' healing powers.Gunter M√ºller: Zur Heilkraft der Walk√ºren. Sondersprachliches der Magie in kontinentalen und skandinavischen Zeugnissen. In: Fr√ºhmittelalterliche Studien 10 (1976), pp. 358 ff. Karl Heim rejected Kauffmann and grouped Sinhtgunt with the Idisi of the first Merseburg Incantation, as a specially defined group of Germanic goddesses.Karl Helm: Altgermanische Religionsgeschichte, Vol. 2.2, Universit√§tsverlag Winter, Heidelberg 1953, pp. 219, 227.

It featured Prem Rawat, then known as Guru Maharaj Ji, a 15-year-old guru and the leader of a fast-growing new religious movement. Organizers billed the festival as the most significant event in human history which would usher in a thousand years of peace. The festival's official schedule described the three evening addresses by Guru Maharaj Ji as the highlights of the event. Big-band music, rock bands, religious songs, choral works, a dance performance and speeches by other DLM leaders filled the program from noon to 10 pm. Media events included press conferences and an impromptu debate. Millennium '73 received wide publicity. Rennie Davis, a prominent anti-war activist and member of the Chicago Seven, helped draw attention to the event as a spokesman for the DLM. Notable journalists attended, some of them acquaintances of Davis from the New Left. It was later described by some scholars and journalists as among the major events of 1973 and the 1970s, the high point of Guru Maharaj Ji's popularity, and the most important development in the American DLM's history. Attendance was estimated from 10,000 to 35,000, compared to the projected 100,000. Many scholars and journalists generally depicted the event as a disappointment. That, along with other factors including a large debt, led to changes in the DLM's structure, management and message. The following year the movement split into branches headed by Maharaj Ji in the West, and his mother and brother Bal Bhagwan Ji in India. Before the event Background Guru Maharaj Ji arriving in France on July 14, 1971 Hans Ji Maharaj, who taught secret meditation techniques called \\"Knowledge\\", founded the Divine Light Mission (DLM) in India in 1960. Hans Ji, called \\"Guru Maharaj Ji\\", died six years later and was succeeded as spiritual leader and Perfect Master by his eight-year-old youngest son, who adopted his father's title. As the young Guru Maharaj Ji was a minor, his mother, Mata Ji, and the eldest son, Bal Bhagwan Ji, managed the DLM's affairs., ch. 12 By 1971, when the 13-year-old Guru Maharaj Ji made his first tours of the United Kingdom and United States, the Indian DLM claimed over five million members (known as \\"premies\\"). Within two years the DLM had as many as 50,000 members in the US, with thousands more in the UK and other countries and as many as six million in India. Most of the Western followers were young people from the 1960s counterculture. The DLM celebrated three annual festivals, the largest of which, \\"Hans Jayanti\\", commemorated Hans Ji Maharaj's birthday on November 9. The Hans Jayanti festivals held in India in the early 1970s were well-attended, attracting audiences of up to a million people, including Westerners. Mata Ji and the 22-year-old Bal Bhagwan Ji decided that the 1973 Hans Jayanti should be held in the United States; it was the first to be held outside India. The movement invested all of its resources in the event, with an overall budget of close to US$1,000,000, including $75,000 to rent the Astrodome and $100,000 for publicity. The DLM paid for many of the international charter flights that brought followers to Houston. DLM members were under pressure to contribute money to support the event. Organizers invited hundreds of reporters from all over the country, hoping to achieve positive media exposure for Maharaj Ji. Millenarian appeal In the late 1960s and early 1970s, many people in the US, especially hippies, believed that the world was on the verge of a new era, the Age of Aquarius. This new age was expected to be characterized by peace and love, harmony and understanding. By the late autumn of 1973 there was an \\"apocalyptic chill in the air\\", as headlines dealt with the Vietnam war, the Watergate scandal, the Agnew resignation, a war in the Middle East, an energy crisis, mass murders in Houston and California, and UFO sightings across the South. Sociologist James V. Downton wrote that the millenarian appeal of the DLM prior to the festival sprang from a belief that Guru Maharaj Ji was the Lord, and that a new age of peace would begin under his leadership. These hopes appealed to the counterculture youth of the time, who were disillusioned with earlier attempts at political and cultural revolution and who were turning their aspirations in a spiritual direction. Downton describes these aspirations as encouraging millennial beliefs within the DLM, including the \\"psychological trappings of surrender and idealization.\\" He states the guru's mother, whose satsang was \\"full of references to his divine nature\\", aided these beliefs, as did the guru himself, \\"for letting others cast him in the role of the Lord.\\" Maharaj Ji's appeal to followers to give up beliefs and concepts did not prevent them \\"from adopting a fairly rigid set of ideas about his divinity and the coming of a new age.\\" In a meeting with members, DLM President Bob Mishler denied that the event would start the millennium and said they called it \\"Millennium '73\\" because the word \\"millennium\\" evoked the \\"vision of one peaceful world based on spiritual values\\". Promotion The Mission's most prominent member was anti-war activist and Chicago Seven defendant Rennie Davis, who had first met Guru Maharaj Ji in February 1973. Davis was appointed vice president of the organization a short time later and served as general coordinator for the Millennium festival. His conversion was the topic of numerous newspaper articles, as it reportedly shook the New Left from coast to coast. An energetic promoter of his new guru and of Millennium '73, Davis traveled across the United States on a 21-city tour, speaking to what he said were about a million people a day through radio and television interviews. He told people that Guru Maharaj Ji was the solution to civilization's problems. Davis was not always well-received, particularly by his former comrades in the peace movement (one Berkeley newspaper had the headline \\"Rennie Unites Left ‚Äì Against Him\\"), and was heckled at some of his appearances., The Chicago Seven retrial was underway in the fall of 1973, and the judge gave Davis a dispensation to attend the festival. Several associates of Davis from the left also attended, some as journalists. A two-week, eight-city, 500-person tour, called \\"Soul Rush\\", was organized to promote Millennium '73. At a stop in Washington, D.C. premies (DLM members) gathered in front of the White House and invited President Richard Nixon to attend the festival and receive Knowledge. One reporter for the Village Voice who traveled in the tour wrote that they had little press coverage and poor attendance but showed obvious energy, and that the tour itself went remarkably smoothly with expressions of love among the members. At each city, the touring group and local premies paraded in the morning, and a drama troupe performed in the afternoon. The main event was the free evening performance by Blue Aquarius, a 50 to 60-piece band led by Bhole Ji, Maharaj Ji's 20-year-old brother, referred to as the \\"Lord of Music\\" by Davis and others., The band was composed of professional and amateur musicians who donated their efforts, and its leading member was drummer Geoff Bridgeford, formerly of the Bee Gees. It went on to anchor the Houston festival. Press releases and a festival poster announced that the event would mark the beginning of \\"a thousand years of peace for people who want peace\\", the idea being that peace could come to the world as individuals experienced inner peace. A flyer said, \\"Now the turning point in human civilization is here. ... The Dawn of the New Age.\\" In a letter to premies inviting them attend the festival, which had only been celebrated in India up to that point, Guru Maharaj Ji said, \\"This year the most Holy and significant event in human history will take place in America\\". The \\"Call to Millennium\\" announcement published in the DLM publication And It Is Divine said that \\"Guru Maharaj Ji has proved to us that an age of peace is possible, now, ... Peace is needed. And peace shall be obtained. ... [Guru Maharaj Ji] will present to the world a plan for putting peace into effect.\\" Expectations and rumors Official DLM literature predicted the dawn of a new age of peace, the Age of Aquarius, and some followers expected dramatic change or even the Second Coming of Jesus. In a letter to premies inviting them to attend the festival, Guru Maharaj Ji said, \\"This is a festival not for you or me. It is for the whole world and maybe the whole universe.\\" He urged them to support the festival, saying, \\"Isn't it about time you all get together and help me bring peace to this Earth?\\" Rennie Davis promised that a practical plan for world peace would be revealed. Sociologist Thomas Pilarzyk wrote that devotees made \\"bizarre, 'cultic'\\" predictions, and suggested that their excitement validated the significance of the event. A member remarked that even normally realistic followers were swayed by the collective fantasies. Sophia Collier, a teenaged member who later left the movement and published a memoir, said that a minority of members, mostly limited to Houston, became victims of a \\"Millennium Fever\\" promoted chiefly by Bal Bhagwan Ji. The majority of the premies repeated Bal Bhagwan Ji's ideas out of astonishment, but some actually believed him. Journalists noted that some followers perceived the predicted appearance of Comet Kohoutek as an omen, as a spaceship on its way to Houston, or as the return of the Star of Bethlehem. A frequently repeated prediction, attributed to Maharaj Ji, was that the Astrodome would levitate., Davis and others made often-reported predictions, repeated in half-jest, that extraterrestrials would attend the festival. Bal Bhagwan Ji is said to have predicted the festival would be preceded by earthquakes in New York and Denver, along with a dive in the stock markets. Sociologist Downton wrote that there were runaway expectations about attendance. Public predictions of attendance grew larger: from 100,000 to 144,000 (the number foretold in the Book of Revelation for the Second Coming), to 200,000 and even 400,000. (The capacity of the Astrodome was 66,000.) Davis told one audience that millions would attend. Bob Mishler, the founding president of the DLM in the United States, later said he had tried to slow the growing expectations. He said he had only expected 20,000‚Äì25,000 and that he toured the country explaining to members that the festival would be significant because of what happened there, not because of the number of attendees. He said he tried to remind them that the aim was to establish peace on Earth, not to travel to another planet. Festival Rainbow Brigade During the summer prior to the festival, 380 followers worked full-time in Houston preparing for the event. Known as the \\"Rainbow Brigade\\", their motto was \\"Work Is Worship\\". The total staff for the festival eventually numbered 4,000. Fifteen hundred festival volunteers stayed at a former Coca-Cola plant, renamed the \\"Peace Plant\\" for the occasion, where they slept on folded blankets over the concrete floor. Another thousand stayed at the Rainbow Inn motel. Reporters wrote that the volunteers maintained a tight and professional operation, and showed the egalitarian obedience of the Israeli Army or a monastery. One reporter wrote that he never saw a premie lose his temper. Another noted that the workers seemed to be \\"model human beings, perhaps even on their way to becoming the 'new evolutionary species' that they claim will establish heaven on earth\\". World Peace Corps The World Peace Corps (WPC), headed by Maharaj Ji's 19-year-old youngest brother, Raja Ji, was the DLM's security force at the event. Raja Ji said its job was \\"to make sure that whatever is happening, happens correctly\\". One of the security group's main tasks was keeping followers away from the guru. Journalists reported being pushed around and threatened by the mostly English guards. The guards were seen by one reporter as exemplifying \\"the inevitable violence of any millennial sect hell-bent on abstract purity and infinite happiness\\". The World Peace Corps' name was called doublespeak and compared to the Big Lie. An observer was quoted as saying, \\"These people were mad with a sense of divinity-authorized power. It was like descending into the ninth ring of hell.\\" And It Is Divine special issue The DLM's magazine And It Is Divine published a special edition for the event. The 78-page magazine, with Maharaj Ji listed as the Editor-in- Chief, included an invitation to the event, the festival program, and a history of the festival. One article profiled the \\"Holy Family\\" (Guru Maharaj Ji, his mother, and three older brothers), illustrated with individual portraits and a group photograph. The festival invitation said, \\"Three years ago, at the 1970 Hans Jayanti, the present Guru Maharaj Ji proclaimed he would establish world peace. This year at Millennium '73 he will set in motion his plan to bring peace on earth ... for a thousand years.\\" An article compared the nations of the world to the coyote in the Roadrunner cartoons who, blinded by the prize he is chasing, runs off the end of the cliff and falls. An unsigned article, titled \\"Prophets of the Millennium\\", referred to prophecies from the Book of Isaiah, Hindu scripture, American Indians, Edgar Cayce, Jeanne Dixon, and others. The article noted that prophecies tend to come true, that there are many predictions that the savior will be a child or will come from the East. It concluded by asking whether Guru Maharaj Ji might be that prophesied \\"Great Savior\\". Hobby Airport arrival The arrival of Guru Maharaj Ji and his family on Wednesday, November 7, 1973 was the first big event of the festival. A crowd of 3,000 young, clean-cut followers waited for two or three hours at Hobby Airport, a delay that annoyed impatient reporters. While they waited, premies covered Maharaj Ji's emerald-green Rolls-Royce with flowers. A follower told a reporter they wanted him to have the best because he is like a king, as opposed to Christ who was like a beggar. After his late arrival, Maharaj Ji spoke for a few minutes, saying to the assembled, > It's really fantastic and really beautiful to see you here, the Millennium > program will start tomorrow and it'll really be fantastic, it'll be > incredible ... and soon people will get together and finally understand who > is God. ... There's so much trouble in the world, Watergate is not only in > America, it exists everywhere. The premies were smiling and radiant, a state they called \\"blissed out\\". One reporter said that to \\"look at a blissed-out premie is to peer into an empty house through spotless windows\\". The phrase \\"blissed out\\" was used in many reports of the festival, even in their titles, which are cited by the Oxford English Dictionary for the phrase's first uses. The Rawat family stayed in the Astrodome's six-bedroom, $2,500 Celestial Suite. Rennie Davis commented on the cosmic appropriateness of the names of the suite and of the master bedroom, and of the faucets shaped like swans (the guru's symbol).. Davis said that the Astrodome was built for the festival, a sentiment which an Astrodome manager said was shared by every religious group that held an event there. Stage, signs and effects The interior of the Astrodome (picture from 2004, after the removal of the Astrolite sign) Architect and follower Larry Bernstein said he designed the stage not for the audience in the Astrodome, but for the TV cameras. The -high multilevel set fit easily at one end of the field under the dome's roof. The set, made of glowing white Plexiglas, was described as striking in appearance, yet, it was reportedly dwarfed by the vast size of the Astrodome. At the highest level was the guru's throne. Lower levels held the \\"Holy Family\\", the mahatmas (sometimes described as the priests or apostles of the DLM), and the Blue Aquarius band led by Bhole Ji Rawat, who wore a silver- sequined suit while conducting. Red carpeting covered the AstroTurf. Projected on huge white screens above the set were rainbows and images of the turmoil of the 1960s. The Astrolite, Astrodome's enormous electronic signboard, flashed animated fireworks (the same that were shown during ballgames), representations of Maharaj Ji, and a variety of slogans, scriptural citations, and announcements: * Sugar is Sweet/So are You/Guru Maharaj Ji * The Holy Breath will fill this place/And you will be baptized in Holy Breath * All premies interested in doing/Propagation in Morocco please contact/Millennium Information at the Royal Coach Inn * Happiness is not in the material world. It is the property of God * Attention, Attention/Please do not run and dance/Thank you, Guru Maharaj Ji * Realize heaven on earth * You will sit in your assigned places, please Program Each day's program opened and closed with the singing of Aarti, called an \\"ancient devotional song of praise to the Perfect Master\\". According to reports before the festival, its three themes were to be \\"Who is Guru Maharaj Ji\\", \\"Guru Maharaj Ji is Here\\", and \\"The Messiah Has Come\\", though the official schedule in November had a different list. Maharaj Ji watched the proceedings on closed-circuit television in his suite, and sent his bodyguard down with a can of pink foam confetti to spray the crowd on his behalf, reported as an example of lila, or divine play. In addition to the main program, mahatmas were conducting initiations into Knowledge at local ashrams, and the guru and his family were offering darshan, or holy presence, to initiates. ;Day 1 ‚Äì \\"What is a Perfect Master?\\" The first day of the festival was Thursday, November 8, 1973. The program listed the topic of the day as \\"What is a Perfect Master?\\" It started at noon with an oratorio composed for the occasion by Erika Anderson. Rennie Davis opened the program by telling the audience that, \\"All I can say is, honestly, very soon now, every single human being will know the one who was waited for by every religion of all times has actually come\\" The masters of ceremony were Joan Apter, an early US convert and one of Maharaj Ji's secretaries, and Charles Cameron, one of the guru's earliest converts in the UK and editor of Who Is Guru Maharaj Ji? Cameron told stories of previous Perfect Masters. After that came a pageant reenacting scenes from the life of Jesus Christ. In the afternoon Bal Bhagwan Ji delivered a spiritual discourse, or satsang. Rhythm and blues musician Eric Mercury performed during the dinner interval. Stax Records had negotiated an agreement with the DLM to make a recording of the event in exchange for showcasing Mercury, one of their new acts. They had already released an album titled \\"Blue Aquarius\\" in 1973 that was on sale at the event. Mercury, a Canadian of African ancestry and the only non-member who performed, played before an audience of 5,000 or fewer. Stax recorded the performance and Mercury said at a press conference that he would give 50 percent of his royalties from the album to the DLM. He later told a reporter that while he was interested in the message initially, he was put off by the pressure to join for what he perceived as an effort to gain ethnic diversity. Following Mercury was a speech by Bob Mishler and then an hour-long set by the Blue Aquarius orchestra. The highlight of the evening was a satsang by Maharaj Ji: > You want to be the richest man in the world? I can make you rich. I have the > only currency that doesn't go down ... People think I'm a smuggler. You > betcha I am. I smuggle peace and truth from one country to another. This > currency is really rich. But if you think I'm a smuggler then Jesus Christ > was a smuggler and so was Lord Krishna and Mohammed. Maharaj Ji said to the crowd, \\"Try it, you'll like it.\\" (This was the catchphrase from a popular 1971 ad campaign for Alka Seltzer.) ;Day 2 ‚Äì \\"The Perfect Master is Here\\" The second day of the festival, Friday, November 9, had the theme of \\"The Perfect Master is Here\\". It featured speeches by mahatmas and by Maharaj Ji's mother, Mata Ji. The Divine Light Dance Ensemble performed a dance piece, Krishna Lila, noted for being well-choreographed. Music included another choral composition by Erika Anderson, another long set by Blue Aquarius, and a performance by the Apostles, a devotional rock band. Maharaj Ji wore a red Krishna robe and later put on a jeweled crown of Krishna, the \\"Crown of Crowns for the King of Kings\\". His satsang that night included this story: > Imagine if you wanted a Superman comic real bad. And you go all over asking > people if they've got one. You go to all the bookstores and to all the kids > in the colleges, and all the people on the streets and no one has one > anywhere. And you're real depressed and you're sitting there in the park and > this little kid comes up and says \\"Hey man, how'd you like a Superman > comic.\\" And you say, \\"G'wan. You don't have one.\\" And this kid pulls it from > out of his shirt and it is a genuine; a gen-u-ine Superman comic: and you > look at it and say, \\"Hey man; this must be very expensive\\", and he says, > \\"No, take it, it's yours. It's free.\\" And you don't believe him but then you > take it. He just gives it to you. Well if you can imagine that, you can > imagine what Knowledge would mean to you. ;Day 3 ‚Äì \\"World Assemblage to Save Humanity\\" The third and last day of the festival, Saturday, November 10, was called a \\"World Assemblage to Save Humanity\\". A talk by another brother, Raja Ji, and more performances by Blue Aquarius and the Apostles filled the schedule. Plans for the Divine United Organization and the Divine City were announced. Rennie Davis gave a speech that one reporter called the oratorical high point of the festival. \\"I tell you now that it is springtime on this earth!\\" Jerry Rubin, a co-defendant in the Chicago Seven trial, said he had never heard Davis sound more dangerous. The climax of the event was the final satsang by Maharaj Ji, in which he laid out his plan for peace. According to one reporter his basic message was, \\"You want peace? Give me a try. Let me have a try. I'll establish peace. It's a simple deal.\\" One analogy by Maharaj Ji that several reporters noted compared the techniques of Knowledge to a fuel filter: > The thing is that this life is a big car, and inside the car there is a big > engine. And in the engine there is a carburetor, which is hooked up to a > fuel line. In some cars, before the fuel line hits the carburetor, there is > a thing called a filter that makes sure the fuel going into the carburetor > is pure. So in this life, the filter for our minds is the Knowledge, and if > we are not being filtered properly, many dirty particles enter our minds and > eventually the whole engine is destroyed. After the satsang he was presented by grateful premies with a golden sculpture of a swan and a marble plaque depicting a lion and a lamb lying down together. The event concluded after a short performance by the Blue Aquarius orchestra. After the program, volunteers hurried to clear the field of the stage and carpeting in time for a football game the next afternoon. Attendance Notable members attending the event included Sophia Collier, Rennie Davis, and Timothy Gallwey. Journalists, writers, observers, and guests included James Downton, Marjoe Gortner, Robert Greenfield, Paul Krassner, Bob Larson, Wavy Gravy, Annie Leibovitz, Jerry Rubin, Robert Scheer, Michael Shamberg, John Sinclair, and Loudon Wainwright III. Overall attendance was predominantly estimated at 20,000, with other estimates ranging from 10,000 to 35,000.Attendance was estimated at 20,000 by , , , , , , , , and . It was estimated by Houston Police to be 10,000, according to . estimated 35,000. Chartered planes brought followers from several dozen countries; with designated seating sections for attendees from France, Sweden, India, Spain, and even, as a joke, Mars. In addition to the seats reserved for the ETs within the stadium, a corner of the parking lot was set aside for their ship. Bal Bhagwan Ji reportedly told a follower who asked about the low attendance that there were actually 150,000 beings there. The premies were reported to be cheerful and friendly. Unlike most youth gatherings of the era, there was no scent of marijuana or tobacco, only incense. Though the movement's membership included former street people, radicals, and drug users,Foss & Larkin, quoted in they now appeared clean-cut and neatly dressed. Male followers wore suits and ties, and women wore long dresses. When Maharaj Ji was present, his followers raised their arms towards him, and chanted \\"Bolie Shri Satgurudev Maharaj ki jai!\\" (\\"All praise to the Perfect Master, giver of life\\"). One reporter called them cheerleaders. Four journalists compared it to scenes at the Nuremberg stadium., , Steve Haines (1973), quoted in Four hundred parents of DLM members sat in a special section high above the floor of the dome. Many parents appreciated Maharaj Ji for rehabilitating their prodigal children. One mother explained how her son had stopped using drugs and was happier after receiving Knowledge, and that she had been initiated, too. A follower said some of the parents looked a little embarrassed. Opposition groups Local Baptist churches took out a full-page newspaper advertisement warning of false prophets. A group of Christians stationed themselves outside the Astrodome and prayed. Hare Krishna, Jesus Freaks, Children of God and the Jews for Jesus protested loudly and sought converts. Members of the Christian Information Committee drove from Berkeley, California. A Christian evangelical anti-cult group, Spiritual Counterfeits Project, had its origin in the event. The picketing groups fought with each other, harassed attendees, and vandalized cars owned by DLM members. Organizers called the police to clear Hare Krishna protesters who were blocking the arena entrances and as many as thirty-one of them were arrested for disorderly conduct. The Hare Krishnas protested that Maharaj Ji was being called an incarnation of Krishna, while the Jesus Freaks protested that Maharaj Ji was a false messiah and the Antichrist. In response, Maharaj Ji said at one of his satsangs, \\"They must be drunk. When the real Antichrist comes they won't even recognize him. He'll be too professional.\\" Media coverage Between fifty and three hundred reporters covered the event. It received extensive coverage from the print media, though not the national television news coverage that organizers expected (there had been predictions that Walter Cronkite would cover it live). The New York Times and Rolling Stone both sent two reporters each, and it was also covered by the Washington Post, the Chicago Tribune, the Los Angeles Times, the Los Angeles Free Press, the Detroit Free Press, the Village Voice, The Rag of Houston, and the Houston Chronicle. Magazines covering the festival included Time, Newsweek, the New York Review of Books, Ramparts Magazine, Creem, Texas Monthly, The Realist, Crawdaddy, Playboy, Penthouse, and Oui. Journalists Marilyn Webb, Robert Scheer, Robert Greenfield, and Ken Kelley had been following or even living with the DLM for weeks or months prior to the festival. KPFT-FM, a local progressive radio station, covered the event: Paul Krassner, John Sinclair, Jeff Nightbyrd, and Jerry Rubin were co-anchors. They reportedly mocked the festival and its attendees. Not realizing this, the festival organizers piped the signal throughout the Astrodome until the nature of the coverage became apparent. Loudon Wainwright III, who made a guest appearance on KPFT, later said that Maharaj Ji partly inspired his song \\"I am the Way\\". Top Value Television (TVTV) chose the Millennium '73 festival as a topic for a documentary, titled Lord of the Universe. TVTV was a documentary production company that had just received acclaim for its groundbreaking piece on the 1972 Republican National Convention. They used Portapak cameras and newly developed recording technology that allowed them to shoot handheld video of broadcast quality. Two teams followed a member and the Soul Rush tour prior to the event. Led by producer Michael Shamberg, five camera teams recorded 80 hours of video at the festival itself. Chicago Seven codefendant Abbie Hoffman, who did not attend, provided commentary. Premie Sophia Collier wrote that the TVTV crew seemed to start filming whenever someone said anything fanatical or ill-conceived. PBS television stations across the US broadcast the documentary in the spring of 1974 and again in the summer. The documentary went on to win a DuPont-Columbia Award in 1974 for excellence in broadcast journalism., , Reporters were angered and alienated by their treatment. Rules and passes for media access were changed daily with no apparent logic. A female reporter wrote of being shoved a few times by WPC members. Another reporter said the DLM assigned him a guide to accompany him at all times to answer questions. Robert Scheer later wrote of being told by a press agent that the Venusians were landing and he could be the first to cover them if he hurried out to the parking lot. According to Collier, journalists found the event to be a confusing jumble of poorly expressed ideas. One reporter complained of the lack of content. The national press was more concerned with finances and organization than with \\"feeling the Knowledge\\", by one account. Collier complained about the coverage in general and especially about an article by the Village Voice's Marilyn Webb that featured her, saying that the article was inaccurate and misrepresented her beliefs. Davis told reporters that he was aware of the perceptions of the event by outsiders, and admitted that the huge stage, flashing lights, and a kid giving parables about cars did not make for a good show. In June 1974, the DLM's Divine Times newspaper printed an analysis of the press coverage. It criticized articles written about the festival, saying they portrayed Maharaj Ji as materialistic whose followers were misguided. The only article it approved of was in a children's magazine. The review also admitted that the DLM had made a number of mistakes and that the press relations were improper and inept. Carole Greenberg, head of DLM Information Services, said, \\"We took something subtle and sacred and tried to market it to the public.\\" She said the press had done the movement a favor by holding up a mirror that showed \\"the garbage we gave them\\". The article went on to say that the greatest botch was Guru Maharaj Ji's press conference. Press conference Maharaj Ji's press conference, hastily arranged for the morning of Friday, November 9, was noted for leaving the reporters frustrated and hostile because of what they described as flippant, manipulative, and arrogant answers, and because of an effort to pack the room with supporters. Several dozen followers, mostly foreign, jostled reporters, asked long and complimentary questions, and shouted \\"Boli Shri\\" or \\"Jai Satchitanand\\" following the answers. According to the Divine Times some of the reporters acted like \\"district attorneys interrogating a hostile witness\\". A reporter from Newsweek complained that the evasive responses reminded him of a recent Watergate press conference with White House Press Secretary Ron Ziegler, while another observer called it \\"Nixonian\\". :Question: Are you the messiah? :Answer: Please do not presume that. I am a humble servant of God, trying to establish peace in the world. :Q: Why is there such a great contradiction between what you say about yourself and what your followers say about you? :A: Well, why don't you do me a favor ... why don't you go to the devotees and ask their explanation about it? :Q: It's hard for some people to understand how you personally can live so luxuriously in your several homes and your Rolls-Royces :A: That life that you call luxurious ain't luxurious at all, because if any other person gets the same life I get, he's gonna blow apart in a million pieces in a split of a second. ... People have made Rolls- Royce a heck of a car, only it's a piece of tin with a V8 engine which probably a Chevelle Concourse has. :Q: Why don't you sell it and give food to people? :A: What good would it do. All that's gonna happen is they will need more and I don't have other Rolls-Royces. I will sell everything and I'll walk and still they will be hungry. :Q: Guru, what happened to the reporter in Detroit who was badly beaten by your followers? [Following the question, Maharaj Ji's press aide tried to change the subject, accusing the questioner of hogging the floor.] :A: I think you ought to find out what happened to everything. The conference, which lasted nearly an hour, ended shortly after descending into a shambles when reporters pressed for information about the Detroit incident, in which a reporter who had thrown a pie at Maharaj Ji a few months prior was subsequently beaten by two DLM members. As of 1976, it was Maharaj Ji's last press conference. Krassner‚ÄìDavis debate Paul Krassner repeatedly challenged Rennie Davis to a debate and Davis finally agreed. It was held in the adjoining Astrohall convention center on the third day, Saturday, November 10, and attended by 30 reporters. The question was, \\"Resolved: That Davis has copped out to turn kids away from social responsibility to personal escape\\". Ken Kelley was the moderator and KPFT-FM broadcast it live. Repeating accusations he had been making through the summer, Krassner said that the movement was part of a CIA-directed conspiracy. He called it a neo-Fascist discipline, said Maharaj Ji was a mystic hired to seduce the youth movement into oblivion, and called him the spiritual equivalent of Mark Spitz. He asked, \\"Did the Maharaj Ji give Richard Nixon a secret contribution?\\", to which Davis replied, \\"Yes ‚Äì he gave Richard Nixon his life.\\" Davis said the most important point was that \\"the Lord is on the planet and he has the secret of life\\", and that Maharaj Ji would lead \\"the most serious revolution ever to take place in the history of the world\\". He said the main battleground now is \\"the struggle between the mind and the soul\\" in each person. Reporters said that Davis stayed poised while Krassner heckled. Afterwards Two sociologists described Millennium '73 as the youth culture event of the year. Journalists listed it among the notable events of the 1970s., Indian writer Vishal Mangalwadi called the festival the zenith of Maharaj Ji's popularity. The festival did not live up to expectations of establishing peace or world transformation. According to reports, the Astrodome did not levitate, no UFOs landed, and no ETs attended. Journalists and scholars called the festival a dismal failure, a fiasco, a major setback, a disastrous rally, a great disappointment, and a \\"depressing show unnoticed by most\\". According to James T. Richardson, the event left the movement \\"in dire financial straits and bereft of credibility\\".James T. Richardson in Religious scholar Robert S. Ellwood wrote that Maharaj Ji's \\"meteoric career collapsed into scandal and debt\\" after the event. Maharaj Ji gave no public indication that he was disappointed, although one reporter said he appeared to be nonplussed by the turnout. He remarked privately on how perfect it was and called the event fantastic. Three months after the event Davis said that it was significant despite the low attendance, noting that only a small number of people were at the Sermon on the Mount or the Last Supper. In a June 1974 interview, Mishler said that the love which filled the Astrodome was the beginning of the human race, and that only those who came to it with expectations were disappointed. Some members expected world transformation and there were many reports of members being disappointed. According to sociologists Foss and Larkin, some members saw the failure to meet expectations as another example of lila. Downton, who attended the festival, said the followers tried to find nice things to say about the event but that it appeared to him they were trying to hide ruined dreams. One member said that the excitement was over and that followers could not believe that the world had not changed. A member from an Orthodox Jewish background was disenchanted and began to doubt that Maharaj Ji held all the answers, according to his sister's memoir. Janet McDonald, an African American woman attending Vassar College, said that her \\"faith was brutally dashed to bits\\" at the festival because of its failure to meet her expectations of miracles and by her embarrassment at lining up for hours to kiss the white-socked foot of Mata Ji. She left the movement soon after. Sophia Collier said that she woke up on the bottling plant floor the next morning wondering why she was there, though she decided to try to repair the movement's public image. Debt The DLM leadership had expected that a huge attendance would be followed by generous donations. Millennium '73 was free, unlike other DLM festivals that charged sizable fees. Despite fundraising before the event, lower than expected attendance and mismanagement left the DLM in serious debt, estimated at $682,000. Individual members also carried debts incurred for traveling expenses. The festival was financed with short-term credit that began coming due right after the event. Seeking payment, creditors, including the Astrodome management, pursued the DLM and repossessed property belonging to the mission. By mid-1974, NBC reported that about $150,000 was still owed and that 25 vendors had received no payments at all. Members of the DLM took on extra work in order to raise money at Maharaj Ji's suggestion. The debt forced the sale or closure of the DLM's printing and other businesses, the temporary shutdown of their newspaper and magazine,, the disbanding of Blue Aquarius, and the shelving of new initiatives. In 1976, a DLM spokesman said that the debt had been reduced to $80,000 and that the mission was on a sound financial footing. Impact Thomas Pilarzyk described the festival as the \\"most important development\\" in the American movement's history. James V. Downton opined that the movement ultimately failed in achieving its millennial dream of world peace. The failure to meet expectations, along with the debt and bad press, led to significant changes in the movement. Scholars describe 1973 as the peak year of the movement, or mention a significant drop in new followers. However, Roger E. Olson wrote that \\"the movement continued to attract large numbers of mainly counterculture followers\\" despite the disappointments. The financial crisis required retrenchment and reorganization. After the festival, Maharaj Ji began taking greater responsibility in the movement; he took administrative control of the DLM's US branch within a month of turning 16. The following year he got married and became an emancipated minor. Disagreements between Maharaj Ji and his family led to the movement being split between a Western branch, led by Maharaj Ji, and an Indian branch, run by his mother and Bal Bhagwan Ji. The failure of Millennium '73 led the Western branch to shift away from Indian influences and trappings, according to some observers., Sikh scholar Kirpal Singh Khalsa wrote that the DLM \\"no longer projected itself as a movement that would include all of humanity in its membership.\\" The Western DLM moved away from its ascetic, \\"world-rejecting\\" origins and adopted a \\"world-affirming position\\". Beginning in 1982, Guru Maharaj Ji changed the DLM into the more loosely organized Elan Vital. Michael York wrote that, as result of poor attendance and financial failure, Maharaj Ji changed the name of the movement and \\"distanced himself from his status as a divine guru\\". He became known as Maharaji or Prem Rawat and was presented as an inspirational speaker and teacher. Bal Bhagwan Ji became known as Satpal Maharaj or Satpal Rawat, and his branch is now known as Manav Utthan Seva Samiti. Both branches have celebrated Hans Jayanti again since 1973., Notes References  * * reprinted on   Also in   * * , in    Further reading  External links Category:1973 in the United States Category:Prem Rawat Category:Religious festivals in the United States Category:Festivals in Texas Category:Hindu festivals ","title":"Millennium '73"},{"id":"17666421","text":"Reginald III of Guelders ( or Renaud, known as \\"The Fat\\") (13 May 1333 ‚Äì 4 December 1371) was Duke of Guelders and Count of Zutphen from 1343 to 1361, and again in 1371. He was the son of Reginald II of Guelders and of Eleanor of Woodstock, daughter of Edward II of England. With the death of his father in 1343, his mother held the regency until 1344. From 1350, his brother Edward asserted his rights and a quarrel of succession broke out between the two brothers until 1361. Reginald was overcome in Tiel and was imprisoned in the castle of Nijenbeek. There he became so large that he could not have left, even if the door had remained open‚Äîhence his appellation \\"The Fat\\". Edward died on 24 August 1371, having been mortally wounded in the Battle of Baesweiler, and Reginald was released (according to the legend, the walls had to be cut away so he could leave); he held the ducal throne for only a short period, dying a few months later. He was buried at Graefenthal Abbey. As he did not have a legitimate child, the succession passed to his sisters: Mathilde (also, Machteld), who was married to John II, Count of Blois, and Maria, wife of William II of J√ºlich and mother to William I of Guelders and J√ºlich, on whose behalf she claimed the throne of Guelders. The sisters and their respective followers (the Heeckerens, from the party led by families of Van Heeckeren and their relatives, the Van Rechterens, supported Mathilde, while the faction known as the Bronkhorsters followed Maria) fought for the duchy of Guelders in the War of the Succession of Guelders. Marriage and children He married, in Tervuren on 1 July 1347, Marie of Brabant (1325‚Äì1399), lady of Turnhout, daughter of John III, Duke of Brabant and Marie d'Evreux. They did not have children, but Reginald had an illegitimate son, Johan (Jan) of Hattem, and an illegitimate daughter, Ponte of Guelders, who married Johan van Groesbeek (d. 1428), lord of Heumen and Malden.

However it still attracts a cult following and in 2007 was admitted to the Canon van de Nederlandse Film. Flodder is also a Dutch word meaning blank cartridge, a referral to the Flodders looking dangerous and being noisy, despite being rather harmless. Plot When it emerges that the Flodder family's current state-owned house is on a toxic waste dump, the city council is forced to find somewhere to move them. Social worker, Sjakie, proposes to move the family to an upper-class neighbourhood hoping that the change in social environment will have a positive effect on the problematic family. However the family fails to adapt and persists in their anti-social lifestyle which clashes with the values of the reserved upper class inhabitants of the neighbourhood, who try everything in their power to get rid of the Flodders. This results in several confrontations between individual members of the family and the upper class inhabitants. The town council, being aware of the problems the family is causing, starts looking into alternative living accommodations, although Sjakie keeps insisting that the family should be given another chance. In the meantime son Johnny starts a relationship with neighbour Yolanda Kruisman, much to the fury of her husband. This culminates at a neighbourhood meeting being held to discuss how to get rid of the family. Johnny and Yolanda walk in announcing their engagement. They decide to throw a party where everyone is invited. Meanwhile, the town council finds a suitable alternative house for the family, but Ma Flodder discovers she has inherited a large sum of money from Opa Flodder who recently died in a train accident. With the money she decides to buy the house in which they are living. The climax of the film is the engagement party, which is attended by everyone and quickly gets out of hand; the people from the neighbourhood however have a great time and finally start to appreciate the family as they are. In the meantime, Yolanda's husband goes to the army base where he works and takes one of the army tanks. In the finale of the film he destroys the house of the Flodders who take it with good humour.

It was admitted to the Canon van de Nederlandse Film in 2007. In 1987 it won a Gouden Kalf for best Art Direction. Sequel The film was followed by two sequels, Flodder in Amerika (1992) and Flodder 3 (1995). A spin-off television series ran from 1993 to 1998. Qu√©bec version The film was shown in Qu√©bec in Canada, where it was dubbed into joual (a working class Qu√©bec French dialect) under the title Les Lavigueur d√©m√©nagent (The Lavigueurs are moving) where it has a cult following. The name Lavigueur was taken from a Montreal working-class family who had made headlines in 1986 after winning what was then the largest jackpot ever awarded in a Canadian lottery, at 6/49. The family ‚Äï except for Yve Lavigueur ‚Äï attempted to sue the filmmakers, but they could do nothing as nobody owns a particular last name, especially a popular one. Yve, on the other hand, went to the premiere, where he quickly realised that the film had nothing to do with his family, which infuriated him. Drugs clouded his judgment. He thought that a film about his family would be a good thing, when, in fact, it was done to mock them.

The Basque jaurerriak or se√±or√≠os (literally, the Basque lordships) were a series of feudal territories that came into existence in the Basque Country in the Middle Ages. The lordships were hereditary land titles over territories of variable size under the name of a lord or count. The title and lands were often recognized by kings to Basque chieftains. It is loosely related to the concept of manorialism as the king had to swear allegiance to the Foral law in exchange for military assistance from the Basque chiefs, who were considered sovereign over their own lands and people. The Basque se√±or√≠os generally conformed vassal states of larger kingdoms; most of them started as domains of the Kingdom of Pamplona (later Navarre) but were conquered and attached to the Kingdom of Castile by the 13th century. The Basque term jaurreria (pronounced ) means \\"the lord's country\\" and it is usually used to refer to these feudal territories. The feudal title confirmed considerable powers to the holder, which in other areas were directly controlled by the king. The Lord or Count was a sovereign judicial and military high authority, who ruled directly without referring to a king. The powers of the lord included the appointment of government and civil servants and collection of taxes, as well as the powers to sign external treaties, raise armies and wage wars. The largest and most important of the se√±or√≠os was the Lordship of Biscay, which comprised the entire territory of the present- day province of Biscay.  Se√±or√≠os   Lordship of Biscay  The coat of arms of the Castilian House of Haro, the bearers of the title of Se√±or√≠o de Vizcaya during the 11th and 14th century. The Lordship of Biscay was a feudal territory comprising the present-day province of Biscay. It was ruled by the Lord of Biscay. It was the largest and most powerful of the Basque se√±or√≠os, and acted as a semi-autonomous territory with its own naval ensign and international consulates from the 11th century until its dissolution in 1876. The Lordship was first a vassal state of the Kingdom of Pamplona, but starting in the 13th century it was conquered and later annexed by the Kingdom of Castile. The House of Haro were the bearers of the title after the Castilian conquest and until 1379, when John I of Castile inherited the title and lands. The Lordship was integrated by three constituent lands: * The Lur Laua or Tierra Llana (meaning \\"flat land\\"), referred to the non-fortified towns and villages of Biscay, which were organised in elizates. * The Enkarterri, a historical region west of the river Nervi√≥n. * The County of Durango, comprising a previously autonomous county who was eventually integrated into the Lordship.  Lordship of Gipuzkoa  A feudal territory comprising most of the present-day province of Gipuzkoa. It was annexed by Alfonso VIII of Castile to the Kingdom of Castile in the year 1200.  County of √Ålava  Tower-house of Varona, in √Ålava. The County of √Ålava comprised most of the present-day province of √Ålava from its consolidation in the 9th century until its dissolution in the year 1200 after being conquered by Alfonso VIII and annexed to the Kingdom of Castile. The county changed hands frequently, being controlled by the kingdoms of Asturias, Castile and Navarre at different times. The figure governing the County had the title of Count of √Ålava.  Lordship of O√±ate  The smallest of the Basque se√±or√≠os, it comprised the territory surrounding the fortified city of O√±ati, in present-day Gipuzkoa. The lordship was originally awarded by the Navarrese monarchs to the members of the House of Guevara, who all originated in the village with the same name in √Ålava. As such, the lordship had strong links with the Kingdom of Pamplona, but also with the County of √Ålava. The lordship was conquered by Castile circa the year 1200, but the titles were ratified by the Catholic Monarchs to the Guevara family in the year 1481. The lordship was dissolved in 1845, when O√±ati was finally integrated into the province of Gipuzkoa. References *Kasper, M.

It staffs the ticket window which is equipped with a Midori no Madoguchi facility. See images of tickets sold. Adjacent stations History The private Kyushu Railway, had opened a track from to by 5 May 1895, and thereafter expanding southwards in phases, as part of the construction of a line to Nagasaki. Separately, a track was laid from (then known as Nagasaki) north to Nagayo, which opened on 22 July 1897 as the terminus. On 27 November 1898, Nagayo became a through-station when a link up was made with the track from Tosu which had expanded south to ≈åmura. When the Kyushu Railway was nationalized on 1 July 1907, Japanese Government Railways (JGR) took over control of the station. On 12 October 1909, track from Tosu through Haiki, ≈åmura, Nagayo to Nagasaki was designated the Nagasaki Main Line. On 2 October 1972, a shorter inland bypass route was opened between through to Urakami was opened, which became known as the new line or Ichinuno branch of the Nagasaki Main Line. The section serving Nagayo became known as the old line or the Nagayo branch. With the privatization of Japanese National Railways (JNR), the successor of JGR, on 1 April 1987, control of the station passed to JR Kyushu. Passenger statistics In fiscal 2016, the station was used by an average of 1,943 passengers daily (boarding passengers only), and it ranked 94th among the busiest stations of JR Kyushu.

It first aired on television on May 27, 2008. The episode name is a Latin term (it translates as \\"without which [there is] nothing\\") referring to something essential that cannot be done without. The survivor count shown in the title sequence is 39,674. Plot The episode continues from the previous episode \\"Guess What's Coming to Dinner?\\" with the injured Cylon Natalie being taken to the sickbay. Despite Doctor Cottle's best efforts, Natalie's wounds prove to be fatal. Natalie dies while projecting a forest for comfort. As a gesture of kindness, Doctor Cottle holds her hand as she dies as well. President Laura Roslin visits the Basestar accompanied by half of the pilots. After the hybrid is plugged in, the Basestar immediately jumps away to unknown coordinates. The Quorum must find a replacement for Roslin, who is assumed kidnapped. The Quorum can elect a temporary president, so Lee Adama solicits the help of a reluctant Romo Lampkin in choosing the best candidate. Admiral Adama questions Lt. Sharon \\"Athena\\" Agathon in his quarters regarding why she shot Natalie. Athena confesses to Adama about the visions she had of Natalie and Gaius Baltar taking away her half-human, half- Cylon child, Hera. She is sent to the brig. Admiral Adama must now both protect the fleet and find the rebel Basestar with Roslin and his troops on board. He orders Colonel Saul Tigh to interrogate Caprica-Six in the brig to try to get information from her about the Cylon hub. Tigh's interrogation/liaison is interrupted when a badly damaged missing Raptor jumps into contact range. The raptor's flight data recorder shows where its jump had originated. A raptor scouting mission to those coordinates finds the remains of a battle with a destroyed Cylon Basestar, Viper and what is assumed to be the hub. Adama does not believe the destroyed Basestar was the rebels' ship with Roslin on board, and he orders four Raptors to remain there in case it returns. Admiral Adama meets with Colonel Tigh in his cabin and confronts him with the information that he knows about Tigh's \\"meetings\\" with Caprica-Six in the brig with the cameras turned off. Adama reveals to Tigh that Caprica-Six is pregnant. Tigh, in shock, does not deny that he is the father; Adama accuses him of betrayal. Tigh in turn accuses Adama of risking the whole fleet by searching for Roslin. Angers explode and a short but brutal fight ensues between the two men, but the old friends soon stop and accept their unusual emotional predicaments. Adama remarks after the squabble, in which the model ship is broken, \\"Do you know how many times I have had to repair this thing?\\" All the names on the list of potential presidential candidates have been eliminated, but Lampkin realizes that there is only one person who could possibly replace Roslin, even if that person's name was not on the list. After finding Lee, Romo congratulates him on his successful candidacy, but Lee explains he was never a candidate. Lampkin does not listen and pulls a gun on him. Lampkin is distraught because he lost his wife during the attack on the colonies and does not believe humanity deserves to have a president who gives such hope as Lee would. Lee Adama convinces Lampkin that there is hope and that he will make a difference. Lee is sworn in as acting President. Admiral Adama will no longer risk his remaining pilots or the fleet in looking for Roslin, and hands over command of the Galactica to Tigh. The Admiral takes a Raptor and remains behind. While he waits, he reads the charred copy of Searider Falcon he'd given Roslin which was recovered from the damaged Raptor.

A keen birdwatcher from an early age, his parents bought him his first camera in his teens. Tipling was soon recording the birds in his local area. A largely self- taught wildlife photographer, Tipling came under the watchful eye of Roy Coles, the then warden of nearby Bough Beech Reservoir, a nature reserve in Kent. Tipling learned his craft largely by 'trial and error' and by training his eye, studying the work of various artist's who gave him his distinctive 'artistic' sense of composition. Between 1983 and 1994 he travelled throughout Britain following birdwatchers to photograph the rarities they were travelling to see. This gave him a good grounding in fieldcraft and ornithology. A taste for the rare and unseen, with an artist's sense of composition, was the result.Favourite Images selected by the RSPB Tipling's work was soon widely published in magazines such as British Birds, Birds Illustrated,Birds Illustrated VOLUME 2, ISSUE 1 Autumn 2004.

Themes and interests Bamboos by Xu Wei (Freer Gallery of Art) Wildlife is usually difficult to find, troublesome to approach and often impossible to capture, thus a knowledge of animal behaviour is a necessary skill in all great wildlife photography. The animal photographer needs above all to be able to predict actions. An ability to stalk animals is often a requirement. What makes Tipling's photographic work distinctive is his artistic sense of composition. His work is influenced by the Swedish painter Bruno Liljefors whose often brooding depictions of predator-prey action ‚Äì the hunts engaged between sea eagle and eider, goshawk and black grouse ‚Äì help to create their darkly primitive atmosphere. and by Robert Gillmor's strong graphic,. Tipling cites some of the great Eastern painters who practised Oriental ink painting which has its roots in calligraphy, as influential. Much of his work resonates with that sense of proportion achieved in the light, striking shapes of Xu Wei's work. A keen conservationist, Tipling is perhaps closer than others to witnessing the dangers birds in the wild face. In 1994 his article in the New Scientist alerted its readers to the declining state of the barn owl: Birds and People Tipling's latest project with author and naturalist Mark Cocker and natural history researcher Jonathan Elphick, is Birds and People. Birds and People website Birds and People is a ten-year-long collaboration between the publishers Random House and BirdLife International, to survey and document worldwide, the cultural significance of birds,Birdwatch Tipling's role within the Birds and People project, as the commissioned photographer and picture editor, is both to photograph and find images that illustrate the connection between man and bird as depicted in the stories recorded and covered by the project. Images will range from depictions of the birds themselves to pieces of art, objects such as ceramics, architecture and of course people. The Birds and People project involves an open internet forum, for individuals worldwide to document their reflections, experiences and stories about birds.

Biography Sillman was born in London in 1921. In 1924, the family moved to Pyramid Hill, Australia, where his father farmed. Due to severe drought they returned to England in 1934. He commenced his art studies in September 1935 at Blackheath School of Art. His tutor was James Woodford RA. As the art school was bombed during the Blitz of 1940, he was unable to take his final examination but he had already been accepted for the Royal College of Art and awarded a scholarship by the London County Council. He began his studies there in September 1940 at their wartime quarters in Ambleside before entering the army in April 1941. War service At first he served with the 423 Battery London Scottish Royal Artillery and was later transferred to train at the Royal Artillery counter-battery Survey at Larkhill. In late 1942, he was sent to Egypt and then to Tripoli to join the 3rd Survey Regiment of the Eighth Army group and took part in the invasion of Sicily at Syracuse and the invasion of Italy at Reggio Calabria. The regiment continued in action through Italy until the end of the war in 1945. They were in action at most of the major engagements, Isernia, the Sangro, Monte Cassino, the Gothic Line and the hills before Bologna for the final winter before the advance to Trieste (he was wounded at Rio Nero in November 1943). Long periods of boredom punctuated by moments of terror: \\"it was not all excitement, a lot of the time both sides sat staring at each other until someone started shelling\\". They were stationed at Ronchi dei Legionari near Monfalcone during the Trieste crisis. He received home leave in September 1945 and married Gillian Drake (1921‚Äì2007) who was serving with the Auxiliary Territorial Service. Before demobilisation in December 1946 he spent three months at the Accademia di Belle Arti in Florence under the Army Education Scheme. He returned to his studies at the Royal College of Art and completed his studies under Frank Dobson RA and John Skeaping RA. His wife, Gillian, continued her studies at the Central School of Art. Their daughter Caroline was born 15 September 1947. Art groups and commissions He was awarded his ARCA degree in 1949 and became a sculptor in London until late 1956. During this time he carried out various commissions, exhibited and taught part-time at the Borough Polytechnic (now London South Bank University) and South East Essex Technical College Art Schools. He spent a considerable amount of time drawing at the London Zoo, as the basis for animal sculptures. During this time he exhibited regularly at the Royal Academy, R.B.A., London Group, S.E.A. and other shows. In 1956 he was appointed Head of Sculpture at Nottingham College of Art (now part of Nottingham Trent University). During these freelance years he worked in wood, stone, terracotta and clay for bronze and ciment fondu. He also made small scale models for model soldier company Britains Ltd including the \\"Trojans Warriors\\" designed in 1957. He received his first commission for a coin from the Royal Mint in 1956 (for Bermuda) and became a Fellow of the Royal British Society of Sculptors in 1959. Power in Trust (1961) at Staythorpe Power Station near Nottingham In Nottingham, he continued with commissioned works (including in 1961 the six metre Power in Trust sculpture at Staythorpe Power Station near Nottingham) and exhibiting at the R.A. and other annual shows as well as coin and medal designing for various mints (The Royal Mint, Birmingham Mint, York (Birmingham) Mint, Metalimport, Sandhill Ltd, Danbury Mint USA, Franklin Mint USA, Glendinning USA, etc.) Over the years he designed numerous medals for Britain and abroad, and coins for some 30 countries. For Britain he designed the Scottish Commonwealth Games ¬£2 piece and the four most recent ¬£1 coin reverses. He became a committee member of the Midland Group of Artists, Nottingham, and a member of the Federation Internationale de la Medaille and exhibited with them overseas. When the Nottingham College of Art became part of Trent Polytechnic he became senior Lecturer in the Fine Art Department. Later he gave courses of lectures for the Art History Department and toward the last, before retirement, a course of studies in Tribal Arts. It was through his work in this area that he wrote and published several articles in journals, of an \\"Archaeological/Anthropological\\" nature. He retired from Trent Polytechnic in 1983 and moved from Collingham, Nottinghamshire to Eye, Suffolk, where he continued to design coins, medals and other sculpture.

She was the last private owner of Montpelier, the mansion and land estate of former United States President James Madison. At the time of her death, she bequeathed Montpelier to the National Trust for Historic Preservation and established an endowment for its maintenance; it had been designated a National Historic Landmark. During the National Trust's major restoration of the mansion in 2003‚Äì2008 to its design during the time of Madison's residency, it reduced the house from the 55-room structure developed by the du Pont family back to its original 22 rooms. Biography Marion was born in Wilmington, Delaware, the daughter of William du Pont and his second wife, Annie Rogers, the former wife of George Zinn, Sr. She had one sibling, William Jr., and a half-brother, George Zinn, Jr. She spent her childhood at Binfield, Berkshire, England. She was a great-granddaughter of Eleuth√®re Ir√©n√©e du Pont. Of French Huguenot descent, the Du Pont family usually spell the family name as \\"du Pont\\" in the French style. Both Marion and her brother, William duPont, Jr., chose to spell their surname conjoined. Marion grew up riding in the hunt country of Virginia and became an accomplished horsewoman. She became interested in racing as well and developed what became known as the Montpelier Stable. She owned and bred Thoroughbreds for both flat and steeplechase racing. In addition, she and her brother William developed a number of racing venues, including Delaware Park, which he designed in 1937 in Delaware;\\"History of Delaware Park\\", Official Website Fair Hill, home to the National Steeplechase Association Headquarters and its race course in Maryland, on more than 5,000 acres of land formerly owned by William duPont, Jr.;Fairhill NMRA , Official website and the Springdale Race Course, Camden, South Carolina, home of the Carolina Cup and the Colonial Cup races.\\"History of Montpelier Races\\", Montpelier Hunt Races website\\"Springdale Race Course\\", Carolina Cup Website In 1934, she and her brother William founded the Montpelier Steeplechase Hunt Races, held on the grounds of the estate.

She also owned the 25 acre Holly Hedge estate in Camden, South Carolina from 1944 until her death in 1983. This large antebellum home was built in 1835 and included a modern ten stall horse barn. She purchased the Springdale Race Course in Camden SC as well and also owned a large equine training facility there. Her legacy lives in Camden, SC with the annual steeplechase \\"Marion duPont Scott's Colonial Cup\\" that she founded in 1970. Scott Park adjacent to her previous training facility is a city park on land that she donated to the city. Battleship Road in Camden, SC is named after her famous horse. In 1976, she compiled and published her book \\"Montpelier-The Recollections of Marion duPont Scott,\\" with help from writer Gerald Strine.http://www.vetmed.vt.edu/emc/welcome/mds.asp Marion Scott had additions made to Montpelier for her own use, including wings that brought the total of rooms up to 55. At her death in 1983, Marion had bequeathed the estate, designated a National Historic Landmark, to the National Trust for Historic Preservation. Her father's will had said that if she were childless, the property would be inherited by her brother and his children. Her will included a provision for his children to sell or give their interests in the property to the National Trust or forfeit their share of a separate $3.1 million trust. In addition, she provided $10 million to the National Trust to buy the property and to establish an endowment. As her brother had died in 1965, his five children inherited Montpelier. Although two nephews sued the National Trust in an effort to break the will, they finally sold their interests in 1984.Marjorie Hunter (NY Times News Service), \\"James Madison's Montpelier to become museum:, Gainesville Sun], 18 November 1984 After the National Trust for Historic Preservation took over the property, it undertook a major restoration in the 2000s to return it to its design when occupied by James and Dolley Madison in the early 1800s. It reduced the size to the original 22 rooms and is trying to locate the original furnishings or goods of the same period.

Achievements Chen Yifei is a central figure in the development of Chinese oil painting. He is also considered one of China's most renowned contemporary artists. Although he was denounced for \\"capitalist behavior\\", Chen's work with oil painting earned him recognition from Chinese authorities. Chen soon became one of the leading painters of the Cultural Revolution. He was famous for his big Mao Zedong portraits and depiction of grand heroic events of the modern Chinese nation. After the Cultural Revolution, Chen became the forerunner of a new age in Chinese aesthetics, promoting a new sense of modernity and lifestyle in his paintings as well as in fashion, cinema and design. In his oil paintings Chen abandoned his uncritical glorification of the party to blend realistic technique and romanticism with Chinese subject matter, especially melancholic and lonely women in traditional dresses. His characteristic \\"Romantic Realism\\" paintings use dark and dense colors and convey a sense of richness and integrity. In 1980 he became one of the first artists from the People's Republic of China permitted to study art in the United States. Wally Findlay Galleries was the first gallery to grant Chen Yifei an exclusive contract. Chen Yifei enrolled at Hunter College and later found work as an art restorer. In 1983, before he attained his master's degree at Hunter, his solo exhibition at the Hammer Galleries was a great success. Later, he established as a contract artist for the Hammer Galleries. Chen returned to China and settled in Shanghai in 1990. He painted Impressionist landscapes of Tibet and his native Zhejiang Province. At the same time, he had also transformed himself into a style entrepreneur, creating fashion brands, decorating hotels and selling high-end clothing and chic home furnishings. He also supervised one of the country's biggest modeling agencies. Some critics said he turned increasingly commercial. In 2005, while working on a feature film, \\"Barber,\\" Chen fell ill and died. Biography Early life Chen was born in Ningbo of the coastal province of Zhejiang. Later, the Chen family moved to Shanghai and Chen began his studies of Russian artists and Socialist Realism. Early career Chen graduated from the High School for Art in Shanghai in 1964, then graduated from the Shanghai Training School of Art (also called the Shanghai College of Art) in 1965 and soon after began focusing almost exclusively on oil painting. Within a year, as the Cultural Revolution gained steam, Chen caught the attention of Communist officials for his propaganda works that frequently glorified soldiers of the Communist party and portrayed grand images of Mao Zedong. Chen was soon viewed as \\"one of the leading artists at the state-financed Shanghai Institute of Painting.\\" This is a sad chapter of Chen's career as he climbed up the ladder by painting political themes and glorifying political personnel like Mao. This pushed China's art back to stone ages which also diminished Chen's reputation as a modern artist. Those paintings are now a stigma of Chen for not being a pure spirited artist but someone who is just a tool of politial propaganda, a major taboo in the field of fine art. Barboza, David. \\"Chen Yifei, 59, Painter and Entrepreneur, Dies.\\" New York Times. 14 April 2005 As the Cultural Revolution ended in 1976, Chen continued making oil paintings, now shifting his focus to a more romantic and European style. Chen was considered \\"one of the first artists to bridge the gap between the art of the Cultural Revolution and Western contemporary art\\". In the 1970s, his profile rose due to his oil works. Chen began to attract the attention of Western buyers, including Armand Hammer (Chairman of the Occidental Petroleum Corporation in the United States), who purchased Chen's Hometown Recall as a gift for Deng Xiaoping. In 1980 Chen left his position as head of the Oil Painting Department of the Shanghai Painting Academy in China to explore the art scene of New York, being one of the first artists of the People's Republic of China allowed out of the state to study art in the USA.\\"Versatile artist Chen Yifei dies at 59.\\" Shenzhen Daily. 11 April 2005. Web.The Atlasphere: \\"The Art of Chen Yifei\\" Chen often told interviewers that he arrived in New York \\"with only $38 in his pocket\\" but still managed to catch the attention of gallery owners early after arrival. Although he was successful as an artist in China, he ventured to the United States, not to necessarily make his print on the art establishment, but to explore his own predilections of artistic style. The New York art scene offered him freedom to experiment and settle in a style that he could be comfortable with. Chen expressed \\"elat[ion] by the freedom to look at art\\" and explore his own boundaries He gained entrance at Hunter College in the US after he arrived and worked as an art restorer. By 1983, before graduating from Hunter College, Chen's solo exhibitions at the Hammer Galleries had promoted his fame to where he later signed a contract to paint for Hammer Galleries. Chen then graduated from Hunter College in 1984 with a Master's in Art. Career In 1990, Chen returned to China, settling in Shanghai. Critics of Chen's work say that this time period marked when Chen became a more commercial artist. The early 1990s denoted a point when Chen's art was selling for record breaking prices in big name galleries. In the early 1990s, Chen also began building his name as businessman, investing in a magazine called the \\"Shanghai Tatler,\\" his Layefe fashion brands and later home design brands, and a restaurant in Xintiandi. Chen also began his film production career in 1993. In 1994, Chen started his long standing friendship and partnership with Gilbert Lloyd of the Marlborough Fine Art gallery who acted as his art-dealer until his death. In the last part of Chen's life, he devoted his time increasingly to acting as a \\"style entrepreneur\\" working as modeling agent, fashion designer and decorator as well as focusing on his film productions. Art Style and content Chen worked primarily in oil painting that portrayed his sense of romanticism and realism combined. His works frequently featured beautiful women in traditional Chinese attire working with musical instruments or other romanticized objects. There are many examples of this brand of painting including Young Cellists (1984) and Two Women and Fan (2003). Other works featuring Chinese women in traditional clothing include Beauty (Blue/Red) (1998), Beauty with Fan (2002), Group of Beauties with Fans (2004), Seated Beauty with Fan (1998), and Reclining Beauty (1997)ArtNet.com- Chen Yifei Biography The realism of Chen's works often evokes a photographic or cinematic feeling, inspired by the framing, lighting and positioning of the paintings. In addition to painting the female form, some of Chen's earlier works were often more impressionistic landscape paintings done in his own style, such as his piece Shadow from 1983 in which a scene of a canal in absence of human life is painted in muted tones. Chen first received inspiration for this works when he travelled to Europe in the summer of 1982 and explored the canals, noting similarity in the ambience between the East and West. He later returned to Zhejiang and explored, what he considered, \\"Venice of the East\\" for more inspiration.Jasmine Fine Art: The cultural nostalgia of Chen Yifei His landscapes often featured similar scenes of canals inspired by the canals of Venice, Italy as well as the canals of his hometown in Zhejiang province. \\"Official\\" art Chen's artistic career began soon after graduating from the Shanghai College of Art when his realistic style of oil painting caught the attention of Communist officials. Chen painted many famous portraits of Mao in heroic, glorified positions. One of these works, Seizing of the Presidential Palace (1977) received great favor in the Communist party, earning a place in the great halls around China. The picture is an historical epic depiction of a group of soldiers raising a red flag, representative of the history of the Revolution. His work Eulogy of the Yellow River, completed in 1972, is still considered one of his most commercially successful works, featuring his singular techniques in expressive brushstrokes that create a realistic view of a soldier standing above a yellow-toned valley, turned to face the viewer. The work was originally inspired by a poem (written by Guang Weiran) and a song (composed by Xian Xinghai). The work was first presented to the public in 1977 at the United Armies Art Exhibition when Chen was 25 years old.\\" Eulogy of the Yellow River, Chen Yifei's Reputation-Founding Work, Breaks Records at RMB 40.32 Million.\\" The revelation of this work marked a pivotal point in Chen's artistic career, propelling his art into further success in the future. In 2007, two years after the artist's death, Eulogy of the Yellow River sold at The China Guardian 2007 Spring Auction of Oil Painting and Sculptures for a record high of RMB 40.28 million, breaking both Chen's previous world record high sale and the national record for Chinese oil paintings. In 1979, Chen painted Looking at History from My Space, a piece that critics consider of Chen's work consider \\"one of his most original works\\". The painting features the artist standing in front of a large mural of painted events from the 1910s and 1920s, symbolically representing the artist trying to distance himself from the history, to examine his own place in history. Realism Along with his predilection for painting women, Chen painted a series of realistic works featuring people of Tibet; the series was called \\"Tibet.\\" To gather intelligence and insight on the people and customs of Tibet, Chen spent some time in the 1980s exploring Jiangnan. The works that followed his excursion held true to his highly realistic brand of painting, but travelled away from only painting the most beautiful forms of life. His \\"Tibet\\" works feature the tanned and coarse Tibetan people with no pretense of activity and muted expressions. One of the most famous works from this series was called Upland Wind (sometimes called Wind of Mountain Village) and was painted in 1994. The painting features a family of Tibetan travelers, heavily clothed and layered (to convey a sense of coldness) in traditional Tibetan styles. The painting was initially auctioned at the China Guardian 1994 Autumn Auctions, selling for a record high price of 2.86 million Yuan. At the time, this was a record for Chinese oil paintings. Again in May 2011 the painting was auctioned off for 81.65 million Yuan, beating the record again for highest selling oil painting as well as beating his own record for highest selling work.China.org: Chen Yifei painting sells for record high Acclaim and criticism His works considered a unique combination of both Western and Eastern influences. Chen's style combines the realism associated with European art styles, with Eastern subject matter and themes close to the artist's history. One such example of this unique blend is his painting Poppy which derives its content from a Tang dynasty song about a woman who solemnly questions her fate. The painting features a Chinese woman in traditional Chinese garb, yet the style of painting coupled with her posture are more reminiscent of ancient Greek artworks than Tang dynasty works. His Eastern-Western fusion of artistic styles is apparent in another of his famous paintings called Soiree, which depicts Chinese musicians in traditional Chinese apparel, embodying an obvious Eastern theme, but the atmosphere of the painting aligns more with the Western ideal of \\"carpe diem\\". Critics of Chen's work comment that his works lack and edge possibly due to his commercialization. Chen, however, viewed his entrepreneurship and businessman-like approach to art as an extension of what he truly loved: beauty. In answering a question regarding his work, Chen is quoted to have said: \\"I love paintings, clothing and films because they are all beautiful things\\".Rappolt, Mark. \\"Chen Yifei: Memorial Exhibition at Marlborough Fine Art.\\" Modern Painters.

The film was about the 1930s in Shanghai. In 2002 Chen began preparations for his film \\"Barber\\" (also known as \\"The Music Box\\"). The production of the film halted in 2003 when Chen reported to have issues with one of the leading actors, Jiang Wen. The film began production in February 2003 when Chen Kun was brought in to replace Jiang Wen as a leading actor. Filming for \\"Barber\\" was still in progress when Chen became ill and died of a gastric haemorrhage in April 2005. There have been recurring plans to finish the film. Fashion and home design Chen's fashion brand Layefe (a play on his first name) launched in 1998, followed in 2000 by the emergence of Layefe Home, his designer homeware line. The late artist's original intent in producing and designing a fashion line was to provide affordable but beautiful clothing to his home country. After spending time out of the country and gaining more perspective for his own personal tastes in beauty, Chen noticed a lack of style in his homeland and vouched to remedy the problem by creating a clothing line that embodied his own sense of Western-Eastern fusion. With Layefe he aimed to \\"provide beautiful and affordable clothing for Chinese women\\"Tsui, Christine. China Fashion: Conversations with Designers. Berg, 15 February 2010. 190. Print.

He often appeared in local tabloids if not for his accomplishments as an artist and businessman, then for gossip about his alleged \\"affairs with models\\" Chen has two sons; one, Chen Lin, from his first marriage and another from his second marriage.
