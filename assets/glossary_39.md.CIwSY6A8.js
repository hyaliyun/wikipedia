The tunnel was completed in 1888 for the Minnesota and Northwestern Railroad, a predecessor to the Chicago Great Western Railway (CGW). The tunnel was located on the CGW main line 152 miles (245 kilometers) west of Chicago in the isolated and hilly Driftless Area of extreme north- western Illinois. In 1972, four years after the Chicago Great Western was merged into the Chicago and North Western Railway (C&NW;), the CGW's largely redundant trackage in the area, including the Winston Tunnel, was abandoned. It was the third longest railroad tunnel in Illinois at 2,493 feet (760 m). Two longer (still active) tunnels are located on the Canadian National (ex- Illinois Central) Edgewood Cutoff Line, the longest being Tunnel #2 near Abbot, Illinois which is 6,994 feet (2,132 m) long. History The newly constructed Minnesota and Northwestern Railroad across northern Illinois used trackage rights on the Illinois Central Railroad between Dubuque, Iowa and Stockton, Illinois in 1886 before construction on its own line through the isolated wilderness could commence. Engineers quickly realized that a tunnel would need to be constructed in order to traverse the rugged landscape. The Sheppard, Winston and Company (for which the tunnel would be named) and more than 350 laborers worked by hand, digging through the silty and unstable shale for nine months starting in the spring of 1887. The work was both strenuous and dangerous, and at least one worker, a thirty-two-year-old Finnish immigrant named John Hill, was killed.Grant, H. Roger. The Corn Belt Route: A History of the Chicago Great Western Railroad Company, page 14-5. Northern Illinois University Press (DeKalb, Illinois), 1984. When complete, the total cost of the tunnel, $600,000, had exceeded expectations.Maggie Schweihs, \\"Essence of Winston Tunnel Lingers\\", The Galenian, Fall/Winter 2006-2007, p. 60. The tunnel proved to be a constant nuisance to the Chicago Great Western and its predecessors. Almost immediately, railroad engineers realized that the unstable nature of shale through which the tunnel was bored, ground water seepage, and the isolated location of the tunnel meant repairs would be frequent and costly. The tunnel was originally braced by wooden beams when it opened to rail traffic in January 1888, but these eventually proved inadequate, and were replaced in 1902 by brick and reinforced concrete. Constant deterioration of the supports meant that large-scale reconstruction of the tunnel was needed in 1912, 1918, 1944 and 1947.Finch, C. W. The CGW Winston Tunnel and its Ghost, p. 28-9 and 52-3. Bireline Company (Newell, Iowa), 1985. The bore was also improperly ventilated at first. A shaft sunk into the top of the tunnel failed to provide enough fresh air, and the crews of the steam engines would often complain of the intense heat and smoke due to the poor air circulation. Piecemeal solutions failed to work, and by 1912 the railroad was forced to install a huge fan, powered by a diesel motor and staffed by operators day and night, to ventilate the tunnel. The fanhouse, constructed by 1916, was abandoned by the CGW with the acquisition of diesel locomotives by 1947.Finch, p. 25-6; Schweihs, p. 62. When the Chicago Great Western was federalized during World War I, a contingent of Illinois National Guardsmen were assigned to protect the tunnel.Grant, page 89. The operating nightmares of the tunnel, not to mention the millions of dollars the CGW spent to keep it open, forced the railroad's management to consider many schemes to rid themselves of the burden. In 1909, 1951 and again in 1964 (the same year the North Western and Great Western announced their intentions to merge) the CGW sought engineering proposals to reroute their trackage around the bore, to daylight the tunnel, or to completely rebuild and improve it. To the often cash-strapped Great Western, however, all these plans proved far too expensive.Finch, p. 29-31. In the end, the 1968 merger with the Chicago and North Western (C&NW;) sealed the Winston Tunnel's fate. The Great Western's main line through northern Illinois closely paralleled the North Western's own line, but through less densely populated and less commercially active areas. The steep grades of the line and the obvious financial burden of the Winston Tunnel also played a role in the decision to completely abandon the Great Western's trackage in the area. The C&NW; operated its last train through the tunnel in 1971. Scrappers pulled up the tracks the following year. Upon abandonment, the C&NW; placed chain-link fences over each bore of the tunnel to keep squatters and other trespassers out.Huddleston, Jerry. \\"The Hole in Stickney's Pocketbook: CGW's Winston Tunnel\\" A 1973 attempt to turn the right- of-way through Jo Daviess County, including the Winston Tunnel, into a rail trail, failed when ownership of the land reverted to nearby property owners.Schweihs, p. 62 Present day The Winston Tunnel still exists in a very deteriorated condition. Nature has reclaimed the right-of-way; the fan house, unused since the 1940s and damaged by the elements, was demolished in early 2007, and the eastern bore, located on private property, has been almost completely sealed with earth. The western half was purchased by the Illinois Department of Natural Resources as a \\"satellite area\\" of Apple River Canyon State Park. The DNR installed a new steel gate to replace the chain-link fence covering the western bore, and is developing the area with nature trails and other improvements. the tunnel is off-limits to public visitation as it is unsafe, due both to rattlesnakes and the ever-present danger of further collapse.

Dubai Marina is an artificial canal city, built along a stretch of Persian Gulf shoreline. As of 2016, it has a population of 45,395. When the entire development is complete, it will accommodate more than 120,000 people in residential towers and villas. It is located on Interchange 5 between Jebel Ali Port and the area which hosts Dubai Internet City, Dubai Media City, and the American University in Dubai. The first phase of this project has been completed. Dubai Marina was inspired by the Concord Pacific Place development along False Creek in Vancouver, BC, Canada.Brody, Trevor (2006). False Creek, Dubai. There have been many instances of marine wildlife (especially whales and sharks) entering the marina, because of its proximity to the open sea. Development An Aerial view of Dubai Marina Towers, with Jumeirah Lake Towers in the background. In order to create the man-made marina, the developers brought the waters of the Persian Gulf into the site of Dubai marina, creating a new waterfront. There is a large central waterway, excavated from the desert and running the length of the 3 km site. More than 12% of the total land area on the site has been given over to this central public space. Although much of this area is occupied by the marina water surface, it also includes almost 8 km of landscaped public walkways. The marina is entirely man-made and has been developed by the real estate development firm Emaar Properties of the United Arab Emirates and designed by HOK Canada. Upon completion, it is claimed to be the world's largest man-made marina. The current largest man-made marina in the world is Marina del Rey in California, United States. There is a publicly accessible foreshoreway around the marina and some sections of public oceanway along the beach with views to Palm Jumeriah. Its largest development is the Jumeirah Beach Residence. Dubai Marina opened doors to its only mosque Masjid Al Rahim in October 2013, which is situated in the southern end of the Marina. =Phase I= The first phase of Dubai Marina covers , which includes six freehold apartment buildings, the Dubai Marina Towers.

This family has few members compared to most rodent families, with only nine known living species. They resemble chinchillas in appearance, with a similar soft fur and silvery-grey color, but have a body structure more like a short-tailed rat. They are social, tunnel-dwelling animals, and live in the Andes Mountains of South America. They are probably herbivorous, although this is not clear. They can be described as medium-sized. Stiff hairs project over the three middle digits of the rear feet. Their massive skulls narrow in the facial areas.Allaby, Michael. The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Zoology. pg 1.

Definition  The expression is most easily illustrated by a cladogram: Taxon A and taxon B are sister groups to each other. Taxa A and B, together with any other extant or extinct descendants of their most recent common ancestor (MRCA), form a monophyletic group, the clade AB. Clade AB and taxon C are also sister groups. Taxa A, B, and C, together with all other descendants of their MRCA form the clade ABC. The whole clade ABC is itself a subtree of a larger tree which offers yet more sister group relationships, both among the leaves and among larger, more deeply rooted clades. The tree structure shown connects through its root to the rest of the universal tree of life. In cladistic standards, taxa A, B, and C may represent specimens, species, genera, or any other taxonomic units. If A and B are at the same taxonomic level, terminology such as sister species or sister genera can be used.  Example  A Dinosauria phylogeny including two extant taxa: birds (Theropoda) and crocodiles (Suchia). The term \\"sister group\\" is used in phylogenetic analysis, and only groups identified in the analysis are labeled as sister groups. An example is in birds, whose sister group is commonly cited as the crocodiles, but that is true only when dealing with extant taxa. The bird family tree is rooted in the dinosaurs, and there were a number of extinct groups branching off of dinosaurs before coming to the last common ancestor of birds and crocodiles. Thus, the term sister group must be seen as a relative term, with the caveat that the sister group is the closest relative only among the groups/species/specimens that are included in the analysis.

The films were created by studio executive Hal Roach, who was best known as the man behind the comedy duo Laurel and Hardy. The series was produced in various formats from 1922 to 1944 and is noted for showing children behaving in a relatively natural way. Roach and original director Robert F. McGowan worked to film the unaffected, raw nuances apparent in regular children rather than have them imitate adult acting styles. The series broke new ground by portraying white and black children interacting as equals.Maltin, Leonard (1994). The Little Rascals: Remastered and Uncut, vol. 22, introduction. Videorecording. New York: Cabin Fever Entertainment/Hallmark Entertainment. The franchise began in 1922 as a series of silent short subjects produced by the Roach studio and released by Path√© Exchange. Roach changed distributors from Path√© to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) in 1927, and the series entered its most popular period after converting to sound in 1929. Production continued at the Roach studio until 1938, when the studio's Our Gang production unit was sold to MGM, which produced the comedies until 1944. Across 220 short films and a feature-film spin-off, General Spanky, the Our Gang series featured over 41 child actors as regular members of cast. As MGM retained the rights to the Our Gang trademark following their purchase of the production rights, some of the Roach-produced films were re-released to theaters and syndicated for television under the title The Little Rascals. Roach's The Little Rascals package (currently owned by CBS Television Distribution through King World Productions) and MGM's Our Gang package (currently owned by Turner Entertainment and distributed by Warner Bros.) have since remained in syndication. New productions based on the shorts have been made over the years, including a 1994 feature film, The Little Rascals, released by Universal Pictures. Series overview Unlike many motion pictures featuring children and based in fantasy, producer/creator Hal Roach rooted Our Gang in real life: most of the children were poor, and the gang was often at odds with snobbish \\"rich kids,\\" officious adults, parents, and other such adversaries. =Directorial approach= Senior director Robert F. McGowan helmed most of the Our Gang shorts until 1933, assisted by his nephew Anthony Mack. McGowan worked to develop a style that allowed the children to be as natural as possible, downplaying the importance of the filmmaking equipment. Scripts were written for the shorts by the Hal Roach comedy writing staff, which included at various times Leo McCarey, Frank Capra, Walter Lantz, and Frank Tashlin, among others.Maltin and Bann. The Little Rascals: The Life & Times of Our Gang. pp. 1, 128, 134, 172. The children, some too young to read, rarely saw the scripts; instead, McGowan would explain the scene to be filmed to each child immediately before it was shot, directing the children using a megaphone and encouraging improvisation. When sound came in at the end of the 1920s, McGowan modified his approach slightly, but scripts were not adhered to until McGowan left the series. Later Our Gang directors, such as Gus Meins and Gordon Douglas, streamlined the approach to McGowan's methods to meet the demands of the increasingly sophisticated movie industry of the mid-to-late 1930s. Douglas, in particular, had to streamline his films, as he directed Our Gang after Roach halved the running times of the shorts from two reels (20 minutes) to one reel (10 minutes). =Finding and replacing the cast= As children became too old for the series, they were replaced by new children, usually from the Los Angeles area. Eventually Our Gang talent scouting employed large-scale national contests in which thousands of children tried out for an open role. For example, Norman Chaney (\\"Chubby\\"), Matthew Beard (\\"Stymie\\"), and Billie Thomas (\\"Buckwheat\\") all won contests to become members of the gang: Chaney replaced Joe Cobb, Beard replaced Allen Hoskins (\\"Farina\\"), and Thomas replaced Beard.Maltin & Bann, pp. 254‚Äì255.Maltin & Bann, pp. 259‚Äì260.Maltin & Bann, pp. 267‚Äì268. Even when there was no talent search, the studio was bombarded by requests from parents who were sure their children were perfect for the series. Among them were the future child stars Mickey Rooney and Shirley Temple, neither of whom made it past the audition.Maltin & Bann, pp. 6‚Äì7. = Minority cast members = Original theatrical poster for the Our Gang comedy Baby Brother, in which Allen \\"Farina\\" Hoskins (center) paints a black baby with white shoe polish so that he can sell him to a lonely rich boy, Joe Cobb (right), as a baby brother The Our Gang series is notable for being one of the first in cinema history in which Black Americans and White Americans were portrayed as equals. The four black child actors who held main roles in the series were Ernie Morrison, Allen Hoskins, Matthew Beard and Billie Thomas. Ernie Morrison was, in fact, the first black actor signed to a long-term contract in Hollywood historyMaltin & Bann, p. 243. and the first major black star in Hollywood history.. \\"[The] interesting thing is the first real kind of black American star in Hollywood was a [child actor]. His name was Ernest Morrison, whose stage name was \\"Sunshine Sammy.\\" He worked with Harold Lloyd in the early \\"Our Gang\\" series. He was very well known in the black community in Los Angeles and much admired.\\" The African-American characters have often been criticized as racial stereotypes. The Black children spoke (or were indicated as speaking via text titles in the case of the silent entries) in a stereotypical Negro dialect, and several controversial gags revolved directly around their skin color: Matthew Beard's Stymie character sweating jet-black ink, This scene appears in the 1932 short Birthday Blues. Billie Thomas' Buckwheat character being given fake \\"white measles\\" instead of dark ones and supposedly turned into a monkey,Maltin & Bann, p. 180-181. This situation forms part of the plot of the 1937 short Three Smart Boys. and so forth. One early Our Gang short, Lodge Night (1924), short revolves around the kids forming a parody club based on the Ku Klux Klan (though the Black children are still allowed to join). In their adult years, actors Morrison, Beard, and Thomas defended the series, arguing that the white characters in the series were similarly stereotyped: the \\"freckle-faced kid\\", the \\"fat kid\\", the \\"neighborhood bully\\", the \\"pretty blond girl\\", and the \\"mischievous toddler\\". In an interview on Tom Snyder's The Tomorrow Show in 1974, Matthew Beard said of his time in the series that \\"I feel it was great. Some of the lines I had to say I didn't like, but I never look at it like that. I just try to look at it as mostly a fun thing. We were just a group of kids who were having fun.\\" In a separate interview, Ernie Morrison stated, \\"When it came to race, Hal Roach was color-blind.\\"Maltin & Bann, p. 245. Despite the stereotyping and racial gags, Our Gang's integrated cast caused it to be disliked by certain theater owners in the southern United States. Early in existence of Our Gang, these theater owners complained to Path√© that Morisson and Hoskins had too much screen time and their prominence in the shorts would offend white audiences. A later Our Gang spin-off film, Curley (1947), was banned by the Memphis, Tennessee censor board for showing black and white children in school together, a characteristic common to even the earlier shorts. Other minorities, including Asian Americans Sing Joy, Allen Tong (also known as Alan Dong), and Edward Soo Hoo; and Italian American actor Mickey Gubitosi (later known as Robert Blake), were depicted in the series with varying levels of stereotyping.Maltin & Bann, p. 212. History Left to right: Ernie \\"Sunshine Sammy\\" Morrison, Andy Samuel, Allen \\"Farina\\" Hoskins, Mickey Daniels and Joe Cobb in a 1923 still from one of the earliest Our Gang comedies =1922‚Äì1925: Early years= According to Roach, the idea for Our Gang came to him in 1921, when he was auditioning a child actress to appear in a film. The girl was, in his opinion, overly made up and overly rehearsed, and Roach waited for the audition to be over. After the girl and her mother left the office, Roach looked out of his window to a lumberyard across the street, where he saw some children having an argument. The children had all taken sticks from the lumberyard to play with, but the smallest child had the biggest stick, and the others were trying to force him to give it to the biggest child. After realizing that he had been watching the children bicker for 15 minutes, Roach thought a short film series about children just being themselves might be a success.Maltin & Bann, p. 9. Our Gang also had its roots in an aborted Roach short-subject series revolving around the adventures of a black boy called \\"Sunshine Sammy\\", played by Ernie Morrison. Theater owners then were wary of booking shorts focused on a black boy, and the series ended after just one entry, The Pickaninny, was produced. Morrison's \\"Sunshine Sammy\\" instead became one of the foci of the new Our Gang series. Under the supervision of Charley Chase, work began on the first two-reel shorts in the new \\"kids-and-pets\\" series, to be called Hal Roach's Rascals, later that year. Director Fred C. Newmeyer helmed the first pilot film, entitled Our Gang, but Roach scrapped Newmeyer's work and had former fireman Robert F. McGowan reshoot the short. Roach tested it at several theaters around Hollywood. The attendees were very receptive, and the press clamored for \\"lots more of those 'Our Gang' comedies.\\" The colloquial usage of the term Our Gang led to its becoming the series' second (yet more popular) official title, with the title cards reading \\"Our Gang Comedies: Hal Roach presents His Rascals in...\\"Maltin & Bann, p. ix. The series was officially called both Our Gang and Hal Roach's Rascals until 1932, when Our Gang became the sole title of the series. The first cast of Our Gang was recruited primarily of children recommended to Roach by studio employees, with the exception of Ernie Morrison, under contract to Roach. The other Our Gang recruits included Roach photographer Gene Kornman's daughter Mary Kornman, their friends' son Mickey Daniels, and family friends Allen Hoskins, Jack Davis, Jackie Condon, and Joe Cobb. Most early shorts were filmed outdoors and on location and featured a menagerie of animal characters, such as Dinah the Mule. Roach's distributor Path√© released One Terrible Day, the fourth short produced for the series, as the first Our Gang short on September 10, 1922; the pilot Our Gang was not released until November 5. The Our Gang series was a success from the start, with the children's naturalism, the funny animal actors, and McGowan's direction making a successful combination. The shorts did well at the box office, and by the end of the decade the Our Gang children were pictured on numerous product endorsements. The biggest Our Gang stars then were Ernie Morrison as Sunshine Sammy, Mickey Daniels, Mary Kornman, and Allen Hoskins as little Farina, who eventually became the most popular member of the 1920s gangMaltin & Bann, p. 246. and the most popular black child star of the 1920s.Bogle, Donald (1973, rev. 2001). Toms, Coons, Mulattoes, Mammies & Bucks: An Interpretive History of Blacks in American Films (New York: Continuum), p. 21. . A reviewer wrote of the Farina character - depicted as female though played by a male child \\\\- in Photoplay: \\"The honors go to a very young lady of color, billed as 'Little Farina.' Scarcely two years old, she goes through each set like a wee, sombre shadow.\\" Daniels and Kornman were very popular and were often paired in Our Gang and a later teen version of the series called The Boy Friends, which Roach produced from 1930 to 1932. Other early Our Gang children were Eugene Jackson as Pineapple, Scooter Lowry, Andy Samuel, Johnny Downs, Winston and Weston Doty, and Jay R. Smith. =1926‚Äì1929: New faces and new distributors= After Ernie, Mickey and Mary left the series in the mid 1920s, the Our Gang series entered a transitional period. The stress of directing child actors forced Robert McGowan to take doctor-mandated sabbaticals for exhaustion, leaving his nephew Robert A. McGowan (credited as Anthony Mack) to direct many shorts in this period. The Mack-directed shorts are considered to be among the lesser entries in the series.Maltin & Bann, pp. 4‚Äì5. New faces included Bobby Hutchins as Wheezer, Harry Spear, Jean Darling and Mary Ann Jackson, while stalwart Farina served as the series' anchor. Also at this time, the Our Gang cast acquired an American Bulldog with a ring around one eye, originally named Pansy but soon known as Pete the Pup, the most famous Our Gang pet. In 1927, Roach ended his distribution arrangement with the Path√© company. He signed on to release future products through the newly formed Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, which released its first Our Gang comedy in September 1927. The move to MGM offered Roach larger budgets and the chance to have his films packaged with MGM features to the Loews Theatres chain. Some shorts around this time, particularly Spook Spoofing (1928, one of only two three-reelers in the Our Gang canon), contained extended scenes of the gang tormenting and teasing Farina, scenes which helped spur the claims of racism, which many other shorts did not warrant. These shorts marked the departure of Jackie Condon, who had been with the group from the beginning of the series. Jackie Cooper in the 1930 short School's Out =1929‚Äì1931: Entering the sound era= Starting in 1928, Our Gang comedies were distributed with phonographic discs that contained synchronized music-and-sound-effect tracks for the shorts. In spring 1929, the Roach sound stages were converted for sound recording, and Our Gang made its \\"all-talking\\" debut in April 1929 with the 25-minute film Small Talk. It took a year for McGowan and the gang to fully adjust to talking pictures, during which time they lost Joe Cobb, Jean Darling and Harry Spear and added Norman Chaney, Dorothy DeBorba, Matthew \\"Stymie\\" Beard, Donald Haines and Jackie Cooper. Cooper proved to be the personality the series had been missing since Mickey Daniels left and was featured prominently in three 1930/1931 Our Gang films: Teacher's Pet, School's Out, and Love Business. These three shorts explored Jackie Cooper's crush on the new schoolteacher Miss Crabtree, played by June Marlowe. Cooper soon won the lead role in Paramount's feature film Skippy, and Roach sold his contract to MGM in 1931. Other Our Gang members appearing in the early sound shorts included Buddy McDonald, Clifton Young, and Shirley Jean Rickert. Many also appeared in a group cameo appearance in the all-star comedy short The Stolen Jools (1931). Beginning with the short When the Wind Blows, in 1930 background music scores were added to the soundtracks of most of the Our Gang films. Initially, the music consisted of orchestral versions of then-popular tunes. Marvin Hatley had served as the music director of Hal Roach Studios since 1929, and RCA employee Leroy Shield joined the company as a part-time musical director in mid-1930. Hatley and Shield's jazz-influenced scores, first featured in Our Gang with 1930s Pups is Pups, became recognizable trademarks of Our Gang, Laurel and Hardy, and the other Roach series and films. Another 1930 short, Teacher's Pet, marked the first use of the Our Gang theme song, \\"Good Old Days\\", composed by Shield and featuring a notable saxophone solo. Shield and Hatley's scores supported Our Gang's on-screen action regularly through 1934, after which series entries with background scores became less frequent. In 1930, Roach began production on The Boy Friends, a short-subject series which was essentially a teenaged version of Our Gang. Featuring Our Gang alumni Mickey Daniels and Mary Kornman among its cast, The Boy Friends was produced for two years, with fifteen installments in total. Jerry Tucker in their makeshift fire engine in the 1934 short Hi'-Neighbor! =1931‚Äì1933: Transition= Jackie Cooper left Our Gang in early 1931 at the cusp of another major shift in the lineup, as Farina Hoskins, Chubby Chaney, and Mary Ann Jackson all departed a few months afterward. Our Gang entered another transitional period, similar to that of the mid 1920s. Matthew Beard, Wheezer Hutchins, and Dorothy DeBorba carried the series during this period, aided by Sherwood Bailey and Kendall McComas, who would play Breezy Brisbane Unlike the mid-1920s period, McGowan sustained the quality of the series with the help of the several regular cast members and the Roach writing staff. Many of these shorts include early appearances of Jerry Tucker and Wally Albright, who later became series regulars. New Roach discovery George McFarland joined the gang as Spanky late in 1931 at the age of three and, excepting a brief hiatus during the summer of 1938, remained an Our Gang actor for eleven years. At first appearing as the tag-along toddler of the group, and later finding an accomplice in Scotty Beckett in 1934, Spanky quickly became Our Gangs biggest child star. He won parts in a number of outside features, appeared in many of the now-numerous Our Gang product endorsements and spin-off merchandise items, and popularized the expressions \\"Okey-dokey!\\" and \\"Okey-doke!\\"Maltin & Bann, p. 262. Dickie Moore, a veteran child actor, joined in the middle of 1932 and remained with the series for one year. Other members in these years included Mary Ann Jackson's brother Dickie Jackson, John \\"Uh-huh\\" Collum, and Tommy Bond. Upon Dickie Moore's departure in mid 1933, long-term Our Gang members such as Wheezer (who had been with Our Gang since the late Path√© silents period) and Dorothy left the series as well. =1933‚Äì1936: New directions= Robert McGowan, burned out from the stress of working with the child actors, had as early as 1931 attempted to resign from his position as Our Gang producer/director. Lacking a replacement, Hal Roach persuaded him to stay on for another year. At the start of the 1933‚Äì34 season, the Our Gang series format was significantly altered to accommodate McGowan and persuade him to stay another year. The first two entries of the season in fall 1933, Bedtime Worries and Wild Poses (which featured a cameo by Laurel and Hardy), focused on Spanky and his hapless parents, portrayed by Gay Seabrook and Emerson Treacy, in a family-oriented situation comedy format similar to the style later popular on television. A smaller cast of Our Gang kids‚ÄîMatthew Beard, Tommy Bond, Jerry Tucker, and Georgie Billings‚Äîwere featured in supporting roles with reduced screen time. An unsatisfied McGowan abruptly left after Wild Poses. Coupled with a brief suspension in McFarland's work permit,Maltin & Bann, p. 119. See the article on Hi-Neighbor! (1934) for more details. Our Gang went into a four-month hiatus, during which the series was revised to a format similar to its original style and German-born Gus Meins was hired as the new series director.Ward, Richard Lewis (2005). A History of Hal Roach Studios. Carbondale, IL: Southern Illinois University Press. Pg. 85‚Äì86. . Hi-Neighbor!, released in March 1934, ended the hiatus and was the first series entry directed by Meins, a veteran of the once-competing Buster Brown short subject series. Gordon Douglas served as Meins's assistant director, and Fred Newmeyer alternated directorial duties with Meins for a handful of shorts. Meins's Our Gang shorts were less improvisational than McGowan's and featured a heavier reliance on dialogue.Maltin & Bann, p. 140. McGowan returned two years later to direct his Our Gang swan song, Divot Diggers, released in 1936. Retaining McFarland, Matthew Beard, Tommy Bond, and Jerry Tucker, the revised series added Scotty Beckett, Wally Albright, and Billie Thomas, who soon began playing the character of Stymie's sister \\"Buckwheat,\\" though Thomas was a male. Semi-regular actors, such as Jackie Lynn Taylor, Marianne Edwards, and Leonard Kibrick as the neighborhood bully, joined the series at this time. Tommy Bond and Wally Albright left in the middle of 1934; Jackie Lynn Taylor and Marianne Edwards would depart by 1935. Early in 1935, new cast members Carl Switzer and his brother Harold joined Our Gang after impressing Roach with an impromptu musical performance at the studio commissary. While Harold would eventually be relegated to the role of a background player, Carl, nicknamed \\"Alfalfa,\\" eventually replaced Scotty Beckett as Spanky's sidekick. Matthew Beard as Stymie left the cast soon after, and the Buckwheat character morphed subtly into a male. That same year, Darla Hood, Patsy May, and Eugene Lee as Porky joined the gang. Scotty Beckett departed for a career in features (he returned in 1939 for two shorts, Cousin Wilbur and Dog Daze). =The final Roach years= Our Gang was very successful during the 1920s and the early 1930s. However, by 1934, many movie theater owners were increasingly dropping two-reel (20-minute) comedies like Our Gang and the Laurel & Hardy series from their bills and running double feature programs instead. The Laurel & Hardy series went from film shorts to features exclusively in mid 1935. By 1936, Hal Roach began debating plans to discontinue Our Gang until Louis B. Mayer, head of Roach's distributor MGM, persuaded Roach to keep the popular series in production.Maltin & Bann, pp. 169‚Äì170. Roach agreed, producing shorter, one-reel Our Gang comedies (ten minutes in length instead of twenty). The first one-reel Our Gang short, Bored of Education (1936), marked the Our Gang directorial debut of former assistant director Gordon Douglas and won the Academy Award for Best Short Subject (One Reel) in 1937. As part of the arrangement with MGM to continue Our Gang, Roach received the clearance to produce an Our Gang feature film, General Spanky, hoping that he might move the series to features as was done with Laurel & Hardy. Directed by Gordon Douglas and Fred Newmeyer, General Spanky featured characters Spanky, Buckwheat, and Alfalfa in a sentimental, Shirley Temple- esque story set during the American Civil War. The film focused more on the adult leads (Phillips Holmes and Rosina Lawrence) than the children and was a box office disappointment.Maltin & Bann, p. 175. No further Our Gang features were made. George McFarland, Darla Hood, and Carl Switzer in the \\"Club Spanky\\" dream sequence from the 1937 short Our Gang Follies of 1938. After years of gradual cast changes, the troupe standardized in 1936 with the move to one- reel shorts. Most casual fans of Our Gang are particularly familiar with the 1936‚Äì1939 incarnation of the cast: Spanky, Alfalfa, Darla, Buckwheat, and Porky, with recurring characters such as neighborhood bullies Butch and Woim and the bookworm Waldo. Tommy Bond, an off-and-on member of the gang since 1932, returned to the series as Butch beginning with the 1937 short Glove Taps. Sidney Kibrick, the younger brother of Leonard Kibrick, played Butch's crony, Woim. Glove Taps also featured the first appearance of Darwood Kaye as the bespectacled, foppish Waldo. In later shorts, both Butch and Waldo were portrayed as Alfalfa's rivals in his pursuit of Darla's affections. Other popular elements in these mid-to-late-1930s shorts include the \\"He-Man Woman Haters Club\\" from Hearts Are Thumps and Mail and Female (both 1937), the Laurel and Hardy-ish interaction between Alfalfa and Spanky, and the comic tag-along team of Porky and Buckwheat. Roach produced the final two-reel Our Gang short, a high-budget musical special entitled Our Gang Follies of 1938, in 1937 as a parody of MGM's Broadway Melody of 1938. In Follies of 1938, Alfalfa, who aspires to be an opera singer, falls asleep and dreams that his old pal Spanky has become the rich owner of a swanky Broadway nightclub where Darla and Buckwheat perform, making \\"hundreds and thousands of dollars.\\" As the profit margins continued to decline owing to double features,Maltin & Bann, p. 195. Roach could no longer afford to continue producing Our Gang. However, MGM did not want the series discontinued and agreed to take over production. On May 31, 1938, Roach sold MGM the Our Gang unit, including the rights to the name and the contracts for the actors and writers, for $25,000 (equal to $ today).Ward, Richard Lewis (2005). A History of Hal Roach Studios. Carbondale: Southern Illinois University Press. pp. 116, 225. . After delivering the Laurel and Hardy feature Block-Heads, Roach also ended his distribution contract with MGM, moving to United Artists and leaving the short-subjects business. The final Roach-produced short in the Our Gang series, Hide and Shriek, was his final short-subject production. =The MGM era= The Little Ranger was the first Our Gang short to be produced in-house at MGM. Gordon Douglas was loaned out from Hal Roach Studios to direct The Little Ranger and another early MGM short, Aladdin's Lantern, while MGM hired newcomer George Sidney as the permanent series director. Our Gang would be used by MGM as a training ground for future feature directors: Sidney, Edward Cahn and Cy Endfield all worked on Our Gang before moving on to features. Another director, Herbert Glazer, remained a second-unit director outside of his work on the series. Nearly all of the 52 MGM-produced Our Gangs were written by former Roach director Hal Law and former junior director Robert A. McGowan (also known as Anthony Mack, nephew of former senior Our Gang director Robert F. McGowan). Robert A. McGowan was credited for these shorts as \\"Robert McGowan\\"; as a result, moviegoers have been confused for decades about whether this Robert McGowan and the senior director of the same name at Roach were two separate people. The last few of the Roach comedies featured Alfalfa Switzer as the lead character; Spanky McFarland had departed from the series just before its sale to MGM. Casting his replacement was delayed until after the move to MGM, at which point MGM rehired McFarland. In 1939, Mickey Gubitosi (later known by the stage name of Robert Blake) replaced Eugene \\"Porky\\" Lee, who had matured too quickly.Maltin & Bann, p. 211. Tommy Bond, Darwood Kaye, and Alfalfa Switzer all left the series in 1940, and Billy \\"Froggy\\" Laughlin (with his Popeye-esque trick voice) and Janet Burston were added to the cast. By the end of 1941, Darla Hood had departed from the series, and Spanky McFarland followed her within a year. Billie Thomas as Buckwheat remained in the cast until the end of the series as the sole holdover from the Roach era. Overall, the Our Gang films produced by MGM were not as well-received as the Roach-produced shorts had been, largely due to MGM's inexperience with the brand of slapstick comedy that Our Gang was famous for, and to MGM's insistence on keeping Alfalfa, Spanky, and Buckwheat in the series as they became teens.Maltin & Bann, p. 211. The MGM entries are considered by many film historians, and the Our Gang children themselves, to be lesser films than the Roach entries.Maltin & Bann, p. 202. The children's performances were criticized as stilted and stiff, their dialogue being recited instead of spoken naturally. Adult situations often drove the action, with each film often incorporating a moral, a civics lesson, or a patriotic theme. The series was given a permanent setting in the fictitious town of Greenpoint, and the mayhem caused by the Our Gang kids was toned down significantly. Exhibitors noticed the drop in quality, and often complained that the series was slipping. When six of the 13 shorts released between 1942 and 1943 sustained losses rather than turning profits,Maltin & Bann, pp. 235‚Äì236. Financial data for negative costs, revenue, and profits/losses are provided for all 52 MGM Our Gang shorts. MGM discontinued Our Gang. The final short was Dancing Romeo, which was released on April 29, 1944 (as an MGM Miniature, not an Our Gang comedy). Since 1937, Our Gang had been featured as a licensed comic strip in the UK comic The Dandy, drawn by Dudley D. Watkins. Starting in 1942, MGM licensed Our Gang to Dell Comics for the publication of Our Gang Comics, featuring the gang, Barney Bear, and Tom and Jerry. The strips in The Dandy ended three years after the demise of the Our Gang shorts, in 1947. Our Gang Comics outlasted the series by five years, changing its name to Tom and Jerry Comics in 1949. In 2006, Fantagraphics Books began issuing a series of volumes reprinting the Our Gang stories, mostly written and drawn by Pogo creator Walt Kelly. Later years and The Little Rascals revival =The Little Rascals television package= When Roach sold Our Gang to MGM, he retained the option to buy the rights to the Our Gang trademark, provided he produced no more children's comedies in the Our Gang vein. In the late 1940s, he created a new film property in the Our Gang mold and forfeited his right to buy back the name Our Gang to obtain permission to produce two Cinecolor featurettes, Curley and Who Killed Doc Robbin. Neither film was critically or financially successful, and Roach turned to re-releasing the original Our Gang comedies. In 1949, MGM sold Roach the back catalog of 1927‚Äì1938 Our Gang silent and talking shorts, while retaining the rights to the Our Gang name, the 52 Our Gang films it produced, and the feature General Spanky. Under the terms of the sale, Roach was required to remove the MGM Lion studio logo and all instances of the names or logos \\"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\\", \\"Loew's Incorporated\\", and Our Gang from the reissued film prints. Using a modified version of the series' original name, Roach repackaged 79 of the 80 sound Our Gang shorts as The Little Rascals. By all accounts available, none of the former child stars were ever paid a cent in residuals from this, despite the substantial profits netted. Monogram Pictures and its successor, Allied Artists, reissued the films to theaters beginning in 1950. Allied Artists' television department, Interstate Television, syndicated the films to TV in 1954. Under its new name, The Little Rascals enjoyed renewed popularity on television, and new Little Rascals comic books, toys, and other licensed merchandise were produced. MGM prepared to distribute its own Our Gang shorts to television in 1957, and offers for the shorts to stations began to be made in 1958. The two separate packages of Our Gang films competed with each other in syndication for three decades. Some stations bought both packages and played them alongside each other under the Little Rascals show banner. The television rights to the silent Path√© Our Gang comedies were sold to National Telepix and other distributors, who distributed the films under titles such as The Mischief Makers and Those Lovable Scallawags with Their Gangs. =King World's acquisition and edits= In 1963, Hal Roach Studios, by then run by Roach's son Hal Jr, filed for bankruptcy. A struggling novice syndication agent named Charles King purchased the television rights to The Little Rascals in the bankruptcy proceedings and returned the shorts to television. The success of The Little Rascals paved the way for King's new company, King World Productions, to grow into one of the largest television syndicators in the world. Currently, ViacomCBS, King World's latest successor, handles distribution rights. In 1971, because of controversy over some dated racial humor in the shorts and other content deemed to be in bad taste, King World made significant edits to Little Rascals TV prints. Many series entries were trimmed by two to four minutes, while others (among them Spanky, Bargain Day, The Pinch Singer and Mush and Milk) were cut to nearly half of their original length. At the same time, eight Little Rascals shorts were pulled from the King World television package altogether. Lazy Days, Moan and Groan, Inc., the Stepin Fetchit-guest-starred A Tough Winter, Little Daddy, A Lad an' a Lamp, The Kid From Borneo, and Little Sinner were deleted from the syndication package because of perceived racism, while Big Ears was deleted for its depiction of carelessly ingesting an assortment of drugs out of a medicine cabinet. The early talkie Railroadin' was never part of the television package because its soundtrack (recorded on phonographic records) was considered lost, although it was later found and restored to the film. Turner Entertainment acquired the classic MGM library in 1986, and the 1938‚Äì44 MGM-produced Our Gang shorts were shown on Turner's TBS and TNT cable networks for many years as early-morning programming filler, with a regular slot on Sundays at 6 am ET on TNT. In the early 2000s, the 71 films in the King World package were re- edited, reinstating many (though not all) edits made in 1971 and the original Our Gang title cards. These new television prints made their debut on the American Movie Classics cable network in 2001 and ran until 2003. =New Little Rascals productions= Many producers, including Our Gang alumnus Jackie Cooper, made pilots for new Little Rascals television series, but none ever went into production. In 1977, Norman Lear tried to revive the Rascals franchise, taping three pilot episodes of The Little Rascals. The pilots were not bought, but were notable for including Gary Coleman. 1979 brought The Little Rascals Christmas Special, an animated holiday special produced by Murakami-Wolf-Swenson, written by Romeo Muller and featuring the voice work of Darla Hood (who died suddenly before the special aired) and Matthew \\"Stymie\\" Beard. From 1982 to 1984, Hanna-Barbera Productions produced a Saturday morning cartoon version of The Little Rascals, which aired on ABC during The Pac-Man/Little Rascals/Richie Rich Show (later The Monchichis/Little Rascals/Richie Rich Show).McNeil, Alex (1996).

It starred the voices of Patty Maloney as Darla; Peter Cullen as Petey and Officer Ed; Scott Menville as Spanky; Julie McWhirter Dees as Alfalfa, Porky and The Woim; Shavar Ross as Buckwheat, and B.J. Ward as Butch and Waldo. In 1994, Amblin Entertainment and Universal Pictures released The Little Rascals, a feature film based loosely on the series and featuring interpretations of classic Our Gang shorts, including Hearts are Thumps, Rushin' Ballet, and Hi'-Neighbor! The film, directed by Penelope Spheeris, starred Travis Tedford as Spanky, Bug Hall as Alfalfa, and Ross Bagley as Buckwheat; with cameos by the Olsen twins, Whoopi Goldberg, Mel Brooks, Reba McEntire, Daryl Hannah, Donald Trump and Raven-Symon√©.The Little Rascals (1994).

The film was directed by Alex Zamm, and starred Jet Jurgensmeyer as Spanky, Drew Justice as Alfalfa, Eden Wood as Darla, and Doris Roberts as the kids' adopted Grandma. Legacy and influence Painted cover to Four Color Comics number 674, featuring \\"The Little Rascals\\" (Dell, January 1956). Artist: David Gantz. The characters in this series are well-known cultural icons, and identified solely by their first names. The characters of Alfalfa, Spanky, Buckwheat, Porky, Darla, Froggy, Butch, Woim, and Waldo were especially well known. Like many child actors, the Our Gang children were typecast and had trouble outgrowing their Our Gang images. Several Our Gang alumni, among them Carl \\"Alfalfa\\" Switzer, Scotty Beckett, Norman \\"Chubby\\" Chaney, Billy \\"Froggy\\" Laughlin, Donald Haines, Bobby \\"Wheezer\\" Hutchins, Darla Hood, Matthew \\"Stymie\\" Beard, Billie \\"Buckwheat\\" Thomas, and George \\"Spanky\\" McFarland, died before age 65, in most cases well earlier. This led to rumors of an Our Gang/Little Rascals \\"curse\\", rumors further popularized by a 2002 E! True Hollywood Story documentary entitled \\"The Curse of the Little Rascals\\".\\"E! True Hollywood Story: The Curse of the Little Rascals\\". IMDb.com. Retrieved April 19, 2007.

Retrieved April 19, 2007. The children's work in the series was largely unrewarded in later years, although Spanky McFarland was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame posthumously in 1994. Neither he nor any other Our Gang children received any residuals or royalties from reruns of the shorts or licensed products with their likenesses. The only remittances were their weekly salaries during their time in the gang, ranging from $40 a week for newcomers to $200 or more weekly for stars like Farina, Spanky, and Alfalfa. One notable exception was Jackie Cooper, who was later nominated for an Academy Award and had a career as an adult actor. Cooper is known today for portraying Perry White in the 1978‚Äì1987 Superman movies, and for directing episodes of TV series such as M*A*S*H and Superboy. Another was Robert Blake, who found great success in the 1960s and 1970s as an actor, with films like In Cold Blood (1967) and television shows like Baretta (1975‚Äì78), which netted him an Emmy Award. The 1930 Our Gang short Pups is Pups was an inductee of the 2004 National Film Registry list. =Imitators, followers, and frauds= Due to the popularity of Our Gang, many similar kid comedy short film series were created by competing studios. Among the most notable are The Kiddie Troupers, featuring future comedian Eddie Bracken; Baby Burlesks, featuring Shirley Temple; the Buster Brown comedies (from which Our Gang received Pete the Pup and director Gus Meins); and Our Gang's main competitor, the Toonerville Trolley-based Mickey McGuire series starring Mickey Rooney. Less notable imitations series include The McDougall Alley Gang (Bray Productions, 1927‚Äì1928), The Us Bunch and Our Kids. There is evidenceStreible, Dan. (2003) Itinerant Filmmakers and Amateur Casts: A Homemade Our Gang, 1926, Film History, An International Journal, Vol. 15, No. 2, pp. 177‚Äì92. that Our Gang- style productions were filmed in small towns and cities around the country using local children actors in the 1920s and 1930s. These productions did not appear to be affiliated with Hal Roach, but often used storylines from the shorts of the period, and sometimes went so far as to identify themselves as being Our Gang productions. In later years, many adults falsely claimed to have been members of Our Gang. A long list of people, including persons famous in other capacities such as Nanette Fabray, Eddie Bracken, and gossip columnist Joyce HaberLambert, Bruce. (August 1, 1993) Joyce Haber, a Gossip Columnist Known for Barbed Commentaries, The New York Times. claimed to be or have been publicly called former Our Gang children.Maltin & Bann, p. 241‚Äì242. Bracken's official biography was once altered to state that he appeared in Our Gang instead of The Kiddie Troupers, although he himself had no knowledge of the change. Among notable Our Gang imposters is Jack Bothwell, who claimed to have portrayed a character named \\"Freckles\\", going so far as to appear on the game show To Tell The Truth in the fall of 1957, perpetuating this fraud. In 2008, a Darla Hood impostor, Mollie Barron, died claiming to have appeared as Darla in Our Gang. Another is Bill English, a grocery store employee who appeared on the October 5, 1990, episode of the ABC investigative television newsmagazine 20/20 claiming to have been Buckwheat. Following the broadcast, Spanky McFarland informed the media of the truth, and in December, William Thomas, Jr. (son of Billie Thomas, the person who played Buckwheat) filed a lawsuit against ABC for negligence. =Persons and entities named after Our Gang= A number of groups, companies, and entities have been inspired by or named after Our Gang. The folk-rock group Spanky and Our Gang was named for the troupe because lead singer Elaine \\"Spanky\\" McFarlane's last name was similar to that of George \\"Spanky\\" McFarland. The band had no connection with the actual Our Gang series. Numerous unauthorized Little Rascals and Our Gang restaurants and day care centers also exist throughout the United States. Home media =1951-1992: 16 mm and VHS releases= In the 1950s, home movie distributor Official Films released many of the Hal Roach talkies on 16 mm film. These were released as \\"Famous Kid Comedies,\\" as Official could not use \\"Our Gang\\". The company's licensing only lasted for a short period. For years afterward, Blackhawk Films released 79 of the 80 Roach talkies on 8mm and 16 mm film. The sound discs for Railroadin' had been lost since the 1940s, and a silent print was available for home movie release until 1982, when the film's sound discs were located in the MGM vault and the short was restored with sound. Like the television prints, Blackhawk's Little Rascals reissues featured custom title cards in place of the original Our Gang logos, per MGM's 1949 arrangement with Hal Roach not to distribute the series under its original title. The films were otherwise offered unedited. In 1983, with the VHS home video market growing, Blackhawk began distributing Little Rascals VHS tapes through catalog orders, with three shorts per tape. Blackhawk Films was acquired in 1983 by National Telefilm Associates, later renamed Republic Pictures. Republic would release Little Rascals VHS volumes for retail purchase in non-comprehensive collections through the rest of the 1980s and early 1990s. By then, all but 11 of the Roach-era sound films were available on home video. =1993-present: Cabin Fever/Hallmark VHS and DVD releases= In 1993, Republic Pictures Home Video sold the home video rights for the 80 sound Roach shorts and some available silent shorts to Cabin Fever Entertainment. Cabin Fever acquired the rights to use the original Our Gang title cards and MGM logos, and for the first time in over 50 years, the Roach sound Our Gang comedies could be commercially exhibited in their original formats. The first twelve volumes of Cabin Fever's The Little Rascals VHS set were released on July 6, 1994, followed by nine more on July 11, 1995, coinciding with the theatrical and home video releases of Universal's 1994 feature. Each tape contained four shorts, as well as newly-produced introductions by film historian Leonard Maltin. With these releases, Cabin Fever made all 80 Roach sound shorts, and four silents, available for purchase unedited with digitally restored picture and sound. On August 26, 1997, a limited-edition volume, For Pete's Sake, was released in honor of the Rascals' 75th anniversary with an introduction from original cast member Tommy \\"Butch\\" Bond and \\"Petey,\\" the dog from the 1994 feature. The video contained three previously-released shorts and the previously-unreleased silent short Dog Heaven; the VHS tape was also available in a gift set with a Pete plush doll. Cabin Fever began pressing DVD versions of their first 12 Little Rascals VHS volumes, with the contents of two VHS volumes included on each DVD, but went out of business in 1998 before their release. The Little Rascals home video rights were then sold to Hallmark Entertainment in 1999, who released the DVDs without an official launch while cleaning out their warehouse in early 2000. Hallmark colorized a few Our Gang shorts and released them across 8 VHS tapes. Later that year, the first 10 Cabin Fever volumes were re-released on VHS with new packaging, and the first two volumes were released on DVD as The Little Rascals: Volumes 1‚Äì2. Two further Hallmark DVD collections featured ten shorts apiece and were released in 2003 and 2005, respectively. From 2006 to 2009, Legend Films produced colorized versions of twenty-four Our Gang comedies (23 Roach entries, and the public domain MGM entry Waldo's Last Stand), which were released across five Little Rascals DVDs. In 2011, Legend Films released black and white versions of Little Rascals DVDs. RHI Entertainment and Genius Products released an eight-disc DVD set, The Little Rascals ‚Äì the Complete Collection, on October 28, 2008. This set includes all 80 Hal Roach-produced Our Gang sound short films. Most of the collection uses the 1994 restorations, while 16 shorts are presented with older Blackhawk Films transfers as their remastered copies were lost or misplaced during preparations. On June 14, 2011, Vivendi Entertainment re-released seven of the eight DVD's from RHI/Genius Products' The Little Rascals ‚Äì The Complete Collection as individual releases. This includes the 80 shorts ‚Äì replacing the Blackhawk transfers on the previous set with their respective 1994 restorations ‚Äì but excludes the disc featuring the extras. =1980s-present: MGM/Warner Bros. releases= During the 1980s and 1990s, MGM released several non-comprehensive VHS tapes of its shorts, and a VHS of the feature General Spanky. After video rights for the classic MGM library reverted to their new owners, Turner Entertainment/Warner Bros., in the late 1990s, four of the MGM Our Gang shorts appeared as bonus features on Warner Bros.-issued classic film DVD releases. In 2009, Warner Home Video released all 52 MGM Our Gang shorts in a compilation titled The Our Gang Collection: 1938‚Äì1942 (though it contains the 1943‚Äì44 shorts as well) for manufacture-on-demand (MOD) DVD and digital download. The set is available by mail order and digital download as part of the Warner Archive Collection, and is available for purchase via the iTunes Store. A MOD release of General Spanky was also released by Warner Archive in 2016. There are many unofficial Our Gang and Little Rascals home video collections available from several other distributors, comprising shorts (both silent and sound) which have fallen into the public domain. Status of ownership Currently, the rights to the Our Gang/Little Rascals shorts are divided.

CBS Television Distribution, through King World Productions, owns the rights to the Little Rascals trademark and has all other media rights to the 1929-1938 Roach shorts, which constitute The Little Rascals television package, with certain territory exclusions controlled by Cinematografische Commers Anatalt. CBS offers original black-and-white and colorized prints for syndication. The King World/CBS Little Rascals package was featured as exclusive programming (in the United States) for the American Movie Classics network from August 2001 to December 2003, with Frankie Muniz hosting. As part of a month-long tribute to Hal Roach Studios, Turner Classic Movies televised a 24-hour marathon of Roach Our Gang shorts - both sound films and silents ‚Äì on January 4‚Äì5, 2011. Some of the silent Our Gangs (such as Mary, Queen of Tots and Thundering Fleas) resurfaced on TCM at this time with new music scores in stereo sound; these silent Path√© Our Gangs are now being syndicated by Mackinaw Media. The MGM-produced Our Gang shorts, General Spanky, and the rights to the Our Gang name are owned by Warner Bros. through Turner Entertainment. Turner Entertainment acquired these assets in 1986 when its founder, Ted Turner, purchased the pre-May 1986 MGM library; Turner merged with Time Warner in 1996.(09-26-1996).\\"Warner Bros. to Run Most of Turner's Entertainment Units\\".

At the 2016 census, Loxton had a population of 4,568. It is a service town for the surrounding districts. The area near Loxton is a significant citrus fruit and summer fruit growing area. Loxton is also the main town for the northern part of the Murray Mallee which is a dryland farming and grain cropping area. Loxton has a pioneer settlement museum (known as the Loxton Historical Village), preserving the heritage of the mallee region. It is also famous for the \\"Loxton Lights Up\\" Christmas Festival in December each year, and the annual 120m Loxton Gift handicap sprint race held in late February. The town hosts the second round of the Australian HPV Super Series in May annually. Loxton is the seat of the local government area of the District Council of Loxton Waikerie. It is in the South Australian House of Assembly electoral district of Chaffey and the Australian House of Representatives division of Barker. The town is home to a variety of service clubs, most notably the Apex Club, Rotary Club and Lions Club. Media Historically, Loxton has been home to several newspapers. These include: * Loxton Clarion (and Murray lands Advocate) (2 July 1925‚Äì2 October 1928) - The Loxton Clarion's proprietor, Jack Irving, endeavoured to produce a publication reflecting the concerns of Loxton and surrounding districts. Its articles covered crops, care of livestock, vehicle maintenance, and local sport. From 23 July 1925, it was known as The Loxton Clarion and Murray Lands Guardian. In late 1928, it was absorbed into The Murray Pioneer and Australian River Record. * Loxton Community Newsletter (June 1956‚ÄìMarch 1960) - A monthly newspaper, published by The Loxton District War Memorial Community Centre, and incorporated into the Loxton News in 1960. * Loxton News (28 April 1960‚Äì2020) - Irving came out of retirement to found a new newspaper. In 1964 it (like Irving's Clarion) was sold to the Murray Pioneer. The newspaper has gone on to win many Country Press SA awards. Transport The first form of regular transport to Loxton was paddle steamers on the Murray River. The Loxton railway line was completed in 1914 connecting via Alawoona and Tailem Bend to Adelaide. Loxton today is connected by road to the Sturt Highway which passes nearby at Kingston-on-Murray and is the northern terminus of the Karoonda Highway and eastern terminus of the Stott Highway. The railway now terminates at the Tookayerta grain terminal a few kilometres out of town, but does not carry passengers, and is anticipated to close completely in 2015.  Salt interception scheme  Loxton is a town with many farms and fruit crops. The joint programme of salt interception schemes to help keep salt out of the River Murray, costing an estimated $60 million, commenced in 2001. This programme was expected to deliver 61 EC at Morgan by December 2007. The partner Governments of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia and the Commonwealth have agreed that joint salt interception schemes must both be economically and technically feasible. Loxton Gift The Loxton Gift athletics carnival offers the most prize money in South Australia apart from the Bay Sheffield held at Glenelg. The program includes races from 70m to 1000m and is the final major South Australian lead-up event to the Stawell Gift held at Easter.  Loxton Pedal Prix  Since 2014, the streets of the town have been shut off in May for the running of the Loxton Pedal Prix, which is a round of the Australian HPV Super Series. The track incorporates the major central roundabout and the surrounding main streets. It includes two long 600m straights, one uphill and one downhill. The event has proved popular with locals, riders and spectators alike, and is now a mainstay on the Australian HPV Super Series calendar. In 2018 it will be round 2 of the series.

History A precursor to \\"Gift Grub\\" originally aired on Today FM's predecessor, Radio Ireland, as a series of sketches called \\"Starship Compromise\\". This Star Trek parody featured a caricature of Gerry Adams as a starship captain accompanied by Martin McGuinness, with the two scouring the galaxy, seeking compromise with alien beings. In 1998, presenter Ian Dempsey joined the newly renamed Today FM which had replaced Radio Ireland. A year later, in March 1999, Paul McLoone joined Today FM and became a producer for the Ian Dempsey Breakfast Show. McLoone and Irish comedian Mario Rosenstock later came up with and developed the concept of \\"Gift Grub\\". The first Gift Grub sketch aired on the Ian Dempsey Breakfast Show in early May 1999. The name of the sketches have their basis in the format of the original pieces, in which the character of Bertie Ahern (Ireland's former Taoiseach) would introduce the listening public to favourite (\\"Gift\\") meals or food items (\\"Grub\\"). For the next five years, McLoone and Rosenstock participated in various sketches either together or separately with four volumes of Gift Grub being released on CD. McLoone resigned from Today FM in 2004, spending the next two years freelancing, before returning to the station in 2006. After McLoone's departure from \\"Gift Grub\\", Rosenstock voiced the show's characters. These characters are generally based on real people, typically Irish or international celebrities and political figures. In 2006, the satirist and impressionist Oliver Callan who had previously contributed to \\"Gift Grub\\" sketches, reportedly took legal action over the release of a compilation album of sketches. The popularity of the show has generated a number of spin-off compilations and catchphrases. These include the phrases \\"Infacta\\", \\"Jaysus\\" and \\"Ya Spanner\\", originally delivered by Rosenstock's Bertie Ahern character. Rosenstock has performed live stage versions of several sketches and characters, in shows titled \\"Gift Grub Live\\". Notable sketches Writers of the series respond to current news and events by writing satire on recent events. One episode involved the re-writing of the song Dry Your Eyes by The Streets, in which Roy Keane sings to David Beckham, consoling him on England's loss to France in UEFA Euro 2004. In a poll of Today FM listeners, this sketch was voted the \\"all time favourite\\" Gift Grub sketch. In 2005, a sketch entitled \\"Jos√© and his Amazing Technicolor Overcoat\\", mimicking Chelsea boss Jos√© Mourinho,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkKDaOuDh9U caught the attention of football fans in the UK and reportedly reached number 45 in the UK singles chart. Rosenstock was invited by Mourinho to attend a match at Stamford Bridge. This track, along with \\"I Sign a Little Player or Two\\", based on Aretha Franklin's I Say a Little Prayer, were broadcast on London's Capital Gold radio station. In December 2005, a parody of Will Young's song Leave Right Now,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQt-J1dkk_o relating to the events surrounding Roy Keane's dismissal from Manchester United, was released as a charity single in Ireland. With proceeds going to the Irish Guide Dogs Association, it entered the charts and was the Christmas number one in 2005. In March 2007, the real Roy Keane met with Ian Dempsey to promote the Irish Guide Dogs Foundation and was introduced to the Gift Grub Roy. Previous guests who were invited on the show to meet their Gift Grub equivalents included Hector √ì hEochag√°in, Eddie Hobbs, and Ronan Keating. Bertie Ahern also joined the show to celebrate the segment's tenth anniversary. In November 2009, Today FM released a special 10-year edition of the annual 'Best of' CD. This included 3 CDs, including a 'best of 2009' CD, a 'best of the decade' CD, and an unreleased sketches CD.

Before taking the throne Scerdilaidas was commander of the Illyrian armies and played a major role in the Illyrian Wars against the Romans.Wilkes, J. J. The Illyrians, 1992, , Page 129, \\"... because no coins are known to have been issued by Illyrian rulers of a later period such as Agron, Teuta, Scerdilaidas, etc. ...\\" Scerdilaidas was one of the youngest brothers of Agron and father of Pleuratus III and grandfather of Gentius.√âpire, Illyrie, Mac√©doine: m√©langes offerts au professeur Pierre Cabanes by Dani√®le Berranger, Pierre Cabanes, Dani√®le Berranger-Auserve, page 133 Scerdilaidas took part in many expeditions in the Ionian and Aegean with Demetrius and his brother-in-law Amynas of Athamania. During his early reign Scerdilaidas was an ally of Rome. In 217 BC Scerdilaidas later adopted Roman rule and became an enemy of Macedonia for parleying with Rome. With the Romans invested by Hannibal, Philip V of Macedon sought to take southern Illyria from Scerdilaidas and made several advancements into the Ardiaean State from 214 BC to 210 BC. In reaction, the Aetolian League and the Dardanians under Longarus joined with Scerdilaidas to defeat the Macedonians in 208 BC. With no chance of victory, Philip V accepted peace in 205 BC. The Adriatic during the reign of Scerdilaidas Unlike most other Illyrian kings of which there is only sparse data, Scerdilaidas is mentioned in the writings of the historian Appian, Livy and Polybius, and in their chronicles of the Roman and Greek wars.:bs:Scerdilaidas Commander =Under Teuta= Long before he became king, Scerdilaidas was a leader who helped determine Illyrian policy. He was the commander of the Illyrian army during the reign of his brother, Agron. Scerdilaidas also served under Teuta and even Demetrius of Pharos. He was one of the leading supporters of Queen Teuta when she took on the regency of Pinnes. He played a determining role in the plans of Teuta to create an Adriatic front against Rome. Under the reign of Teuta, Scerdilaidas was the commander of a large land force of 5,000 during the Invasion of Epirus in 230 BC. Scerdilaidas marched south through the pass at Antigoneia to assist Teuta's forces at the Epirote capital of Phoenice. News that Scerdilaidas was on his way caused the Epirotes to send part of their forces north to secure the city. After the Illyrian victory at the Battle of Phoenice, Epirus begged for assistance from the Greek Leagues, while Teuta's army, having joined up with the forces led by Scerdilaidas, marched inland to Halicranum deep in the heart of Epirus, on the plain of modern Ioannina. Scerdilaidas chose a good position and prepared the army for battle against the Leagues the next day which he believed he would win. Orders to withdraw arrived from Teuta because some of the revolting Illyrians within the Ardiaean State had joined the influential Dardanian State under Longarus who wanted to invade the northern regions of Teuta's state. Scerdilaidas was forced to return and secure the Ardiaean State's northern borders from Longarus. As Scerdilaidas marched north, Teuta secured a peace treaty in favour of the Ardiaean State.John Wilkes pg.158-159 While still in Epirus Scerdilaidas led a fleet of lembi on the Ionian Sea and swept through Corfu and Onchesmos and intercepted and plundered some merchant vessels of Rome.Wilkes 1995, p. 158. After the defeat of Teuta during the First Illyrian War in 228 BC, young Pinnes, formally King of Illyria under Teuta's regency, was confirmed to remain king of a limited Ardiaean State by the victorious Romans. Soon the regency was taken over by Demetrius of Pharos, who married Pinnes' mother, Triteuta, the divorced wife of Scerdilaidas' brother Agron. This happened most probably without consent of Rome, even if Demetrius was their ally. =Under Demetrius= In 220 BC Demetrius and Scerdilaidas made a joint expedition down the Ionian coast to the Peloponnese with 90 lembi, and thus Demetrius violated the treaty with Rome by sailing south of the coastal city of Lissus. After an assault on Pylos in the western Peloponnese was successful, they divided their force.The Hellenistic world and the coming of Rome, Volume 1 by Erich S. Gruen Demetrius with fifty ships sailed on a raiding expedition in the Aegean against the Cyclades, while Scerdilaidas with the remaining forty ships agreed to support the Aetolians in an invasion of the Achaean League.Polybius 4.16, 6-8Polybius 4.25.4 On putting in at Naupactus, Scerdilaidas was encouraged by his brother- in-law Amynas, king of the Athamanes, to join them in the planned invasion of Achaea. Scerdilaidas and his allies also attacked but failed to take Cleitor. While Scerdilaidas collaborated with the Aetolians, Demetrius was persuaded to assist the Macedonian cause against Aetolia on his return via the Isthmus of Corinth.Polybius 4.19, 7-9 Demetrius returned to the Ardiaean State and began to revive Illyrian power. However, he was beaten by the Romans in 219 BC during the Second Illyrian War. Relations with Macedon After the Second Illyrian War, Pinnes was again proclaimed king. Pinnes was not favoured among the Illyrians and in 218 BC Scerdilaidas took over his nephew's role and became king. Under pressure from the Carthaginians in Spain, the Romans did not intervene. In 220 BC Scerdilaidas entered into an alliance with Philip V of Macedon. Scerdilaidas had aided Philip during the Social War against the Spartans but this produced little profit for him.Rome and the Mediterranean to 133 B.C. by A. E. Astin, F. W. Walbank, M. W. Frederiksen, pg.95 Scerdilaidas' support for Macedon against the Aetolians was curtailed by 'plots and conflicts' caused by rulers of various cities. In 217 BC, Scerdilaidas ceased his support for Philip V, maintaining that a promised subsidy was unpaid and long overdue. He dispatched 15 ships, ostensibly to collect and escort the payment, but at the island of Leucas south of Corcyra his forces killed two of Philip's Corinthian allies and seized their four ships.√âpire, Illyrie, Mac√©doine: m√©langes offerts au professeur Pierre Cabanes by Dani√®le Berranger, Pierre Cabanes,Dani√®le Berranger-Auserve, page 130 Scerdilaidas' fleet then sailed south and began to plunder shipping around Cape Malea in the southern Peloponnese. In response, Philip prepared a strong naval force of twelve decked ships, eight open vessels and thirty hemioliae, which headed south at full speed to deal with Scerdilaidas. This counter attack by Philip was too slow and missed its targets. Scerdilaidas went on to march into Dassaretia, taking several cities and invading parts of western Macedonia. He looted Pissaeum in Pelagonia and overran some frontier districts of Macedon. Before the winter Philip had occupied the area of Lyncestis, cutting off the direct route from Illyria, and extended his power to Dassaretia. Philip was planning an invasion of Illyria. However, in doing so, he would face not only the lembi of Scerdilaidas, but also the heavier warships of the Roman navy.Hammond 1968 First Macedonian War Scerdilaidas soon entered into an alliance with Rome. Influenced by Demetrius, Philip's first target was the Illyrian coast. In 216 BC he had built a fleet of one hundred light warships, using Illyrian shipwrights. He led his fleet around the Peloponnese into the Adriatic, gambling that Rome, deeply involved in the Hannibal crisis, would not intervene.Polybius 5.109.2 Scerdilaidas appealed for help and the Romans sent ten heavy quinqueremes from Sicily.Polybius 5.110.8 Philip fled and the invasion of Illyria was avoided for the moment. Twice thwarted in attempts at invasion of Illyria by sea, and now constrained by Laevinus' fleet in the Adriatic, Philip spent 213 BC and 212 BC making advances in Illyria by land. Keeping clear of the coast, he took the inland towns of Atintania and Dimale, and subdued theSmith, William (2006). A New Classical Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography, Mythology and Geography.

He died sometime before the treaty in 205 BC as only his son Pleuratus III is listed among those present at Phoenice.√âpire, Illyrie, Mac√©doine: m√©langes offerts au professeur Pierre Cabanes by Dani√®le Berranger, Pierre Cabanes, Dani√®le Berranger-Auserve, page 137  See also  * Illyrian warfare * List of rulers of Illyria Sources =Citations= =Bibliography=  * Category:Illyrian royalty Category:3rd-century BC births Category:3rd-century BC rulers Category:First Macedonian War Category:206 BC deaths ","title":"Scerdilaidas"},{"id":"2438241","text":"James Taylor (born 1948) is an American singer/songwriter and guitarist.

In 2004, Bo≈°tjan Pristavec broke the world record in the ultra-light sailplane class. His average speed flown with the Slovenian sailplane Apis was 118.44 km/h. The record still holds to this day. Many club pilots fly cross-country flights. They are very active on the OLC Online contest, where the best results from the club can be found. The glider pilots from Lesce also frequently take the highest places in the national gliding competitions. One of the best flights were the 750 km FAI (F√©d√©ration A√©ronautique Internationale) triangle from Miha Thaler, 1000 km flight by Miha Thaler and a 1000 km flight flown by Bo≈°tjan Pristavec. Recreational facilities The airfield has a separate area with sanitary facilities and all necessary conditions for camping. There is also restaurant with terrace offering a view on the airfield. History The aviation activity in this area began in first world war when it was used as an auxiliary airfield of the Austro-Hungarian Air Force during the Isonzo front. It was then used as the auxiliary German airfield during the second world war, but the airfield was plagued by the frequent flooding and terrain instability. The republic gliding center was established there in 1947 to explore soaring in the mountains. A hangar was relocated from Kompolje and remains at the airport to this day. After the war a new grass runway was constructed to remediate the flooding, which was completed in 1954. In 1956, the Alpski letalski center flying club was founded and continued with tradition of numerous pre-war flying clubs in the vicinity. In July 1957 JAT Yugoslav Airlines opened the Belgrade-Bled route with a Douglas DC-3 airliner., however the commercial traffic ceased with the opening of Ljubljana airport in 1963. Since then, the airport served mainly for sport and panoramic flying, but the sudden reduction of state funding forced the flying club members to find other sources of income, by doing various jobs for the local companies, thus collecting the money to buy new aircraft and pay for their flying. Lesce airport was also one of the few airports in Yugoslavia where the flying of the foreign pilots was allowed, thus greatly contributing to the tourism in the region. Many aviation-related business emerged because of the airport. Elan started the production of Glaser-Dirks gliders and the former employees of Elan Flight still continue with a business of aircraft construction and repair.

Formed in 1968, they won four British League titles during their history. The club closed in October 2008 after the lease on Smallmead Stadium was sold and the site was demolished. In 2016 A group of Supporters got together to bring back the Racers. After holding various meeting throughout 2016, In September the Reading Racers rode in a challenge match against Weymouth Wildcats. In the Winter of 2016 The Speedway Action Group showed their interest in entering the SDL Southern Development League. This league was given the go ahead from the Speedway Control board and Reading Racers along with Weymouth, Plymouth,Kent and Exeter formed the SDL. Reading have a Facebook and Twitter page also they have launched ReadingRacers.co.uk as their official website. The 2017 season was Reading's first back in a League since 2008. They were unbeaten during the season and are the current Southern development League Champions. 2018 the Racers will contest the 2nd year of the Southern development League, Their home track again this year will be Eastbourne. In 2019 the Reading Racers returned closer to home, they will be using the home of the Swindon Robins at Blunsden for their home matches. After a good start to the 2019 season they had some very bad news that up and coming star Sam Norris had a serious crash and was in intensive care with a brain injury. This shook the whole Racers team and management. The Racers didn't really recovery from this and finished the season mid table. After the 2019 season ended the Racers management Emma Stevens, Andy Griffin, Gene Carter and Mat Stevens started to plan for the 2020 season, they continued to make a number of contacts and leads to find a piece of Land in the Reading area ensuring the BSPA were kept up to date showing them details of progress which was asked for the previous season. Of which the Racers thought was sufficient as we were not asked for more from anyone from the SCB or BSPA. At the beginning of 2020 the team started to come together, only to be told by the BSPA that no nomadic teams could race unless they had their own track. So the Racers decided to take a break from the 2020 season to concentrate on following up plans to raise funds and find a Willing sponsor to build their Dream track back in the Reading area. After the Covid19 outbreak the whole Speedway season was put on hold. History The club was formed in 1968 and were originally based at the Tilehurst Stadium until it was closed in 1973. In their final year the Racers won their first British League title with the regular septet of Peter Murray, Richard May, Anders Michanek, Dag L√∂vaas, Geoff Curtis, Mick Bell and Bernie Leigh.. Smallmead Stadium was constructed during 1974 near the site of a refuse tip close to Junction 11 of the M4 motorway. The Racers returned for the 1975 seasonLawson,K (2018) ‚ÄúRiders, Teams and Stadiums‚Äù. , a crowd of 9,264 witnessed the opening meeting against Hull and Reading won the match by 18 points. The club finished 6th that campaign and had an average crowd of almost 6,500 every meeting. Between 1976 and 1979 the crowd figures remained high, despite a poor 1978 when the club finished 14th out 19 teams. Reading Racers at the Smallmead Stadium in 1975 The club enjoyed a successful 1980 season, winning the British League title and attracting crowds of over 7,000 on a regular basis. The club made headline news with a ¬£40,000 insurance bond payment for winning the league title, which gained much media interest. However, behind the scenes unrest in the management structure saw major changes at the end of the season with Bill Dore taking control of the club with local businessman Frankie Higley. Dore's daughter Pat Bliss became more involved in the running of the speedway and Dore's son Martyn was tasked with the maintenance of the track and stadium. Despite tracking very competitive looking teams in the mid-1980s the club never achieved the dizzy heights of the start of the decade, until 1990 when the appointment of loyal fan Tim Sugar as the team manager saw the club win the league title in both 1990 and 1992, with top rider Per Jonsson also crowned world speedway champion in 1990. However, Jonsson suffered terrible injuries in a crash in Poland in 1994, and this had an adverse effect on the club and its fortunes. 1995 and 1996 were poor seasons for the club, as crowds dropped and media interest waned. The 1997 season saw the club stay in the Premier League, which became the second tier after the Elite League was formed; This bought some much needed success for the club as they were crowned league champions that year, with Dave Mullett (who had been part of the championship winning teams in 1990 and 1992) proving to be the best rider in the league, subsequently won the league cup in 1998. The period 1999 to 2003 were lean years for the club, which had seen veteran promoter Chris Shears and his son Ivan become part of the promotional set up. By 2004, Ivan Shears (who soon earned the nickname of the tactical genius) had replaced long standing team manager Sugar and the club showed signs of resurgence with a large sponsorship deal with local telecomms company Euphony Communications. This secured the funds for the signature of leading English rider Danny Bird and highly rated Slovenian Matej ≈Ωagar. Injuries at key times denied Racers more success that year, but Bird along with loyal servant to the club Phil Morris (who replaced an injured ≈Ωagar) won the Premier League Pairs Championship in June of that season. 2005 was a disappointing season for Reading and by the end of the campaign there were signs that the club need new investment to survive. Consequently, the promotion sold the club to BSI Speedway in 2006. The new promotion took Reading into the Elite League and changed the club name to the Reading Bulldogs. Their first season was a huge success on track as the Bulldogs narrowly missed out on the title, losing by a single point to Peterborough Panthers in the play-off final. The success on track wasn't mirrored off track, as crowds were on average around 650 people short of the 2,000 required each meeting to break even, the fact that Smallmead Stadium had no seen no real investment to its infrastructure since it was built was a key factor in this, although many fans also blamed the changing of the club nickname from Racers to Bulldogs, a move which had seen a number of the hardcore fans of the club boycott meetings as a protest. The majority of the successful 2006 team were retained for the 2007 season, but crowds dropped alarmingly, with some meetings being witnessed by less than 900 fans. This led to BSI deciding to put the club up for sale mid-season, which resulted in the club being purchased by Swindon-based businessman Mark Legg, who appointed ex- rider Malcolm Holloway as his co-promoter, with the astute Tim Sugar returning as Team Manager, whilst the club's press officer and webmaster Andy Povey was appointed to head up rider recruitment, marketing and commercial activities. It was confirmed at the time of the takeover that Reading would see out the remaining fixtures of the 2007 season in the Elite League. the club also reverted to their original Reading Racers name. the new promotion and new change had little effect on the crowds and the new owners lost a reported six figure sum in the space of four months. As a result, the club opted to drop a division to the Premier League in 2008, the season was a traumatic time on and off track for the club. Povey and Holloway's team building decisions proved disastrous, with only Dane Ulrich √òstergaard's performances saving their blushes on numerous occasions. However performances on track were overshadowed by the news that the Smallmead Stadium lease expired in October 2008 and would not be renewed. A final farewell meeting was held on 19 October as a near capacity crowd of 3,200 including former Reading riders Anders Michanek, Jan Andersson, Bernie Leigh, John Davis, Richard May, Tony Olsson and Phil Morris witnessed Ulrich Ostergaard win the ¬£3,000 winner's purse. Stadium plans With Smallmead Stadium's lease expiring in October 2008, the club announced plans for new stadium at Island Road, Reading. A new complex featuring greyhound racing, and a casino as well as speedway has been given the go ahead by the local council. The plans showed the new track will be ten metres longer than the track at Smallmead, which was their home for last thirty-two years (it was always intended to be a temporary track but the new stadium never got built). However the construction of the new stadium has been delayed numerous times and now will not be ready until the 2012 season at the earliest. The plans for the new stadium did not go ahead as agreed. The Reading Speedway Action Group are currently seeking new Land in the area. The Reading Racers return to track in 2017 at an adopted home in Eastbourne. They completed in the Southern development League and won the league to be One the inaugural winners of the new League. In 2018 they again used Eastbourne as their home track and finished second to Kent kings in the league. In 2019 they were given a chance to come closer to home by using Swindon as they home track. This season started well, but due to a very bad injury to One of their star riders Sam Norris the team struggled to get a replacement and finished mid table. Promotional changes In July 2010 it was reported that Reading based entrepreneur Andy Povey had purchased the promotional rights to the club from Legg. Povey had been part of the backroom set up at Reading since 2001 and held responsibility for the design and build of the club website, public relations, marketing and commercial activities. He is also engaged by the British Speedway Promoters Association as their head of Marketing and Communications, also acting as the interface between the sport and SKY Sports, working closely with SKY's chief commentator and presenter Nigel Pearson. The Promoter rights are now with the Reading Speedway Action Group who are seeking land in the Berkshire area to build a stadium, to bring Racers home. Their vision is to be in the Berkshire area by 2020.

He played in one retrospectively recognised Test match for England. He was born in Downend, near Bristol and died in Basingstoke, Hampshire. A right-handed batsman who bowled right arm fast roundarm, he appeared in 195 matches that are generally rated first-class for statistical purposes.\\"First-class cricket\\" was officially defined in May 1894 by a meeting at Lord's of Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and the county clubs which were then competing in the County Championship. The ruling was effective from the beginning of the 1895 season. Pre-1895 matches of the same standard have no official definition of status because the ruling is not retrospective and the \\"unofficial first-class\\" designation, as applied to a given match, is based on the views of one or more substantial historical sources. For further information, see First-class cricket, Forms of cricket and History of cricket. In these matches, Grace scored 6,906 runs with a highest score of 189*. An outstanding fielder and occasional wicket-keeper, he held 170 catches and completed three stumpings. He took 329 wickets with a best performance of eight for 43.Fred Grace at CricketArchiveFred Grace at ESPNcricinfo Fred Grace was the youngest member of the Grace family. He had four elder brothers who all played cricket: Henry, Alfred, \\"EM\\" and \\"WG\\". In some contemporary texts, he was called \\"G. F. Grace\\", using his initials in the same way as for both EM and WG but in fact he was widely known as Fred while they were always known by their initials only. His two oldest brothers were always known by their first names, Henry and Alfred.Rae, pp. 15‚Äì16.Midwinter, pp. 86‚Äì87.Birley, p. 104. Although the England v Australia match at The Oval in September 1880 was granted Test status retrospectively, it is the first instance of three brothers playing together in a Test match with EM, WG and Fred all members of the England team. Grace was always praised for his fielding and, in that Test match, he held what has been called \\"the most famous deep field catch in history\\". During the match, he developed a cold which, because he was exposed to wet weather over the next few days, escalated to pneumonia. He died, aged 29, only two weeks after playing for England. Career =Learning the game= Like his brothers, Grace learned how to play cricket at home on a practice pitch that the family had created on the site of a former orchard. He was coached by his father, Dr Henry Grace, and his uncle, Alfred Pocock. His mother, Martha, was a keen participant too and she provided the driving force and the motivation which crystallised into the competitive edge that EM, WG and Fred always had as first-class players. EM, several years older than WG and Fred, learned to play using a full size bat and, because it was too big for him as a boy, he developed a tendency to hit across the line of delivery instead of playing straight. Alfred Pocock recognised this fault and decided that WG and Fred must learn to play straight by using small bats, suitable for their boyhood sizes. It meant that WG and Fred became technically correct batsmen with strong defensive techniques whereas EM remained primarily an attacking batsman. In his Cricketing Reminiscences (1899), W. G. Grace emphasised that \\"cricketers are made by coaching and practice\\", but he and his brothers were born \\"in the atmosphere of cricket\\".W. G. Grace, Reminiscences, p. 1. Their parents and uncle were \\"full of enthusiasm for the game\\" and it was \\"a common theme of conversation at home\\".W. G. Grace, Reminiscences, p. 2. It was in the Downend orchard and as members of their local cricket clubs that Grace and his brothers developed their skills, mainly under the tutelage of Alfred Pocock, who was an exceptional coach. Apart from their cricket and schooling, the brothers lived in the country and roamed freely with other village boys. One of their regular activities, to help local farmers, was stone throwing at birds in the fields and WG later claimed that this was the source of their eventual skills as outfielders. Fred Grace, in particular, became an outstanding fielder.Rae, p. 21. Grace first attracted notice in club cricket, playing for his father's West Gloucestershire Cricket Club in 1864 when still only 13. Despite his coaching, it was said of him then that he did not play with so \\"straight a bat\\" as WG, but was \\"more resolute in his hitting\\".Rae, pp. 57‚Äì58. Mention was made of the great promise shown in his fielding, always an outstanding feature of his game; he was hailed as \\"a glorious field\\".Barclays, p. 14. Grace's height was about 5ft 10in, so he was three inches taller than EM and four inches shorter than WG.Midwinter, p. 20. His earliest appearance in a match now rated first-class was Monday, 21 to Tuesday, 22 May 1866 at the Magdalen Ground, Oxford for a hastily organised Gentlemen of England XI against Oxford University (OUCC), the university winning by 10 wickets.Oxford University v. Gentlemen of England, 1866 ‚Äì match scorecard Aged 15, Grace took a wicket and had scores of 0 and 10. WG, aged 17, was in the same team and it was at this match that WG received an invitation from Edmund Carter to join the OUCC, but he had to refuse because his father intended him for medical school.Midwinter, p. 30.Rae, p. 63. In due course, Fred would follow him into the study of medicine.Rae, p. 142. =Gloucestershire becomes a first-class county= On Thursday, 25 June 1868, Grace played for the new Gloucestershire County Cricket Club in its first-ever match, which was a two-day game at Lord's against Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). His brothers EM and WG were in the same team but the match was by no means first-class. Gloucestershire won by 134 runs.Birley, p. 104.MCC v Gloucestershire, 1868 ‚Äì scorecard The county club was not actually new because it had pre-existed for over twenty years as the West Gloucestershire Cricket Club, based in Bristol and effectively run by the Grace family. It renamed itself as the county club in 1867 but it did not have a county-wide remit because of a rival club called the Cheltenham and Gloucestershire Cricket Club.Rae, p. 89. It is generally agreed that the inaugural first-class match played by Gloucestershire County Cricket Club, per se, was against Surrey at Durdham Down, Clifton from Wednesday, 2 to Friday, 4 June 1870. EM, WG and Fred Grace all played for Gloucestershire who won by 51 runs. Grace bowled well, taking four for 56 and four for 31. He scored 16 (hit wicket) and 15 which were useful runs in a low-scoring (<500) match.Gloucestershire v Surrey, 1870 ‚Äì scorecard The county club has always dated its foundation to 1870 (it celebrated its centenary in 1970) but its formal constitution was not completed until March 1871 when it finally merged with the Cheltenham and Gloucestershire. =1870 ‚Äì an established player= With Gloucestershire now a first-class county, Grace set about establishing himself as a first-class player. Like EM and WG, he was a genuine all-rounder. On Thursday, 14 July, Grace made his debut for the Gentlemen in the prestigious Gentlemen v Players fixture at The Oval. He failed with the bat and scored two ducks but he succeeded with the ball. After the Gentlemen had scored 198, the Players struggled and were dismissed for 148 with Grace taking five for 38. It was the first time he captured five wickets in a first-class innings (his previous best was his four for 31 in the county match against Surrey). The Gentlemen's second innings belonged to WG who hit 215, well supported by Walter Money with 109*. They totalled 513 but didn't leave themselves time to bowl the Players out. Although Grace again bowled well, taking three for 9 in 15 overs, the Players with 109 for four held on for the draw.Gentlemen v Players, The Oval, 1870 ‚Äì scorecard From Thursday, 18 to Saturday, 20 August 1870, Grace played alongside WG for the Gentlemen of the South against the Gentlemen of the North at Meadow Road, Beeston. The North, captained by WG's long-time rival A. N. Hornby, won the toss and decided to bat first. They scored 287, WG taking six for 89 and Fred one for 53 (Hornby scored 103). The South were 6 for one at close of play on Thursday. WG, who opened the innings, went on to make 77 on Friday morning, sharing a third wicket partnership of 122 with Isaac Walker. When he was out, Fred came in to join Walker and came of age as a cricketer. They shared a stand of 294 for the fourth wicket, broken when Walker was out for 179. There was then something of a collapse as the South went from 430 for four to 482 all out just before the close. Fred scored 189 not out and that remained his career-highest innings. On the final day, the North managed to avoid the innings defeat and amassed 289 (WG three for 83; Fred two for 61) to ensure a draw.Gentlemen of the North v Gentlemen of the South ‚Äì scorecard Prior to this match, Grace's highest score was 33. As Eric Midwinter put it, \\"here was another cricketing talent to be nurtured\\".Midwinter, p. 29. =1871= Grace had made his debut in the North v South match in 1870 but without much success. Although this fixture did not quite equal Gentlemen v Players in terms of prestige, it was nevertheless the standout event in the pre-international programme because, in theory, it featured all of the best players in England as they were chosen on technical ability alone, not on status. Grace and WG won the game for the South at Lord's in May 1871 when they shared a fourth wicket partnership of 170. WG scored 178, Grace 83 and the next best was 22 by Harry Jupp in a total of 328 which was enough for the South to win by an innings and 49 runs (Grace did not bowl).South v North, Lord's, 1871 ‚Äì scorecard =Controversies= There was always controversy surrounding Grace's elder brothers EM and WG about the money they, as nominal amateurs, made from cricket. Grace himself was once barred from a Gentlemen v Players match because of match fees he had claimed for appearances with the USEE.Arlott, p. 6.Midwinter, p. 31. =Tour of Australia, 1873‚Äì74= The English cricket team in Australia in 1873‚Äì74 is sometimes called W. G. Grace's XI. The Melbourne Club had invited WG to form a team for the tour. There were several refusals but eventually a team including Fred Grace, Walter Gilbert, Harry Jupp, James Lillywhite, William Oscroft and James Southerton boarded the P&O; steamer Mirzapore at Southampton and sailed to Melbourne where they received a rapturous welcome. Then it all turned sour.Major, p. 223. =Grace and the 1880 Australian tour= In the aftermath of the Sydney Riot of 1879, cricketing relations between England and Australia were strained and the 1880 Australian tourists had difficulty arranging fixtures. The establishment at Lord's, spearheaded by Lord Harris, had effectively embargoed them and they only played four first-class matches from May to August but many more against local club teams.Australia in British Isles 1880 They were most welcome in the north of England but one southern player who had faith in them was Fred Grace. Operating on a freelance basis for a match fee, he played against the Australians in their opening match for a club team in Southampton and then for three others in Manchester, Northampton and Harrogate.Miscellaneous matches played by Fred Grace Importantly for the Australians, Grace was a go-between from them to WG who, in the words of Malcolm Knox, \\"did not belong to (any Lord's) clique\\". WG, as always, was pragmatically alert to financial opportunity and offered them a match against Gloucestershire. This broke the Lord's embargo and Harris soon relented.Knox, pp. 67‚Äì68. The Gloucestershire v Australians match took place Monday, 2 to Wednesday, 3 August at the Clifton College Close Ground and the Australians won by 68 runs. All the Grace brothers and Billy Midwinter played for Gloucestershire but, with eleven wickets, Fred Spofforth won the game for the Australians.Gloucestershire v Australians 1880 ‚Äì scorecard It was a big match both on the day and in terms of its legacy. Knox says that Gloucestershire treated it \\"as an international\\" and a huge crowd attended. In the longer term, it convinced first the Graces and then Harris that international cricket was the way forward and negotiations began to ensure that such a match took place that summer.Knox, p. 74. Grace was selected along with EM and WG to play for England at The Oval. The match was played Monday, 6 to Wednesday, 8 September and was later recognised as the inaugural Test in England. Grace was out for nought in both innings and so became, albeit retrospectively, the first player to be dismissed for a pair on Test debut.England v Australia 1880 ‚Äì scorecard He made his mark on the match by holding a celebrated, and possibly match- winning, catch on the boundary in front of the gasometer at the Vauxhall End. This was from a shot by the giant Australian batsman George Bonnor off Alfred Shaw. Bonnor hit the ball so high that he and his partner Harry Boyle had turned for their third run before, finally, the ball came down to Grace who had positioned himself perfectly to catch it cleanly.Rae, p. 250. That catch became part of cricket's folklore and has been described as \\"the most famous deep field catch in history\\". Death The Gloucestershire team in 1880 shortly before Fred Grace's untimely death. Fred Grace (hooped cap) is third left in rear group. W. G. Grace is seated front left centre. Billy Midwinter (directly behind WG) is fourth left in rear (next to Fred). E. M. Grace (bearded) is sixth left in rear. The Test match ended with an England victory on Wednesday, 8 September. Grace went to Stroud for a USEE \\"odds\\" match played 9 to 11 September. It was his last cricket match. He had caught a cold during the Test match which was made worse by being soaked twice during showers at Stroud. He returned home to Downend to try and recuperate but still had the cold on Tuesday, 14 September, when he travelled by train to Basingstoke as he was due to play in a benefit match at Winchester the following day. He took a room at the Red Lion Hotel in Basingstoke. He could not play in the benefit match because his condition had worsened and he became bed-ridden at the hotel where a doctor diagnosed a problem with his right lung. Grace's brother Henry and his cousin Walter Gilbert came to see him, Gilbert remaining with him throughout his illness. There were conflicting reports by telegram about his condition until the morning of Wednesday, 22 September, when he suddenly deteriorated and became critical. Several family members, including WG, set off for Basingstoke but Grace died at 13:15 that day. WG and Henry were told while awaiting a train at Bradford-on-Avon railway station.Rae, p. 256. The cause of death, though given as \\"congestion of the lungs\\", was pneumonia. Grace was buried in the cemetery at Downend and an estimated 3,000 people followed his coffin. The Australians wore black armbands during their last match which began on the day of the funeral. The Times wrote: \\"His manly and straightforward conduct and genial manners won him not only popularity, but the esteem of hosts and friends\\".Rae, p. 257. It has been alleged that Grace's illness developed \\"after sleeping in a damp hotel bed\\". Gilbert, who stayed at the hotel for several days, later wrote to The Daily Telegraph: \\"It having come to my knowledge there is a rumour abroad that Mr. G. F. Grace's fatal illness was caused by sleeping in a damp bed at the Red Lion Hotel, Basingstoke, I beg to contradict it. He had a bad cold before he left home, and on my arrival at Basingstoke he told me that he had received another chill whilst waiting at Reading Station. By inserting this you will greatly oblige me, and also do justice to the members of a family whose attention and kindness to my cousin all through his illness could not have been surpassed had he been at home\\". The \\"damp bed\\" story is refuted by evidence to the contrary, as described above, because Grace's illness began with the cold he caught during the match at The Oval and he was already ill when he arrived in Basingstoke.Rae, pp. 256‚Äì257. Legacy As a team, Gloucestershire declined in the 1880s following its heady success in the 1870s and one of the stated reasons for this was Fred Grace's early death, there being a view that \\"the county was never quite the same without him\\".Birley, p. 132. Writing about the Graces in Barclays World of Cricket, Ronald Mason said of Fred that he \\"is visible only as through a glass darkly, as after a youth of great promise and pride he was smitten with sudden illness and died (aged only 29)\\".Barclays, pp. 13‚Äì14. Fred Grace was unquestionably a top-class cricketer through the 1870s but, like everyone else, he was overshadowed by WG, to whom he was especially close. Bernard Darwin wrote that Fred was the sibling (they were in a family of nine) to whom WG \\"was most devoted\\" and Fred's death created a \\"real and permanent gap\\" in WG's life.Darwin, p. 62. In his classic work, Beyond a Boundary, C. L. R. James observed that the three Grace brothers were a \\"clan\\", unlike other sets of cricketing brothers. James concluded that WG was \\"close enough\\" to EM but he felt the death of Fred more than other bereavements. The brothers were linked together but they were three individuals and, in character terms, there was polarity between EM and Fred with WG in between. EM, says James, \\"was a card\\" but Fred was \\"thoughtful and reserved\\".James, p. 233.

A crux gemmata (Latin for jewelled cross) is a form of cross typical of Early Christian and Early Medieval art, where the cross, or at least its front side, is principally decorated with jewels. In an actual cross, rather than a painted image of one, the reverse side often has engraved images of the Crucifixion of Jesus or other subjects.As on the Cross of Lothair. The Cross of Justin II has silver repouss√© figures on the reverse. Examples in metalwork are the Cross of Justin II (6th century, in the Vatican Museums), the 'crumpled cross' in the Staffordshire Hoard (8th century), the Cross of Lothair (10th century, Aachen Cathedral Treasury), the Iberian Cross of the Angels and Victory Cross, and the Cross of Cong (1120s?, National Museum of Ireland). History of use In the Late Antique and Early Medieval periods, many objects of great significance, such as reliquaries, were studded with jewels in a style that in recent centuries has been restricted to crowns and other coronation regalia and small pieces of jewellery. In the case of the cross, such decorative embellishment was especially common, and the jewelled cross is a specific type that was represented in paint, mosaic, carved ivory and other media. The cross very often has splayed ends to its arms, but the proportions of the vertical axis to the horizontal one depends entirely on the needs of the composition, and varies greatly. Pendilia, or hanging jewels or ornaments, may hang from the arms, especially the letters alpha and omega shaped in gold. The motif is first seen in a sarcophagus fragment from the late 4th century; the splayed ends of the arms are present from the earliest examples.Hellemo, 100-101. Lateran sarcophagus number 106 is the earliest work. The front side of the Cross of Lothair (ca. 1000 AD) In depictions of the cross, such as that in the mosaic in Santa Pudenziana, Rome (384‚Äì9), the jewelled cross stands on a hill or mound with a backdrop of a panoramic view representing Jerusalem, with the cross itself representing the New Jerusalem or \\"heavenly city\\".Syndicus, 104 and 139‚Äì140 The jewelled cross also served as a symbol of the Christian version of the Tree of Life, especially when the arms are shown putting out shoots from their corners. The Staffordshire Hoard 'crumpled cross' has vine leaves showing at the corners and represents Jesus the vine. It is sometimes shown on a mound representing paradise, with four rivers flowing down it (the four rivers were understood as representing the Four Gospels);Syndicus, 104; see Hellemo 93, note for an example of the four rivers symbolism. a stepped base represents the hill in actual crosses or more confined depictions. The link of the cross generally with the Tree of Life appears frequently in the hymns of Venantius Fortunatus.Wernher, 37 Sharp (2016) has shown the interlace on the front of the Staffordshire Hoard cross corresponds with the river or tree of life described in Revelation 22. 1-2. The use of large jewelled crosses as processional and military crosses stems from the victory of Constantine over his rival Maxentius at the Battle of the Milvian Bridge outside Rome in 312 AD. The vision of Constantine led to his having a large golden gem-studded processional cross made and the adoption of the cross as a standard by Christian armies. For much of the period, a large jewelled cross is recorded as decorating the presumed site of the Crucifixion, around which the Church of the Holy Sepulchre had been built. It was presented by the Eastern Emperor Theodosius II (reigned 408‚Äì450).Friesen, 10; Wernher, 36 has further details The Empress Helena, mother of Constantine in the early 4th century allegedly discovered part of the True Cross, at a time when interest in the cross was increasing, in part due to its use as a standard by the Roman Army under Constantine her son. The paradox whereby the instrument of execution is rendered the vehicle of Christ's triumph in the Resurrection remains to the present day a central theme in Christian devotion, and the jewelled cross was one of its first visual manifestations.Friesen, 10 Although it is clear that the cross was associated with Christians from a very early period, and the sign of the cross was made by Christians, it is rarely seen in the earliest Christian art, such as that in the Catacombs of Rome, where there are only about 20 crosses, though the anchor, which appears more commonly, was a disguised cross symbol.Syndicus, 103‚Äì104 There was resistance to representations of the cross with the body of Christ on it, a practice that did not begin until the 5th century, becoming more common in the 6th.Syndicus, 106‚Äì108 One of the earliest representations of a Crucifixion scene rather oddly shows the three crosses of the gospel accounts, with the two thieves hanging in place on theirs, but with Christ standing at the foot of his. The fierce Christological disputes of the period saw the Monophysites, who rejected the human nature of Christ, objecting to the depiction of his body on the cross, and this influenced the use of the empty cross, especially in Byzantine-controlled areas such as Ravenna, where several of the Emperors had Monophysite sympathies. It was the Nestorians, another heretical force of the opposite persuasion, who helped to popularize images of Christ on the cross.Syndicus, 108 and 145-6 In so-called \\"mystical\\" images, such as the apse mosaic at the Basilica of Sant' Apollinare in Classe, Ravenna (549), the jewelled cross stands specifically as a symbol for Christ.See Syndicus, 139‚Äì140 and Schiller, I, 148 for slightly different interpretations in detail A poem by St Paulinus of Nola allows a reconstruction of a mosaic apse he had (as bishop) commissioned in the basilica of St Felix of Nola at Cimitile in the early 5th century.Much of the basilica survives, but not the decorations. The whole Trinity was shown, represented by a Hand of God for God the Father at the top, above a large crux gemmata with stars in a circular frame, so very similar to Sant' Apollinare in Classe, and below that a dove for the Holy Spirit. At the bottom of the semi-dome were twelve lambs, six on each side, with a haloed Lamb of God on a raised hillock in the centre, looking up. The bottom of the mosaic at Santa Pudenziana in Rome originally also had a bottom level with this.Syndicus, 138-9, with drawing reconstructing the Nola apse. For much more detail, see Hellemo, 90ff solidus of Marcian, 450‚Äì457. The crux gemmata is commonly seen on coins, often held by a figure of Victory, especially in the Eastern Empire.See Hellemo, 98-101 for the interplay between imperial imagery of victory and the earliest images of the cross Another common Byzantine coin type shows a cross with a stepped base, which should be understood as a crux gemmata even though scale does not normally allow any indication of gems. Victory Cross at the reverse of the Curmsun Disc, Wolin, 980s Contrary to the assertion of Dan Brown in The Da Vinci Code,Chapter 4. it is not especially typical for a cross to have thirteen gems, though when one does, it probably does symbolize Jesus Christ and his Twelve Apostles. The apse mosaic in the Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls (c. 1220) has an example with thirteen jewels, but examples from the first millennium generally have more. It is not usual to use the term \\"crux gemmata\\" for crosses from more recent periods, especially for small crosses that fall under the category of jewellery.

Corporate history  The company was founded by Peter J. Walker in 1936 in London, and was initially called S.P. Fidelity Sound Systems. In 1936 the name was changed to the Acoustical Manufacturing Co. Ltd. The company moved from London to Huntingdon in 1941 after being bombed out of London in World War II. The company initially produced only public address equipment but after the war they began to produce equipment designed for use in the home as a result of the rising demand for high quality domestic sound reproduction. Within a few years the company had transitioned almost entirely to manufacturing models for the home audio market. Peter Walker was quoted in December 1975 in ‚ÄòWireless World‚Äô magazine, \\"An audio power amplifier is required to produce an output signal that differs from the input signal in magnitude only. It must therefore have occurred to every circuit designer that it should be a simple matter to take a portion of the output, compare it with the input to derive an error signal. It is then only necessary to amplify the error signal and add it to the output in the correct amplitude and phase to cancel completely the distortion of the primary amplifier.\\" Peter put this principle into practice using two amplifiers per channel instead of one. The first stage ‚Äòerror‚Äô amplifier is low powered but very high quality. The second amplifier is high powered, but of lesser audio high quality. (It‚Äôs a lot more difficult to achieve very low distortion in high powered amplifier stages). Peter designed a way to compare the high powered output with the original audio input and derive the required error correction signal which is then injected into the audio path, in such a way that the high power audio output achieves a very low distortion figure, even at very high power levels. This innovative product earned Quad the Queen‚Äôs Award for Technological Achievement in 1978. Peter Walker was also attributed with the famous hifi quote \\"the perfect amplifier is a straight wire with gain\\" --- the implication being that nothing would be added, and nothing taken away from the signal, just a bigger version of the same thing at one end. It was an aim, a goal, a description of the perfect amplifier - nobody, including Mr. Walker, ever said they'd attained that goal, and even if they did, the chances were that they were severely handicapped by their test equipment at the time. The name \\"QUAD\\" is an acronym for \\"Quality Unit Amplifier Domestic\\", used to describe the QUAD I amplifier. In 1983, when having become known for their QUAD range of products, the Acoustical Manufacturing Co. Ltd changed its name to QUAD Electroacoustics Ltd. In 1995, QUAD Electroacoustics Ltd was bought by Verity Group plc, joining its existing brands of Wharfedale and Mission. A few changes were made, including shifting all production to Shenzhen, China.CHINA: Behind the scenes at IAG  whathifi.com In September 1997 the company changed ownership again as Verity Group sold off businesses to finance its development of flat panel loudspeakers. With Wharfedale it became part of the International Audio Group under the management of Bernard and Michael Chang. Since Walker's death in 2003, the firm has had only its design ethos‚Äî\\"the closest approach to the original sound\\"‚Äîin common with the British hi-fi firm he founded in 1936.Wharfedale Achromatic WA-S1 Speaker System  Home Theater In 2003, a book was commissioned \\"QUAD The Closest Approach\\" which offered a history of the company from its creation to that point. The company's founder, Peter J. Walker, died in 2003 at the age of 87. He had retired in the late 1980s, then turning management over to his son Ross Walker.  Audio products  The company's first products were released in 1948. The QA12 and QA12/P were low- powered mono valve designs. This unit's sound quality reproduction was high compared with other products on the market at the time, and was thus adopted for use by the BBC. =Amplification= Quad 33 pre-amp Quad II power amplifier Following the mass production of 'stereo' vinyl records in 1958, the QC 22 control unit was developed and released in 1959. This was a stereo control unit that was designed to be used with a pair of QUAD II mono power amplifiers. To complement the QUAD II, the company also produced AM and FM tuners for use with the QC II & 22 control units. The company made the transition to transistor-powered models in 1966 with the \\"professional\\" QUAD 50 monoblock which had a tapped transformer output and in 1967 the consumer Quad 33 preamplifier and 303 stereo power amplifier combination. ;Control Unit ‚Äì Pre Amplifiers Quad 33 ‚Äì 1967 to 1982 ‚Äì 120,000 units Quad 34 ‚Äì 1982 to 1995 ‚Äì 41,000 units Quad 44 ‚Äì 1979 to 1989 ‚Äì 40,000 units Quad 66 ‚Äì 1986 to 1997 ‚Äì 12,000 units Quad 99 - 1999 to 2002 ;Stereo Power Amplifier Quad 303 ‚Äì 1967 to 1985 ‚Äì 94,000 units ;Monobloc Power Amplifier Quad 50E - 1966 to 1983 - 12,000 units ;Current Dumping Power Amplifiers Quad 405 ‚Äì 1975 to 1982 ‚Äì 64,000 units Quad 405‚Äì2 1982 to 1993 ‚Äì 100,000 units Quad 306 ‚Äì 1986 to 1995 ‚Äì 25,000 units Quad 606 ‚Äì 1986 to 1997 ‚Äì 27,700 units Quad 707 - 1997 to 1999 Quad 909 - 1999 to 2002 ;Integrated Amplifier Quad 77 - 1994 to 1999 =Loudspeakers= Quad electrostatic speaker In late 1949 (or early 1950), the company launched the CR corner ribbon loudspeaker. This used a Goodmans Axiom 150 cone loudspeaker for the lower frequencies and an electromagnetic ribbon loudspeaker, designed by Acoustical, for the higher frequencies. Fewer than one thousand units were sold. In 1957, they released the Quad Electrostatic Loudspeaker (ESL), the first production full frequency range electrostatic loudspeaker renowned for sonic transparency and very low distortion. Its sonic neutrality and transparency were offset by its extreme directionality, moderate power handling, the need for a large room, and moderate bass extension; its novel electrical characteristics could render some amplifiers unstable, which could result in damage to either or both. The ESL was quickly adopted by the BBC for monitoring the sound quality of their broadcasts. The BBC eventually replaced them with moving coil based monitor speakers developed by several manufacturers, such as the highly successful LS3/5A, that were more easily transported and stored, and were more representative of typical contemporary hi-fi speakers. Quad launched ESL-63, successor to the original ESL, in 1981. The newer design featured larger panels and an innovative stator design, made up of eight concentric rings fed from the centre outwards through analogue delay lines, so that the audio signal radiated out as though emanating from a single point. Subsequent electrostatic models, the 988/989, the 2805/2905 and then the 2812/2912 were successive refinements of the ESL-63 design, featuring increased power handling and output levels, more sophisticated overload protection, and greater structural rigidity. A Quad L-ite satellite speaker provides the audio for a concert at home. Following the Verity acquisition, Quad developed and market a range of conventional electrodynamic loudspeakers alongside its electrostatic line, available in both passive and active (i.e. featuring in- box amplification) configurations. All of Quad's products, including the Quad Electrostatic Loudspeaker (ESL-57), are still serviced by the Company's Service Department in Huntingdon.

Facts The minority of the Free Church, which had refused to join the union, quickly tested its legality. They issued a summons claiming that, in altering the principles of the Free Church, the majority had forfeited the right to its assets, which should belong to the remaining minority, who were the true ‚ÄòFree Church‚Äô. However, the case was lost in the Court of Session where Alexander Low, Lord Low (upheld by the second division) ruled that the Assembly of the original Free Church had a right, within limits, to change its position. The Free Church was represented by their former Moderator, Very Rev Colin Bannatyne. Their position was opposed by Lord Overtoun, hence Bannatyne v Overtoun. Judgment An appeal to House of Lords, (not delivered until August 1, 1904 due to a judicial death), reversed the Court of Session's decision (by a majority of 5-2) and found the minority was entitled to the assets of the Free Church. It was held that, by adopting new standards of doctrine (and particularly by abandoning its commitment to ‚Äòthe establishment principle‚Äô, which was held to be fundamental to the Free Church), the majority had violated the conditions on which the property of the Free Church was held. Significance The judgement had huge implications; seemingly, it deprived the Free Church element of the U.F. Church of all assets-churches, manses, colleges, missions, and even provision for elderly clergy. It handed large amounts of property to the remnant, more than it could make effective use of. A conference, held in September 1904, between representatives of the U.F.C. and the (now distinct) Free Church to come to some working arrangement, found that no basis for agreement could be reached. A convocation of the U.F. Church, held on December 15, decided that the union should proceed and resolved to pursue every lawful means to restore their assets. As a result, the intervention of Parliament was sought. A parliamentary commission was appointed, consisting of Lord Elgin, Lord Kinnear and Sir Ralph Anstruther. The question of interim possession was referred to Sir John Cheyne. The commission sat in public, and after hearing both sides, issued their report in April 1905. They stated that mutual ill- feelings made their work difficult. They concluded, however, that the Free Church was in many respects unable to carry out the purposes of the trusts, which, under the ruling of the House of Lords, was a condition of their holding the property. They recommended that an executive commission should be set up by Act of Parliament, in which the whole property of the Free Church, as at the date of the union, should be vested, and which should allocate it to the United Free Church, where the Free Church was unable to carry out the trust purposes. The Churches (Scotland) Act 1905, which gave effect to these recommendations, was passed in August. The commissioners appointed were those on whose report the act was formed, plus two others. The allocation of churches and manses was a slow business, but by 1908 over 100 churches had been assigned to the Free Church. Some of the dispossessed U.F. Church congregations, most of them in the Highlands, found shelter for a time in the parish churches; but it was early decided that, in spite of objections to erecting additional church buildings, in districts where many were now standing empty, 60 new churches and manses should at once be built at a cost of about ¬£150,000. In October 1906 the commission intimated that the Assembly Hall and the New College Buildings were to belong to the U.F. Church while the Free Church received the offices in Edinburgh and a tenement to be converted into a college, while the library was to be vested in the U. F. Church, but open to members of both. After having held its Assembly in university class- rooms for two years, and in another hall in 1905, in 1906 the U.F. Church again occupied the historic buildings of the Free Church. All the foreign missions and all the continental stations were also adjudged to the United Free Church. (Incidentally, the same act also provided for the relaxation of subscription to the Westminster Confession in the Church of Scotland; thus Parliament, had involved itself in the affairs of all Presbyterian churches.)

Hove railway station serves Hove in the county of East Sussex, England. It is measured from . The station and the majority of trains serving it are operated by Southern. The only other operator is Great Western Railway, which provides a limited number of services each day towards Wales and the West Country. Gatwick Express trains stable at Hove from time to time. It is the closest railway station to the County Cricket Ground, Hove where Sussex CCC play matches.  History  The original Hove railway station, situated further to the east, opened on 11 May 1840 by the London and Brighton Railway, on its line from Brighton to Shoreham-by-Sea, designed by the architect David Mocatta. It closed on 1 March 1880, and the site became part of Holland Road Goods Depot.'Body, Geoffrey (1989). Railways of the Southern Region. Patrick Stephens. A wooden halt named Holland Road Halt was also opened a short distance to the west in 1905, served by local trains towards Worthing and on the branch line to Devil's Dyke. This closed in 1956, and no trace now remains of its platforms.Mitchell, Vic and Smith, Keith (1983). South Coast Railways - Brighton to Worthing. Middleton Press. The present Hove station was opened on 1 October 1865. It was originally named Cliftonville, then West Brighton, before being renamed Hove and West Brighton in 1894 and finally Hove in 1895.  Station architecture  The original station building, dating from the station's opening in 1865, is on the south side of the line and to the east of the present ticket office and concourse, being separated from this by a long footbridge (a public right of way) linking the residential roads of Goldstone Villas and Hove Park Villas. The section of road on which the original building stands is called Station Approach. It is currently in commercial use. The design is very similar to that of the buildings still in use at West Worthing, Shoreham-by-Sea, Portslade and London Road stations, and the former Kemp Town station in Brighton. In 1893, coinciding with the first renaming, a new building was provided to the west. This contains the current ticket office and other station facilities. A large steel and glass porte-cochere stands outside at an angle, sheltering the taxi rank, forecourt and entrance area. This was moved from London Victoria following rebuilding works there which had rendered it redundant. The island platform is reached by subway; access from the footbridge between the old and new buildings is no longer possible, as the stairs from it are locked out of use. This platform has a modest building incorporating a caf√©, staff accommodation and waiting room, with a separate toilet block. A wide canopy runs for most of the length of the platform.  Future developments  In 2007, a Department for Transport white paper on the Thameslink Programme contained proposals to extend the Thameslink network to various additional routes in southern England; one of these would have been the section of the West Coastway line between Hove and Littlehampton, with services running via the Cliftonville Curve from the Brighton Main Line. Two trains per peak hour have been extended from London Bridge to Bedford from 20 May 2018 and an extra service will join in December 2018 Layout There are three platforms- Platforms 1 and 2 can be (and are) used for any combination of arrival or departure. Platform 3 cannot be used for arrivals from the West Coastway or departures towards London in the up direction.  Services  The station is situated a short distance west of the junction between the West Coastway line from Brighton and the Cliftonville Curve, which connects the West Coastway route with the Brighton Main Line. As a result, the station is often used for interchange between Brighton trains and those running to and from London Victoria via the Brighton Main Line. An island platform allows straightforward cross-platform interchange. A separate side platform, with direct access to the station concourse and exit, is used for westbound services. The typical off-peak service pattern is as follows: =Eastbound= *6tph to *2tph to =Westbound= *1tph to *3tpd Thameslink to Littlehampton *1tph to *2tph to *2tph to West Worthing *2tpd to via , and , one of which continues to via , and .

The NLR is currently ranked among the world‚Äôs major libraries. It has the second richest library collection in the Russian Federation, a treasury of national heritage, and is the All-Russian Information, Research and Cultural Center. Over the course of its history, the Library has aimed for comprehensive acquisition of the national printed output and has provided free access to its collections. It should not be confused with the Russian State Library, located in Moscow.  History  = Establishment = The Imperial Public Library was established in 1795 by Catherine the Great. It was based on the Za≈Çuski Library, the famous Polish national library built by Bishop Za≈Çuski in Warsaw, which had been seized by the Russians in 1794 after the Partitions of Poland.Stuart (1989) p 201 The idea of a public library in Russia emerged in the early 18th century–ò–º–ø–µ—Ä–∞—Ç–æ—Ä—Å–∫–∞—è –ü—É–±–ª–∏—á–Ω–∞—è –±–∏–±–ª–∏–æ—Ç–µ–∫–∞ –∑–∞ —Å—Ç–æ –ª–µ—Ç [A Hundred Years of Imperial Public Library], 1814‚Äì1914.

The plan of a Russian public library was submitted to Catherine in 1766 but the Empress did not approve the project for the imperial library until , eighteen months before her death. A site for the building was found at the corner of Nevsky Avenue and Sadovaya Street, right in the center of the Russian Imperial capital. The construction work began immediately and lasted for almost fifteen years. The building was designed in a Neoclassical style by architect Yegor Sokolov (built between 1796‚Äì1801). The cornerstone of the foreign-language department came from the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in the form of Za≈Çuski's Library (420,000 volumes), seized in part by the Russian government at the time of the partitions, though many volumes were lost en route to theft by Russian soldiers who sold them for profit.–ú–∞–ª—ã–π —ç–Ω—Ü–∏–∫–ª–æ–ø–µ–¥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π —Å–ª–æ–≤–∞—Ä—å –ë—Ä–æ–∫–≥–∞—É–∑–∞ –∏ –ï—Ñ—Ä–æ–Ω–∞, published in the Imperial Russia in the early 1900s The Polish-language books from the library (numbering some 55,000 titles) were returned to Poland by the Russian SFSR in 1921.Great Soviet Encyclopedia, 3rd. edition For five years after its foundation, the library was run by Comte Marie-Gabriel-Florent-Auguste de Choiseul-Gouffier.

The Library was to be opened for the public in 1812 but, as the more valuable collections had to be evacuated because of Napoleon‚Äôs invasion, the inauguration was postponed for two years. Under Count Alexander Stroganov, who managed the library during the first decade of the 19th century, the Rossica project was inaugurated, a vast collection of foreign books touching on Russia. It was Stroganov who secured for the library some of its most invaluable treasures, namely the Ostromir Gospel, the earliest book written in the Old East Slavic dialect of Church Slavonic (which was to eventually develop into the Russian language), and the Hypatian Codex of the Russian Primary Chronicle. He, along with other bibliophiles, also reviewed the collection of manuscripts and letters brought by Peter P. Dubrowsky (1754-1816) who had stayed in the diplomatic service for more than 20 years outside the fatherland. Based on the review, Stroganov recommended to Alexander I the creation of a manuscript depot. Alexander decreed the creation of such a department on February 27, 1805, and named Dubrowsky as the first keeper of the depot of manuscripts. = 1814‚Äì1917 = The Neoclassical building on the Nevsky Avenue. The Imperial Public Library was inaugurated on in the presence of Gavrila Derzhavin and Ivan Krylov. Over 100 thousand titles were issued to the visitors in the first three decades, and the second Library building (designed by Carlo Rossi) facing the Catherine Garden was erected between 1832-1835 to accommodate the growing collections. The library's third, and arguably most famous, director was Aleksey Olenin (1763‚Äì1843). His 32-year tenure at the helm, with Sergey Uvarov serving as his deputy, raised the profile of the library among Russian intellectuals. The library staff included prominent men of letters and scholars like Ivan Krylov, Konstantin Batyushkov, Nikolay Gnedich, Anton Delvig, Mikhail Zagoskin, Alexander Vostokov, and Father Ioakinf, to name but a few. Librarianship progressed to a new level in the 1850s. The reader community grew several times, enlarged by common people. At the same time, many gifts of books were offered to the library. Consequently, collection growth rates in the 1850s were five times higher than the annual growth rate of five thousand new acquired during the first part of the century. In 1859, Vasily Sobolshchikov prepared the first national manual of library science for the library entitled Public Library Facilities and Cataloguing.–°–æ–±–æ–ª—å—â–∏–∫–æ–≤ –í.–ò. –û–± —É—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–π—Å—Ç–≤–µ –æ–±—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö –±–∏–±–ª–∏–æ—Ç–µ–∫ –∏ —Å–æ—Å—Ç–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏–∏ –∏—Ö –∫–∞—Ç–∞–ª–æ–≥–æ–≤ [Sobolshikov V.I. Public library structure and cataloguing]. SPb., 1859. 6, 56 p. By 1864, the Public Library held almost 90 per cent of all Russian printed output. The influx of new visitors required a larger reading room in the new building closing the library court along the perimeter (designed by Sobolshchikov, built in 1860‚Äî62). The visitors were offered such novelties as continuous reading room service by library staff members, a reference desk, printed catalogues and guide books, lists of new acquisitions, and longer hours of service in the reading room (10 a.m. to 9 p.m). The new building on the Moskovsky Avenue An avalanche-like growth of attendance persisted in the second part of the 19th century. Library cards and attendance grew tenfold between 1860 and 1913. The public principle triumphed when the class barriers maintained until the mid-19th century were abolished and the petty bourgeois, peasants and even women were often seen among the visitors. Women were also employed by the Library but only as volunteer members rather than formal staff. From 1849 to 1861 the library was managed by Count Modest von Korff (1800‚Äì76), who had been Alexander Pushkin's school- fellow at the Lyceum. Korff and his successor, Ivan Delyanov, added to the library's collections some of the earliest manuscripts of the New Testament (the Codex Sinaiticus from the 340s), the Old Testament (the so-called Leningrad Codex), and one of the earliest Qur'ans (the Uthman Qur'an from the mid-7th century). The Library‚Äôs role was adapted to changing conditions requiring close contacts with universities, scientific societies, leading research centers and major international libraries. The Public library engaged eminent scholars and cultural workers, and research groups were formed to study precious books and manuscripts. The Library continued to build a comprehensive collection of national publications. The growing collections were located in a new building (designed by E.S. Vorotilov, 1896‚Äî1901). By 1913, the Library held one million Russian books (total collections comprising three million titles), emerging as one of the world‚Äôs great libraries and the richest manuscript collection in Russia. = 20th century = In the aftermath of the Russian Revolution, the institution was placed under the management of Ernest Radlov and Nicholas Marr, although its national preeminence was relinquished to the Lenin State Library in Moscow. The library was awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labour in 1939 and remained open during the gruesome Siege of Leningrad. In 1948, the Neoclassical campus of the Catherine Institute on the Fontanka Embankment (Giacomo Quarenghi, 1804‚Äì07) was assigned to the library. By 1970, the Library contained more than 17,000,000 items. The modern building for the book depository was erected on Moskovsky Prospekt in the 1980s and 1990s. The National Library began a large-scale digitization project at the end of the 20th century. By 2012 the Library, along with its counterpart in Moscow, had around 80,000 titles available electronically. = Looting during World War II = After the end of the Second World War, millions of German art objects, books and archival materials were brought to the Soviet Union. Some of these cultural assets were returned to the former GDR in the 1950s. However, to this day, among other things, there are still more than 200,000 works of art, over four million books and archival material with a length of three shelf kilometers in German provenance in Russia.

In the 1960s, author William S. Burroughs wrote about Scientology in both fictional short stories and non-fictional essays. The topic was dealt with more directly in his book, Ali's Smile/Naked Scientology. The 2000 film Battlefield Earth was an adaptation of a novel by L. Ron Hubbard. Musicians and playwrights have made reference to Scientology on some of their work, with some pieces treating the topic in a negative light by their references, and others in a positive manner. Frank Zappa's 1979 concept album/rock opera Joe's Garage lampoons Scientology in the song \\"A Token of My Extreme\\". Scientologist Chick Corea has made reference to Scientology in his work, and two of his albums were influenced by L. Ron Hubbard novels. Maynard James Keenan of the metal band Tool, has been critical of Scientology, and the 1996 song \\"√Ünema\\" contains a negative reference to L. Ron Hubbard. Both Scientology and the life of its founder L. Ron Hubbard were addressed in the 2003 Off-Broadway musical, A Very Merry Unauthorized Children's Scientology Pageant. The play took a tongue-in- cheek look at both Hubbard's life and the history of the Church, and received an Obie Award in 2004. Scientology has also been dealt with in fictional television shows, including sitcoms, cartoons, and dramas. The 2005 South Park episode \\"Trapped in the Closet\\" dealt with Scientology, and related the story of Xenu. This episode resulted in a deal of controversy, including the departure of Isaac Hayes, and questions over why the episode was not initially rebroadcast. In season four of the television program Nip/Tuck, characters Kimber and Matt join the Church of Scientology. Issues addressed within Nip/Tuck have included both the Xenu story and a look at deprogramming. In Boston Legal's third season, character Alan Shore helps defend an employer sued for discrimination after firing a Scientologist. The episode delves into some of the employee's more eccentric beliefs as well as a debate on religious bigotry, but Shore ends up winning the case for his client. In the radio sitcom Old Harry's Game, Satan claims he invented Scientology. Fiction William S. Burroughs, who briefly dabbled with Scientology, wrote extensively about it during the late 1960s, weaving some of its jargon into his fictional works, as well as authoring non-fiction essays about it. In the end, however, he abandoned Scientology and publicly eschewed it in an editorial for the Los Angeles Free Press in 1970. Burroughs' work Ali's Smile/Naked Scientology contains many writings related to both Dianetics and L. Ron Hubbard. \\"Operation Freakout\\", also known as \\"Operation PC Freakout\\", was the name given by the Church of Scientology to a covert plan intended to have the author Paulette Cooper imprisoned or committed to a mental institution.United States of America v. Jane Kember, Morris Budlong, Sentencing Memorandum; pp. 23-25 The plan, undertaken in 1976 following years of Church-initiated lawsuits and covert harassment, was meant to eliminate the perceived threat that Cooper posed to the Church and obtain revenge for her publication in 1971 of a highly critical book, The Scandal of Scientology. The events of Operation Freakout are featured, in a thinly fictionalized form, in Giuseppe Genna's 2004 novel In the Name of Ishmael. Scientology is referred to as \\"Science Religion\\", Cooper is called \\"Paulette Rowling\\" and Mary Sue Hubbard is \\"Johanna Lewis\\". The book includes an almost word-for-word transcription of the Operation Freakout planning document of April 1, 1976, with the names of the principal figures substituted as described above. In the science-fiction setting of Count Zero, a cyberpunk novel by author William Gibson, one of the character's relatives is mentioned to be a Scientologist. L. Ron Hubbard (referred to simply as \\"Hubbard\\") is also mentioned as an option of a possible hologram that could appear over someone's bed, another choice included the Virgin Mary. Film In reviews of the 1999 film Bowfinger, some critics compared the fictional organization \\"MindHead\\" to the Church of Scientology. In the film, producer Bobby Bowfinger, played by Steve Martin, encounters difficulties involving actor Kit Ramsey, played by Eddie Murphy. Paul Clinton writes in CNN online: \\"'Bowfinger' could just be viewed as an out-there, over- the-top spoof about Hollywood, films, celebrities and even the Church of Scientology. But Martin has written a sweet story about a group of outsiders with impossible dreams.\\" Andrew O'Hehir writes in Salon that \\"Too much of 'Bowfinger' involves the filmmakers' generically wacky pursuit of the increasingly paranoid Kit, who flees into the clutches of a pseudo-Scientology outfit called MindHead (their slogan: 'Truth Through Strength').\\" The Denver Post describes the Kit Ramsey character as \\"...petulant, paranoid and pampered, like any good star, and also a devotee of a Scientology-like religion.\\" In a review in the San Francisco Chronicle, Wesley Morris describes Ramsey's organization as \\"a mock-Scientology cult called MindHead - a bit that sprung from Martin's own issues with MENSA.\\" The Albuquerque Journal describes the MindHead organization \\"a rather thinly veiled but nevertheless amusing blast at Scientology,\\" and the Fort Worth Star-Telegram characterizes it as an \\"organization that comes across as a thinly veiled send-up of Scientology.\\" Some critics perceived the 2000 film Bless the Child to be mocking Scientology because the fictionalized cult \\"The New Dawn\\" in the film mimicked Scientology's symbols and rhetoric. The following year in 2001, a film titled The Profit parodied Scientology and L. Ron Hubbard. Paul Thomas Anderson's 2012 film The Master features a religious organization called \\"The Cause\\" that has many similarities to Scientology. Also, the character of Lancaster Dodd, played by Philip Seymour Hoffman shares a physical resemblance to Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard. Two other films that feature new religious movements similar to Scientology are Schizopolis, and The L.A. Complex. Music Maynard James Keenan, in concert. Frank Zappa's 1979 concept album/rock opera Joe's Garage lampoons Scientology in the song \\"A Token of My Extreme\\". Zappa uses terminology such as \\"L.

Gary Numan had popular songs laced with Scientology references in the 1980s such as \\"Me! I Disconnect from You\\", \\"Praying to the Aliens\\", and \\"Only a Downstat\\", influenced directly by William S. Burroughs' Scientology-based writings. The progressive metal band Tool has voiced criticism of Scientology. After releasing their first full-length album Undertow in 1993, the band began touring to promote their new work. In May 1993, Tool was scheduled to play the Garden Pavilion in Hollywood but learned at the last minute that the Garden Pavilion belonged to the Church of Scientology, which the band felt clashed with \\"the band's ethics about how a person should not follow a belief system that constricts their development as a human being\\". The band's vocalist Maynard James Keenan recalled that he \\"spent most of the show baa-ing like a sheep at the audience\\". Scott Schalin reported in Bay Area Music: \\"Between songs, Keenan, staring first at the lush grounds paid for by devoted L. Ron followers and then into the eyes of his own audience, bayed into the mic like a sheep looking for his shepherd's gate. \\"Baaaaa! Baaaaa!\\" the singer bleated.\\" The lyrics to the Tool song \\"√Ünema\\" contain the phrase: \\"Fuck L. Ron Hubbard, Fuck all his clones.\\" Television An organization with similarities to Scientology, called Selfosophy, was a central part of an episode from the second season of Millennium that aired on the Fox network on November 21, 1997, entitled \\"Jose Chung's Doomsday Defense.\\" Selfosophy was created by a science fiction writer who had spent time in an insane asylum. Matt Roush of USA Today wrote that the episode was \\"written with the density of a Simpsons cartoon. You'll scream till you laugh, or laugh till you scream.\\"USA Today, Roush R., 20 November 1997 Michael Patrick Sullivan writing for Underground Online/UGO wrote: \\"After a year and a half of doom and gloom stories, one of the most astounding television writers of the nineties, Darin Morgan, is allowed his fractured take on Millennium and Frank and author Jose Chung investigate murders that lead them deeply into the world of a pseudo-religion called Selfosophy (read as Scientology). Bizarre is exactly the word for it as Millennium takes sharp aim at itself and has fun with it.\\"http://www.ugo.com/, Sullivan, M.P., 22 November 1997 In 2005, Season 9 of South Park, \\"Trapped in the Closet\\" Stan is interviewed by a member of The Church of Scientology. The member tells him that he isn't happy, but the Church can help him for a nominal fee. Later he is given a test on an E meter machine. He scores unusually high, which leads the members to believe that he is the reincarnation of L. Ron Hubbard. The next day he is confronted by the entire Church of Scientology, including Tom Cruise. Stan tells Cruise that his films are \\"okay\\" and that he's not as good as \\"the guy who played Napoleon Dynamite\\". Tom locks himself in the closet. He stays there for the entire episode and is later joined by John Travolta, and R. Kelly who speaks in song, as he does in Trapped in the Closet. Meanwhile, Stan is commissioned to finish the Writings of Scientology. One of his major changes is that he wanted to make the church free. One of the leaders of the Church reprimanded him for this. He tries to tell the rest of the church about the scam. Each individual member of the church threatens to sue him, including Tom Cruise, John Travolta, and R. Kelly, who have finally come out of the closet. In 2006, season four of Nip/Tuck, the characters Kimber and Matt join the Church, making them the first Scientologist regular characters on a prime-time TV show. In the latter part of the fourth season, Kimber has a hallucination in which Xenu appears to her. Though the Scientology \\"tech\\" and details are portrayed in a simplified way, the show is incorporating the Scientology storyline as a serious subplot, rather than a parody or a one-time jab. In the episode Dawn Budge, Matt moves out of the house after his parents pressure him to leave Scientology. Both characters eventually leave Scientology in the fifth season. In April 2015, following the recent release of Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief , Saturday Night Live aired a music video featuring the \\"Church of Neurotology\\", a parody of Scientology's 1990 music video \\"We Stand Tall\\". In Series 5 of Peep Show. Jeremy, (played by Robert Webb), and Super Hans, (played by Matt King), go into \\"The New Wellness centre\\" (a thinly disguised parody of Scientology). Their intention is to 'out-freak the freak show', or possibly just get warm. However, within hours they are giving all of their possessions to the church, renaming themselves, and indenturing themselves in perpetuity. Mark, (played by David Mitchell successfully deprogammes Jeremy and by the next episode Super Hans has also left the church. Theatre The controversy surrounding the Church of Scientology and the (new) Cult Awareness Network organization was described in the 2002 Stephen Adly Guirgis play, Jesus Hopped the \\"A\\" Train. \\"Scientologists sued the Cult Awareness Network, bankrupted them, and took over the damn Cult Awareness Network! ... Same office! Same phone number! But when you call the [expletive] up, you speaking to one of them! What kinda help you think they gonna give you?\\" The character Angel tells Mary Jane that individuals who call the Cult Awareness Network looking for help will end up speaking with a Scientologist on the other end of the phone. The play was nominated for a 2003 Laurence Olivier Theatre Award, in the category: \\"The BBC Award for Best New Play of 2002.\\" In 2003, the play A Very Merry Unauthorized Children's Scientology Pageant was produced, which described a tale of the life of L. Ron Hubbard and the Church of Scientology, told from the perspective of fictional children of Scientologists. The play won a 2004 Obie Award. Video games In the Dead Space survival horror video game the plot follows a religious cult named \\"Unitology\\", which members believe that necromorph infections are the type of rebirth. Also the leader of the cult Michael Altman has been controlling the building of the Markers, the almighty artifacts that drives human beings mad. In Grand Theft Auto V The Epsilon Program is modeled on Scientology. A small cult called the Hubologists appear in both Fallout 2 and the Nuka-World DLC of Fallout 4, offering several therapies involving increasingly larger amounts of radiation, and claims of their leader communing with aliens.

A masterpiece of city planning, it was built in stages between 1767 and around 1850, and retains much of its original neo-classical and Georgian period architecture. Its best known street is Princes Street, facing Edinburgh Castle and the Old Town across the geological depression of the former Nor Loch. Together with the Old Town, the New Town was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1995. Proposal and planning The idea of a New Town was first suggested in the late 17th century when the Duke of Albany and York (later King James VII and II), when resident Royal Commissioner at Holyrood, encouraged the idea of having an extended regality to the north of the city and a North Bridge. He gave the city a grant: > That, when they should have occasion to enlarge their city by purchasing > ground without the town, or to build bridges or arches for the accomplishing > of the same, not only were the proprietors of such lands obliged to part > with the same on reasonable terms, but when in possession thereof, they are > to be erected into a regality in favour of the citizens. It is possible that, with such patronage, the New Town may have been built many years earlier than it was but, in 1682, the Duke left the city and became King in 1685, only to lose the throne in 1688. Map of the city, showing the New Town (mid brown), the Old Town, and the West End, with the World Heritage Site indicated by the red line. The decision to construct a New Town was taken by the city fathers, after overcrowding inside the Old Town city walls reached breaking point and to prevent an exodus of wealthy citizens from the city to London.; citing pamphlet entitled 'Proposals for Carrying on Certain Public Works in the City of Edinburgh' The Age of Enlightenment had arrived in Edinburgh, and the outdated city fabric did not suit the professional and merchant classes who lived there. Lord Provost George Drummond succeeded in extending the boundary of the Royal Burgh to encompass the fields to the north of the Nor Loch, the heavily polluted body of water which occupied the valley immediately north of the city. A scheme to drain the Loch was put into action, although the process was not fully completed until 1817. Crossing points were built to access the new land; the North Bridge in 1772, and the Earthen Mound, which began as a tip for material excavated during construction of the New Town. The Mound, as it is known today, reached its present proportions in the 1830s. As the successive stages of the New Town were developed, the rich moved northwards from cramped tenements in narrow closes into grand Georgian homes on wide roads. However, the poor remained in the Old Town. The First New Town Plan for the New Town by James Craig (1768) A design competition was held in January 1766 to find a suitably modern layout for the new suburb. It was won by 26-year-old James Craig, who, following the natural contours of the land, proposed a simple axial grid, with a principal thoroughfare along the ridge linking two garden squares. Two other main roads were located downhill to the north and south with two minor streets between. Several mews off the minor streets provided stable lanes for the large homes. Completing the grid are three north-south cross streets. Craig's original plan has not survived but it has been suggested that it is indicated on a map published by John Laurie in 1766. This map shows a diagonal layout with a central square reflecting a new era of civic Hanoverian British patriotism by echoing the design of the Union Flag. Both Princes Street and Queen Street are shown as double sided. A simpler revised design reflected the same spirit in the names of its streets and civic spaces. =Street names= View of the First New Town from Edinburgh Castle, largely obscured by modern shopping developments The intended principal street was named George Street, after the king at the time, George III. Queen Street was to be located to the north, named after his wife, and St. Giles Street to the south, after the city's patron saint. St Andrew Square and St. George's Square were the names chosen to represent the union of Scotland and England. The idea was continued with the smaller Thistle Street (for Scotland's national emblem) between George Street and Queen Street, and Rose Street (for England's emblem) between George Street and Princes Street. King George rejected the name St. Giles Street, St Giles being the patron saint of lepers and also the name of a slum area or 'rookery' on the edge of the City of London. It was therefore renamed Prince's Street after his eldest son, the Prince of Wales. The name of St. George's Square was changed to Charlotte Square, after the Queen, to avoid confusion with the existing George Square on the South Side of the Old Town. The westernmost blocks of Thistle Street were renamed Hill Street and Young Street, making Thistle Street half the length of Rose Street. The three streets completing the grid, Castle, Frederick and Hanover Streets, were named for the view of the castle, King George's second son Prince Frederick, and the House of Hanover respectively. =Development= Craig's proposals hit further problems when development began. Initially the exposed new site was unpopular, leading to a ¬£20 premium being offered to the first builder on site. This was received by John Young who built Thistle Court, the first buildings in the New Town, at the east end of Thistle Street in 1767. Instead of building as a terrace as envisaged, he built a small courtyard. Doubts were overcome soon enough, and further construction started in the east with St. Andrew Square. Montage image of Robert Adam's north side of Charlotte Square. Bute House, official residence of the First Minister of Scotland, is in the centre. Craig had intended that the view along George Street be terminated by two large churches, situated at the outer edge of each square, on axis with George Street. Whilst the western church on Charlotte Square was built, at St Andrew Square the land behind the proposed church site was owned by Sir Lawrence Dundas. He decided to build a town mansion here and commissioned a design from Sir William Chambers. The resulting Palladian mansion, known as Dundas House, was completed in 1774. In 1825 it was acquired by the Royal Bank of Scotland and today is the registered office of the bank.. The forecourt of the building, with the equestrian monument to John Hope, 4th Earl of Hopetoun, occupies the proposed church site. St. Andrew's Church had to be built on a site on George Street. The lack of a visual termination at the end of this street was remedied in 1823 with William Burn's monument to Henry Dundas. Surviving Georgian buildings in Princes Street The first New Town was mainly completed by 1820, with the completion of Charlotte Square. This was built to a design by Robert Adam, and was the only architecturally unified section of the New Town. Adam also produced a design for St. George's Church, although his design was superseded by that of Robert Reid. The building, now known as West Register House, now houses part of the National Archives of Scotland. The north side of Charlotte Square features Bute House, formerly the official residence of the Secretary of State for Scotland and, since the introduction of devolution in Scotland, the official residence of the First Minister of Scotland. A few small sections remained undeveloped at the time. In 1885 an unbuilt section of Queen Street (an open garden until that time), north of St Andrew Square, provided the site for the Scottish National Portrait Gallery. To the north-west, north of Charlotte Square, the land was part of the Earl of Moray's estate and a long- running boundary dispute with the Moray Estate.Buildings of Scotland: Edinburgh, by Gifford, McWilliam and Walker caused delay in development. A section of Glenfinlas Street at the north-west corner of Charlotte Square was not completed until 1990 while the western end of Queen Street, north of Charlotte Square, has never been developed. The New Town was envisaged as a mainly residential suburb with a number of professional offices of domestic layout. It had few planned retail ground floors, however it did not take long for the commercial potential of the site to be realised. Shops were soon opened on Princes Street, and during the 19th century the majority of the townhouses on that street were replaced with larger commercial buildings. Occasional piecemeal redevelopment continues to this day, though most of Queen Street and Thistle Street, and large sections of George Street, Hanover, Frederick and Castle Streets, are still lined with their original late 18th century buildings. Northern, or Second, New Town and extensions Great King Street. Part of the northern extension to the original New Town After 1800, the success of the first New Town led to grander schemes. The 'Northern New Town' (now usually called the Second New Town) aimed to extend Edinburgh from the north of Queen Street Gardens towards the Water of Leith, with extensions to the east and west. These developments took place mostly between 1800‚Äì1830. Initial designs by William Sibbald followed the original grid orientation of Craig‚Äôs First New Town, with entire streets being built as one construction. Building continued on an extended Hanover Street, called Dundas Street and, beyond Great King Street, Pitt Street (later renamed to Dundas Street in the 1960s), almost 1 km north towards the Water of Leith at Canonmills, where Bellevue Crescent would eventually mark the most northern extent of the New Town project. Streets were laid out either side with Great King Street the central avenue terminated by Drummond Place to the east and Royal Circus to the west. Northumberland Street and Cumberland Street were lesser streets to the south and north respectively. Heriot Row and Abercromby Place, both one- sided streets at the southern limit of the development, enjoyed open aspects to Queen Street Gardens. The builder for large sections of the Second New Town was George Winton.http://www.scottisharchitects.org.uk/architect_full.php?id=408213 Moray Place. Part of the western extension to the original New Town Very large sections of the Second New Town, built from the early 19th century are also still exactly as built. Townhouses generally occupied the east-west streets, with blocks of flats (called tenements in Scotland) along the north-south streets. Shops were originally generally restricted to the lower floors of the wider north-south streets. The larger houses had service mews running behind and parallel to their terraces. The Picardy Place extension (including Broughton Street, Union Street and East London Street) was mostly finished by 1809. To the west of the original New Town, Shandwick Place, an extension of Princes Street, was started in 1805. Development of Melville Street and the area north of Shandwick Place followed in 1825. The Gayfield Estate (Gayfield Square) extension was designed in 1807 and from around 1813 the New Town gradually replaced and developed the older village of Stockbridge. The painter Henry Raeburn bought the Deanhough estate in the northwest of the New Town and started development in 1813 with Ann Street named after his wife. In 1822, the Earl of Moray had plans drawn up by James Gillespie Graham to develop his Drumsheugh estate, between Charlotte Square and the Water of Leith. This was popular amongst the Scots nobility and wealthy lawyers. The bulk of the estate was complete by 1835, but many of the corner blocks were not finally added until the 1850s. The estate is now usually called the Moray Estate. It remains one of the city's most affluent areas and of the most exclusive set of addresseshttp://www.morayfeu.com/history/ Eastern, or Third, New Town William Henry Playfair's plan for Edinburgh's Eastern New Town approved at a meeting on 27 September 1819, engraving by Wiliiam Home Lizars. Note that the orientation of the plan is with north on the left side, so Calton Hill is on the right. In order to extend the New Town eastwards, the Lord Provost, Sir John Marjoribanks, succeeded in getting the elegant Regent Bridge built.Marjoribanks,Roger (2014) \\"Edinburgh Portrait, Sir John Marjoribanks , Bart, MP (1763‚Äì1833)\\" The Book of the Edinburgh Club, Volume 10, Pp 151-156, It was completed in 1819. The bridge spanned a deep ravine with narrow inconvenient streets and made access to Calton Hill much easier and agreeable from Princes Street. Even before the bridge had been built, Edinburgh Town Council were making preparations for building the Eastern New Town, which would stretch from the slopes of Calton Hill, north to Leith, between Leith Walk and Easter Road. The Lord Provost made an agreement with the main landowners in 1811, some initial surveying was done and there was a competition for architectural plans for the development that on 1 January 1813, the results of which were inconclusive. A number of prominent architects were then asked for their opinions: William Stark, James Gillespie, Robert Burn and his son William Burn, John Paterson and Robert Reid and others.Youngson, A.J. (1966): \\"The Making of Classical Edinburgh\\", Edinburgh University Press, Edinburgh, UK, Stark's observations were particularly valued and he went on to expand them in a \\"Report to the Lord Provost, Magistrates and Council of Edinburgh on the Plans for Laying out the Grounds for Buildings between Edinburgh and Leith\\". Stark died on 9 October 1813, and his report was published posthumously in 1814. The commissioners decided to turn to Stark's pupil William Henry Playfair. He was appointed in February 1818, and produced a plan in April 1819, that closely followed Starks's recommendations. Playfair‚Äôs designs were intended to create a New Town even more magnificent than Craig's.Youngson, A.J. (2001): \\"The Companion Guide to Edinburgh and the borders\\", Chapter 9 (Calton Hill), Polygon Books, Edinburgh, UK, The Old Royal High School on Calton Hill Regent Terrace, Carlton Terrace and Royal Terrace on Calton Hill were built, also Hillside Crescent and some adjoining streets, but the development further north in the direction of Leith was never completed. On the south side of Calton Hill various monuments were erected as well as the Royal High School, designed in Greek revival style by Thomas Hamilton. Other additions Regent Terrace, part of Playfair's eastern extension of the New Town A few modest developments in Canonmills were started in the 1820s but none were completed at that time. For several decades the operations of the tannery at Silvermills inhibited development in the immediate vicinity. From the 1830s onward, development slowed but following the completion in 1831 of Thomas Telford‚Äôs Dean Bridge, the Dean Estate had some developments built. These included the Dean Orphanage (now the Dean Gallery), Daniel Stewart's College, streets to the Northeast of Queensferry Street (in the 1850s), Buckingham Terrace (in 1860) and Learmonth Terrace (in 1873). In the 19th century Edinburgh's second railway, the Edinburgh, Leith and Newhaven Railway, built a tunnel under the New Town to link Scotland Street with Canal Street (later absorbed into Waverley Station). After its closure, the tunnel was used to grow mushrooms, and during World War 2 as an air raid shelter. Principal losses Drumsheugh Gardens. Part of the further western, Victorian extension to the New Town An attempt to build an elevated walkway along the length of Princes Street involved the planned demolition of the entire street in a radical plan published in the 1960s. The plan was unpopular but before it was abandoned in 1982, seven buildings were removed. The old Boots building at 102 Princes Street, with its series of statues of William Wallace, Robert Burns, Sir Walter Scott and Robert the Bruce, was demolished in 1965. The North British & Mercantile Insurance Company building at number 64 followed. The New Club, designed by William Burn and extended by David Bryce, and the adjacent Life Association of Scotland building by David Rhind and Sir Charles Barry also came down.\\"Brutal surgery\\" - how a crackpot plan to create an 'elevated walkway' almost doomed Princes Street, BP Perry, edinburghlive, 29 April 2019 Lost streets include those in the St James Square area, demolished in the 1960s to make way for the St James Shopping Centre and offices for the Scottish Office. This mainly tenemental area, reported as having a population of 3,763, was demolished largely on the basis of being slums with only 61 of 1,100 dwellings being considered fit for habitation. Also demolished as slums was most of Jamaica Street at the west end of the Second New Town. Bellevue House by Robert Adam, which became the Excise or Custom House, was built in 1775, before the New Town extended to the Bellevue area, in what is now Drummond Place Gardens. Great King Street and London Street in the Northern or Second New Town were aligned on this building but it was demolished in the 1840s due to the construction of the Scotland Street railway tunnel below. Culture Typical New Town street lamps (in Nelson Street) The New Town is home to the National Gallery of Scotland and the Royal Scottish Academy Building, both designed by Playfair and located next to each other on The Mound. The Scottish National Portrait Gallery is on Queen Street. Other notable buildings include the Assembly Rooms on George Street, the Balmoral Hotel (formerly called the North British Hotel, after a railway company) with its landmark clock tower above Waverley Station, and the Scott Monument. The Cockburn Association (Edinburgh Civic Trust) is prominent in campaigning to preserve the architectural integrity of the New Town. Shopping The New Town contains Edinburgh's main shopping streets. Princes Street is home to many chain shops, as well as Jenners department store, an Edinburgh institution. George Street, once the financial centre, now has numerous modern bars, many occupying former banking halls, while Multrees Walk on St. Andrew Square is home to Harvey Nichols and other designer shops. The St. James Centre, at the east end of the New Town, was an indoor mall completed in 1970. Often considered an unwelcome addition to New Town architecture, it included a large branch of John Lewis. The St. James Centre (excluding John Lewis) closed on Sunday, 16 October 2016 and has been demolished. It is being redeveloped and is due to reopen in 2020 at a cost of ¬£850,000,000. Also, by the Waverley Station lies the Waverley Mall, which contains many high street stores including: Game, Costa, McDonald's, Sainsbury's, KFC, Subway, Superdry and Greggs.

In Portugal, he is commonly referred to as the O Infante Condest√°vel (\\"the Constable Prince\\").  Early life  Infante John was the son of King John I of Portugal and his wife Philippa of Lancaster. John and his brothers Edward, Peter, Henry and Ferdinand, sister Isabella and half-brother Afonso, constitute what Portuguese historians have traditionally labelled the 'illustrious generation' (√çnclita Gera√ß√£o)  Royal career  With his brothers, Infante John participated in the conquest of Ceuta (1415) and was knighted by his father in the aftermath. He was invested as the 1st Lord of Reguengos de Monsaraz, Colares and Belas shortly after. In October 1418, at the king's request, Pope Martin V approved the appointment of Infante John as the 10th Master of the Order of St. James of the Sword, bringing the old military order into the hands of the royal family.Bull of Pope Martin V appointing John master of Santiago can be found in Monumenta Henricina, vol. 2, p.301 That same year (1418), John and his brother Henry the Navigator led a relief fleet to Ceuta and helped lift the Siege of Ceuta. After the death of Nuno √Ålvares Pereira in 1431, Infante John was appointed the 3rd Constable of Portugal. As a result, John is frequently characterised by the appellation O Infante Condest√°vel (\\"The Constable Prince\\"). Infante Jo√£o was Lord of Reguengos de Monsaraz, Belas and Colares. After King John I's death in 1433, John's eldest brother ascended the throne as king Edward of Portugal. In 1437, Infante John joined another brother Peter, Duke of Coimbra, in arguing against a projected Portuguese expedition to seize Tangier that led to the Battle of Tangier. The campaign ended in disaster. After the Tangier fiasco, John urged the ratification of a treaty with Marinid Morocco that called for the relinquishment of Ceuta in exchange for his captive brother Ferdinand the Holy Prince. The Cortes refused, and Ferdinand was left to die in captivity.  Duke of Coimbra Rebellion  King Edward died in September 1438, leaving a young son to ascend the throne as king Afonso V of Portugal under the regency of his widow Eleanor of Aragon. This was an unpopular arrangement among the common people of the country, who feared Eleanor would be a puppet of the high nobility who sought to recover the political privileges they lost during the revolution of the 1380s. The prospect of civil war raised its head. To forestall a rebellion, Infante John quickly seized control of Lisbon and oversaw the assembly of a burgher-packed Cortes to elect his brother Peter of Coimbra as regent for his nephew Afonso V. The high nobility, led by his half- brother Afonso of Barcelos, urged Eleanor to hold fast, and a tense power- sharing regency arrangement was agreed upon between Peter and Eleanor. Peter of Coimbra relied on his close alliance with Infante John to secure the lion's share of power during the first few years of the regency. Infante John's sudden death in October 1442 was a terrible blow to Peter, who thereafter found it increasingly difficult to fend off the aspirations of his half- brother Afonso of Barcelos. Sepulcher of Infante John and Isabella of Barcelos in Batalha Monastery Regent Peter appointed John's son Diogo of Portugal to succeed his father as Master of the Order of Santiago and Constable of Portugal.  Marriage and Issue  In 1424, John married his half-niece Isabella of Barcelos, daughter of his half-brother Afonso of Barcelos. The couple had four children: *Infante Diogo of Portugal (1425‚Äì1443) ‚Äì 4th Constable of Portugal and 11th Master of the Order of St. James; without issue. *Infanta Isabella of Portugal (1428‚Äì1496), married John II of Castile, mother of Isabella I of Spain. *Infanta Beatrice of Portugal (1430‚Äì1506), married Infante Ferdinand, Duke of Viseu, mother of Manuel I of Portugal. *Infanta Phillipa of Portugal (1432‚Äì1444), Lady of Almada.

They opened their alpine home as a ministry to curious travellers and as a forum to discuss philosophical and religious beliefs. Today, L'Abri houses in various parts of the world continue to offer people a place to stay when they travel.  Development of L'Abri  Schaeffer became an evangelical Christian as a teenager. In 1947, Francis and Edith moved to Switzerland to work as missionaries for the Independent Board for Presbyterian Foreign Missions (IBPFM) in Europe.Burson and Walls, p. 40.Hankins, p. 28. Following a spiritual crisis in 1951, and disagreements with theologians such as Carl McIntire, Schaeffer and his wife left IBPFM in 1955, to pursue their dream of working with young people.Hankins, p. 51. They moved to Hu√©moz, where they established L'Abri, without assurance that it would be successful.Hankins, p. 56. Word-of-mouth soon led to an increasing stream of visitors, with one period in the summer of 1956 averaging 31 visitors per week.Hankins, p. 57. International distribution of tapes of Schaeffer's lectures also helped to raise awareness of Schaeffer's work.Hankins, p. 59. As it grew, the L'Abri organisation came to own and operate several buildings in Hu√©moz.Hankins, p. 58. It came to include four kinds of people: short-term guests; students, who divided their time between study and communal work; workers, who participated in discussions and the work of hospitality; and members, who were part of the decision-making process. Schaeffer died in 1984,Burson and Walls, p. 14. but the ministry he founded has continued to grow. Now, L'Abri has operations in a number of different countries, each staffed by workers who encourage visitors to study and consider their religious and philosophical beliefs. As of 2011, L'Abri has residential \\"Study Centres\\" in the United States (Minnesota and Massachusetts), Canada, South Korea, Australia, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Sweden, as well as the original centre in Switzerland. It also has non-residential \\"Resource Centres\\", run by friends of the organisation, in Brazil and Germany.L'Abri Fellowship International web site.  Mode of operation  A L'Abri centre is not a retreat, a commune, or a seminary, although it incorporates elements of all of these. Visitors are referred to as students, and personal study remains central to L'Abri's work, but there are no fixed \\"classes\\" or courses. Rather students (who may spend any time from one day to a whole \\"term,\\" usually 2‚Äì3 months, at L'Abri) meet regularly with a member of staff to discuss the issues they wish to study, and are recommended resources from L'Abri's library of books and of recorded lectures and talks by L'Abri staff and others. A student's day is divided into \\"study time\\" and \\"work time.\\" During \\"work time,\\" a student will help with the necessary activities of the community ‚Äì cooking meals, cleaning, maintenance etc. This division is based on Schaeffer's constant emphasis that Christianity, and the work of L'Abri, were not only intellectual but had to incorporate all of life, and that a demonstration of \\"Christian Community\\" was as central to L'Abri's work as the intellectual demonstration that he believed could be made of the reasonableness and truthfulness of Christian belief. The importance of Schaeffer's belief in the relevance of Christianity to all of life can be seen in many aspects of L'Abri. Even so, some articles have suggested there is less of an emphasis on serving philosophical skeptics and more of an emphasis on serving disaffected evangelicals. In a recent article on the group, Molly Worthen suggests that students today come with very different questions, and that they tend to look at the politicized evangelical faith that Schaeffer helped create with suspicion.Worthen The L'Abri day revolves around communal meals, often used as an opportunity for formal open discussion, and students are encouraged to pursue interests in art, music and literature.Creegan, Nicola Hoggard, and Pohl, Christine D. (2005), Living on the Boundaries: Evangelical women, feminism, and the theological academy, InterVarsity Press, , p. 14. Apart from Francis and Edith Schaeffer and their children, several notable Evangelical authors have been influenced by working with L'Abri.Hankins, p. 63. Such former staff include Os Guinness,Marsh, Charles (2006), The Beloved Community: How Faith Shapes Social Justice from the Civil Rights Movement to Today, Basic Books, , p. 139. Hans Rookmaaker,Burson and Walls, p. 47. Greg Laughery,Smith, James K. A.

The L'Abri study center in Rochester, Minnesota also organizes bi-annual \\"L'Abri Conferences\\" in the USA and Canada at which L'Abri staff from across the world and other speakers supportive of the vision of L'Abri speak and lead seminars on a wide range of topics.L'Abri conference web site. In 2005, a conference was held in St. Louis, Missouri to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the organization, and over 1,000 attendees were present to hear speakers such as Os Guinness, Harold O. J. Brown, and Chuck Colson.Hankins, p. x. Thirty years ago Edith Schaeffer founded The Francis Schaeffer Foundation to receive her husband's papers and annotated books for scanning and subsequent study. This takes place under the direction of her son in law Udo Middelmann, who worked with Francis Schaeffer in L'Abri for seventeen years, where he was also Francis Schaeffer's associate pastor in Hu√©moz. He has written several books and there is a website with many lectures and information. Ideas, as Francis Schaeffer stated often, have consequences, which is why he asked people to not \\"start L'Abris\\", but rather take the ideas they had perhaps learned with him, and develop them in their own fields.

Very little is known about his biography: From 1637 he studied at Cracow University, then in 1643 he was a student of theology at the Sorbonne, Paris. He wrote a Polish ode on the occasion of the marriage of a certain Aleksander Przy≈Çƒôcki with Ewa Rupniowa, which was printed in 1641. Uzhevych is well known to East Slavic language historians as the author of the first grammar of the Ruthenian language. He wrote his name –Üœâ–∞–Ω–Ω—ä –£–∂–µ–≤–∏—á—ä –°–ª–æ–≤—è–Ω–∏–Ω—ä (Ioann Uzhevych Slovyanyn), Ioannes Usevicius Sclavonus, Ioannes Ugevicius Sclavonus, Jan U≈ºewic; in the student register of Cracow University he is written Ioannes Petri Uzewicz, but is today best known as: (Ivan Uzhevich), , (Ivan Uzhevich), (Ivan Uzhevych).  Life  Very little is known about his biography: From 1637 he studied at Cracow University, then in 1643 he was a student of theology at the Sorbonne, writing is indicated on the cover page.  The Grammatica sclavonica  Two manuscripts are known of Ivan Uzhevych‚Äôs Grammatica sclavonica, written in Latin: The Paris manuscript from 1643 and the Arras manuscript from 1645, called so because of the place it is kept now; no place of writing is indicated on the cover page. Both have been published in a scholarly edition in 1970. Uzhevych‚Äôs work, which seems to be influenced by the Polish grammar Polonicae grammatices institutio (1568) by Piotr Stoje≈Ñski (Petrus Statorius) and by Meletius Smotrytsky‚Äôs Church Slavonic grammar Gramatiki slavenskija pravilnoje syntagma (1619), is the only grammar known of the Ruthenian language of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the predecessor of modern Ukrainian and Belarusian, which the author calls lingua popularis, ‚Äúvulgar tongue‚Äù. It is the first grammar of an East Slavic language (and not of Church Slavonic, which Uzhevych calls lingua sacra, ‚Äúsacred tongue‚Äù). Both Belarusian and Ukrainian linguistics have been trying to show that Uzhevych's grammar belongs to the history of their respective language and not the other one. Thus, Ivan Bilodid (1972), Mykhaylo Zhovtobryukh (1976), and Vasyl Nimchuk (1985) have stressed Ukrainian features of his language, whereas Aleksandr Sobolevskiy (1906), Vatroslav Jagiƒá (1907), James Dingley (1972) and Yuriy Shevelov (1979) have pointed out its Belarusian aspects. Olexa Horbatsch (1967) assumes that Uzhevych came from the modern Ukrainian-Belarusian borderlands, which at that time, of course, were not a borderland at all. Uzhevych's grammar includes a lot of parallel forms that have later been incorporated into either the modern Belarusian or the modern Ukrainian language. For example, for ‚Äòwhat‚Äô both —â–æ (≈°ƒço), as in modern Ukrainian, and —à—Ç–æ (≈°to), as in modern Belarusian, appear. This shows that Uzhevych's intention was to describe not his own dialect but a common, partially standardized, Ruthenian language (cf. History of the East Slavic languages). Uzhevych's grammar exhibits a distinctly comparative approach. It is probably not a coincidence that its title is Grammatica sclavonica, not ruthenica. Much of what is written about Ruthenian seems to be meant for Church Slavonic, too, and where the two languages differ, Uzhevych often includes specific information on Church Slavonic. Apart from that, he comments on differences in Polish, Czech, Moravian, and Croatian, citing, for example, the Lord's Prayer in Church Slavonic, Ruthenian, and Croatian (in the Glagolitic alphabet). As usual at that time, the grammar shows the difficulties of superimposing the Latin grammatical system on a very different language. Thus, on the one hand there are long lists of constructed verb forms that are of no practical relevance for Ruthenian, e.g. the optative pluperfect –±–æ–¥–∞–π –±—ã–º—ä –±—ã–ª—ä –∫–æ–≤√°–ª—ä (bodaj bym‚Äù byl‚Äù koval‚Äù) ‚Äòoh would I have had cooked!‚Äô (Arras, 452), but on the other hand the locative case is not reflected, and Uzhevych tries to explain the respective endings, which sometimes resemble the dative, sometimes the instrumental (ablative) endings, as casus vagabundi, ‚Äúwandering cases‚Äù (Arras, 332-341).  Rozmova ¬∑ Besƒõda  As Helmut Keipert (2001) has shown, the anonymous and undated manuscript titled Rozmova and Besƒõda (which linguists so far wrongly attributed to the end of the 16th century) is also an autograph by Ivan Uzhevych. Just like the first of the manuscripts of Uzhevych's grammar, it is now kept in the French National Library at Paris. The manuscript is a parallel translation of the popular phrasebook by No√´l de Berlaimont into Ruthenian and Church Slavonic. The left, Ruthenian column of each page (the Rozmova part) is titled ‚ÄúPopularis‚Äù, and the right, Church Slavonic one (the Besƒõda part) ‚ÄúSacra‚Äù. Maybe the author wanted to demonstrate in practice the differences described in his grammar between the ‚Äúvulgar‚Äù and the ‚Äúsacred‚Äù tongue. Anyway, this phrasebook provides a lot of linguistic material to fill the gaps in the Grammatica sclavonica, which itself contains only little actual Ruthenian text, as it is written in Latin. Apart from that, the phrasebook consists of very straightforward, colloquial, every-day dialogues ‚Äî those that made Berlaimont's work the most popular phrasebook of all times. It was reprinted more than 150 times all over Europe between the beginning of the 16th and the end of the 19th century in versions with from two to eight language columns. The manuscript was published in a scholarly edition in 2005 together with the Latin original from 1613 and a translation of the same text into Polish from a print of 1646.

Career  = Early career = Completing his studies in Ch√¢teaulin, young Cosmao-Kerjulien joined the French Royal Navy in 1776, against his parents' will. He served in the Aigrette in the Caraibs. Back to Brest in 1778, he served on the Oiseau with Corentin de Leissegues. In September, after the beginning of the American Revolutionary War, he served on the Nymphe, taking part in two battles against English privateers, near Bordeaux and Belle-Isle. Between January 1779 and April 1781, he served in Guyana aboard the brig Hirondelle, fighting two more English privateers and capturing two East Indiamen. He was promoted to Lieutenant of an auxiliary frigate in September 1781. He served successively aboard the P√©gase (February 1782) and the Protecteur (March) before taking command of the Fluyt Fid√®le in Terre Neuve from May 1783 to April 1784. In January 1785 he served on the Lourde, on the Vigilante on October and the Dorade in April 1786. He was made a sub-lieutenant on a ship of the line in March 1786. In September 1787, he was given command of the brig Vaneau, and of the Boulonnaise for November 1787 to March 1790. From October 1790 to January 1791, he was first officer aboard the Pr√©cieuse. From February 1791, he served aboard the Orion of the squadron of Laurent Jean Fran√ßois Truguet in Toulon. He was made ship of the line full lieutenant in January 1792, and received command of the corvette Sinc√®re in April. He took part in the landing at Cagliari in January 1793. = Captain = In the context of the lack of qualified officers due to the Revolution, he was made Capitaine de Vaisseau in April 1793, serving aboard the , the Centaure and the Duguay-Trouin, under Rear-Admiral Trogoff de Kerlessy. His grave at St Martin cemetery, Brest In December 1794 he was transferred to the squadron commanded by Admiral Pierre Martin, where he commanded the 80-gun ship of the line . On 10 June 1795, he captured the English frigate Alceste, and took part in the Battle of Cape Noli in March 1795 (the French and the English both lost two ships of the line) and of Cape Frejus (17 French ships of the line against 23 English; the French lost the 74-gun Alcide). In June 1797, he was made chief of division, commanding the Jemmapes in the Mediterranean. From 1801 to 1803, he served under Dordelin in Saint-Domingue, commanding the , the Alliance and the . The French fleet under Captain Cosmao attacking Diamond Rock. Painting by Auguste Mayer. Back to France, he assumed command of the 74-gun 'Pluton' in the squadron of Admiral Villeneuve in Toulon. He accompanied the squadron to the Caraibs in its seizing of the English fortress of the Diamond Rock, away from Martinique. Back to Europe, he took part in the Battle of Cape Finisterre, on 22 July, saving one Spanish ship which had been cut off for a time by the British. = Battle of Trafalgar = At the Battle of Trafalgar, Pluton was part of the reconnaissance squadron created by Villeneuve and commanded by Spanish Admiral Gravina. She followed the in the line of battle, in the rear. When Admiral Collingwood attacked, Pluton opened fire on , then manoeuvered in order to block HMS Mars, damaged her with artillery fire and attempted to board and seize her. However, the arrival of in her stern forced her to turn. She engaged , already damaged by the fire of Fougueux; again another English ship, , forced her to disengage. She then helped the surrounded of Gravina, and succeeded in freeing her. However, at this point, the battle was already lost for the French. At sunset, five French ships (, , , and and six Spanish ships tried to return to C√°diz, under dying Admiral Gravina. On 23 October, Cosmao, as one of the most senior officers present, jointly took command of the squadron with Spanish Comodore Enrique MacDonell, and set back to sea with five ships: Pluton, H√©ros, Neptune, San Francisco de Asis, and Rayo. Cosmao later tried to claim sole credit for the sortie but this is not correct as both MacDonell and Cosmao both had Commodore pennants raised. He managed to retake Neptuno and Santa Ana, as well as to force the English to scuttle a number of their prizes. Neptuno and Rayo sank during the journey back and the Indomptable was wrecked with the loss of over a thousand men. = Late career = Cosmao-Kerjulien was made Rear Admiral on 29 May 1806. He took command of a division of the French Mediterranean Fleet, under Ganteaume from 1807. he took part in operations to resupply Corfu and to the landing in Sicily. His 4 ships, having sustained damage, retreated to Taranto. In late 1809, Ganteaume was organising reinforcements to Barcelona. Cosmao set his flag on and took command of a squadron comprising , , and , as well as the frigates and , and a dozen of transports. The fleet departed Toulon on 24 April 1809, and returned on 1 May without incident. Cosmao was made baron in 1810. In August 1811, he served under Admiral Missiessy in the Escaut Squadron, commanding a division, with his flag in the ship-of-the-line Tilsit. In 1813 he returned to the Mediterranean Fleet, where he commanded a 5-ship division, with his flag on the . At the Action of 5 November 1813, he saved the 74-gun and the frigates P√©n√©lope and Melpom√®ne which were under threat to be surrounded by superior English forces. Romulus In February 1814, he set sail with three ships from Toulon to Genoa, threatened by the Austrians, to bring back the Scorpion. He escaped the forces of Admiral Pellew and successfully returned to Toulon on the 10th with the Scorpion without losing a ship, though the , at the rear, did suffer some damage. During the First Restoration, in April 1814, Cosmao- Kerjulien received command of the Mediterranean Fleet, and was appointed a Knight of the Order of Saint Louis. In 1815, upon the Emperor's brief return to power, he rallied to Napoleon, who made him pr√©fet maritime of Brest in March, and a Peer of France in June, right before the Battle of Waterloo. Cosmao-Kerjulien was retired on 1 January 1816, and for one year he did not receive a pension.

He was an academician of the Academy of Sciences of the Ukrainian SSR (1951), Merited Science Specialist of Ukrainian SSR (1966), Merited Art Specialist of Georgian SSR (1964), People's Poet of Uzbek SSR. Career Bazhan was a People's Deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union for two of five convocations (1946-1962), and the Supreme Council of the Ukrainian SSR for six of nine convocations (1963-1980). He was a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and was elected to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Ukrainian SSR on several occasions at the party's congresses (17 of and 21 of 25). In 1943-49 Bazhan was a Deputy Chairman of the Council of Minister (Commissars) of the Ukrainian SSR. Biography Mykola Bazhan was born in city of Kamenyets, an administrative center of Podolia Governorate, yet his youth years he spent in Uman, Kiev Governorate. His father Platon Artemovych Bazhan, a native of Poltava region, was a military cartographer and a veteran of the Ukrainian People's Army. In 1923 Mykola Bazhan graduated from the Uman Cooperative College and moved to Kiev where he studied at a cooperative institute at first and later at an institute of foreign relations. He was active in the Futurist literary movement, and his first poem was published in Kiev in 1923 and his first book \\"Seventeenth Patrol\\" in Kharkiv in 1926. In 1926 he married a Ukrainian writer and native of Kiev Hayina Kovalenko. They divorced in 1938, and he remarried, to Nina Lauer, shortly thereafter.http://museumlit.org.ua/?page_id=894 During the 1930s Bazhan work was viewed as \\"anti-proletarian\\" and became a subject of a number official anti-nationalist campaigns. In 1937 he felt his arrest was imminent and he rarely slept at home. In 1939 Bazhan was awarded the Order of Lenin for his translation into Ukrainian of the epic poem \\"The Warrior in the Tiger's skin\\" by the medieval Georgian poet Shota Rustaveli. Bazhan found out about this, from a newspaper, while hiding from his imminent arrest in a city park in Kiev. He was eventually told by Nikita Khrushchev that his arrest had been ordered, but Stalin was fond of his Rustaveli translation, and changed his mind. In 1940 Mykola Bazhan was forced to join the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. During the Great Patriotic War Bazhan became a military reporter and the editor of the newspaper For the Soviet Ukraine. In 1943 he published a book, Stalingrad Notebook, for which in 1946 he received the Stalin Prize. In 1953-59 Bazhan headed the Writer's Union of Ukraine. During the \\"Khrushchev thaw\\", on July 2, 1956 he raised before the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine the issue of rehabilitation several repressed writers: Vasyl Bobynsky, Hryhorii Epik, Ivan Kulyk, Mykola Kulish, and many more. In 1970 Bazhan was nominated for a Nobel Prize in literature, but he was forced by Soviet authorities to write a letter refusing his candidature. From 1957 and until his death, Bazhan was the founding chief editor of the Main Edition of Ukrainian Soviet Encyclopedia publishing. The publishing was not completed in his lifetime; the first edition was, however, as the initial Ukrainian Soviet Encyclopedia in 17 volumes was released 1959-1965\\\\. A second (and final, as events would develop) 12-volume work was released 1977-1985\\\\. The enterprise was additionally responsible for a large number of other major Ukrainian reference works. Bazhan also was one of co-authors of the Anthem of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. He died in Kiev in 1983. Moisei Fishbein, a notable Ukrainian poet was Bazhan's literary secretary.

VACLs may be used in similar fashion to a SPAN port or network tap, as a way to replicate computer network data that is coming into and leaving from a computer or a network. This is useful if you want to monitor traffic. Often, this configuration is used to facilitate data loss prevention (DLP) or network-based Intrusion prevention systems. VACL or VACL Ports can be much more discriminating of the traffic they forward compared to a standard SPAN port.

It generally involves a material being trapped within an unreactive matrix. A host matrix is a continuous solid phase in which guest particles (atoms, molecules, ions, etc.) are embedded. The guest is said to be isolated within the host matrix. Initially the term matrix-isolation was used to describe the placing of a chemical species in any unreactive material, often polymers or resins, but more recently has referred specifically to gases in low-temperature solids. A typical matrix isolation experiment involves a guest sample being diluted in the gas phase with the host material, usually a noble gas or nitrogen. This mixture is then deposited on a window that is cooled to below the melting point of the host gas. The sample may then be studied using various spectroscopic procedures. Experimental setup Apparatus for transmission measurements The transparent window, on to which the sample is deposited, is usually cooled using a compressed helium or similar refrigerant. Experiments must be performed under a high vacuum to prevent contaminants from unwanted gases freezing to the cold window. Lower temperatures are preferred, due to the improved rigidity and \\"glassiness\\" of the matrix material. Noble gases such as argon are used not just because of their unreactivity but also because of their broad optical transparency in the solid state. Mono-atomic gases have relatively simple face-centered cubic (fcc) crystal structure, which can make interpretations of the site occupancy and crystal-field splitting of the guest easier. In some cases a reactive material, for example, methane, hydrogen or ammonia, may be used as the host material so that the reaction of the host with the guest species may be studied. Using the matrix isolation technique, short-lived, highly-reactive species such as radical ions and reaction intermediates may be observed and identified by spectroscopic means. For example, the solid noble gas krypton can be used to form an inert matrix within which a reactive F3‚àí ion can sit in chemical isolation. The reactive species can either be generated outside (before deposition) the apparatus and then be condensed, inside the matrix (after deposition) by irradiating or heating a precursor, or by bringing together two reactants on the growing matrix surface. For the deposition of two species it can be crucial to control the contact time and temperature. In Twin Jet deposition the two species have a much shorter contact time (and lower temperature) than in Merged Jet. With Concentric Jet the contact time is adjustable. Different deposition techniques Spectroscopy Within the host matrix, the rotation and translation of the guest particle is usually inhibited. Therefore, the matrix isolation technique may be used to simulate a spectrum of a species in the gas phase without rotational and translational interference. The low temperatures also help to produce simpler spectra, since only the lower electronic and vibrational quantum states are populated. Especially infrared spectroscopy, which is used to investigate molecular vibration, benefits from the matrix isolation technique. For example, in the gas-phase IR spectrum of fluoroethane some spectral regions are very difficult to interpret, as vibrational quantum states heavily overlap with multiple rotational-vibrational quantum states. When fluoroethane is isolated in argon or neon matrices at low temperatures, the rotation of the fluoroethane molecule is inhibited. Because rotational-vibrational quantum states are quenched in the matrix isolation IR spectrum of fluoroethane, all vibrational quantum states can be identified. This is especially useful for the validation of simulated infrared spectra that can be obtained from computational chemistry. History Matrix isolation has its origins in the first half of the 20th century with the experiments by photo-chemists and physicists freezing samples in liquefied gases. The earliest isolation experiments involved the freezing of species in transparent, low temperature organic glasses, such as EPA (ether/isopentane/ethanol 5:5:2). The modern matrix isolation technique was developed extensively during the 1950s, in particular by George C. Pimentel. He initially used higher-boiling inert gases like xenon and nitrogen as the host material, and is often said to be the \\"father of matrix isolation\\". Laser vaporization in matrix isolation spectroscopy was first brought about in 1969 by Schaeffer and Pearson using a YAG laser to vaporize carbon which reacted with hydrogen to produce acetylene. They also showed that laser-vaporized boron would react with HCl to create BCl. In the 1970s, Koerner von Gustorf's lab used the technique to produce free metal atoms which were then deposited with organic substrates for use in organometallic chemistry. Spectroscopic studies were done on reactive intermediates in around the early 1980s by Bell Labs. They used laser-induced fluorescence to characterize multiple molecules like SnBi and SiC. Smalley's group employed the use of this method with time-of-flight mass spectrometry by analyzing Al clusters. With the work of chemists like these, laser- vaporization in matrix isolation spectroscopy rose in popularity due to its ability to generate transients involving metals, alloys and semi-conductor molecules and clusters.

It was developed by Ganbarion and published by Nintendo. The game was released on August 8, 2005, in Japan and accompanied the release of a red Nintendo DS. A sequel, Jump Ultimate Stars, was released in Japan on November 23, 2006. Gameplay Jump Super Stars features characters from the Japanese manga magazine Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump. The game supports 2-4 players in multiplayer and features over 75 missions. Koma (panel) is the term for the characters that the player can use in the game. Each koma uses from 1 to 7 squares of the koma deck at the bottom screen of the Nintendo DS. The deck has 20 squares (4 x 5) for the player to place their koma. There are three types of koma: help koma, support koma and battle koma. * Help koma are only one square large. They'll boost up or help players in the game, but they will not appear on Battle Screen. * Support koma are two to three squares large. These koma will show up briefly on the battle screen to help the player, generally by attacking, blocking, restoring health, or some other move. * Battle koma are four to seven squares large, and these koma fight throughout each round. These koma represents the characters that the player controls in the battle screen, and the player can switch between characters by tapping their koma in the koma deck like a tag battle. The player can build and store up to ten koma decks, and each deck must have at least one help koma, one support koma and one battle koma to be valid for use in battle. There are also a set of predefined decks that the player can use, but the player cannot change or delete those. It is also possible to exchange decks between friends, but they won't be able to edit the decks. Ally boosting is done by placing koma next to each other in the deck maker. If the koma placed next to each other are \\"compatible\\", their attributes will go up. Battle characters can get a longer health bar, or increase the maximum number of special attack gauges.

He is the founder of the concept of historical continuity of Greece from antiquity to the present, establishing the tripartite division of Greek history in ancient, medieval and modern, and sought to set aside the prevailing views at the time that the Byzantine Empire was a period of decadence and degeneration. Paparrigopoulos introduced this division in his teaching at the University of Athens. His main work is the multi-volume History of the Greek Nation (ŒôœÉœÑŒøœÅŒØŒ± œÑŒøœÖ ŒïŒªŒªŒ∑ŒΩŒπŒ∫Œøœç ŒàŒ∏ŒΩŒøœÖœÇ), covering the history of the Greeks from ancient to modern times, including the rediscovery of the Greek Middle Ages and their integration as part of the national history of Greece. He is also known for contradicting with robust arguments the controversial theories of Jakob Philipp Fallmerayer regarding the racial origins of the Greeks. Life The signature of Constantine Paparrigopoulos Paparrigopoulos was born in Constantinople in 1815. His father, a native of Vytina, was killed by the rabble of Constantinople when the Greek War of Independence erupted in 1821. Paparrigopoulos not only saw this grisly spectacle, but he also attended the execution of his brother, Michael, and of his two uncles. His mother who survived the slaughters fled to Odessa, where Paparrigopoulos accomplished his studies at the Richelieu Lyceum as a bursar of the Tsar Alexander I. In 1830 Paparrigopoulos travelled to Greece to study in the \\"Central School\\" (ŒöŒµŒΩœÑœÅŒπŒ∫œå Œ£œáŒøŒªŒµŒØŒø) of Aegina, founded by the Greek leader Ioannis Kapodistrias. He continued his studies in the universities of France and Germany. Returning to Greece Paparrigopoulos was appointed in the ministry of Justice, but in 1845 he withdrew because he did not yet possess a Greek nationality. He was reappointed as a teacher when he obtained the Greek nationality (as a \\"Gortynian\\"). In 1851 he became a professor of history of the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens. In 1873 Paparrigopoulos lost his beloved son and famous poet, Dimitrios Paparrigopoulos. In 1876 and 1884 the Greek state utilised him for national purposes, appointing him as president of the \\"National Defence\\" and as president of the \\"Exhibition of the relics of the War of Independence\\". Work In 1843, while working in the Ministry of Justice, Paparrigopoulos published his first survey, About the emigration of Slav tribes in Peloponnese, contradicting with robust argumentsŒ†ŒµœÅŒØ œÑŒ∑œÇ ŒµœÄŒøŒπŒ∫ŒÆœÉŒµœâœÇ Œ£ŒªŒ±Œ≤ŒπŒ∫œéŒΩ œÑŒπŒΩœéŒΩ œÜœÖŒªœéŒΩ ŒµŒπœÇ œÑŒ∑ŒΩ Œ†ŒµŒªŒøœÄœåŒΩŒΩŒ∑œÉŒøŒΩ (in greek) Fallmerayer's opinion that modern Greeks are of Slav descent, having no racial relation with the ancient Greeks. In 1844, he published his second survey, The last year of the Greek independence, treating the fall of Corinth. In 1855 he gave his inaugural lecture as professor of the university, contradicting a theory that did not recognise the importance of the Dorian influence on the civilization of ancient Greece. Nonetheless, his monumental writing is the History of the Greek nation, comprising 6 volumes, which were later complemented by Pavlos Karolidis. Paparrigopoulos published the first volume in 1860 and completed his work in 1877 with the last volume, which constituted a synopsis of the Greek War of Independence. The best edition of the History of the Greek nation is the edition of Eleftheroudakis in 1925 with the application of Karolidis. In this work he adopted the tripartite examination of periods already introduced by Spyros Zampelios (ancient Hellenism, medieval Hellenism, modern Hellenism) and used it as a tool for the narration of the course of the Greek nation throughout the centuries. Assessments Paparrigopoulos is considered the \\"national\\" historian of modern Greece. In his History of the Greek Nation, he regarded the history of Greece from the ancient years till nowadays as a unity, insisting on the continuity of the Greek nation. At the same time he promoted the importance of the Byzantine Empire and of the Byzantine history in general. Because of his profound surveys, the disdain towards the Byzantine history was limited. The interpretation of Byzantium's Greek character in the work of Sp. Zampelios was the first step in the effort to refute Fallmerayer's theory. It was supported that the ancient Greek civilization had not faded away, but had been creatively reshaped as it met Christianity, which took place during the Byzantine Empire. With Zampelios then, the foundations were prepared in order for a total national history to be written, in order for the past, the continuous course of the Greek nation from antiquity till the 19th century, to be narrated. This ambitious project was undertaken and completed by Constantine Paparrigopoulos, who is considered for this reason the founder of Greek national historiography, also known as Greek historism. Paparrigopoulos, as well as Sp. Zampelios, set the basis of the modern Greek historiography and influenced the modern Greek society. Since, their work did not concern only a closed and restricted circle of specialists and academics. It was addressed to the society of their times, in order to strengthen their national self-knowledge. Paparrigopoulos' classes at the University, which constituted the raw material for the writing of his memorable History, were frequently published in Pandora magazine, of which he was the co-publisher, as well as in the Athenian Press. The term Greek-Christian which was devised for scientific purposes, functioned towards the same direction but did not remain a simple instrument of analysis in the hands of specialists. As this term appeared in early ninth century, it became a canvass on which the ideology of the Greek state was developed and shaped. The content of education, the orientation of historical studies and the study of tradition (folklore) were organized on this basis. In addition, the Megali Idea (Greek Great Idea) which was nebulous until that time, acquired flesh and bones. The Byzantine Empire, which had now been acclaimed a cultural mold of the Greek state which was still small, became the model for its territorial expansion. Another great virtue of Paparrigopoulos is the elegance of his style and his literary charisma, which makes his texts readable and his narrations particularly vivid. His elegance is the main merit that places him higher than the other great modern Greek historian, Pavlos Karolidis. Paparrigopoulos not only offered a united image of the history (ancient-medieval-modern) of the Greek nation, but, at the same time, he articulated in the most stirring way the pains and the dramas of the modern Hellenism.

From 1910 to 1912 Caulfield served as Judge of the Missouri Court of Appeals for the Eastern District, based in St. Louis. In 1914 Caulfield served as Counsel for the St. Louis City and County Board of Freeholders. In 1921 and 1922 Caulfield was St. Louis City Counselor. In 1925 and 1926 he was chairman of the Board of Freeholders. In 1928 Caulfield ran successfully for Governor of Missouri, and he served from January 14, 1929 to January 9, 1933. During his term Caulfield founded the Missouri State Highway Patrol, and worked to cope with strains on the state budget caused by the Great Depression. Near the end of his term in 1933 state legislature, which was controlled by Republicans, attempted to gerrymander Congressional districts in order elect more Republicans. Caulfield vetoed the bill, which forced Missouri's U.S. House members to run at-large, resulting in Democratic candidates winning every seat. Caulfield was the keynote speaker at the 1932 Republican National Convention. In 1937 and 1938 he served on the St. Louis Board of Election Commissioners. He was the unsuccessful Republican nominee for United States Senator in 1938, losing to incumbent Democrat Bennett Champ Clark. From 1941 to 1949 he served as director of public welfare in St. Louis. He then resumed the practice of law, and in 1953 served as a member of the State Reorganization Commission, which proposed reforms to state government. Death and burial Caulfield died in St. Louis on May 11, 1966. He was interred at Oak Grove Cemetery in St. Louis. Family His brother William E. Caulfield (1871-1946) was also involved in politics, and served on the St. Louis City Council, in the Missouri House of Representatives, and in the Missouri State Senate. Caulfield was married twice. In 1897 he married Adele Lopez, who died in 1898. In 1902 he married Fannie Alice Delano, and they were the parents of four children.  External links  * *Henry S.

He was the youngest of the \\"Illustrious Generation\\" of 15th-century Portuguese princes of the House of Aviz and lay administrator of the Knightly Order of Aviz. In 1437, Ferdinand participated in the disastrous Siege of Tangier led by his older brother Henry the Navigator. In the aftermath, Ferdinand was handed over to the Marinid rulers of Morocco as a hostage for the surrender of Ceuta in accordance with the terms of a treaty negotiated between the rulers of Portugal and Morocco by Henry. At first, Ferdinand was held in relative comfort as a noble hostage in Asilah, but when it became apparent that the Portuguese authorities had no intention of giving up Ceuta, Ferdinand's status was downgraded, and he was transferred to a prison in Fez, where he was subjected to much harsher incarceration conditions by his jailers. Negotiations for his release continued intermittently for years, but they came to naught, and Ferdinand eventually died in captivity in Fez on 5 June 1443. A popular cult quickly developed in Portugal around the figure of \\"the Holy Prince\\" (O Infante Santo), strongly encouraged by the House of Aviz. Ferdinand remains a \\"popular saint\\" by Portuguese tradition, neither beatified nor canonized by the Catholic Church.  Early life  Ferdinand was the sixth and youngest son of King John I of Portugal and his wife Philippa of Lancaster. Ferdinand and his brothers Edward of Portugal, Peter of Coimbra, Henry the Navigator and John of Reguengos, plus sister Isabella of Burgundy and half-brother Afonso of Barcelos, constitute what Portuguese historians have traditionally labelled the 'illustrious generation' (√çnclita Gera√ß√£o). Ferdinand was born in Santar√©m on 29 September 1402, the feast day of St. Michael, a saint to whom he would remain affectionately attached.√Ålvares (pp. 5‚Äì6) He had a complicated birth and would remain a sickly child throughout much of his youth.√Ålvares (p. 7); Cacegas and Sousa (p. 312) Relatively sheltered because of his illnesses, Ferdinand had a quiet and very pious upbringing, a favorite of his English mother, from whom he acquired a preference for the Sarum Rite of Salisbury in the religious liturgy of masses he attended.Alvares (p. 8)  Master of Aviz  Coat of arms of Ferdinand the Holy Prince. His knightly motto was le bien me plait. Ferdinand was too young to participate in the 1415 Battle of Ceuta led by his father, John I, in which his older brothers distinguished themselves and were knighted.√Ålvares (pp. 95‚Äì96) As the youngest of many sons, Ferdinand did not obtain a substantial endowment from his father, only the Lordship of Salvaterra de Magos and a lifetime grant of Atouguia in 1429.Pina, Chronica de D. Duarte (p. 52); Cacegas and Sousa (1866: p. 312) In 1434, after the death of his father John I and the administrator Jo√£o Rodrigues de Sequeira, Ferdinand was appointed lay administrator of the Knightly Order of Aviz by his brother King Edward of Portugal.Pina (p. 40); Pope Eugenius IV's bull Sincere Deuotionis appointing Ferdinand to head the Order of Avis in September 1434 can be found in Monumenta Henricina, vol. V (p. 69) Ferdinand was also offered the titular office of cardinal by Pope Eugene IV, but turned it down.√Ålvares (pp. 43‚Äì44), Cacegas and Sousa (p. 314). Also Despite his piety, Ferdinand had no intention of pursuing a clerical career.  Siege of Tangier  In 1436, dissatisfied with his meager domains, Ferdinand asked his brother King Edward for permission to go abroad to seek his fortune in the service of a foreign king (reportedly, Henry VI of England).Ruy de Pina, Chronica d'El Rey D. Duarte, Ch. 10; Russell, 2000: p. 151; Frei Jo√£o √Ålvares (p. 42) suggests the prince's destination was England. Ferdinand's request prompted the reluctant Edward to endorse a plan, long promoted by his brother Henry the Navigator, to launch a new Portuguese campaign of conquest against Marinid Morocco.Russell (2000: p. 151) As a bachelor, Ferdinand made out a will naming Edward's second son, the Infante Ferdinand (future Duke of Viseu) as his heir before departing.Alvares (p. 50) In August 1437, the Portuguese expeditionary force, under the leadership of Henry the Navigator, set out to seize Tangier. Ferdinand brought his household and Aviz knights with him, choosing as his personal banner an emblazoned image of the Archangel St. Michael.√Ålvares (p. 54) The Tangier campaign proved to be a disastrous fiasco. Henry impetuously launched a series of assaults on the walls of Tangier with no success, while allowing his siege camp to be encircled by a Moroccan army rushed north by the Wattasid strongman Abu Zakariya Yahya al-Wattasi, governor of the Marinid palace of Fez (called Lazeraque by the Portuguese chroniclers). The Portuguese besiegers, now besieged and unable to break out, were starved into submission. To preserve his army from destruction, Henry the Navigator signed a treaty in October 1437 with the Moroccan commanders. It called for the restoration of Ceuta (which had been captured by the Portuguese back in 1415) in return for allowing to his army to withdraw intact (albeit with their weapons left behind). By the terms of the treaty, Henry handed his younger brother Ferdinand over to the Moroccans as a hostage for the delivery of Ceuta.Ruy de Pina, Cronica de D. Duarte, (p. 125). Russell (2000: pp. 182‚Äì84). A copy of the treaty of October 17, 1437 is preserved and found in Monumenta Henricina, Vol. VI, p. 211 It was later reported that Henry personally volunteered to go as hostage instead of Ferdinand, but that his war council forbade it.Henry's offer is reported in Ruy de Pina Chr. D. Duarte (c. 1510: p. 125). However, Russell (2000, pp. 183‚Äì84) doubts its veracity.  Hostage in Asilah  1621 portrait of Ferdinand the Holy Prince in armor (from Antonio Vasconcellos's Anacephalaeoses). Ferdinand was formally a hostage of Salah ibn Salah (called √áallaben√ßalla in the Portuguese chronicles), the Marinid governor of Tangier and Asilah (and lord claimant of Ceuta). Ferdinand was allowed to bring along a private entourage of eleven household servants into captivity with him. This included his secretary (and future chronicler) Frei Jo√£o √Ålvares; his household governor Rodrigo Esteves; his wardrobe keeper Fern√£o Gil; his confessor, Frei Gil Mendes; his physician mestre Martinho (son of the late chronicler Fern√£o Lopes); his chaplain Pero Vasques; his head cook Jo√£o Vasques; his chamberlain Jo√£o Rodrigues (described as a colla√ßo, meaning a foster-brother or close confidante of Ferdinand); his quartermaster (aposentador) Jo√£o Louren√ßo; his hearth-keeper Jo√£o de Luna; and his pantry keeper (homen de reposta) Crist√≥v√£o de Luvi√ßa Alem√£o.√Ålvares (p. 66) lists the first eight; the other three names are given later ( pp. 110‚Äì11). See also Calado (1964: p. 24); Russell (2000 :p. 184) √Ålvares was entrusted with Ferdinand's money purse, estimated to be carrying some 6,000 reals for expenses.Calado (1964: p. 25) They were joined by an additional set of four Portuguese noble hostages identified as Pedro de Ata√≠de, Jo√£o Gomes de Avelar, Aires da Cunha and Gomes da Cunha/Silva. The first three were knights of Ferdinand's household, the last a knight of Aviz.Ruy de Pina Chr. D. Duarte (p. 125) calls the last one \\"Gomes da Cunha\\", whereas √Ålvares (p. 66) calls him \\"Gomes da Silva\\". The Castelo de Noudar, held by Gomes da Cunha, was a commenda of the Order of Aviz. (Caetano de Sousa, Historia Genealogica da Casa Real Portugueza 1739, p. 265) These four were not part of Ferdinand's entourage, but part of a separate temporary hostage swap to ensure the smooth embarkation of the defeated Portuguese troops back to their ships, for which Salah ibn Salah gave his own eldest son as hostage to the Portuguese in return. These were meant to be released once the troops were boarded, whereas Ferdinand and his entourage were only to be released upon the evacuation and handover of Ceuta. Ferdinand, his entourage and the four knights were handed over to Salah ibn Salah on the evening of 16 October 1437 by the Portuguese negotiator Rui Gomes da Silva (alcaide of Campo Maior), who then received the son of Salah ibn Salah in return. The hostages stayed in a tower inside Tangiers while the troops evacuated the beach. But the embarcation did not go smoothly. Discipline broke down and a skirmish broke out on the beach, apparently provoked when some of the Portuguese soldiers were caught smuggling forbidden items.Russell (2000: pp. 184‚Äì85) After the troops were all embarked (19 or 21 October 19), Henry the Navigator refused to release his own temporary hostage, the eldest son of Salah ibn Salah, cut the moorings and sailed off. As a result, the four noble hostages were now stranded in Moroccan captivity. Hearing of the beach skirmish and receiving no communication from Henry, Ferdinand was beside himself in tears, fearing that his brother had been among those killed. Ibn Salah sent a few men to investigate the bodies to assure him that Henry was not among them,√Ålvares ( pp. 71‚Äì72); Rusell (2000: p. 189) and when that was insufficient to comfort the prince, Ibn Salah even sent a messenger to Ceuta to try get written assurance from Henry himself.√Ålvares (p. 77) Ferdinand, the entourage and the four knights left Tangier on 22 October and made their way under Moroccan guard to Asilah (Arzila), thirty miles down the coast from Tangier.Calado (1964: p. 26) The Portuguese hostages were jeered by Moroccan crowds as they made their way. Upon arrival, Ferdinand and his entourage were kept in relatively comfortable quarters in Asilah, as would befit a royal hostage. He was allowed to write and receive correspondence from Portugal, interact with the local Christian community and had dealings with local Genoese merchants.Russell (2000: p.1 84) The entourage was also allowed to celebrate Christian mass daily.√Ålvares (p. 132) Fellow-prisoner Frei Jo√£o √Ålvares reports Ferdinand expected that the treaty would be promptly fulfilled ‚Äì that Ceuta would be evacuated and handed over and that they would soon be released.√Ålvares (pp. 89‚Äì90) Salah ibn Salah also expected to hear of the evacuation of Ceuta in a matter of days. Back in Portugal, the news of the defeat at Tangier and the subsequent treaty were received with shock. John of Reguengos immediately set sail for Asilah, hoping to negotiate Ferdinand's release in return for Salah ibn Salah's son (still being held hostage by Henry),√Ålvares (p. 81) but to no avail. The question of what to do divided Ferdinand's older brothers. Ceuta was highly symbolic ‚Äì the brothers had been made knights there when their father conquered the city back in 1415. Peter of Coimbra, who had been adamantly opposed to the whole Tangier expedition to begin with, urged their eldest brother, King Edward of Portugal, to fulfill the treaty immediately, order the evacuation of Ceuta and secure Ferdinand's release.Russell (2000: p. 188) But Edward was caught in indecision. Henry the Navigator, who stayed in Ceuta, depressed and incommunicado after the defeat in Tangier, eventually dispatched letters to Edward counseling against ratifying the treaty he had himself negotiated and suggesting other ways of getting Ferdinand released without surrendering Ceuta.Russell (2000: pp. 186‚Äì87) But Ferdinand himself wrote letters to Edward and Henry from Asilah noting that the Marinids were not likely to release him for anything less than Ceuta, urging them to fulfill the treaty and wondering what the delay was.√Ålvares (pp. 89‚Äì90); Russell (2000: p. 187) In January 1438, still undecided, Edward of Portugal convened the Portuguese Cortes in Leiria for consultation.Pina Chr. Duarte (Ch. 39), Russell (2000: pp. 187‚Äì8). An alternative record of the proceedings of the Cortes are set down in an informal letter dated 25 February 1438 to Diogo Gomes in Florence, reproduced in Monumenta Henricina, Vol. VI, p. 223 Ferdinand's letters were read before the Cortes, wherein Ferdinand expressed his desire to be released, and noted that Ceuta did not serve Portugal any strategic purpose and should be abandoned regardless.Pina Cronica de D. Duarte (p. 139) Contrary to later legend, it is clear from these letters that Ferdinand did not seek out a martyr's fate, that he wanted Ceuta to be handed over to the Marinids according to the terms of the treaty and that he wanted to be released swiftly.Russell (2000, p. 187) At the Cortes, urged by Peter and John, the burghers and clergy voted largely for the swap, but the nobles, rallied by Ferdinand of Arraiolos, argued strongly against it, with the result that the Cortes were dissolved without a decision being made.Pina Chr. Duarte (pp. 140‚Äì41); Russell (2000: p. 188‚Äì89) The decision to keep Ceuta was only made in June 1438, after a conference in Portel between Edward and Henry the Navigator.Russell (2000: p. 189) Henry once again urged a repudiation of the treaty and proposed alternative schemes to secure Ferdinand's release, e.g., ransoming him for money, persuading Castile and Aragon to join in a mass release of Muslim prisoners in exchange, raising a new army and invading Morocco all over again, etc.Russell (2000: pp. 189‚Äì90) After repeated entreaties from Ferdinand, Henry finally dispatched a message to his imprisoned brother giving his reasons for not fulfilling the treaty: firstly, that Henry had not had the royal authority to make such a treaty to begin with, and secondly, because of the beach skirmish at Tangier, Henry considered the treaty had already been violated and thus he was under no legal obligation to honor it.√Ålvares ( pp. 91‚Äì94)  Prisoner in Fez  Ferdinand the Holy Prince, from the 1450s triptych in Henry the Navigator's chapel at Batalha Monastery The Marinid authorities in Morocco were surprised and angered by the Portuguese repudiation of the treaty. Rumors of a plot to land a Portuguese amphibian force to break Ferdinand out of Asilah (a coastal city) prompted a decision to move him inland.√Ålvares (Ch. 17). On 25 May 1438, Abu Zakariya Yahya al-Wattasi, the powerful vizier of the Marinid palace in Fez, took charge of the hostages from Salah ibn Salah and ordered Ferdinand and his entourage transferred from his comfortable quarters in Asilah to a prison in Fez.√Ålvares( ch. 18), Russell (2000, p. 190). Of the original entourage, two did not make the transfer to Fez. Frei Fern√£o Gil, the confessor, had died in the winter of 1437‚Äì38, whereas Rodrigo Esteves, the head of household, fell ill, and Ibn Salah gave him permission to return to Portugal. In the case of Esteves, his son Pedro Rodrigues arrived from Portugal to stand hostage in his father's place.√Ålvares (p. 86). Pedro Rodrigues and the four knightly hostages remained in Asilah, while the others went on to Fez.√Ålvares (p. 111); Calado (1964: p. 28) Upon arrival in Fez in late May 1438, Ferdinand's entourage was placed in a prison where they met two Portuguese prisoners previously incarcerated: Diogo Delgado and √Ålvaro Eanes of Alverca.√Ålvares (pp. 120‚Äì21) Master Joseph, a Jewish surgeon and emissary of Salah ibn Salah who had accompanied the transfer from Asilah, was sent back by Abu Zakariya with instructions to inform Lisbon of the new circumstances. The entourage (plus the two prior prisoners) were sealed in the prison while awaiting the response. Conditions in Fez were considerably worse than at Asilah. Nonetheless, the two Portuguese prisoners taught the new arrivals how to get better food smuggled in from the city markets and put them in contact with a Majorcan merchant in Fez willing to supply the prince on credit.√Ålvares (p. 124); Amaral (2009: p. 22) On 11 October 1438, with no satisfactory reply received from Lisbon, Ferdinand's status was downgraded from treaty hostage to common prisoner.√Ålvares (ch.31) Moroccan guards searched through the cells and confiscated much of their remaining money, contact with the outside was cut off and the Majorcan merchant was flogged for his troubles. The twelve men were shoved into a smaller dungeon built to hold eight, given prison clothing and set on a strict diet of bread and water.√Ålvares (pp. 145‚Äì6) It was at this point that Ferdinand and his entourage were first put in leg irons.√Ålvares (p. 134) Fellow-prisoner √Ålvares reports that although the jailers occasionally threatened beatings and whippings, they never physically harmed Ferdinand or his companions, as they feared that any injury done to their prisoners would diminish their ransom value.√Ålvares (p. 175, p. 214) Nonetheless, they forced Ferdinand to undertake manual labor that was humiliating and unbefitting a noble prince, e.g. hoeing the palace gardens and cleaning the horse stables.√Ålvares (p. 137) Even so, √Ålvares reports that Ferdinand was determined to partake in the same fate as his companions, and when they were assigned to the harder prison jobs that Ferdinand had been spared, Ferdinand volunteered to go and labor alongside them (although this was soon forbidden him).√Ålvares (pp. 140‚Äì42) King Edward of Portugal died in August 1438 (of pestilence, said his doctors; of heartbreak over the hapless fate of Ferdinand, said popular lore).Russell (2000: p. 191) Shortly before his death, Edward changed his mind about the abandonment of Ceuta and dispatched an emissary, Fern√£o de Silva, to inform the Moroccans that the Portuguese would be fulfilling the treaty after all, and to make preparations for the Ferdinand's release.√Ålvares (pp. 149‚Äì50) But the death of Edward left Silva stranded in Asilah without credentials. Having come so close to being freed, the news (which arrived in Fez in November 1438) came as a double blow to Ferdinand, who promptly fell into despair.√Ålvares (p. 150) Nonetheless, Abu Zakariya ordered the leg irons taken off in the expectation that a deal might yet be struck with the new regime in Lisbon.√Ålvares (p. 159) The new state of affairs took some time to sort out ‚Äì Edward's death provoked an internal conflict in Portugal over the regency for his young son, the new king Afonso V of Portugal.Moreno (1973: ch.1) At length, the upper hand was gained by Edward's brother, Peter of Coimbra, who finally became regent of Portugal in early 1439. In May 1439, Ibn Salah and Abu Zakariya finally received a missive from the new regency council that they intended to fulfill the terms of the treaty concerning Ceuta.√Ålvares (pp. 159‚Äì60) But matters took another strange turn when Salah ibn Salah and Abu Zakariya bickered for control of the prisoner. In October 1439, a Jewish emissary from Ibn Salah (probably Master Joseph again) arrived in Fez intending to take Ferdinand and his entourage back to Asilah, but Abu Zakariya sent him away, saying he intended to continue holding on to the prisoner in Fez until the Portuguese sent someone with higher credentials who was empowered to undertake the surrender of Ceuta.√Ålvares (pp. 160‚Äì61) As soon as the emissary left, Ferdinand and his entourage were clapped back in leg irons, stripped of nearly all clothes and kept permanently locked up in their dungeon, day and night.√Ålvares (pp. 161‚Äì62) These new harsh measure were possibly precautionary rather than punitive to prevent any attempt by Ibn Salah's agents from trying to abscond with the valuable prisoner. In December, the prisoners (Ferdinand and his chaplain, Pero Vasques, excepted) were taken out of their permanent confinement to undertake hard road repair work in Fez.√Ålvares (p. 162) Scenes from Ferdinand's captivity and death in Fez (from the Bollandist's Acta Sanctorum, 1695). The only known depiction of Ferdinand with a saint's halo. When the road work was finished in February 1440, the companions were assigned to new work in the palace gardens and carpentry and masonry shops. However, things had taken another twist in the interim; Salah ibn Salah had died over the winter of 1439‚Äì40. As his eldest son was still in Portuguese captivity, the government of Asilah-Tangier (and notional control of Ferdinand) was passed to his brother Abu Bakr (known in the chronicles as Muley Bubuquer).√Ålvares (Ch. 25); Ruy de Pina, Chronica de D. Afonso V p. 109 √Ålvares reports that Abu Zakariya tried to lay claim on Ibn Salah's lands, provoking a quarrel with Abu Bakr. In turn, Abu Bakr conspired with a certain \\"Faquy Amar\\", who as tutor to a Marinid prince had access to the palace of Fez, to break Ferdinand out of prison.√Ålvares (p. 174) But Abu Zakariya got wind of the plot, and Faquy Amar fled the city. Things got more confusing when Gon√ßalo de Sintra, an agent of Henry the Navigator, arrived in Sal√© and told the Marinid authorities there that the Portuguese intended only to provide cash, not Ceuta, for Ferdinand. This caused the Marinids to accuse the Portuguese of double-dealing and reneging on their earlier offer.√Ålvares (p. 180) A letter finally arrived from the dowager-queen Eleanor, but it only pertained to some minor matter relating to the transfer of some lands back in Portugal and made no mention of the Ceuta swap.√Ålvares (p. 182) Each of these incidents infuriated the Marinids, who felt the Portuguese were being false and toying with them, and their anger fell harshly on Ferdinand, who was threatened and subjected to tighter conditions of confinement. Even the sympathy of the Marinid sultan Abd al-Haqq II and his wives ‚Äì who had previously mitigated Abu Zakariya's harshness, and gently treated the prince, occasionally inviting him to eat with them in the palace gardens ‚Äì was now alienated.√Ålvares (pp. 147; 183) Despite the undermining missteps of his relatives, the regent Peter of Coimbra was determined to undertake the swap, and he dispatched two emissaries, Martim Tavora and Gomes Eanes, to Asilah to negotiate the logistics. As a preliminary, Abu Bakr demanded that the governor of Ceuta, Fernando de Noronha, be relieved from office ‚Äì his reputation was such that the Moroccans believed Noronha would contrive to prevent the swap.Pina, Chr. Afonso V (v.1, p. 109) Peter had little trouble agreeing to it ‚Äì the Noronha family, closely allied with the Braganzas, were among Peter's keenest political enemies; indeed, Noronha's brothers had led the conspiracy of nobles which tried to deprive Peter of the regency back in 1438.Moreno (1973: p. 9) In early April 1440, Peter of Coimbra dispatched Fernando de Castro, a notable diplomat, to take over the government of Ceuta from Noronha and undertake the evacuation of the Portuguese garrison.Chroniclers Ruy de Pina (Chr. D. Afonso V, v.1, p. 111) and Frei Jo√£o √Ålvares (p. 184) date the expedition in late March or early April 1441. But, reviewing other evidence, the 1965 editors of the Monumenta Henricina, Vol 6, p. 176n suggest the expedition was more likely a year earlier, in April 1440. This is agreed by Moreno (1973: p. 18). The operation began inauspiciously. Castro's flotilla set out from Lisbon in a celebratory mood; the ambitious Fernando de Castro openly fantasized that, upon release, the Infante Ferdinand might be persuaded to marry his own daughter on the spot, and he prepared a rich and well-stocked expedition, packing the ships with banquet finery, an entourage of notables, and a bodyguard of some 1200 troops. But on the outward journey, around Cape Saint Vincent, the Portuguese flotilla was ambushed by Genoese pirates. The lead ship was boarded and Fernando de Castro killed. The pirates scampered away before the other ships could rescue him. Suspicions have been raised (but no proof) that Fernando de Noronha may have had a hand in directing the pirates against Castro in an effort to sabotage the mission. Ceuta was something of a corsair's nest, Portuguese governors routinely allowed foreign pirates to operate out of it in return for kickbacks and a share of the spoils, so it is almost inconceivable that Genoese pirates would dare attack Castro's fleet without Noronha's knowledge and consent. With the ambassador dead, the fleet put in at Tavira (in the Algarve) and sent an urgent message to Peter to inform him of what had happened. The regent immediately dispatched instructions ordering Castro's son, √Ålvaro de Castro, to take over his father's credentials, proceed to Ceuta and fulfill the mission.Pina Chr. Afonso V, (v.1, pp. 112‚Äì13) In the meantime, unaware of Castro's fate, Tavora and Eanes arrived in Asilah to inform Abu Bakr of the undertaking. Abu Bakr immediately dispatched Master Joseph to Fez to request and arrange the transfer of Ferdinand and his entourage back to Asilah to be handed over to the Portuguese emissaries.Monumenta Henricina, vol. VI, p. 176n Master Joseph arrived in Fez in May 1440 and presented Abu Zakariya with sealed letters from Peter of Coimbra that contained copies of the order for Noronha's dismissal and the evacuation instructions given to Fernando de Castro. What happened thereafter is murky. Ferdinand himself was called to an audience before Abu Zakariya, with Joseph present, to be asked if he wanted to return to Asilah. While escorting Ferdinand back to his dungeon, Abu Zakariya's guards \\"found\\" a secret note on him, which they said Master Joseph had slipped to him during the audience.√Ålvares (p. 187) Master Joseph was accused of a scheming to help Ferdinand escape and was promptly detained. √Ålvares believes this was all a ruse by Abu Zakariya to gain some time.√Ålvares, p. 188 Abu Zakariya sought to reap the glory of recovering Ceuta and needed time to assemble an army in Fez for a triumphal march on Ceuta. In September 1440, once the army was assembled, Master Joseph was finally released and sent back to Asilah without Ferdinand, carrying only Abu Zakariya's promise to undertake the swap himself, i.e. that he would personally take Ferdinand to Ceuta and release him upon taking control of the city.√Ålvares (pp. 189‚Äì90); Pina, Chr. Afonso V (v.1, [p. 112]) It is uncertain what else Joseph reported about Abu Zakariya's intentions, but the Portuguese ambassadors rejected the change of plan, arguing that they were not prepared to \\"hock Ceuta for paper promises\\"\\"q elles n√£o tomari√£o em penhor da Cidade peda√ßos de papel\\", √Ålvares (p. 193) and that they needed to have some sort of hold on Ferdinand's person before the city was delivered. Abu Zakariya's column had set out from Fez in September 1440, with Ferdinand in tow, but they did not get far.√Ålvares (p. 191) Only now hearing of Castro's death and receiving the vigorous reply from the ambassadors in Asilah, they paused, and after some deliberation, Abu Zakariya called off the march and returned to Fez in October. (Reports of the mobilization of Moroccan arms for the march to Ceuta caused alarm in Portugal. Fearing that Abu Zakariya intended to take Ceuta by force, preparations immediately began to send an armed Portuguese fleet to reinforce Ceuta;Monumenta Henricina, Vol. 6, p. 176n it is uncertain if the fleet was actually sent, but news of the preparation of fresh troops would likely have been received in Fez, sending mixed signals about Portuguese intentions.) Negotiations resumed, this time swirling around potential hostage-swapping and material guarantees to supplement verbal promises. But there was little trust between the parties. In early November, the Nasrid sultan Muhammad IX of Granada stepped in and offered to break the impasse. He proposed that Ferdinand be placed in the hands of a group of Genoese merchants under his jurisdiction, giving his solemn promise to Abu Zakariya that he would not allow them to hand Ferdinand over to the Portuguese until the evacuation of the city was confirmed.√Ålvares (p. 196) The Portuguese did not give an immediate reply to Granada's offer. An outbreak of pestilence in Morocco in early 1441 delayed matters further.√Ålvares (p. 201) Three of the four noble hostages that had remained in Asilah (separately from Ferdinand in Fez) ‚Äì Jo√£o Gomes de Avelar, Pedro de Ata√≠de and Aires da Cunha ‚Äì died of the plague at this time.√Ålvares (pp. 203, 207) (In a curious note, when the Moroccans asked Ferdinand how Christians dealt with the plague, Ferdinand replied that \\"they removed themselves from places where people were dying of it\\", a reply which was reportedly received with derisive laughter.\\"E perguntav√£o-lhoes os Mouros que remedio fazi√£o os Christ√£os para a peste. E quando ouvi√£o dizer, que se apartav√£o dos lugares, em que della morri√£o, ri√£o-se delles como de necios\\" (√Ålvares, p. 201).) By September 1441, the disappointing news arrived of the breakdown of Granada's offer, and Ferdinand was once again clapped in leg irons.√Ålvares (p. 225) Whatever hope remained for a peaceful solution was dashed a few months later in March 1442. According to √Ålvares,√Ålvares, Ch. 31, p. 230 the Moroccan noble Faquy Amar (tutor of a Marinid prince) was arrested that month by Abu Zakariya's men, and on his person were found several Portuguese letters originating from Queen Eleanor's council that outlined a hare-brained scheme to break Ferdinand out of prison.√Ålvares (pp. 231, 235) Faquy Amar was brutally flogged in Ferdinand's presence and subsequently executed along with his conspirators.Alvares (p. 236) It was now clear to Abu Zakariya that the Portuguese had no intention to yield Ceuta and that nothing remained to do with Ferdinand but to extract the largest cash ransom that he could get. Negotiations ensued with the prisoners. Ferdinand put it out that he might be able to raise a total ransom of 150,000 dubloons (dobras) and the release of 150 Muslim prisoners for the release of himself and his companions.√Ålvares (p. 235) Ferdinand was subsequently separated from the rest of his entourage.√Ålvares (Ch. 32 p. 237) He was moved to a new small dark, windowless cell ‚Äì more accurately, an empty weapons storeroom in the qasr of Fez, where he could be more closely guarded.√Ålvares (pp. 240‚Äì41) Only his physician Master Martinho was allowed to see him. The rest of the entourage remained in the palace dungeon and were assigned to hard labor, principally in the stables and roadwork, but occasionally also in the castle, where they might exchange words with Ferdinand through a crevice in the wall.√Ålvares (ch.34) Abu Zakariya raised his price to 400,000 dubloons and 400 prisoners and asked Ferdinand to inquire of it from his relatives.√Ålvares (p. 249 But the reply from Portugal, which came four months later, said it was far too much, that they could afford 50,000, but offered to dispatch the ambassador Vasco Fernandes to negotiate a comprehensive ransom, which would include the son of Salah ibn Salah, and the pair still being held in Asilah (the surviving Aviz knight Gomes da Silva and Pero Rodrigues, who was the stand-in for his father, Rodrigo Esteves).√Ålvares (p. 250) The reply infuriated Abu Zakariya, particularly the codicil that implied the son of Salah ibn Salah would have a say in the negotiations over Ferdinand. The son of Salah arrived in Fez three months later to open talks, but he was brusquely received and nothing more came of it. Ferdinand was reportedly depressed and exasperated with his relatives; at one point he refused to hear any more news from Portugal.√Ålvares (pp. 245‚Äì46) His companions duly kept from him the news of the death of his brother John of Reguengos in 1442.√Ålvares (p. 262)  Death  Ferdinand's isolation in Fez continued. He only met his physician at mealtimes and his chaplain once every two weeks. By bribing the guards, he was sometimes allowed to meet other members of his entourage. He was not assigned to labor like the others, but spent his days largely confined to his cell, praying and writing prayers.√Ålvares (pp. 255‚Äì56) After fifteen months in these conditions, Ferdinand fell ill on 1 June 1443√Ålvares (p. 263) and died a few days later, on 5 June.√Ålvares(p. 277); on the exactness of the June 5th date, see the 1473 letter of √Ålvares, reproduced in Saraiva (1925: pp. 102‚Äì03) According to his hagiographers, on the evening before his death, Ferdinand reported seeing a vision of the Virgin Mary, the St. Michael the Archangel and St. John the Evangelist.√Ålvares (Ch. 37) After his death, the Fez authorities had Ferdinand's corpse embalmed with salt, myrtle and bay leaves. Ferdinand's heart, organs and intestines were taken out in the process (and promptly acquired by his fellow prisoners, who hid them in clay pots buried underground in a corner of their dungeon).√Ålvares, (Ch. 39) Ferdinand's naked and disemboweled corpse was subsequently hung upside down from the battlements of the walls of Fez for public display.√Ålvares (p. 295) After four days, the body was placed in a sealed wooden coffin and once again hung from the same battlements \\"for a long time\\".√Ålvares (ch.40, pp. 302‚Äì03.) In his hagiography, Alvares reports several \\"miracles\\" subsequently attributed to the coffin.√Ålvares (ch.42) Ferdinand was unmarried and childless at the time of his death. The lay mastership of his Order of Aviz was passed to his nephew Peter, Constable of Portugal (the son of Peter of Coimbra). = Fate of companions = Many members of Ferdinand entourage died in prison in the subsequent years, primarily of disease. Their fates, according to Frei Jo√£o √Ålvares, in chronological order, came as follows:√Ålvares (p. 306 and p. 310) * Frei Gil Mendes, the confessor, died in Asilah in the winter of 1437‚Äì38. * Rodrigo Esteves, head of household, fell ill and was released from Asilah in 1438 in return for his son Pedro Rodrigues * Diogo Delgado, Portuguese prisoner in Fez, was the first to die in Fez, sometime between 1443 and 1448 * Jo√£o de Luna, hearth-keeper, died in Fez, 1443‚Äì48 * Mestre Martim, the physician, died in Fez, 1443‚Äì48. * Fern√£o Gil, the wardrobe-keeper, died in Fez, 1443‚Äì48. * Jo√£o Louren√ßo, the quartermaster, died in Fez, 1443‚Äì48. * √Ålvaro Eanes of Alverca, the other Portuguese prisoner in Fez, converted to Islam * Crist√≥v√£o de Luvi√ßa Alem√£o, pantry-keeper, converted to Islam * Frei Jo√£o √Ålvares, the secretary, ransomed by Peter of Coimbra in 1448 * Jo√£o Vasques the cook, ransomed by Peter of Coimbra or Jo√£o de Lisboa in 1448. * Jo√£o Rodrigues, the colla√ßo, chamberlain, ransomed by Frei Jo√£o √Ålvares in 1450 * Pero Vasques, the chaplain, ransomed by Frei Jo√£o √Ålvares in 1450 Of the hostages that remained in Asilah, these were their fates: * Jo√£o Gomes de Avelar, noble knight of Fernando's house, died of plague in early 1441. * Aires da Cunha, household knight, died of plague, late 1441. * Pedro de Ata√≠de, household knight, died of plague, late 1441 * Gomes da Cunha/Silva, Aviz knight, commendador of Noudar, survived up to 1442, fate uncertain thereafter. * Pedro Rodrigues, son and stand-in for his father Rodrigo Esteves, survived up to 1442, fate uncertain thereafter.  Saintly cult  Ferdinand's tomb at House of Aviz necropolis in Batalha Monastery. Set up in 1443, Ferdinand's organs were deposited here in 1451, his bodily remains in 1472-73. News of Ferdinand's death was met with great mourning in Portugal. The regent Peter of Coimbra, who had perhaps done the most to get Ferdinand released, ransomed some of the imprisoned members of his party, notably Ferdinand's secretary, Frei Jo√£o √Ålvares, in 1448. Shortly after arriving in Lisbon, √Ålvares returned to Morocco in 1450 to ransom the remaining prisoners.√Ålvares (p. 311‚Äì12 √Ålvares also had hoped to ransom Ferdinand's remains, but he only managed to recover the hidden pot with Ferdinand's entrails. He returned to Lisbon and made his way to the court of King Afonso V of Portugal in Santar√©m in early June 1451.√Ålvares (p. 319) Frei Jo√£o √Ålvares and Jo√£o Rodrigues were instructed to take the relics and deposit them in the prepared tomb reserved for Ferdinand in the Aviz necropolis, the Founder's Chapel in Batalha Monastery.Alvares (ch.42, p. 320). √Ålvares reports that on the way to Batalha, they passed through Tomar, where Prince Henry the Navigator joined the procession and subsequently led the religious ceremony depositing the relics at Batalha. The tomb was originally carved with Ferdinand's personal arms and knightly motto le bien me plet (\\"Good pleases me\\"), which combined the motto of his father, por bem, with that of his mother, il me plait.Inchbold, Mrs. Stanley (1908), Lisbon & Cintra: with some account of other cities (1908), p. 210 A popular saintly cult soon developed around the figure of Ferdinand, encouraged by the ruling House of Aviz.For more on the emergence of the Ferdinand cult, see Saraiva (1925), Calado (1964), Fontes (2000), Russell (2000), Rebelo (2002), Rodrigues (2003) and Amaral (2009). In January 1444, Peter of Coimbra endowed a fund for a yearly mass to be said in Ferdinand's honor at his chapel in Batalha.Saraiva (1925: pp. 111‚Äì12) Henry the Navigator commissioned a triptych of the life and sufferings of Ferdinand, painted by Jo√£o √Åfonso, to be set up in his own (Henry's) chapel. Some modern authors believe the celebrated Saint Vincent Panels by Nuno Gon√ßalves were commissioned by Peter of Coimbra as a funerary homage to Ferdinand the Holy Prince.e.g. Saraiva (1925), Almeida and Albuquerque (2000). The religious iconography of Ferdinand the Holy Prince usually portrays him as a miserable prisoner, hungry, bearded, disheveled in a black cloak and hood,Hunger is frequently mentioned in Frei Jo√£o √Ålvares's c. 1460 chronicle. √Ålvares also describes him as dressed in a black robe and long black cloak (145), and is referred to as having a beard (p. 208) his feet in leg irons and chains held in his hands.Ferdinand's lifting of his chains to walk is mentioned in √Ålvares (p. 135) He also sometimes holds a hoe, for his labors in the palace gardens in Fez.e.g. √Ålvares (pp. 135, p. 142) Later on, Ferdinand was sometimes depicted in the armor of an imperial warrior e.g. in Antonio de Vasconcellos's 1621 Anacephalaeoses (p. 174), which Vasconcellos claims was copied from an image at Ferdinand's own tomb in Batalha, but \\"he is depicted there in a vulgar outfit, whereas here we depict him with the armor of a warrior.\\" (p. 194). The promotion of the saintly cult, in particular the narrative twist that Ferdinand had \\"volunteered\\" for martyrdom rather than allow Ceuta to be surrendered, was principally due to Henry the Navigator and may have been motivated by an attempt to deflect responsibility for his death away from himself.Russell (2000: pp. 189; 192‚Äì95) In the 1450s, Henry commissioned Frei Jo√£o √Ålvares to set down the details of Ferdinand's life and captivity. Finished sometime before 1460, and first published in 1527, the √Ålvares chronicle is the principal source of the life and travails of Ferdinand.Frei Jo√£o √Ålvares (c. 1460) Tratado da vida e dos feitos do muito vertuoso Senhor Infante D. Fernando, first published 1527 and then again in 1577. It was republished in 1730 under the new title Chronica dos feytos, vida, e morte do infante santo D. Fernando, que morreo em Fez.(online) Although originally intended as a piece of Christian hagiography to supplement the cult of the \\"Holy Prince\\" and the Henrican interpretation, the √Ålvares chronicle did not flatter Henry's leadership nor absolve him of responsibility for Ferdinand's fate. He makes it reasonably clear that Ferdinand did not seek out a martyr's fate, but had it imposed on him by the delays and machinations back in Portugal.Russell (2000: p. 190); Rodrigues (2003) At several points, √Ålvares surreptitiously points an accusatory finger at Ferdinand's brothers via speeches from the mouth of Ferdinand, his companions and his captors.e.g. √Ålvares (pp. 93, 179, 222, 233, 245, 293, 301) Another hagiography, the Martirium pariter et gesta, written by an unknown author, appeared around the same time or shortly after.Martirium pariter et gesta magnifici ac potentis Infantis Domini Fernandi, magnifici ac potentissimi Regis Portugalie filii, apud Fez pro fidei zelo et ardore et Christi amore. Vatican Latin Codex 3643. Rebelo (2002) dates this codex sometime between 1451 and 1471, leaning towards the latter end. Some have speculated the Martirium might have been written by Pero Vasques, the ransomed chaplain, although others believe it was a largely derivative piece, hurriedly written by someone else, commissioned by Isabella of Burgundy to support the campaign in Rome to promote Ferdinand to sainthood.Rebelo (2002) Ferdinand the Holy Prince, from the Martirium pariter et gesta (Vat. Lat. Codex 3634) Ferdinand's sister Isabella of Portugal, Duchess of Burgundy, endowed a mass to be said in Brussels, and in 1467 decided to fund a chapel dedicated to Ferdinand the Holy Prince at the Church of St. Anthony in Lisbon. To this end, Isabella dispatched Frei Jo√£o √Ålvares to Rome to petition the pope for religious honors for her brother, possibly even beatification, the first step to formal sainthood. At √Ålvares's request, bulls were issued by Pope Paul II in 1470 granting permission for the Lisbon chapel and indulgences to anyone who attended an anniversary mass for Ferdinand.For a copy of the bull of Pope Paul II, dated January 4, 1470, see S√£o Boaventura (1836: App. 1) Although a contract was signed between √Ålvares and Lisbon municipal authorities in November 1471 to begin the chapel, the death of both Paul II and Isabella around this time probably prevented the campaign from going forward, with the result that Ferdinand remained unbeatified and uncanonized.Saraiva (1925: pp. 109‚Äì10), Cristino (1991), Rebelo (2002), Amaral (2009). Oddly, Henry Brock, the author of the article on Ferdinand in the 1911 Catholic Encyclopedia (), says Ferdinand was beatified in 1470. This is an error. The process was stopped in its tracks with Paul II's death. As reported later, \\"O Infante Santo ... n√£o he canonizado nem beatificado\\" (L. de Sousa, Historia de S. Domingos, 1623: p. 644). See also the official website of the Diocese of Leiria-Fatima. King Afonso V of Portugal is reported to have invoked the memory of the martyrdom of his uncle in his three Moroccan campaigns of 1458, 1463/4 and 1471.French chronicler Jean de Wavrin relates a speech to this effect by Afonso V before the walls of Asilah in 1471, \\"et mesmement avoient fait morir en prison, inhaminement, contre tout honneur, le tres catholicque prince l'infant don Ferrant, son oncle, frere au roy defunct son pere, qu'ilz tenoient , pour certaines causes, hostagier en ycelle ville d'Azille...'Haa! quanteffois, et √° com grant regret me vient au devant, toutes fois que je vois ce pays, la doulent prison de nostre tres am√© oncle (l'infant don Fernant] avec sa plourable mort, etc.\\" (J. de Wavrin, Anchiennes Cronicque d'Engleterre (1863 Paris ed., v.3: pp. 85‚Äì96) In the last campaign, the conquest of Asilah, Afonso finally captured Tangier. In the aftermath, negotiations were opened between Afonso and the Moroccan strongman Muhammad al-Sheikh to deliver the bones and bodily remains of Ferdinand, which were still in Fez. These negotiations dragged on for a while, but the remains were finally obtained by the Portuguese in 1473 (or perhaps 1472)The 1473 date is reported in Ruy de Pina's Chronica de D. Afonso V (ch. 83, Ch.172). But many scholars claim it was a little earlier, in 1472 or perhaps even 1471 (e.g. Rodrigues 2003). One version relates that a disgruntled Moroccan courtier, said to be the ruler's own nephew, seized the coffin containing Ferdinand's body, smuggled it out of Fez, and brought it all the way to Lisbon to sell to the Portuguese king for a considerable sum.This story is related in a final note by an unknown author appended to the 1577 edition of √Ålvares's Chronica (Ch.43). It is also given in Ruy de Pina's chronicle (ch.172). See Rodrigues (2003: p. 47) There were subsequently great ceremonies in depositing the bodily remains in Ferdinand's tomb in Batalha. The cult of Ferdinand continued into the 16th and 17th centuries. King Manuel I of Portugal had the sculptor Nicolau Chanterene sculpt a statue of Ferdinand on the left side of the magnificent western door of the Jer√≥nimos Monastery c. 1517.Saraiva (1925: pp. 126‚Äì27) In 1538‚Äì39, in accordance with an endowment of the late dowager-queen Eleanor of Viseu (the widow of John II) a retable was commissioned depicting the life and sufferings of Ferdinand, painted by Crist√≥v√£o de Rodrigues, to be set up in Ferdinand's chapel at Batalha (alas this retable has long since disappeared).Saraiva (1925: pp. 116, 127‚Äì29) The saintly cult of the Ferdinand the Holy Prince fell foul of the ever-stricter rules of the Catholic Church, which sought to discourage cults of unbeatified and uncanonized persons. The only clear evidence of the presence of the Ferdinand cult inside a regular church outside the Batalha chapel was the retable dedicated to Ferdinand set up at the church of Our Lady of the Olive Grove in Guimar√£es in 1472, in celebration of the imminent translation of the relics.Saraiva (1925: p. 115). See the letter, dated 4 November 1473, from Frei Jo√£o √Ålvares to the head of the Guimar√£es church (reproduced in Saraiva, 1925: p.102-03). In 1614, Martim Afonso Meixa, Bishop of Leiria, prohibited the Ferdinand cult at Batalha on account of his not being beatified.Cristino (1991:p.90); Amaral (2009). The official website of the Diocese of Leiria- Fatima continues to list Ferdinand the Holy, but only as an unbeatified \\"popular cult\\" figure. Nonetheless, the 1595 hagiography by Jer√≥nimo Rom√°nJer√≥nimo Rom√°n, Historia de los dos religiosos de Portugal(1595: online) and the 1623 history written by Frei Lu√≠s de Sousa Frs. Lu√≠s de Cacegas and Lu√≠s de Sousa, Historia de S. Domingos (1623,Chs. 27‚Äì32 (p.667-81) (note: this was written by Fr. Lu√≠s de Sousa on the basis of material collected earlier by Fr. Luis de Cacegas at the convent of St. Dominic in Benfica.) tried to encourage it, suggesting masses for Ferdinand the Holy could be carried out subsumed in masses for All Saints. Jorge Cardoso included him in his Agiol√≥gio Lusitano (1666).Cardoso (1666: pp. 543‚Äì550). Cardoso also compiled a useful bibliography of Ferdinand-related works (pp. 559‚Äì61) The 1634 papal encyclical Coelestis Hierusalem issued by Pope Urban VIII prohibited popular cults of unbeatified and uncanonized persons \\"unless they proved to be of time immemorial\\". The Bollandists used this clause to insert Ferdinand the Holy Prince in the \\"June 5th\\" entry of their Acta Sanctorum in 1695, controversially including a rare image of him with a halo.\\"Die Quinta Junii De Sancto Principe Ferdinando, filio Ioannis I Lusitaniae regis, magistro equitum avisii, ordinis cisterc., fessa in Maurica captivitate defuncto, at ad Bataliense prope Leriam in Portugallia coenobium translato\\" in Acta Sanctorum Junii (June, volume 1), 1695 ed., vol. 20 pp. 561‚Äì91 Monument of the Discoveries, in Lisbon, Portugal. Restrictions on the religious cult did not prevent the continuation of a secular cult of Ferdinand, connected to the narrative that Ferdinand was a voluntary martyr for Portugal's imperial mission. The Portuguese poet Lu√≠s de Cam√µes made a brief mention of Ferdinand in his epic 1572 poem Os Lus√≠adas (Canto IV, stanzas 52‚Äì53), asserting Ferdinand had given himself to martyrdom voluntarily for patriotic reasons, \\"a sacrifice to love of country made, that not for him strong Ceuta be o'erthrown, the public weal preferring to his own.\\"See the bilingual Aubertin translation (1878‚Äì84), The Lusiads of Camoens 4.51‚Äì52 Perhaps surprisingly, the Fernandine legend got another gust of wind after the 1580 Iberian Union with Spain. The Spanish playwright composed a drama La Fortuna Adversa del Infante D. Fernando de Portugal in 1595‚Äì98 (sometimes attributed to Lope de Vega), which was probably the basis for the more famous 1629 Baroque play El pr√≠ncipe constante by Calder√≥n.Original Spanish version can be found in El principe constante (Maccoll ed., 1888). For an English translation, see D.F. McCarthy's \\"the Constant Prince\\" in Dramas of Calderon (1853: v.1). See also Rodrigues (2003) , the exiled Archbishop of Evora published a more modern version of Ferdinand's story in 1836.S√£o Boaventura (1836), first published in Modena. Its appendix provides a useful collection of references to Ferdinand by other authors in the 16th century. In English, the story of Ferdinand the Holy Prince was told in an 1842 poem \\"The Steadfast Prince\\" by Richard Chenevix Trench\\"The Steadfast Prince\\" in C.R. Trench (1842) Poems from Eastern Sources, pp. 125‚Äì72 The story was also turned into a 19th-century pulp historical fiction novel, The Constant Prince, by Christabel Rose Coleridge.Coleridge (1879, online) The Ferdinand legend received another lift in the 20th century, particularly encouraged by the Portuguese Estado Novo, which was keen on cultivating icons of nationalism and overseas glory.Amaral (2009) Ferdinand the Holy Prince was given a position of prominence on the Padr√£o dos Descobrimentos, a monument erected in 1960 to celebrate the Age of Discovery and (more generally) the Portuguese Empire.

Etymology The name Brehon's Chair refers to a Victorian idea that the monument was a seat of judgement used by a Brehon (an Anglicisation of breitheamh (earlier brithem), the Irish word for a judge) to administer the Brehon Laws that governed everyday life and politics in Ireland, until the Norman invasion of 1171 and in places until much later. The laws were written in the Old Irish period (ca. 600 ‚Äì 900 AD) and probably reflect the traditional laws of pre-Christian Ireland. These secular laws continued to exist in parallel with, and sometimes in conflict with, Canon law, throughout the early Christian period. Druid's Chair reflects similar ideas with regard to a Celtic religious aspect. These ideas are not historically accurate, the monument actually dating from prehistoric times, between 500 and 2500 BCE. Location The monument is located in the townland of Taylorsgrange, and is sometimes known as the Taylor's Grange Dolmen. It is situated on a green within a gated housing development on a hillside off the Kellystown Road, in southern Rathfarnham, overlooking Dublin's M50 orbital motorway. Beyond is College Road, and to the south is Danesmoate House and its residual demesne, owned by Adam Clayton of U2. The site is passed by the Little Dargle River, a tributary of the River Dodder. Structure and history The monument comprises three granite stones, now roughly in the shape of a chair. When the ground around the monument was excavated, flint tools were among the artefacts found there. As noted above, this stone structure is often mis-described as having been a chair, or a druidic site. However, excavation and study has found it to be what remains of a passage tomb, similar, on a small scale, to that of Newgrange and the other Boyne Valley monuments, and also other historical sites in the Dublin Mountains, such as at Mount Venus. The two side or portal stones, and high, formed a basic door frame with the third, rear, stone being the door stone. There would probably have been a substantial cairn built up behind the major stones. When originally built, the tomb may once have been a place of spiritual and ceremonial, and possibly astrological, importance. The monument was within the demesne lands of Glynsouthwell or Glen Southwell, now known as Danesmoate House. =Modern development= Planning permission for 48 houses south of the monument site was granted in the 1980s, and under a newer permission, two groups of detached houses, within a gated compound, were built southwest and southeast of the monument in 1998. In connection with these explorations of housing potential, archaeological investigations were undertaken in the 1989/1990 season. Following years of discussion and dispute, a final planning decision by An Bord Plean√°la in 2018 allowed for the construction of 5 more houses some distance south of the monument. The lands further south are barred to development, and all applications have avoided impinging on the monument's immediate vicinity, including the area between it and the motorway.

Chumbley (15 September 1967 ‚Äì 15 September 2004) was an English practitioner and theorist of magic, and a writer, poet and artist. He was Magister of the UK-based magical group Cultus Sabbati.Evans (2007), p. 212 Career Chumbley published several limited edition books through his private press Xoanon Publishing, and had many articles printed in occult magazines. Their subject was the doctrine and practice of a tradition of sorcery which he called 'Sabbatic Craft', a term which, according to Chumbley, \\"describes the way in which elements of witch-lore, Sabbath mythology and imagery were being employed in the cunning-craft tradition into which I was originally inducted\\".\\"An Interview With Andrew D. Chumbley\\", The Cauldron no. 103, February 2002. He claimed that this tradition was founded in two lineages of traditional witchcraft, both pre-dating \\"those modern revivalist forms of witchcraft, which have become generically nominalised as 'wicca'\\".Chumbley, Andrew, \\"Hekas\\", The Cauldron no. 74, November 1994. Chumbley's early articles were published in the chaos magic journal Chaos International; later articles appeared in Starfire, journal of the Typhonian OTO, and in the long- established British witchcraft journal The Cauldron. Daniel A. Schulke succeeded him as Magister of Cultus Sabbati. Personality In an obituary his close friend Michael Howard, a well-known occult writer and publisher of The Cauldron, described Chumbley as \\"a man of the land, rural in both birth and character. He fitted totally within the traditional archetypal parameters of the English (and specifically Essex) cunning man.\\" Howard recalled Chumbley‚Äôs kindness, generosity and sense of humour: \\"To outsiders Andrew could sometimes appear to be aloof, intense and serious to the point of obsession... However, if he met kindred spirits of sincerity and honour, who shared his interests and serious intent, he would willingly go out of his way to offer them help and guidance on the Path... In fact he was a natural teacher and, like all good occult teachers, acted as a catalyst in the lives of his students.\\"Howard, M., 'Andrew D. Chumbley', The Cauldron no. 114, November 2004. Influences Although Chumbley was mainly known for his involvement with English traditional witchcraft,Hutton, Ronald, The Triumph of The Moon, Oxford University Press 2001. primarily that of East Anglia,Chumbley, Andrew, \\"What is Traditional Craft?\\", The Cauldron no. 81, August 1996. Online text at . his occult interests and influences were extremely diverse. According to Schulke, \\"Chumbley's magical work spanned many fields of sorcerous influence, including Sufism, left-hand Tantra and Petro Voodoo\\".Schulke, Daniel A. \\"Way and Waymark\\", The Cauldron no. 122, November 2006. Other influences included the artist-occultist Austin Osman SpareEvans (2007), p. 213: \\"The 'sabbatic craft' mentioned is Andrew's version of a synthesis of witchcraft and the methods of Austin Osman Spare...\\" and author- occultist Kenneth Grant. Chumbley was familiar with and respected Grant's work and was a member of Grant's Ordo Templi Orientis from 1993 to 1999,Evans (2007), p. 339 operating an affiliated magical lodge.Chumbley, Andrew, 'Opening the Way for the Daemons of the Void', Starfire Vol. II, No. 2, 1998. Spare's philosophy of the Kia almost certainly influenced the \\"non-dual gnosis\\" which is a key element in Chumbley's system, although the similar \\"doctrine of the void\\" (Shunyavata), a foundation concept of Tantrism, is also likely to have affected Chumbley's work through the Uttara Kaula Sampradaya, of which he claimed to be an initiate.Chumbley, Andrew, 'The Golden Chain and the Lonely Road: a typological study of Initiatory Transmissions within the Sabbatic Tradition', The Cauldron no. 94, November 1999. In The Azo√´tia Chumbley presents \\"Will, Desire, Belief\\" as a threefold unity operating in sorcery; this is ultimately derived from Spare's work, although the primary textual source is Grant.Grant, Kenneth, Images & Oracles of Austin Osman Spare, Muller 1975, Fulgur Limited 2005. The use of sigils and magical glyphs in Chumbley's work also suggests a derivation from Spare, though classical magical grimoires such as the Key of Solomon and the Go√´tia provide an earlier precedent. The Azo√´tia and Chumbley's subsequent writings demonstrate his familiarity with a broad range of Western esoteric doctrines including Qabalah, Enochian Magic, the magic of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and the Thelemic school of Aleister Crowley. Another influence was the neo- Sufi author Idries Shah, particularly his theories concerning possible connections between witchcraft and various near-eastern cults such as the Yezidi, Mandaeans, Sufis and Zoroastrians.These connections are proposed in Idries Shah quotes Daraul in The Sufis (1964), adding little, however 'Arkon Daraul' is widely thought to be one of the many pseudonyms of Shah. Chumbley addressed these themes, citing Shah's work, in his book Qutub: The Point (1995). Regarding his sources, drawn from both literature and direct contact with practitioners of other occult and religious traditions, Chumbley stated: \\"In all contexts one may find pieces of magical lore and belief from many disparate times and places, but all are brought to function within the trans- historical arena of the sacred dimension, whether it be the magical circle of Witcherie or the Ninefold Plot of Sigaldry.\\" Schulke observed that \\"Chumbley's grimoire Azo√´tia, though wholly a reification of traditional British witchcraft, makes use of Sumerian, Egyptian, Yezidi, Arabic, and Aztec iconography, among others.\\" Doctrine and method Chumbley's work promotes a doctrine of 'Transcendental Sorcery', founded on his belief that all forms of magic arise from a single source, which he termed the 'Magical Quintessence': \\"Magick is the transmutability of the Quintessence of all nature ... Sorcery is the knowledge of the universal points of transmutation. Its Art is to cultivate the ability to manipulate these foci of power in accordance with Will, Desire and Belief.\\" Chumbley considered the practice of willed dreaming essential as a means of interacting directly and consciously with the spiritual dimensions he called 'the High Sabbat'; according to him \\"Every word, deed and thought can empower, magnetise, and establish points of receptivity for a magical dream, likewise any of these means can do the opposite--fixating perception in a manner that is not receptive--that seals the soul in the body instead of enabling it to go forth at will.\\" In conjunction with dreaming and trance experience Chumbley used automatic writing and drawing to manifest the knowledge drawn from ritual magic; these procedures, in which the magician offers her or himself as a vehicle for the forces summoned instead of using another as medium, is uncommon in the Western occult tradition - one modern exemplar being Austin Osman Spare. The results of Chumbley's practices can be seen in his drawings and sigillisations. Chumbley believed that the natural manifestation of magical gnosis and power occurs through creative activity: \\"Dreaming and the mutual translation of dreamt ritual and ritual-as-dreamt form the basic rationale and context for our work. The active discourse between initiates and our spirit-patrons inspires and motivates this dreaming. This is demonstrably manifest in the magical artistry of individual initiates, whether through text, ritual performance, song, tapestry, craftsmanship, or image.\\"Occult Art Gallery website, see link below. Written and illustrated works =The Azo√´tia= Chumbley's first book The Azo√´tia was published privately by the author in 1992 as a softcover volume under the Xoanon imprint. The work received positive reviews from other contemporary practitioners including Jan FriesReview by Fries published in The Nuit-Isis Reader, Mandrake of Oxford, 1993. and Phil Hine.Review by Phil Hine published in Pagan News, London, June 1992. Described as \\"...a complete recension of Sabbatic theory and praxis, relating the Three Great Rites of Ingress, Congress, and Egress, together with a detailed exposition of the 22 Letters of the Sorcerer's Alphabet\\", the book forms a r√©sum√© of Chumbley's system and is the core text for practitioners wishing to study and practice the Sabbatic path of magic. A tenth anniversary edition, revised to include further textual and illustrative material was issued by Xoanon Publishing on October 31, 2002, as Azo√´tia (Sethos Edition). Part of the book's significance in modern occult literature lies in its conscious reinvention of the format of the \\"grimoire\\", or sorcerer's instruction book. Gavin Semple hailed The Azo√´tia as \\"a very different type of book; a genuine Grimoire, likely the only one to be published in modern times; [...] The Azo√´tia is a work of breathtaking power and passion, in whose pages magic is restored to its position as the Sacred Art, the Sabbatic Craft is revealed as a living and very vital tradition.\\"Semple, Gavin (1994) 'The Azo√´tia - reviewed by Gavin Semple', Starfire Vol. I, No. 2, 1994, p. 194. =Qutub: The Point= Qutub: The Point followed in 1995, published for Xoanon by Fulgur Limited, in which Chumbley combined illustrations and poetry with the intent of creating a telesmatic volume. The illustrations demonstrated that Chumbley's skills as a draughtsman were advancing quickly. The book was described as follows: \\"This work treats of the Arcanum of the Opposer, a magical formula of the Crooked Path concerning the Powers of Self-overcoming. The book consists of an arcane poetic text in 72 verses, a detailed commentary in critical prose, and a substantial glossary of esoteric terms and names. The whole is illustrated throughout with calligraphic and sigillic depictions of the Opposer's composite mysteries.\\" Issued in several different hard bindings as standard, deluxe and private editions, copies of Qutub included unique additions such as hand-drawn talismans or sigillised inscriptions. A second printing of Qutub, in two editions, was issued by Xoanon in March 2009. The standard edition is limited to 700 hardbound copies. The deluxe hardbound, slipcased edition is limited to 72 copies. Michael Staley, a senior member of the Typhonian OTO and editor of Starfire Magazine, described the Qabalistic concept of the book as follows: \\"Qutub is the Point. Its root, QTB, enumerates as 111. We have immediately the essence of the matter, since 'The Point' suggests Kether and 111 suggests Aleph, the Fool, Atu 0, etc. 'The Point' is the deliciously-sharp point of insight into the reality beyond and underlying its expression in terms of duality. The idea called forth by the correspondence with Atu 0 is that of the illumined adept who has experienced this Point, realised its imminence in everything and at all times, and who is thereby liberated whilst yet living. It is this delicious insight which is conveyed by the very best of 'mystical poetry'.\\" Staley credited Chumbley's poetry as \\"accomplished\\", but found it sometimes too long-winded.Staley, Michael (1996) 'Qutub - reviewed by Michael Staley', Starfire Vol. II, No. 1, 1996, p. 143. =ONE: The Grimoire of the Golden Toad= Numerous articles by Chumbley followed, published in British and American occult journals, but no further books appeared until ONE: The Grimoire of the Golden Toad in 2000, described by Xoanon as: \\"...the first full grimoire-text to treat specifically and from personal account of the Traditional East Anglian ritual called 'The Waters of the Moon': the solitary initiation of the so-called 'Toad-witch'.\\" The purpose of this traditional folk-magical rite is to obtain a specific bone from the flensed corpse of a toad; the bone is believed to bestow certain powers upon its owner, primarily control of animals. Chumbley's ONE, however, presents a thoroughly antinomian re-visioning of the ritual procedure and its results, combining ritual practice with a series of dramatic visions recounted in prose-poetry. In Chumbley's recension it becomes clear that the \\"animal\\" over which power is sought is the practitioner's own human self. Seventy-seven hand-bound copies of the book were offered for sale, each copy accompanied by a hand-written page of a sigillic \\"inner grimoire\\", signed by the author, and an envelope containing a hand-painted talisman made from antique toadskin leather and a single blackthorn. A further three copies were retained \\"for internal distribution\\"; these were bound in leather with an actual toad's head set into the front cover, with toadskin leather panelling on the rear.Xoanon website, see link below. =The Dragon Book of Essex= In the autumn of 2013 Publishers Xoanon announced that The Dragon Book of Essex will be published in Midwinter 2013. However, for undisclosed reasons publication date was pushed back to summer 2014.http://xoanon.co.uk/publications/the-dragon-book-of-essex/ The Dragon-Book of Essex was the intended second volume of a trilogy of Sabbatic grimoires, following Azoetia; it appears to be a very substantial work, described as \\"...a Compleat Grimoire of Crooked Path Sorcery, distilled from the many years of practice... Being the fruit of a decade of concentrated praxis in the Cultus' inner circle, this work is intended as an entire resum√© of the ancestral and ophidian components of Traditional Sorcery and Sabbatic Gnosis.\\" Ten copies were published circa 1998 as a private \\"initiatic\\" edition in three volumes totalling 1,200 pages. =Private and unpublished works= Other works by Chumbley are known to exist, but have not been issued; they were either unpublished at his death, or had been produced solely for private distribution. The Auraeon was referred to by Chumbley as a forthcoming volume concerning solitary initiation, of which he said: > In the Sabbatic Craft, solitary initiation or 'The Lonely Road' is > recognised as a vital aspect of every practitioner‚Äôs path and the > understanding of ‚Äòsolitude‚Äô is subject to many levels of interpretation. > Autonomy is the key virtue, irrespective of whether one practices in human > convocation or 'alone' ‚Äì in the ever-present company of spirits.\\" Another volume titled The Greene Gospel is referred to in a footnote to Michael Howard's The Book of Fallen Angels (Capell Bann, 2004) where it is identified as being privately distributed. Chumbley also created a series of singular artworks known as the 'Unique Transmission Series'. These were books which were individually hand-written and illustrated; according to the Xoanon website: \\"Each book is executed on hand-made paper, presented in a carved wooden box with accompanying telesmata and sealed letter to owner. Each text embodies a unique recension of a specific arcanum of the Crooked Path.\\" The full number of works in the series was not disclosed, however one example, The Red Grimoire, is known to have been purchased by Jack Macbeth (Orlando Britts), and was referenced by him in his privately published book The Totemic Invocation of the Shadow Selves, one of several recent books styled as \\"grimoires\\" that have followed in the wake of The Azo√´tia.

The fees to be paid to the patent office depend on the applicant's status. The statuses include the \\"large entity\\" status and the \\"small entity\\" status. The \\"micro entity\\" status is a further status, which was introduced with the Leahy‚ÄìSmith America Invents Act (AIA), enacted in 2011. The small entity status allows small businesses, independent inventors, nonprofit organizations to file a patent application and maintain an issued patent for a reduced fee--a 50% reduction. Under 13 C.F.R. ¬ß 121.802(a), an entity qualifies as a \\"small business concern\\", and so qualifies for small entity status, if its number of employees, including affiliates, does not exceed 500 persons. Small Business Administration (SBA) regulations, discussed below, define \\"employees\\" and \\"affiliates\\". If an organization or individual qualifies for small entity status, claiming such status is relatively simple. The person seeking such status needs to simply file a verified statement in the patent application prior to paying the first fee as a small entity. Any subsequent payments only need to include a statement where such status has changed. The concept of \\"small entity\\" also exist in other jurisdictions, such as in Canada.\\"...\\"small entity\\" means an entity that employs 50 or fewer employees or that is a university, but does not include an entity that is controlled directly or indirectly by an entity, other than a university, that employs more than 50 employees.\\" in Subsection 3.02 (2) of the (Canadian) Patent Rules Employees An entity, including its affiliates, may have up to 500 employees before being disqualified for small-entity status. Federal regulations define what persons qualify as employees and over what time periods employee counts are made. All individuals employed on a full-time, part-time, or other basis are counted in determining a business concern's number of employees. 13 C.F.R. ¬ß 121.106(a). This includes employees obtained from a temporary employee agency, professional employee organization or leasing concern. The totality of the circumstances, including criteria used by the IRS for Federal income tax purposes, are considered in determining whether individuals are employees of a concern. Volunteers (i.e., individuals who receive no compensation, including no in-kind compensation, for work performed) are not considered employees. Part-time and temporary employees are counted the same as full-time employees. ¬ß 121.106(b)(2). Where the number of employees fluctuates over the course of a year, the number of employees may be taken to be the average number of employees over the preceding 12 calendar months. ¬ß 121.106(b)(1). The average number of employees of a business concern with affiliates is calculated by adding the average number of employees of the business concern with the average number of employees of each affiliate. ¬ß 121.106(b)(4)(i). If a concern has acquired an affiliate or been acquired as an affiliate during the applicable period of measurement or before the date on which it self-certified as small, the employees counted in determining size status include the employees of the acquired or acquiring concern. Furthermore, this aggregation applies for the entire period of measurement, not just the period after the affiliation arose. The employees of a former affiliate are not counted if affiliation ceased before the date used for determining size. ¬ß 121.106(b)(4)(ii). This exclusion of employees of a former affiliate applies during the entire period of measurement, rather than only for the period after which affiliation ceased. Affiliates and control Small business concerns as defined by federal regulations for the purposes of receiving small-entity discounts on patent fees may have a maximum of 500 employees, including affiliates. Thus, a business concern that might otherwise qualify for small-entity status might be disqualified if it is affiliated with one or more other business concerns that cumulatively have more than 500 employees. Affiliation is determined under a control test. Concerns are \\"affiliates\\" of each other for the purposes of 13 C.F.R. ¬ß 121.802(a) when one concern controls or has the power to control the other, or a third party or parties controls or has the power to control both. 13 C.F.R. ¬ß 121.103(a)(1). It does not matter whether control is exercised, so long as the power to control exists. The test for determining control takes in account ownership, management, previous relationships with or ties to another concern, and contractual relationships. ¬ß 121.103(a)(2). The federal regulations that describe control set out a number of circumstances where control obviously exists, as where one entity owns more than 50% of the stock in another entity, ¬ß 121.103(c)(1), or where one or more officers, directors, managing members, or partners who control the board of directors and/or management of one concern also control the board of directors or management of one or more other concerns, ¬ß 121.103(e). There are also a number of \\"safe-harbor\\" exceptions to affiliation coverage found in 13 C.F.R. ¬ß 121.103(b), mostly involving ownership by certain kinds of investment companies, venture capital operating companies, Indian tribes, ¬ß 501(c) nonprofits like charitable trusts, foundations, endowments, etc. If the assignee of a patent application has difficulty determining for itself whether it qualifies for small-entity status, authorized SBA officials may make formal entity size determinations, based upon a specific patent application pursuant to USPTO rules. 13 C.F.R. ¬ß 121.803. Such determinations, which may be thought of as analogous to a private letter ruling issued by the IRS to resolve questions relating to federal taxation, are binding upon the parties. Other SBA opinions provided to patent applicants or others are only advisory, and are not binding or appealable. Effect of initial status determination during pendency of application Once a good faith determination of small entity status has been made and appropriately established with the USPTO, the lower small entity fees may be paid in the application without regard to change in status until the issue fee or maintenance fee is due. 37 C.F.R. ¬ß 1.27(g)(1). In practical terms, this rule relieves applicants and their representatives of the burdensome duty to constantly reevaluate the determination of an application's assignee organization(s)' small entity status(es) throughout the pendency of the application up to and until the issue fee is paid. Loss of status Small entity status is lost when the patent is licensed, exclusively or non- exclusively, or assigned to an organization that would not itself qualify for small entity status. Special care should be taken by an organization licensing technology to the government. Except for licenses under the Bayh‚ÄìDole Act, the government is not a small entity for these purposes and small entity status would be lost. If an organization (including affiliates) has fewer than 500 employees, an application data sheet may be filed, the box as a small entity may be checked, and subsequently the small entity fees may be paid until the patent is allowed or a maintenance fee on a resulting patent is due. At those points in time, the patent agent or attorney might need to send a notification of loss of small entity status.Paragraphs g(1) and g(2) of 37 C.F.R. 1.27 Micro entity status Changes to U.S. patent law in December 2012 created a sub-category of small entity status called \\"micro entity status\\"Federal Register, pages 75033‚Äì75034, 37 C.F.R. ¬ß 1.29 for inventors who qualify for small entity status, but also have a gross income less than three times the current gross median income and have applied for no more than four patents previously, or who have an association with an institution of higher education.December 19, 2012, Federal Register page 75034, left column Misrepresentation penalties and consequences Misrepresenting a firm's size status can result in suspension or disbarment, as well as civil and criminal penalties. 13 C.F.R. ¬ß 121.108(e). Moreover, all claims of a patent issued following an intentional misrepresentation of small entity status may be held to be unenforceable as the result of inequitable conduct, i.e., fraud upon the United States Patent and Trademark Office. See MPEP ¬ß 2016; 37 C.F.R. ¬ß 1.27(h). As long as any small-entity assertions are made without any intent to deceive, any improper assertion of small-entity status should not be considered fraud.

It is adjacent to the districts of Barnton, Cramond, Silverknowes, Blackhall and Corbiehill/House O'Hill. It was absorbed into Edinburgh as part of the boundary changes in 1920 and is part of the EH4 postcode area. Locals sometimes abbreviate the name to D'Mains.  Etymology  The place is named after William Davidson, a wealthy merchant who bought Muirhouse, east of the district, in 1776.http://www.grantonhistory.org/buildings/muirhouse.htm A mains is Lowland Scots for an estate farm or home farm. Prior to the 19th century, it was known as Muttonhole. Locals continued to use this name until at least 1860.Grants Old and New Edinburgh vol.5 p.110The origin of this name is unknown, though it perhaps refers to the local sheep farming industry. Muttonhole could also be derived from mort-toun-hole, another name for a \\"murder hole\\" (drowning pit). History The original village runs east-west and is still identifiable as the original village, with a series of modest cottages on each side of the road. Quality Street was added in 1827, designed by James Gillespie Graham. The church on Quality Street was built as Cramond Free Church in 1843 and is by David Cousin. The railway arrived late in 1894 but spurred villa development to the north and north-west.Buildings of Scotland : Edinburgh by Gifford, McWilliam and Walker  Description  Within the district there is a variety of shops and businesses, ranging from cobblers to large supermarkets, as well as food outlets of various kinds. The district is also served by four churches, a Tesco, 2 veterinary surgery, a doctor's surgery, two dental surgeries, the Corbie and other takeaways, a primary school and a Greggs. The state secondary school that serves the area is the Royal High School. Davidson's Mains Park is near the high school which has a play park and a football pitch.

Washington DC some north of Sandakan in Sabah, Malaysia.Sabah Parks: Turtle Islands National Park, retrieved 22 April 2011 It consists of 3 islands - Selingaan, Little Bakkungan and Gulisaan (often spelt with -an instead of the traditional -aan), including the surrounding coral reefs and ocean. The Park is noted for its green turtles and hawksbill turtles which lay their eggs on the beaches of the islands. The Park covers an area of 17.4 km¬≤. The name Turtle Islands, however, refers to 10 islands, 3 of which are part of Turtle Islands Park of Malaysia, and 7 which belong to the Turtle Islands Wildlife Sanctuary of Tawi-Tawi province, Philippines. On 1 August 1966, the first turtle hatchery in Malaysia was established on Selingan, funded entirely by the Sabah state government. Turtle hatcheries on the remaining two islands followed shortly after. In 1972, Selingan, Bakkungan Kechil and Gulisan were designated as a Game and Bird Sanctuary. In 1977, this status was upgraded to that of a Marine Park.Establishment of National Park was gazetted on 1 October 1977; Atlas of Philippine Coral Reefs; Turtle Islands Heritage Protected Area; by Fernando G. Romero Permanent park staff monitor the turtles, protect the hatcheries and tag the turtles for research purposes. Libaran Island is also designated within the park boundaries, however it is not a major turtle hatching spot. Turtle Islands Park is administered by Sabah Parks. Selingan Island Turtle breeding Only on Selingan are there chalets for overnight visitors, and those who wish to see the turtles laying eggs must stay overnight. A curious fact of the three islands is that turtles come ashore nightly, not only during certain seasons and thus one is virtually guaranteed to see them. During the peak season (October) up to 50 turtles come ashore to lay eggs. However, park rules and regulations are strictly enforced and visitors are not allowed on the beach from sunset to sunrise so as not to disturb the turtles. A ranger will call all visitors to observe only one turtle laying eggs per night. The eggs are collected and the visitors vacate the beach immediately so as not to scare away other turtles, which are very sensitive to movement on the beach. After the laying and collection of eggs, and eventual tagging of the turtle if it is a first-time visitor, tourists are allowed into the hatchery to observe the further work of the rangers: the transplantation of the freshly laid eggs into a man-made incubation chamber. The chamber is no different from that of the turtle: between 60‚Äì75 cm deep, in the sand, but within a protected hatchery to make it impossible for natural predators to dig the nests open. Since temperature determines the sex of the turtles part of the hatchery is shaded, while the rest remains under the open sun. After the transplantation of the eggs visitors will get turtle hatchlings ‚Äì baby turtles ‚Äì to release into the sea, which is also done by night to further increase their chances of survival. Not all nests are emptied by the park rangers, but some remain undisturbed and develop naturally. By conserving the turtles the park does not want to endanger other wildlife on the island: many animals that are natural predators of the turtles such as monitor lizards, a crab specialising in turtle hatchlings, eagles and other birds, and marine animals such as sharks. They need the turtles for their survival. The turtle conservation programme in Sabah is the oldest in the world and with the most detailed statistics and research. Marine turtles have been around for 230 million years at least, but because of human activities they have been brought, over the past hundred years, to the brink of extinction.

He served as the last American Consul General to Dhaka, Bangladesh (East Pakistan at the time). He is famous for sending the strongly worded \\"Blood Telegram\\" protesting against the atrocities committed in the Bangladesh Liberation War. He also served in Greece, Algeria, Germany, Afghanistan and ended his career as charge d'affaires of the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi, India, retiring in 1982. Early life and education Born in Chicago, Archer Blood graduated from high school in Lynchburg, Virginia. He received a bachelor's degree from the University of Virginia in 1943, then served in the U.S. Navy in the North Pacific in World War II. In 1947, he joined the Foreign Service, and received a master's degree in international relations from George Washington University in 1963.  Career  In 1970, Blood arrived in Dhaka, East Pakistan, as U.S. consul general. When the Bangladesh genocide began, his consulate regularly reported events as they occurred to the White House, but received no response due to America's alliance with West Pakistan, fuelled in part by President Nixon's personal friendship with the then-President of Pakistan, Yahya Khan, as well as by National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger's desire to use Pakistan's cordial relationship with China as a pathway to resuming American relations with China. Although Blood's initial cables failed to elicit a response from his government, they caused a stir with the American public when they were leaked, prompting Pakistan's foreign ministry to complain to the American government. With tensions in East Pakistan rising, Blood saw the independence of Bangladesh as an inevitability, remarking that \\"the ominous prospect of a military crackdown is much more than a possibility, but it would only delay, and ensure, the independence of [sic.] Bangla Desh.\\" After foreign journalists were rounded up and expelled from East Pakistan, Blood even sheltered a reporter who had snuck away so that events could continue to be reported, in addition to sheltering Hindu Bengalis being targeted by the West Pakistani forces, despite being warned by the American government to refrain from doing so. Blood also played a role in the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, though this may not have been known in the United States at the time. A report suggests that one of the two triggers for the invasion was \\"Amin‚Äôs reception of acting American Charg√© d‚ÄôAffaires Archer Blood on October 27\\" in 1979. =The Blood Telegram= right The Blood Telegram (April 6, 1971), sent via the State Department's Dissent Channel, was seen as the most strongly worded expression of dissent in the history of the U.S. Foreign Service.Dissent Channel in Foreign Affairs Manual 2 FAM 070 (PDF)Hitchens, Christopher. \\"The Trial of Henry Kissinger\\", 2002 It was signed by 20 members of the diplomatic staff. The telegram stated: In an earlier telegram (March 27, 1971), Archer Blood wrote about American observations at Dhaka under the subject heading \\"Selective genocide\\": Aftermath Although Blood was scheduled for another 18-month tour in Dhaka, President Richard M. Nixon and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger recalled him from that position since his opposition went against their hopes of using the support of West Pakistan for diplomatic openings to China and to counter the power of the Soviet Union. He was assigned to State Department's personnel office. Government officials in 1972 admitted that they didn't believe the magnitude of the killings, labeling the telegram alarmist. His career was greatly marred by the telegram. He wrote the book, The Cruel Birth of Bangladesh ‚Äì Memoirs of an American Diplomat, about his experience during the Bangladesh Liberation War. Archer Blood received the Christian A. Herter Award in 1971 for \\"extraordinary accomplishment involving initiative, integrity, intellectual courage and creative dissent\\". The Blood Telegram was also a precursor to the formation of the State Department 'Dissent Channel' that formed in the following years, a mechanism through which agency officials could express formal critiques of United States foreign policy.  Legacy  Blood died of arterial sclerosis on September 3, 2004, in Fort Collins, Colorado, where he had been living since 1993. His death made headlines in Bangladesh. Bangladesh sent a delegation to the funeral in Fort Collins and Mrs. Blood received numerous communiques from Bangladeshis. His contribution in shaping the moral contours of American diplomacy in 1971 was acknowledged by The Washington Post in its obituary. In May 2005, Blood was posthumously awarded the Outstanding Services Award by the Bangladeshi- American Foundation, Inc. (BAFI) at the First Bangladeshi-American Convention.Bangladeshi-American Foundation, Inc Mr. Blood received this Award for his role in 1970 and 1971 for the cause of humanity and his brave stance against the US official policy while the Pakistan army was engaged in a genocidal mission in what is now Bangladesh. His son, Peter Blood, accepted the award on behalf of the family. This was followed on December 13, 2005, by the dedication of the American Center Library, U.S. Embassy Dhaka, in the name of Archer K. Blood.

Released in December 2001, DarkSpace involves multiplayer spaceship combat between three player-controlled factions. DarkSpace takes place in a persistent universe, referred to in-game as \\"The MetaVerse\\", where players choose from several types of ships and fight for control of planets. It also uses instanced \\"Scenario\\" servers, where factions battle for control of a single solar system. DarkSpace has a long and varied development history. The game began as a small personal project, survived several deals with multiple publishers, and is run today by a mostly volunteer staff on an open sourced game engine. Gameplay Players begin by selecting one of three factions. Two factions are human: the United Galactic Trade Organization (UGTO) with sleek and well-rounded ships, and the Interstellar Cultural Confederation (ICC) with good long-range capabilities. Players can also choose the alien K'Luth, who pilot fast organic ships and are masters of hit and run tactics. DarkSpace also contains several non-player factions to interact with, such as the Machine Intelligence (MI) race, opportunistic space Pirates, and several other rare and bizarre alien entities. Players then choose a starship. DarkSpace has several types of ships, such as battleships, troop transports, supply vessels, and even space stations. Each ship type has different capabilities and plays a unique role in the game. Scout ships, for example, can reveal enemy positions, while heavy cruisers are built for attacking other ships. Players are not limited to a single ship that they \\"own\\"; they can return to a shipyard or home gate at any time and select a new ship.DarkSpace Manual. \\"5.4 Choosing Your Ship\\", Retrieved Feb 1 2010. Players can also store modified ship layouts in a personal storage \\"garage\\". Teamwork in action: Two K'luth dreadnoughts open fire, supported by a pair of stations. New players start with the rank of 'midshipman', and are restricted to the smallest ship types. To control larger ships the player must earn higher rankings by accumulating \\"Prestige Points\\", which are awarded for various tasks such as damaging enemy ships, bombing and capturing planets, building planetary structures, and repairing the ships of teammates. Most ships not only require a minimum rank but also one or more specific \\"badges\\" before they can be piloted. To fly a larger combat ship, for example, a player has to achieve the \\"Bronze Combat\\" badge by inflicting 50 points of damage to enemy ships. DarkSpace emphasizes tactical combat: players are able to finely control details of their ship's attack and defense maneuvers. It also emphasizes teamwork and organization: since most ships play very specialized roles, battles can often be won more easily and prestige earned more quickly if players work together as a team. In the larger scheme, faction control of areas in the MetaVerse requires coordination and communication between large groups of players. Multiple players: an ICC armada gathers to battle the UGTO. Although the game takes place in space and uses a 3D graphics engine, gameplay is restricted to a 2D dimensional plane. =Server types= DarkSpace uses several different types of servers to offer different modes of play. The main game is played out in \\"MetaVerse\\" servers, where planets remain in control of a faction until captured. The play area is spread over several star systems and game servers, but all players can travel to the same locations and battle over the same planets. DarkSpace also offers \\"Scenario\\" servers, which contain special plot events or time-limited battles. In scenarios players choose a faction and fight for control of a much smaller area - usually a single solar system. Different game setups and victory conditions may be used for each scenario - for example, factions normally at war may temporarily ally. When the victory conditions are met or when time has expired a winner is declared, prestige is awarded, and the scenario restarts. Plot DarkSpace establishes a fictional series of events detailing humanity's future progress into space. In the near future colonies are established on Luna and Mars, which then rebel and claim sovereignty. The United Galactics Trade Organization (UGTO) is formed and does a \\"complete survey, exploration, and colonization of the Sol system\\".\\"DarkSpace History\\", Retrieved Jan 29 2010. In 2049 the UGTO sends three ships to explore the Centauri system, where a small outpost is established. Many years of space exploration follow, with humans visiting 11 solar systems and colonizing 10. Human colonies are now so far from the Sol system that they fall outside of UGTO control. These systems became known as the Farstars. During the First Stellar Conflict the Farstar colonies fight for control of planets and resources but are eventually stopped by a UGTO police force. The UGTO attempt to shut down all independent shipyards, causing planets to rebel and begin the Second Stellar Conflict. After twenty years of war \\"the Sol loyal systems once again prevail over the Farstars due to their superior firepower\\". This is followed by three decades of uneasy peace. Finally, \\"in 2125 the Free Trade League formally declare[s] the Farstar systems an independent sovereign government henceforth to be known as the Interstellar Cultural Confederation (ICC) and revolution was begun.

However, several reviewers felt that the learning curve was too steep: Lafferty said \\"when first launched, the tutorial in DarkSpace was somewhat daunting\\", while Berntsen said \\"actually mastering the gameplay takes practice, and the initial learning curve can be somewhat steep\\" and Aaron Daigle from Game Chronicles claimed that \\"reading the manual and completing the tutorial mode are critical if you want to excel [at] or even just play the game\\".Daigle, Aaron. \\"DarkSpace Review\\", Game Chronicles, January 17, 2003.

Brett Todd thought that \\"the groundwork is being laid for DarkSpace to evolve into something special\\", and Lafferty said \\"[g]iven some time to grow, DarkSpace will likely be a sleeper hit\\".

Technology The login and chat system for DarkSpace uses a back-end system called GameCQ. GameCQ was similar to Blue Byte's portal software, the Blue Byte Game Channel, due to Richard Lyle having written much of the latter. However, as time has progressed GameCQ has developed into a completely different entity. The GameCQ system deals with all login requests, as well as session information and chat abilities via a process called the MetaServer. When a player connects to one of the available servers, details are passed between the MetaServer and the selected game node so as to authenticate that user. The game servers themselves are processes which are loaded with a game map. These can range from a single solar system to a collection of them linked by jumpgates. If one map is connected to another and both are located within separate servers, the MetaServer will facilitate the transition and authentication. DarkSpace has two forms of game mode, Scenario and the MetaVerse. Scenario being a single process loaded with a map that contains one solar system, and will rotate to the next based on win conditions.

It generates, mobilizes and deploys C-17 Globemaster III and KC-10 Extender aircraft. The 305th AMW is a tenant unit at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst in central New Jersey. It also controls one of the Air Force's busiest aerial ports, and the air operations at both McGuire Air Force Base and Naval Support Activity Lakehurst. The wing's motto is \\"Can Do,\\" a description formulated in World War II when its predecessor unit, the 305th Bombardment Group, earned its reputation as courageous, innovative warriors. The legendary 305th Bomb Group was first commanded by then-Colonel Curtis E. LeMay. The wing is the only Air Force unit with two Medal of Honor recipients ‚Äì Lieutenants William Lawley and Edward Michael, who earned them on separate B-17 missions during World War II. History : For additional history and lineage, see 305th Operations Group =305th Bombardment Wing= MacDill Air Force Base operations The 305th Bombardment Wing was established on 20 December 1950 and activated on 2 January 1951 at MacDill Air Force Base, Florida. The wing took charge of the 305th Bombardment Group's former flying squadrons when the Air Force reorganized its wings into the tri-deputate system. Initially training with the Boeing B-29 and B-50 Superfortress, the 305th received its first Boeing KC-97 Stratofreighter later that year. Following this, the group began training heavily in its new dual mission of strategic bombardment and aerial refueling. In June 1952, the wing became the second Strategic Air Command (SAC) wing to receive the Boeing B-47A Stratojet bomber. Operational squadrons of the wing were the 305th, 364th, 365th and 366th Bombardment Squadrons, while the 306th Bombardment Squadron was intended to act as a training unit to prepare future B-47 crews. The B-47As were primarily training aircraft and were not considered as being combat-ready, since most of them were unarmed and were initially without almost any of their vital electronic components In 1953, the 305th was upgraded to the B-47B production Stratojet and the wing began operational strategic bombardment and refueling missions from MacDill. The wing deployed overseas three times, once to England (September‚ÄìDecember 1953) and twice to North Africa (November 1955 ‚Äì January 1956 and January‚ÄìMarch 1957), in keeping with its mission of global bombardment and air-refueling operations. The wing's deployments marked the first overseas deployment of the B-47B. Two of the wing's B-47s set speed records on 28 July 1953 when one flew from RCAF Goose Bay, Labrador, to RAF Fairford, England, in 4:14 hours and the other flew from Limestone Air Force Base, Maine, to RAF Fairford in 4:45 hours. During this period, the 305th also figured prominently in the filming of the 1955 James Stewart and June Allyson film, Strategic Air Command, a portion of which was filmed in and around both the 305th Bombardment Wing and 306th Bombardment Wing areas and their B-47 aircraft at MacDill. In 1955, SAC upgraded the 305th to the B-47E, the major production version of the Stratojet. A major tragedy struck the 305th on the evening of 10 October 1956, when 50 of its personnel returning from a 90-day temporary duty assignment in England on a Military Air Transportation Service flight died when the United States Navy Douglas R6D-1 Liftmaster carrying them disappeared over the Atlantic Ocean. A search discovered wreckage from the aircraft, but no survivors or bodies ever were found.Aviation Safety Network Aircraft Accident Douglas R6D-1 (DC-6) 131588 Land‚Äôs End, UKGrossnick, p. 241. This work claims the accident date was 11 October 1956. Bunker Hill (Grissom) Air Force Base operations In May 1959, the 305th Bomb Wing (with B-47s) was reassigned to Bunker Hill Air Force Base, Indiana and assumed responsibility for operating the base. Later that same year, the first Boeing KC-135A Stratotankers were assigned to the unit, replacing the propeller- driven KC-97s that had difficulties keeping up with the B-47 jet aircraft. The 305th began transferring its Stratojets to other wings as replacement aircraft in early 1960 in a planned equipment change. 305th Bomb Wing (B-58) Hustler aircrew patch Convair B-58 Hustler (AF Ser. No. 59-2442) in 1967 In September 1960, the 305th became the second USAF wing selected to receive the Convair B-58A Hustler with the first aircraft received on 11 May 1961. Two months later, the first TB-58A trainer arrived. Three squadrons (364th, 365th and 366th) were equipped with B-58As, and, the wing was declared operationally ready in August 1962. A wing B-58 set five records on 16 October 1963 by flying from Tokyo, Japan, to London, England (via Alaska and Greenland), in 8:35 hours at an average speed of approximately 938 mph (1,510 km/hr).Knaack, p. 395 In a little-known attempt to increase the flexibility of the B-58 as a weapons system, experiments were carried out in April 1964 under a program known as Operation Bullseye to see if the B-58 could carry and deliver conventional bombs. In coordination with Republic F-105Ds and McDonnell F-4C/Ds, sorties were flown using B-58s as lead ships and pathfinders and as independent strike aircraft. It was demonstrated that the B-58 could carry iron bombs on the wing root bomb racks that had earlier been added to accommodate four Mk. 43 nuclear weapons. Iron bombs of varying weights up to 3.000 pounds were dropped, usually from low altitudes and at speeds of 600 knots. Almost all of the drops were visual, with the AN/ASQ-42 system rarely being used. However, the fear that the B-58's integral wing tanks would make it vulnerable to ground fire during low-altitude delivery lead to the abandonment of the program. The wing operated a B-58 combat crew training school (CCTS), August 1965 ‚Äì December 1969, and gained a Boeing EC-135 Post- Attack Command Control System (PACCS) mission with the 3d PACCS Squadron in mid-1966. After 26 years of bearing the name Bunker Hill, the base was renamed Grissom Air Force Base on 12 May 1968 after Lieutenant Colonel Virgil I. \\"Gus\\" Grissom, USAF, a native of Mitchell, Indiana, who was one of the original seven Mercury astronauts. Having later commanded the Gemini 3 mission in 1965, Lieutenant Colonel Grissom was assigned as commander for the first manned Apollo mission, but was killed with the rest of his crew during a fire in his Apollo 1 capsule during a pre-launch rehearsal on Pad 34 at Cape Kennedy, Florida in January 1967. The active service life of the B-58 was destined to be rather short. Phaseout of the B-58 fleet was ordered by Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara in December 1965, since it was felt that the high- altitude performance of the B-58 could no longer guarantee success against increasingly sophisticated Soviet air defenses, particularly high-altitude surface-to-air missiles such as the SA-2 Guideline. At that time, Secretary McNamara also announced that the F-111 would be built for both the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy. McNamara further proposed that a SAC variant of the new F-111, to be designated FB-111A, along with improvements in the Air Force Minuteman and Navy Polaris missile systems and modernization of the subsonic Boeing B-52, would enhance strategic deterrence and make the B-58 superfluous to the needs of the USAF. The first B-58 to go into long-term storage was B-58A (AF Serial No. 59-2446) which flew to Davis‚ÄìMonthan Air Force Base, Arizona on 5 November 1969. Once underway, the B-58 retirement program moved relatively rapidly. The retirement was completed on 16 January 1970, when the 305th Bomb Wing's last two B-58s (AF Serial No. 55-0662 and 61-078) were flown to Davis-Monthan for storage. =305th Air Refueling Wing= With the loss of its bombardment squadrons, the 305th Bomb Wing was converted to an inflight- refueling wing using KC-135As, and, it was redesignated as the 305th Air Refueling Wing on 1 January 1970. It was assigned to Strategic Air Command, Second Air Force, 42nd Air Division. KC-135 Stratotanker From the early 1970s, the wing supported worldwide tanker task forces by deploying KC-135 aircraft to Europe, Alaska, Greenland, and the Pacific. In 1975, the 3d ACCS was inactivated and its specialized EC-135s were transferred to the 70th Air Refueling Squadron for the Post-Attack Command and Control System mission. Also in 1975, the unit was transferred to the Eighth Air Force. The unit was redesignated as the 305th Air Refueling Wing, Heavy on 1 February 1978. The wing provided tanker-refueling support to units involved in the Invasion of Grenada (October 1983) and the restoration of democracy in Panama (December 1989). From August 1990 to June 1991, the unit deployed personnel and aircraft to provide refueling support for air operations to and in Southwest Asia. During the First Gulf War, aircraft and personnel from the 305th were primarily assigned to the 1703rd and 1709th Provisional Air Refueling Wings at King Khalid Military City (KKMC) and at Royal Saudi Air Force Air Force Base Jeddah, respectively. The 305th Wing also delivered food to the Kurds in Northern Iraq, April‚ÄìMay 1991. The Post-Attack Command and Control System mission was inactivated, and, the EC-135 aircraft were retired in May 1992. The unit was redesignated the 305th Air Refueling Wing on 1 September 1991. =305th Air Mobility Wing= On 1 June 1992, Strategic Air Command (SAC) was inactivated and the 305th realigned to the newly established Air Mobility Command (AMC), merging former SAC air refueling aircraft with strategic and tactical theater airlift aircraft operated by the former Military Airlift Command (MAC), the latter also having been inactivated on the same date. The wing was also redesignated as the 305th Air Mobility Wing (305 AMW) on 1 October 1994. The 1993 Base Realignment and Closure Commission directed realignment of Grissom Air Force Base to the Air Force Reserve and the 305th Air Refueling Wing phased out operations there in 1994. The KC-135R-equipped 70th and 305th Air Refueling Squadrons were inactivated. In addition, the EC-135G/L radio-relay aircraft, as part of the PACCS system, were also retired. The 305th Air Mobility Wing was moved without personnel or equipment to McGuire Air Force Base, New Jersey, replacing the 438th Airlift Wing on 1 October 1994. At McGuire, the wing controls three squadrons of Boeing C-17A Globemaster III transports and Douglas KC-10A Extender air-refueling aircraft. The 305th Air Mobility Wing is currently operational at Joint Base McGuire- Dix-Lakehurst, New Jersey which has more than 55 years of service. It also operates in parallel with its Air Force Reserve Command \\"Associate\\" wing, the 514th Air Mobility Wing (514 AMW), which operates the same KC-10 and C-17 aircraft. The 305th AMW also works with the 108th Wing (108 WG), an Air Mobility Command-gained unit of the New Jersey Air National Guard, operating the KC-135R Stratotanker, also on McGuire AFB. On 3 March 2009, the 305th Air Mobility Wing underwent significant changes due to BRAC 2005. The wing no longer provides installation support for McGuire ‚Äì the 87th Air Base Wing (87th ABW) now provides the installation support. When the two wings divided, the 305th Mission Support Group and 305th Medical Group transferred to the 87th ABW to become the 87th Mission Support Group and 87th Medical Group. The 305th Maintenance Group and 305th Operations Groups continue to provide a responsive, combat-ready mobility and expeditionary capability for United States. However, by virtue of the same BRAC 2005 legislation, the 305th Air Mobility Wing not only controls air operations at McGuire AFB, but also those at Naval Air Engineering Station Lakehurst (with the exception of the Naval Air Warfare Center test strip). In effect, this places the 305th AMW Commander as the single airfield authority at both McGuire AFB and Lakehurst. =Units today= The following squadrons make up the 305th Operations Group (305 OG): *6th Airlift Squadron, flying C-17 Globemaster III cargo aircraft *2d Air Refueling Squadron, flying KC-10 Extender air refueling aircraft *32d Air Refueling Squadron, flying KC-10 Extender air refueling aircraft *305th Operations Support Squadron, supporting flying operations for wing aircrew The following squadrons make up the 305th Maintenance Group (305 MXG): *305th Maintenance Operations Squadron *305th Maintenance Squadron *305th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron *605th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron *305th Aerial Port Squadron Lineage * Constituted as the 305th Bombardment Wing, Medium on 20 December 1950 : Activated on 2 January 1951 : Redesignated 305th Air Refueling Wing on 1 January 1970 : Redesignated 305th Air Refueling Wing, Heavy on 1 February 1978 : Redesignated 305th Air Refueling Wing on 1 September 1991 : Redesignated 305th Air Mobility Wing on 1 October 1994 =Assignments= * Second Air Force, 2 January 1951 * 6th Air Division, 10 February 1951 : Attached to: 7th Air Division, 4 September ‚Äì 5 December 1953 : Attached to: 5th Air Division, 3 November 1955 ‚Äì 8 January 1956 and 7 January ‚Äì 8 March 1957 * Second Air Force, 1 June 1959 * 17th Air Division, 15 July 1959 * 19th Air Division, 1 January 1961 * 825th Strategic Aerospace Division, 1 September 1964 * 42d Air Division, l January 1970 * 40th Air Division, 1 July 1973 * 42d Air Division, 1 December 1982 * Eighth Air Force, 16 June 1988 * Fifteenth Air Force, 1 September 1991 * Twenty-First Air Force, 1 July 1993 * Eighteenth Air Force, 1 October 2003‚Äìpresent =Components= Groups * 305th Bombardment (later, 305th Operations) Group: 2 January 1951 ‚Äì 16 June 1952; 1 September 1991 ‚Äì 15 October 1993; 1 October 1994‚Äìpresent * 458th Operations Group: 1 October 1994 ‚Äì 1 July 1995 Squadrons * 3d Airborne Command and Control Squadron: 1 April 1970 ‚Äì 31 December 1975 * 68th Air Refueling Squadron: 1 June 1959 ‚Äì 25 March 1965 * 70th Air Refueling Squadron: 1 January 1970 ‚Äì 1 September 1991 * 305th Air Refueling Squadron: attached 2 July 1951 ‚Äì 15 June 1952, assigned 16 June 1952 ‚Äì 1 May 1959 (detached 4 January ‚Äì c. 16 April 1955); assigned 25 March 1965 ‚Äì 1 September 1991 * 364th Bombardment Squadron: attached 10 February 1951 ‚Äì 15 June 1952, assigned 16 June 1952 ‚Äì 1 January 1970 * 365th Bombardment Squadron: attached 10 February 1951 ‚Äì 15 June 1952, assigned 16 June 1952 ‚Äì 1 January 1970 * 366th Bombardment Squadron: attached 10 February 1951 ‚Äì 15 June 1952, assigned 16 June 1952 ‚Äì 1 January 1970 * 422d Bombardment Squadron: 1 January ‚Äì l October 1959; 8 March 1960 ‚Äì 15 February 1961. =Bases assigned= * MacDill Air Force Base, Florida, 2 January 1951 ‚Äì 1 June 1959 * Bunker Hill Air Force Base (later Grissom Force Base), Indiana, 1 June 1959 ‚Äì 1 October 1994 * McGuire Air Force Base (part of Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst), New Jersey, 1 October 1994 ‚Äì present =Aircraft operated= * Boeing B-29 Superfortress, 1951‚Äì1953 * Boeing B-50 Superfortress, 1951‚Äì1953 * Boeing KC-97 Stratotanker, 1951‚Äì1959 * Boeing B-47 Stratojet, 1952‚Äì1961, (RB-47, 1958) * Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker, 1959‚Äì1993, (EC-135, 1966‚Äì1992) * Convair B/TB-58A Hustler, 1961‚Äì1970 * Lockheed C-141B Starlifter, 1994‚Äì2004 * McDonnell Douglas KC-10A Extender, 1994‚Äìpresent * Boeing C-17A Globemaster III, 2004‚Äìpresent =Aircraft flying in this unit= KC-10A 79-1710 (Dec15); 79-1949 (Dec15); 84-0188 (Dec15); 85-0034 (Dec15); 86-0036 (Dec15) See also * List of B-29 Superfortress operators * List of B-47 units of the United States Air Force References =Notes= The R6D-1 ‚Äì the U.S. Navy version of the United States Air Force C-118 Liftmaster and the civilian Douglas DC-6B airliner ‚Äì was carrying a crew of nine and 50 passengers on a scheduled Military Air Transport Service flight from RAF Lakenheath, England, to Lajes Field in the Azores on 10 October 1956[1] when it disappeared over the Atlantic Ocean about 590 km (370 miles) southwest of Land‚Äôs End, England, at approximately 22:10.[2][3] All of the passengers were personnel of the U.S. Air Force's 307th Bombardment Wing stationed at Lincoln Air Force Base, Nebraska, returning to the United States from 90 days of temporary duty in England.[4] The disappearance was the second major accident involving a Navy R6D-1 in 19 months, an R6D-1 having crashed in Hawaii in March 1955. =Bibliography= * * (.pdf is introduction only)  0305 Category:Military units and formations established in 1950 Category:Military units and formations in New Jersey ","title":"305th Air Mobility Wing"},{"id":"2438541","text":"Mahar (also known as Maha and Mara) is an Indian community found largely in the state of Maharashtra and neighbouring areas. Most of the Mahar community followed B. R. Ambedkar in converting to Buddhism in the middle of the 20th century. , the Mahar caste was designated as a Scheduled Caste in 16 Indian states. History The origin of the name Mahar is uncertain. These diverse origins suggest that the Mahars are the indigenous inhabitants of Maharashtra, India. The Mahar caste were considered a shudra community by the Hindu castes. However, they were socio-economically well above most other untouchable groups because their traditional role had been important in the village administrative system, had necessitated that they had at least a rudimentary education and frequently brought them into contact with upper-caste Hindus. They lived on the outskirts of villages and their duties included those of village watchman and trackers of thieves, messenger, wall mender, adjudicator of boundary disputes, supplying coarse cloth to the village. In return for these services, the village granted them a watan, or rights to small piece of land, to do their own cultivation. The watan also included share of village produce. They also worked at times as agricultural labourers. =Pre-colonial period= In 14th century, Mahar Bhakti saint Chokhamela, and many of his family members such as Karmamela, Banka, Nirmala, and Soyarabai became popular for their religious poetry called abhang. The Mahar were subjected to degradation during the rule of the Peshwas, who treated them as untouchables. =British India= A Mahar Man winding thread from The Tribes and Castes of the Central Provinces of India (1916) Under British rule, the Mahars became aware of the scope for social and political advancement. Their traditional role had been low-status but important in the village system. In the mid-20th century, the Mahar gave up their traditional jobs to a large extent in rural Maharashtra, and took employment in the urban mills, docks, construction sites and railways. They created a receptive body of urban workers who were ready to join a political movement for higher status and equality. =Mahatma Jyotirao Phule= In 1873, Jyotirao Phule, the founder of Satyashodhak Samajwhich aimed to abolish religious slavery from the influence of Brahaminical scripturesorganised Mahars. Mahars were not allowed to enter Hindu temples and were considered unclean. Even their entry into the shrines of Hindu gods was restricted. Their first conference was held in Mumbai in 1903. =Shahu of Kolhapur= Shahu, the ruler of the princely state of Kolhapur, abolished Mahar watan in 1918 and freed the Mahars in his territory from the slavery imposed by the caste Hindu society of the day. He also gave them all the human rights and equality that others enjoy. Military role =Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj= The Mahar served in various armies over several centuries. The Maratha king Shivaji recruited a number of them into his army in the 17th century. They served as guards in hill forts and as soldiers. =British Rule= During the colonial period, large numbers of Mahars were recruited for military duties by the East India Company and the British Raj. The Battle of Koregaon (1 January 1818) is commemorated by an obelisk known as the Koregaon pillarwhich was erected at the site of the battleand by a medal issued in 1851. The pillar featured on the Mahar Regiment crest until the Independence of India; it is inscribed with the names of 22 Mahars killed at the battle. The Mahar were initially heavily recruited into the East India company military units, but this process slowed after the Indian Rebellion of 1857. Their recruitment was halted under Lord Kitchener in the early 1890s. Before the rebellion, Mahar regiments made up one-sixth of the Bombay units of the East India Company but thereafter they were pensioned off and gradually removed from military service. Mahar recruitment reached its nadir in the early 1890s (sources differ as to exact year) when Kitchener halted the recruitment of Untouchables in Maharashtra in favour of \\"martial races,\\" such as the Marathas and other north-western communities. The Mahar community attempted to confront this block with a petition circulated among the Mahar, Chamar, and Mang former soldiersall Marathi-speaking Untouchablesbut the movement was unable to organise and submit their petition. The attempt at a challenge had been spearheaded by Gopal Baba Walangkar, himself a Mahar and former soldier, but he found that Mahar military pensioners were unwilling to sign because they feared that they might lose their pensions. A Mahar regiment was created during World War I but only for a few years and because of British desperation for additional troops. In 1941, the Mahar Regiment proper was created.Mahars Turn Sixty. Mod.nic.in (1 October 1941). Retrieved on 2012-03-28. Demographics In 1969, the Mahars constituted about 70% of the total Scheduled Caste population and also represented about 9% of population of the state of Maharashtra. , the Mahar community was designated as a Scheduled Caste (SC) in 16 Indian states, being: Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh Assam, Chhattisgarh, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Daman and Diu, Goa, Gujarat, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Telangana and West Bengal. Religion Mahar is numerically the largest Scheduled Caste in Maharashtra, according to the 2001 Census of India. =Christianity= In the late 19th century, Otto Weishaupt's attempts to evangelise in the Sangamner area of Ahmadnagar district met with little success with communities such as the Brahmins, Muslims and Bhils but his efforts to promote Christianity did appeal to the Mahars there. There were also some Mahar converts to Christianity in other areas of Ahmednagar district around the early 20th century. =Buddhism= The Christian conversion movement became overshadowed by the emergence of B. R. Ambedkar's Buddhist equivalent. When he converted to Buddhism at Nagpur in 1956, many Mahars were among those of his followers who chose to do the same. As Buddhists, they gave up their traditional Hindu occupations and sought to redefine their social status. Ambedkar died about two months after this mass conversion. At the same spot, after his cremation, more Mahars were converted to Buddhism. Now, this community is the third most populous in Mumbai. Some Buddhist leaders among the population prefer that the term Mahar no longer be applied to these converts. Buddhism appealed to the sense of equality for the Mahars; an intellectual of Mahar origin said, \\"I have accepted Buddhist doctrine. I am Buddhist now. I am not Mahar now, not untouchable nor even Hindu. I have become a human being\\". Contributions to culture and arts According to Eleanor Zelliot, Dalit literature originated in Marathi-speaking areas of Maharashtra. She credits Ambedkar, a Mahar himself, for inspiring many Dalit writers. Baburao Bagul (1930‚Äì2008), Shankarrao Kharat, and Bandhu Madhav were early Marathi writers from the Mahar community. The Mahar writer Namdeo Dhasal (who founded Dalit Panther) was significant in the Dalit movement. Other notable Mahar authors writing in Marathi include Shantabai Kamble, Raja Dhale, Daya Pawar, and Narendra Jadhav.

Early life  Born Robert Chester Ruark, Jr., to Charlotte A. Ruark and Robert C. Ruark, a bookkeeper for a wholesale grocery, young Ruark grew up in Wilmington, North Carolina. His brother, David, was adopted, and little is known about him. The Ruark family was deeply affected by the Depression, but still managed to send Robert to college. He graduated early from New Hanover High School, and enrolled in the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill at age 15. His studies included a few journalism classes but, contrary to popular belief, he did not earn a degree in journalism.  Early career  In the 1930s, Ruark was fired from an accounting job in the Works Progress Administration, and did a hitch in the United States Merchant Marine. He worked for two small town newspapers in North Carolina: the Hamlet News Messenger and, later, the Sanford Herald. In 1936, Ruark moved to Washington, D.C., and was hired as a copy boy for The Washington Daily News, a Scripps- Howard newspaper. In just a few months he was the paper's top sports reporter. During World War II, Ruark was commissioned an ensign in the United States Navy, and served ten months as a gunnery officer on Atlantic and Mediterranean convoys.  Marriage  In 1938, Ruark married Virginia Webb, an interior designer from an upper-middle-class family in the Washington, D.C., area, and a graduate of Georgetown University. They divorced in 1963, and had no children. Virginia Webb-Ruark died in 1966.  Writing career  Upon his return to Washington, Ruark joined the Scripps-Howard Newspaper Alliance. As his obituary in The New York Times stated, Ruark was \\"sometimes glad, sometimes sad, and often mad ‚Äî but almost always provocative.\\" Some of his columns were eventually collected into two books, I Didn't Know It Was Loaded (1948) and One for the Road (1949). As he became recognized, Ruark began to write fiction, first for literary magazines, and then his first novel, Grenadine Etching, in 1947. The novel parodied the popular historical romances of the time and set the stage for his many humorous novels and articles published in the Saturday Evening Post, Esquire, and other popular publications.  African safari  After enjoying some success as a writer, Ruark decided that it was time to fulfill a lifelong dream to go on safari to Africa, fueled by his doctor's advice to have a year's rest.p. 268 Powell, William S. Dictionary of North Carolina Biography, Volume 5 1994 UNC Press Legendary Ker and Downey Safaris booked him with Harry Selby, and Ruark began a love affair with Africa. Ruark was booked with Selby because of a desire to use a tracker named Kidogo, who had once hunted with Ernest Hemingway. Ruark's pairing with Selby, though fortuitous, was pure chance. Kidogo was a member of Selby's crew. As a result of this first safari, Ruark wrote a book called Horn of the Hunter, in which he detailed his hunt. Selby became an overnight legend and was subsequently booked for up to five years in advance by Americans wishing to duplicate Ruark's adventures. After the first safari, Selby and Ruark again went hunting, and this time they took cameras along. The result was a one-hour documentary entitled Africa Adventure, released by RKO pictures. Though extremely difficult to find, a 16mm print of this movie was discovered in 2002, and a DVD copy was created and donated to the Robert Ruark Foundation in Southport, North Carolina. In 1953, Ruark began writing a series for Field & Stream magazine entitled The Old Man and the Boy. Considered largely autobiographical (although technically fiction), this heartwarming series ran until late 1961. The stories were characterized by the philosophical musings of the Old Man, who was modeled after both of Ruark's grandfathers, but mostly on Captain Edward \\"Ned\\" Hall Adkins, Ruark's maternal grandfather. In the stories, young Bob Ruark grows up hunting and fishing in coastal North Carolina, always guided by the Old Man. However, the pain of his parents' difficult domestic life and his relatively few childhood friends (Ruark, something of a child prodigy in school, was a loner) are tellingly absent from the narratives. Many of the stories were collected into a book of the same name, followed shortly thereafter by a companion book entitled The Old Man's Boy Grows Older. Today these two books are probably his best remembered works. Twenty stories were also published in the book Robert Ruark's Africa.http://www.fieldandstream.com/blogs/finding-elk-bears-and- other-big-game/2010/02/petzal-robert-ruark%E2%80%99s-africa Ruark's first bestselling novel was published in 1955. Entitled Something of Value, it describes the Mau Mau Uprising by Kenyan rebels against British rule. The novel drew from the author's personal knowledge and experiences on safari in Africa, and was adapted into a successful 1957 film, Something of Value. Uhuru, a novel with a similar theme, but not intended to be a sequel, was published in 1962. \\"Uhuru\\" is the Swahili word for freedom. He had intended to write a final chapter in the series with the working title of A Long View From a Tall Hill, but this never materialized. Last years After his first half dozen books or so, Ruark continued to write, though few of his later novels matched his earlier successes. In 1960, after a bittersweet visit to his hometown of Wilmington, North Carolina, Ruark left the U.S. for good. He lived in London and Barcelona, before settling in Sant Antoni de Calonge in Catalunya, Spain. Shortly before his death, he wrote a final article which later appeared in Playboy and was titled \\"Nothing Works and Nobody Cares.\\" He died in London, England, on July 1, 1965, of cirrhosis of the liver brought on by alcoholism. His last novel, The Honey Badger, exemplified the condition of the author at this time in his life. The book was published posthumously, as was Use Enough Gun, which is essentially a collection of excerpts from his earlier works. More notable are the two collections published by McIntosh and Casada, which are representative of the author's finest work. Robert Ruark is buried in Palam√≥s in the Province of Girona in Catalunya, Spain.

History and profile Birds & Blooms was started in 1995. The magazine has its editorial offices in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The magazine is produced once every two months. Most of the articles and photographs in the magazine are reader-submitted, giving the magazine a non-scientific approach. It contains information on how to attract birds and other wildlife to the backyard and other information of interest to outdoor enthusiasts and amateur ornithologists and lepidopterists. The magazine targets audiences from two hobby demographics: gardening and birdwatching. In 2008, 70% of American adults were involved in gardening, and 6.4% were bird-watchers. In May 2005, Birds & Blooms began publishing Birds & Blooms EXTRA with magazine issues published six months a year on alternating months to the original Birds & Bloom magazine.

In 1999, the Anaheim Angels hired Stoneman as general manager. He served in that role until 2007, and continued with the Angels as a consultant after stepping down. He was named the interim general manager of the Angels on July 1, 2015, following the resignation of Jerry Dipoto. College A 1962 graduate of West Covina High School in southern California, Stoneman spent a year at Mt. San Antonio College in Walnut, then transferred north to the University of Idaho in Moscow to play for Wayne Anderson, and helped the Vandals win the inaugural Big Sky title in 1964 as a sophomore. When Stoneman was a junior, the Vandals were 17-13 and he was 5-3 with a 1.80 ERA and averaged 1.5 strikeouts per inning. As a senior in 1966, Stoneman was 6‚Äì2 with a 0.45 ERA in the regular season, and the Vandals won the Big Sky again with a record in the regular season. Invited to the NCAA playoffs for the first time, Idaho eliminated Colorado State College (now Northern Colorado) and Air Force on the road in Greeley, Colorado.Tri-City Herald ‚Äì Arizonans next on Idaho list in bid for nationals ‚Äì 1966-06-02 ‚Äì p.19 The Vandals were one step from the College World Series in Omaha, but lost to Arizona in Tucson in the District 7 finals, today's \\"Super-Regionals\\" (Sweet 16). Idaho ended their best-ever season at Stoneman received his bachelor's degree from the University of Idaho in 1966, and a master's degree from the University of Oklahoma. While at Idaho, he was an active member of Beta Theta Pi fraternity. Stoneman was selected by the Chicago Cubs in the 31st round of the 1966 Major League Baseball draft, the 595th overall selection. Playing career After college and the baseball draft, Stoneman pitched in the Rookie League in Caldwell, Single A in Lodi, and Double-A in Dallas in 1966. He started out the 1967 season in Double-A and moved to Triple-A in Tacoma. Stoneman was called up to the major leagues in mid-season, where he appeared in 28 games as a reliever for the Chicago Cubs, with a 3.29 ERA and 52 strikeouts in 63 innings. In the expansion draft of October 1968, Stoneman was selected by the Montreal Expos, where he spent five seasons and became a starter for manager Gene Mauch. He threw his two no-hitters with the Expos: the first against the Philadelphia Phillies at Connie Mack Stadium on April 17, 1969. It was Stoneman's fifth major league start and only the ninth game of the franchise's existence; he had eight strikeouts and five walks. The second came at the end of the 1972 season on October 2; beating the New York Mets in Montreal at Jarry Park, caught by Tim McCarver. The latter was the first major league no-hitter in Canada, and both were 7‚Äì0 scores. The second included nine strikeouts (and seven walks). Stoneman also threw a one-hitter at home in 1971 against the San Diego Padres, a well-attended 2‚Äì0 win on Helmet Night on Wednesday, June 16. In perhaps the best outing of his career, Stoneman struck out 14 and allowed just one base on balls. The only hit came with one out in the seventh inning, a clean single to right field off the bat of Cito Gaston, which was the Padres' only well-struck ball of the night. He was named to the National League All-Star Team in 1972 and pitched two innings in relief with two strikeouts. Standing and , Stoneman was a workhorse who over four consecutive seasons (1969‚Äì72) logged more than 200 innings pitched. He struck out 251 in 295 innings in 1971, with a 17‚Äì16 record and a 3.15 ERA for non-contending Montreal, 71‚Äì90 (). Stoneman was third in strikeouts in the National League in 1971, behind Tom Seaver (289) and Ferguson Jenkins (263), and his 39 starts tied for the league-high with Jenkins. He also had 20 complete games in 1971, tied for third with Bob Gibson. His career was shortened by an arm injury in 1973: his earned run average ballooned from 2.98 in 1972 to 6.80 (1973), then 6.10 (1974), for a record of only 5‚Äì16 in that span. Overall, Stoneman won 54 games and lost 85 (), with an ERA of 4.08 in 245 appearances. For his career he had 169 starts, 45 complete games, and 934 strikeouts in 1,236.1 innings. As a batter, Stoneman holds the record with most consecutive games played with at least one strikeout. From April 30, 1971, to April 21, 1972, Stoneman played in 37 consecutive games with at least one strikeout in an at bat. He was left in to bat in the 1972 All-Star Game against Gaylord Perry, where, he struck out in the bottom of the seventh inning. In 338 regular season at bats, Stoneman struck out 212 times and compiled a career batting average of .086 with 25 singles, 4 extra-base hits (all doubles), and 23 walks. Despite that strikeout streak, his best season batting average was .129 in 1971. The strikeout streak record was tied by New York Yankees outfielder Aaron Judge in 2017. Front office career After his playing career ended, Stoneman worked in banking in Canada, then joined the Montreal Expos front office in November 1983, starting out in player relations. He became the team's vice president of business operations in September 1984, and later served as the club's general manager. Stoneman became general manager of the Angels after the season. He hired Mike Scioscia as the club's manager and presided over its American League title and World Series championship and the team's ownership transition from the Walt Disney Company to Arturo Moreno. Stoneman stepped down as GM following the 2007 season. On July 1, 2015, Angels general manager Jerry DiPoto resigned following a power struggle with manager Mike Scioscia. Stoneman was brought in as interim GM while the team looked for a full-time replacement. Billy Eppler was hired as the full-time replacement on October 4, 2015.

It is served by two trains a week, one in each direction on Saturday mornings. With 30 passenger entries and exits between April 2011 and March 2012, Denton was the third-least used station in Great Britain. By 2015‚Äì16, the estimate of station usage had changed little, with 37 passenger journeys recorded for an entire year on the weekly train to Stalybridge. In 2018/19, Denton was deemed the least used station in Great Britain, tied with Stanlow & Thornton. Reddish South station, also in Greater Manchester and one stop south of the station, was ranked the third least used with just 60 entries and exits. The orientation of the line, running south- west to north-east, is a clue to the origin of Denton Station; it stands on the former mainline of the London & North Western Railway between Crewe and Leeds via Stockport. The London & North Western Railway had already completed its line to Manchester via Stockport and now looked to expand to reach the woollen districts of the West Riding of Yorkshire, building quadruple tracks all the way to Huddersfield and Leeds via the Standedge tunnel. History A 1912 Railway Clearing House Junction Diagram showing railways in the vicinity of Denton (bottom left) The line between Guide Bridge and Heaton Norris Junction (north of ) was surveyed by the Manchester and Birmingham Railway in 1845 (shortly before it became part of the London and North Western Railway), and opened in 1849. A new station was opened by the LNWR in 1888 and the route was quadrupled in 1889. Before the Railways Act 1921, it was served by trains from Stockport to Ashton, Oldham, Rochdale and Stalybridge. A very limited passenger service ran to Manchester. Stalybridge could also be reached via and the Stalybridge Junction Railway. This route was opened in 1882 by the LNWR to avoid the congested junction at Guide Bridge, but closed to passengers in 1950. The older route via Guide Bridge remained a useful link between the northern and southern Manchester rail networks and this ensured its continued use by British Rail until the late 1980s ‚Äì before May 1989, an hourly service ran on weekdays along the route. The re-routing of the Leeds‚ÄìHuddersfield‚ÄìManchester express service to Manchester Piccadilly at the May 1989 timetable change made the service essentially redundant though, as travellers could then access south Manchester services directly at Piccadilly, and its frequency was substantially cut: by 1992, it had been reduced to just a single weekly train (the statutory minimum level necessary to avoid the requirement for formal closure proceedings). North of the station is Denton Junction where the line divides, with the mainline going to Guide Bridge and the little-used branch to Ashton Moss. The latter route is normally used only by freight and empty stock transfer workings but is used also for diversions if the main line between Stockport and Manchester Piccadilly is closed for engineering work. A further line to Droylsden diverged from this ( further on at Ashton Moss Junction), which at one time was used by direct trains from the East Lancashire Line to London Euston. That line was closed in 1969 and subsequently lifted. The station is a request stop, having two platforms in an island layout. In theory, prospective passengers must flag down the train as it approaches the station. However, in practice the train usually stops at every station on the line even if no passenger is waiting. In January 2020 the station was named as the joint-quietest in the UK (alongside Stanlow & Thornton Station in Cheshire), with just 46 entries and exits in the period 1st April 2018 to 31st March 2019. Closure proposal An excursion from Preston to Buxton hauled by West Coast Rail Class 57 57313 at the Stockport- bound platform in September 2016 Network Rail, in their Route Utilisation Strategy (RUS) for the North West, were proposing closure of Reddish South and Denton stations and withdrawal of the remaining passenger service. The line itself would remain open for freight and diverted passenger workings. However, an open-access operator called Grand Central had proposed using the line for services between London Euston and Bradford Interchange via the West Coast Main Line, using Guide Bridge station as a stop. That proposal has since been dropped. The promotion of a passenger service through Denton Station seems uncertain, whilst the future of freight traffic seems more assured as evidenced by the North West Rail Utilisation Strategy May 2007 of Network Rail. A more frequent service was considered for the 2008 timetable shakeup, which was designed to implement major changes to service patterns on the West Coast Main Line; however, because of the track layout and congestion at Heaton Norris, operational analysis suggests \\"Timetabling the move across Heaton Norris is very likely to be problematic. Performance could be impacted by the crossing move at Heaton Norris Junction. If there are two passenger trains an hour on this line, it will be more difficult to hold freight trains on the Denton line, additionally affecting performance.\\"RUS , p.61, para 5.3.2. Stockport corridor Option 1: Stockport ‚Äì Victoria service \\"[Reddish South and] Denton receives a minimal (once a week) service because anticipated demand has not justified increasing it. The operating cost of providing a service at this station exceeds the revenue and socio-economic benefit they generate, even before periodic renewal costs are considered.\\"RUS , p.65, para 5.3.2. Stockport corridor Option 8: Close [Reddish South and] Denton Station It further goes on to say that for passenger effects \\"The stations are both served by one train a week on a Saturday, in one direction only. A full impact analysis would be required prior to formal closure procedures, but it is reasonable to assume that any journey that could be made using this service could equally well be made by another mode. Data collection including observation on a representative Saturday has been unable to record any use of these stations. Consultation respondents cautioned against this option whilst uncertainty remains about local regeneration.\\" There is, however, an issue with this statement that the one-train-a-week service is on a Friday and not a Saturday, so it is most unlikely any passenger activity will be recorded. The future of freight using the line through Denton seems to be more assured. It is proposed to improve gauge clearance to allow intermodal trains to/from Trafford Park to divert via Denton. A lack of a diversionary route for some freight trains to/from Trafford Park causes poor performance when there is disruption on the primary route. It also means that this traffic cannot run when there is a planned closure of the route. It is proposed to carry out this work provided it can be done at little or no extra cost through renewal works.RUS , p. 73, para 5.3.3. Marple corridor Option 3: East Manchester Gauge In the 2012 North West Route Utilisation Strategy Final Recommendations it was reported that provision of W9 and W10 gauge clearance that will allow intermodal trains to/from Trafford Park to divert via Denton, thus improving performance when the primary route is disrupted or closed (when traffic can not run) had been implemented.RUS p. 2, ID:18 North West RUS 5.3.3 Marple corridor option 3: East Manchester Gauge There were no remarks concerning RUS 5.3.2, the Stockport corridor.  Services  In the 20 May 2018 timetable changes, Northern introduced a return service at the station and changed the day of operation to Saturday. The first service departs at 08:56 to and returns at 09:56 to on Saturdays only.2J44 0846 Stalybridge to Stockport, 21 July 2018 Realtime Trains , retrieved 16 July 20182J45 0945 Stockport to Stalybridge, 21 July 2018 Realtime Trains , retrieved 16 July 2018 This was the first time in over twenty years that the station has had a service in both directions.

The awards are generally considered to be the highest national honors in their field, and are unofficially known as the \\"Pulitzer Prizes of student journalism\\". The National Scholastic Press Association administers the contest for high school programs, while the Associated Collegiate Press administers the college and university contests. Pacemakers are awarded annually at the JEA/NSPA National Conference (for high schools) and the ACP/CMA National College Media Convention (for colleges) in the following categories: Newspaper, Online, Yearbook/Magazine, and Broadcast. Newspaper Pacemakers ACP, NSPA and the Newspaper Association of America Foundation have co-sponsored the Pacemaker competition since 1961. NSPA began the awards in 1927. The Pacemaker competition was discontinued in 1948‚Äì49, then resumed in 1961. The awards, which are considered by many to be the highest national honors for student journalism, are unique in their judging. Several issues from each newspaper's production schedule are randomly selected to be judged, which ensures that to be competitive for a Pacemaker, a publication must show consistent quality over an entire academic year. Judges select Pacemaker Finalists and Pacemakers based on the following: coverage and content, quality of writing and reporting, leadership on the opinion page, evidence of in-depth reporting, design, photography, art and graphics. Pacemakers are selected by the staff of a professional newspaper in the host city of the annual National College Media Convention, in the case of college papers, or the National High School Journalism Convention for high school publications. There are multiple awards in each category every year: in 2006, there were 26 high school winners.NSPA ‚Äì Contest Winners Online Pacemakers This contest replaces the NSPA/ACP Best of the Net competition, which began in 1996. Member publication Web sites are not automatically entered in the Pacemaker competition; staffs must submit a Pacemaker entry form. Online Pacemaker entries are judged during the months of February and March, based upon the following criteria: design, navigation, writing/editing, graphics and interactivity.NSPA ‚Äì Contests Yearbook/Magazine Pacemakers Yearbook/Magazine Pacemakers are judged based upon the following criteria: writing/editing, design, content, concept, photography, art and graphics. In conjunction with the Yearbook Pacemaker competition, ACP/NSPA will recognize with an award of excellence the best interactive (CD/DVD) yearbooks in a separate contest. Interactive entries must include a copy of the printed book. Broadcast Pacemakers The NSPA awards Broadcast Pacemaker awards for student-produced television news programs at high schools. An entry consists of a student-produced news program or segment of a longer news program, on VHS format video tape. For the purposes of this competition, student-produced means that the majority of the planning, writing, scripting, taping and editing of the program was done by students. This contest is unique to the high school level, as no similar award is offered by the ACP to college broadcast programs.

She was the lead ship of the , which included one other vessel, , both of which were built in Germany in the early 1880s. Delivery of the two ironclads was delayed by the Sino-French War of 1884‚Äì1885. The ships were armed with a main battery of four guns in a pair of gun turrets, making them the most powerful warships in East Asian waters at the time. Dingyuan served as the flagship of Admiral Ding Ruchang during her active career. In the 1880s and early 1890s, the Beiyang Fleet conducted a routine of training exercises and cruises abroad, with emphasis placed on visits to Japan to intimidate the country. The latter resulted in the Nagasaki Incident in 1886 and contributed to a rise in hostility between the two countries that culminated in the First Sino-Japanese War in 1894. She led the Chinese fleet during the Battle of the Yalu River on 17 September, where the Japanese Combined Fleet sank much of the Beiyang Fleet, though both Dingyuan and Zhenyuan survived despite numerous hits, thanks to their heavy armor. The survivors then retreated to Port Arthur for repairs, but after that city was threatened by the Japanese Army, fled to Weihaiwei. As the Japanese continued to advance, they laid siege to Weihaiwei in late January 1895. On 5 February, a Japanese torpedo boat slipped into the port and hit Dingyuan with a torpedo, inflicting serious damage. The Chinese crew were forced to beach the vessel to avoid sinking, and for the next week, Dingyuan was used as a stationary artillery battery. Japanese ground forces seized the city's coastal fortifications on 9 February, allowing their artillery to shell the ships in the harbor, which prompted Ding to surrender. Dingyuan was scuttled in the harbor on 10 February. A full-scale replica of the ship was built in Weihai in 2003 as a museum ship and in 2019, the Chinese government announced that an underwater survey had located the original vessel's wreck. Design An overview of the layout of a Dingyuan-class ironclad Following the direct intervention of the imperialist European powers in the mid-19th century, including the First and Second Opium Wars, where their superior steam-powered fleets overwhelmed the small Imperial Chinese Navy that still relied on traditional junks, the Chinese began a naval construction program in the 1880s to meet these threats more effectively. They enlisted British and German assistance, and two s were ordered from Germany. Dingyuan was long overall, with a beam of and a draft of . She displaced normally and up to at full load. She was powered by a pair of compound steam engines that each drove a screw propeller. Steam was provided by eight coal- burning fire-tube boilers that were ducted into a pair of funnels amidships. She was capable of a top speed of from . Her crew consisted of 350 officers and enlisted men. The ship carried a main battery of four 20-caliber breech- loading guns in two twin-gun turrets that were placed en echelon forward. These were supported by a secondary battery of two guns in a pair of single turrets, one at the bow and the other at the stern. For defense against torpedo boats, she carried a pair of Hotchkiss revolver cannon and eight Maxim-Nordenfelt quick-firing guns in casemates. Dingyuan was also equipped with three or torpedo tubes. She was protected by compound armor that was 14 in for the armor belt, which covered the central part of the ship were the ammunition magazines and propulsion machinery spaces were located. An armor deck that was thick provided horizontal protection. Her conning tower was covered with of armor plate on the sides. The barbettes for the gun turrets were 12‚Äì14 in thick. A strake of armor that was 8 in thick protected the casemate guns. Service record =Early career= Zhenyuan and Dingyuan in Germany before departing for China Dingyuan was ordered in 1880 and was laid down at the AG Vulcan shipyard in Stettin, Germany in March 1881; her name means \\"eternal peace\\" in Chinese. Work proceeded quickly and she was launched on 28 December 1881 to clear the slipway so work could begin on her sister ship . Fitting-out work continued into May 1883, when the vessel was completed, but delivery was to be delayed until Zhenyuan was finished in April 1884. The start of the outbreak of the Sino-French War in August prevented both Dingyuan-class ships from being delivered until 1885, since Germany would not transfer the vessels to a country at war. Both vessels were manned by German crews, sailing on 3 July 1885 under the German flag in company with the also German-built protected cruiser . The three ships arrived in Tianjin in November, where they were transferred to Chinese control. Li Hongzhang, the Viceroy of Zhili and director of China's naval construction program, inspected the vessels following their arrival. The two ironclads were then commissioned into the Beiyang Fleet, which was based in Port Arthur. The ships steamed south to Shanghai for the winter of 1885‚Äì1886. In the 1880s, the Beiyang Fleet was occupied with an annual routine of winter training cruises to the South China Sea, often in company with the Nanyang Fleet. This cruise typically involved visits to Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong provinces, and sometimes went as far south as stops in Southeast Asia. The rest of the year was spent in northern waters off Zhili, Shandong, and Fengtian provinces, conducting training exercises. Training cruises to foreign ports were conducted in the mid-1880s and early 1890s, both to train navigational skills on voyages far from shore and to show the flag. Discipline aboard the ships of the Beiyang Fleet was poor, which contributed to a low state of readiness of the ships. During this period, the fleet was commanded by Admiral Ding Ruchang, who employed Dingyuan as his flagship. At the time, China lacked dry docks large enough to handle Zhenyuan and Dingyuan, forcing the navy to rely on shipyards in Japan or in British Hong Kong for periodic maintenance. The two Dingyuan- class ships began their training routine in April 1886 in joint maneuvers with the units of the Nanyang Fleet, which culminated in a naval review in Port Arthur. They received the British vessels of the China Station from 19 to 20 May. Dingyuan, Zhenyuan, and four cruisers made the first of their overseas cruises in August 1886, which included stops in British Hong Kong, Busan and Wonsan in Korea, Vladivostok, Russia, and Nagasaki, Japan. While at the latter port in August, Chinese crewmen became involved in an altercation with Japanese locals that resulted in the deaths of eight Chinese sailors and two Japanese police, with forty-two Chinese and twenty-nine Japanese injured. The so-called Nagasaki Incident was characterized by the Japanese press as an attempt by China to intimidate Japan, leading to calls for naval expansion to counter the Beiyang Fleet. The Japanese government ordered three protected cruisers in response. The Japanese also refused to allow the Chinese ironclads to return for repairs in their shipyards, hampering the ability of the Beiyang Fleet to keep the vessels operational. Dingyuan side view The year 1887 passed less eventfully, with the ships spending the bulk of the year in the Bohai Sea. Late in the year, another group of four European-built cruisers arrived, further strengthening the fleet and necessitating extensive maneuvers in 1888 to familiarize the crews with the rest of the fleet. The Beiyang Fleet adopted the same black, white, and buff paint scheme used by the Royal Navy at the time, repainting their vessels at some point in 1888. In 1889, the fleet was divided into two divisions; Dingyuan and several cruisers were sent on a tour of Korean ports while Zhenyuan and the rest of the fleet remained in the Bohai Sea for exercises. The two divisions rendezvoused in Shanghai in December, thereafter proceeding to Hong Kong for Zhenyuan and Dingyuan to be drydocked. They then cruised off Korea. Another visit to Japan came in June and July 1891; the fleet stopped in Kobe on 30 June and Yokohama on 14 July. At the latter port, a large Japanese delegation of senior military commanders and members of the imperial family received the ships. Another voyage to Japan took place the following year. Coupled with the Nagasaki Incident, these voyages contributed to the growing tensions between China and Japan, since Hongzhang intended them to make clear Chinese naval strength at a time the Japanese fleet was small and poorly developed. At the core of the dispute was control over Korea, which since the Convention of Tientsin of 1884, was treated as a co-protectorate of China and Japan. =First Sino-Japanese War= In early 1894, the Donghak Peasant Revolution broke out in Korea, prompting China to send an expedition of 28,000 to suppress the rebels. Japan viewed this as a violation of the Tientsin Convention and deployed 8,000 troops in response, leading to the outbreak of the First Sino-Japanese War on 1 August. The Chinese fleet was no match for the new Combined Fleet of Japan, as years of insufficient naval budgets had not allowed Hongzhang to update the vessels‚Äîfunds he had planned to use to add new quick-firing guns to Zhenyuan and Dingyuan were instead appropriated for the 60th birthday of the Dowager Empress Cixi‚Äîand the Chinese lacked effective commanders and sufficiently trained crews. And to add to China's disadvantages during the war, the Japanese had broken the Chinese diplomatic codes in 1888, giving them access to China's internal communications. As the Chinese made preparations in August for action, they removed the gun shields from the main battery turrets. Experience at the Battle of Pungdo had revealed the thin shields created numerous splinters when struck by enemy fire, and these fragments had inflicted numerous casualties to the gun crews of the cruiser Jiyuan at Pungdo. The crews also placed bags of coal around the gun batteries as a form of improvised armor. The ships were repainted light gray to make them more difficult to observe at sea. The ships of the Beiyang Fleet then steamed to Taku to take on supplies, thereafter doing little for the next month.  Battle of the Yalu River  Sketch of Dingyuan (center) and Zhenyuan (right) under fire at the Yalu River Ding took the fleet on a sweep into the Korea Bay on 12 September to clear the way for a convoy of troopships scheduled to deliver reinforcements to Korea. While on the way to the bay, he received faulty reports indicating the presence of Japanese warships off the Shandong Peninsula, prompting him to change course to search for them. Finding no enemy vessels, he took the fleet to Weihaiwei (now Weihai), and on 15 September, the fleet rendezvoused with the convoy to cover its approach to the mouth of the Yalu River, where the transports deposited the men and supplies on 16 September. During the unloading process, Dingyuan and the bulk of the fleet remained underway to provide distant support and avoid presenting themselves as stationary targets to Japanese torpedo boats known to be in the area. While the Chinese were on the way back to Port Arthur, the Combined Fleet under Vice Admiral It≈ç Sukeyuki intercepted them on 17 September, leading to the Battle of the Yalu River. The poorly-trained Beiyang Fleet sailed in a disorganized line abreast formation, while the Japanese approached them from the south in line ahead; the Chinese ships steamed at around and the Japanese at . It≈ç turned his ships to pass in front of the oncoming Beiyang Fleet. Dingyuan opened fire first, at about 12:20, at the extreme range of , far in excess of what fire-control equipment was capable of accurately directing at the time. The blast effect from Dingyuans initial salvo destroyed her own bridge, collapsing it and trapping Ding and his staff for the duration of the action, depriving the Beiyang Fleet of central control. The rest of the Chinese fleet quickly followed Dingyuan, but failed to score any hits as their opponents passed in front. The Japanese ships returned fire at 12:25, having divided into two squadrons and turned back to starboard to encircle the Chinese. Concentrating their fire on the cruisers on the Chinese right flank, they quickly destroyed the Chinese cruisers and . The battle quickly devolved into a melee at close range, and the Chinese cruisers and were sunk. In return, the Chinese warships inflicted serious damage on the old ironclad , which had been unable to keep pace with the rest of It≈ç's fleet, and was eventually forced to disengage and flee. Zhenyuan and Dingyuan hit the auxiliary cruiser Saiky≈ç Maru with four 12-inch shells and inflicted significant damage. The Japanese ships then concentrated their fire on Dingyuan and Zhenyuan. The ships' heavy citadel armor proved to be impervious to the Japanese shellfire directed against it, though the large-caliber Canet guns mounted on the Matsushima- class cruisers proved to be nearly useless and the other Japanese cruisers were engaged with their Chinese counterparts. Both ships were hit numerous times and several fires broke out, but both crews adeptly suppressed them despite being under heavy fire. By around 17:00, both sides were low on ammunition and the Chinese began to reform their surviving vessels into line- ahead formation. The Japanese eventually broke off at around 17:30 and withdrew. The battered Beiyang Fleet, by then reduced to the two Dingyuan- class ships and four smaller vessels, limped back to Port Arthur, arriving there the next day. Battle of Weihaiwei Dingyuan after the battle, showing extensive damage amidships Repairs to the damaged ships began immediately, and fresh supplies and ammunition were sent to ready the vessels for action. By October, the Japanese Army had begun to approach Port Arthur, forcing the Chinese to withdraw the Beiyang Fleet to Weihaiwei. Ding sortied on 20 October and crossed the Bohai Strait to Weihaiwei without encountering Japanese forces. In early November, Ding sortied to cover the transfer of Zhenyuan, which had remained in Port Arthur as long as possible to complete repairs. The Japanese Army had advanced to Weihaiwei by the end of January 1895, launching a major attack on the port on the 30th to begin the Battle of Weihaiwei. They quickly captured the fortifications on the eastern side of the city despite heavy fire from Dingyuan and other vessels of the fleet. The capture of the fortresses forced the Chinese ships to withdraw to the western portion of the harbor, where they would be out of range for the guns there. Dingyuan disabled one of the disappearing guns in the fortress at Luchiehtsui, but several guns remained on operation, and Japanese gunners quickly set to work to bring them to bear on the trapped fleet. The Chinese ships bombarded Japanese forces as they advanced on the city's defenses. A group of ten Japanese torpedo boats broke into the harbor on the night of 4/5 February and hit Dingyuan with a torpedo on the port side toward the stern. The attack inflicted serious damage and the crew's damage control efforts failed to contain the flooding, hampered by leaking watertight doors. They got steam up in the boilers and began to get underway, but with the uncontrolled flooding threatening to sink the ship, the crew was forced to ground her to prevent her from sinking. The ship was thereafter employed as a stationary artillery battery and Ding shifted his flag to Zhenyuan. Two of the attacking torpedo boats were discovered having been disabled in the previous night's action at dawn. The next night, the torpedo boats made another assault on the Chinese fleet, sinking a cruiser, a training ship, and an auxiliary vessel. By 9 February, the Japanese had seized the fortifications that overlooked the rest of the harbor. They used the position to bombard the crippled Dingyuan with field artillery, further damaging the vessel. With their position in the harbor no longer tenable and most of the vessels damaged‚ÄîZhenyuan had also been badly damaged and was no longer seaworthy‚ÄîDing decided to scuttle Dingyuan the next day and then surrender. The decision provoked many of the senior officers of the Beiyang Fleet to commit suicide, including the ship's commander, Captain Liu Buchan. The exact nature of the crew's efforts to disable the vessel are unclear. Some reports indicate that a mine detonated amidships, and observers aboard the British protected cruiser noted seeing a large explosion aboard Dingyuen. Photographic evidence, which shows the vessel aground in shallow water and with a gaping hole amidships, supports these reports, as does the observations of the British Vice Admiral Edmund Fremantle, who inspected the fleet shortly after the battle. Replica and rediscovery  The replica of ironclad Dingyuan as a museum ship The Chinese government constructed a replica of Dingyuan at Weihai to commemorate both the original vessel and the Beiyang Fleet during the war; the vessel, built on a 1:1 scale, is open as a museum ship. Work on the vessel began in 2003. On 2 September 2019 it was announced that the remains of Dingyuan had been located and over 150 artifacts recovered.

He served as the state's 36th Governor. Early life Samuel A. Baker was born in Patterson, Missouri, an unincorporated community in Wayne County to Samuel Aaron and Mary Amanda (McGhee) Baker His father, a physician and Union Army Civil War veteran, died before young Sam was born.Missouri: The Center State Vol. 3, Walter Barlow Stevens, S.J. Clark Publishing, St. Louis-Chicago, 1915 With the family struggling financially due to his father's death, Sam often had to work and at times attended school in Mill Spring, Missouri only sporadically. Nonetheless, he was determined to better himself in life through higher education. Baker worked as a sawmill assistant and as a railroad section hand until he had saved enough money to attend Southeast Missouri State Teachers College in Cape Girardeau, from which he earned a bachelor's degree in pedagogy. Later, while already working in the education field, Baker would earn a second bachelor's degree from Missouri Wesleyan College.Dictionary of Missouri: Biography, Lawrence O. Christensen, University of Missouri Press, 1999 Educator Sam Baker held a variety of teaching, principal, and superintendent positions around the state in the years following his college graduation. Among the notable were principal at Jefferson City, Missouri in 1899 and Joplin, Missouri. After a three-year term as superintendent for Richmond, Missouri schools, Baker returned to Jefferson City as superintendent in 1913. While there he was instrumental in the issuing of a $100,000 dollar bond passage that brought large improvements to the school district. Voters statewide took notice of his efforts as a reformer and elected Baker as Missouri's Superintendent of Public Schools in 1918. Baker served as the superintendent from 1919 to 1923. During his tenure Baker was successful in securing more funding for rural schools from the state legislature, increasing teacher training and salaries, and promoting more emphasis on vocational education. Despite these improvements Baker was defeated when running for reelection in 1922 as he was edged out by Democrat Charles A. Lee by just a few hundred votes. Governor After his defeat in the 1922 election Sam Baker chose to continue in politics rather than in the education field. Republican incumbent governor Arthur Hyde, limited to one term by Missouri law at the time, endorsed Baker's candidacy to succeed him as governor in 1924. Baker defeated two other Republicans, including Missouri lieutenant governor Hiram Lloyd, in the August primary. In the November general election Baker defeated Democrat Arthur W. Nelson by less than six thousand votes to become Missouri's 36th governor. As governor Baker continued to advocate changes and improvements for Missouri schools, including increased funding and redistricting to consolidate low-quality schools. However, the Missouri legislature, including many members of his own party, foiled Baker's efforts. Several leading Republicans were upset that Baker made political appointments based more on qualifications and friendship regardless of party instead of ones hand-picked by party leadership. Baker did have some areas of success however, including establishment of a Workers' compensation program, passage of a $75 million bond issue to improve the quality of Missouri roads, instituting banking reforms, and the development of Missouri state parks. One of the earliest parks, Sam A. Baker State Park in Wayne county, was named in the governors honor after his death. Death Governor Baker suffered failing health during his final year in office, and shortly after leaving office in January 1929 he suffered two major strokes. Bedridden for his remaining years, Samuel A. Baker died from a cerebral hemorrhage on September 16, 1933. He is buried in Riverview Cemetery in Jefferson City, Missouri.

Lindenthal's work was greatly affected by his pursuit for perfection and his love of art. His structures not only serve the purpose they were designed for, but are aesthetically pleasing to the public eye. Having received little formal education and no degree in civil engineering, Lindenthal based his work on his prior experience and techniques used by other engineers of the time. Early life Lindenthal was born in Br√ºnn, Austrian Empire, now Brno, Czech Republic in 1850. Lindenthal began to receive practical training in 1866 when he was employed as a mason and carpenter. At the age of 18, Lindenthal left his family to set out to make a life of his own in Vienna, Austria. Career Gustav Lindenthal in 1880 The Hell Gate Bridge c. 1917 When he arrived in Vienna he became an assistant in the engineering department for the Empress Elisabeth Railway of Austria. Two years later he joined the Union Construction Company, where he gained experience in building incline planes and railroads. Then a year later he decided to join the Swiss National Railroad, where he was hired on as a division engineer in charge of location and construction. While living in Vienna, he attended some public engineering lectures at a local university. However, he never did actually attend the university or receive a degree. Lindenthal in fact taught himself mathematics, engineering theory, metallurgy, hydraulics, estimating, management, and everything else that a successful bridge engineer needed to know. Nevertheless, the lack of his formal education hindered him from further advancement in Europe, so he decided to emigrate to the United States in 1874. When he first arrived in the United States he was employed as a journeyman stonemason for the memorial granite building of the Centennial International Exhibition in Philadelphia (Janberg 2006). After completion of this project, Lindenthal worked for the Keystone Bridge Company of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on numerous projects over a three-year period. While working for this company, he gained valuable experience which propelled him to the status of bridge engineer. He worked for the Atlantic and Great Western Railroad during 1879 to 1881. In 1881, Lindenthal established his own consulting business and built four bridges in the Pittsburgh area: 30th Street Bridge (Herrs Island); Smithfield Street Bridge (over the Monongahela River; 1883), Youghiogheny River Bridge at McKeesport (1883); and the Seventh Street Bridge (Allegheny River; 1884). In 1884, he founded the North River Bridge Company in New York, with the intent of building a massive bridge over the Hudson River for the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR). Although the PRR ultimately decided to build tunnels under the river rather than a bridge, the two companies continued their relationship. The PRR hired Lindenthal in 1904 to work on the New York Connecting Railroad and lead the Hell Gate Bridge project. The completed bridge was dedicated by Lindenthal and the PRR on March 9, 1917. The City of New York appointed Lindenthal Commissioner of Bridges in 1902. He worked on several East River bridge projects and directed the Queensboro Bridge project, which was completed in 1909. The North River Bridge Company developed another proposal for a large Hudson River suspension bridge in 1920. This design would have been built at 57th Street in Manhattan, to carry both roadway and railroads, but neither the city nor the railroads were supportive. (Lindenthal's colleague Othmar Ammann developed a scaled-down bridge proposal several years later, which became the George Washington Bridge, completed in 1931.) Lindenthal worked on several other bridge projects around the country in the 1920s. Perhaps his most famous and lasting achievement outside of New York is the massive Sciotoville Bridge across the Ohio River, completed about the same time as the Hell Gate Bridge. At the age of eighty-five, Lindenthal succumbed to a long illness and died shortly after, at his home in Metuchen, New Jersey. Up until that point, he remained active as president and chief engineer of the North River Bridge Company. Standard engineering practices Lindenthal had a difference in opinion with one of the standard engineering practices of the day. Trains were very popular during this time and made up a majority of large bridge building that took place. Trains being as heavy as they were made engineers greatly overcompensate and build bridges that were oversized, bulky, and expensive. Lindenthal pointed out that bridges did not have to support the full load of a train. The train moves across the bridge and displaces its load evenly. This was not how the bridges were tested to see if a design worked though. The train's dead weight was simply added to the bridge, and if it did not hold, it was said to be structurally unstable. Lindenthal's idea of not having to carry the full load allowed bridge designers to create bridges that were still stable, but at the same time much lighter and cheaper. Structural accomplishments Gustav Lindenthal made bridges that reached new heights for his time. At the time of Hell Gate's completion, the bridge stood as the longest and heaviest steel bridge in the world. Gustav Lindenthal also expanded the idea of \\"double decker\\" lanes on his bridges. The Queensboro Bridge is one of the bridges Lindenthal designed that displays the double decker idea. Construction techniques During the time Lindenthal practiced engineering, the railroad industry was expanding and replacing many wooden- truss bridges with stronger ones capable of handling the heavier locomotive loads. In order to accommodate these heavier trains, different construction materials were being utilized. The materials being considered by engineers like Lindenthal were reinforced concrete, cable, and steel. Steel and reinforced concrete were two main materials used in the truss bridges Gustav Lindenthal designed. The use of reinforced concrete was a relative new idea in bridge construction, with its first use in 1889. The design of the Hell Gate Bridge required a different approach to bridge construction. Nearly all major members of Hell Gate are composed of smaller trusses. The erection of the Hell Gate was carried through without the assistance of any falsework, or work that was not part of the actual bridge. This was accomplished by building the two halves of the arch simultaneously from each tower. The steel work was supported with the use of cables during construction to carry the load of the arches until they finally met at the center of the span.Scientific American (1907-06-08). \\"Hell Gate - The Largest Arch Bridge in the World.\\" Smithfield Street Bridge In another instance, a bridge needed to be constructed over the Monongahela River, after the ferry, which was used for many years beforehand, became outdated. The first bridge, designed by John Roebling, continuously swayed and deflected, as well as being \\"shaky and loose.\\" Lindenthal was then given an opportunity to design a replacement, the Smithfield Street Bridge in Pittsburgh. This bridge, completed in 1883 using the structural form of a lenticular truss, could withstand higher stresses, as well as using resources that made it more economical (Approximately $23,000 was saved simply by using these materials). \\"Lindenthal's use of steel instead of iron wherever possible was based upon economy as much as anything.\\" Gustav Lindenthal Medal The International Bridge Conference is the site of the annual presentation of the Gustav Lindenthal Medal.

Controlled by the French government, it forms part of the Ministry of Agriculture. The organization was co-founded by Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape producer Baron Pierre Le Roy.H. Karis The Chateauneuf- du-Pape Wine Book pg 18, 254-256, 473 First Edition Kavino Publishing 2009 Every Appellation d'Origine Contr√¥l√©e (AOC), the French term for PDOs, is produced according to rules codified by the INAO. Because its primary purpose is to regulate the use of noteworthy names, one of its primary tasks is to delimit the geographic area entitled to produce a product. For wine this means vineyards, but the INAO also regulates the places of processing and aging. The INAO, like many organizations charged with regulating and helping producers, is often put in a contradictory position. An individual farmer may want his farm to be included in the limited area, but that might have the effect of diluting the average quality of the area. Rarely is this without controversy, and it is a delicate balancing act.  History  Government control of agricultural products began with the law of August 1, 1905, granting the government authority to define the official boundaries for the production of certain agricultural products. At first, the appellations were not designed as measures of quality of the produce and failed to resolve the problem of over- production of wine, a problem that continues to this day. A second law, passed on May 6, 1919, gave the courts power to act in cases where the regulations were not being followed. This once again was an initial failure, as the resulting prosecutions proved to be long and fraught with difficulty. In a further attempt to address problems in the wine industry, the INAO was created by a decree initiated by Joseph Capus and enacted on July 30, 1935. Under this law the Comit√© National des appellations d'origine (CNAO) was given the sole authority to rule on matters related to the quality of wine. The members of the committee included delegates of ministries of agriculture, finance and justice and presidents of viticulture syndicates. They consulted with the top wine producers in each region to define the boundaries of appellations and the rules for a wine to qualify. The CNAO was funded by a fee paid by the producers. Many small wine producers were eager to escape the state regulations imposed on bulk winemakers, and sought to join. However the CNAO enforced high standards and the percentage of French wine designated as AOC actually declined in the first years after the CNAO was formed. The first AOC laws were passed in 1936, and most of the classical wines from Bordeaux, Burgundy, Champagne and Rh√¥ne had their initial set of AOC regulations before the end of 1937. After World War II the committee became the public-private Institut National des Appellations d'Origine (INAO). In 1990, the economic success of the appellations led parliament in a law of July 2 to extend the powers of the INAO to cover all agricultural produce. Since January 1, 2007, the Institute is renamed Institut national de l'origine et de la qualit√© and also guarantees organic and Label Rouge certifications. In spite of the name change it retains the abbreviation INAO.

It started small in 1976 with the intent of cutting car traffic on campus; parking fees were started at the same time. In 1989 the university wanted to expand but had to agree not to increase automobile traffic on campus at all to get planning permission from the county; among other methods it expanded the shuttle from commute hours only to all-day and increased the number of routes. In the next 10 years ridership went from 700/day to 3,500/day. In 2005 the number had risen to 4,800/day. By 2013 the estimated number of passengers was 2.3 million/year (about 6,300/day). Marguerite has also acquired hybrid and all-electric buses (total fleet as of June 2015 was 79 buses of which 13 were all-electric and 5 were hybrid). The Marguerite shuttle is named for the four horse bus also called Marguerite run by Jasper Paulsen in the earliest days of the university; it initially cost 10 cents for students, 15 cents for others though the fare was later raised to 25 cents for everyone.

It lasts about 17 minutes and 50 seconds. It was Reich's first major work and a landmark in minimalism and process music. Analysis The source material of It's Gonna Rain consists entirely of a tape recording made in 1964 at San Francisco's Union Square.Steve Reich, Writings on Music: 1965-2000 (Oxford [etc.]: Oxford University Press, 2002), p. 19. In the recording, a Pentecostal preacher, Brother Walter, rails about the end of the world,Grimshaw, Jeremy. [ \\"It's Gonna Rain, for tape\\"], AllMusic.com. while accompanying background noises, including the sound of a pigeon taking flight, are heard. The piece opens with the story of Noah, and the phrase \\"It's Gonna Rain\\" is repeated and eventually looped throughout the first half of the piece. For the recording, Reich used two normal Wollensak tape recorders with the same recording, originally attempting to align the phrase with itself at the halfway point (180 degrees). However, due to the imprecise technology in 1965, the two recordings fell out of sync, with one tape gradually falling ahead or behind the other due to minute differences in the machines, the length of the spliced tape loops, and playback speed. Reich decided to exploit what is known as phase shifting, where all possible recursive harmonies are explored before the two loops eventually get back in sync. The following year, Reich created another composition, Come Out, in which the phrase \\"come out to show them\\" is looped to create the same effect. The work is in two parts of roughly equal length, the first using the \\"It's Gonna Rain\\" sample as mentioned above, the second using a separate section of the speech with short phrases cut together and the resultant pattern then phased as in the first part, but with additional tape delay to create a more processed sound. During a lecture at the Long Now Foundation, electronic musician Brian Eno cited It's Gonna Rain as his first experience with minimalism and the genre that would come to be known as ambient music.

Sage offer different products under the Sage 50 name in different regions. The product name originally derives from the UK and Ireland version of the product where the number 50 indicated that it was aimed at companies with up to 50 employees.  UK/Ireland version  In the UK and Ireland there are currently four products under the Sage 50 banner; Accounts, Payroll, HR and P11D. Sage 50cloud Accounts was the market-leading accounting solution for many years. The product currently known as Sage 50cloud Accounts has its origins in some of the earliest solutions that Sage produced. A direct relative of the current product is the Sage Sterling range which became available in September 1989 as a replacement for Sage's successful Businesswise Accounts range. Sage Sterling was available for DOS and in the early 1990s for Microsoft Windows. The product was re-branded as Sage Sterling +2 and in 1993 a version of the product became available for Apple Macintosh. By 1993 Sage Sterling was market leader having accounted for 62.5% of the integrated accounting software market. In the late 1990s, Sage Instant, a cut-down version of the product line was introduced. Later, the product was rebranded as Sage Line 50, a reference to the target market of the product, and in the 2000s was rebranded to simply Sage 50. In the 2010s cloud-connected functionality was added to the product line and the current 50cloud name began to be used.

A conversion to the Peachtree/Sage 50 data format was made available when Simply Accounting was taken off the market. In 2013 it was brought under the Sage 50 banner. Peachtree Accounting was originally sold by a software publisher founded in Atlanta in 1978 by Ben Dyer, Ron Roberts, Steve Mann, and John Hayes. The company was carved out of The Computersystem Center, an early Altair dealer founded by Roberts, Mann, Jim Dunion, and Rich Stafford, which Dyer had joined as the manager and where its first software was published in 1977. Peachtree was the first successful business software made for microcomputers, supplanting the General Ledger programmed with CBASIC and distributed by Structured Systems Group. It is the oldest microcomputer computer program for business in current use. The company expanded its offerings with its acquisition of Layered, an accounting program designed for use on the Macintosh. The company's products were included in the initial launch of the IBM Personal Computer, and it was acquired by Management Science America (MSA) in June 1981. By early 1984 InfoWorld estimated that Peachtree was the world's seventh-largest microcomputer-software company, with $21.7 million in 1983 sales. After several subsequent changes of ownership ending with ADP, Peachtree was eventually acquired by the Sage Group in 1998 for million. In the US, many schools utilize this program in their Accounting classes.

It takes place annually for three days on the 10th, 11th and 12th of August in Killorglin, County Kerry. Description Puck Fair c.1900 Every year a group of people go up into the mountains and catch a wild goat. The goat is brought back to the town and the \\"Queen of Puck\\", traditionally a young school girl from one of the local primary schools, crowns the goat \\"King Puck\\". The goat is then put into a small cage on a high stand for three days, and on the 3rd day of the fair, he is brought down to be led back to the mountains. In the middle of the town square, he is crowned and this signifies that the festivities may begin. The pubs stay open until 3.00 AM which is a legal exception due to the fair as all bars in Ireland normally must close at 2.00 AM. This is a source of contention with the local police. =Markets= Tradition dictates that a horse fair takes place on the first day and on the second day there is a cattle fair. There are usually many street vendors during the festival who advertise their wares to the large numbers of tourists who come to Killorglin for the fair. History The fair itself is purported to be ancient but can only officially be traced back as far as 1613 when King James I issued a charter granting legal status to the existing fair in Killorglin. Despite this fact, its roots are still unknown, although there are several legends of its origins. One of the legends of the fair is that the event pays tribute to a goat that broke away from its herd, while the rest of the herd headed towards the mountains, and warned the town's inhabitants while the ‚ÄúRoundheads‚Äù were pillaging the countryside around Shanara and Kilgobnet at the foot of the McGillycuddy Reeks. The advancing army of Oliver Cromwell during his conquest of Ireland in the 17th century triggered the pillages around the countryside. The goat's arrival alerted the inhabitants of danger, and they immediately set out to protect the town and their herds. This is explained in the traditional Irish ballad, An Poc ar Buile (the Mad Puck Goat). Scholars speculate that the fair's origins stem from Pre-Christian Ireland, from the Celtic festival of Lughnasa which symbolised the beginning of the harvest season, and that the goat is a pagan fertility symbol. In 1931, Margaret Murray tied the Puck Fair into her version of the witch-cult hypothesis, asserting that it was a pre-Christian festival in honour of the Horned God.

In December 2017, the station returned to adult contemporary and rebranded using its call letters. CHFM is currently hosted by Sasha Spencer & Erin Wilde in the weekdays, and Michelle Yi hosts the station during evenings & weekends.

The Socialist Propaganda League of America (SPLA) was established in 1915, apparently by C.W. Fitzgerald of Beverly, Massachusetts. The group was a membership organization established within the ranks of the Socialist Party of America and is best remembered as direct lineal antecedent of the Left Wing Section of the Socialist Party and its governing National Council ‚Äî the forerunner of the American Communist movement. Organizational history =Establishment= In the fall of 1915, C.W. Fitzgerald wrote and sent a leaflet to Vladimir Lenin of the Russian Social Democratic Workers Party. Lenin replied, outlining his views on the situation faced by the revolutionary socialist movement. It was not until November 1916 that any sort of broad-based organization was established. A November 26, 1916, meeting in Boston approved a first manifesto for the organization and established an official journal, The Internationalist. The paper was launched in Boston at the start of January 1917 and continued under that name through April of that year.Walter Goldwater, Radical Periodicals in America, 1890-1950. New Haven, CT: Yale University Library, 1964; pg. 18. The initial editor of The Internationalist was John D. Williams. According to the group's constitutional objectives, \\"The SPLA declares emphatically and will work uncompromisingly in the economic and political fields for industrial revolution to establish industrial democracy by the mass action of the working class.\\" =Move to New York= In January 1917, editor Williams traveled to New York City in order to raise money for the Socialist Propaganda League and its newly launched paper.Theodore Draper, The Roots of American Communism. New York: Viking Press, 1957; pg. 86. Williams made the acquaintance of a young Italian-American radical named Louis C. Fraina, until recently a key editor at the now-defunct magazine The New Review. Williams sought an experienced editor to take over the publication and a compact was made. Beginning with an issue dated April 21, 1917, The Internationalist was moved to New York City and published by the Socialist Propaganda League as The New International.Goldwater, Radical Periodicals in America, 1890-1950, pg. 27. Louis Fraina became the publication's editor at that date. The publication was financed through donations made by Dutch engineer and left wing socialist S.J. Rutgers. Circulation was small, estimated by historian Theodore Draper at \\"no more than a thousand copies of each issue,\\" which served to limit the paper's influence.Draper, The Roots of American Communism, pg. 87. Nevertheless, Draper and other historians of the American left regard The Internationalist and its successor as the first propaganda organs of the movement which congealed as the Left Wing Section of the Socialist Party in 1919 ‚Äî forerunner of the American communist movement. In April 1917, the name of the SPL's newspaper was changed to The New International and it was moved to New York City, to be edited by Louis C. Fraina. In January 1918, in the aftermath of the Bolshevik victory in Russia and the establishment of a Revolutionary Socialist regime there, the SPLA issue a second manifesto of the organization. The manifesto denounced \\"bourgeois democracy\\" as a \\"fraud\\" by means of which \\"Imperialism promotes the most brutal interests,\\" advocated for \\"the unity of industrial action and Socialist politics,\\" argued that \\"the revolution of the proletariat annihilates the parliamentary regime and its state\\" and instead establishes a new form of government based upon workers' councils that combine legislative and executive authority. The SPLA stated in this manifesto that \\"the organization is formed to work in the Socialist Party as well as independently of the party\\" and for \\"the revolutionary reorganization of the American Socialist movement\\" both from within and without the SPA. The organization achieved a significant degree of public notice as leading exponents of the Bolshevik Revolution in the United States. On February 28, 1918, a mass meeting was held in a New York City hall at which Louis Fraina quixotically called for the establishment of a \\"Red Guard\\" of draft age men to be sent to Soviet Russia to fight for the Bolshevik government against the German army then invading the country.\\"Ask Wilson's Leave to Fight for Russia: Harlem Socialists Move to Organize a \\"Red Guard\\" Here of Men Above Draft Age,\\" New York Times, March 1, 1918; pg. 2. The meeting of about 2,000 people was also addressed by writer Andre Tridon as well as IWW poet Arturo Giovanitti. =Invitation to join the Communist International= The Socialist Propaganda League called for a new revolutionary socialist International and was invited by name to attend the founding Congress of the Communist International in 1919. The organization, however, was unable to send a representative in time to attend the gathering. =Dissolution and legacy= A total of 12 issues of The New International are known to have been produced through October 1918.Walter Goldwater in his bibliography of the radical press in America indicated some confusion about the date of termination, stating that 11 issues were known, with Stanford University Library stating that publication continued through October. See: Goldwater, Radical Periodicals in America, 1890-1950, pg. 27. The discovery of a \\"September‚ÄìOctober 1918\\" issue number 12 in the collection of the Wisconsin Historical Society has definitively ended this debate, however. The New International was directly succeeded by The Revolutionary Age, also edited by Fraina, with the first issue of that paper appearing in the middle of November.Goldwater, Radical Periodicals in America, 1890-1950, pg. 35. \\"The League is still in existence, but its paper is no longer published, since The Revolutionary Age expresses its policy,\\" Fraina noted in March 1919. Prominent members of the SPL joined the new Communist Party of America, which eventually merged with the Communist Labor Party to form first the Workers Party of America and eventually the Communist Party USA.

Today based in the English town of Paignton, the company supplies its products worldwide, and until 2014 was part of the Vilmorin Clause & Compagnie group of companies. History =Founding= An 1886 advertisement Suttons Seeds were founded in the Berkshire town of Reading in 1806Earley Local History Group. (2006) Suttons Seeds: A History 1806-2006. Reading: Earley Local History Group, p. 1. by John Sutton (1777-1863). Originally the company traded as corn merchants and were known as the 'House of Sutton'. In 1832 John Sutton was joined in the business by his sons, Martin Hope (1815-1901) and Alfred (d. 1897). In 1837 the business moved to Reading's Market Place, where the sons persuaded their father to expand into the flower and vegetable seed trade. From this time on the firm progressed and expanded rapidly, earning a reputation for supplying pure, unadulterated seed. The Market Place shop occupied a prominent position overlooking the Saturday vegetable and general market. Martin Hope acquired nursery grounds in Queens Road along with a greenhouse. By mid-1838 he began selling greenhouse plants, many of the bulbs coming from local nurseries, but some from the Netherlands. In 1836 Martin Hope, aged 21 years, became a partner and the 'House of Sutton' became Sutton & Son. Suttons established their own laboratory to test seeds for germination and purity in 1840. In the same year, the company became one of the first to take advantage of the opening of the Great Western Railway through Reading. The railway was responsible both for bringing in large consignments of seeds and bulbs, and for carrying outgoing mail orders to all parts of the country. =Royal patronage= Suttons received royal patronage in 1858, when Queen Victoria requested Martin Hope Sutton to supply seeds to the royal household. Suttons Seeds have held a Royal Warrant ever since, and are currently suppliers to Queen Elizabeth. In 1873, extensive new offices and warehouses replaced the original premises, albeit still fronting Market Place. These occupied a considerable part of central Reading, stretching back apremises included offices, different store rooms for various seeds and bulbs, an exhibition department, stables and even a works fire station. During the 1880s the company funded a Mission Room in Albert Road Reading and presumably employed a Mission Woman, Susan Warwick. (Census 1881) =20th century= In 1911, the company donated money towards the setting up of a new hall at the then University College Reading (later to become the University of Reading), providing half the funds for Wessex Hall (Brown, 2006). In 1962, Suttons moved again to new show grounds and premises on the then main A4 road just to the east of Reading. In 1965, Suttons were the first company to offer foil packets to the amateur gardener in the UK. The company relocated from Reading to Torquay in the county of Devon 1976 and in 1998 moved again to brand new premises in the nearby town of Paignton. In December 2014, the company was taken over by a management buyout. The Museum of English Rural Life holds records for the company including accounts, administrative and commercial records, publications and advertising, international photographic records, records of exhibitions and personal records plus over 100 objects used and made by Suttons, including sacks, signs and seeds.

The name derives from the name of the village Belokrinitsa, where the full hierarchy of the Russian Orthodox Oldrite Church was established. From the end of 1840, when the Belokrinitskaya Hierarchy was accepted by the Belokrinitskoe soglasie these two terms became almost synonymous (at least when spoken about Old Believers in Russia, but not in Austria-Hungary, Romania and Moldova). In the 20th century the term Belokrinitskoe soglasie is synonymous with Russian Orthodox Old-Rite Church. Some confusions may occur when using the term Belokrinitskoe soglasie in respect to a schism of Okruzhniki and Neokruzhniki. From one point of view, both sides of a schism originated from the Rogozhskoe cemetery administrative system and so both belong to the Belokrinitskoe soglasie From the other side, the Rogozhskoe cemetery priests and authorities were Okruzhniki almost entirely, so the term Belokrinitskoe soglasie can sometimes mean Okruzhniki.

In 1927, some NSDAP workers in large factories, located mostly in the Berlin area, joined together as an alternative to social democratic and Christian labor unions. The NSBO was established in 1928 by these groups.Reinhard K√ºhnl, Die nationalsozialistische Linke 1925‚Äì1930, Marburger Abhandlungen zur Politischen Wissenschaft Vol. 6, Meisenheim am Glan 1966. On 15 January 1931, the NSBO was declared a \\"Reichsbetriebszellenabteilung\\" (German Reich Factory Cell Organization) of the Nazi Party. It began to increase its membership by means of aggressive campaigns, which included both propaganda and violence, under the war-cry: \\"Hinein in die Betriebe!\\" (Into the Factories!), which was shortened to \\"Hib\\".Reinhard Giersch, Nationalsozialistische Betriebszellen-Organisation (NSBO) 1930 (1931)‚Äì1934 (1935), in Fricke, Dieter (Hrsg.), Lexikon zur Parteiengeschichte. Die b√ºrgerlichen und kleinb√ºrgerlichen Parteien und Verb√§nde in Deutschland (1789‚Äì1945), Vol. 3, Leipzig 1985, Pages 454‚Äì459. The NSBO had overall little success among German organized workers, except in certain regions where they supported strikes, such as the 1932 Berlin transport strike. As a result of the \\"Hib\\" campaign, the NSBO increased its membership to only about 300,000 by the end of 1931, while the Democratic and Christian labor unions had still well over 5 million members.Volker Kratzenberg, Arbeiter auf dem Weg zu Hitler? Die Nationalsozialistische Betriebszellen-Organisation. Ihre Entstehung, ihre Programmatik, ihr Scheitern 1927‚Äì1934, Frankfurt/Bern/New York 1987. Some sections of the NSBO had an ideology similar to National Bolshevism. They believed that after the \\"national revolution\\" occurred, a \\"social revolution\\" had to follow, to do away with the existing elites.Louis Dupeux, ‚ÄûNationalbolschewismus‚Äú in Deutschland 1919‚Äì1933. Kommunistische Strategie und konservative Dynamik, M√ºnchen 1985. This attitude earned them sympathies in some places, like in Nordhorn, a textile industrial city in the county of Bentheim, where the NSBO defeated the formerly strong Communist labor unions in the industrial worker council elections in 1933.Werner Rohr, Nationalbolschewistische Tendenzen in der Nordhorner NSDAP, Bentheimer Jahrbuch 1987, Bad Bentheim 1987, Pages 107‚Äì112. The NSBO's methods then included using armed violence in order to offset a salary reduction in a particular factory.Helmut Lensing, Die Nationalsozialistische Betriebszellen-Organisation und die NS-Machtergreifung in der Grafschaft Bentheim, Bentheimer Jahrbuch 1993 (= Das Bentheimer Land Vol 125), Bad Bentheim 1992, Pages 167‚Äì194. After all non-Nazi trade unions were outlawed by decree on 2 May 1933, the NSBO became the only official workers' organization in Germany. This moment of glory, however, was short, for the German Labour Front (DAF) was established a few days later. More organized and better represented at national level, the DAF ended up absorbing the NSBO in 1935.Gunther Mai, Die Nationalsozialistische Betriebszellen- Organisation.

Areas with trends of <95% probability in white. The Sahel has long experienced a series of historic droughts, dating back to at least the 17th century. The Sahel region is a climate zone sandwiched between the Sudanian Savanna to the south and the Sahara desert to the north, across West and Central Africa. While the frequency of drought in the region is thought to have increased from the end of the 19th century, three long droughts have had dramatic environmental and societal effects upon the Sahel nations. Famine followed severe droughts in the 1910s, the 1940s, and the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, although a partial recovery occurred from 1975-80. The most recent drought occurred in 2012. While at least one particularly severe drought has been confirmed each century since the 17th century, the frequency and severity of recent Sahelian droughts stands out. Famine and dislocation on a massive scale‚Äîfrom 1968 to 1974 and again in the early and mid-1980s‚Äîwas blamed on two spikes in the severity of the 1960-1980s drought period.The Sahel region; assessing progress twenty-five years after the great drought. Simon Batterbury, republished paper from 1998 RGS-IBG conference. Global Environmental Change (2001) v11, no 1, 1-95. From the late 1960s to early 1980s famine killed 100,000 people, left 750,000 dependent on food aid, and affected most of the Sahel's 50 million people.AFRICA ENVIRONMENT OUTLOOK. Past, present and future perspectives. United Nations Environmental Programme (2002). Retrieved 2009-02-13. The economies, agriculture, livestock and human populations of much of Mauritania, Mali, Chad, Niger and Burkina Faso (known as Upper Volta during the time of the drought) were severely impacted. As disruptive as the droughts of the late 20th century were, evidence of past droughts recorded in Ghanaian lake sediments suggest that multi-decadal megadroughts were common in West Africa over the past 3,000 years and that several droughts lasted far longer and were far more severe.Severity, Length of Past Megadroughts Dwarf Recent Drought in West Africa. Jackson School of Geosciences Online, April 16, 2009. Since the 1980s, summer rainfall in the Sahel has been increasing; this has been associated with an increase in vegetation, forming what has been called a 'greening' of the Sahel. The observed increase in rainfall is accounted for by enhancements in the African easterly jet, which is known to induce wet anomalies. A 2011 study found that the positional shifts in the African easterly jet and African easterly waves accompanied the northward migration of the Sahel rainband.Wang and Gillies (2011) History Because the Sahel's rainfall is heavily concentrated in a very small period of the year, the region has been prone to dislocation when droughts have occurred ever since agriculture developed around 5,000 years ago. The Sahel is marked by rainfalls of less than a year, almost all of which occurs in one continuous season, which can run from several weeks to four months. Despite this vulnerability, the history of drought and famine in the Sahel do not perfectly correlate. While modern scientific climate and rainfall studies have been able to identify trends and even specific periods of drought in the region, oral and written records over the last millennium do not record famine in all places at all times of drought. One 1997 study, in attempting to map long scale rainfall records to historical accounts of famine in Northern Nigeria, concluded that ‚Äúthe most disruptive historical famines occurred when the cumulative deficit of rainfall fell below 1.3 times the standard deviation of long-term mean annual rainfall for a particular place.‚ÄùAondover Tarhule1 and Ming-Ko Woo. ‚ÄòTowards an Interpretation of Historical Droughts in Northern Nigeria‚Äô Climatic Change, no 37, 1997. pp.601-613 The 1982 to 1984 period, for instance, was particularly destructive to the pastoral Fula people of Senegal, Mali and Niger, and the Tuareg of northern Mali and Niger. The populations had not only suffered in the 1968 to 1974 period, but the inability of many to rebuild herds destroyed a decade earlier, along with factors as various as the shift of political power to settled populations with independence in the 1960s, Senegalese-Mauritanian border relations, and Niger's dependence upon falling world uranium prices coinciding in a destructive famine.David Tenenbaum.

Draper Fund Report, 1985 Sept(14):17-9. =600‚Äì700 AD= Surviving contemporary records of climate in the Sahel begin with early Muslim travellers in the early Medieval Warm Period. These suggest that Sahel rainfall was relatively low in the 7th and 8th centuries and then increased substantially from about 800 AD. There was a decline in rainfall from about 1300 AD, but an increase again around 200 years later. =\\"Little Ice Age\\" droughts= According to a study of West African drought based on Ghanaian lake sediments (not eyewitness historical accounts) published in the journal Science in April 2009: > The most recent of these [multicentury droughts] occurred between 1400 and > 1750 CE (550 to 200 yr B.P.), similar in timing to the Little Ice Age (LIA, > 1400 to 1850 CE), a well-known interval when Northern Hemisphere > temperatures were cooler than at present.

Evidence for LIA drought is not restricted to Africa, > however. Records from throughout the tropics, including the western Pacific > warm pool, the Arabian Sea, continental Asia, and tropical South America all > show evidence for dry conditions during this time period. 1640 The first major historically recorded drought in the Sahel occurred around 1640. Based on the reports of European travellers, a major drought after generally wet conditions also took place during the 1680s. 1740s and 1750s Cycles of several wet decades followed by a drought were to be repeated during the 18th century. Sahelian drought again killed hundreds of thousands of people in the 1740s and 1750s. The 1740s and 1750s was recorded in chronicles of what is today Northern Nigeria, Niger and Mali as the \\"Great Famine\\", the worst for at least 200 years prior. It caused massive dislocation of the Sahelian states of the time, but also disrupted the Trans Saharan trade routes to North Africa and Europe.Paul E. Lovejoy and Stephen Baier. The Desert-Side Economy of the Central Sudan. The International Journal of African Historical Studies, Vol. 8, No. 4 (1975), pp. 551-581 1830s Around 1790 dry conditions similar to those of the late 20th century set in and continued until around 1870. After that, a very wet period set in for around 25 years, followed by a return to drier conditions. While the drying begun around 1895 and caused its first large famine only in the early 20th century, the 1820s and 1830s saw a 12 to 15-year drought and regional instances of major famine from Senegal to Chad. Historical records suggest this drought caused a large-scale emigration from the Bornu Empire, contributing to its rapid decline in the 19th century. In what is now northern Senegal, the Imamate of Futa Toro was struck by a famine caused by the failure of 1833's rainy season, leading to waves of famine until 1837.Philip D.

University of Wisconsin Press (1975) =Early 20th century droughts= The first rain gauges in the Sahel date from 1898 and they reveal that a major drought in the 1910s, accompanied by large-scale famine, was followed by wet conditions during the 1920s and 1930s, reaching a peak with the very wet year of 1936. The 1940s saw several minor droughts ‚Äî notably in 1949 ‚Äî but the 1950s were consistently wet, and expansion of agriculture to feed growing populations characterised this decade. Many have thought this contributed to the severity of the subsequent Sahel droughts. =Late 20th century droughts= Burkina Faso, northern Nigeria, southern Niger, far northern Cameroon (near Lake Chad) and central Chad all struggled with dwindling rain fall from the 1960s. On May 12 and 26, both Mauritania, the S√©n√©gal River Area and neighbouring parts of both Senegal and Mali faced both a drought and famine. A literature review from the African Journal of Ecology summarized the environmental changes that species faced after the late 20th century droughts, some of which includes (but is not limited to) severe declines in biodiversity and increases in other disturbances, such as fires. =21st century droughts= 2010 Sahel drought Throughout June to August 2010, famine struck the Sahel. Niger's crops failed to mature in the heat which resulted in famine. 350,000 faced starvation and 1,200,000 were at risk of famine. In Chad, the temperature reached on June 22 in Faya-Largeau, breaking a record set in 1961 at the same location. Niger tied its highest temperature record set in 1998, on also June 22, at in Bilma. That record was broken the next day, on June 23 when Bilma hit . The hottest temperature recorded in Sudan was reached on June 25, at in Dongola, breaking a record set in 1987. Niger reported diarrhoea, starvation, gastroenteritis, malnutrition and respiratory diseases killed and sickened many children July 14. The new military junta appealed for international food aid and has taken serious steps to calling overseas help since coming to office in February 2010. On July 26 the heat reached near-record levels over Chad and Niger. 2012 Sahel drought By the middle of 2010, another drought in the western Sahel was predicted by several organisations for 2011 and 2012. Potential contributing factors Originally it was believed that the drought in the Sahel primarily was caused by humans over-using natural resources in the region through overgrazing, deforestation and poor land management. In the late 1990s, climate model studies suggested that large scale climate changes were also triggers for the drought. Based on Senegal river cycles, precipitation cycles of various El Sahel stations which are related to Solar (89‚Äì120 years) Wolf- Gleissberg cycles, and on relations to Nile floods and Equatorial lake levels, Yousef and Ghilly in 2000 anticipated that there is a considerable probability that drought will occur El Sahel Zone in 2005¬±4 years. This forecast was correct as drought occurred in El Niger in 2005 and again in 2010. In 2002, after the phenomenon of global dimming was discovered, a CSIRO study suggested that the drought was probably caused by air pollution generated in Eurasia and North America, which changed the properties of clouds over the Atlantic Ocean, disturbing the monsoons and shifting the tropical rains southwards. In 2005, a series of climate modeling studies performed at NOAA / Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory indicated that the late 20th century Sahel drought was probably a climatic response to changing sea surface temperature patterns, and that it could be viewed as a combination of natural variability superimposed upon an anthropogenically forced regional drying trend. Using GFDL CM2.X, these climate model simulations indicated that the general late 20th century Sahel drying trend was attributable to human-induced factors; largely due to an increase in greenhouse gases and partly due to an increase in atmospheric aerosols. A study published in 2013, done at the University of Washington, suggests that atmospheric aerosols caused a downward shift in the Intertropical Convergence Zone. The shift, the study says, left normally rainy areas in Central Africa much drier. In IPCC future scenario A2 (CO2 value of ‚âà860 ppm) Sahel rainfall could be reduced by up to 25% by year 2100, according to climate models. A 2006 study by NOAA scientists suggests that the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation plays a leading role. An AMO warm phase strengthens the summer rainfall over Sahel, while a cold phase reduces it. The AMO entered a warm phase in 1995 and, assuming a 70-year cycle (following peaks in ‚âà1880 and ‚âà1950), will peak around 2020. A 2009 study found further evidence for a link between the AMO and West African drought. Later, a 2013 studyBarandiaran and Wang (2013) http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asl2.457/abstract found that the East Atlantic (EA) mode also modulates Sahel summer rainfall and further indicated that operational climate forecasting was unable to capture this EA impact on the Sahel. The recovery of Sahel drought since the 1990s, coined \\"Sahel Greening\\" by media, is accounted for by enhancements in both the tropical easterly jet and the African easterly jet, both of which are known to induce wet anomalies. Moreover, positional shifts in the African easterly jet and African easterly waves (AEWs) accompanied the northward migration of the Sahel rainband. Change in the African easterly jet and AEWs are coupled to a northward shift and amplification of convective activity. United Nations response In 1973, The United Nations Sahelian Office (UNSO) was created to address the problems of drought in the Sahel region following the West African Sahel drought of 1968-73. In the 1990s, the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) was adopted and UNSO became the United Nations Development Programme's Office to Combat Desertification and Drought, as its scope broadened to be global rather than only focused on Africa.

It is a popular destination for day trips. Due to the high amount of silver mining, it was previously known as \\"Erzkasten\\" (literally \\"ore box\\"); the name \\"Schouwesland\\" first appeared in 1347. The mountain is located roughly ten kilometres south-east of Freiburg‚Äôs city centre.  Geography  The summit of the Schauinsland is located in the district of Freiburg. The mountain is surrounded by towns such as Oberried, Munstertal, Bollschweil, and Horben (clockwise). The closest village to the summit is Hofsgrund. In Autumn especially, during a temperature inversion, there is a clear view of the Vosges mountains from the top of the Schauinsland. Under appropriate weather conditions there is a view of a large portion of the Swiss Alps. The Swiss Alps as seen from the Schauinsland Since 2003, the Holzschl√§germatte on the Schauinsland has been home to a number of very controversial wind turbines. Due to conservation issues (the summit of the Schauinsland is part of a nature reserve), they were constructed at an elevation of roughly 1,000 m above sea level instead of on the summit. Therefore, the view to and from the summit is only slightly restricted. During the lawsuit against the operating company, the Freiburg-based artist Richard Schindler wrote an expert report which is considered the first of its kind. The Schauinsland with its wind turbines as seen from Freiburg  History  = Mining = For over 700 years, silver, lead and zinc were mined from the Schauinsland. In the Middle Ages, mining was very productive, so much so that in the 14th century a number of contractors of the Dieselmuot mine could afford to donate glass windows to the Freiburg Minster. The miners lived right next to the mines on the Schauinsland in two settlements, which were abandoned during the 16th century. The silver obtained was traded and used for minting coins. The mining tunnels are spread over 22 levels and amount to a total of about 100 kilometers. At the beginning of the 20th century, about 250 miners were employed in the Schauinsland mines. Production ceased in 1954 due to the mine not yielding enough economy.  Kapplerstollen  There is a tunnel, the so-called Kapplerstollen, which connects the villages Kappel and Hofsgrund. It is also referred to as \\"midwife's tunnel\\" due to the fact that around the end of the 19th century midwives, as well as the children of Kappel, used it as a shortcut to Hofsgrund. The tunnel still exists, however, its entries are no longer accessible.Mining Museum Schauinsland schauinsland.de. Retrieved 2 August 2018 (German) Since 1975, the Barbarastollen, a reconstructed part of the mine, has been used by the Federal Office for Civil Protection and Emergency Aid as a storage facility for Germany's archived materials. The tunnel is Europe's largest long-term archive.  Mining museum  The research team Steiber, founded in 1976, cleared and surveyed several old parts of the mine. A part of an old ore mine has been transformed into a museum that has been open to the public since 1997. On tours, visitors are shown a wide range of medieval tunnels and shafts from the final stages of when the mine was in operation. = Schauinsland Race = Between 1923 and 1984, a legendary hillclimb race called the \\"ADAC Schauinsland-Rennen\\" took place on the Schauinslandstra√üe. The 12 km long route winds its way up public roads from Horben over the Holzschl√§germatte to the cable car station at the top of the mountain. Since 2000, this traditional motorsport event has taken place on a shortened route up to the Holzsch√§germatte, but only as a parade for classic cars. Since 1984, the Schauinslandstra√üe has been shut for motorcyclists between 1 April and 1 November, as well as at weekends and on public holidays. = Schauinslandk√∂nig (Schauinsland King) = Since 2007, there has been a hillclimb event on the L-124- \\"race course\\" from Horben to the chairlift station. It attracts over 1,000 participants a year, including racing cyclists, but also bikes with the capacity to tow children, tandem bikes, unicyclists, handicapped riders, inline skaters and roller skiers. They climb the so-called Schauinslandk√∂nig (Schauinsland King) which is a distance of 11.5 km with a 770 m climb. = Berghaus (Mountain House) = The Berghaus In 1936, a hotel with 26 rooms and 74 beds was built on the mountain. This was used by the French Commandant from the end of the war to 1952. In 1958, it was used as a children's recreation centre and later as a halls of residence building for the town of Pforzheim. In 1989, it was used by the town of Freiburg as a home for refugees up until 1992 when it was used as a student halls of residence. A doctor from the Groddeck Hospital then tried to convert the building into a 48-bed rehabilitation centre, but this failed due to changes in health legislation and lack of credit. This led to its bankruptcy in late 2000. The building was empty from 2001 and the new doors and windows were vandalised. In 2011, the Berghaus was acquired by three couples from Freiburg, who wanted to convert the building into a conference centre and holiday home in the spring of 2015. They were supported in this endeavour by members of the Service Civil International. However, the project did not find enough support and the house is now due to be sold again. = Mountain hotel = Berghotel Schauinsland In 1869, the stage manager of the municipal theater in Freiburg built and ran a cottage to the south-west of the peak. After various changes, the guest house \\"Zur Friedrichsruhe\\" emerged, also known as \\"Berghotel Schauinsland\\" (mountain hotel Schauinsland). After a fire in 1926, the house was reconstructed to its current form. From 1936 to 1982, Heinrich Sauerer ran the mountain hotel together with his family. Afterwards, the workers' welfare union ran the guesthouse as a conference and meeting place for groups for thirteen years. As of 2006, the house, including 50 beds, can be fully rented. It is also the location of a detective novel.Karin Schickinger: Sch√ºsse am Schauinsland, Highlights-Verlag, Euskirchen 2012,  Protected areas  As of 12 December 2002, the Schauinsland's summit and the surrounding areas are protected by the regional council as a nature reserve (NSG number 3.264) within the natural environment of the High Black Forest. It encompasses an area of almost 1,054 ha, whereby 329.7 ha are part of Freiburg im Breisgau and 724.2 ha are part of the rural district Breisgau-High Black Forest. It is classified in the fourth IUCN category. The CDDA code is 319058. The nature reserve is supplemented by a conservation area of the same name, which has also been documented in the bylaw of December 2002. It incorporates the \\"Freiburger Bergwald\\" at the north-west slope of the Schauinsland, the \\"Kappler Tal\\" with a small and a big valley at the district of Kappel, the countryside south-west of \\"Brugge\\" and west of the L126 between \\"Kirchzarten-Bruckm√ºhle\\" and the \\"Hohen Br√ºcke\\" by St. Wilhelm, the countryside south-west of the \\"Trubelmattkopf\\" to the \\"Widener Eck\\" and east of the \\"Stampfbachtal\\" from \\"Oberneuhof\\" to \\"Spielweg\\" at the district of \\"Oberm√ºnstertal\\", as well as the meadows at the \\"Kohlerh√∂fen\\" in the district of \\"Ehrenstetten\\" within the nature reserve. Altogether, the landscape conservation area spans 5,484 ha, of which 1,741 ha can be attributed to the urban district of Freiburg (under the number 3.11.008) and 3,743 ha can be attributed to the rural district Breisgau-High Black Forest (under the number 3.15.032).  Points of interest  = Fallerh√§usle = The Fallerh√§usle is a miner's house which is located about a kilometer below the visitors' entrance to the mine. It is a smaller version of the Schauinslandhaus. In the middle of the 18th century, there was great disagreement between the Hofsgrunder farmers and the mine owners concerning this miner's house. The mine owners had hired mountain experts/miners from Tyrol without taking care of housing possibilities for the men. Because of this, the Tyroleans were allowed to build their own small houses on the dumps and pits. = Wind beeches = Wind beeches on the Schauinsland Due to its exposed location on the \\"Rheinebene\\" which the Schauinsland rises from, there is a lot of strong wind, mainly from the west. Over the course of many decades, this has led to unusual forms of the red beech trees growing there. = Schniederlihof = Above \\"Hofsgrund\\" you can visit the Schniederlihof, a Black Forest farm house which was built in 1593. Schnieder is the Allemanic form of the name Schneider. Since the man was not a giant, Schneider became Schniederli (diminutive form). Until 1966, the farm was still managed and since 1972 it has been a local museum and can be visited from May to October. The farm is located at 1050 meters above sea level and can be reached on foot from the Hofsgrund church in 30 minutes. = Schauinslandbahn = The Schauinslandbahn From Freiburg (valley station Horben), the Schauinsland can be reached by Germany's longest cable car. The so-called Schauinslandbahn ascends a height of 746 m and has a length of 3600 m. The 37 cabins can transport up to 700 people per hour, which is about 240,000 passengers per year. The Schauinslandbahn came into operation in 1930 as the world's first cable railway according to the circulation principle. The lower station of the Schauinslandbahn can be reached by bus route 21 from the terminus of Freiburg city tram route 2 at G√ºnterstal. All three lines are operated by VAG Freiburg, the city transport operator for Freiburg. During the winter time, every couple of years, the Schauinsland cable car can be used as a ski lift when ideal snow conditions permit. About 300 metres from the carpark \\"Rotlache\\" and under the mountain station, the \\"cold water run\\" begins. Known as the \\"wild run\\", it is highly treacherous, being over 8 km away from the valley station, thus making it the longest ski-run in the Black Forest. = Schauinsland Tower = The Eugen Keidel Tower Built in 1981, and named after the former Mayor of Freiburg Eugen Keidel, the lookout built on the summit of the Schauinsland is the start of many hiking routes within the local mountainous region. From the viewing platform, roughly 20 metres high, Mont Blanc can also be seen, which is not possible at the base of the tower due to the ski resort \\"Haldenk√∂pfle\\" just in front. = The \\"Engl√§nderdenkmal\\" (Englishmen Memorial) = The \\"Engl√§nderdenkmal\\" On 17 April 1936, a group of English students from the Strand School, along with their teacher Kenneth Keast, hiked up Schauinsland, attempting to reach Todtnauberg, a challenging hike even in favourable conditions. Severe weather had been predicted, and the group was inadequately equipped and clothed. It was already snowing when they left Freiburg, and despite several local people advising Keast not to walk on Schauinsland in such weather, they went on. Just short of the summit, they were engulfed in a blizzard, and severely lost. Hours later, part of the group finally made it to Hofsgrund, from where a search party immediately set off to rescue the scattered group from storm and darkness. Four of the group of 27 were already frozen to death or had died from exhaustion, and another one was very critical and died on the following day. This tragic event is locally known as the \\"Engl√§nderungl√ºck\\", literally \\"Englishmen‚Äôs calamity\\". In 1938, in memory of this event, architect Hermann Alker from Karlsruhe erected a memorial for the deceased English students. This memorial, however, became a significant site for the Hitler Youth who used the monument for the purpose of propaganda. After the Second World War, \\"Hitler Youth\\" in the inscription was replaced by \\"Youth of Germany\\", and the swastika and imperial eagle on the top bar were removed. Eaton cross = Eaton cross = Jack Eaton, father of one of the deceased students, had a stone cross erected at the spot where his son, Jack Alexander Eaton, had been found lifeless. This cross is locally known as \\"Kleines Engl√§nderdenkmal\\", literally \\"Little Memorial to the English\\". It bears a German inscription on the mountain side, and an equivalent English inscription on the valley side. Eaton intended to add the line, \\"Their teacher failed them in the hour of trial\\", but this was disallowed, as the official version of the event exonerated the teacher.  Observatories  The solar telescope on the Schauinsland On the Schauinsland, there is a solar telescope,Schauinsland Galerie kis.uni-freiburg.de. Retrieved 2 August 2018 which is operated by the Kiepenheuer Institute for Solar Physics, which nowadays is only used for teaching and PR. Current research is mostly done at the Observatorio del Teide on Tenerife. The observatory can be visited without pre-booking on five open days between May and September, each of which is scheduled at the beginning of the year. On those days guided tours take place between 11 A.M and 3 P.M. The observatory was founded in 1943 by the German Luftwaffe of the Third Reich to make the most accurate prediction of the ideal frequency for military radio communication by observing the solar activities. It was managed by Karl-Otto Kiepenheuer from 1943 until 1975. There is also an air measuring station on Schauinsland which belongs to the German environmental federal agency and the federal agency for radiation protection. The concentration of air pollutants is measured as part of the European Monitoring and Evaluation Program (EMEP), the climate-relevant gasses and radionuclides are recorded as part of the GAW. Both this building and the solar telescope were built in 1943 and were used to observe the quality of the ionosphere for the purpose of military radio communication. A measuring station for the permanent monitoring of the artificial and natural radioactivity in the atmosphere has existed on the Schauinsland since 1957. It was integrated into the newly founded federal agency for radiation protection in 1989. Among other devices to measure traces of radioactivity in the air, the \\"Ortsdosisleistungs-Messnetz\\" and the supervision of the adherence to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) takes place there.  Recreational activities  The Schauinsland is a very popular area for Freiburg and the region as it is suitable for a number of outdoor adventurous activities including hiking, skiing and mountain biking. In the winter, sledging is possible on the Holzschl√§germatte or on the higher areas of the mountain where a sledge-lift operates. Cyclists can visit the Schauinsland for both challenging and leisurely trails and use the Schauinslandbahn to help them ascend the mountain. From May to November, it is possible to go down the mountain using a hired scooter, which takes about an hour. The area right below the top station is a popular starting position for paragliders.

This body of work proposes that authority is rooted in individuals' knowledge (their perspectives), and the power that such authority exerts. Standpoint theory's most important concept is that an individual's own perspectives are shaped by his or her social and political experiences. Standpoints are argued to be multifaceted rather than essentializing: for example, while Hispanic women may generally share some perspectives, particularly with regard to ethnicity or sex, they are not defined solely by these viewpoints despite some common features there is no essentially Hispanic female identity. Group experiences create a general and permanent perspective of an immense situation but without personal experiences one‚Äôs standpoint cannot become truly comprehensible. The amalgamation of a person's many experienced dimensions form a standpoint‚Äîa point of view‚Äîthrough which that individual sees and understands the world. Standpoint theorists emphasize the utility of a naturalistic, or everyday experiential, concept of knowing (i.e., epistemology). One's standpoint (whether reflexively considered or not) shapes which concepts are intelligible, which claims are heard and understood by whom, which features of the world are perceptually salient, which reasons are understood to be relevant and forceful, and which conclusions credible. Standpoint theory supports what feminist theorist Sandra Harding calls strong objectivity, or the notion that the perspectives of marginalized and/or oppressed individuals can help to create more objective accounts of the world. Through the outsider-within phenomenon, these individuals are placed in a unique position to point to patterns of behavior that those immersed in the dominant group culture are unable to recognize. Standpoint theory gives voice to the marginalized groups by allowing them to challenge the status quo as the outsider within. The status quo representing the dominant white male position of privilege. The predominant culture in which all groups exist is not experienced in the same way by all persons or groups. The views of those who belong to groups with more social power are validated more than those in marginalized groups. Those in marginalized groups must learn to be bicultural, or to \\"pass\\" in the dominant culture to survive, even though that perspective is not their own.DeFrancisco, Victoria P. Communicating Gender Diversity: A Critical Approach. Thousand Oaks: Sage Publications, INC., 2007. History The original inspirations for standpoint theory can be seen in the works of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, a German idealist philosopher, who studied the different standpoints between slaves and masters in 1807.Wood, J.T. (2008). Critical feminist theories. In L.A. Baxter & D.O. Braithwaite (Eds.), Engaging theories in interpersonal communication: Multiple perspectives (pp. 323-334). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage. He claimed that the master-slave relationship is about people's belonging positions, and the groups affect how people receive knowledge and power. Essential Work on the relation between social Standpoints and Knowledge, i.e. worldview has been put forward by one of the founders of sociology of Knowledge Karl Mannheim, which is often overlooked. The concept has long been discussed in Sociology of Knowledge, also in confrontation with Critical Theory in the Frankfurt School where it was considered relativistic (Mannheim vs. Horkheimer). Newer developments in Feminist studies have a similar point, but focusing on some aspects,e.g. Nancy Hartsock examined standpoint theory by using relations between men and women. She published \\"The Feminist Standpoint: Developing Ground for a Specifically Feminist Historical Materialism\\" in 1983. Hartsock used Hegel's ideas of masters and slaves and Marx's ideas of class and capitalism as an inspiration to look into matters of sex and gender. Contemporary standpoint theory often focuses on the social positions such as gender, race, class, culture, and economic status.Wallance, R. A., and A. Wolf (1995). Contemporary Sociological Theory: Continuing the classical tradition. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall. Standpoint theory seeks to develop a particular feminist epistemology, that values the experiences of women and minorities as a source for knowledge.McCann and Kim, Feminist Theory Reader: Local and global perspectives, 2003.. Prominent standpoint theorists include Dorothy Smith, Nancy Hartsock, Donna Haraway, Sandra Harding, Alison Wylie, Lynette Hunter and Patricia Hill Collins. Key concepts Generally, standpoint theory gives insight into specific circumstances only available to the members of a certain collective standpoint. According to Michael Ryan, \\"the idea of a collective standpoint does not imply an essential overarching characteristic but rather a sense of belonging to a group bounded by a shared experience.\\"Encyclopedia of Social Theory, 789. Kristina Rolin states that \\"the assumption of essentialism is that all women share the same socially grounded perspective in virtue of being women, the assumption of automatic epistemic privilege is that epistemic advantage accrues to the subordinate automatically, just in virtue of their occupying a particular social position.\\" According to this approach: * A standpoint is a place from which human beings view the world. * A standpoint influences how the people adopting it socially construct the world. * A standpoint is a mental position from which things are viewed. * A standpoint is a position from which objects or principles are viewed and according to which they are compared and judged. * The inequalities of different social groups create differences in their standpoints. * All standpoints are partial; so (for example) Standpoint feminism coexists with other standpoints. Applications Since standpoint theory focuses on marginalized populations, it is often applied within fields that focus on these populations. Standpoint has been referenced as a concept that should be acknowledged and understood in the Social Work field, especially when approaching and assisting clients.Swigonski, M. E. (1993). \\"Feminist Standpoint Theory and the Questions of Social Work Research\\". Affilia, 8(2), 171‚Äì183. Many marginalized populations rely on the welfare system to survive. Unfortunately, those who structure the welfare system typically have never needed to utilize its services before. Standpoint theory has been presented as a method to improving the welfare system by recognizing suggestions made by those within the welfare system. In Africa, standpoint theory has catalyzed a social movement where women are introduced to the radio in order to promote awareness of their experiences and hardships and to help these women heal and find closure. Another example dealing with Africa is slavery and how slavery differed greatly depending on if one was the slave or the master. If there were any power relationships there could never be a single perspective. No viewpoint could ever be complete, and there is no limit to anyone's perspective. Asante and Davis‚Äôs (1989) study of interracial encounters in the workplace found that because of different cultural perspectives, approaching organizational interactions with others with different beliefs, assumptions, and meanings often leads to miscommunication. Brenda Allen stated in her research that, \\"Organizational members' experiences, attitudes, and behaviors in the workplace are often influenced by race-ethnicity.\\"Allen, B. J. (1995). \\"'Diversity' and organizational communication\\". Journal of Applied Communication Research, 23, 145. Paul Adler and John Jermier suggest that management scholars should be aware of their standpoints. They write that those studying management should \\"consciously choose [their] standpoints and take responsibility for the impact (or lack of impact) of [their] scholarship on the world.\\"Adler, Paul, and John Jermier. 2005. \\"Developing a field with more soul: Standpoint theory and public policy research for management scholars\\". The Academy of Management Journal 48 (6): 942. Jermier argued that all parts of a research study- identifying the problem, theorizing research questions, gathering and analyzing data, drawing conclusions, and the knowledge produced are there to some extent because of the researcher‚Äôs standpoint. This caused him to question what standpoint to adopt in the management of scientists. To avoid falling into limitations of the status quo and certain standpoints, he said that \\"the view from below has greater potential to generate more complete and more objective knowledge claims.\\" He continues to say that, ‚Äúif our desire is to heal the world, we will learn more about how the root mechanisms of the world work and about how things can be changed by adopting the standpoints of those people and other parts of nature that most deeply suffer its wounds.‚ÄùJermier, J.M. 1998. \\"Critical perspectives on organizational control\\". Administrative Science Quarterly, 43: 235‚Äì256. Feminist standpoint theory Feminist standpoint theorists make three principal claims: (1) Knowledge is socially situated. (2) Marginalized groups are socially situated in ways that make it more possible for them to be aware of things and ask questions than it is for the non- marginalized. (3) Research, particularly that focused on power relations, should begin with the lives of the marginalized. Feminist standpoint theorists such as Dorothy Smith, Patricia Hill Collins, Nancy Hartsock, and Sandra Harding claimed that certain socio-political positions occupied by women (and by extension other groups who lack social and economic privilege) can become sites of epistemic privilege and thus productive starting points for inquiry into questions about not only those who are socially and politically marginalized, but also those who, by dint of social and political privilege, occupy the positions of oppressors. This claim was specifically generated by Sandra Harding and as such, \\"Starting off research from women's lives will generate less partial and distorted accounts not only of women's lives but also of men's lives and of the whole social order.\\"Griffin, E. M. (2009). A first look at communication theory (7th edn). New York, NY: McGraw-Hill. This practice is also quite evident when women enter into professions that are considered to be male oriented. Londa Schiebinger states, \\"While women now study at prestigious universities at about the same rate as men, they are rarely invited to join the faculty at top universities...The sociologist Harriet Zuckerman has observed that 'the more prestigious the institution, the longer women wait to be promoted.' Men, generally speaking, face no such trade-off.\\" Standpoint feminists have been concerned with these dualisms for two related reasons. First, dualisms usually imply a hierarchical relationship between the terms, elevating one and devaluing the other.West, R., and H. L. Turner (2004). Communication Theory. Analysis and Application. He also said that when we suggest that decisions should be made rationally, not emotionally, for example, we are showing that reason holds a higher value in our culture than does emotion. Also, related to this issue is the concern that these dualisms often become gendered in our culture. In this process, men are associated with one extreme and women with the other. In the case of reason and emotion, women are identified with emotion. Because our culture values emotion less than reason, women suffer from this association. Feminist critics are usually concerned with the fact that dualisms force false dichotomies (partition of a whole) onto women and men, failing to see that life is less either/or than both/and, as relational dialectics theory holds. Indigenous standpoint theory Indigenous standpoint theory within its entirety is an intricate theoretical approach in how the Indigenous navigate the difficulties of their experiences within spaces which contest their epistemology. More precisely, its utilisation stems from a diverse background of marginalised groups whose experiences were rejected and suppressed within an intellectual knowledge production. However, the analysis of these experiences is not the cycle of accumulation of stories, of lived experiences, and in turn, doesn‚Äôt produce limitless subjective narratives to obstruct objective knowledge. Indigenous standpoint, as well as feminist theory, expect the ‚Äúknower‚Äù to address their social status of privilege to those they are researching. When addressing ourselves as ‚Äòknowers‚Äô into the setting, the intention isn‚Äôt to realign the focus, however, to include the social relations within what we as ‚Äúknowers‚Äù know. This is a matter of respect as the researcher is expected to declare who they are and on what basis they write on. This ‚Äúself-awareness is fundamental to the research process because it should result in a researcher role that is respectful and not disruptive, aggressive or controlling‚Äù. An Indigenous ‚Äòknower‚Äô does not possess a predisposed ‚Äòreadymade critical stance‚Äô on the world, rather it presents questions required to answer before able to produce objective knowledge. Thus, this engagement enables us to create a critical Indigenous standpoint. This in itself doesn‚Äôt determine truth, however, produces a range potential argument with further possible answers. The arguments established, however, still, require its basis to be rational and reasonable and answer the logic and assumptions on which they were established. Thus, arguments cannot assert a claim of truth on an idea because they, the Indigenous individual, are a part of the Indigenous community as the theory wouldn‚Äôt allow to authorise themselves solely truthful on the basis of their experience. Indigenous standpoint theory is facilitated by three principles, defined by Martin Nakata. The first principle Nakata states ‚ÄúIt would, therefore, begin from the premise that my social position is discursively constituted within and constitutive of complex set of social relations as expressed through social organisation of my every day‚Äù. This denotes that one‚Äôs social position is established and acknowledgement of social relations within factors such as social, political, economic and cultural, impacts and influence who you are and structure your everyday life. The second principle Nakata states ‚ÄúThis experience as a push-pull between Indigenous and non-Indigenous positions; that is, the familiar confusion with constantly being asked at any one moment to both agree and disagree with any proposition on the basis of a constrained choice between a whitefella or blackfella perspective‚Äù. This signifies that the position of which Indigenous people hold at the cultural interface to decide a continuous stance is recognised. Instead, reorganisation for Indigenous agency should be constituted on what they know from this position. Simplistically stated, it is questioning why should Indigenous people have to choose positions instead of share what they know from both. The third and last principle Nakata states ‚Äúthe idea that the constant ‚Äòtensions‚Äô that this tug-of-war creates are physically experienced, and both inform as well as limit what can be said and what is to be left unsaid in every day.‚Äù Nakata here is describing the physical worlds of how Indigenous and non-Indigenous differ in everyday context, and how these differences can inform of limit has it might be unacceptable in western colonist society that would otherwise be acceptable with other Indigenous people. Nakata describes that these three principles allow him to forge a critical standpoint from the cultural interface and enable to create better arguments in relation to his position within epistemologies ad with other groups of ‚Äòknowers‚Äô. However, overturn a position he is dominant in because of his background due to the arguments being simplistic or misrepresented with no evidence to support itself. Thus, Indigenous standpoint theory can be defined as a ‚Äúmethod of inquiry, a process for making more intelligible ‚Äòthe corpus of objectified knowledge about us‚Äô as it emerges and organises understanding of ‚Ä¶ lived realities‚Äù. Criticisms Critics argue that standpoint theory, despite challenging essentialism, relies itself on essentialism, as it focuses on the dualism of subjectivity and objectivity. In regards to feminist standpoint theory: though it does dispel many false generalizations of women, it is argued that focus on social groups and social classes of women is still inherently essentialist. Generalizations across the entire female gender can be broken into smaller more specific groups pertaining to women's different social classes and cultures, but are still generalized as distinct groups, and thus marginalization still occurs. West and Turner stated that an author by the name of Catherine O'Leary (1997) argued that although standpoint theory has been helpful in reclaiming women's experiences as suitable research topics, it contains a problematic emphasis on the universality of this experience, at the expense of differences among women's experiences. Another main criticism of Harding and Wood's standpoint theory is the credibility of strong objectivity vs. subjectivity. Standpoint theorists argue that standpoints are relative and cannot be evaluated by any absolute criteria, but make the assumption that the oppressed are less biased or more impartial than the privileged. This leaves open the possibility of an overbalance of power, in which the oppressed group intentionally or unintentionally becomes the oppressor. Intentional overbalance of power, or revenge, can manifest as justification for extremism and militarism, which can sometimes be seen in more extreme forms of feminism. While the beginnings of standpoint theory are based on the critical paradigm from a Marxist view of social class oppression, a feminist philosophy developed in the 1970s and 1980s and the main focus has been on the feministic side. Other groups, as of now, need to be included into the theory and a new emphasis needs to be made toward other marginalized or muted groups. These groups envelop minorities, culturally different and the disabled or those that have a disability. When Harding and Wood conceived Standpoint theory they did not understand, when they defined it as a feminist view, that there are different cultures existing in the same social group. Many researchers are unsure of the idea of it having essentialism, as essentialism refers to the practice of generalizing all groups as though they were, in essence, the same.‚Äù Early standpoint theorists sought to understand the way in which the gendered identity of knowers affected their epistemic resources and capacities‚Äù. These other muted or marginalized groups have a more realistic approach to standpoint theory as they have different experiences than those that are in power and even within those muted groups differences defined by different cultures of people can have an altered standpoint. This view gives a basis that in part Standpoint Theory has a central principle of the inversion thesis and Joshua St. Pierre defined this as \\"the inversion thesis gives epistemic authority to those marginalized by systems of oppression insofar as these people are often better knowers than those who benefit from oppression. Put simply: social dispossession produces epistemic privilege.\\" Part of standpoint theory‚Äôs return to favor comes from a re-articulation of its methodology, aims, and limitations that directly answer the criticisms mentioned above. Wylie has perhaps provided the most succinct articulation of second-wave standpoint theory. For her, a standpoint does not mark out a clearly defined territory such as ‚Äúwomen‚Äù within which members have automatic privilege but is a rather a posture of epistemic engagement. Responding to the claim that the situated knowledge thesis reifies essentialism, Wylie thus argues that it is \\"an open (empirical) question whether such structures obtain in a given context, what form they take, and how they are internalized or embodied by individuals\\". Identities are complex and cannot be reduced to simple binaries. Likewise, she argues that the criticism of automatic privilege is falters insofar as a standpoint is never given, but is achieved.

He has been called \\"the Godfather of disco\\". Montana was inducted into the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum in 2016. Life and career Montana was born in South Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and grew up in an Italian-American neighborhood. He began playing drums as a child and soon took up other percussion instruments, including the glockenspiel and marimba. By the late 1940s, he regularly played in nightclubs with jazz musicians such as Charlie Parker, Sarah Vaughan, Clifford Brown and Red Garland. He then spent time as a musician in Las Vegas hotels, accompanying and arranging for Harry Belafonte, Louis Prima and others. He returned to Philadelphia in the late 1950s, playing vibraphone on Frankie Avalon's 1959 hit \\"Venus\\", as well as recordings by Chubby Checker, Bobby Rydell and others. Around the same time, he started to be featured regularly on the nationally syndicated TV talk show, The Mike Douglas Show. He helped to set up Sigma Sound Studios, owned by Joe Tarsia in Philadelphia in 1967 and began working there with record producers Kenny Gamble, Leon Huff and Thom Bell. He was a founding member of MFSB and recorded several albums with the orchestra, including the international hit track, \\"TSOP (The Sound of Philadelphia)\\", a Grammy Award winner released in 1973. He played on and arranged many tracks by The Intruders, The Delfonics, The Spinners, Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes, The O'Jays, The Trammps, Eddie Kendricks, William DeVaughn, Billy Paul, Lou Rawls, The Stylistics, Teddy Pendergrass, and many others. However, he fell out with Gamble and Huff over financial issues and in 1974, after being introduced by Joe Bataan, joined with the Cayre brothers - Cayre brothers, Kenneth, Stanley, and Joseph - owners of Caytronics, a New York-based distributor of Latin music - to set up the Salsoul label. Several of the Philadelphia musicians, including Norman Harris, Ronnie Baker and Earl Young, left MFSB to join him for sessions and production work. Montana established The Salsoul Orchestra and their first record for the label, \\"Salsoul Hustle\\" was a commercial success. The orchestra recorded six albums for the label over the next three years, including a 'gold' Christmas album, with Montana producing, arranging and conducting most tracks. Ken Cayre praised Montana's skill at scoring strings, brass and diverse percussion in such a way that it all worked within a dance recording. The Salsoul Orchestra has been credited as \\"the first disco orchestra\\". Montana also worked at Salsoul with other musicians and singers, including First Choice and Loleatta Holloway. His most notable solos include \\"Runaway\\" by The Salsoul Orchestra featuring Loleatta Holloway, \\"Be Thankful For What You Got\\" by William DeVaughn and \\"I'm In Heaven\\" by Touch of Class. Montana left Salsoul in 1978 to join Atlantic Records for several albums before launching his own Philly Sound Works label. His recording of \\"Heavy Vibes\\", a reworking of part of MFSB's \\"Love Is the Message\\" credited to the Montana Sextet, reached #59 on the UK singles chart in 1983. In later years, Montana worked with house music duo Masters at Work, which rekindled interest in his work. Most recently, Montana worked on \\"New York City Boy\\" by the Pet Shop Boys. He died at Cherry Hill, New Jersey, on April 13, 2013, at the age of 85. Discography VINCENT MONTANA JR.

For example, observers often fail to notice major differences introduced into an image while it flickers off and on again. People's poor ability to detect changes has been argued to reflect fundamental limitations of human attention. Change blindness has become a highly researched topic and some have argued that it may have important practical implications in areas such as eyewitness testimony and distractions while driving. History =Early anecdotal observations= Outside of the domain of psychology, phenomena related to change blindness have been discussed since the 19th century. When film editing was introduced in movies, editors began to notice that changes to the background were not noticed by those watching the film. Going back earlier, William James (1842‚Äì1910) was the first to mention the lack of ability to detect change in his book Principles of Psychology (1890). =Earliest experimental reports= Research on change blindness developed from investigation in other phenomena such as eye movements and working memory. Although individuals have a very good memory as to whether or not they have seen an image, they are generally poor at recalling the smaller details in that image. When we are visually stimulated with a complex picture, it is more likely that individuals retain only a gist of an image and not the image in its entirety. The laboratory study of change blindness began in the 1970s within the context of eye movement research. McConkie conducted the first studies on change blindness involving changes in words and texts; in these studies, the changes were introduced while the observer performed a saccadic eye movement. Observers often failed to notice these changes.McConkie, G.W., & Rayner, K. (1976). Identifying the span of the effective stimulus in reading: Literature review and theories of reading. In H. Singer & R.B. Ruddell (Eds), Theoretical models and processes of reading (2nd ed., pp. 137‚Äì162) In the late 1980s, the first clear experimental demonstration was published showing very poor change detection in complex displays over brief intervals without eye movements being involved. Pashler (1988) showed that observers were poor at detecting changes introduced into arrays of letters while the display was flickered off and on, even if the offset was as brief as 67 milliseconds (although offsets briefer than that produced much more effective change detection). Pashler concluded by noting how odd it was that people generally report having a \\"clear sense of apprehending the identities and locations of large numbers of objects in a scene\\" (p. 377), and that given this introspective sense, it seemed quite surprising how poor is their detection of changes. =Research in the 1990s and 2000s= Saccadic eye movements have been known to induce change blindness With the rise of the ability to present complex, real-world images on a computer screen, Dr. George McConkie, in the early 1990s, as part of the new initiatives of the new Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, began a renewed attempt to investigate why the world looked stable and continuous despite the shifting retinal input signal that accompanied each saccade. This research began when John Grimes and Dr. George McConkie (1996) began to use actual photographs to study visual stability. This development in change blindness research was able to show the effects of change blindness in more realistic settings. Additionally, further research stated that rather large changes will not be detected when they occur during saccadic movements of the eye. In the first experiment of this kind, in 1995, Blackmore et al. forced saccades by moving the image and making a change in the scene at the same time. Observers' ability to detect the changes fell to chance. The effect was stronger using this method than when using brief grey flashes between images, although subsequent research has mostly used grey flashes or masking stimuli. Another finding based on similar studies stated that a change was easily picked up on by participants when the eye was fixated on the point of change. Therefore, the eye must be directly fixated on the area of change for it to be noticed. This was called the saccade target theory of transsaccadic memory of visual stability. However, other research in the mid-1990s has indicated that individuals still have difficulty detecting change even when they are directly fixated on a particular scene. A study by Rensink, O'Regan, & Clarke demonstrated that change blindness can have an effect even if the eye was fixated on a scene. In this study, a picture was presented followed by a blank screen or ‚Äúmasking‚Äù stimulus, which was followed by the initial picture with a change. The masking stimulus almost acts like a saccadic movement of the eye which makes it significantly more difficult for individuals to detect the change. This was a critical contribution to change blindness research because it demonstrated that a change can remain unnoticed with the smallest disruptions. Research on change blindness proceeded one step further into practical applications of this phenomenon. For example, there does not have to be a masking stimulus in order for individuals to miss a change in a scene. Individuals often take significantly longer to notice certain changes if there are a few small, high contrast shapes that are temporarily splattered over a picture. This method for testing change blindness is called ‚Äúmudsplashes‚Äù. This method is particularly relevant to individuals driving in a car when there is a visual obstruction on the windshield. This obstruction may impair an individual's ability to detect a change in their environment which could result in severe negative consequences while driving. Current research (2010 ‚Äì ) =Change detection= Research indicates that detecting changes in a change blindness task is easier when items are holistically processed, such as faces. Individuals notice a change faster when required to detect changes in facial features than when required to detect changes in images of houses. However, individuals are better at identifying the nature of the change in houses. Other researchers have discovered that mental processing in change blindness begins even before the change is presented. More specifically, there is increased brain activity in the parietal-occipital and occipital regions prior to the emergence of a change in a change blindness task. Researchers have also indicated there is a difference in brain activity between detecting a change and identifying change in an image. Detecting a change is associated with a higher ERP (Event-related potential) whereas identifying change is associated with an increased ERP before and after the change was presented. Additional research using fluctuations in ERPs has observed that changes in pictures (change blindness) are represented in the brain, even without the perceiver's conscious awareness of the change. Change blindness can be effectively used in the process of visualizing actual changes detected in 3D scenes. With appropriate techniques it is possible to enhance the perception of the portion of a 3D scene that is changed while hiding non significant, but otherwise still visible, changes. =Lucid dreaming= Lucid dreaming occurs when one realizes that the events experienced within a dream are bizarre or would not occur in one's waking life. As such, the inability to notice the bizarre nature of the dream has been coined as an example of change blindness, also known as individuals who are non-lucid dreamers. However, a recent study found that lucid dreamers did not perform better on a change blindness task than non-lucid dreamers. Therefore, the relation between lucid dreamers and change blindness has been discredited to some degree. =In teams= Another interesting area of research is the decreased susceptibility to change blindness when individuals are placed in teams. Although change blindness is still observed within teams, research has indicated that changes between images are noticed more when individuals work in teams as opposed to individually. Both teamwork and communication assist teams in correctly identifying changes between images. =Expertise= Another recent study looked at the relation between expertise and change blindness. Physics experts were more likely to notice a change between two physics problems than novices. It is hypothesized that experts are better at analyzing problems on a deeper level whereas novices employ a surface-level analysis. This research suggests that observing the phenomenon of change blindness may be conditional upon the context of the task. =Choice blindness= Cognitive psychologists expanded the study of Change Blindness into decision-making. In one study, they showed participants ten pairs of faces and asked them to choose which face was more attractive. For some pairs, the experimenter used sleight of hand to show participants a face they had not chosen. Only 26% of subjects noticed the mismatch between their choice of face and the different face they were shown instead. The experimenters tested pairs of faces that were either high in similarity or low in similarity, but the detection rate was no different between those conditions. Subjects were also asked to give reasons why they had chosen a face (although due to the sleight of hand they actually hadn't chosen it). Despite the mismatch, subjects gave responses that were comparable in emotionality, specificity, and certainty for faces they had or had not actually chosen. Further research has shown that the failure to detect mismatches between intention and outcome exists in consumer product choices and in political attitudes. =Counteraction= Prior research in the early part of the decade had shown that change blindness can be counteracted by a number of methods. Shifting attention with a visual cue can help lower the negative effects of change blindness. Stimulation of the superior colliculus improves performance and reaction time in the same way. However, recent research has also been done on countering tactile change blindness. A 2016 study by Riggs et al. shows that three successful methods for limiting tactile change blindness in distinguishing changes in vibration patterns are attention guidance, signal gradation and direct comparison. All three methods seek to bring attention to the area of change. Attention guidance works proactively by increasing the frequency of a cue. The second and third methods are reactive and based on error-feedback. Signal gradation further increases the intensity of the vibration after the change has been missed. Direct comparison pairs the pre-change and post-change vibration intensities without a gap in between after a change has been missed to support the use of relative judgment rather than absolute. While all significantly improve performance, the second and third countermeasures are most effective. Concentration and attention are also a major factors in avoiding change blindness. = Non-humans = Though comparatively little research has been done on change blindness in other animals, a few species of animals exhibited the same effects of change blindness as humans. Using the same motion detection paradigm for monkeys as humans, researchers found the results were the same in showing change blindness in motion. Pigeons not only demonstrate change blindness, but also are influenced by the salience and timing of the change in scenery like humans. Chimpanzees similarly have difficulty with detecting change in flicker-type visual search after a blank display was shown. Positional switches of a stimulus are the most difficult for chimpanzees to detect. The results show that the same levels of attention is demanded for chimpanzees as humans in these tasks. Change detection methods = Saccade forcing paradigm = This method was used in the first, 1995, experiment. A change is made in an image at the same time as the image is moved in an unpredictable direction, forcing a saccade. This method mimics eye movements and can detect change blindness without introducing blank screens, masking stimuli or mudsplashes. However, it is unclear if small additions to an image will predict if people will be unable to notice larger changes in an image to the same position to their eye. =Flicker paradigm= In this paradigm, an image and an altered image are switched back and forth with a blank screen in the middle. This procedure is performed at a very high rate and observers are instructed to click a button as soon as they see the difference between the two images. This method of studying change blindness has helped researchers discover two very important findings. The first finding is that it usually takes a while for individuals to notice a change even though they are being instructed to search for a change. In some cases, it can even take individuals over one minute of constant flickers to determine the location of the change. The second important finding is that changes towards the middle of a picture are noticed at a faster rate than changes on the side of a picture. Although the flicker paradigm was first used in the late 1990s, it is still commonly used in current research on change blindness and has contributed to current knowledge on change blindness. =Forced choice detection paradigm= Individuals who are tested under the forced choice paradigm are only allowed to view the two pictures once before they make a choice.Simons, Daniel J.; Levin, Daniel T.. In Cognitive vision, edited by Irwin, David E., Ross, Brian H., 295-322. San Diego, CA, US:Academic Press, 2003 Both images are also shown for the same amount of time. The flicker paradigm and the forced choice detection paradigm are known as intentional change detection tasks, which means that the participants know they are trying to detect change. These studies have shown that even while participants are focusing their attention and searching for a change, the change may remain unnoticed. =Mudsplashes= Mudsplashes are small, high contrast shapes that are scattered over an image, but do not cover the area of the picture in which the change occurs. This mudsplash effect prevents individuals from noticing the change between the two pictures. A practical application of this paradigm is that dangerous stimuli in a scene may not be noticed if there are slight obstructions in an individual's visual field. Previously, it has been stated that humans hold a very good internal representation of visual stimuli. Studies involving mudsplashes have shown that change blindness may occur because our internal representations of visual stimuli may be much worse than previous studies have shown. Mudsplashes have not been used as frequently as the flicker or forced choice detection paradigms in change blindness research, but have yielded many significant and groundbreaking results. =Foreground-background segregation= The foreground-background segregation method for studying change blindness uses photographs of scenery with a distinct foreground and background. Researchers using this paradigm have found that individuals are usually able to recognize relatively small changes in the foreground of an image. In addition, large changes to the colour of the background take significantly longer to detect. This paradigm is critical to change blindness research because many previous studies have not examined the location of changes in the visual field. Neuroanatomy =Neuroimaging= MRI image Various studies have used MRIs (magnetic resonance imaging) to measure brain activity when individuals detect (or fail to detect) a change in the environment. When individuals detect a change, the neural networks of the parietal and right dorsolateral prefrontal lobe regions are strongly activated. If individuals were instructed to detect changes in faces, the fusiform face area was also significantly activated. In addition, other structures such as the pulvinar, cerebellum, and inferior temporal gyrus also showed an increase in activation when individuals reported a change. It has been proposed that the parietal and frontal cortex along with the cerebellum and pulvinar might be used to direct an organism's attention to a change in the environment. A decrease of activation in these brain areas was observed if a change was not detected by the organism. Furthermore, the neurological activation of these highlighted brain areas was correlated with an individual's conscious awareness of change and not the physical change itself. Other studies using fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) scanners have shown that when change is not consciously detected, there was a significant decrease in the dorsolateral prefrontal and parietal lobe regions. These results further the importance of the dorsolateral prefrontal and parietal cortex in the detection of visual change. In addition to fMRI studies, recent research has used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in order to inhibit areas of the brain while participants were instructed to try to detect the change between two images. The results show that when the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) is inhibited, individuals are significantly slower at detecting change. The PPC is critical for encoding and maintaining visual images in short term working memory, which demonstrates the importance of the PPC in terms of detecting changes between images. For a change to be detected, the information of the first picture needs to be held in working memory and compared to the second picture. If the PPC is inhibited, the area of the brain responsible for encoding visual images will not function properly. The information will not be encoded and will not be held in working memory and compared to the second picture, thus inducing change blindness. =Role of attention= The role of attention is critical for an organism's ability to detect change. In order for an organism to detect change, visual stimulation must enter through eye and proceed through the visual stream in the brain. A study in 2004 demonstrated that if the superior colliculus (responsible for eye movements) of a monkey's brain is electrically stimulated, there would be a significant decrease in reaction time to detect the change. Therefore, it is critical for organisms to attend to the change in order for it to be detected. Organisms are only able to detect this change once the visual stimulation comes through the eye (its movements are controlled by the superior colliculus) and is subsequently processed through the visual stream. Influencing factors =Age= Older individuals have been known to have more difficulty detecting changes Age has been implicated as one of the factors which modulates the severity of change blindness. In a study conducted by Veiel et al. it was found that older individuals were slower to detect the changes in a change blindness experiment than were younger individuals. This trend was also noticed by Caird et al., who found that drivers aged 65 and older were more prone to making incorrect decisions after a change blindness paradigm was used at an intersection, than were participants aged 18‚Äì64. Age differences in change detection become most pronounced when the task is easier. While the actual shift in ability does not occur until at least age 65, people's confidence in their ability to detect change drops significantly at middle-age. Children from 6‚Äì13 years old looked at colored pictures of real world scenes that were manipulated by color, location of objects, or the removal of objects, in the central or peripheral focus of the image. Adults are more accurate when noticing the changes that occur in the picture. Children can accurately detect central changes, but aren't as good at detecting peripheral changes, and their accuracy depends on the type of manipulation. Younger drivers (average of 22 years old) were compared with older drivers (average of 69 years old). Images were presented on a screen showing various driving situations that included an original image and a modified image, and participants had to identify where a change had occurred in the modified version, if any. Older drivers expressed reduced accuracy, higher reaction times, and more false positive responses compared to younger drivers. =Attention= Attention is another factor that has been implicated in change blindness. Increasing shifts in attention decrease the severity of change blindness and changes in the foreground are detected more readily than changes made to the background of an image, an effect of the intentional bias for foreground elements. Community volunteers had to focus on a screen and accurately identify if there was a change between series of dots after being fixated on a point in the center of the screen. Distraction of attention by visual disruptions and the observers' ability to focus on potential change were found to have an effect on attention with change blindness. =Object presentation= Object presentation is the way in which objects appear and is a factor that determines the occurrence of change blindness. Change blindness can occur even without a delay between the original image and the altered image, but only if the change in the image forces the viewer to redefine the objects in the image. Additionally, the appearance of a new object is more resistant to change blindness than a looming object, and both the appearance of a new object and the looming of an object are more resistant to change blindness than the receding of an object. Furthermore, the appearance or onset of an object is more resistant to the occurrence of change blindness than the disappearance or offset of an object. =Substance use= Substance use has been found to affect the detection biases on change detection tasks. If an individual was presented with two changes simultaneously, those that had a change related to the substance they use regularly reported using the substance more than those detecting the neutral stimuli. This indicates a relationship between substance use and change detection within a change blindness paradigm. This bias for devoting more attention to the drug-relevant stimuli is also observed with problem drinkers. Individuals who have a more severe drinking problem are quicker to detect changes in alcohol-related stimuli than in neutral stimuli. Alcohol can sometimes improve change blindness. For example, intoxicated participants were quicker at detecting minor changes in large displays of images than sober participants. This could be attributed to more passive viewings of larger images, and the use of alcohol slows down more controlled search processes. Active viewing involves more saccades than fixations. When viewing an image with a more passive search, more information is processed with each fixation. The alcohol slows down the movement and processing of the brain, therefore causing more fixation points. In other senses In addition to change blindness induced by changes in visual images, change blindness also exists for the other senses: *Change deafness ‚Äì Change deafness is the concept of change blindness for auditory information. In his experiment, Vitevitch (2003) used a speech shadowing task to demonstrate change deafness. He presented a list of words to participants and had them simultaneously repeat the words they heard. Halfway through the list, either the same or a different speaker presented the second half of the words to participants. At least 40% of participants failed to detect the change in speaker when it occurred. Fenn et al. called participants on the phone and replaced the speaker in the middle of the conversation. Participants rarely noticed change. However, when explicitly monitoring for change, the participants' detection increased. Neuhoff et al. (2015) expanded on the idea of change deafness, and identified a new phenomenon called \\"slow-change deafness\\" using a series of four experiments. In the first experiment, he had participants listen to continuous speech that changed three semitones in pitch over time. Fifty percent of participants failed to notice the change. In the second and third experiments, listeners were alerted to the possibility of a change. In these trials, detection rates drastically improved. In the fourth experiment, the magnitude of the change that occurred in the stimulus increased, causing the detection rates to increase. These experiments demonstrated that \\"slow-change deafness\\" depends on both the magnitude of a stimulus change and the listeners' expectations. *Olfactory ‚Äì Humans are constantly in a state of change blindness due to the poor spatial and temporal resolutions with which scents are detected. Although humans' odor detection thresholds are very low, our olfactory attention is only captured by unusually high odorant concentrations. Olfactory input is made up of a series of sniffs separated in time. The long inter-sniff-interval creates \\"change anosmia,\\" in which humans have trouble discerning smells that are not highly concentrated. This period of sensory habituation as well as very low concentrations of odorants regularly yield no subjective experience. This behavior is called \\"experiential nothingness\\". *Somatosensory ‚Äì Somatosensory change blindness for tactile stimuli has been observed, and reveals important information about the distinction from visual change blindness. Auvray et al. (2008) did an experiment on the ability to detect change between two patterns of tactile stimuli presented to fingertips. The experiments presented consecutive patterns which were separated by an empty interval, or by a tactile, visual, or auditory mask. Results showed that performance was impaired when the empty interval was inserted, and even more so when tactile mask was introduced. Changes in tactile displays composed of two or three stimuli with only one distractor in between go unnoticed, while several distractors are needed for visual displays to go unnoticed. These experiments have shown us that our ability to monitor tactile information is affected by more severe limitations than the same ability within the visual modality. Practical implications The phenomenon of change blindness has practical implications in the following areas: =Eyewitness testimony= Research in change blindness has uncovered the possibility of inaccuracy in eyewitness testimony. In many cases, witnesses are rarely able to detect a change in the criminal's identity unless first intending to remember the incident in question. This inability to detect a change in identity can lead to inaccuracy in identifying criminals, mistaken eyewitness identification, and wrongful conviction. Therefore, eyewitness testimonies should be handled with caution in court in order to avoid any of these negative consequences. =Driving ability= Traffic collision Older drivers make more incorrect decisions than younger drivers when faced with a change in the scene at an intersection. This can be attributed to the fact that older individuals notice change at a slower rate compared to younger individuals. In addition, the location and relevance of changes have an effect on what is noticed while driving. The reaction time to changes in the driver's peripherals is much slower than the reaction time to changes that occur towards the center of the driver's visual field. Furthermore, drivers are also able to recognize more relevant changes as opposed to irrelevant ones. Research on the effects of change blindness while driving could provide insight into potential explanations of why car accidents occur. =Military= Military command and control personnel who monitor multiple displays have a delayed time to accurately identify changes due to the necessity of verifying the changes, as well as the effective 'guessing' on some trials. Due to the fact that control personnel have delayed reaction because of change blindness, an interface design of computer work stations may be extremely beneficial to improve the reaction time and accuracy. Blindness Change blindness is defined as a misplaced confidence in one's ability to correctly identify visual changes.Baddeley, A., Eysenck, M.W., & Anderson, M.C. (2009). Memory. London: Psychology Press. People are fairly confident in their ability to detect a change, but most people exhibit poor performance on a change blindness task. =Factors= * Perceived Success ‚Äì A higher perception of success from previous experience inflates the individual's confidence for success in future experiences. * Search Time ‚Äì A longer time spent looking for the visual change creates the impression of poor performance on the task. In other words, a shorter time in identifying a visual change creates the impression of good performance and thus the individual will be overconfident in this ability. =Spotlight effect= The spotlight effect is a social phenomenon that is defined as an overestimation of the ability of others to notice us. A seemingly obvious change such as another individual changing a sweater during a memory task is rarely noticed. However, the individuals switching the sweater tend to overestimate the ability of the test writers to notice the change in sweaters. In the spotlight effect, this poor performance is a result of the overestimation of others' ability to notice us whereas in change blindness it is the overestimation of others' ability to notice the sweater change. In other words, it is the distinction between noticing differences on a person and noticing differences between any images.

In recent years, Philips had extended the Philishave brand to include hair clippers, beard trimmers and beard shapers. Philips used the Philishave brand name for their shavers from 1939 to 2006.https://shaverguru.com/philips-shavers/ The Philishave shaver was invented by Philips engineer Alexandre Horowitz, who used rotating cutters instead of the reciprocating cutters that had been used in previous electric shavers. The shaver was introduced in 1939, though initial production was limited due to the outbreak of World War II (the production facility in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, was overrun by the German Army in 1940). After the war, a slightly improved version of the cigar-shaped single-head shaver was introduced. A more ergonomic egg-shaped single-head model was introduced in 1948 and was designed by US industrial designer Raymond Loewy. Global sales increased markedly after a double-head model was introduced in 1951. In 1952, production of shavers shifted from Eindhoven to a new production facility in Drachten, the Netherlands. Philips currently has two production centres for shavers: Drachten and Zhuhai, China. A triple-head model was test marketed in Australia and New Zealand in 1956, but would not be introduced globally until 1966. In 1980, Philips introduced the Lift & Cut Philishave shaver with lifters which pull whiskers slightly before cutting, allowing for closer shaves. The brand name Philishave was phased out in 2006 so shavers now bear only the Philips name. Philips is now co-branding their shavers sold in the US as \\"Philips Norelco\\" in preparation of a phase-out of the Norelco name. Philips have celebrated their 80th anniversary in the electric shaver business by marketing special 'Heritage Edition' shaver models reviving the Philishave brand.https://www.usa.philips.com/c-p/S3552_89/shaver-heritage-edition-dry- electric-shaver/https://www.philips.co.uk/c-p/S3561_12/shaver-heritage- edition-wet-and-dry-electric-shaver Models and parts According to instructions supplied with the units, the shaving heads need cleaning every 2 months and replacing every 18 months. However, not all Philips spare parts will fit well on all Philips shavers. Heads are given an \\"HQ\\" number, such as HQ2, HQ3, HQ4, HQ5, etc., and this number should normally correspond with the first digit of the model number of the shaver. An exception is the 6000 series which takes HQ8 heads.Instruction leaflet for \\"6000 Series\\" (HQ6076, HQ6075, HQ6073, HQ6071, HQ6070) \\"HQ8 Precise Cutting System Shaving Heads\\" Although the heads do look much the same, attempts to fit the wrong HQ number may fail; for example, an HQ5 head will not correctly engage with the spindle on a shaver model designed for an HQ3 or HQ4 head, due to a small extra piece of plastic in the centre of the HQ5 drive socket. Care should therefore be taken when choosing replacement parts.

The first system, Hurricane One, was initially observed on August 27\\\\. The final storm, Tropical Storm Seven, transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on October 29\\\\. These dates fall within the period with the most tropical cyclone activity in the Atlantic. Every storm of the season except Tropical Storm Seven existed simultaneously with another tropical cyclone. Of the season's seven tropical cyclones, three reached hurricane status. Furthermore, two of those three strengthened into major hurricanes, which are Category 3 or higher on the modern-day Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale. The strongest cyclone of the season, the first hurricane, peaked at Category 4 strength with 145 mph (230 km/h) winds. Upon striking Texas shortly after peak intensity, it produced a devastating storm surge in the Galveston area, with devastated city and caused at least 8,000 fatalities. Nicknamed the \\"1900 Galveston hurricane\\", it remains the deadliest natural disaster in the history of the United States. The hurricane also caused about $31.35 million (1900 USD) in damage. Impact from other tropical cyclones was generally minor, though the remnants of Tropical Storm Five resulted in 1 death and at least $100,000 in damage in Atlantic Canada. __TOC__ Season summary ImageSize = width:800 height:200 PlotArea = top:10 bottom:80 right:20 left:20 Legend = columns:3 left:30 top:58 columnwidth:270 AlignBars = early DateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy Period = from:01/08/1900 till:01/12/1900 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal ScaleMinor = grid:black unit:month increment:1 start:01/08/1900 Colors = id:canvas value:gray(0.88) id:GP value:red id:TD value:rgb(0.38,0.73,1) legend:Tropical_Depression_=_‚â§39_mph_(‚â§62_km/h) id:TS value:rgb(0,0.98,0.96) legend:Tropical_Storm_=_39‚Äì73_mph_(63‚Äì117_km/h) id:C1 value:rgb(1,1,0.80) legend:Category_1_=_74‚Äì95_mph_(118‚Äì153_km/h) id:C2 value:rgb(1,0.91,0.46) legend:Category_2_=_96‚Äì110_mph_(154‚Äì177_km/h) id:C3 value:rgb(1,0.76,0.25) legend:Category_3_=_111‚Äì129_mph_(178‚Äì208_km/h) id:C4 value:rgb(1,0.56,0.13) legend:Category_4_=_130‚Äì156_mph_(209‚Äì251_km/h) id:C5 value:rgb(1,0.38,0.38) legend:Category_5_=_‚â•157_mph_(‚â•252_km/h) Backgroundcolors = canvas:canvas BarData = barset:Hurricane bar:Month PlotData= barset:Hurricane width:10 align:left fontsize:S shift:(4,-4) anchor:till from:27/08/1900 till:11/09/1900 color:C4 text:\\"One (C4)\\" from:07/09/1900 till:19/09/1900 color:C3 text:\\"Two (C3)\\" from:08/09/1900 till:23/09/1900 color:C2 text:\\"Three (C2)\\" from:11/09/1900 till:15/09/1900 color:TS text:\\"Four (TS)\\" from:04/10/1900 till:10/10/1900 color:TS text:\\"Five (TS)\\" from:10/10/1900 till:12/10/1900 color:TS text:\\"Six (TS)\\" from:24/10/1900 till:28/10/1900 color:TS text:\\"Seven (TS)\\" bar:Month width:15 align:center fontsize:S shift:(0,-20) anchor:middle color:canvas from:01/08/1900 till:01/09/1900 text:August from:01/09/1900 till:01/10/1900 text:September from:01/10/1900 till:01/11/1900 text:October from:01/11/1900 till:01/12/1900 text:November TextData = pos:(570,30) text:\\"(From the\\" pos:(617,30) text:\\"Saffir‚ÄìSimpson Hurricane Scale)\\" first hurricane of the season in Galveston, Texas Tropical cyclogenesis began with the development of the first hurricane on August 27 well west of Cape Verde. It was the strongest storm of the season, peaking as a Category 4 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 145 mph (230 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of . This was abnormally late, as the average date of development of the first tropical storm between 1944 and 1996 was July 11. In comparison, the latest date of the first tropical storm during the satellite era was Hurricane Anita on August 29, 1977. During the month of September, which is the climatological peak of hurricane season, three additional tropical cyclones formed, two of which were hurricanes. After the third hurricane dissipated on September 23, activity went dormant for nearly 2 weeks, until the fifth tropical storm formed near the Lesser Antilles on October 4. As it was becoming extratropical, a sixth tropical cyclone developed in the Bay of Campeche on October 10\\\\. The final system formed in the eastern Caribbean Sea, crossed Hispaniola, and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone between Bermuda and the East Coast of the United States on October 28\\\\. By far, the storm that caused the most devastation was Hurricane One, nicknamed the \\"Galveston hurricane\\". Its storm surge submerged much of Galveston Island in Texas, killing between 6,000 and 12,000 people. Official estimates put the death toll at approximately 8,000. As a result, it is currently the deadliest natural disaster in the history of the United States. At the time, it was also the second deadliest tropical cyclone in the Atlantic basin, behind only the Great Hurricane of 1780, which killed at least 22,000 people in the Lesser Antilles. However, the Galveston hurricane was surpassed in 1998 by Hurricane Mitch, which caused more than 11,000 fatalities in Central America. The storm was also among the deadliest in Canada, where at least 102 people were killed. Few other tropical cyclones during the 1900 Atlantic hurricane season caused any damage or fatalities. However, the extratropical remnants of Tropical Storm Five brought moderate damage to Canada. The storm caused 1 fatality and about $100,000 in losses, mainly to railroads. The season's activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 81. ACE is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs. It is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 34 knots (39 mph, 63 km/h) or tropical storm strength. Systems =Hurricane One= The Great Galveston Hurricane of 1900 Early on August 27, a ship encountered the first tropical storm of the season, while located about east of the southernmost islands of Cape Verde. It slowly strengthened while moving steadily west-northwestward and entered the northeastern Caribbean Sea on August 30\\\\. The storm moved south of Puerto Rico and made landfall in Dominican Republic as a weak tropical storm on September 2\\\\. It weakened slightly while crossing Hispaniola, before re-emerging into the Caribbean Sea later that day. On September 3, the cyclone struck modern day Santiago de Cuba Province and then slowly drifted along the southern coast of Cuba. Upon reaching the Gulf of Mexico on September 6, the storm strengthened into a hurricane, while situated near Dry Tortugas. Significant intensification followed and the system peaked as a Category 4 hurricane with winds of 145 mph (230 km/h) on September 8\\\\. Early on the next day, it made landfall near modern-day Jamaica Beach, Texas with winds of 140 mph (220 km/h). Around that time, its minimum barometric pressure of was observed. It weakened quickly after moving inland and fell to tropical storm intensity late on September 9\\\\. The storm turned east- northeastward and became extratropical over Iowa on September 11\\\\. The extratropical system strengthened while accelerating across the Midwestern United States, Ontario, Quebec, northern New England, and then New Brunswick before reaching the Gulf of Saint Lawrence on September 13\\\\. Later that day, the extratropical remnants struck Newfoundland. It then reached the far North Atlantic Ocean and began to weaken, finally dissipating near Iceland on September 15\\\\. The storm brought heavy rainfall to Cuba, with up to in a 24‚Äëhour period in the city of Santiago de Cuba. Much of Florida experienced tropical storm force winds, though no damage occurred. In Texas, strong winds were reported in the Galveston area, reaching . Storm surges between inundated the entire Galveston Island. Every house sustained damage, with at least 3,636 destroyed. In Galveston alone, approximately 10,000 were left homeless, out of a total population of 37,000. The actual death toll is unknown, though it is thought to be at least 8,000. Thus, the 1900 Galveston hurricane was the deadliest natural disaster in the history of the United States. Property damage from the storm was estimated at $30 million. Hurricane-force winds and storm surge inundated portions of southern Louisiana, though no significant damage or fatalities were reported. Further north, the storm and its remnants continued to produce heavy rains gusty winds, which downed telegraph wires in Illinois, Kentucky, New York, Michigan, and Ohio. Another fatality occurred in New York City when gusty winds knocked over a sign and struck a 23-year-old man. The remnants brought severe impact to Canada. In the province of Ontario, losses reached about $1.35 million, with $1 million to crops. There were at least 107 deaths in Canada, mostly due to sunken vessels near Newfoundland and the French territory of Saint-Pierre. =Hurricane Two= A ship reported strong gales in the vicinity of Cape Verde on September 7. Thus, HURDAT indicates that the second tropical storm of the season formed early on September 7, while located about west of the southernmost islands of Cape Verde. It quickly strengthened to a strong tropical storm on September 8, but then maintained that intensity for nearly 5 days. The system was not tracked until being encountered by the steamship Hungaria on September 13, at which time it was already a hurricane. Originally, the system was listed as Hurricane Four, it was operationally believed to have developed after the next two tropical cyclones. Later on September 14, it strengthened further into a Category 2 hurricane while moving northwestward. Re-curving northward, the system intensified into a Category 3 hurricane on September 16\\\\. At 1800 UTC, the hurricane peaked with maximum sustained winds of 120 mph (195 km/h). However, it weakened to a Category 2 hurricane later on September 17\\\\. Shortly thereafter, the storm bypassed southeast of Bermuda, bring gusty winds but little impact. It then re-curved northeastward. The system weakened back to a Category 1 hurricane on September 18\\\\. Later that day, it weakened to a tropical storm and then to a tropical depression early on September 19\\\\. The storm persisted for several more hours, until dissipated about southeast of Cape Race, Newfoundland. =Hurricane Three= Ship reports indicates that a tropical storm developed on September 8 at 1200 UTC, while located about 175 miles (280 km) east of the Bissagos Islands, Guinea-Bissau. The storm gradually strengthened as it was heading west-northward. By late on September 9, the system strengthened into a hurricane. It passed southwest of Cape Verde on the following day. The storm then intensified slowly, becoming a Category 2 hurricane early on September 12\\\\. Around that time, the hurricane peaked with maximum sustained winds of 100 mph (155 km/h). Later on September 12, it re- curved north-northwestward. After turning north-northeast, the storm began executing a small cyclonic loop on September 14\\\\. A weakening trend soon occurred, with it weakening to a Category 1 hurricane early on September 15\\\\. About four days later, the hurricane completed its cyclonic loop and then headed west-northwestward. The system weakened to a tropical storm early on September 20\\\\. During the next few days, the storm decelerated and turned westward. Late on September 22, it weakened to a tropical depression. The depression continued westward, until dissipating at 1800 UTC on September 23, while located about 745 miles (1,200 km) east-southeast of Bermuda. =Tropical Storm Four= Weather maps first indicated a tropical storm over the northwestern Caribbean Sea on September 11. Heading northwestward, the system brushed the Yucatan Peninsula as weak tropical storm. Late on September 11, it peaked with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (85 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of , while located in the southeastern Gulf of Mexico. Early on September 13, the storm re-curved northeastward and began weakening. At 0600 UTC on September 13, it made landfall near Venice, Louisiana at the same intensity. The storm weakened slightly and briefly moved offshore, before making another landfall near Ocean Springs, Mississippi with winds of 40 mph (65 km/h). Early on September 14, the storm weakened to a tropical depression. It weakened slowly while moving northeastward across the Deep South, before dissipating near Athens, Georgia on September 15\\\\. Operationally, it was considered the third tropical cyclone of the season. A telegraph from the Weather Bureau headquarters in Washington, D.C. warned vessels to remain in port for portions of the Gulf Coast of the United States. Strong gales were experienced along the coast from eastern Louisiana to western Florida and severely disrupted telegraph services in the region. The winds and tidal inundation exacerbated crop damage caused by an earlier storm along the Mississippi River in southeastern Louisiana. Growing rice was damaged in Cameron Parish but left unaffected in other parts of the state. The remnants brought heavy rains from Virginia to New England. Rough seas along the coast of New Jersey washed the schooner Willie ashore. =Tropical Storm Five= Observations from a ship indicate that the fifth tropical depression of the season developed at 0600 UTC on October 4, while located about northeast of Anguilla. Initially, the system remained weak and failed to strengthen into a tropical storm until October 7\\\\. It began to execute a cyclonic loop by early on the following day. Further intensification occurred and the storm peaked with winds of 70 mph (110 km/h) early on October 9\\\\. Eventually, it accelerated north-northeastward and became extratropical early on October 10\\\\. The remnants moved northward and eventually curved northeastward. Late on October 11, the extratropical remnants struck Nova Scotia. It continued rapidly across Atlantic Canada and re-emerged into the Atlantic. By October 14, the remnants dissipated near the southern tip of Greenland. The remnants of Tropical Storm Five brought severe impact to Canada. In Nova Scotia, 13 schooners were grounded, while 2 were destroyed. Strong winds downed telegraph wires in the eastern end of the province, while barns were de-roofed and trees were felled in Bayfield. High tides in New Brunswick inundated portions of Saint John, with some houses having up to of water. Other low-lying areas were flooded. Washouts disrupted the Canadian Pacific Railway service and swept away portions of the tracks. The cost to repairs the tracks was estimated at $100,000. There was also damage to highways and bridges. A child drowned after attempting to cross a swollen creek. On Prince Edward Island, winds damaged small buildings and knocked chimneys of some houses. Electrical wires were reported down in Charlottetown. =Tropical Storm Six= The sixth tropical storm of the season developed in the Bay of Campeche on October 10\\\\. Operationally, it was believed that the storm originated over eastern Cuba. Moving rapidly north-northeastward across the Gulf of Mexico, the storm peaked with maximum sustained winds of 45 mph (75 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of early on October 11\\\\. The storm re-curved east-northeastward and made landfall near modern-day Horseshoe Beach, Florida at the same intensity early on October 12\\\\. It emerged into the Atlantic Ocean late on October 12, shortly before becoming extratropical while located about east of Jekyll Island, Georgia. The remnants moved along the East Coast of the United States, striking the Outer Banks of North Carolina, Long Island in New York, and New England. It continued inland over Canada, until dissipating over Labrador on October 15\\\\. Impact from the storm was generally minor. Rainfall and gusty winds were reported between Florida and the Carolinas. Further north, it brought brisk to strong winds to New Jersey and southern New England. =Tropical Storm Seven= Telegraph reports indicate that a tropical depression developed in the eastern Caribbean Sea on October 24. The depression moved northwestward without differentiating in intensity before making landfall near San Crist√≥bal, Dominican Republic with winds of 35 mph (55 km/h). It did not weaken while crossing Hispaniola and instead strengthened into a tropical storm shortly after emerging into the Atlantic Ocean near the northwestern tip of Haiti. Late on October 27, the storm re- curved north-northeastward and pass through the eastern Bahamas. Around that time, it peaked with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (85 km/h). Early on October 28, the storm accelerated and re-curved slightly to the northeast. At 0000 UTC on October 29, it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while located about northwest of Bermuda. The extratropical remnants persisted until dissipating later on October 29\\\\. No impact was reported in either Dominican Republic or Haiti. Much of eastern Cuba reported light rains, particularly in the provinces of Camag√ºey and Santiago de Cuba. Strong winds were reported throughout the Bahamas, though no damage occurred. As far east as Jupiter, Florida, sustained winds reached .

Kelly of George G. Meade and the council of war at Gettysburg, July 2, 1863 Aleksey Kivshenko. The Fili council of war decides to abandon Moscow to Napoleon. A council of war is a term in military science that describes a meeting held to decide on a course of action, usually in the midst of a battle. Under normal circumstances, decisions are made by a commanding officer, optionally communicated and coordinated by staff officers, and then implemented by subordinate officers. Councils of war are typically held when matters of great importance must be decided, consensus must be reached with subordinates, or when the commanding officer is unsure of his position. The classic council of war includes a discussion and then a vote, often taken without the senior commander present to influence or intimidate the subordinates. The tradition in such meetings is that the officers vote in reverse sequence of their seniority, with the junior officers voting first. In civilian usage, council of war can describe any important meeting, such as in business, that must reach a decision under the pressure of adverse conditions. A variation on the traditional council of war is one in which the subordinates vote, but the results are considered merely advisory to the overall commander, who then makes a final decision. Such a meeting was held on July 2, 1863, during the Battle of Gettysburg, in which Major General George G. Meade, commanding the Union Army of the Potomac, convened his Corps commanders and staff to discuss whether they should withdraw from the battlefield or, if not, whether they should attack Robert E. Lee's Confederate army or await his attack. Historical evidence indicates that Meade had already determined to stay and await Lee's attack, which occurred on July 3, the disastrous attack known as Pickett's Charge. But Meade formed consensus in his staff and improved their confidence by encouraging a two-hour discussion and vote, which resulted in the outcome he was seeking.

Portrayed by Helen Wagner for 54 years from the soap's inception in 1956 until 2010, Nancy served as the core family's and, by extension, the town's matriarch. Wagner was acknowledged by the Guinness Book of Records as being the portrayer of the longest-running character portrayed by one actor on television,CNN.com: Fifty years on 'As the World Turns', 30 March 2006 and held the title until her death on May 1, 2010. Wagner spoke the first lines, \\"Good morning, dear,\\" on the series debut on April 2, 1956.The New York Times: , 3 May 2010 Throughout the course of the series, Nancy remained a matriarch figure in the lives of those she cared for. Over the course of the program, Nancy had appeared in some 19,700 scenes and has been described as a straitlaced, proper and unassuming woman who stood for \\"old- fashioned values\\". In 2004, Wagner received her first award for her work on the show in the form of a Lifetime Achievement Award at the Daytime Emmys after 48 years on the soap.International Movie Database: , November 20, 2011 Wagner died of cancer on May 1, 2010, and Nancy last appeared onscreen June 1, 2010. As the World Turns dedicated two episodes to both the character and actress with surrounding characters illustrating different ways of dealing with her death. Storylines She is one of the original characters of the long-running soap, and spoke the first line on the debut episode on April 2, 1956 (\\"Good morning dear, what would you like for breakfast?\\"). Show creator Irna Phillips modeled Nancy in the mold of a member of a Greek chorus: someone who stays mostly on the sidelines but nevertheless comments on the crises that more dynamic residents of the town faced. In many respects, Nancy's \\"moral voice\\" served to further how Phillips wanted certain characters to be perceived by the public. When Nancy spoke out against her son Bob's ex-wife Lisa in the mid-1960s, the Lisa character became, by and large, the character everyone \\"loved to hate.\\" Likewise, when Nancy forgave Lisa for her past transgressions in the 1970s, public opinion softened toward Lisa and she became a respected character on the program. Traditionally a housewife, Nancy was bit by the feminism bug in the late 1970s and worked for a time as a secretary. In the early 1980s, she quit that job and returned to keeping house. For several years she worked as a volunteer at Oakdale Memorial Hospital where her son, Bob, is Chief of Staff. In 1936, she married attorney Christopher Hughes, and they had four children (three of which were seen on the show; a daughter died while swimming in a pool during a thunderstorm before the series started). Chris died in 1986, shortly after he and Nancy celebrated their fiftieth wedding anniversary. After a considerable mourning period, she married Detective Dan McClosky (Chief of the Oakdale Police Department) in 1987. McClosky developed Alzheimer's disease in 1994 and died two years later. She later enjoyed the company of Joe D'Angelo, as the two developed a strong bond over their frustrations at being unable to help their respective offspring with their ongoing problems. Since McClosky's death, Nancy has lived with her son Dr. Bob Hughes and his wife, Kim, and has spent much of her time with her grandchildren. She is particularly close to her grandson Chris. Nancy was rarely seen in later years, averaging about three or four appearances a month when the storyline permitted. Unlike other soap actors who have advanced in years (such as Anna Lee and Frances Reid), Helen Wagner had relatively few health problems as she got older, and her lack of appearances on the series were almost solely due to limited storyline. The character made a long-awaited appearance at Tom and Margo's 25th Wedding Anniversary on July 2, 2008. Much of her screen time in 2006 finds the character \\"embroiled in a mystery surrounding the publication of a scandalous novel, Oakdale Confidential, which sheds light on the checkered pasts of several characters.\\" In 2009, Nancy was still active and worked as a volunteer at the hospital. On Thanksgiving 2009, she gives pieces of advice to Katie after the death of Brad. Nancy again showed up just after Christmas when she heard of Casey's upcoming marriage to Alison. She gave him the engagement ring that Chris gave her. When the engagement was broken off, the ring was returned to Nancy, but she insisted that Casey hang onto it. Nancy was on hand in 2010 to celebrate Bob and Kim's 25th wedding anniversary. Nancy and the rest of the family were all shocked to find out that they really weren't married. She helped Bob and Kim settle their recent differences and was delighted when Frannie returned to see them wed. (This scene is notable for a brief return to the show by Julianne Moore, who began her career playing the role of Frannie in the 1980s.https://ew.com/article/2010/03/01/julianne-moore-as-the-world- turns/) In Nancy's final appearances on the series, she is seen having breakfast with Casey and Alison, and then giving advice to Katie on coping with Brad's death. Nancy was quietly written out of the show by having her die in her sleep in her apartment and be found by her son Bob. Episodes that aired August 30 and August 31, 2010 dealt with her death, the former episode depicting news of the death and the latter serving as a memorial. Creation and casting =Characterization= left Wagner began portraying Nancy in the first episode in 1956. Six months on, producer Irna Phillips sacked Wagner due to her dissatisfaction with the way that she poured coffee ‚Äì an important task for a character who provided a sympathetic ear and a shoulder on which to cry.https://www.independent.co.uk: , May 22, 2010 The character was later reinstated. In a 1968 New York Times interview, Wagner called Nancy Hughes \\"a tentpole character.\\"https://www.usatoday.com: , May 2, 2010 \\"Nothing ever happens to Nancy,\\" Wagner said. \\"She's the one the others come and talk to.\\" However again in the 1980s, Wagner and on-screen husband Don MacLaughlin were relegated to recurring status by new producer, Mary-Ellis Bunim, who wanted to attract a younger audience. She voiced her displeasure at the situation in a 1981 Associated Press article, where she claimed she'd been given one line in three months worth of television.By Michael Kuchwara, Associated Press - April 28, 1981 \\"There just hasn't been anything to Nancy's character. Anybody could read the lines I've been given,\\" Wagner said. She and MacLaughlin returned as contract players in 1985. Wagner appeared on contract from April 2, 1956 to June 28, 1956; July 17, 1956 to April 1981, as recurring from April 1981 to March 1985, and again on contract from March 1985 until her death in the spring of 2010. Wagner highlighted in 1998 that the characters were now \\"destructive, mean, immoral, unattractive and selfish.\\" \\"They care about nothing but themselves ‚Äî me, me, me. That's a dead end.

Education Biggs was a student at the Horner Military School in Oxford from 1883-1887 before attending the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He was an end on North Carolina's first great football team in 1892. Biggs graduated summa cum laude from the University of North Carolina (UNC) in 1893 with a bachelor's degree in philosophy. He was a member of Zeta Psi fraternity as well as the scholastic honors fraternity, Phi Beta Kappa. Biggs studied law at University of North Carolina Law School from 1893‚Äì1894 and was admitted to the North Carolina bar in 1894. He began a law practice in his hometown of Oxford, while teaching simultaneously as a professor at UNC (1898‚Äì1900) and Trinity Law School (1911‚Äì1912), in Durham, NC. From 1894-1898, Biggs also served as an adjutant in the North Carolina state guard. Political and legal career Biggs was elected to serve two terms as the mayor of Oxford in 1897 and 1898. In 1899, he helped found the North Carolina Bar Association, which he served as its first Secretary- Treasurer, and later served as president (1914‚Äì1915).James Crawford Biggs PapersNCBA and NC State BarPresidents of the NC Bar Association He served as a member of the North Carolina House of Representatives from Durham County in 1905. He continued his ascendency in the North Carolina legal system, serving as a state supreme court reporter (1905‚Äì1907), and then as a judge of the Superior Court of North Carolina, from 1907‚Äì1911. He resigned from this position in 1911 in order to resume private law practice in Raleigh, NC. From 1917‚Äì1918, Biggs was given an opportunity to litigate on the federal level when he was chosen to be a special assistant to the U.S. Attorney General in charge of oil litigation against the Southern Pacific Railroad in California. President Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed Biggs Solicitor General in May 1933, at the start of the New Deal. Biggs was well out of his depth in his new position, and lost 10 of the 17 cases he argued in his first five months in office. By the end of his' first term, Justice Stone commented that \\"Biggs was not fit to argue a cow case before a justice of the peace, unless the cow was fatally sick.\\" According to former Solicitor General Seth Waxman, \\"[t]he Justices informally sent word to [President] Roosevelt that Biggs should not be permitted to argue any case the United States hoped to win. Attorney General Homer Cummings stepped in to ensure that important cases would be handled by attorneys outside the Solicitor General's office. Thus, even before the first New Deal case was argued in the Supreme Court, the Solicitor General‚Äîthe person whose principal responsibility it is to represent the interests of the United States‚Äîwas out. By the time a more capable successor took office, the New Deal was in deep legal trouble.\\" (Cummings and Assistant Solicitor General Angus D. MacLean argued the Gold Clause Cases, which eventually marked some of the first successes for New Deal economic policies.) Biggs resigned on March 14, 1935. His successor (and future Supreme Court Justice) Stanley Reed was named his replacement on March 18 and confirmed by the Senate on March 25. Reed immediately set about dismissing several cert petitions filed by the government (e.g., Belcher v. United States) because the cases were poorly postured to result in opinions upholding the New Deal. Biggs returned to private practice in Raleigh in March 1935. Soon afterward, the government called upon Biggs for his expertise to assist the attorney general in the Northern Pacific Land Grant Case. He also served as chairman on the North Carolina Board of Elections, trustee of the UNC Methodist Orphanage, and a member of the executive committee and counsel of the American Red Cross, 1933-1935. Family and death He was married to Margie Jordan for 53 years, with whom he had one daughter, Marjorie. James Biggs died on January 30, 1960, at his home in Raleigh, North Carolina.

It consisted of a series of lightly armoured compartments, extending laterally along a narrow belt that intersected the ship's waterline. In theory this belt would absorb the explosions from torpedoes, or any naval artillery shells that struck below the waterline, and thus minimize internal damage to the ship itself. Torpedo belts are also known as Side Protection Systems or SPS, or Torpedo Defense System or TDS. The problem Armoured warships (dreadnought battleships, armoured cruisers and later light and heavy cruisers) of the early 20th century carried their main protective armour above the waterline - the \\"main belt\\" - which was intended to stop flat-trajectory gunfire from piercing the hull. Below the belt, the armour generally tapered away, to reduce overall weight. This, however, makes a ship vulnerable to hits below the waterline from torpedoes and the occasional large-calibre shell. Extending the belt downwards is impractical, since this increases displacement and draft, reducing speed and seaworthiness. Solutions Another solution was needed. Originally, torpedo nets were tried. These were heavy metal mesh nets hung out on booms at some distance from the sides of ships to catch or detonate torpedoes short of the ship. These proved largely ineffective since they could only be deployed when ships were stationary, were useless against shell hits below the waterline, and were ineffective against mines. Some ships were fitted with underwater armor in vulnerable areas below the waterline. This stopped torpedoes from penetrating the ship, but the shock from an underwater explosion could cause damage to weapon mountings and sensitive machinery, along with violently stressing the ships' structure. The German Imperial High Seas Fleet introduced torpedo belts with the first modern armored cruiser SMS Bl√ºcher and the simultaneous battleships of the Nassau- class since 1908. It was the only fleet during the duration of the First World War to do so. =Anti-torpedo bulges= Armour and underwater protection of HMS King George V and Tirpitz The outbreak of World War I increased the urgency to devise an effective torpedo defense system (TDS), thus the British Director of Naval Construction introduced the anti-torpedo bulge. Originally retrofitted to older ships, this was soon added to ships already under construction. In 1915, the British s and in 1917 American s introduced anti- torpedo bulges. Most later capital ships would have at least one torpedo bulkhead inboard of the external hull plating along the area of the ship protected by the armour belt. Most Battleships built after World War I had sophisticated and complex side-protection systems, as illustrated by the cross sectional drawing of and . =Torpedo belts= It was not until 1922, in the wake of the Washington Naval Treaty that curtailed ship weights and with the introduction of the British s, that a true layered torpedo belt was introduced. The two Nelsons used a water-filled belt, which was written off in the tonnage limits, as water was not part of the calculations for allowed displacement. Over the next 20 years many innovative designs of TDS were tried by various nations. A warship can be seriously damaged underwater not only by torpedoes, but also by heavy naval artillery shells that plunge into the ocean very close to the targeted ship. Such shells which are usually armor-piercing shells (AP shells) can pass through a short stretch of water and strike the warship some distance below the waterline. In 1914 typical AP shells were expected to punch a hole in the exterior plate and detonate there with a destructive effect similar to a torpedo. However by the 1940s, advances in AP shell technology incorporated delayed fuses which give AP shells deep penetration capability before exploding; such AP shells will typically make a smaller hole than a torpedo in breaching a ship's hull, but detonating beyond the belt in the hull can cause splinter damage to machinery spaces and secondary magazines, which in turn compromises watertight integrity and encourages progressive flooding.http://www.navweaps.com/index_lundgren/Kirishima_Damage_Analysis.pdf To improve protection against both shells and torpedoes, an air space can be added between the torpedo belt and the hull to increase the buoyancy of the warship. Today After the end of World War II torpedo belts, much like many of the large warships they protected, were rendered obsolete by the widespread use of aircraft, and eventually‚Äîespecially in the late 60s and into the 70s‚Äîby the use of anti-ship missiles, and a new generation of \\"smart\\", deep-diving torpedoes (such as the Mark 48) which are designed to detonate under a ship's keel and break its back.

He is also Director for the Cities Research Programme at the International Growth Centre. He was educated at The Collegiate School in New York City before obtaining his A.B. in economics from Princeton University and his Ph.D. in economics from the University of Chicago. Glaeser joined the faculty of Harvard in 1992, where he is currently (as of January 2018) the Fred and Eleanor Glimp Professor at the Department of Economics. He previously served as the Director of the Taubman Center for State and Local Government and the Director of the Rappaport Institute for Greater Boston (both at the Kennedy School of Government). He is a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, and a contributing editor of City Journal. He was also an editor of the Quarterly Journal of Economics. Glaeser and John A. List were mentioned as reasons why the AEA committee began to award the Clark Medal annually in 2009. According to a review in The New York Times, his book titled Triumph of the City: How Our Greatest Invention Makes Us Richer, Smarter, Greener, Healthier, and Happier (2011) summarizes Glaeser's years of research into the role that cities play in fostering human achievement and \\"is at once polymathic and vibrant\\". Family background and influence Glaeser was born in Manhattan, New York to Ludwig Glaeser (1930-September 27, 2006) and Elizabeth Glaeser. His father was born in Berlin in 1930, lived in Berlin during World War II and moved to West Berlin in the 1950s. Ludwig Glaeser received a degree in architecture from the Darmstadt University of Technology and a Ph.D. in art history from the Free University of Berlin before joining the staff at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City in 1963. He would go on to be curator of the Department of Architecture and Design in 1969. Glaeser said, about his father, \\"His passion for cities and buildings nurtured my own\\". Glaeser described how his father supported new construction and change if it met aesthetic standards. According to Glaeser, his father also \\"disliked dreary postwar apartment buildings and detested ugly suburban communities\\", but Glaeser, himself found much to admire in sprawl in so far as it facilitates \\"the ability of people to live as they choose\\". Yet Glaeser's work also argues against local anti-density zoning laws and federal government policies that encourage sprawl, such as the mortgage tax deduction and federal highway programs. Glaeser's career was also reportedly influenced by his mother, Elizabeth Glaeser, who worked at Mobil Corporation as head of Capital Markets for 20 years before joining Deloitte & Touche as Director of the Corporate Risk Practice. She earned an M.B.A. degree when Edward was ten years old and occasionally brought him to her classes. He remembers her teaching him micro- economics lessons, such as marginal cost price theory. Glaeser admired many aspects of the work of Jane Jacobs; they both argue that \\"cities are good for the environment.\\" He disagreed with her on densification through height. He advocates for higher buildings in cities while Jacobs deplored the 1950s and 1960s public housing projects inspired by Le Corbusier. The austere, dehumanizing New York high rises eventually became the \\"projects\\" straying far from their original intent. She believed in preserving West Greenwich Village's smaller historical buildings for personal, economic and aesthetic reasons. Glaeser grew up in a high rise and believes that higher buildings provide more affordable housing. He calls for elimination or lessening of height limitation restrictions, preservationist statutes and other zoning laws. Writings Glaeser has published at a rate of almost five articles per year since 1992 in leading peer-reviewed academic economics journals, in addition to many books, other articles, blogs, and op-eds. Glaeser has made substantial contributions to the empirical study of urban economics. In particular, his work examining the historical evolution of economic hubs like Boston and New York City has had major influence on both economics and urban geography. Glaeser also has written on a variety of other topics, ranging from social economics to the economics of religion, from both contemporary and historical perspectives. His work has earned the admiration of a number of prominent economists. George Akerlof (2001 Economics Nobel Prize) praised Glaeser as a \\"genius\\", and Gary Becker (1992 Economics Nobel Prize) commented that before Glaeser \\"urban economics was dried up. No one had come up with some new ways to look at cities.\\" Despite the seeming disparateness of the topics he has examined, most of Glaeser's work can be said to apply economic theory (and especially price theory and game theory) to explain human economic and social behavior. Glaeser develops models using these tools and then evaluates them with real world data, so as to verify their applicability. A number of his papers in applied economics are co-written with his Harvard colleague, Andrei Shleifer. In 2006, Glaeser began writing a regular column for the New York Sun. He writes a monthly column for The Boston Globe. He blogs frequently for The New York Times at Economix, and he has written essays for The New Republic. Although his most recent book, Triumph of the City (2011), celebrates the city, he moved with his wife and children to the suburbs around 2006 because of \\"home interest deduction, highway infrastructure and local school systems\\". He explained that this move is further \\"evidence of how public policy stacks the deck against cities. [B]ecause of all the good that comes out of city life‚Äîboth personal and municipal‚Äîpeople should take a hard look at the policies that are driving residents into the suburbs. Contribution to urban economics and political economy Glaeser has published in leading economic journals on many topics in the field of urban economics. In early work, he found that over decades, industrial diversity contributes more to economic growth than specialization, which contrasts with work by other urban economists like Vernon Henderson of Brown University. He has published influential studies on inequality. His work with David Cutler of Harvard identified harmful effects of segregation on black youth in terms of wages, joblessness, education attainment, and likelihood of teen pregnancy. They found that the effect of segregation was so harmful to blacks that if black youth lived in perfectly integrated metropolitan areas, their success would be no different from white youth on three of four measures and only slightly different on the fourth. In 2000 Glaeser, Kahn and Rappaport challenged the 1960s urban land use theory that claimed the poor live disproportionately in cities because richer consumers who wanted more land chose to live in the suburbs where available land was less expensive. They found that the reasons for the higher rate of poverty in cities (17% in 1990) compared to suburbs (7.4%) in the United States were the accessibility of public transportation and pro-poor central cities' policies which encouraged more poor people to choose to move to and live in central cities. He reiterated this in an interview in 2011, \\"The fact that there is urban poverty is not something cities should be ashamed of. Because cities don't make people poor. Cities attract poor people. They attract poor people because they deliver things that people need most of all‚Äîeconomic opportunity.\\" Glaeser and Harvard economist Alberto Alesina compared public policies to reduce inequality and poverty in the United States with Europe (Alesina and Glaeser 2004). Differing attitudes towards those less fortunate partially explain differences in the redistribution of income from rich to poor. Sixty percent of Europeans and 29% of Americans believe that the poor are trapped in poverty. Only 30% of Americans believe that luck determines income compared with 60% of Europeans. Sixty percent of Americans believe the poor are lazy while only 24% of Europeans believe this to be true. But they conclude that racial diversity in the United States, with the dominant group being white and the poor mainly non-white, led to resistance to reduce inequality in the United States through redistribution. Surprisingly the United States political structures are centuries old and remain much more conservative than their European counterparts as the latter have undergone much political change. He has also made important contributions in the field of social capital by identifying underlying economic incentives for social association and volunteering. For example, he and colleague Denise DiPasquale found that homeowners are more engaged citizens than renters. In experimental work, he found that students reporting being more trusting also act in more trustworthy ways. In recent years, Glaeser has argued that human capital explains much of the variation in urban and metropolitan level prosperity.\\" He has extended the argument to the international level, arguing that the high levels of human capital, embodied by European settlers in the New World and elsewhere, explains the development of freer institutions and economic growth in those countries over centuries. In other work, he finds that human capital is associated with reductions in corruption and other improvements in government performance. During the 2000s, Glaeser's empirical research has offered a distinctive explanation for the increase in housing prices in many parts of the United States over the past several decades. Unlike many pundits and commentators, who attribute skyrocketing housing prices to a housing bubble created by Alan Greenspan's monetary policies, Glaeser pointed out that the increase in housing prices was not uniform throughout the country (Glaeser and Gyourko 2002). Glaeser and Gyourko (2002) argued that while the price of housing was significantly higher than construction costs in Boston, Massachusetts and San Francisco and California, in most of the United States, the price of housing remained \\"close to the marginal, physical costs of new construction.\\" They argued that dramatic differences in price of housing versus construction costs occurred in places where permits for new buildings had become difficult to obtain (since the 1970s). Compounded with strict zoning laws the supply of new housing in these cities was seriously disrupted. Real estate markets were thus unable to accommodate increases in demand, and housing prices skyrocketed. Glaeser also points to the experience of states such as Arizona and Texas, which experienced tremendous growth in demand for real estate during the same period but, because of looser regulations and the comparative ease of obtaining new building permits, did not witness abnormal increases in housing prices. Glaeser and Gyourko (2008) observed that in spite of the mortgage meltdown and the ensuing drop in housing prices, Americans continue to face housing affordability challenges. Housing policy makers, however, need to recognize that housing affordability differs from region to region and affects classes differently. Public policies should reflect those differences. The middle class confront affordability issues that could be resolved by allowing for more new home constructions by removing zoning restrictions at the municipal level. Glaeser and Gyourko (2008) recommend direct income transfers for low income families to resolve their specific housing needs rather than government interference in the housing market itself. Glaeser (2011) claimed that public policy in Houston, Texas, the only city in the United States with no zoning code and therefore, a very elastic housing supply, enabled construction to respond to the demand of a plentiful number of new affordable houses even in 2006. He argued that this kept Houston prices flat while elsewhere they escalated. Contribution to health economics In 2003, Glaeser collaborated with David Cutler and Jesse Shapiro on a research paper that attempted to explain why Americans had become more obese. According to the abstract of their paper, \\"Why Have Americans Become More Obese?\\", Americans have become more obese over the past 25 years because they \\"have been consuming more calories. The increase in food consumption is itself the result of technological innovations which made it possible for food to be mass prepared far from the point of consumption, and consumed with lower time costs of preparation and cleaning. Price changes are normally beneficial, but may not be if people have self-control problems.\\" References External links * Glaeser's homepage at the Harvard department of economics * * Category:1967 births Category:Living people Category:American people of German descent Category:Scientists from New York City Category:Economists from New York (state) Category:Princeton University alumni Category:University of Chicago alumni Category:Harvard University faculty Category:Fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences Category:Fellows of the Econometric Society Category:20th-century American economists Category:21st-century American economists Category:Manhattan Institute for Policy Research Category:Fellows of the American Academy of Political and Social Science ","title":"Edward Glaeser"},{"id":"2438838","text":"Interstate 80N may refer to: *Interstate 80N (Oregon‚ÄìIdaho‚ÄìUtah), now Interstate 84 (Oregon‚ÄìUtah) *Interstate 80N (Iowa), became part of Interstate 680 from 1973 to 2019 and now Interstate 880 in 2019 *Interstate 80N (Ohio), now part of Interstates 90, 480, and 490 *Interstate 80N (Pennsylvania), now part of Interstate 78 80N N ","title":"Interstate 80N"},{"id":"2438851","text":"The North American P-51 Mustang is one of the best-known escort fighters of World War II. The escort fighter was a World War II concept for a fighter aircraft designed to escort bombers to and from their targets. An escort fighter needed range long enough to reach the target, loiter over it for the duration of the raid to defend the bombers, and return. A number of twin- engined heavy fighters with high fuel capacity were designed for escort duties before World War II. Such heavy fighters largely failed in their intended escort role during the war, as they were outmaneuvered by more agile single- engined fighters. As the war progressed, longer-range fighter designs and the use of drop tanks allowed single-engined fighters to perform escort duties. In the post-war era the introduction of jet engines and their inherent short range made escort fighters very difficult to build. The related concept of a penetration fighter emerged briefly in the 1950s and again in the 1960s, but did not result in any production aircraft. While the importance of dedicated escort fighter aircraft has waned following the end of the Second World War, the escort role has been diminished since modern air combat doctrine places a heavy emphasis on the idea of air superiority, and its importance in the ability of an air force to carry out effective operations. Air superiority is defined as a situation in which an air force dominates an airspace to such a degree as to be able to carry out any operations with no interference from enemy air combatants. Fighting an opponent with air superiority in a given battlespace is much harder, as any offensive or defensive tactics are likely to be overwhelmed.Lt. Col. Stoll, Hans G. (1994). \\"Luftwaffe Doctrine and Air Superiority throughout WWII: The Luftwaffe Experience.\\" United States Air War College. Pg. 1 Use in the Luftwaffe During the Battle of Britain, the Luftwaffe used Messerschmitt Bf 109s and Bf 110s based in France as escort fighter-bombers. Although flying from relatively close airfields in France, the Bf 109 was operating at the extreme of its range and unable to remain for long with the bombers if it was to have fuel to return, while the Bf 110, specifically designed for the escort role, had inferior performance and was easily outperformed by the Royal Air Force Supermarine Spitfires and Hawker Hurricanes. Flying with the Heinkel He 111 and Junkers Ju 88 medium bombers, they would drop their light bomb-loads and‚Äîfor a brief period‚Äîfight off the British fighters. U.S. Army Air Forces' operations The U.S. Army Air Forces' precision strategic bombing campaign against German industries was only possible during the day. At first, this was not seen as an issue; the Forces' Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress and Consolidated B-24 Liberator bombers were the most heavily armed aircraft of the time. Close formations of them were planned, creating a crossfire of .50 caliber machine-guns that would fend off the enemy with no need for a fighter escort. In the early stages of World War II, bombing runs often took place without escort fighters. German fighter pilots were scrambled to deal with these raids, and soon learned that it was much easier for them to take out formations which were unescorted as opposed to those who were escorted. As a result, fighters would attack bomber formations which were on long range operations, as they would not have escorts with them. USAAF bomber losses gradually increased, and experimental \\"gunships\\" like the YB-40 did nothing to reduce them. This prompted the United States Army Air Force to come to the conclusion that their B-17 bombers needed to do something to reduce losses, and eventually led to the development of long range escort fighters. Major Lesher, Lee A. (1988). \\"THE EVOLUTION OF LONG-RANGE ESCORT DOCTRINE IN WORLD WAR II.\\" United States Air Command and Staff College, pg. 6 The Lockheed P-38 Lightning had far greater range than its early contemporaries. It was not until the introduction of the Lockheed P-38 Lightning and Republic P-47 Thunderbolt fighters that the bombing raids could claim a measure of success. Able to carry large Lockheed-designed drop tanks, the fighters were able to escort the bombers for much of their missions. The first Allied fighters over Berlin were 55th Fighter Group P-38s on March 3, 1944. When the Merlin-powered North American P-51 Mustang was introduced, with a laminar-flow wing for efficiency, the final escort fighter development of the war was complete. Cold War The successes of the P-47N and P-51 gave the impression that the escort fighter was a concept worth continuing after the end of the war. The high fuel use of early jet engines made such aircraft difficult to design, and a number of experimental designs were tried that used mixed power, typically a turboprop and jet, but these failed to meet performance requirements. A new concept, the XF-85 Goblin microfighter, planned to act as a parasite fighter for the Convair B-36, was tested with a B-29 Superfortress and found to be utterly impossible to use operationally. Later the FICON project attempted a similar solution, docking jet fighters with heavy bombers via a trapeze mechanism or their wingtips. Whilst projects for dedicated escort fighters such as the XF-85 Goblin came to nothing, the advancement of technology and the nature of warfare of the wars being fought allowed the role of fighter escort to gradually merge with fighter types, so the term fell out of use. In Korea, the F-80 Shooting Star and later the F-86 Sabre escorted B-29 heavy bombers and F-84 Thunderjet strike fighters. Although the XB-70 Valkyrie, North American Aviation's Mach 3 bomber, was intended to be immune to enemy attack due to its speed, North American Aviation very briefly proposed the XF-108 Rapier interceptor for the escort role. In this case, the term \\"penetration fighter\\" was used, as the aircraft was not expected to actually escort the bombers, and was instead intended to fly into Soviet airspace well in advance of the bombers and attack the Soviet interceptors long before they could approach the bombers. With the development of guided missiles, particularly surface-to-air missiles, plans for dedicated escort fighters designed to escort nuclear bombers gradually faded from the scene. Missile technology meant that interceptors would rarely engage bombers directly, if ever, and the escorts could do little against missiles. At the same time, the advancement of land and submarine-based ballistic missiles relegated bombers to a lower importance ‚Äî they became just a single element of the nuclear triad in the US, and largely ignored entirely in the USSR. Furthermore, with the concept of mutually assured destruction high on the political agenda throughout the Cold War, a nuclear exchange became ever less likely, leaving existing fighter designs more than adequate for their protection in the wars being fought. In Vietnam for instance, F-4 Phantom IIs and sometimes F-8 Crusaders escorted the American bombers such as B-52 Stratofortresses, F-105 Thunderchiefs and A-4 Skyhawks. In some cases the missions of F-4 were \\"mixed\\", when some F-4 were equipped with bombs, and some F-4 acted as escorts (similar cases occurred with F-8). Modern era The advent of the air superiority fighter, such as the F-15 Eagle, meant that high value assets like tankers, AEW&C;, command platforms, bombers and attack aircraft would be protected by air superiority fighters, sometimes flying far afield and ahead of them, engaging distant enemy air units, rather than by direct escorts staying in sight nearby. The development of the multirole fighter, such as F/A-18, also decreased the need for escorts, as the aircraft on air strike mission became capable of effective self-defense. The development of close air support fighters and modern ground attack aircraft such as the A-10 Thunderbolt II meant that ground assets could be 'escorted' and protected by aircraft from above. The US Air Force is currently developing a new fighter escort for the anticipated next generation B-21.The Air Force Wants a New Fighter to Accompany Its New Stealth Bomber References See also *Aerial warfare *Interceptor, the main adversary of an escort fighter *Wild Weasel Category:Fighter aircraft ","title":"Escort fighter"},{"id":"2438864","text":"The Bishan Bus Interchange is a bus interchange serving Bishan, Singapore. The interchange commenced passenger service as Bishan Bus Terminal in 1988, with Services 56 and 58. Located at Bishan Street 13, it is designed in a unique squarish configuration with the building wrapping around the bus parking area. The Ministry of Education Language Centre (MOELC) lies across the field to the north. Passengers also able to transfer to the Circle Line from an entrance located right outside the interchange. History Bishan Bus Interchange opened on 30 April 1989. Built at a cost of SGD$5.5 million, it replaced the temporary bus station that had been serving the new town of Bishan since December 1985. It was among the first batch of bus interchanges built to integrate with a Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) station. As such, passengers can easily transfer between bus services at this interchange and the Bishan MRT station. Design The unusual design of Bishan Bus Interchange was even described in The New Paper as \\"a piece of Disneyland in Bishan\\". The interchange features a castle-like structure wrapping around the bus parking area. Above the interchange, there is a cafeteria as well as a car park. A children's playground and an adjoining structure that houses a now-defunct fast food restaurant was also constructed together with this interchange. Bishan Bus Interchange is physically linked to the neighbouring Junction 8 and to Bishan MRT station. Facilities Bishan bus interchange used to feature a fast food restaurant, being the first bus interchange in Singapore to have this facility. It also features a children's playground, which was designed to complement the fast food restaurant to make the bus interchange family- friendly. The bus interchange also houses a 560-lot car park above its premises. Bus Contracting Model Under the new bus contracting model, all the bus routes were split into 3 route packages: 50, 52, 54, 56 and 410 under Bishan-Toa Payoh, 57 under Bukit Merah and 53, 55, 58 and 59 under Serangoon- Eunos Bus Packages.

The railway was opened on 1 July 1885 and closed on 6 August 1914. History In 1879, South Parade Pier was opened by Princess Edward of Saxe- Weimarhttp://southparadepier.net/history.php in Southsea, a fashionable Victorian seaside resort in southern Portsmouth. South Parade Pier, measuring in length, began operating a passenger steamer service across the Solent to the Isle of Wight. This service gave rise to the idea of linking Southsea and its pier to Portsmouth's railway line, bypassing the busy town of Portsmouth and its crowded harbour. A similar scheme had already been operating between Clarence Pier and Portsmouth Town railway station since 1861.http://historyinportsmouth.co.uk/places/southsea-railway.htm The Southsea Railway Company was founded by Edwin Galt, who had been the mayor of Portsmouth from 1868 to 1869. Work on the new line began in March 1884, with Princess Edward of Saxe-Weimar cutting the first sod. The first and original terminus station of the Southsea Railway was named Southsea and was built in a grand Queen Anne style. The station was located to the north of Granada Road, Southsea,https://maps.nls.uk/view/101441955 and south of the southern side of St. Simon's Church, in St. Ronan's Road, Southsea. The station and its tracks were orientated diagonally north-east in parallel with the southern side of St. Ronan's Road, and had three long platformshttps://www.portsmouth- guide.co.uk/local/soutrail.htm under a glass paned roof. Southsea station, along with the Southsea Railway and Fratton railway station were jointly opened on 1 July 1885 by Lady Ada Mary Willis (n√©e Neeld), wife of General Sir George Willis, the Lieutenant Governor of Portsmouth.http://historyinportsmouth.co.uk/people/willis.htm The Southsea Railway was built to serve the fashionable Victorian seaside resort of Southsea, and at its northern end, the Southsea Railway connected to the Portsmouth Direct Line at Fratton railway station. The Southsea Railway line was an uninterrupted 1.25 miles (2 km) long, using cuttings excavated to pass under Old Bridge Road and Albert Road, then under earth-bank road bridges built at Devonshire Avenue and Goldsmith Avenue.Portsmouth Guide - the Southsea Railway At the railway lines northern end, after passing underneath the Goldsmith Avenue road bridge, it connected to a dedicated island platform at Fratton railway station - itself purposely built as an interchange station for the Southsea Railway and Portsmouth Direct Line. Fratton Station was also opened on the same day that the Southsea Railway was. An earlier alternative location for the Southsea Railway interchange station was originally planned at the newly built Station Road in Copnor, Portsmouth, but was not constructed, instead built at Fratton. Ironically, Copnor's Station Road still exists today, near to Copnor Bridge.https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@50.809768,-1.063603,178m/data=!3m1!1e3?hl=en- GB By the twentieth century, the Southsea Railway was experiencing competition with Portsmouth Corporation Transport electric trams and trolleybuses. Conventional steam trains on the line were replaced in 1903 with long steam railcars. The steam-powered railcars had small wheels and allegedly gave passengers a bumpy ride. In 1904, the original 1885 Southsea station building was leased out to a motor engineer business as a cost-cutting measure, the Southsea Railway terminus then moved south to a much smaller single wooden platform station named East Southsea, built directly on Granada Road itself. Two unstaffed station halts were added in 1904 at Jessie Road and Albert Road\\"The Southsea Railway\\" Robertson,K: Southampton, Kingfisher, 1985 Sadly, on 19 July 1904, South Parade Pier was destroyed by fire, before being rebuilt and reopening on 12 August 1908. On 4 July 1905, Fratton railway station's name was changed to Fratton & Southsea.http://www.starzina.com/Starzina%20Z%20Railways%20Portsmouth.htm The First World War, closure and fate By 1914, the threat of the First World War loomed. The final nail in the Southsea Railway's coffin was a government directive issued shortly after the declaration of war to the effect that railways unable to support themselves would cease operations at the earliest opportunity; and, as the line clearly fell into this category, the last train ran on 6 August 1914. The original 1885 Southsea station at Granada road was used as an munitions store during the war, while the rail line itself served as an additional overflow siding from Fratton railway station's goods yard. After the war, the Southsea Railway and its stations lay abandoned. Partial removal of the line was sanctioned by Section 55 of the Southern Railway Act 1923. The 1885 Southsea station at Granada Road was converted into a road vehicle garage business, until it was demolished in the 1970sHistory in Portsmouth (with further history and photos of the station and railcar) and later replaced with a residential cul de sac called Chewter Close which was named after former 1995 Portsmouth mayor, Malcolm Chewter. Legacy After the demise of the Southsea Railway, Fratton & Southsea station reverted to its original Fratton name on 1 December 1921. The Southsea station name was later transferred to Portsmouth's main Portsmouth Town railway station in 1925 creating the present-day Portsmouth & Southsea railway station name. Portsmouth was elevated to city status a year later in 1926.

Southsea Railway expansion According to a 18 June 2016 article by Bob Hind of Portsmouth's The News newspaper, plans for an expansion to the Southsea Railway network were once considered, but were ultimately never built.https://www.portsmouth.co.uk/lifestyle/heritage/end-of-the-line-for- railway-which-could-have-crossed-langstone-harbour-1-7436917 The expansion plan would have created a junction at Goldsmith Avenue for trains from either Southsea, Fratton or Portsmouth to travel along the northern side of Goldsmith Avenue to the road junction of Milton Road, following the exact former Portsmouth & Arundel Canal route through Milton, to the disused lock gates at Locksway Road beside Langstone Harbour. A new bridge across Langstone Harbour would have linked Portsea Island directly to Hayling Island by rail, and connect to the Hayling Island branch line. This, if ever created would have created a large railway loop in south east Hampshire, as the Hayling Island branch line continued north to Havant railway station on the mainland, which in turn was connected to the Portsmouth Direct Line railway. As noted by the newspaper article, this plan might have prevented the closure of the Hayling Island branch line on 2 November 1963. But as the Southsea Railway itself closed before this date in 1914, the alleged expansion plan was never seriously considered.

It was coined by Ashish Bose in the mid-1980s. BIMARU has a resemblance to a Hindi word bƒ´mƒÅr (‡§¨‡•Ä‡§Æ‡§æ‡§∞) meaning \\"sick\\". This was used to refer to the poor economic conditions within those states. Several studies, including those by the UN, showed that the performance of the BIMARU states were dragging down the GDP growth rate of India. During the period of 2008-2011, some of these states started to develop faster than some of the major states and the concept of BIMARU was being considered to be outdated. However in the recent years, this concept has reemerged due to faltering growth rates of the states. The present-day states of Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Uttarakhand were part of Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, respectively, at the time the BIMARU acronym was coined. As such, they may be included within the region, except Uttarakhand. Historical background In the mid 1980s, economic analyst Ashish Bose coined an acronym BIMARU, in a paper submitted to then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. Several studies, including those by the UN, showed that the performance of the BIMARU states affected the GDP growth rate of India. Recent developments In recent times some of these states have seen real push in terms of economic growth. Although, some of these states have experienced high growth rates, they still lag other more progressive states. Bihar's GSDP grew by 80% over the period 2006-2007, which was higher than in the past 2 years and one of the highest recorded by the Government of India for that period. They have laid greater emphasis on education and learning by appointing more teachers and opening a software park. People from Bihar, Uttar Pradesh contribute significantly to ARMY, C.I.S.F, B.S.F, N.S.G, I.A.F and many other Para military forces because of their large young population in India. Recently these states are working for their improvement by developing infrastructures, IT-parks and giving a better invitation to the businessmen for investment. Also Madhya Pradesh enlisted at second position in U.N.O. GDP development ranking's with a record of 225%. Population growth The BIMARU states have some of the highest fertility rates in India. In 2010, the total fertility rate was 3.9 for Bihar, 3.5 for Uttar Pradesh, 3.2 for Madhya Pradesh, and 3.1 for Rajasthan, compared to 2.5 for India as a whole. This leads to high population growth in these states than rest of India.\\"Annual estimates of Total Fertility rate by residence, India and bigger States, 2005-10\\" Planning Commission, Government of India. Accessed 21 June 2012. Literacy rates The literacy rates in these states according to the 2011 census are Bihar 63.8%, Rajasthan 67.1%, Jharkhand 67.6%, Madhya Pradesh 70.6% and Uttar Pradesh 71.7% against a national average of 74.04%. While they trail the national average in the current literacy rate, they are registering very healthy growth rates in literacy comfortably outpacing states like Andhra Pradesh (67.7%) and Chhattisgarh (71%), which have comparable literacy levels (the exception being Rajasthan). A recent survey by National University of Educational Planning and Administration (UNEPA) has determined that only 21% of all primary school teachers in Bihar and 12.8% in UP are Matriculates or lower. Renowned educationists have asked for a complete overhaul of the educational system, particularly at the primary level. Health care The life expectancy in BIMARU states is lower than other Indian states. In fact, it is lower than the average life expectancy of India as a whole, implying that these states bring down the overall average as a whole. Economic growth Corruption remains one of the key factors reflecting poverty levels throughout the world and these states generally fare worse in the corruption indexes usually published. It is one of the enigmas that in spite of the large representation in the parliament, these states could not get adequate resources for their development. Another factor determining the BIMARU states' economic situation is the lack of investment in irrigation and flood control. In spite of the highest incidence of floods in this region, the investment to manage this has been rather meager. Even though the socialist era in India was known for large infrastructure projects, the most modern irrigation system of Bihar is the British built Son Command Canal System which was opened for use in the 1890s. This is in sharp contrast to projects like Bhakra Nangal Dam in Punjab. Yet another factor is the lack of perspective in the planning exercise. For example, even though large portions of the national highway schemes: the Golden Quadrilateral and the East West corridor pass through the so-called BIMARU states, its alignment would not serve the population of these states. Let alone the main alignment, there is no provision even for by-passes to serve towns such as Ranchi, Patna, Dhanbad, Gaya or Jamshedpur. Since 2005, Bihar is seeing a revival. Latest figures show that it is self-sufficient in food. The state recently fought to have the debilitating provisions of the central sugar policy revoked. The result is that 25 new sugar factories have been committed by private entrepreneurs in the state over the last year or so. Since 2000, there has also been a change in the geographic composition of these states, with Bihar being bifurcated into Bihar and Jharkhand; Madhya Pradesh being bifurcated into Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh; and Uttar Pradesh being bifurcated into Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand.

He began practicing law in his hometown of Shelbyville in 1889. The following year he moved to Chattanooga, where he worked in various law firms until 1917. Frierson held a variety of local government positions before being appointed United States Solicitor General. In 1905, Frierson was elected mayor of Chattanooga and held that position until 1907. He served as city attorney from 1912-1915. Subsequently, Frierson was named a special justice of the Tennessee Supreme Court in 1916. In 1917, Frierson was appointed United States Assistant Attorney General, a position he held until 1920. During his time as Assistant Attorney General, he was involved in the Hughes Aircraft Investigation, where he questioned witnesses to the production and inspection of timber for American aircraft. In June 1920, President Woodrow Wilson nominated and the Senate confirmed Frierson to be solicitor general. As SG, Frierson made persuasive arguments upholding the National Prohibition Act of 1919, which enforced the Eighteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution dealing with the prohibition of alcohol. When the question arose regarding the sale and possession of alcohol by Americans on ships, the Supreme Court agreed with his argument that no liquor could be sold on any U.S. flagged vessels. After serving as solicitor general, Frierson returned to Chattanooga to be a member of the Williams & Frierson law firm. From 1922-1923, he served as president of the Tennessee State Bar Association. William married Margaret (Daniel) on April 20, 1892, with whom he had three children: Margaret Williamson, Robert Payne, and Sue Lawwill. On May 25, 1953, Frierson died of a cerebral hemorrhage at the age of 84.

The term was first used in one version of the Chronicle of the Priest of Dioclea, which is as a whole dated to have been written in 1298‚Äì1300. It was in later years mentioned by a number of sources in various languages and by a number of people of different backgrounds. In the 19th century, during the Age of Romantic Nationalism, it became a central point of discussion and research, often a component part of Croatian nationalism, in which Red Croatia was sometimes popularized as a historical state of the Croatian people and thus should become part of a Greater Croatia.  Etymology  Red Croatia was first mentioned in the Chronicle of the Priest of Dioclea a fictional work which was written by a Roman Catholic priest in Doclea. His work is not preserved in original, but only in copies since the 16th and 17th century, and has been dated from as early as the late 13th century to as far as the 15th century. It is most likely that it was written c. 1300. There were numerous erroneous guesses and other plain errors regarding the identity of the writer, the most known being referring to him as \\"Archbishop Gregory\\" of a non-existent Archbishopric. Most recent and detailed research identifies him as a member of the Cistercian order by the name of Rudger, of Bohemian ethnic origins, working in the Archbishopric of Split and for Croatian Ban Paul ≈†ubiƒá who was from 1298 to 1301 Archbishop of Bar. If the Priest of Doclea didn't take the term from some unknown and unpreserved source while rewriting his work for a second edition and he is its inventor, it is believed that he did partially in political aspirations of the ≈†ubiƒá family over all Croat lands, which would also explain the lack of Red Croatia in the first version, which centered on Bosnia, the second one being written after Paul had taken the title \\"Lord of Bosnia\\". Croatian linguist Petar Skok has defined that this misinterpretation on the Priest's part is a result of transliteration of the Crmnica or Crvnica area in Montenegro, which also translates to \\"Red Land\\". According to the Dioclean priest imaginary kingdom of Slavs was divided into two regions: Maritima (Littoral) between Dinaric mountains and the Adriatic sea which was also defined as the area where the\\"rivers from the mountains flow south into the sea\\" and Serbia which encompassed everything between Dinaric mountains and the river Danube or as defined in the chronicle as the \\"region where the rivers flow from the mountains to the north into the mighty river of Danube.\\" Thus the Maritima encompassed only the areas in the Adriatic sea drainage basin while Serbia encompassed areas in the Black sea ( Danube ) basin . Maritima was further divide in two areas: White and Red Croatia with latter encompassing present day Hercegovina, southern portion of Montenegro and northern Albania. On the other hand, Dioclean's Serbia would encompass most of present-day Serbia, northern part of Montenegro, most of the Bosnia and Croatia north of the Dinaric mountains.T.≈Ωivkoviƒá, Regum Slavorum, V.1, Belgrade 2009, 54-58  Original references  Map of fictituous Slavic kingdom of king Svetopelek in the Western Balkans as it has been described in the chronicle Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja. The Latin version of the Chronicle of the Priest of Dioclea, known as Gesta regum Sclavorum, was translated by Croatian-Latin historian Ioannes Lucius (Ivan Luƒçiƒá, the father of Croatian historiography) in 1666 and printed under the name De Regno Dalmatiae et Croatiae (On the Kingdom of Dalmatia and Croatia).

Individual signals and pins are assumed to be stuck at Logical '1', '0' and 'X'. For example, an input is tied to a logical 1 state during test generation to assure that a manufacturing defect with that type of behavior can be found with a specific test pattern. Likewise the input could be tied to a logical 0 to model the behavior of a defective circuit that cannot switch its output pin. Not all faults can be analyzed using the stuck- at fault model. Compensation for static hazards, namely branching signals, can render a circuit untestable using this model. Also, redundant circuits cannot be tested using this model, since by design there is no change in any output as a result of a single fault.  Single stuck at line  Single stuck line is a fault model used in digital circuits. It is used for post manufacturing testing, not design testing. The model assumes one line or node in the digital circuit is stuck at logic high or logic low. When a line is stuck it is called a fault. Digital circuits can be divided into: # Gate level or combinational circuits which contain no storage (latches and/or flip flops) but only gates like NAND, OR, XOR, etc. # Sequential circuits which contain storage. This fault model applies to gate level circuits, or a block of a sequential circuit which can be separated from the storage elements. Ideally a gate-level circuit would be completely tested by applying all possible inputs and checking that they gave the right outputs, but this is completely impractical: an adder to add two 32-bit numbers would require 264 = 1.8*1019 tests, taking 58 years at 0.1 ns/test. The stuck at fault model assumes that only one input on one gate will be faulty at a time, assuming that if more are faulty, a test that can detect any single fault, should easily find multiple faults. To use this fault model, each input pin on each gate in turn, is assumed to be grounded, and a test vector is developed to indicate the circuit is faulty. The test vector is a collection of bits to apply to the circuit's inputs, and a collection of bits expected at the circuit's output. If the gate pin under consideration is grounded, and this test vector is applied to the circuit, at least one of the output bits will not agree with the corresponding output bit in the test vector. After obtaining the test vectors for grounded pins, each pin is connected in turn to a logic one and another set of test vectors is used to find faults occurring under these conditions. Each of these faults is called a single stuck-at-0 (s-a-0) or a single stuck-at-1 (s-a-1) fault, respectively. This model worked so well for transistor-transistor logic (TTL), which was the logic of choice during the 1970s and 1980s, that manufacturers advertised how well they tested their circuits by a number called \\"stuck-at fault coverage\\", which represented the percentage of all possible stuck-at faults that their testing process could find. While the same testing model works moderately well for CMOS, it is not able to detect all possible CMOS faults. This is because CMOS may experience a failure mode known as a stuck-open fault, which cannot be reliably detected with one test vector and requires that two vectors be applied sequentially. The model also fails to detect bridging faults between adjacent signal lines, occurring in pins that drive bus connections and array structures. Nevertheless, the concept of single stuck-at faults is widely used, and with some additional tests has allowed industry to ship an acceptable low number of bad circuits. The testing based on this model is aided by several things: # A test developed for a single stuck-at fault often finds a large number of other stuck-at faults. # A series of tests for stuck- at faults will often, purely by serendipity, find a large number of other faults, such as stuck-open faults. This is sometimes called \\"windfall\\" fault coverage. # Another type of testing called IDDQ testing measures the way the power supply current of a CMOS integrated circuit changes when a small number of slowly changing test vectors are applied. Since CMOS draws a very low current when its inputs are static, any increase in that current indicates a potential problem.

The CCCP is developed and maintained by members of various fansubbing groups. The name is a pun on the name of the Soviet Union; namely, the Cyrillic alphabet version of the abbreviation of its full name (–°–æ—éÃÅ–∑ –°–æ–≤–µÃÅ—Ç—Å–∫–∏—Ö –°–æ—Ü–∏a–ª–∏—Å—Ç–∏ÃÅ—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö –†–µ—Å–ø—ÉÃÅ–±–ª–∏–∫). As part of the joke, the project's logo features the hammer and sickle and star from the Flag of the Soviet Union. The CCCP was last updated on 2015-10-18. Purpose CCCP was created to fulfill the following: * Alleviate the major problems caused by conflicting codec packs * Provide a video media playback standard for the anime community * Be capable of playing back most common video media files and formats * Be easy to install and uninstall ‚Äî even for users with no technical knowledge The pack is small and compact, containing only what is needed for most videos; it intentionally disables support for many codecs it considers unnecessary. It thus can potentially avoid problems caused by inappropriate combinations of filters by providing an all-inclusive playback solution. To view a CCCP- approved video, one must simply theoretically uninstall all other codec packs and install the CCCP. This philosophy leads to some disadvantages; since many formats are not enabled by default, they have to be manually toggled by the user if needed. Additionally, unlike many competing packs, CCCP is designed around decoding rather than encoding, and as such doesn't include many video encoders that other packs do. The CCCP is made only for the Microsoft Windows operating system and works with Windows XP/Vista/7/8/10. The last release to support Windows 2000 is 2010-10-10; the last release to support Windows 98/Me is 2007-02-22. Reception In 2006, On2 began recommending the CCCP as a simple decoding solution to feed video and audio to their Flix encoding application. The CCCP staff recommends to not use On2's included registry patch, but rather turn on or off any necessary codecs within the CCCP settings menu.

He ruled the kingdom from 1389 to 1413. Rule = Persecution of Hindus = He is remembered for perpetrating violence and torture upon his non-Muslim subjects in a bid to make them convert to Islam.Large numbers of Hindus converted, fled, or were brutally tortured and killed for refusal to convert during his reign. A rare photo of the ruins of the Martand Sun Temple near Anantnag, which was destroyed due to the iconoclastic policies of Sikandar Butshikan, photo taken by John Burke in 1868. Sikandar won the sobriquet of but-shikan or idol-breaker, due to his actions related to the desecration and destruction of numerous temples, chaityas, viharas, shrines, hermitages, and other holy places of the Hindus and Buddhists. He banned dance, drama, music, iconography and such other religious, cultural or aesthetic activities of the Hindus and Buddhists, and classified them as heretical and un-Islamic. He forbade the Hindus to apply a tilak mark on their foreheads. He did not permit them to pray and worship, blow a conch shell or even to toll a bell. So unspeakable was Sikandar's tyranny that he even stopped Hindus and Buddhists from cremating their dead or crying over death and compelled them to bury the bodies using Muslim rituals. They were not allowed to wear good clothes, bear arms or ride horses. He imposed the Jizya, a poll-tax to be paid by non- Muslims living as subjects in a Muslim state, and the levy was a heavy one: each non-Muslim (mostly Hindus) was required to pay an annual tax of four tolas of silver. Islamization of Kashmir During the Shah Miri dynasty, Islam spread in the Kashmir and his rule has been considered controversial by some scholars due to his alleged non-secular policies in Kashmir. In consonance with the customs in Delhi and elsewhere, Sikandar created the office of Sheikh-ul-Islam and more important, decided that the Islamic law should be valid instead of the traditional law. But, as in other places, that may have been restricted mainly to the personal law. It was during Sikander's reign that a wave of Sufi preachers headed by Mir Muhammad Hamadani (1372‚Äì1450) arrived in Kashmir in 1393. It is possibly under Hamadani's influence that Sultan Sikandar implemented an orthodox religious policy. The selling of alcohol, prostitution and gambling were prohibited. The non-Mulsims had to pay jizya, and were forbidden to display religious symbols like wearing tilak.

He studied medicine, took his degree at Turin, and then went to Paris, where in 1789 he joined the National Guard. In 1791 he tried without success to begin an uprising in Savoy, in 1792 he organized the L√©gion des Allobroges, and in the following years he served at the siege of Toulon, in the Army of the Eastern Pyrenees, and in the Army of Italy. He was captured at Rivoli, but was soon exchanged. In the spring of 1798 Dessaix was elected a member of the Council of Five Hundred. He was one of the few in that body who opposed the coup d'etat of the 18th Brumaire (November 9, 1799). In 1803 he was promoted general of brigade, and soon afterwards Commander of the L√©gion d'honneur. He distinguished himself greatly at the battle of Wagram (1809), and was about this time promoted general of division and named Grand Officer of the L√©gion d'honneur, and in 1810 was made a count. He took part in Napoleon's invasion of Russia, and was twice wounded. For several months he was commandant of Berlin, and afterwards delivered the department of Mont Blanc from the Austrians. After the first restoration Dessaix held a command under the Bourbons. He joined Napoleon in the Hundred Days and was appointed to command the 23rd Division in Marshal Louis Gabriel Suchet's corps on the Savoy frontier. His division included two battalions each of the 42nd and 53rd Line Infantry Regiments under General of Brigade Jean Revest and three battalions of the 67th Line under General of Brigade Jean Montfalcon. In 1816 he was imprisoned for five months. The rest of his life was spent in retirement.

It is a turn from one foot to the other, from forward to backwards (or backwards to forwards) in which the entry and exit curves are continuous and of equal depth (e.g. where each edge forms part of the same curve). Several variations are listed, Open and Closed. These relate to where the free foot is placed in relation to the skating foot on entering the turn, before weight is transferred. A swing Mohawk is another variation that is used in ice dance. It can be either open or closed. The free leg swings closely past the skating leg before returning to the skating foot to execute the turn. A common mohawk turn is the forward inside open mohawk. In this turn, the skater faces into the circle and the free foot is brought to the instep of the skating foot at an angle of 90¬∞ or more, before being placed on the ice on a backward inside edge during the transfer of weight. This leaves the former skating foot (and new free foot) in front of the new skating foot after the turn. Along with the 3 turn, this is one of the most common ways for skaters to change direction while skating, and is one of the first turns learned by beginning skaters. In a closed mohawk, the transfer of weight happens with the free foot being placed behind the skating foot rather than at the instep, so that after the turn the new free foot is carried behind rather than in front. Outside mohawks are similar, except that the skater faces outside of the circle. Again, there are both open and closed variants. Mohawk turns are essentially executed with crossed feet, and this is reflected in the tracings. In a good mohawk turn, the weight transfer is executed smoothly, without jerking of the hips or upper body. It is somewhat easier to accomplish this if the skater has open hip joints and can turn out the free foot at a greater angle before placing it on the ice, but lack of flexibility can be compensated for with careful timing. The corresponding turns from backward to forward do not involve crossed feet and are usually considered simple steps rather than mohawks.

They held the titles for over 5 months before losing to Tatsumi Fujinami and Kengo Kimura in January 1997. A few weeks later, Tenzan became a founding member of NWO Japan, as Chono joined the nWo in December 1996. For the rest of 1997, Tenzan and the rest of nWo Japan continued the nWo tradition of attacking their various enemies. Tenzan got his third chance for the IWGP Tag Team Titles in July 1998, after Chono's former tag-team partner Keiji Mutoh was injured. Tenzan and Chono went on to win the tournament and the belts. A month later, they were defeated by Genichiro Tenryu and Shiro Koshinaka. Tenzan continued to feud with Tenryu and Koshinaka, eventually getting a new partner in Satoshi Kojima, thanks to Mutoh's leadership in nWo Japan. The two teams fought at the Tokyo Dome in January 1999, with Tenzan and Kojima coming through, defeating Koshinaka and Tenryu to get the IWGP Tag-Team belts. A few months later, Koshinaka retook the titles from Tenzan and Kojima, with his partner Kensuke Sasaki. For the next year, Tenzan continued to wrestle in NJPW, feuding with Koshinaka, Masahiro Chono, Manabu Nakanishi, and others. He defeated Wild Pegasus at the Tokyo Dome in January 2000. In July 2000, Tenzan, still teamed with Kojima, got the IWGP Tag Team Titles for the 5th time, winning over Manabu Nakanishi and Yuji Nagata. Tenzan and Kojima feuded with Nakanishi and Nagata for the next few months, with Tenzan and Kojima coming out on top. On February 24, 2002, Tenzan made a brief appearance at WWA The Revolution pay-per-view from Las Vegas, Nevada where he choked Disco Inferno. Scott Steiner then attacked Disco in the ring. Tenzan could be seen sitting right behind the announcer's table when Disco joined commentary. He can be seen leaving the arena following Steiner's attack on Disco. Tenzan also won the IWGP Tag Team Titles in March 2002 with Masahiro Chono (their title reign lasting over one year; it also tied the team record for most championships won with Fujinami & Kimura), and again in December 2003 with Osamu Nishimura. After he and Chono lost the IWGP Tag Team titles to Hiroshi Tanahashi and Yutaka Yoshie, Tenzan went on a brief excursion to Canada in the summer of 2003, training with Tokyo Joe Daigo. When he returned for the G1 Climax, he transformed his wrestling style from a buffalo to an anaconda. The excursion worked, as he won his first G1 Climax, defeating NOAH's Jun Akiyama in the finals. In November 2003, Tenzan finally won the IWGP Heavyweight Championship from Yoshihiro Takayama. He would go on to drop the title less than a month later to unlikely victor Shinsuke Nakamura, who, at the young age of 23, became the youngest world champion in company history. Tenzan proceeded to win it three other times (in February 2004 from Genichiro Tenryu, December 2004 from Kensuke Sasaki and May 2005 from Satoshi Kojima). He lost the championship to AJPW Triple Crown Heavyweight Champion Kojima in a cross-promotional champion vs. champion match. The match had a unique finish designed to fool fans in attendance. The idea was to make it look like the match was going to end in a 60-minute time limit draw. However, with just seconds before the match would be declared a time limit draw, Tenzan, who was known to have a legitimate back injury, could not continue, resulting in Kojima being declared the winner and becoming the new IWGP Heavyweight Champion. NJPW officials had come up with the finish, which was designed to look like a \\"mistake\\", having agreed with AJPW that it would be better if Kojima won the match, but not wanting the match to end in a standard pinfall or submission. Tenzan defeated Kojima in a rematch three months later, bringing the championship back to NJPW. He lost the championship to Kazuyuki Fujita on July 18, 2005. Tenzan competed in the 2005 G1 Tournament, and almost made it to the semi-finals. In October 2005, Tenzan and Chono reunited to win the IWGP Tag Team Title for a fifth time from Hiroshi Tanahashi and Shinsuke Nakamura. On August 13, 2006 Tenzan defeated longtime rival Satoshi Kojima in the final of the 2006 G1 Climax, becoming only the second wrestler to go undefeated in a round robin style G-1. This would be his third G1 title. After severing ties with his old mentor Masahiro Chono, Tenzan founded the heel unit GBH (\\"Great Bash Heel\\", affectionately referred to by fans as \\"Great Big Head\\"); it was composed of Tenzan, Togi Makabe, Shiro Koshinaka, Toru Yano, Tomohiro Ishii and Tomoaki Honma. In February 2008, GBH turned on Tenzan with Makabe taking over the leadership of the group. Tenzan feuded with his former stablemates until the following October. Since returning to New Japan in May 2009, he has split his time between reforming Tencozy and teaming with old GBH teammates Makabe and Honma against CHAOS. In August 2009 Tenzan was sidelined with an injury. Tenzan in June 2014. Fifteen months later on November 18, 2010, Tenzan returned to the ring, defeating Antonio Honda at New Japan's NEVER.4 event. On December 11 Tenzan wrestled his first main show for New Japan since his return, defeating Gedo in Osaka. After the match Tenzan was attacked by Takashi Iizuka, restarting the feud between the two. On January 4, 2011, at Wrestle Kingdom V in Tokyo Dome, Tenzan defeated Iizuka in a Deep Sleep to Lose match, a match that could only be won by choking the opponent unconscious. In August, Tenzan took part in the 2011 G1 Climax, where he managed to win four out of his nine matches, finishing in the middle of his block. Later in the year, Tenzan and Kojima reformed their Tencozy tag team, defeating CHAOS members Hideo Saito and Takashi Iizuka in their return match on December 4. On January 4, 2012, at Wrestle Kingdom VI in Tokyo Dome, Tenzan and Kojima defeated Bad Intentions (Giant Bernard and Karl Anderson) to win the IWGP Tag Team Championship for the third time together, Tenzan's ninth time individually. On May 3 at Wrestling Dontaku 2012, Tenzan and Kojima lost the title to Takashi Iizuka and Toru Yano in their third defense. On July 22, Tenzan and Kojima defeated Iizuka and Yano in a decision match to regain the newly vacated title. On October 8 at King of Pro- Wrestling, Tenzan and Kojima lost the title to K.E.S. (Davey Boy Smith, Jr. and Lance Archer). From November 20 to December 1, Tencozy took part in the round-robin portion of the 2012 World Tag League. The team finished with a record of four wins and two losses, winning their block and advancing to the semifinals of the tournament. On December 2, Tencozy was eliminated from the tournament in their semifinal match by Sword & Guns (Hirooki Goto and Karl Anderson). On May 3, 2013, Tencozy regained the IWGP Tag Team Championship from K.E.S. in a four-way match, which also included Takashi Iizuka and Toru Yano, and Manabu Nakanishi and Strong Man, starting Tenzan's eleventh reign as champion. During early August, Tenzan competed in the G1 Climax, but midway through the tournament it was announced that, due to a fractured rib, he was pulled from the competition. Tenzan returned to the ring on October 14 at King of Pro-Wrestling, ironically just as Kojima was sidelined with an injury of his own, teaming with Takaaki Watanabe in a tag team match, where they were defeated by K.E.S. Kojima returned to the ring on November 9 at Power Struggle, where he and Tenzan lost the IWGP Tag Team Championship back to K.E.S. in a three-way match, which also included The IronGodz (Jax Dane and Rob Conway). In December, Tencozy made it to the finals of the 2013 World Tag League, defeating K.E.S. in the semifinals, before losing to Doc Gallows and Karl Anderson. On April 6, 2014, at Invasion Attack 2014, Tencozy defeated The IronGodz to win the NWA World Tag Team Championship. After four successful title defenses, they lost the title to K.E.S. on October 13 at King of Pro- Wrestling. The following month, Tencozy took part in the 2014 World Tag League, where they finished with a record of four wins and three losses, failing to advance to the finals. On February 14, 2015, at The New Beginning in Sendai, Tenzan defeated Rob Conway to win the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. He made successful title defenses against Kojima on March 21 and Big Daddy Yum-Yum on April 29. In the 2015 G1 Climax, Tenzan finished second to last in his block with a record of three wins and six losses. On August 29, Tenzan lost the NWA World Heavyweight Championship to Jax Dane in San Antonio, Texas. On April 10, 2016, at Invasion Attack 2016, Tenzan unsuccessfully challenged Katsuyori Shibata for the NEVER Openweight Championship. When the participants for the 2016 G1 Climax were revealed, Tenzan was surprisingly left out of the tournament. Tenzan was a former three-time G1 Climax winner and the holder of the record for most wins in G1 Climax matches, who had participated in every tournament since 1995 with the exception of the 2010 tournament, which he missed due to an injury. Afterwards, Tenzan repeatedly expressed his anger at being left out of possibly his last G1 Climax. However, on July 3, Satoshi Kojima bowed out of the tournament and agreed to give his spot to Tenzan under the condition that he goes on to win the tournament. Tenzan later confirmed that the 2016 G1 Climax would be his last. After kicking off his tournament with two wins, Tenzan lost all seven of his following matches, finishing last in his block. On March 6, 2017, Tencozy defeated Tomohiro Ishii and Toru Yano to win the IWGP Tag Team Championship for the sixth time. They lost the title to War Machine (Hanson and Raymond Rowe) on April 9 at Sakura Genesis 2017. Tencozy would participate in every World Tag Lague from 2015 onward, failing to advance to any finals. Tenzan main evented the retirement show for Takashi Iizuka who had betrayed him in 2008. Tenzan had been trying to convince Iizuka to team with him once more before his retirement, and after match (which Tenzan had won, pinning Iizuka) the two embraced before Iizuka attacked and retired as a villain. Tenzan competed in the newly expanded New Japan Cup in 2019, where he would lose in the Round of 32 to Ryusuke Taguchi , who was filling in for injured David Finlay. He would also compete in next year's tournament, losing in the same round to Yoshi-Hashi. Other media Tenzan appeared in the video for \\"Yonaoshi Good Vibration\\" by Japanese metal band Sex Machineguns. Tenzan also appeared as a cooking chief alongside Masahiro Chono on a movie called Kantoku Banzai! directed by Takeshi Kitano. He appears alongside Chono beating a few misconducted costumers (played by Togi Makabe, Toru Yano, Jado, Gedo and a CTU Themed wrestler). He has appeared on the Japanese television show Sasuke. Tenzan, along with fellow NJPW wrestlers Hiroshi Tanahashi, Kazuchika Okada, Satoshi Kojima, Tetsuya Naito and Toru Yano, appears as a member of the gang Justis in the 2016 video game Ry≈´ ga Gotoku 6.

The theatre includes a 500-seat Main Auditorium, and has also included various studio theatres over time. The Citizens' Theatre repertory was founded in 1943 by dramatist and screenwriter James Bridie, author of some 40 plays presented in Britain and overseas, art gallery director Tom Honeyman, cinema impresario George Singleton, known by many as \\"Mr Cosmo\\", whose headquarter cinema continues today as the Glasgow Film Theatre, and Paul Vincent Carroll, whose plays were first performed at the Abbey Theatre, Dublin (founder W.B.Yeats) and later on Broadway, winning the New York Drama Critics' Circle award for Shadow and Substance (1938) and The White Steed (1939). Under the leadership of James Bridie (Dr O.H. Mavor), the Citizens Company was based at first in the Glasgow Athenaeum. It moved in 1945 to its present site, the then Royal Princess's Theatre (opened 1878), where the building became the Citizens Theatre. Background The Victorian-era chandelier which hangs above the main auditoriumThe Citizens Theatre is based in the Gorbals area of Glasgow, Scotland and produces a breadth of work, from professional productions for its main auditorium and studio spaces through to an ongoing commitment to creative learning and engaging with the community. While the Citizens Theatre building retains some of the original Victorian architectural features, it has undergone additional renovations and expansions over the years. It now includes the 500-seat main auditorium, and two studio theatres. The main auditorium contains the original (1878) proscenium arch stage, which is raked (slopes down towards the auditorium); it has three seating levels: the stalls, the dress circle and the upper circle (or \\"gods\\"). The building contains the oldest original (1878) working understage machinery and paint frame in a working theatre in the United Kingdom. The paint frame is still used for scenic painting and its original glass roof remains. As part of the theatre's ongoing commitment to remain accessible, the Citizens endeavours to keep tickets reasonably priced. In 2008 over 900 children from the Gorbals and surrounding schools participated in a free workshop in their school and attended performances of The Wizard of Oz at the subsidised ticket price of ¬£2. The Citizens Theatre announced on 18 February 2013 that architects Bennetts Associates has been selected to work on the plans for the most comprehensive redevelopment of the building since it opened as a theatre in 1878. \\"Citizens Theatre Redevelopment\\" Contract work is now underway with an opening expected in 2022. Citizens Theatre and TAG The Citizens Theatre and TAG Theatre Company came together as one company in April 2007. Together, the new company offered a substantial programme of work each year, from professional productions on the Citizens stages to participatory work with people of all ages, backgrounds and cultures. TAG encompassed all of the work for children and young people. Citizens Learning focused on developing links between the Citizens Theatre and people of all ages living and working in Glasgow and the surrounding area, by encouraging them to engage with the theatre's work and participate in drama.

Producing theatre The Citizens Theatre main rehearsal room The Citizens Theatre is the west of Scotland's major producing theatre. Approximately 30 members of staff work backstage during the run up to a production, in addition to which up to 12 actors for a main auditorium production and a director may be rehearsing in one of the theatre's three rehearsal rooms. The production team includes stage management, lighting, sound, workshop, wardrobe and technicians. Costumes, sets, lighting and sound are prepared by the Citizens' backstage crew and the company produces several shows each year in the main auditorium, studio spaces and for touring. The Citizens Theatre is the only theatre in Scotland still to have the original Victorian machinery under the stage and the original Victorian paint frame is still used today to paint the backcloths for shows. Welding, carpentry, sewing, painting and papier-m√¢ch√© may be used to create sets for productions. Recently, Christmas shows have been fairy tales adapted by Alan McHugh and presented in highly theatrical productions offered as an alternative to pantomime.

The original facade of the Citizens Theatre (formerly the Royal Princess's Theatre) The theatre was built in 1878 (as Her Majesty's Theatre and Royal Opera House) and designed by leading architect James Sellars. It was one of 18 theatres built in Glasgow between 1862 and the outbreak of World War I in 1914 (during the same period seven were built in Edinburgh). It was the first theatre opened on the south side of Glasgow. Eventually there were four theatres built in the south side: The Palace, next door to the new theatre (now demolished), The Princess's Royal (formerly Her Majesty's, and now the Citizens), the Coliseum (now demolished), and the Lyceum in Govan . The remaining theatres built in this period still operating in Glasgow are the Pavilion Theatre, Glasgow, the King's Theatre, Glasgow, the Theatre Royal, Glasgow and the Citizens Theatre. The theatre, and likewise its future Palace neighbour created in 1904 out of the Grand National Halls, were built and owned by John Morrison as part of his development of tenements close to Gorbals Cross when the city was becoming the Second City of Empire. His building firm Morrison & Mason Ltd became one of the largest in the country, building the City Chambers, Stock Exchange, Queens Dock and much more. As Her Majesty's Theatre and Royal Opera House, he leased it to James F McFadyen, who had studied at Glasgow University and then became a lessee of theatres in England.Glasgow Herald December 1878 The theatre seated 2,500, and presented plays, revues and pantomimes. Reflecting the quality of Morrison's work the new building was very safety conscious, substantially built; with fire hydrants on each level and on stage. The stairways were extremely wide and the lobbies spacious. Morrison commissioned sculptor John Mossman to create the six statues which adorned the roof line, above the classical columns of the facade. A year later, in December 1879, the lease changed to H Cecil Beryl who changed the name to the long running title of Royal Princess's TheatreGlasgow Herald December 1879 For over twenty years the pantomimes staged by Beryl were written by Fred Locke. After seven years Beryl assumed a business partner Rich Waldon who would soon take over and buy the theatre from the builder. Waldon was also a writer and producer of pantomimes.Era dated 7 December 1907 By 1914 Rich Waldon was the busiest theatre operator with five theatres in the city - the Royal Princess's, the Palace, the Lyceum in Govan, the Pavilion and the West End Playhouse/Empress On his death in 1922 he bequeathed the Royal Princess's to his deputy Harry McKelvie who as a boy had started as a bill poster for him and now was the mastermind behind each year's longest running pantomime in the United Kingdom. 1923 saw a major modernisation of the auditorium which was now fully carpeted and the walls finished in wood panelling.ERA 17 October 1923 Late each Spring each pantomime, having completed its long run in Gorbals, would then tour round other venues in Scotland and England under McKelvie, who was also a shareholder and director of the Olympia Theatre, Bridgeton Cross. In the 1930s the next door neighbour variety-house the Palace was converted to a cinema and after television started it became a bingo hall. When Harry McKelvie let it be known he was retiring in 1944 he offered a generous ten-year lease to the new Citizens Company, who took it up and moved from the Athenaeum Theatre in Buchanan Street. In 1946 Harry McKelvie died, his funeral being held in the theatre. Ar the end of the lease in 1955 Glasgow Corporation bought the theatre and leased it to the Citizens company. The Citizens Theatre Company was formed in 1943 by a group of theatre-minded men led by Dr Tom Honeyman and James Bridie, one of Britain's leading playwrights. The name of the new company was taken from the manifesto of 1909 of Alfred Wareing\`s newly formed Scottish Playgoers Co Ltd for their repertory company, which was to provide live theatre for the citizens of Glasgow, staging new Scottish and international drama, opening at the Royalty Theatre. The 1909 manifesto of the Glasgow Repertory Theatre expressed these tenets: \\"The Repertory Theatre is Glasgow's own theatre. It is a citizens' theatre in the fullest sense of the term. Established to make Glasgow independent from London for its dramatic supplies, it produces plays which the Glasgow playgoers would otherwise not have the opportunity of seeing.\\" Originally based at the Athenaeum Theatre in Buchanan Street, Bridie's Citizens Company relocated to the Royal Princess's Theatre in the Gorbals in 1945 at the invitation of Harry McKelvie, \\"The Pantomime King\\". Bridie renamed it the Citizens Theatre and the Citizens Company opened there on 11 September 1945. =James Bridie= James Bridie, the main pseudonym used by Dr Osborne Henry Mavor, was a leading British playwright of international status, screenwriter and physician. During his medical career, his first play was produced in 1928 in Glasgow. He is a founding father of modern Scottish theatre, reflecting his creation of the Citizens Theatre, appointment as the first chairman of the Scottish committee of the Arts Council, and inaugurator of Scotland's first College of Drama in 1950, now part of the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland in Glasgow. He was instrumental in establishing the Edinburgh Festival.James Bridie He studied medicine at the University of Glasgow, then served as a medical officer during World War I in France and Mesopotamia. He became a senior consulting physician at the Victoria Infirmary and Professor of Medicine at Anderson's College. With the success of his comedies in London, Bridie became a full-time writer in 1938. The Bridie Library in Glasgow University Union, an organisation of which he was president, is named after him. The Citizens became immensely popular and had full houses, including school audiences and touring to communities, and staged a wide selection of productions in its first 25 years. = Innovation and growth = From inception, the Citizens Theatre company was a full-time professional company. The first managing director was novelist Guy McCrone assisted by his wife and soon after that the post was held by George Singleton of cinema fame. One of the first business managers was Winifred Savile formerly producer and manageress of Perth Theatre which had been created by her father J.H. Savile. By coincidence, her uncle, H.Cecil Beryl was lessee of the Royal Princess's Theatre from 1879 to 1887.The Citizens\` Theatre 21st Anniversary Conspectus, published in 1964 The board of directors included R.W.Greig, chairman of the Scottish National Orchestra, Norman Duthie, chartered accountant, and Sir John Boyd, lawyer. Following upon the first year in Buchanan street, which washed its face financially and the second year there which made a small profit, the first year 1945/46 in the larger and more comfortable theatre on the south-side attracted all its Athenaeum customers and a further 5,000 new patrons. Playwrights in the Citizens in its first year were: JB Priestley, Robert McLellan, Paul Vincent Carroll, James Bridie, Patrick Griffin, John Wilson, JM Barrie, Peter Ustinov, Robert Kemp, Bernard Shaw, Somerset Maugham, Anna LLouise Romoff, Gordon Daviot, Robins Millar, Gordon Bottomley and Moray McLaren. Seven of the productions were premieres. Production and art directors from 1943 to 1964 include : Eric Capon, Jennifer Sounes, Edmund Bacley, Matthew Forsyth, John Casson, James Gibson, Kenneth Mackintosh, Denis Carey, Michael Finlayson, Sir Tyrone Guthrie, Peter Potter, Alastair Sim, Colin Chandler, Richard Mathews, Fulton Mackay, Peter Duguid, Iain Cuthbertson, Albert Finney, Piers Hagard and Eric Jones. In its first 21 years the Citizens presented nearly 300 plays, of which 72 were British or world premieres. In the 1960s Glasgow Corporation decided to plan the construction of a new Theatre and Concert Hall in the city centre. This eventually emerged in the late 1980s as the Glasgow International Concert Hall, at the top of Buchanan Street, but without the envisaged theatre. The Citizens remain in its Gorbals site. =The 1969‚Äì2003 triumvirate= During the period from the 1970s to the 1990s, the Citizens was associated with innovative play selections and stagings by Giles Havergal, Philip Prowse and Robert David MacDonald. The three were responsible for the Citizens Theatre being again recognised as one of the leading theatres in Britain. Havergal and Prowse came from the Watford Palace Theatre in 1969. By 1971 Robert David MacDonald completed the triumvirate. Their internationalist approach was some distance from the original vision of a national theatre but did meet the access aspirations of the 1909 manifesto, not least in a commitment to low pricing. Giles Havergal Giles Havergal was Director of Watford Palace Theatre (1965‚Äì69) and director of the Citizens Theatre from 1969 to 2003. He directed over 80 plays in Glasgow including works by Shakespeare and Bertolt Brecht. He has also directed over 20 children and family Christmas productions. Havergal's production of Travels with My Aunt adapted from the Graham Greene novel of the same title, was first presented in Glasgow in 1989 and then played in the West End where it won a Laurence Olivier Award in 1993, and off Broadway in 1995. His production of his and Robert David Macdonald's adaptation of Death in Venice by Thomas Mann was first presented in Glasgow in 2000. It played at the Manhattan Ensemble Theatre, New York in 2002. Philip Prowse Philip Prowse was trained at the Slade School of Art and since 1970 was a Co-Director of the Citizens Company with Havergal and Robert David MacDonald. In 2003 both Havergal and MacDonald stepped down from their posts as directors of the company. Prowse however, continued his role as artistic collaborator with newly appointed Artistic Director, Jeremy Raison, until 2004. He directed and designed over 70 plays with the Citizens Theatre and has worked throughout the world designing and directing for opera, ballet and drama. Robert David MacDonald Robert David MacDonald became a Co-Director of the Citizens Company with Havergal and Philip Prowse in 1971 and retired in June 2003. In that time he wrote and adapted fourteen plays for the company: Dracula (1972); Camille (1974); De Sade Show (1975); Chinchilla (1977); No Orchids for Miss Blandish (1978); Summit Conference (1978); A Waste of Time (1980); Don Juan (1980); Webster (1983); Anna Karenina (1987); Conundrum (1992); In Quest of Conscience (1994); Persons Unknown (1995); The Ice House (1998), Britannicus (2002), Cheri (2003) and Snow White (2003). As an actor with the Citizens Company he played leading roles in more than twenty productions. He translated over sixty plays and operas from ten languages and as a director with the company he directed fifty productions including ten British or world premieres. Robert David MacDonald died in 2004. =1970s controversies= During the 1970s the Citizens started to attract controversy with its productions and advertising. The \\"Shakespeare in Drag\\" Poster which caused much controversy in 1975 In December 1970 city councillors called for an end to the 12,000 annual grant the Glasgow Corporation gave to the theatre after it was announced that anyone presenting a trade union card on 8 December would be granted free entry to the theatre. The Evening Times reported \\"The free tickets were suggested as a gesture of the actors' solidarity with the trade unionists' strike protest against the Industrial Relations Bill\\" (Evening Times, 7 December 1970). This was the first of many altercations between the theatre and the city council throughout the decade. Earlier in the autumn season of 1970 a controversial new staging of Hamlet caused outrage in the press for the nudity and alternative acting styles of the company. The Scotsman headline reported \\"Hamlet Depicted As A Gibbering Oaf\\" (7 September 1970) but the public flocked to the production and the theatre discovered an all new audience. Cordelia Oliver, a longterm supporter of the Citizens in her reviews, noted in The Guardian \\"Schoolchildren en masse rarely sit \\"Hamlet\\" out in silence, nor are they often roused to cheering as they did at the end last Friday. If Havergal has set his sights on a predominately youthful audience for the Citizens this reception suggest he may not be so wide off the mark\\" (10 September 1970). In 1975 a flier advertising the spring season was condemned by Labour councillor Laurence McGarry for its depiction of \\"Shakespeare, in drag with large cleavage, painted lips, corsets, suspenders and hand on hip\\". The councilor felt the theatre was guilty of \\"playing to an intellectual minority rather than the great mass of the public\\". In 1977 the Lord Provost Mr Peter McCann called for the sacking of theatre bosses after a performance of Dracula which featured nude scenes he described as \\"kinky claptrap appealing only to mentally ill weirdos\\" (Sunday Express, 13 March 1977). The Provost's calls were not supported by his councillors and his attempts to gain city council control of programming at the Citizens failed. The entire run of Dracula at the Citizens was a sell-out. Throughout its later existence the Citizens has been both criticised and acclaimed for its insistence on producing works which are not specifically populist, although heavily subsidised from public funds. While many have claimed that a citizens' theatre should deliberately appeal to a mass audience the theatre has a history of experimental works which have gained notice despite rather than because of their subject matter. =Rebuilding works= Following a fire, an order was made with little warning for the destruction of the Palace Bingo Hall (n√©e Theatre) in 1977. Staff of the Citizens arranged a stay of execution to rescue the best of the Victorian fittings, including the six statues which stood atop the columns. Following these works, almost the entire tenement block which had sat in front of the auditorium was razed, leaving the Citizens' foyer as the only remaining piece In an article for the Guardian newspaper, Bunny Christie described the theatre in this period as \\"[sitting] on its own, surrounded by potholes and puddles, everything else seemed to have been pulled down.\\" This state of affairs lasted until 1988, when the remaining foyer and bars were torn down as part of a new development on Gorbals Street by Strathclyde Regional Council, which included a new foyer and bars for the theatre. During the reconstruction, a limited \\"in the round\\" theatre operated on the stage behind the safety curtain, accessed via a temporary foyer located at an emergency exit with a capacity of 250. The main theatre was reopened for the Christmas show, in slightly makeshift fashion due to uncompleted works, as it had been identified as essential to the Company's finances. The new foyer, fronted in glass and yellow brick, opened in 1989 and lasted until its demolition, which began in September 2019. Further works throughout the 1990s included the creation of two studio theatres in 1991-92; office space on the north side in 1996-1998 which also included a new rehearsal room, scene dock, front-of house offices and lift access with National Lottery funding As part of the 2019-onward works, delayed somewhat by the COVID-19 pandemic, the south and west of the building, including the 1989 foyer, were demolished completely with the intention to rebuild both front and back-of-house facilities. During these works, the theatre closed completely, with shows from the Company taking place at Tramway and projects at Scotland Street School Museum (both COVID-19 restrictions permitting) in the meantime. =Foyer statues= Inside the Citizens foyer from 1977 were four elephant statues and four Nautch girls' statues, all in the baroque Anglo-Indian style, a reminder of the re-design of the adjacent Palace Theatre in 1907 by Bertie Crewe. The remaining two elephants and two more Nautch girls (or goddesses) can now be found in the Theatre Museum in London. The foyer also features statues representing William Shakespeare, Robert Burns and four muses, music, dance, tragedy and comedy, which were originally placed on the roof of the Royal Princess's Theatre and are the work of Victorian Glasgow sculptor John Mossman. The four muses are Music (Euterpe), Comedy (Thalia), Tragedy (Melpomene) and Dance (Terpsichore). The six pillars on which they sat were once the front of the Union Bank on Ingram Street. The statues were brought down from the building after nearly a hundred years on 12 July 1977 in order to protect them from demolition work taking place at nearby Gorbals Cross. The six statues will re-emerge on the roofline of the theatre in 2020. =Ghost stories= Over time, many patrons and staff members have reported sightings of ghosts. One long term staff member, trapped in the upper circle during a blackout, was led to safety by the distinctive outline of a monk. Customers seated in the dress circle during shows in the 1970s often inquired about the costumed \\"actor\\" who sat boldly on the balcony and stared back at them. Current staff members have caught glimpses of a \\"white lady\\" dressed in Victorian costume and flitting (moving) from the dress circle bar towards the circle studio dressing rooms. Backstage dressing room 7 is thought to be haunted by some of its past inhabitants and the upper circle has occasional visits from a strawberry seller girl, one of the most sighted of the Citizens ghosts.

It began with Carlo Petrini's protest against the opening of a McDonald's restaurant in Piazza di Spagna, Rome in 1986 that sparked the creation of the slow food movement. Over time, this developed into a subculture in other areas, like the Cittaslow organisation for \\"slow cities.\\" The \\"slow\\" epithet has subsequently been applied to a variety of activities and aspects of culture. Geir Berthelsen and his creation of The World Institute of SlownessThe World Institute of Slowness presented a vision in 1999 for an entire \\"slow planet\\" and a need to teach the world the way of slowness. Carl Honor√©'s 2004 book, In Praise of Slow, first explored how the Slow philosophy might be applied in every field of human endeavour and coined the phrase \\"slow movement.\\" The Financial Times said the book is \\"to the Slow Movement what Das Kapital is to communism.\\"Lucia van der Post (27 January 2010) Honor√© describes the Slow Movement thus: > \\"It is a cultural revolution against the notion that faster is always > better. The Slow philosophy is not about doing everything at a snail's pace. > It's about seeking to do everything at the right speed. Savoring the hours > and minutes rather than just counting them.

A fundamental characteristic of the slow movement is that it is propounded, and its momentum maintained, by individuals who constitute the expanding global community of Slow. Its popularity has grown considerably since the rise of slow food and Cittaslow in Europe, with slowness initiatives spreading as far as Australia and Japan.  Slow Art & Slow Art Day  Slow Art Dayhttps://www.slowartday.com/ is a global art movement, which was founded by Phil Terry and officially launched in 2009. During one day in April each year, museums and art galleries across the world host events focused on intentionally experiencing art slowly through slow looking. The movement aims to help people to discover the joy of looking at art, typically through observing a painting or sculpture for 10-15 minutes, often followed by discussion. You can read a summary of the movement in the 2019 BBC article 'Slow Art: It Will Blow Your Mind.'https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment- arts-47699001 The Slow Art Day HQ team publishes an Annual Reporthttp://www.slowartday.com/about/tools/ each year on their website, which features a range of events hosted by art institutions. Ageing Slow ageing (or slow aging) is a scientifically backed and distinct approach to successful ageing, advocating a personal and wholly encompassing positive choice to the process of ageing. Established as part of the broader slow movement in the 1980s, as opposed to the interventionist-based and commercially backed medical anti-aging system, it involves personal ownership and non-medical intervention options in gaining potential natural life extension.  Cinema  Slow cinema is a cinematography style which derives from the art film genre and which consists in conveying a sense of calculated slowness to the viewer. Slow films often consist of a resistance to movement and emotion, a lack of causality and a devotion to realism.https://kar.kent.ac.uk/43155/1/Screening.Boredom.Caglayan.pdf This is usually obtained through the use of long takes, minimalist acting, slow or inexistent camera movements, unconventional use of music and sparse editing. Well-known slow cinema directors are B√©la Tarr, Nuri Bilge Ceylan, Abbas Kiarostami, Tsai Ming-Liang, Andrei Tarkovsky and Theo Angelopoulos.  Cittaslow  The goal of the Cittaslow organisation is to resist the homogenisation and globalisation of towns and cities. It seeks to improve the quality and enjoyment of living by encouraging happiness and self- determination. Cittaslow cities use the concept of glocalization to prevent the impending globalization of their cities. Lisa Servon and Sarah Pink observe that, ‚ÄúThe case of the Spanish Cittaslow towns offers a particular example of how towns can actively exploit the interpenetration of the global and the local. In these towns, a local‚Äìglobal relationship has emerged in ways that enable controlled development and the maintenance of local uniqueness.‚Äù (2015) [Servon, Lisa J., and Sarah Pink. ‚ÄúCittaslow: Going Glocal in Spain.‚Äù Journal of Urban Affairs, vol. 37, no. 3, Aug. 2015, pp. 327‚Äì340.

Slow counselors understand that many clients are seeking ways to reduce stress and cultivate a more balanced approach to life. Developed by Dr. Randy Astramovich and Dr. Wendy Hoskins and rooted in the slow movement, slow counseling offers counselors a wellness focused foundation for addressing the time urgency and stress often reported by clients.\\"Slow Counseling: Promoting Wellness in a Fast World\\", Journal for International Counselor Education (2012) Volume 4.  Education  As an alternative approach to modern faster styles of reading, such as speed reading, the concept of slow reading has been reintroduced as an educational branch of the slow movement. For instance, the ancient Greek method of slow reading known as Lectio, which is now known as Lectio Divina, has become a way of reading that encourages more in-depth analysis and a greater understanding of the text being read. Though the method is originally of Christian monastic origin, and has been used primarily as a tool to better understand Bible scripture, its technique can be applied in other areas of education besides the study of theology.  Fashion  The term slow fashion was coined by Kate Fletcher in 2007 (Centre for Sustainable Fashion, UK).Fashion:Tailoring a Strategic Approach Towards Sustainability by Maureen Dickson, Carlotta Cataldi, and Crystal Grover \\"Slow fashion is not a seasonal trend that comes and goes like animal print, but a sustainable fashion movement that is gaining momentum.\\"What is Slow Fashion? by Jessica Bourland, Slow Fashioned The slow fashion style is based on the same principles of the slow food movement, as the alternative to mass-produced clothing (also known as fast fashion). Initially, The slow clothing movement was intended to reject all mass-produced clothing, referring only to clothing made by hand,Slow Clothing by Sharon Astyk, groovy green but has broadened to include many interpretations and is practiced in various ways.Slow Fashion 101 Functional and fashion novelty drives consumers to replace their items faster causing an increase of imported goods into the U.S alone. It is reported by the Economic Policy Institute that in 2007, the U.S has imported six billion dollars' worth in fashion articles. Popular brands, such as Patagonia, make products that are made to endure the test of time and be environmentally conscious. http://inthesetimes.com/article/5023/built_to_trash Some examples of slow fashion practices include: * Opposing and boycotting mass-produced \\"fast fashion\\" or \\"McFashion\\" * Choosing artisan products to support smaller businesses, fair trade and locally-made clothes * Buying secondhand or vintage clothing and donating unwanted garments * Choosing clothing made with sustainable, ethically-made or recycled fabrics * Choosing quality garments that will last longer, transcend trends (a \\"classic\\" style), and be repairable * Doing it yourself: making, mending, customising, altering, and up-cycling one's own clothing * Slowing the rate of fashion consumption: buying fewer clothes less often The slow fashion ethos is a unified representation of all the \\"sustainable\\", \\"eco\\", \\"green\\", and \\"ethical\\" fashion movements. It encourages education about the garment industry's connection and impact on the environment and depleting resources, slowing of the supply chain to reduce the number of trends and seasons, to encourage quality production, and return greater value to garments removing the image of disposability of fashion.\\"Slow Fashion\\" by Maureen Dickson, Carlotta Cataldi, and Crystal GroverSlow Fashion is not a TrendCline, Elizabeth L. (2012) Overdressed: The Shockingly High Cost of Cheap Fashion. Penguin Group. New York. A key phrase repeatedly heard in reference to slow fashion is \\"quality over quantity\\". This phrase is used to summarise the basic principles of slowing down the rate of clothing consumption by choosing garments that last longer. Thinking beyond fashion seasons, Loro Piano has referred to items that can be used throughout seasons as ‚Äúpermanent fashion.‚Äù There are designers out there, such as Amy Twigger Holroyd, who seeks for her garments to be passed down through generations by one having personal attachments to them. Hazel Clark states there are ‚Äúthree lines of reflection: the valuing of local resources and distributed economies; transparent production systems with less intermediation between producer and consumer, and sustainable and sensorial products...‚ÄùClark, Hazel. ‚ÄúSLOW + FASHION--an Oxymoron--or a Promise for the Future‚Ä¶?‚Äù Fashion Theory: The Journal of Dress, Body & Culture, vol. 12, no. 4, Dec. 2008, pp. 427‚Äì446.

Opposed to the culture of fast food, the sub- movement known as slow food seeks to encourage the enjoyment of regional produce, traditional foods, which are often grown organically and to enjoy these foods in the company of others. It aims to defend agricultural biodiversity. The movement claims 83,000 members in 50 countries, which are organised into 800 Convivia or local chapters.\\"What's Slow Food, Anyway?\\", The Washington Post Sometimes operating under a logo of a snail, the collective philosophy is to preserve and support traditional ways of life. Today, 42 states in the United States have their own convivium. In 2004, representatives from food communities in more than 150 countries met in Turin, Italy, under the umbrella of the Terra Madre (Mother Earth) network.  Gaming  Slow gaming is an approach to video games that is meant to be more slow-paced and more focused on challenging the assumptions and feelings of the player than on their skills and reflexes. A \\"Slow Games Movement Manifesto\\" was written by Scottish game designer Mitch Alexander in September 2018, and a \\"Slow Gaming Manifesto\\" was independently published on Gamasutra by Polish game designer Artur Ganszyniec in June 2019. Some games that can be considered examples of \\"slow gaming\\" include: Firewatch (2016), Heaven's Vault (2019), Journey (2012), and Wanderlust Travel Stories (2019).Slow Gaming. Piotr Gnyp, Magazyn Logo 10/2019  Gardening  Slow gardening is an approach that helps gardeners savor what they grow using all their senses through all the seasons. It is not about being lazy; rather it is aimed at getting more out of what they do.  Goods  Slow goods takes its core direction from various elements of the overall slow movement and applying it to the concept, design and manufacturing of physical objects. It focuses on low production runs, the usage of craftspeople within the process and on-shore manufacturing. Proponents of this philosophy seek and collaborate with smaller, local supply and service partners. Slow goods practitioners must have those tenets baked into their business model, it must be the top driver in the procurement of sustainable materials and manufacturing techniques. The rationale for this local engagement facilitates the assurance of quality, the revitalisation of local manufacturing industries and reduces greatly the footprint related to the shipment of goods across regions of land and or water. Again, quality always supersedes quantity. The genesis of a product is becoming more of concern for consumers. Some companies have now woven this philosophy into their corporate structure. The source of a product and its parts has become increasingly more important. Physical goods affected by the slow movement represent much diversity, including architecture and building design. The slow movement is affecting the concept and planning stages of commercial buildings, chiefly LEED certified projects.Slow Design in Building Practice This movement seeks to break current conventions of perpetuating the disposable nature of mass production. By using higher-quality materials and craftsmanship, items attain a longer lifespan that harkens back to manufacturing golden era of the past.  Living  Slow living is a lifestyle choice. Authors Beth Meredith and Eric Storm summarize slow living as follows: > Slow Living means structuring your life around meaning and fulfillment. > Similar to \\"voluntary simplicity\\" and \\"downshifting,\\" it emphasizes a less- > is-more approach, focusing on the quality of your life. ... Slow Living > addresses the desire to lead a more balanced life and to pursue a more > holistic sense of well-being in the fullest sense of the word. In order to embrace the benefits of Slow Living we should start with daily mundane tasks. For example when we brush our teeth, take a bath we are normally distracted and focus is to complete that activity as soon as possible. If we do these everyday tasks slowly we will be more mindful and hence we connect more deeply. The degree of joy after doing mundane tasks slowly will be immense and benefits of slow living will slowly creep into our life.Meredith, Beth and Storm, Eric. \\"Slow Living - Learning to Savor and Fully Engage with Life\\". Create-The-Good-Life.com. 2009. Retrieved 2011-3-20.  Marketing  Slow marketing is a reaction to the perceived \\"always-on\\" nature of digital marketing. It emphasizes a customer-centric outlook, sustainability, and ethics. Slow marketing builds relationships with customers instead of encouraging immediate results, such as a limited time offer.  Media  Slow Media and Slow Television are movements aiming at sustainable and focused media production as well as media consumption. They formed in the context of a massive acceleration of news distribution ending in almost real- time digital media such as Twitter. Beginning in 2010, many local Slow Media initiatives formed in the USASlow Media Blog by Jennifer Rauch and Europe (Germany,German Slow Media Manifesto France, Italy) leading to a high attention in mass-media.Forbes Magazine, \\"Time for a Slow-Word Movement\\" Others experiment with a reduction of their daily media intake and log their efforts online (\\"slow media diet\\"). Medicine Slow medicine fosters taking time in developing a relationship between the practitioner and the patient, and in applying medical knowledge, technology and treatment to the specific and unique character of the patient in his or her overall situation.Victoria Sweet (2017). Slow Medicine: The Way to Healing, Riverhead Books.  Money  Slow Money is a specific non-profit organisation, founded to organise investors and donors to steer new sources of capital to small food enterprises, organic farms, and local food systems. Slow Money takes its name from the Slow Food movement. Slow Money aims to develop the relationship between capital markets and place, including social and soil fertility. Slow Money is supporting the grass-roots mobilisation through network building, convening, publishing, and incubating intermediary strategies and structures of funding.  Parenting  Slow parenting encourages parents to plan less for their children, allowing them to explore the world at their own pace. It is a response to hyper-parenting and helicopter parenting; the widespread trend for parents to schedule activities and classes after school every day and every weekend, to solve problems on behalf of the children, and to buy commercial services and products. It was described by Carl Honor√© in Under Pressure: Rescuing Our Children from the Culture Of Hyper-Parenting.  Photography  Slow photography is a term describing a tendency in today's contemporary photography and visual arts. In response to the spread the snapshot, artists and photographers retake manual techniques and working methods to work slower, manually and in constant dialogue with the physical materials of the images. A broader interpretation of Slow Photography applies to all kinds of image making, including film and digital processes. The \\"Slow Photography Movement\\" website www.slowphotographymovement.com, and related social media accounts, was launched in 2018. The effort is a collaboration by several photographers to promote the slowing down of experiencing places, and the making of stronger connections to place. The effort offers an alternative to the quick-hit images that saturate social media, which usually lack in content and story-telling. As of October 2019 the main contributors to the website are photographers Ernesto Ruiz, Jennifer Renwick, and Beth Young. Apart from their writings, their work has included Slow Photography focused exhibitions and seminars. The term was first introduced by Norwegian photographer, artist and photo educator Johanne Seines Svendsen in the article \\"The Slow Photography ‚Äì In Motion\\", published in the book Through a Glass, Darkly in January 2013, in collaboration with the North Norwegian Art Center, the Arts Council of Norway, and the Norwegian Photographical Fund. The term was put into shape in the installation The Slow Photography at The 67th North Norwegian Art Exhibition, first opened in the city of Bod√∏ in January 2013. The installation contained five original ambrotypes and alumitypes presented in a monter; and presents contemporary work with the historical photographical process wet-plate collodion (1851‚Äì1880).  Religion  Slow church is a movement in Christian praxis which integrates slow-movement principles into the structure and character of the local church. The phrase was introduced in 2008 by Christian bloggers working independently who imagined what such a \\"slow church\\" might look like. Over the next several years, the concept continued to be discussed online and in print by various writers and ministers. In July 2012, a three- day conference titled Slow Church: Abiding Together in the Patient Work of God was held on the campus of DePaul University in Chicago on the topic of slow church and featured Christian ethicist Stanley Hauerwas and Kyle Childress, among others. An online blog called \\"Slow Church\\" written by C. Christopher Smith and John Pattison is hosted by Patheos, and Smith and Pattison have written a book by the same name, published in June 2014. Ethics, ecology, and economy are cited as areas of central concern to slow church. Smith describes slow church as a \\"conversation\\" not a movement and has cited New Monasticism as an influence. In its emphases on non-traditional ways for churches to operate and on \\"conversation\\" over dogma and hierarchy, slow church is also related to the broader Christian \\"emerging church\\" movement.  Scholarship  Slow scholarship is a response to hasty scholarship and the demands of corporatized neoliberal academic culture, which may compromise the quality and integrity of research, education and well-being. This movement attempts to counter the erosion of humanistic education, analyze the consequences of the culture of speed, and \\"explores alternatives to the fast-paced, metric- oriented neoliberal university through a slow-moving conversation on ways to slow down and claim time for slow scholarship and collective action.\\"  Science  The slow science movement's objective is to enable scientists to take the time to think and read. The prevalent culture of science is publish or perish, where scientists are judged to be better if they publish more papers in less time, and only those who do so are able to maintain their careers. Those who practice and promote slow science suggest that \\"society should give scientists the time they need\\".The Slow Science Academy, \\"The Slow Science Manifesto\\"  Technology  The slow technology approach aims to emphasise that technology can support reflection rather than efficiency. This approach has been discussed through various examples, for example those in interaction designHalln√§s, Lars and Johan Redstr√∂m (2001). \\"Slow Technology: Designing for Reflection\\", Personal Ubiquitous Computing, 5, 3, pp. 201-212 or virtual environments.Roudavski, Stanislav (2013).

Bertelsen, Niels Olof Bouvin, Peter G. Krogh and Kynd Morten (Aarhus, Denmark: ACM), pp. 49-58 critical design and critical technical practice.  Thought (Philosophy)  Slow Thought calls for a slow philosophy to ease thinking into a more playful and porous dialogue about what it means to live. Vincenzo Di Nicola's \\"Slow Thought Manifesto\\" elucidates and illuminates Slow Thought through seven proclamations, published and cited in English and Portuguese and frequently cited in French: # Slow Thought is marked by peripatetic Socratic walks, the face-to-face encounter of Emmanuel Levinas, and Mikhail Bakhtin‚Äôs dialogic conversations # Slow Thought creates its own time and place # Slow Thought has no other object than itself # Slow Thought is porous # Slow Thought is playful # Slow Thought is a counter-method, rather than a method, for thinking as it relaxes, releases and liberates thought from its constraints and the trauma of tradition # Slow Thought is deliberate Notable Slow thinkers include Giorgio Agamben (on the philosophy of childhood), Walter Benjamin (on the porosity of Naples), and Johan Huizinga (on play as an interlude in our daily lives). Di Nicola's Slow Thought Manifesto is featured in Julian Hanna's The Manifesto Handbook as a reaction against acceleration, \\"elucidating seven principles, including the practice of being 'asynchronic' or resisting the speed of modern times in favor of the 'slow logic of thought' and working toward greater focus.\\" \\"Take your time,\\" the slogan of Slow Thought, cited by Di Nicola, is taken from philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein, himself a slow thinker: > \\"In a wonderful philosophical lesson that is structured like a joke, > Wittgenstein admonished philosophers about rushing their thinking: Question: > ‚ÄòHow does one philosopher address another? Answer: ‚ÄòTake your time.‚Äô\\"  Time poverty  The principal perspective of the slow movement is to experience life in a fundamentally different way. Adherents believe that the experience of being present leads to what Abraham Maslow refers to as Peak experience. The International Institute of Not Doing Muchhttp://slowdownnow.org is a humorous approach to the serious topic of \\"time poverty\\", incivility, and workaholism. The Institute‚Äôs fictional presence promotes counter-urgency. First created in 2005, SlowDownNow.org is a continually evolving work of art and humor which reports it has over 6,000 members.  Travel  Slow travel is an evolving movement that has taken its inspiration from nineteenth-century European travel writers, such as Th√©ophile Gautier, who reacted against the cult of speed, prompting some modern analysts to ask, \\"If we have slow food and slow cities, then why not slow travel?\\"hidden europe magazine (March 2009), \\"A Manifesto for Slow Travel\\" Other literary and exploration traditions, from early Arab travelers to late nineteenth-century Yiddish writers, have also identified with slow travel, usually marking its connection with community as its most distinctive feature. Espousing modes of travel that were the norm in some less developed societies became, for some writers and travelers from western Europe such as Isabelle Eberhardt, a way of engaging more seriously with those societies.hidden europe notes (August 2012), \\"The Warm Shadow of Isabelle Eberhardt\\" Slow travel is not only about traveling from one place to another, it is also about immersing oneself in a destination. It consists of staying in the same place for a while to develop a deep connection with it. Frequenting local places, spending time with locals and discovering their habits and customs can turn a regular trip into a slow travel experience. The key is to take one's time and to let oneself be carried along.Slow Travel, Barcelona Slow Travel Advocates of slow travel argue that all too often the potential pleasure of the journey is lost by too eager anticipation of arrival. Slow travel, it is asserted, is a state of mind which allows travelers to engage more fully with communities along their route, often favoring visits to spots enjoyed by local residents rather than merely following guidebooks.Slow Travel Europe, \\"The Slow Way\\" As such, slow travel shares some common values with ecotourism. Its advocates and devotees generally look for low-impact travel styles, even to the extent of eschewing flying. The future of Slow Travel is aiming toward reducing greenhouse gas emissions by reducing car and air travel because the rate we are using planes and cars is not sustainable for our atmosphere. Advocates believe that the combination of environmental awareness and cost efficient traveling will move people towards Slow Travel.[Dickinson, Janet, and Les Lumsdon. Slow Travel and Tourism, Routledge, 2010. ProQuest Ebook Central, https://ebookcentral-proquest- com.mctproxy.mnpals.net/lib/mspcc/detail.action?docID=585469.] Aspects of slow travel, including some of the principles detailed in the \\"Manifesto for Slow Travel,Slow Travel Europe (March 2009), \\"A Manifesto for Slow Travel\\" are now increasingly featured in travel writing. The magazine Hidden Europe, which first published the \\"Manifesto for Slow Travel,\\" has particularly showcased slow travel, featuring articles that focus on unhurried, low-impact journeys and advocating a stronger engagement with communities that lie en route. A new book series launched in May 2010 by Bradt Travel Guides explicitly espouses slow travel ideas with volumes that focus very much on local communities within a tightly defined area, often advocating the use of public transport along the way. Titles include Bus-pass Britain, Slow Norfolk and Suffolk, Slow Devon and Exmoor, Slow Cotswolds, Slow North Yorkshire and Slow Sussex and South Downs National Park.

Loyd Blankenship, aka The Mentor, described Goggans/Bloodaxe as \\"the best hacker I ever met\\". Goggans was raided by the US Secret Service on March 1, 1990, but was not charged. In a 1994 interview he claimed he had never engaged in malicious hacking, explaining: > ‚ÄúMalicious hacking pretty much stands against everything that I adhere to. > You always hear people talking about this so called hacker ethic and I > really do believe that. I would never wipe anything out. I would never take > a system down and delete anything off of a system.

I have never broken anything, I have never done > anything really, really, criminally bad.‚Äù But in a phone call intercepted by the Australian Federal Police as part of an investigation into Australian hacker Phoenix (Nahshon Even-Chaim) Goggans was heard planning a raid in which the pair would steal source code and developmental software from Execucom, an Austin, Texas, software and technology company, and sell it to the company‚Äôs rivals. In the call, recorded on February 22, 1990 and later presented in the County Court of Victoria as evidence against Even-Chaim, Goggans and Even-Chaim canvassed how much money they could make from such a venture and how they would split fees from Execucom‚Äôs competitors. During the call Goggans provided Even-Chaim with a number of dial-up access numbers to Execom‚Äôs computers, commenting: \\"There are serious things I want to do at that place\\", and \\"There‚Äôs stuff that needs to happen to Execucom.\\". While there is no evidence that Goggans and Even-Chaim acted on this discussion, Goggans' statement of his intentions calls into question the nobility of his hacking ethics.Even-Chaim was arrested on April 2, 1990 and later convicted of 15 computer crime offences; on October 6, 1993 he was given a suspended 12 month jail sentence and ordered to undertake 500 hours community service. An account of his arrest is also contained in According to Michelle Slatella and Joshua Quittner in their 1995 book Masters of Deception: The Gang That Ruled Cyberspace, Goggans was in the process of establishing his own computer security company in Texas in 1990. They claim he planned to recruit companies as clients by hacking them and showing how vulnerable their systems were to other hackers. , Goggans is an internationally recognized expert on information security. He has performed network security assessments for some of the world's largest corporations, including all facets of critical infrastructure, with work spanning 22 countries across four continents. Chris has worked with US Federal law- enforcement agencies on some of America's most notorious computer crime cases. His work has been referenced in publications such as Time, Newsweek and Computerworld, and on networks such as CNN and CNBC. He is a frequent lecturer on computer security and has held training seminars in nine countries for clients such as NATO, the United States Department of Defense, and Federal Law Enforcement agencies as well as numerous corporate entities. He has been asked to present at major conferences as COMDEX, CSI, ISACA, INFOWARCON, and the Black Hat Briefings. He has also co-authored numerous books including Implementing Internet Security, Internet Security Professional Reference, Windows NT Security, and The Complete Internet Business Toolkit. During the summer of 2003, Goggans was invited to become an associate professor at the University of Tokyo's Center for Collaborative Research. During the winter of 2008, Chris Goggans was in India for ClubHack India's own hackers' convention.

He was a vocal and prominent proponent of traditional values and practices in the Catholic Church. Career Clark studied for the priesthood at St. Joseph's Seminary in Yonkers, New York. He was ordained by Cardinal Francis Spellman in 1951. He then served as a teacher at Cardinal Spellman High School in the Bronx, New York. Following this, he served as Spellman's private secretary. =Church of the Annunciation, Crestwood, New York= Clark was appointed pastor of the Church of the Annunciation in 1980 by Cardinal Terence Cooke. He was a successful homilist and a connoisseur of art, especially religious art. With his eye for the aesthetic, he refurbished much of the sculpture in the lower church, and moved several pieces to the upper church ‚Äî including a Pieta and an enormous crucifix that now hangs in the back of the upper church. Clark oversaw a major restoration of the sanctuary of the upper church; this included a large marble altar, the altar stairs, and marble facade redesigned to face forward ‚Äî replacing the \\"portable\\" altar used for several years previously. The altar is now dedicated to the memory of Richard and Regina Fay. A hand-made papier-m√¢ch√© Christmas creche imported from Italy was acquired at this time as well ‚Äî with the help of the Mark and Alicia Barry Family, in Memory of Frank and Catherine Gleason. This work of art graces St. Joseph's Altar. Clark's successor, the Rev. Eugene Carrella, later commissioned the addition of a manger that replicates the marble columns and facade of the main altar. Clark was the first pastor to institute a Finance Council in the parish. He was also dedicated to the parish school and a more diverse curriculum. Under his stewardship and with Kevin Scanlon as the school principal for more than a decade, the school thrived and expanded with the creation of a kindergarten program. Clark later served as an official spokesman for Cardinal Cooke. =St. Agnes Church, New York, New York= After Annunciation, in 1986 Clark became pastor of St. Agnes Parish and High School in Manhattan. It was during this time that St. Agnes became a center for Catholic study, drawing professionals from architects to medical doctors to financiers and lawyers from all over Manhattan, who not only attended Mass but also attended regular classes in philosophy and theology, especially on St. Thomas Aquinas. In 1999 and 2000, Clark hosted a series of programs for the Catholic Eternal Word Television Network entitled Relationships, which made him better known beyond the Archdiocese of New York. =St. Patrick's Cathedral= In 2001, Cardinal Edward Egan selected Clark to be Rector of St. Patrick's Cathedral, the seat of the archdiocese. His duties as rector included running its day-to-day business, and he would preside at the main Mass on Sundays when the cardinal was unavailable. Clark was a leading fund-raiser for Catholic causes. He was Vice President of the Homeland Foundation, an organization which supports Catholic projects, and he established the first American chapter of the Patrons of the Arts in the Vatican Museums, a preservation group. A fellow priest memorably dubbed him \\"the Mother Teresa to the rich\\". =Accusation and resignation= On August 11, 2005, Clark resigned as rector of the cathedral in response to published allegations of adultery with his longtime secretary, Laura DiFillipo. He strenuously denied the allegations for the rest of his life. DiFillipo's husband had been seeking to divorce his wife, and collected surveillance video and photographs that he made widely available to the news media.

He is best remembered for captaining Surrey to a string of wins in the County Championship around the time it became official in 1890, aided by the bowler George Lohmann and back up by John Sharpe and William Lockwood. Shuter first led Surrey to the County Championship in 1887. They then came first in 1888, tied with Lancashire and Nottinghamshire in 1889, and won again in 1890, 1891 and 1892. Shuter was a batsman and chiefly an off-side player.Brief profile of John Shuter, CricketArchive. Retrieved 2020-06-05. John Shuter, CricketArchive. Retrieved 2020-06-05. . Shuter was born in Thornton Heath, Surrey, England, the son of Leonard Shuter, a stave timber merchant, and Caroline. John went to Winchester College, playing in its cricket eleven from 1871 to 1873. Though a Surrey man by birth, Shuter had played much club cricket in Bexley and was thus qualified by residence for Kent. After a single match in 1874, Shuter was rejected by Kent. He first played for his native county in 1877 and the following year jumped abruptly to the front rank of batsmen. He scored a century (then an exceptional feat due to the primitive pitches) against Sussex at Hove the following year and in 1880 became captain of Surrey. At first, rewards for this move were slow and Surrey entered a crisis around 1883 - by which time Shuter had become established as one of the best batsmen in England despite a number of failures for the Gentlemen against the Players in the years since 1879. However, after overcoming the crisis Surrey rapidly developed into a top-flight county side through Lohmann's bowling, which headed the list of first-class wicket-takers for seven successive years from 1885 to 1891. Shuter had his best seasons in batting from 1882 to 1887, though he never reached 1,000 runs in a season. He played one Test on his home ground in 1888, but by 1890, with only one score of over fifty, it was clear his best days as a batsman were over. He continued though, to play a major role as captain of Surrey until 1893, when owing to the failure of Abel and their other top batsmen, they declined from first to sixth among nine counties. Shuter made no score above 44 that season and owing to business resigned the captaincy. His only subsequent first-class match was for Surrey against Oxford University in 1909 at the age of fifty-four - with a team including Bill Hitch, over thirty- one years younger. Long after he retired he was appointed as a Test selector (for the triangular tournament held in 1912) and secretary of Surrey in 1919 - a role which he did not hold for long as a stroke caused his sudden death in 1920. Although most noted for his cricketing exploits, Shuter joined his father in business as a stave timber merchant and cooper.

The coastal area consists of sand flats with their associated salt marshes and coastal sand dunes. The Sandwich Flats stretch for about five miles (8 km) along the coast. The coastal habitats are of high ecological importance. Most of the bay bears national and international nature conservation designations. These include the Sandwich Bay to Hacklinge Marshes Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), the Sandwich Bay Special Area of Conservation (SAC),JNCC SAC list the Thanet Coast and Sandwich Bay Special Protection Area for birds (SPA), and the Thanet Coast and Sandwich Bay Ramsar Site.Nature on the Map The southern emerald damselfly (Lestes barbarus) was found here in 2003, only the second site in Great Britain at which this vagrant species had occurred.Forrest, P. J. (2005) \\"Southern Emerald Damselfly Lestes barbarus (Fabr.) at Sandwich Bay, Kent\\", Atropos 24 pp. 24‚Äì25 There are several Geological Conservation Review sites within the SSSI. The bay is also home to the Sandwich Bay Bird Observatory TrustSandwich Bay Bird Observatory Trust and the Monk's Wall nature reserve. The sand dunes at the top of the beach give way to the private road leading through Sandwich Bay estate. There is a 24 hour toll on this road for non-resident motorists of ¬£7.00 per car or ¬£4.00 per motorcycle (2020) but cyclists and pedestrians pass for free. Charges apply 24 hours a day and you buy a ticket at the toll house, or online via the Sandwich Bay website when the toll house is closed. The bay closes to visitors half an hour after sun set and re-opens half an hour before sunrise. However, night fishing is allowed if a ticket is bought in advance. Security patrol the estate and seafront 24 hours a day. The road itself runs along on the top of a concealed sea wall separating the beach from the golf courses which back onto it. Via the toll road the beach is only 3‚Äì5 minutes from the historic Cinque port town of Sandwich. There are also scenic footpaths leading from the quay in Sandwich, along the river and over the golf course on the dunes to the bay, which can take anything from 30 minutes to 1 hour to walk. Cycling over this route is not advisable due to the length of the path situated upon the dunes and golf-course, but the road route takes only 10 minutes by bicycle. The beach at Sandwich Bay is largely shingle, and relatively steep in profile at points along its width, but the receding tide reveals some areas of sand. Towards the northern end of the beach Sandwich Bay is separated from the Isle of Thanet by the River Stour estuary, where the Pegwell Bay nature reserve and salt marsh can be found. The only facilities on the beach are a small toilet block and areas at the edges of the dunes for parking. Sandwich bay also has a sea wall, which has a road built on top to stop the waves from reaching the low-lying land behind. Every spring, beach replenishment is carried out, taking materials from the north of the bay, which has travelled up due to long shore drift, and is piled up against this wall to prevent any damage that may be caused by the waves.

The group is characterized by a specific shape to the lower jaw. In sciurognaths, the angular process of the jaw is in the same plane as the root of the incisors. This is in contrast to the suborder Hystricognathi where the angular process is outside the plane formed at the root of the incisor due to the presence of a shelf for muscle attachment. The sciurognathous condition is considered to be the primitive condition in rodents, and is therefore not a good character for cladistic analysis. Although hystricognaths are almost universally accepted as representing a real evolutionary grouping, most researchers do not consider Sciurognathi as an equally valid group. In particular, gundis are thought to be more closely related to the hystricognathous rodents than to other sciurognaths. In spite of this, most texts continue to use these two suborders due primarily to a lack of a viable alternative. Alternatively, some texts group rodents into three suborders on the basis of the shape of the infraorbital canal. According to this taxonomy the rodents are divided into the suborders Sciuromorpha, Hystricomorpha, and Myomorpha.

It is a capital of a gmina in the powiat of Lipsko, on the I≈Ç≈ºanka River, near Radom. In 1998 it had approximately 750 inhabitants and two minor construction materials plants. It lies approximately north-west of Lipsko and south of Warsaw. Ciepiel√≥w belongs to the historic province of Lesser Poland, and for centuries the village belonged to Sandomierz Voivodeship. It used to be a town from 1548 until 1870. History Ciepiel√≥w was founded by the Kazanowski family on the old trade route linking Sandomierz with Warsaw, at the ford at I≈Ç≈ºanka River, as the central point of their domain. Rotmistrz Marcin Kazanowski in 1548 was awarded by King Zygmunt August the right to grant the village with a city charter. In 1597 the town was granted with Magdeburg Law by Sigismund III Vasa and was allowed for creation of trade unions, which allowed it to become a notable centre of commerce in the area. However, before 1627 the town was totally destroyed by a major fire and Zygmunt Kazanowski relocated the city around that date. The town was also granted with a royal privilege of organization of markets once a week and fairs four times a year. In addition, Ciepiel√≥w was freed of all taxes and fees for 20 years, which allowed for a faster reconstruction. Around 1770 Ciepiel√≥w was purchased by the Denhoff family and by 1780 it was transferred to J√≥zef Karczewski, starost of Liw. Until 1869 the town had city rights and was a minor centre of trade and commerce in the area. However, the city charter was withdrawn as a repression against local inhabitants who took part in the failed January Uprising against Russia. On September 8, 1939, after the Invasion of Poland, the village of DƒÖbrowa (near Ciepiel√≥w) was the site of a mass murder of approximately 300 Polish prisoners of war by German Wehrmacht troops. In December 1941, a minor ghetto was established in Ciepiel√≥w by German authorities; in October 1942 all of them (approximately 600) of them were sent to gas chambers of Treblinka extermination camp. On December, 6, 1942, in nearby villages Stary Ciepiel√≥w and Rek√≥wka thirty-one Poles, among them women and children, were murdered for helping Jews. Also, two Jewish refugees were among the victims.

It was founded in 1848 by the Brothers of the Christian Schools. The school was first named Saint Vincent's School when it opened on Canal Street. It moved to Second Avenue in 1856 and changed its name to La Salle Academy in 1887. In 2010 La Salle relocated to 215 East 6th Street, sharing the building with St. George Ukrainian Catholic School. Various offices are still located in the Second Street building. Throughout its history, La Salle has been home to thousands of \\"Brothers' boys\\". Early years La Salle Academy was founded in 1848 when John Hughes, then Bishop of New York, invited the Christian Brothers to establish a school in the city. They opened St. Vincent's School in a church basement on Canal Street. In 1856, St. Vincent's School moved to East Second Street and Second Avenue, a plot of land that once belonged to Washington Irving. The brothers renamed the school La Salle Academy in 1887. The New York State Board of Regents granted La Salle a charter in 1896. In 1936, the brothers built a five-story building in order to accommodate increasing enrollment. Over the first half of the 20th century, La Salle Academy's enrollment grew immensely, from 98 in 1906 to 950 in 1948. Later 20th century In 1966 the school purchased the Moskowitz and Lupowitz Restaurant on the corner of Second Avenue and 2nd Street. This became the school's annex that housed the Guidance Department, the Academic Support Center, the Art Department, Drama Club activities, Music Department and more classrooms. Today, the annex currently houses the offices of the President, Development, Recruitment & Admissions and the Christian Brothers' residential community. In 1997, La Salle received accreditation from the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools and in 1998 celebrated its 150th Anniversary. In 2000, La Salle was named a Blue Ribbon School by the U.S. Department of Education for excellence in education. La Salle received an ‚Äúexceeding national expectations‚Äù evaluation in its 2018 report in fall 2017, followed by a Certificate of Accreditation in May 2018 from the from the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools on Elementary and Secondary Schools accreditation team. On assessing the school‚Äôs Catholic charism, La Salle Academy was blessed to have been given an exceptionally positive review (‚Äúwith commendation‚Äù) by the Christian Brothers of the District of Eastern North America. Dr. Catherine Guerriero became La Salle's first female President in 2014. Notable alumni Both Patrick Hayes and George Mundelein graduated from La Salle Academy in 1887 and became the Archbishops of New York and Chicago, respectively.

She was arrested by the military government for her involvement in Peronist movements. In Rosario she met the local singer and composer Fito P√°ez, who convinced her of abandoning her teaching career and become a professional singer. P√°ez was the producer of Herrero's first record, in 1987. This album was also the first that P√°ez produced. Its music was what they called \\"supermodern folklore\\". In 1989 P√°ez also produced Herrero's second album.

In 2005, she was awarded the GE / Science Young Scientist Award for her breakthrough in understanding the mechanism of spliceosomes - \\"akin to finding the Holy Grail of the splicing catalysis field\\" \\\\- a critical area of research, given that \\"20 percent or 30 percent of all human genetic diseases are caused by mistakes that the spliceosome makes\\".  Education  Valadkhan qualified as a medical doctor at Tehran University of Medial Sciences in Iran in 1996. She moved to America to pursue her Ph.D. at Columbia University, New York. In 2004, she joined as an Assistant Professor Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio.  Doctoral Research  Valadkhan studied the role of small nuclear RNAs in the human spliceosome under the supervision of Prof. James Manley. The main focus of her research is elucidating the structure and function of the catalytic core of the spliceosome by taking advantage of a novel, minimal spliceosome she recently developed. This minimal system, which consists of only two spliceosomal snRNAs, catalyzes a reaction identical to the splicing reaction. In addition to providing direct evidence for RNA catalysis in the spliceosome, and thus, settling the longstanding and central question of the identity of the catalytic domain, the minimal system provides a novel and powerful tool for studying the structure and function of the spliceosome.  Awards and Honours  Valadkhan was presented with the Harold Weintraub award from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle for her doctoral thesis. She was named a Searle Scholar in 2004. She was also awarded the American Association for Advancement of Science (AAAS) Young Scientist Grand Prize in the same year. In 2006, she became a founding member of the Rosalind Franklin Society. She was also honoured with the Nsoroma Award from Cleveland Chapter of the National Technical Association in 2006.

Concept  The Alice City concept was proposed as early as 1989. One of what would ideally be several linked Alice Cities, it would be split into three primary sectors- Town Space, Office Space, and Infrastructure Space, accessed by underground railway from a hub, called the Alice Terminal. = Town Space = The Town Space would consist of \\"verdant underground boulevards\\", free of traffic and containing shopping plazas, fitness centers, and theaters in addition to residences. = Office Space = The Office Space would house office buildings, hotels, parking lots, and expanded shops. \\"Solar domes\\" above office complexes would be in an effort to combat claustrophobia. Hotels and offices would be connected to the surface through the use of express elevators, allowing people to commute from outside the Alice City. = Infrastructure Space = The Infrastructure Space would handle utilities, such as power generation, heating, and sewage treatment. = Alice Terminal = Considered the hub of the city, Alice Terminal would be a 120-meter wide clear dome, 180 meters below the ground. Several railway links would lead out from the terminal to other complexes, and the terminal itself would be landscaped with parks and green space, as well as containing medical facilities, shopping centers, and other amenities for convenience.  Advantages  Many advantages were cited for the plan, primarily the fact that moving infrastructure, primarily industry, offices, and shops underground would free up large amounts of space above ground for redevelopment into parks and green space. The effects of earthquakes also be greatly reduced underground, diminishing to 1/3 to 1/7 their original levels at only 30 meters below ground. The need for heating would also be diminished, due to temperatures underground holding at a stable 13-15 C.  Disadvantages  A primary issue in development of underground cities is that in the event of a fire or similar disaster, it would be difficult if not impossible to evacuate everyone inside, requiring the construction of separate areas with independent supplies of power and air. Issues of land ownership also trouble the development of projects such as Alice City, due to Japanese law at the time of proposal considering land underground owned by the same body that owns the property above ground.

Grease generally consists of a soap emulsified with mineral or vegetable oil. The characteristic feature of greases is that they possess a high initial viscosity, which upon the application of shear, drops to give the effect of an oil-lubricated bearing of approximately the same viscosity as the base oil used in the grease. This change in viscosity is called shear thinning. Grease is sometimes used to describe lubricating materials that are simply soft solids or high viscosity liquids, but these materials do not exhibit the shear-thinning properties characteristic of the classical grease. For example, petroleum jellies such as Vaseline are not generally classified as greases. Greases are applied to mechanisms that can be lubricated only infrequently and where a lubricating oil would not stay in position. They also act as sealants to prevent ingress of water and incompressible materials. Grease-lubricated bearings have greater frictional characteristics because of their high viscosity. Properties Grease Worker, 3D-Model. A true grease consists of an oil and/or other fluid lubricant that is mixed with a thickener, typically a soap, to form a solid or semisolid. Greases are a type of shear-thinning or pseudo-plastic fluid, which means that the viscosity of the fluid is reduced under shear. After sufficient force to shear the grease has been applied, the viscosity drops and approaches that of the base lubricant, such as the mineral oil. This sudden drop in shear force means that grease is considered a plastic fluid, and the reduction of shear force with time makes it thixotropic. It is often applied using a grease gun, which applies the grease to the part being lubricated under pressure, forcing the solid grease into the spaces in the part. Melting point of Grease is 350¬∞C to 400¬∞C =Thickeners= An inverse micelle formed when a soap is dispersed in an oil. This structure is broken reversibly upon shearing the grease.Soaps are the most common emulsifying agent used, and the selection of the type of soap is determined by the application. Soaps include calcium stearate, sodium stearate, lithium stearate, as well as mixtures of these components. Fatty acids derivatives other than stearates are also used, especially lithium 12-hydroxystearate. The nature of the soaps influences the temperature resistance (relating to the viscosity), water resistance, and chemical stability of the resulting grease. =Powdered solid greases= Powdered solids may also be used as thickeners, especially as clays, which are used in some inexpensive, low performance greases. Fatty oil-based greases have also been prepared with other thickeners, such as tar, graphite, or mica, which also increase the durability of the grease. =Engineering assessment and analysis= Lithium-based greases are the most commonly used; sodium and lithium-based greases have higher melting point (dropping point) than calcium- based greases but are not resistant to the action of water. Lithium-based grease has a dropping point at 190 to 220 ¬∞C (350 to 400 ¬∞F). However the maximum usable temperature for lithium-based grease is 120 ¬∞C. The amount of grease in a sample can be determined in a laboratory by extraction with a solvent followed by e.g. gravimetric determination.Use of ozone depleting substances in laboratories. TemaNord 2003:516. =Additives= Gear greases consist of rosin oil, condensed with lime and stirred with mineral oil, with some percentage of water. Special-purpose greases contain glycerol and sorbitan esters. They are used, for example, in low-temperature conditions. Some greases are labeled \\"EP\\", which indicates \\"extreme pressure\\". Under high pressure or shock loading, normal grease can be compressed to the extent that the greased parts come into physical contact, causing friction and wear. EP grease contains solid lubricants, usually graphite and/or molybdenum disulfide, to provide protection under heavy loadings. The solid lubricants bond to the surface of the metal, and prevent metal-to-metal contact and the resulting friction and wear when the lubricant film gets too thin. Solid additives such as copper or ceramic powder are added to some greases for static high pressure and/or high temperature applications, or where corrosion could prevent dis-assembly of components later in their service life. These compounds are working as a release agent. Solid additives cannot be used in bearings because of tight tolerances. Solid additives will cause increased wear in bearings. History Grease from the early Egyptian or Roman eras is thought to have been prepared by combining lime with olive oil. The lime saponifies some of the triglyceride that comprises oil to give a calcium grease. In the middle of the 19th century, soaps were intentionally added as thickeners to oils.Thorsten Bartels et al. \\"Lubricants and Lubrication\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2005, Weinheim. Over the centuries, all manner of materials have been employed as greases. For example, black slugs Arion ater were used as axle-grease to lubricate wooden axle-trees or carts in Sweden. Classification and standards Red wheel bearing grease for automotive applications. Jointly developed by ASTM International, the National Lubricating Grease Institute (NLGI) and SAE International, standard ‚Äústandard classification and specification for automotive service greases‚Äù was first published in 1989 by ASTM International. It categorizes greases suitable for the lubrication of chassis components and wheel bearings of vehicles, based on performance requirements, using codes adopted from the NLGI's ‚Äúchassis and wheel bearing service classification system‚Äù: *LA and LB: chassis lubricants (suitability up to mild and severe duty respectively) *GA, GB and GC: wheel-bearings (suitability up to mild, moderate and severe duty respectively) A given performance category may include greases of different consistencies. The measure of the consistency of grease is commonly expressed by its NLGI consistency number. The main elements of standard and NLGI's consistency classification are reproduced and described in standard ‚Äúautomotive lubricating greases‚Äù published by SAE International. Standard ‚Äúlubricants, industrial oils and related products (class L) ‚Äî classification ‚Äî part 9: family X (greases)‚Äù, first released in 1987 by the International Organization for Standardization, establishes a detailed classification of greases used for the lubrication of equipment, components of machines, vehicles, etc. It assigns a single multi-part code to each grease based on its operational properties (including temperature range, effects of water, load, etc.) and its NLGI consistency number. Other types =Silicone grease= Silicone grease is an amorphous fumed-silica thickened, polysiloxane-based compound, which can be used to provide lubrication and corrosion resistance. Since it is not oil-based, it is often used where oil-based lubricants would attack rubber seals. Silicone greases also maintain stability under high temperatures. They are often used, in pure form or mixed with zinc oxide, to join heat sinks to computer CPUs. =Fluoroether-based grease= Fluoropolymers containing C-O-C (ether) with fluorine (F) bonded to the carbon. They are more flexible and often used in demanding environments due to their inertness. Fomblin by Solvay Solexis and Krytox by duPont are prominent examples. =Laboratory grease= Grease is used to lubricate glass stopcocks and joints. Some laboratories fill them into syringes for easy application. Two typical examples: Left - Krytox, a fluoroether-based grease; Right - a silicone-based high vacuum grease by Dow Corning. Apiezon, silicone-based, and fluoroether-based greases are all used commonly in laboratories for lubricating stopcocks and ground glass joints. The grease helps to prevent joints from \\"freezing\\", as well as ensuring high vacuum systems are properly sealed. Apiezon or similar hydrocarbon based greases are the cheapest, and most suitable for high vacuum applications. However, they dissolve in many organic solvents. This quality makes clean-up with pentane or hexanes trivial, but also easily leads to contamination of reaction mixtures. Silicone-based greases are cheaper than fluoroether-based greases. They are relatively inert and generally do not affect reactions, though reaction mixtures often get contaminated (detected through NMR near Œ¥ 0). Silicone-based greases are not easily removed with solvent, but they are removed efficiently by soaking in a base bath. Fluoroether-based greases are inert to many substances including solvents, acids, bases, and oxidizers. They are, however, expensive, and are not easily cleaned away. =Food-grade grease= Food-grade greases are those greases that come in contact with food. Food-grade lubricant base oil are generally low sulfur petrochemical, less easily oxidized and emulsified. Another commonly used poly-Œ± olefin base oil as well The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has three food-grade designations: H1, H2 and H3. H1 lubricants are food-grade lubricants used in food-processing environments where there is the possibility of incidental food contact. H2 lubricants are industrial lubricants used on equipment and machine parts in locations with no possibility of contact. H3 lubricants are food-grade lubricants, typically edible oils, used to prevent rust on hooks, trolleys and similar equipment. =Water-soluble grease analogs= In some cases, the lubrication and high viscosity of a grease are desired in situations where non-toxic, non-oil based materials are required. Carboxymethyl cellulose, or CMC, is one popular material used to create a water-based analog of greases. CMC serves to both thicken the solution and add a lubricating effect, and often silicone-based lubricants are added for additional lubrication. The most familiar example of this type of lubricant, used as a surgical and personal lubricant, is K-Y Jelly. =Cork grease= Cork grease is a lubricant used to lubricate cork, for example in musical wind instruments. It is usually applied using small lip-balm/lip-stick like applicators.

For a time, Miguel and his fellow Avenger Quasar manned a deep-space monitoring station. Their powers enabled them to travel back and forth to Earth without difficulty. Miguel took advantage of the isolation to study.Avengers (3rd series) #48 The Great Lakes Avengers (GLA) invited Miguel Santos in order to recruit him in their team. During the meeting, he turned them down, explaining that he'd attended thinking the team's acronym GLA referred to the Gay/Lesbian Alliance. With his explanation, he inadvertently revealed that he was gay to GLA member Flatman.GLA #2 During the Civil War storyline, Miguel joined Captain America's Secret Avengers as one of twenty new members who opposed the Superhuman Registration Act. He worked with the team out of a series of safe houses set up by Nick Fury. He was part of the final battle between the two main sides.

Living Lightning has the ability to transform his body into electrical plasma, in which form he can fly at sub-light speed, generate electrical power as shocks or bolts, and surround himself with a protective electrical force field. He has the ability to control his body while composed of electrical plasma, at which time his mind exists only in astral form. In his true form, Living Lightning is just that, a sentient electrical force with no mass. In this form, he can fly, reaching sub-light speeds, withstanding the vacuum of space, and is impervious to most physical and energy attacks. He also possesses the ability to fire and manipulate bursts of electricity and electrical fields of varying intensities in his solid form, however, he must wear a special containment suit to retain a solid form. Miguel has knowledge of basic street- fighting techniques. He is bilingual in Spanish and English.

Early life Garbett was born in the village of Tongham in Surrey, next to Aldershot in Hampshire, the son of Rev Charles Garbett, the vicar of Tongham. At the age of 11, he was sent to Portsmouth Grammar School and then to Keble College, Oxford, in 1894. After this, he went to Cuddesdon Theological College to study theology and prepare for ordination. Ordained Ministry Garbett was ordained in 1899 as a deacon\\"The Clergy List, Clerical Guide and Ecclesiastical Directory\\" London, John Phillips, 1900 and was sent to be a curate of St Mary's Portsea, where he was ordained to the priesthood in 1901 and remained until 1919, after 1909 as its vicar.

The Times (London, England), Monday, 23 February 1942; pg. 5; Issue 49167 =Archbishop of York= Garbett was a popular public figure, especially as a pastoral bishop, famous for trudging the length of his dioceses with his walking stick, visiting both clergy and lay people in the towns he passed through. Although personally warm, he had a reputation as a firm disciplinarian with clergy in his dioceses. Politically and theologically, he is best seen as a transitional figure between the Edwardian and modern periods of the Church of England. A staunch nationalist and royalist, he held an erastian view of the Church of England clearly as a national church, and he held strongly traditional views of issues such as family relationships, sexual morality, and corporal punishment. On the other hand, Garbett belonged to the generation which was comfortable with the idea of diversity in the Church of England and had little patience for High Church versus Low Church struggles. He was a pioneer of the Ecumenical Movement and, during and after the Second World War, travelled extensively, including to Communist Bloc countries. Although generally perceived as leaning rightwards politically, he was comfortable with the welfare state which emerged during his archiepiscopate.

However, during the Cold War, Garbett denounced Communism as un-Christian and actively supported the British government line. On 17 April 1944, Garbett appeared on the cover of TIME magazine after he had been persuaded by the British Ministry of Information to go to the United States to discuss religious freedom in Russia. During this visit, he said that \\"Marshal Stalin, being a great statesman, has recognised the power of religion.\\" Kent, Bruce Review of Church, State and Propaganda: The Archbishop of York and International Relations ‚Äì a policy study of Cyril Forster Garbett, 1942‚Äì1955 University of Hull Press (1999) Garbett's visit to Dublin, where he met President De Valera, was considered significant. Garbett sat in the House of Lords for many years as a Lord Spiritual and, as an erastian, he took his duties very seriously. In a notable statement made to the House of Lords in 1942, Garbett denounced Nazi Germany's extermination of Polish Jews, calling it \\"the deliberate and cold-blooded massacre of a nation.\\" Hansard, House of Lords Debates, 9 December 1942, vol. 125, cc485-486. On his retirement, Garbett was offered and accepted a hereditary barony, but he died before this could be legally created. It is thought he was to take the title Baron Garbett of Tongham. Final years Garbett continued to work into his late seventies, which eventually took its toll. He baptised Princess Anne, the second child and only daughter of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip on 21 October 1950 in the Music Room at Buckingham Palace. In 1953 he established The Queen's School in Jamaica in dedication to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. On his eightieth birthday, 6 February 1955, he retired from active ministry and was created a Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order. Later that year, he underwent surgery and spent the last months of his life in a convalescent home where he continued to write and correspond until his death, on 31 December 1955.

It is caused by the bacterium Clostridium septicum. Braxy generally occurs in winter, when sheep eat frosted root crops, or frosted grass. The frozen feed damages the mucosa (lining) of the abomasum, allowing C. septicum to enter, causing abomasitis and a fatal bacteremia. Young sheep not protected with a vaccine are most commonly affected. If sheep are not found dead, signs include abdominal pain and recumbency. There is no treatment, and sheep usually die within 36 hours of the onset of signs. The carcass of sheep which died of braxy will often decompose more rapidly than expected. Historically, the mutton of affected sheep was also referred to as braxy. A vaccine against braxy was developed at the Moredun Research Institute in Scotland. Braxy has been reported in Europe (particularly in Iceland, Norway and the UK), Australia and the United States.

Betuel. It followed on heels of other teen sci- fi/comedy films released the same year, such as Back to the Future, Real Genius, and Weird Science, though it did not perform as well as those films. Plot In 1957, the United States military secures a crashed UFO in a hangar bay. President Dwight D. Eisenhower (Robert Beer) enters to see the craft and simply orders his men to \\"get rid of it\\". In 1985, a high school senior named Michael Harlan (John Stockwell), whose only interest is muscle cars, reluctantly searches for something to turn in for his science class project final. While on what his bookworm friend Ellie Sawyer (Danielle von Zerneck) thinks is a date, Michael breaks into a government aircraft boneyard and stumbles upon a hidden fallout shelter. There, he finds a glowing, plasma globe-like piece of scientific equipment and grabs it just as a military guard approaches and chases him away. The next day, Michael cleans up the device in auto shop class and unwittingly activates it, causing it to leech power from a nearby boombox. His friend, Vince Latello (Fisher Stevens), tries to talk him out of attaching the device to an automotive battery, whereupon the device emits a swirl of colorful energy that manifests into an Ancient Greek vase as the battery melts. The two leave the auto shop for their next class, but soon realize they inexplicably lost two hours of time and missed their final science exam. After more strange occurrences with the machine, Michael takes the device, referred to as \\"the gizmo\\", to his ex-hippie science teacher Dr. Roberts (Dennis Hopper). Believing it is a portal to another dimension, he plugs it into an electrical outlet. While bathing in the cosmic energy of the gizmo and contemplating the wonders of the universe, Roberts suddenly disappears, leaving behind his peace symbol medallion. Michael is unable to disconnect the machine from the outlet and decides his only solution is to destroy the power lines leading to town. Michael and Vince obtain dynamite from the backroom of a hardware store owned by Michael's father (Barry Corbin), and race to outrun a wave of energy traveling along the lines before it reaches the local power plant. They blow up a tower, stopping the wave and causing a blackout, but upon returning to town are arrested for Dr. Roberts' disappearance. Michael calls Ellie and asks her to go to the school to retrieve the gizmo, hoping to prove his innocence by showing it to the police. At the school, she runs into Sherman (Raphael Sbarge), an obnoxious nerd, who hooks the gizmo up to the outlet again, creating a massive time warp over the school and causing a blackout in town, allowing Vince and Michael to escape the police. Returning to the school, they find the whole building consumed in a vortex of space/time as objects and people from the past and future manifest around them and a crazed Sherman, who fears the world is ending and tells them that Ellie is in danger. Dragging Sherman along, Mike and Vince grab weapons from a platoon of fallen Vietnam War soldiers and make their way to the science lab, battling a T-rex in the gymnasium and a mob of post-apocalypse mutants along the way. They reach Ellie and successfully deactivate the gizmo, causing time to return to normal just as emergency crews and police show up. Moments later, Dr. Roberts reappears, rejoicing in an unexpected trip to Woodstock, and proudly gives Michael an \\"A\\" grade on his science project under the condition that he gets rid of the machine, saying it's not something mankind is ready for. Roberts is then arrested by the local sheriff (Richard Masur), who thinks he blew up the power lines - as Michael had accidentally left Robert's peace medallion at the hardware store. As promised, Michael returns the gizmo back to the junkyard where he found it. On the way back, the car runs out of gas and he and Ellie leave it by the side of the road; in contrast to his previous devotion to it, he says \\"It's just a car.\\" Foreign release The distributors of the movie in Sweden thought it should be marketed as a mix of Ghostbusters and Back to the Future. It was subsequently renamed TimeBusters. Reception The film currently holds a rating of 13% on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 8 reviews. New York Times critic Stephen Holden wrote on August 10, 1985; \\"My Science Project is a cheerful teen-age adventure film that in its snappier moments resembles a far less clever and less expensive Back to the Future. Despite a plot that has few interesting twists and a shoestring budget, the film glimmers with moments of drollery.\\" =Box office= The film was not a success. On its first weekend, it only peaked at #14 with $1,504,118, averaging $1,499 per theater. It ended grossing $4,122,748 in domestic box-office in its two-week run.

Biography  Ferdinand was born in Almeirim on 17 November 1433, and died in Set√∫bal on 18 September 1470. He was twice sworn Prince of Portugal (title granted to the presumptive heir to the throne): first between 1438 and 1451, once his older brother became king Afonso V of Portugal and had no children; and for the second time, in 1451, when Prince Jo√£o was born, but died months later. When Afonso V's first daughter, Princess Joan, was born (1452), Infante Ferdinand finally lost this title. In 1452, Ferdinand fled the country looking for adventure. Some say he wanted to go to the north African cities controlled by the Portuguese; others say that he wanted to join his uncle, the King Alfonso I of Naples, in his campaigns in southern Italy. It seems Ferdinand had the hope to inherit his uncle's kingdom, as he had no legitimate children. Ferdinand in a 1534 miniature in the Genealogy of D. Manuel Pereira, 3rd Count of Feira. However, his brother, King Afonso V of Portugal, as soon as he knew about Ferdinand‚Äôs escape, ordered to the Count of Odemira, which was patrolling the strait of Gibraltar with a fleet, to intercept the infante ship and bring him back to mainland Portugal. =Duke of Beja and Viseu= In 1453, his brother, King Afonso V of Portugal granted him the title of 1st Duke of Beja. When his uncle, Prince Henry the Navigator died, in 1460, he also became 2nd Duke of Viseu as well. He also succeeded his uncle as Master of the Order of Christ and responsible for the Discoveries (1460‚Äì1470). He was finally allowed to fight in north Africa: first in 1458 he escorted the king to the conquest of the Moroccan city of Alc√°cer Ceguer; and for a second time, in 1468, he led a Portuguese fleet that conquered and destroyed the port of Anfa (Anaf√© in Portuguese), today included in Casablanca, which was a barbary corsairs base. He was buried in the Religiosas da Concei√ß√£o monastery, in Beja, founded by his wife. =Marriage and children= He married his cousin Beatrice of Portugal (Portuguese: Beatriz) in 1447, daughter of Infante Jo√£o, Lord of Reguengos (his uncle). From this marriage, Ferdinand had nine children: * Infante Jo√£o (1448‚Äì1472), 3rd Duke of Viseu, 2nd Duke of Beja, 7th Constable of Portugal. * Infante Diogo (1450‚Äì1484), 4th Duke of Viseu, 3rd Duke of Beja; * Infanta Eleanor of Viseu (1458‚Äì1525), married to King John II of Portugal, becoming Queen of Portugal; * Infanta Isabella of Viseu (1459‚Äì1521), married to Ferdinand II, Duke of Braganza; * Infante Duarte of Viseu (1462-died in childhood); * Infante Dinis of Viseu (1464- died in childhood); * Infante Sim√£o of Viseu (1467-died in childhood); * Infante Manuel (1469-1521), 5th Duke of Viseu, 4th Duke of Beja.

It includes all members of the Sciuridae (the squirrel family) as well as the mountain beaver species. Traditionally, the term has been defined on the basis of the shape of the infraorbital canal. A sciuromorphous zygomasseteric system is characterized by attachment of the lateral masseter muscle along the side of the rostrum. Unlike hystricomorphous and myomorphous rodents, the medial masseter muscle does not pass through the infraorbital canal. Among extant rodents, only the families Sciuridae, Castoridae, Heteromyidae, and Geomyidae are truly sciuromorphous. Some authorities would exclude the Geomyidae and Heteromyidae from that list due to the attachment of the medial masseter directly behind the zygomatic arch. Skull of an oriental giant squirrel displaying a sciuromorphous zygomatic system Carleton and Musser (2005) redefined the rodent suborders on morphological and molecular grounds. They defined the Sciuromorpha as including three families, Sciuridae, Aplodontiidae, and Gliridae. Of these, only the Sciuridae are truly sciuromorphous. The Aplodontiidae are protrogomorphous and the Gliridae are myomorphous. The connection between Aplodontiidae and Sciuridae has been proposed numerous times in the past. The two families have been united into a common infraorder (Sciurida) or superfamily (Sciuroidea). It has long been suggested that dormice (Gliridae) are not particularly related to the Myomorpha, and their zygomasseteric structure has been termed \\"pseudomyomorphy\\". The connection between squirrels and dormice has been almost exclusively suggested through genetic studies, and to a lesser degree via the fossil rodent Reithroparamys.

Big Brother  Song entered the Big Brother house in 2003 for the 4th season of the show. She was one of the five houseguests to have an ex, Jee Choe, enter the house as an antagonist. Throughout the game, Song used her relationship with Choe to further herself in the game. Midway through the game, Song formed an alliance with her rival Alison Irwin. Jun Song recognized, reacted, and responded well to the challenges of the Big Brother game. Although by no means liked by her housemates, Jun was complimented for having acute strategy and subtly commanding control over the game. She is often credited as the houseguest to have invented the \\"floater\\" strategy. On day 1, Song was one of the first eight people to enter the house. After being informed of the twist, Song and her housemates formed the Elite Eight alliance and vowed to play against the other five houseguests, labeled \\"the exes\\". On day 27, Head of Household Alison Irwin nominated Song for eviction for the first time. She was nominated alongside Dana Varela, Jun's closest ally and friend, to prevent the possibility of her winning the veto and then using it on Varela. On day 33, Song survived eviction and Varela was unanimously evicted. On day 43, Song won the Power of Veto and did not use it, securing Head of Household Erika Landin's plan to evict Justin Giovinco, the houseguest they viewed as the biggest threat in the game. In week 7, Song and Irwin formed an alliance to go to the final two together. Their first decision as an alliance was to vote to evict Jack Owens and take Landin to the final three with them. In week 8, Song became Head of Household for the first time. As HOH, Song won a special trip outside of the Big Brother house to attend the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards. Her disappearance from the house played a part in the Veto competition, which was held before nominations for a second time that season, as the houseguests had to guess where Song was. At her return, Song nominated her ex, Jee Choe, and strategically put up her ally and POV holder, Irwin, alongside Choe to prevent Irwin from potentially using the POV to save either nominee, as well as to hide their alliance. On day 61, Irwin Vetoed herself and Robert Roman was named the replacement nominee. By a 2-0 vote, Choe was unanimously evicted from the house. In week 9, Song was nominated for eviction for a second time by Head of Household Robert Roman. She was initially nominated alongside Irwin, however Irwin saved herself by winning the Diamond Power of Veto. Landin then automatically became the replacement nominee and, as DPOV holder, Irwin cast the sole eviction vote that week and evicted Landin. In week 10, Song competed against Roman in the second part of the final HOH competition and won, advancing to the third part of the competition in which she faced off against Irwin. The challenge came down to a tiebreaker, which Song purposely threw so that Irwin could become the last HOH and be the one to evict Roman and at the same time lose his jury vote. On day 82, during the live finale, Song was declared the winner of the show in a 6-1 jury vote. Song's votes came from Dana Varela, Justin Giovinco, Jack Owens, Erika Landin, Robert Roman, and her ex-boyfriend Jee Choe. Post-Big Brother, Song appeared in an episode of the CBS sitcom Yes, Dear as herself in a special Big Brother themed episode. Personal life Prior to the show, Song worked in product development at an investment bank in New York, NY. Jun took a personal leave of absence to enter the Big Brother 4 house. After winning Big Brother, Song found out her father was in a coma. He died shortly thereafter. While vacationing in the Dominican Republic she met Belgian Davy Goethals. Goethals is a longshoreman at the Port Of Ghent. By the end of their trip their talks were so passionate that they began dating long distance. Just six months later, on December 21, 2010, the couple married in New York City. The couple lived in Ghent, Belgium. Song has one child, a boy, Noah. On May 1, 2014, she opened a Korean eatery called Rice House in her town of Evergem in East Flanders, Belgium. In 2017, she left her husband but has yet to go public as to the reason for their divorce. She then closed her restaurant shortly thereafter and picked up her writing career. Since April, 2018, she‚Äôs been working at a software startup. Song occasionally watches Big Brother (U.S.) and continues to comment about the show on her own blog, JunDishes.com. In 2013, she wrote a scathing letter to Julie Chen, host of the show, criticizing Chen for her approach to the issues of racism in Big Brother 15.

It is commonly found in South Africa. It is very rich in vitamin B. The beer has a rather low alcohol content (usually less than 3%) and is known to have a heavy and distinctly sour aroma. In appearance, the beer is opaque and light tan in colour. It has a thick, creamy and gritty consistency (from the maize). Umqombothi is cheaper than commercial lager beers brewed from barley and flavoured with hops flowers. Traditional method of preparation Umqombothi is brewed following traditional customs and these vary slightly between regions. The recipe is often passed down through the generations. The beer is traditionally prepared over a fire outside of the house. It then passively cools to ambient temperatures outside the house. The ingredients used are: equal measures of maize meal, crushed mealie malt (corn malt) and crushed sorghum malt. The maize malt provides a lighter-toned beer with a mellower flavour. The sorghum malt provides a darker beer. The ingredients are mixed in a cast-iron pot, known as a potjie in South Africa. Four measures of warm water are added. The mixture is left overnight. The mixture starts fermenting and bubbles appear. A sour odour can be detected. A small portion of the wort is removed and put to one side. The remaining mash is cooked until a crusty sediment forms. This product is known as isidudu and can be eaten as a porridge. When making beer, the isidudu is left to cool for a day. After the mixture has cooled, it is poured into a large plastic vat. The wort that was set aside is added to the vat. A handful of sorghum malt and a handful of maize malt is added to the vat. The brew is stirred with a traditional stirring spoon called an iphini. The vat is covered with a lid and blanket (to retain heat). The vat is put in a warm place overnight, to encourage fermentation. The traditional method of testing to see if the brew is ready is to light a match close to the vat. If the match blows out quickly, the brew is ready. If the match remains lit, the brew is not ready. This is because the fermenting mash produces large amounts of carbon dioxide, which does not allow for combustion of the match. When the brew is ready, the fermented mash is filtered through a large metal strainer, to remove the spent grains. The sediment at the bottom of the vat is known as intshela. The intshela is added to the strained beer, to give extra flavour. The spent grains are squeezed out and are usually cast onto the ground for chickens. The brewer of the beer traditionally gives thanks to the ancestors while casting the corn. Once the beer has been strained, it is poured into a large communal drum known as a gogogo. It is ready for sharing with friends and family. When guests arrive at the brewer's home to taste the beer and join in the celebration, they traditionally bring a bottle of brandy, as a symbol of gratitude. Umqombothi served in an ukhamba, zulu beer vessel at Cape Town, South Africa. Traditional uses Umqombothi is used to celebrate the home- coming of young men known as abakwetha in Xhosa culture, after ulwaluko - initiation and religious male circumcision. This beer plays a very important role when someone contacts their ancestors, the amadlozi, and plays a central role in the social context and so is often used during customary weddings, funerals, and imbizos (traditional meetings). Health concerns A recent study found sorghum and maize used as ingredients in umqombothi often are contaminated by mycotoxin-producing molds Aspergillus spp., Penicillium spp., Rhizopus spp. and Mucor spp. Although the finished beer is not contaminated with the fungi, 33% of commercially brewed sorghum beer contained aflatoxins and 45% of home-brewed beers contained zearalenone or ochratoxin A (or both) in the final product. The Eastern Cape province of South Africa has a very high incidence of esophageal cancer. Research by the South African Medical Research Council suggests mycotoxins in homegrown maize are linked to the high incidence of this cancer. In popular culture It is referred to in the song of the same name sung by Yvonne Chaka Chaka. The lyrics of the song call it a \\"magic African beer.\\" The song is heard in the opening of Hotel Rwanda. See also * Burukutu, Chibuku and Munkoyo or 'Ibwatu' in Zambia.

It stars Nick Nolte, Nigel Havers, Frank McRae, and Gerry Lopez and is loosely based on the 1969 novel L'Adieu au Roi by Pierre Schoendoerffer. Longtime Milius collaborator Basil Poledouris composed the musical score. Plot During World War II, American deserter Learoyd escapes a Japanese firing squad. Hiding in the wilds of Borneo, Learoyd is adopted by a head-hunting tribe of Dayaks, who consider him divine because of his blue eyes. Before long, Learoyd is the reigning king of the Dayaks. When British soldiers approach him to rejoin the war against the Japanese, Learoyd resists. When his own tribe is threatened by the invaders, Learoyd decides to fight for their rights and to protect their independence. Main cast * Nick Nolte as Learoyd * Nigel Havers as Captain Fairbourne * James Fox as Colonel Ferguson * Marilyn Tokuda as Yoo * Frank McRae as Sergeant Tenga * Aki Aleong as Colonel Mitamura * Marius Weyers as Sergeant Conklin * William Wise as Dynamite Dave * Gerry Lopez as Gwai * Elan Oberon as Vivienne * Choy Chang Wing as Lian * Richard Morgan as Stretch Lewis * John Bennett Perry as General Douglas MacArthur * Michael Nissman as General Sutherland * Wayne Pygram as Bren Armstrong Production =Original novel= Pierre Schoendoerffer originally wrote the story as a film script. He then turned it into a novel, which was published in 1969 and became a best seller in France, selling over 300,000 copies in hardback. He made the lead character Irish because \\"the Irish are mad and I like mad people.\\" \\"I was wanting to make a great symphonic book on life and death: on how a man can struggle until the very end, without hope and without reason, just to be alive, even though half dead., even though suffering terribly, because life is so powerful. But on the other hand I was wanting to show that if suddenly a man discovers that he is not fulfilling his dream, then he does not want to live anymore.\\" The story had some basis in historical fact - Tom Harrisson's stay with the Dayaks during the Second World War was the inspiration for much of what happened in the novel along with the allied drop behind Japanese lines known as Operation Semut. =Development= The film was originally going to be made in 1972, directed by Schoendoerffer and produced by Robert Dorfman, starring Donald Sutherland. However, it was not made. John Milius was interested in the themes of the book. In 1976, he said: \\"I liked the story because it was such a wonderful Kiplingesque adventure tale,\\" Milius later said. \\"It was a theme I always respond to, a guy living free in the wild, and the world catching up to him. In many ways it's similar to Jeremiah Johnson. I thought if I kept plugging away at it, sooner or later I'd get to do it.\\" Milius announced he would make the film in 1984. Milius described the film as his \\"most ambitious work - something I've wanted to do for 15 years... It's a story that explores loyalties, concepts of freedom and justice. And contrasts a seemingly violent but also very innocent society with the most corrupt society of them all, the outside world. \\"I have always wanted to write this story,\\" Milius added. \\"Learoyd is a character who could have come out of one of those barbershop magazines of the '50s: 'I fought the (Japanese) with the headhunters in Borneo where I was king.' He's sitting on a throne with sloe-eyed beauties all around‚Äîa mai tai in one hand, a Thompson submachine gun in the other. There is some sort of primitive appeal in that to all of us. But the studios were never very excited about it. I don't know if they are now.\\" \\"You wouldn't call \`Farewell to the King' a right-wing establishment movie, it's certainly not in favor of empire,\\" said Milius. \\"I think this movie is the most honest depiction of my politics. It's also hopelessly romantic: I'm just a romantic fool.\\" Nick Nolte was cast in the lead for a fee of $3 million. \\"Thirty years ago it would have been Robert Mitchum,\\" said Milius. \\"He was an average, proletarian man, not upper class. Leroyd was a slob in paradise. He was a deserter, troublemaker, a '30s labor organizer, the sort of loveable guy that had great ideals, much more than Nigel [Havers, who plays the botanist], who has all the refinement of culture and empire. He looks at this guy and realizes that he is a great man.\\" \\"I would say it's a film about loyalty and trust, freedom and justice,\\" said Nolte. \\"And it compares a savage but innocent society to the outside world which is the most corrupt society of all.\\" \\"I'm a story teller,\\" said Milius. \\"I'm a modern technology version of the Borneo tribal storyteller who squats near the fire in the long house and tells his tale. We're all telling the same tale. It's about the struggle of people to survive and, more important, to be free. It's about the necessity of making moral choices - and their costs. But it seems more real when you see where it really happened - and the people it really happened to. It's set in the 1940s and many people lost their freedom in the 1940s and were taking action and having adventures to get it back. Human beings like to hear stories about how they've survived and stayed free.\\" =Filming= Filming started 24 August 1987. The film was shot on location in Borneo (Bau, Kuching, Sarawak). Nolte arrived in Borneo a month before filming began.New York Times, 26 February 1989, H15: In the Wilds of Borneo, Legend Takes Root \\"We could have shot this film in the Philippines for a lot less money\\", he says. \\"But this is where it happened. These are the real people. These are real Iban. This is the land of Rajah Brooke. You know, the older I get, the more I feel I am like a Viking.\\" \\"This is a tough film, but you kind of like the toughness of it here\\", said Milius on location. \\"This is an adventure. If you're a romantic like me, you think of yourself out building the Panama Canal, or being the Rajah Brooke. You can't think of that if you're in a rainstorm in the San Fernando Valley.\\" Milius' then-girlfriend played Haver's fianc√©e. =Editing= Post-production was to be done in England but the falling US dollar meant that it was done in Los Angeles. According to Milius, the film was his best movie but it was \\"completely cut to pieces\\" by executives at the studio. In February 1989 he said, \\"Orion isn't behind it. They don't think it is going to be big at the box office. You put all the sweat and blood you can into it, and the outcome is whatever happens.\\" Milius would have liked to have been able to exceed the two-hour running time limit by 10 minutes, and preferred his silent action sequences accompanied by Basil Poledouris music over the release print's realistic, percussive sound effects. \\"The music was played down,\\" he said. \\"It was a beautiful score. The producers' attitude is: \`We paid for the gunshot, let's hear it.'\\" He was also unhappy the edit removed how Learoyd managed to unify the Dyak tribes by getting the women to hold a sex strike. He later said > [The film] was thrown away. I, as usual, was attacked viciously but in time > it's come to be regarded as one of my best. In a way - I don't know why - I > guess this film is more heartfelt than anything I've done since Big > Wednesday...

A wheel can be depicted in two dimensions using two circles. The larger circle is tangent to a horizontal surface (e.g. a road) that it can roll on. The smaller circle has the same center and is rigidly affixed to the larger one. The smaller circle could depict the bead of a tire, a rim the tire is mounted on, an axle, etc. Assume the larger circle rolls without slipping (or skidding) for a full revolution. The distances moved by both circles are the same length, as depicted by the blue and red dashed lines and the distance between the two black vertical lines. The distance for the larger circle equals its circumference, but the distance for the smaller circle is longer than its circumference: a paradox or problem. The paradox is not limited to a wheel. Other things depicted in two dimensions show the same behavior. A roll of tape does. A typical round bottle or jar rolled on its side does; the smaller circle depicting the mouth or neck of the bottle or jar. There are a few things that would be depicted with the brown horizontal line in the image tangent to the smaller circle rather than the larger one. Examples are a typical train wheel, which has a flange, or a barbell straddling a bench. Drabkin called these Case II and the kind in the image Case I. A similar but not identical analysis applies.  History of the paradox  = In antiquity = In antiquity, the wheel problem was described in the Aristotelian Mechanica, as well as in the Mechanica of Hero of Alexandria. In the former it appears as \\"Problem 24\\", where the description of the wheel is given as follows. > For let there be a larger circle ŒîZŒì a smaller EHB, and A at the centre of > both; let ZI be the line which the greater unrolls on its own, and HK that > which the smaller unrolls on its own, equal to ZŒõ. When I move the smaller > circle, I move the same centre, that is A; let the larger be attached to it. > When AB becomes perpendicular to HK, at the same time AŒì becomes > perpendicular to ZŒõ, so that it will always have completed an equal > distance, namely HK for the circumference HB, and ZŒõ for ZŒì. If the quarter > unrolls an equal distance, it is clear that the whole circle will unroll an > equal distance to the whole circle, so that when the line BH comes to K, the > circumference ZŒì will be ZŒõ, and the whole circle will be unrolled. In the > same way, when I move the large circle, fitting the small one to it, their > centre being the same, AB will be perpendicular and at right angles > simultaneously with AŒì, the latter to ZI, the former to HŒò. So that, when > the one will have completed a line equal to HŒò, and the other to ZI, and ZA > becomes again perpendicular to ZŒõ, and HA to HK, so that they will be as in > the beginning at Œò and I. The problem is then stated: > Now since there is no stopping of the greater for the smaller so that it > [the greater] remains for an interval of time at the same point, and since > the smaller does not leap over any point, it is strange that the greater > traverses a path equal to that of the smaller, and again that the smaller > traverses a path equal to that of the larger. Furthermore, it is remarkable > that, though in each case there is only one movement, the center that is > moved in one case rolls a great distance and in the other a smaller > distance. = In the Scientific Revolution = The mathematician Gerolamo Cardano discusses the problem of the wheel in his 1570 Opus novum de proportionibus numerorum, taking issue with the presumption of the analysis of the problem in terms of motion. Mersenne further discussed the wheel in his 1623 Quaestiones Celeberrimae in Genesim, where he suggests that the problem can be analysed by a process of expansion and contraction of the two circles. But Mersenne remained unsatisfied with his understanding, writing, > Indeed I have never been able to discover, and I do not think any one else > has been able to discover whether the smaller circle touches the same point > twice, or proceeds by leaps and sliding. In his Two New Sciences, Galileo uses the problem of the wheel to argue for a certain kind of atomism. Galileo begins his analysis by considering a pair of concentric hexagons, as opposed to a pair of circles. Imagining this hexagonal wheel \\"rolling\\" on a surface, Galileo notices that the inner hexagon \\"jumps\\" a little space, with each roll of the outer hexagon onto a new face. He then imagines what would happens in the limit as the number faces on the polygon becomes very large, and finds that the little space that is \\"jumped\\" by the inner polygon becomes smaller and smaller, writing: > Therefore a larger polygon having a thousand sides passes over and measures > a straight line equal to its perimeter, while at the same time the smaller > one passes an approximately equal line, but one interruptedly composed of a > thousand little particles equal to its thousand sides with a thousand little > void spaces interposed ‚Äî for we may call these \\"void\\" in relation to the > thousand linelets touched by the sides of the polygon. Since the circle is just the limit in which the number of faces on the polygon becomes infinite, Galileo finds that Aristotle's wheel contains material that is filled with infinitesimal spaces or \\"voids\\", and that \\"the interposed voids are not quantified, but are infinitely many\\". This leads Galileo to conclude that a belief in atoms, in the sense that matter is \\"composed of infinitely many unquantifiable atoms\\" is sufficient to solve the problem of the wheel. Gilles de Roberval (Personne)1602-1675 is also associated with this problem. = In the 19th century = Bernard Bolzano discussed Aristotle's wheel in The Paradoxes of the Infinite (1851), a book that influenced Georg Cantor and subsequent thinkers about the mathematics of infinity. Bolzano observes that there is a bijection between the points of any two similar arcs, which can be implemented by drawing a radius, remarking that the history of this apparently paradoxical fact goes back to Aristotle. = In the 20th century = The author of Mathematical Fallacies and Paradoxes uses a dime glued to a half- dollar with their centers aligned, both fixed to an axle, as a model for the paradox. The dime serves as the smaller circle and the half-dollar as the larger one. He writes: > This is the solution, then, or the key to it. Although you are careful not > to let the half-dollar slip on the tabletop, the ‚Äúpoint‚Äù tracing the line > segment at the foot of the dime is both rotating and slipping all the time. > It is slipping with respect to the tabletop. Since the dime does not touch > the table top, you do not notice the slipping. If you can roll the half- > dollar along the table and at the same time roll the dime (or better yet the > axle) along a block of wood, you can actually observe the slipping. If you > have ever parked too close to the curb, you have noticed the screech made by > your hubcap as it slips (and rolls) on the curb while your tire merely rolls > on the pavement. The smaller the small circle relative to the large circle, > the more the small one slips. Of course the center of the two circles does > not rotate at all, so it slides the whole way. Alternatively, one can reject the assumption that the smaller circle is independent of the larger circle. Imagine a tire as the larger circle, and imagine the smaller circle as the interior circumference of the tire and not as the rim. The movement of the inner circle is dependent on the larger circle. Thus its movement from any point to another can be calculated by using an inverse of their ratio.  Analysis and solutions  The paradox is that the smaller inner circle moves 2œÄR, the circumference of the larger outer circle with radius R, rather than its own circumference. If the inner circle were rolled separately, it would move 2œÄr, its own circumference with radius r. The inner circle is not separate but rigidly connected to the larger. So 2œÄr is a red herring. The inner circle's center is relevant, but its circumference is not. = First solution = If the smaller circle depends on the larger one (Case I), then the larger circle forces the smaller one to traverse the larger circle‚Äôs circumference. If the larger circle depends on the smaller one (Case II), then the smaller circle forces the larger one to traverse the smaller circle‚Äôs circumference. This is the simplest solution. = Second solution = This solution considers the transition from starting to ending positions. Let Pb be a point on the bigger circle and Ps be a point on the smaller circle, both on the same radius. For convenience, assume they are both directly below the center, analogous to both hands of a clock pointing towards six. Both Pb and Ps travel a cycloid path as they roll together one revolution. The two paths are pictured here: http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Cycloid.html and http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CurtateCycloid.html. While each travels 2œÄR horizontally from start to end, Ps's cycloid path is shorter and more efficient than Pb's. Pb travels farther above and farther below the center's path ‚Äì the only straight one ‚Äì than does Ps. The nearby image shows the circles before and after rolling one revolution. It shows the motions of the center, Pb, and Ps, with Pb and Ps starting and ending at the top of their circles. The green dash line is the center's motion. The blue dash curve shows Pb's motion. The red dash curve shows Ps's motion. Ps's path is clearly shorter than Pb's. The closer Ps is to the center, the shorter, more direct, and closer to the green line its path is. AristotleWheel If Pb and Ps were anywhere else on their respective circles, the curved paths would be the same length. Summarizing, the smaller circle moves horizontally 2œÄR because any point on the smaller circle travels a shorter, more direct path than any point on the larger circle. = Third solution = This solution only compares the starting and ending positions. The larger circle and the smaller circle have the same center. If said center is moved, both circles move the same distance, which is a necessary property of translation and equals 2œÄR in the experiment. Also, every other point on both circles has the same position relative to the center before and after rolling one revolution (or any other integer count of revolutions).

He graduated cum laude from New York University's Tisch School of the Arts. Willems first became interested in cartoon art when he was just a child. When he was 3 or 4 he started to draw and create his own characters. Willems enjoyed writing stories about his characters to share with others. However, he was disappointed when adults would praise his work out of politeness. To fix this dilemma Willems started writing funny stories. He knew that even polite adults could not fake a laugh. So when the adults laughed he knew his story was good and if the adults still gave polite comments then he knew his story was bad. Career After graduating from Tisch, Willems spent a year traveling around the world drawing a cartoon every day, all of which have been published in the book You Can Never Find a Rickshaw When it Monsoons. Returning to New York, he started his career as a writer and animator for Sesame Street, where he earned six Emmy Awards for writing during his tenure from 1993 to January 2002.Mo Willems' biography The segments he wrote and animated for the show including a series of short segments featuring the recurring character Susie Kabloozie, and her pet cat, Feff.

Career Cameron was born in 1924 at Osgoode, Ontario, the son of James W. Cameron and Euphemia Madden. Cameron represented the riding of York South. He had previously assisted the former Progressive Conservative Member of Parliament as his chief of staff for many years. Cameron served in the Royal Canadian Air Force during World War II. He was viewed by many of the more hardline CoR members as being too soft on the issues. The party's machine (President, Executive, Council) tried to overthrow him, but their attempts failed, and although they and the membership elected Brent Taylor as leader, Cameron was able to successfully argue that leadership convention was illegal. After a conflict with the former leader of the party Arch Pafford, Cameron had Pafford expelled from the party, along with those in the party machine who had opposed him. When he stepped down as leader, he was replaced with a candidate that was widely seen as part of the \\"Anti-Cameron\\" camp. Cameron did not run again in the 1995 election.

Synopsis The film follows a group of people in Birch County, California, a fictionalized city/county which is very similar to real-life Los Angeles, who, after being ticketed for numerous traffic violations, and as a result lose their licenses and driving privileges (and their vehicles impounded), are ordered by Judge Nedra Henderson (Sally Kellerman) to attend a driving course program in order to get their licenses and their vehicles back. However, the assigned teacher for this course, Deputy Henry \\"Hank\\" Halik (James Keach), is also conspiring with the judge in a plan to make sure these offenders fail miserably, and at any cost, so they can sell their impounded vehicles. Their actions make one of the offended individuals, landscaper Dana Cannon (John Murray), very suspicious of their scheme and he enlists his fellow students to expose the plot.

It contains apricot jam and has a spongy caramelized texture. A cream sauce is often poured over it while it is hot, and it is usually served hot with custard and/or ice- cream. Many South African restaurants offer it. The pudding gained popularity on the West Coast of the US after Oprah Winfrey's personal chef, Art Smith, served it for Christmas dinner in 2006 to the pupils of the Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy for Girls in South Africa. There are various theories on the origin of the name. *The Oxford English Dictionary says it comes from Afrikaans malvalekker, meaning \\"marshmallow\\" (ultimately from Latin malva, a mallow). This may arise from a resemblance between the pudding's texture and that of a marshmallow or a similar Afrikaner sweet, the malvelekker, made with the extract of marsh mallow. *Malva is also Afrikaans for geranium (in the broad sense, including Pelargonium). Another botanical theory is that the batter was originally flavoured with the leaves of the lemon- or the rose- scented geranium, varieties of South African native plants. *Art Smith said that according to Colin Cowie, his hospitality ambassador in South Africa, the pudding was named after a woman called Malva.Oprah and Malva Pudding * Another theory is that the sauce originally contained Malvasia (malmsey) wine. Proponents of this theory include brandy or sherry in the sauce. * Still others suggest that the pudding was originally accompanied by Malvasia wine. Jan Ellis Pudding is a variant. In 2019 making Malva pudding was set as a technical challenge for contestants of the TV baking contest Junior Bake Off by South African cookery writer Prue Leith.

There were nine tropical storms, of which five became hurricanes. Two of those strengthened into major hurricanes, which are Category 3 or higher on the modern day Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale. The first system was initially observed in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico on June 26\\\\. The tenth and final system dissipated near Bermuda on November 10\\\\. These dates fall within the period with the most tropical cyclone activity in the Atlantic. In post-season analysis, two tropical cyclones that existed in October were added to HURDAT - the official Atlantic hurricane database. At one point during the season, September 3 through the following day, a set of three tropical cyclones existed simultaneously. The most significant storm of the season was Hurricane Three, nicknamed the San Ciriaco hurricane. A post-season analysis of this storm indicated that it was the longest-lasting Atlantic tropical cyclone on record. The path impacted the Lesser Antilles, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, the Bahamas, Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, and the Azores. The San Ciriaco hurricane alone caused about $20 million (1899 USD) in damage and at least 3,855 deaths. Another notable tropical cyclone, the Carrabelle hurricane, brought extensive damage to Dominican Republic and Florida Panhandle. Losses in Florida reached about $1 million. At least 9 deaths were associated with the storm. Hurricane Nine in October brought flooding to Cuba and Jamaica, as well as minor damage to South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia. __TOC__ Timeline ImageSize = width:800 height:200 PlotArea = top:10 bottom:80 right:20 left:20 Legend = columns:3 left:30 top:58 columnwidth:270 AlignBars = early DateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy Period = from:01/06/1899 till:01/12/1899 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal ScaleMinor = grid:black unit:month increment:1 start:01/06/1899 Colors = id:canvas value:gray(0.88) id:GP value:red id:TD value:rgb(0.38,0.73,1) legend:Tropical_Depression_=_‚â§39_mph_(‚â§62_km/h) id:TS value:rgb(0,0.98,0.96) legend:Tropical_Storm_=_39‚Äì73_mph_(63‚Äì117_km/h) id:C1 value:rgb(1,1,0.80) legend:Category_1_=_74‚Äì95_mph_(118‚Äì153_km/h) id:C2 value:rgb(1,0.91,0.46) legend:Category_2_=_96‚Äì110_mph_(154‚Äì177_km/h) id:C3 value:rgb(1,0.76,0.25) legend:Category_3_=_111‚Äì129_mph_(178‚Äì208_km/h) id:C4 value:rgb(1,0.56,0.13) legend:Category_4_=_130‚Äì156_mph_(209‚Äì251_km/h) id:C5 value:rgb(1,0.38,0.38) legend:Category_5_=_‚â•157_mph_(‚â•252_km/h) Backgroundcolors = canvas:canvas BarData = barset:Hurricane bar:Month PlotData= barset:Hurricane width:11 align:left fontsize:S shift:(4,-4) anchor:till from:26/06/1899 till:27/06/1899 color:TS text:\\"One (TS)\\" from:28/07/1899 till:02/08/1899 color:C2 text:\\"Two (C2)\\" from:03/08/1899 till:04/09/1899 color:C4 text:\\"Three (C4)\\" from:29/08/1899 till:08/09/1899 color:C2 text:\\"Four (C2)\\" from:03/09/1899 till:15/09/1899 color:C3 text:\\"Five (C3)\\" from:02/10/1899 till:08/10/1899 color:TS text:\\"Six (TS)\\" from:10/10/1899 till:14/10/1899 color:TS text:\\"Seven (TS)\\" barset:break from:15/10/1899 till:18/10/1899 color:TS text:\\"Eight (TS)\\" from:26/10/1899 till:31/10/1899 color:C2 text:\\"Nine (C2)\\" from:07/11/1899 till:10/11/1899 color:TS text:\\"Ten (TS)\\" bar:Month width:5 align:center fontsize:S shift:(0,-20) anchor:middle color:canvas from:01/06/1899 till:01/07/1899 text:June from:01/07/1899 till:01/08/1899 text:July from:01/08/1899 till:01/09/1899 text:August from:01/09/1899 till:01/10/1899 text:September from:01/10/1899 till:01/11/1899 text:October from:01/11/1899 till:01/12/1899 text:November TextData = pos:(570,30) text:\\"(From the\\" pos:(617,30) text:\\"Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale)\\" Systems =Tropical Storm One= Weather maps first indicated a tropical storm in the extreme northwestern Gulf of Mexico on June 26. With initial sustained winds of 40 mph (65 km/h), the storm did not differ in intensity as it headed northwestward. At 0900 UTC on June 27, the system made landfall near the southwestern end of Galveston Island, Texas at the same intensity. Three hours later, it weakened to a tropical depression and later dissipated over Southeast Texas at 1800 UTC. Heavy rainfall produced by the storm from Granbury to Waco and toward the coast contributed to an ongoing flood event in the state. According to Texas State Senator Asbury Bascom Davidson, the Brazos, Colorado, Guadalupe, Navasota, and San Saba Rivers overflowed. An estimated of land were inundated. In Hearne, water rose above every rain gauge. Thousands of people were left homeless. The flood caused $9 million in damage and 284 deaths. =Hurricane Two= The 1899 Carrabelle Hurricane A hurricane was first observed south of Dominican Republic on July 28\\\\. Shortly thereafter, it made landfall in Azua Province with an intensity equivalent to a Category 1 hurricane. Early on July 29, the system weakened to a tropical storm, shortly before emerging into the southwestern Atlantic Ocean. It then moved west-northwestward and remained at relatively the same intensity over the next 24 hours. The storm made landfall near Islamorada, Florida on July 30\\\\. Crossing the Florida Keys, it soon emerged into the Gulf of Mexico. The storm began to re-intensify on July 31 and became a hurricane later that day. Early on August 1, it peaked with winds of 100 mph (155 km/h), several hours before making landfall near Apalachicola, Florida at the same intensity. The storm quickly weakened inland and dissipated over southern Alabama on August 2\\\\. In Dominican Republic, three large schooners were wrecked at Santo Domingo; only one crew member on the three vessels survived. \\"Great\\" damage was reported along coastal sections of the country, while a loss of telegraph service impacted most of interior areas. In Florida, damage in the city of Carrabelle was extensive, with no more than a score of \\"unimportant\\" houses remained. Losses in the city reached approximately $100,000. At least 57 shipping vessels were destroyed; damage from these ships collectively totaled about $375,000. Additionally, 13 lumber vessels were beached. Many boats at the harbor and the wharfs in Lanark were wrecked. Large portions of stores and pavilions in the city were damaged. The towns of Curtis Mill and McIntyre were completely destroyed, while the resort city of St. Teresa suffered significant damage. Seven deaths were confirmed in Florida. Overall, losses reached at least $1 million. =Hurricane Three= Hurricane San Ciriaco of 1899 or The Great Bahamas Hurricane of 1899 The next storm was first observed as a tropical storm to the southwest of Cape Verde on August 3\\\\. It slowly strengthened while heading steadily west-northwestward across the Atlantic Ocean. By late on August 5, the storm strengthened into a hurricane. During the following 48 hours, it deepened further, reaching Category 4 hurricane status before crossing the Leeward Islands on August 7\\\\. Later that day, the storm attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 150 mph (240 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of . The storm weakened slightly before making landfall on Guayama, Puerto Rico with sustained winds of 140-145 mph (220 km/h) on August 8 producing storm surges of 15 feet along the coast of the island. The tropical storm killed 3,369 people, the most in Puerto Rico history, and produced rainfall for 24 hours. Several hours later, it emerged into the southwestern Atlantic as a Category 3 hurricane; it would remain at that intensity for over 9 days. The system paralleled the north coast of Dominican Republic and then crossed the Bahamas, striking several islands, including Andros and Grand Bahama. After clearing the Bahamas, it began heading northward on August 14, while centered east of Florida. Early on the following day, the storm re-curved northeastward and appeared to be heading out to sea. However, by August 17, it turned back to the northwest. At 0100 UTC on August 18, the storm made landfall near Hatteras, North Carolina with 120 mph winds. The storm weakened after moving inland and fell to Category 1 intensity by 1200 UTC on August 18\\\\. Later that day, the storm re-emerged into the Atlantic Ocean. Now heading northeastward, it continued weakening, but maintained Category 1 intensity. By late on August 20, the storm curved eastward over the northwestern Atlantic. It also began losing tropical characteristics and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone at 0000 UTC on August 22, while located about 325 miles (525 km) south of Sable Island. However, after four days, the system regenerated into a tropical storm while located about 695 miles (1,120 km) west-southwest of Flores Island in the Azores on August 26\\\\. It moved slowly north-northwestward, until curving to the east on August 29\\\\. Between August 26 and September 1, the storm did not differentiate in intensity, but began re-strengthening while turning southeastward on September 2\\\\. Early on the following day, the storm again reached hurricane intensity. It curved northeastward and passed through the Azores on September 3, shortly before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone. The storm had the longest duration of an Atlantic hurricane on record, lasting for 31 days, 28 of which it was tropical. In Guadeloupe, the storm unroofed and flooded many houses. Communications were significantly disrupted in the interior portions of the island. Impact was severe in Montserrat, with nearly every building destroyed and 100 deaths reported. About 200 small houses were destroyed on Saint Kitts, with estates suffering considerable damage, while nearly all estates were destroyed on Saint Croix. Eleven deaths were reported on the island. In Puerto Rico, the system brought strong winds and heavy rainfall, which caused extensive flooding. Approximately 250,000 people were left without food and shelter. Additionally, telephone, telegraph, and electrical services were completely lost. Overall, damage totaled approximately $20 million, with over half were losses inflicted on crops, particularly coffee. At the time, it was the costliest and worst tropical cyclone in Puerto Rico. It was officially estimated that the storm caused 3,369 fatalities in Puerto Rico. In the Bahamas, strong winds and waves sank 50 small crafts, most of them at Andros. Severe damage was reported in the capital city of Nassau, with over 100 buildings destroyed and many damaged, including the Government House. A few houses were also destroyed in Bimini. The death toll in the Bahamas was at least 125. In North Carolina, storm surge and rough sea destroyed fishing piers and bridges, as well as sink about 10 vessels. Because Hatteras Island was almost entirely inundated with of water, a great proportion of homes on the island were damaged, with much destruction at Diamond City. There were at least 20 deaths in the state of North Carolina. In the Azores, the storm also caused one fatality and significant damage on some islands. =Hurricane Four= Weather maps indicated a tropical storm just east of the Lesser Antilles beginning on August 29. The storm moved westward and strengthened into a hurricane early on August 30\\\\. Several hours later, it entered the Caribbean Sea after passing near Antigua and Montserrat. Impact was generally light in the Lesser Antilles. At San Juan, Puerto Rico, sustained winds reached . The storm maintained winds of 80 mph (130 km/h) as it continued westward across the Caribbean Sea. Vessels sailing from ports in Cuba and Hispaniola were advised to \\"take every precaution\\". After the storm curved northward late on September 1, vessels from Hispaniola only were advised to take caution. Late on September 1, the hurricane made landfall east of Jacmel, Haiti with winds of 80 mph (130 km/h). By 1800 UTC, it weakened to a tropical storm. The storm emerged into the Atlantic Ocean early on September 2, after weakening further. While passing just east of the Turks and Caicos Islands early on September 3, the storm re-strengthened and attained hurricane status again. Several hours later, it strengthened into a Category 2 hurricane and peaked with winds of 105 mph (165 km/h). After weakening to a Category 1 hurricane late on September 4, the storm passed northwest of Bermuda. Hurricane-force winds caused considerable damage on the island. At 1200 UTC on September 5, the hurricane became extratropical. =Hurricane Five= HURDAT initially indicates a tropical storm about west-southwest of Brava, Cape Verde on September 3\\\\. The storm moved west-northwestward and slowly intensified, reaching hurricane status late on September 5\\\\. It continued to slowly strengthen, becoming a Category 2 hurricane on September 6\\\\. About 24 hours later, the cyclone deepened into a Category 3 hurricane while located near the Lesser Antilles. On Saint Kitts, sustained winds reached , while up to of rainfall was reported. Many houses were destroyed on Anguilla and Barbuda. In the former, an estimated 200 homes were demolished, leaving 800 people homeless. Early on September 9, the storm reached maximum sustained winds of 120 mph (195 km/h). The storm maintained intensity as a Category 3 hurricane and re-curved northward by September 11\\\\. The hurricane turned northeastward on September 12 and began to accelerate. Early on September 13, it passed very close to Bermuda, with a minimum barometric pressure of observed on the island. Cedar trees were uprooted, while fruit and ornamental trees were swept out to sea. Some houses were destroyed, while others were deroofed. Severe damage was also reported at the naval yard and colonial government buildings. At Her Majesty's Dockyard alone, damage was \\"at least five figures\\". Early on September 14, the storm weakened to a Category 2 hurricane, then to a Category 1 several hours later. Shortly after 0000 UTC on September 15, the hurricane struck the Avalon Peninsula of Newfoundland with winds of 85 mph (140 km/h). It soon became extratropical. In Newfoundland, severe damage was reported at fishing premises. The schooners Angler, Daisy, and Lily May either capsized or were driven ashore, resulting in 16 deaths. =Tropical Storm Six= A ship in the western Caribbean Sea reported a tropical storm on October 2. The storm moved north-northwestward and entered the Gulf of Mexico early on the following day. Late on October 3, it peaked with maximum sustained winds of 60 mph (95 km/h). The storm re-curved eastward while situated over the northeastern Gulf of Mexico. At 0000 UTC on October 5, this system made landfall in modern-day Largo, Florida at the same intensity. Thereafter, the storm headed northeastward, until becoming extratropical early on October 6, while located offshore Georgia. Impact from this system was generally minor. Prior to landfall in Florida, the storm produced winds up to 40 mph (65 km/h) in Port Eads, Louisiana. The highest wind speed in Florida was in Jupiter. There, the storm also dropped of rain. The Jupiter area also reported rough seas, with the highest tides in 7 years. The storm wrecked two schooners - the John R. Anidia at Fernandina Beach and the John H. Tingue at Cumberland Island, Georgia. After becoming extratropical, the remnants of the storm brought wind gusts up to to Cape Henry, Virginia and Block Island, Rhode Island. =Tropical Storm Seven= Reports from a ship on October 10 indicated a tropical storm with sustained winds of 45 mph (75 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of . Located well southwest of Cape Verde, the storm moved northwestward without differentiating in intensity. It was lasted noted on October 14, while situated at 21.5¬∞N, 43.5¬∞W. =Tropical Storm Eight= A tropical depression developed in the central Bahamas on October 15\\\\. The depression moved east-northeastward strengthened into a tropical storm by the following day. Later on October 16, the storm peaked with winds of 45 mph (75 km/h). It re-curved northwestward and slowly began to weaken. Early on October 18, the system fell to tropical depression intensity. Several hours later, the cyclone dissipated while located about 195 miles (315 km) east-southeast of Virginia Beach, Virginia. =Hurricane Nine= An area of disturbed weather developed into a tropical storm while located south-southwest of Jamaica on October 26. The system moved slowly north-northwestward and gradually strengthened, reaching hurricane status on October 28\\\\. By early on the following day, it made landfall on the southern coast of Sancti Sp√≠ritus Province, Cuba. Briefly weakening to a tropical storm, the system re- intensified into a hurricane after reaching the Atlantic Ocean late on October 29\\\\. Moving toward the Bahamas, the storm became a Category 2 hurricane on October 30\\\\. Around that time, it struck Grand Bahama island. After peaking with winds of 110 mph (175 km/h), the system accelerated north-northwestward and made landfall near Myrtle Beach, South Carolina on October 31\\\\. It quickly weakened and became extratropical over Virginia later that day. In the city of Black River, Jamaica, rough seas caused significant damage to the marine industry and washed out crops. There were \\"many dead\\" in Jamaica, though the actual number of fatalities is unknown. Damage from the storm in Cuba was reported in the Sancti Sp√≠ritus and Santa Clara Provinces. Due to the threat of the Zaza River overflowing, residents were forced to evacuate. Strong winds and flooding destroyed several houses and severely damaged a number of others. At Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina, tides were reported as above normal. Water came over the wharves in Wilmington and inundated some streets; there was also flooding in New Bern, Morehead City, and Beaufort. One steamer was wrecked on the coast and 10 smaller vessels were driven ashore. One fatality was reported and damage was estimated at roughly $200,000. =Tropical Storm Ten= A ship observed a tropical storm north of Panama on November 7\\\\. The storm strengthened and headed northeastward across the central Caribbean Sea. It curved northward on November 8, around the time of peaking with winds of 65 mph (100 km/h). Later that day, the storm made landfall in Saint Thomas Parish, Jamaica at the same intensity. Thereafter, the system weakened and struck extreme western Santiago de Cuba Province, Cuba with winds of 50 mph (85 km/h) on November 9\\\\. It continued to weaken while crossing the island and emerged into the southwestern Atlantic Ocean later that day. The storm curved northeastward and passed through the Bahamas on November 10\\\\. It then weakened to a tropical depression, several hours before dissipating about southeast of Bermuda. The storm brought strong winds and heavy rainfall to Jamaica and Cuba. Significant damage was reported at Port Antonio, Jamaica, especially the property and agriculture of the United Fruit Company. Several districts of Saint Thomas Parish became isolated and the town of Morant Bay was \\"shattered\\". In Cuba, rainfall peaked at in the city of Santiago de Cuba. Damage to buildings and crops were reported in the region. Four fatalities occurred when a tree fell on their farmhouse in Manzanillo, Granma Province.

Inokashira Pond is a long, narrow pond, stretching from northwest to southeast, and split into two branches at the northwest end. From the southeast end, the Kanda River flows outward. A section of the stream is also within the bounds of the park. On the west side of the park is a thicket, in Gotenyama, and a small zoo. On the other side of Kichijoji Ave. is the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Bureau of Construction. On the southern side of the thicket, the Tamagawa Aqueduct flows toward the southeast, and further south is the ‚Äúwestern park‚Äù area. Beside the downstream section of the Tamagawa Aqueduct is there is an ‚ÄúEastern Garden,‚Äù which includes a small open area. With regard to city boundaries, the Inokashira Pond section of the Kanda River in the park, Inokashira-k≈çen Station, and the West and East gardens are in Mitaka. The area of the park beginning just past the northern shore of Inokashira Pond is in Musashino. Near the park, less than 500 meters from Inokashira Pond is Kichij≈çji station, on the JR Chuo Line. Kichij≈çji Station has a on its south side, facing toward the park. The path from the station toward the pond is lined with shops aimed at young people. In the southeast of the park is Inokashira-k≈çen Station, on the Keio Inokashira Line, which runs parallel to the Kanda River. The distance from the station to the pond is very short, and there are small paths and open spaces between them which visitors can wander through. It is said that, if you ride the boats on Inokashira Park's pond with a girlfriend, you will surely break up soon. Nature and the seasons Cherry Blossom illumination in Inokashira Park Spring in Inokashira Park is the season of the blooming cherry trees that line the pond. Looking from the Nanai Bridge, which crosses the pond near the center, the branches of the cherry trees extending from the shore bloom so densely as to all but cover the surface of the pond. The pale color of the blossoms contrasts with the sky and water's surface. During the blooming period of cherry blossoms the park receives many visitors. In addition, on the west side of the park there are many flowers to be seen in the flowering plum grove before the blooming period of the cherry trees. On the north side of the plum grove, on the edge of the pond, there is a spring, but its flow is nowadays weak. In summer one can enjoy the green of the trees that cover Gotenyama. In autumn the leaves of the many kinds of trees in the park change color, and the fallen leaves bury the walking paths. Winter in Inokashira Park is also lively. Many migrating birds come, and Inokashira Pond becomes their wintering place. Wild snakes can also be seen within the park. Attractions Inokashira Benzaiten The park contains a small temple dedicated to Benzaiten. The park has a petting zoo and a small aquarium, and is a place where vendors, musicians, artists and street performers gather. The park is bustling with crowds who arrive to take in the lively environment on weekends and holidays, especially during the cherry blossom season when the entire park is overrun with visitors for hanami. On the southwest end of Inokashira Park is the Ghibli Museum, a popular destination dedicated to the animated productions of Studio Ghibli.

The names for both the Apollo and Skylab space suits were Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU). The Apollo EMUs consisted of a Pressure Suit Assembly (PSA) aka \\"suit\\" and a Portable Life Support System (PLSS) that was more commonly called the \\"backpack\\". The A7L was the PSA model used on the Apollo 7 through 14 missions. The subsequent Apollo 15-17 lunar missions, Skylab, and Apollo-Soyuz used A7LB pressure suits. Additionally, these pressure suits varied by program usage. For the Skylab EMU, NASA elected to use an umbilical life support system named the Astronaut Life Support Assembly.  Basic design  The base Apollo EMU design took over three years to produce. At the beginning of the Apollo program, the Apollo spacesuit had not yet received its final EMU name. Between 1962 and 1964, the spacesuit was called the Space Suit Assembly (SSA). The Apollo SSA consisted of a Pressure Garment Assembly (PGA) and a backpack Portable Life Support System (PLSS). NASA held a competition for the Apollo SSA contract in March 1962. Each competition proposal had to demonstrate all the abilities needed to develop and produce the entire SSA. Many contractor-teams submitted proposals. Two gained NASA interest. The Hamilton Standard Division of United Aircraft Corporation proposal offered Hamilton providing the SSA program management and PLSS with David Clark Company as the PGA provider. The International Latex Corporation (ILC) proposal planned International Latex as the SSA program manager and PGA manufacturer, Republic Aviation providing additional suit experience and Westinghouse providing the PLSS. After evaluation of the proposals, NASA preferred the Hamilton PLSS concept and program experience but the ILC PGA design. NASA elected to split the Hamilton and ILC teams, issuing the contract to Hamilton with the stipulation that ILC provide the PGA. By March 1964, Hamilton and NASA had found three successive ILC Apollo PGA designs to not meet requirements. In comparative testing, only the David Clark Gemini suit was acceptable for Apollo Command Module use. While the Hamilton PLSS met all requirements, crewed testing proved the life support requirements were inadequate, forcing the Apollo SSA program to start over. In October 1964, NASA elected to split the spacesuit program into three parts. David Clark would provide the suits for the \\"Block I\\" early missions without extra- vehicular activity (EVA). The Hamilton/ILC program would continue as \\"Block II\\" to support the early EVA missions. The pressure suit design for Block II was to be selected in a June 1965 re-competition. To assure Block II backpack success, AiResearch was funded for a parallel backpack effort. The later, longer-duration Apollo missions would be Block III and have more advanced pressure suits and a longer duration backpack to be provided by suppliers selected in future competitions. To reflect this new start in the program, the PGA was renamed the Pressure Suit Assembly (PSA) across the programs and the Block II and III SSAs were renamed Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU). Hamilton and International Latex were never able to form an effective working relationship. In March 1965, Hamilton switched to B. F. Goodrich as suit supplier. International Latex, in July 1965, won the Block II suit competition with its A5L design. This forced NASA to assume management of the Block II EMU program directly. Before the end of 1965, Hamilton Standard completed certification of its new backpack. NASA subsequently terminated the Block II AiResearch backpack, thus completing the selection of the suit/backpack designs and suppliers to support man's first walking on the Moon. However, this was not to be without improvements. The Apollo 11 EMU featured an A7L suit with a -6 (dash six) backpack reflecting seven suit and six backpack design iterations. The A7L was a rear entry suit made in two versions. The Extra-vehicular (EV), which would be used on the Moon and the Command Module Pilot (CMP) that was a simpler garment. The A7L pressure suits reached space flight in October 1968 aboard Apollo 7. These were used as launch and reentry emergency suits. Also in 1968, NASA recognized that with modifications, the Block II EMU could additionally support the later EVA missions that involved a Lunar Rover Vehicle (LRV). This resulted in the termination of Apollo Block III in favor of an Apollo 15 through 17 EMU using an A7LB suit and a \\"-7\\" long duration backpack. The complete Apollo EMU made its space debut with Apollo 9 launched into space on March 3, 1969. On the fourth day of the mission, Lunar Module Pilot Russell Schweickart and Commander James McDivitt went into the Lunar Module. The astronauts then depressurized both the Command and Lunar Modules. Schweickart emerged from the Lunar Module to test the backpack and conduct experiments. David Scott partially emerged from the Command Module's hatch supported by an umbilical system connected to the Command Module to observe. The EVA lasted only 46 minutes but allowed a verification of both EVA configurations of the EMU. This was the only Apollo spacewalk prior to the Apollo 11 lunar landing mission. Apollo 11 made the A7L the most iconic suit of the program. It proved to be the primary pressure suit worn by NASA astronauts for Project Apollo. Starting in 1969, the A7L suits were designed and produced by ILC Dover (a division of Playtex at the time). The A7L is an evolution of ILC's initial A5L, which won a 1965 pressure suit competition, and A6L, which introduced the integrated thermal and micrometeroid cover layer. After the deadly Apollo 1 fire, the suit was upgraded to be fire- resistant and designated A7L. On July 20, 1969, the Apollo 11 EMUs were prominent in television coverage of the first lunar landing. Also in 1969, International Latex elected to spin-off its pressure suit business to form ILC Dover. The basic design of the A7L suit was a one piece, five-layer \\"torso- limb\\" suit with convoluted joints made of synthetic and natural rubber at the shoulders, elbows, wrist, hips, ankle, and knee joints. A shoulder \\"cable/conduit\\" assembly allowed the suit's shoulder to move forward, backwards, up, or down with user movements. Quick disconnects at the neck and forearms allowed for the connection of the pressure gloves and the famous Apollo \\"fishbowl helmet\\" (adopted by NASA as it allowed an unrestricted view, as well as eliminating the need for a visor seal required in the Mercury and Gemini and Apollo Block I spacesuit helmets). A cover layer, which was designed to be fireproof after the deadly Apollo 1 fire, was attached to the pressure garment assembly and was removable for repairs and inspection. All A7L suits featured a vertical zipper from the helmet disconnect (neck ring), down the back, and around the crotch. =Specifications, Apollo 7 - 14 EMU = *Name: Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) *Manufacturer: ILC Dover (Pressure Suit Assembly) and Hamilton Standard (Portable Life Support System) *Missions: Apollo 7-14 *Function: Intra-vehicular activity (IVA), orbital Extra-vehicular activity (EVA), and terrestrial EVA *Operating Pressure: 3.7 psi (25.5 kPa) *IVA Suit Mass: 62 lb (28.1 kg) *EVA Suit Mass: 76 lb (34.5 kg) *Total EVA Suit Mass: 200 lb (91 kg) *Primary Life Support: 6 hours *Backup Life Support: 30 minutes =Extravehicular Pressure Suit Assembly= left left Torso Limb Suit Assembly Between Apollos 7 and 14, the two lunar module astronauts, the Commander (CDR) and Lunar Module pilot (LMP), had Torso Limb Suit Assemblies (TSLA) with six life support connections placed in two parallel columns on the chest. The 4 lower connectors passed oxygen, an electrical headset/biomed connector was on the upper right, and a bidirectional cooling water connector was on the upper left. Integrated Thermal Micrometeoroid Garment Covering the Torso Limb Suit Assembly was an Integrated Thermal Micrometeoroid Garment (ITMG). This garment protected the suit from abrasion and protected the astronaut from thermal solar radiation and micrometeoroids which could puncture the suit. The garment was made from thirteen layers of material which were (from inside to outside): rubber coated nylon, 5 layers of aluminized Mylar, 4 layers of nonwoven Dacron, 2 layers of aluminized Kapton film/Beta marquisette laminate, and Teflon coated Beta filament cloth. Additionally, the ITMG also used a patch of 'Chromel-R' woven nickel-chrome (the familiar silver-colored patch seen especially on the suits worn by the Apollo 11 crew) for abrasion protection from the Portable Life Support System (PLSS) backpack. Chromel-R was also used on the uppers of the lunar boots and on the EVA gloves. Finally, patches of Teflon were used for additional abrasion protection on the knees, waist and shoulders of the ITMG. Starting with Apollo 13, a red band of Beta cloth was added to the commander's ITMG on each arm and leg, as well as a red stripe on the newly added EVA central visor assembly. The stripes, initially known as \\"Public Affairs stripes\\" but quickly renamed \\"commander's stripes\\", made it easy to distinguish the two astronauts on the lunar surface and were added by Brian Duff, head of Public Affairs at the Manned Spacecraft Center, to resolve the problem for the media as well as NASA of identifying astronauts in photographs. Liquid Cooling Garment Lunar crews also wore a three- layer Liquid Cooling and Ventilation Garment (LCG) or \\"union suit\\" with plastic tubing which circulated water to cool the astronaut down, minimizing sweating and fogging of the suit helmet. Water was supplied to the LCG from the PLSS backpack, where the circulating water was cooled to a constant comfortable temperature by a sublimator. =Portable Life Support System= At the beginning of the Apollo spacesuit competition, no one knew how the life support would attach to the suit, how the controls needed to be arranged, or what amount of life support was needed. What was known was that in ten months, the Portable Life Support System, aka \\"backpack\\", needed to be completed to support complete suit-system testing before the end of the twelfth month. Before the spacesuit contract was awarded, the requirement for normal life support per hour almost doubled. At this point, a maximum hourly metabolic energy expenditure requirement was added, which was over three times the original requirement. In late 1962, testing of an early training suit raised concerns about life support requirements. The concerns were dismissed because the forthcoming Apollo new-designs were expected to have lower effort mobility and improved ventilation systems. However, Hamilton took this as a strong indication that Apollo spacesuit life support requirements might significantly increase and initiated internally funded research and development in \\"backpack\\" technologies. In the tenth month, the first backpack was completed. Manned testing found the backpack to meet requirements. This would have been a great success but for the crewed testing confirming that the 1963 life support requirements were not sufficient to meet lunar mission needs. Early in 1964, the final Apollo spacesuit specifications were established that increased normal operations by 29% and increased maximum use support 25%. Again, the volume and weight constraints did not change. These final increases required operational efficiencies that spawned the invention of the porous plate sublimator and the Apollo liquid cooling garment. The porous plate sublimator had a metal plate with microscopic pores sized just right so that if the water flowing under the plate warmed to more than a user-comfortable level, frozen water in the plate would thaw, flow through the plate, and boil to the vacuum of space, taking away heat in the process. Once the water under the plate cooled to a user-comfortable temperature, the water in the plate would re- freeze, sealing the plate and stopping the cooling process. Thus, heat rejection with automatic temperature control was accomplished with no sensors or moving parts to malfunction. The Apollo liquid cooling garment was an open mesh garment with attached tubes to allow cooling water to circulate around the body to remove excess body heat when needed. The garment held the tubes against the body for highly efficient heat removal. The open mesh allowed air circulation over the body to remove humidity and additionally remove body heat. In 1966, NASA bought the rights to the liquid cooling garment to allow all organizations access to this technology. Before the first Apollo spacewalk, the backpack gained a front-mounted display and control unit named the remote control unit. This was revised for Apollo 11 to additionally provide camera attachment to provide high quality lunar pictures. =Intravehicular (CMP) Pressure Suit Assembly= left Torso Limb Suit Assembly The Command Module pilot (CMP) had a TSLA similar to the commander and lunar module pilot, but with unnecessary hardware deleted since the CMP would not be performing any extravehicular activities. For example, the CMP's TSLA had only one set of gas connectors instead of two, and had no water cooling connector. Also deleted was the pressure relief valve in the sleeve of the suit and the tether mounting attachments which were used in the lunar module. The TSLA for the CMP also deleted an arm bearing that allowed the arm to rotate above the elbow. Intravehicular Cover Layer Over the TSLA, command module pilots wore only a three-layer Intravehicular Cover Layer (IVCL) of nomex and beta cloth for fire and abrasion protection. Constant Wear Garment The CMP wore a simpler cotton fabric union suit called the Constant Wear Garment (CWG) underneath the TSLA instead of the water cooled Liquid Cooling Garment. His cooling came directly from the flow of oxygen into his suit via an umbilical from the spacecraft environmental control system. When not performing lunar EVA's, the LMP and CDR also wore a CWG instead of the LCG.  Apollo 15-17, Skylab and ASTP Spacesuits  = Apollo 15-17 EMU = left For the last three Apollo lunar flights Apollos 15, 16, and 17, the spacesuits were extensively revised. The pressure suits were called A7LB, which came in two versions. The Extra-vehicular (EV) version was a new mid- entry suit that allowed greater mobility and easier operations with the lunar rover. The A7LB EV suits were designed for longer duration J-series missions, in which three EVAs would be conducted and the Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV) would be used for the first time. Originally developed by ILC-Dover as the \\"A9L,\\" but given the designation \\"A7LB\\" by NASA, the new suit incorporated two new joints at the neck and waist. The waist joint was added to allow the astronaut to sit on the LRV and the neck joint was to provide additional visibility while driving the LRV. Because of the waist joint, the six life- support connectors were rearranged from the parallel pattern to a set of two \\"triangles,\\" and the up-and-down back zipper was revised and relocated. The \\"zipper\\" is actually a misnomer in that the A7L entry was through two zippers sewn over each other. The inner zipper had rubber teeth and provided sealing. The outer (externally visible) zipper was a conventional metal toothed slider for mechanical restraint. The A7LB had two pairs of such zipper sets that intersected on the right side of the suit above the waist joint. Opening the suit required undoing a clasp that held the zipper sets together. In addition, the EVA backpacks were modified to carry more oxygen, lithium hydroxide (LiOH), more power, and cooling water for the longer EVAs. While NASA wished these revisions to be accomplished without a volume increase, that was not possible. NASA allowed a minor protrusion on one side for an auxiliary water tank resulting in the last configuration of backpack. To maximize the return of lunar samples, the main module of both the Apollo 11,12,14 and 15-17 backpacks were left on the Moon. To facilitate these longer EVAs, small energy bars were carried in special pouches beneath the interior of the suit helmet ring, and the astronauts wore collar-like drinking water bags beneath the outer suit. Because the Vietnam War had taken toll on the federal budget, NASA's budget was in decline. The Command Module Pilot did not get a new mid- entry suit. NASA elected to modify existing A7L EV units by simply removing the liquid cooling features to create a \\"new\\" A7LB CMP suit. Once the existing inventory was consumed, a few new A7LB CMP suits were made to support Apollo 17. Because the J-series CSMs incorporated the Scientific Instrument Module (SIM) Bay, which used special film cameras similar to those used on Air Force spy satellites, and required a \\"deep space\\" EVA for retrieval, the CMP for each of the three J-series missions wore a five-connector A7LB-based H-series A7L suits, with the liquid cooling connections eliminated as the CMP would be attached to a life-support umbilical (like that used on Gemini EVAs) and only an \\"oxygen purge system\\" (OPS) would be used for emergency backup in the case of the failure of the umbilical. The CMP wore the commander's red-striped EVA visor assembly, while the LMP, who performed a \\"stand-up EVA\\" (to prevent the umbilical from getting \\"fouled up\\" and to store the film into the CSM) in the spacecraft hatch and connected to his normal life-support connections, wore the plain white EVA visor assembly.

To minimize program costs, NASA elected to fund ILC Dover for modifications to the mid-entry Apollo A7LB EV PSA design to reduce costs and use an umbilical system named the Astronaut Life Support Assembly (ALSA) to allow extra-vehicular activities. AiResearch won the competition for the ALSA. The result was the Skylab EMU. During launch, the space station was damaged. The Skylab EMUs enabled emergency repair and outfitting tasks that permitted the program to conduct its long duration crewed missions and experiments. Skylab returned to all the crew members having the same configuration suits. With the exception of the Orbital Workshop (OWS) repairs carried out by Skylab 2 and Skylab 3, all of the Skylab EVAs were conducted in connection to the routine maintenance carried out on the Apollo Telescope Mount, which housed the station's solar telescopes. Because of the short duration of those EVAs, and as a need to protect the delicate instruments, the Apollo lunar EVA backpack was replaced with an umbilical assembly designed to incorporate both breathing air (Skylab's atmosphere was 74% oxygen and 26% nitrogen at 5 psi) and liquid water for cooling. The assembly was worn on the astronaut's waist and served as the interface between the umbilical and the suit. An emergency oxygen pack was strapped to the wearer's right thigh and was able to supply a 30-minute emergency supply of pure oxygen in the case of umbilical failure. Another unique feature of the Skylab EMU was its simplified EVA visor assembly that did not include an insulated thermal cover over the outer visor shell. There were three crewed Skylab flights.

It stars Jack Black, and is loosely based on the story of Fray Tormenta (\\"Friar Storm\\", a.k.a. Rev. Sergio Guti√©rrez Ben√≠tez), a real-life Mexican Catholic priest who had a 23-year career as a masked luchador and competed in order to support the orphanage he directed. The film was produced by Black, White, David Klawans and Julia Pistor. The film was released on June 16, 2006 by Paramount Pictures. It received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $99.3 million at the worldwide box office against its $35 million production budget. Plot Ignacio's parents were a Scandinavian Lutheran missionary and a Mexican deacon, who both died when Ignacio was a baby. Now a cook for the Oaxaca monastery orphanage where he was raised, Ignacio dreams of becoming a luchador, but wrestling is strictly forbidden by the monastery as it is a sin of vanity. Ignacio cares deeply for the orphans and loves them with all his heart, but his food is terrible because he cannot afford quality ingredients. He also struggles over his feelings for Sister Encarnaci√≥n, a nun who teaches at the orphanage. One night, while collecting a bag of donated tortilla chips for the orphans, Ignacio is mugged of the chips by a street thief named Steven. After a fight between the two, Ignacio decides to disregard the monastery's rules and become a luchador in order to make money. He convinces Steven to join him with the promise of remuneration if they win, and the two join a local competition as tag partners. Ignacio changes his name to \\"Nacho\\" to keep his identity secret, while Steven adopts the name \\"Esqueleto\\" (Skeleton). They are defeated in their first match, but are nevertheless paid, as every wrestler is entitled to a portion of the total revenue. They continue to wrestle every week, with Ignacio using his pay to buy and prepare better food for the orphans. Ignacio gets used to losing some fights, but after a while, he gradually grows annoyed with the consistent losses. Steven brings him to a water gypsy who tells Ignacio to climb to an eagle's nest, crack open the egg and swallow the yolk, claiming that he will gain the powers of an eagle. Ignacio completes the task, but still loses the next several bouts, frustrating him. He seeks advice from champion luchador Ramses, but Ramses is vain and in no mood to help aspiring wrestlers. Ignacio's secret is finally exposed to the entire monastery when his robe catches fire during church, exposing his wrestling costume. He admits that he is Nacho and tells them that he intends to fight at a battle royale between eight luchadores for the right to take on Ramses, and for a cash prize, which he will use to buy a bus for the orphans. But the wrestler Silencio whose signature move is throwing people wins the match after piledriving Ignacio; Nacho comes in second place. Banished from the monastery, Ignacio leaves to live in the nearby wilderness. The next morning, Steven comes to tell him that Silencio has been injured (by Steven) and cannot fight, meaning that Nacho‚Äîas the second-place finisher‚Äîreceives the right to fight Ramses. Ignacio and Steven agree to team up again. That night, Ignacio sends a message via Steven to Encarnaci√≥n, explaining his plan and confessing his love to her. Despite initial difficulty, Nacho does well in the match. When the crowd begins to support Ignacio, Ramses resorts to cheating. Nacho is nearly defeated‚Äîindeed, unmasked‚Äîby Ramses, when Encarnaci√≥n enters the arena with the orphans. Elated and inspired, Nacho rallies himself and defeats Ramses with an aerial diving technique. Ignacio becomes a professional wrestler and, true to his word, buys a bus for the orphans with his prize money. The film closes with Ignacio, Steven and Sister Encarnaci√≥n taking the children on a field trip to the city of Monte Alb√°n.

Beck, being a fan of Hess, accepted. However, Paramount Pictures did not think Beck's style fit the movie, so composer Danny Elfman was brought in to replace him. Elfman then wrote a full score and recorded it in May 2006. However, only about 2/3 of Elfman's score ended up in the movie. Due to how much of Elfman's music filled the film, Elfman's representatives asked that Elfman be the only person credited for the film's score. Hess caught wind of this and would not allow the studio to remove Beck from the credits. When finding that he would not have the only music credit, Elfman told Paramount to remove his name from the film. An agreement was eventually reached where both Beck and Elfman were credited for their respective parts of the score. Release and reception The release date was originally set for May 2006, but was changed by Paramount to avoid competition from Fox's X-Men: The Last Stand and one of Paramount's other films, Mission: Impossible III. It was then placed between the releases of Disney/Pixar's Cars (June 9) and Warner Bros. and Legendary Pictures' Superman Returns (June 28). It was released on DVD and Blu-ray on October 24, 2006. It was distributed in Switzerland, Spain, and the Netherlands by Universal Pictures. During its opening weekend, Nacho Libre grossed $28,309,599, opening at #2 behind Cars second weekend. The total domestic box office stands at $80,197,993 and a worldwide total of $99,255,460. The film received mixed reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approving rating of 40%, with an average rating of 5.1/10. The website's critical consensus states: \\"At times hilarious, but other times offensive, director Jared Hess is unable to recapture the collective charisma of his Napoleon Dynamite characters, and instead, relies on a one-joke concept that runs out of steam. Sure to entertain the adolescents, however\\". Metacritic gave film a score of 52 based on 36 reviews, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". According to Roger Ebert, \\"it takes some doing to make a Jack Black comedy that doesn't work, but Nacho Libre does it\\". Michael Medved gave the film two and a half stars (out of four) calling it \\"amusing, but resistable [sic]\\", but adding that \\"director Jared Hess [employs] the same off-beat humor that made his Napoleon Dynamite a cult hit\\". Manohla Dargis of The New York Times gave it a positive review and called it \\"Endearingly ridiculous.\\" Soundtrack The track listing for the official soundtrack to Nacho Libre.

Video game A video game adaptation of the film was published by Majesco Entertainment and was released for the Nintendo DS. It is a cartoon-style wrestling game based upon the film. Possible sequel In November 2006, Jack Black, when asked, expressed his interest in a sequel; \\"I sure hope so, I love working with Jared. I think it's a good bet that we'll collaborate on something again. Mike had an idea that it would be Nacho goes to Japan, we'll see though.\\" However, Jared Hess (who directed the original movie) revealed in October 2009 that Paramount had never approached him about doing a sequel to Nacho Libre, though he said he would \\"love to work with Black again\\".

He was born at Tr√©voux. After rapidly completing his classical studies at the lyc√©e at Chartres, he spent some time in the administrative service and in journalism. He then entered the √âcole Nationale des Chartes, where, under the influence of J. Quicherat, he developed a strong inclination to the study of the Middle Ages. The lectures at the √âcole pratique des hautes √©tudes, which he attended from its foundation in 1868, revealed his true bent; and henceforth he devoted himself almost entirely to scholarship. He began modestly by the study of the municipal charters of Saint-Omer. Having been appointed assistant lecturer and afterwards full lecturer at the √âcole des Hautes √âtudes, it was to the town of Saint-Omer that he devoted his first lectures and his first important work, Histoire de la ville de Saint-Omer et de ses institutions jusqu'au XIVe si√®cle (1877). He, however, soon realized that the charters of one town can only be understood by comparing them with those of other towns, and he was gradually led to continue the work which Augustin Thierry had broadly outlined in his studies on the Tiers Etat. A minute knowledge of printed books and a methodical examination of departmental and communal archives furnished him with material for a long course of successful lectures, which gave rise to some important works on municipal history and led to a great revival of interest in the origins and significance of the urban communities in France. Giry himself published Les √âtablissements de Rouen (1883-1885), a study, based on very minute researches, of the charter granted to the capital of Normandy by Henry II, King of England, and of the diffusion of similar charters throughout the French dominions of the Plantagenets; a collection of Documents sur les relations de la royaut√© avec les villes de France de 1180 √† 1314 (1885); and √âtude sur les origines de la commune de Saint-Quentin (1887). About this time personal considerations induced Giry to devote the greater part of his activity to the study of diplomatics, which had been much neglected at the √âcole des Chartes, but had made great strides in Germany. As assistant (1883) and successor (1885) to Louis de Mas Latrie, Giry restored the study of diplomatics, which had been founded in France by Dom Jean Mabillon, to its legitimate importance. In 1894 he published his Manuel de diplomatique, a monument of lucid and well arranged erudition, which contained the fruits of his long experience of archives, original documents and textual criticism; and his pupils, especially those at the √âcole des Hautes √âtudes, soon caught his enthusiasm. With their collaboration he undertook the preparation of an inventory and, subsequently, of a critical edition of the Carolingian diplomas. By arrangement with Engelbert M√ºhlbacher and the editors of the Monumenta Germaniae Historica, this part of the joint work was reserved for Giry. Arthur Giry's Bookplate. Simultaneously with this work he carried on the publication of the annals of the Carolingian epoch on the model of the German Jahrb√ºcher, reserving for himself the reign of Charles the Bald. Of this series his pupils produced in his lifetime Les Derniers Carolingiens (by Ferdinand Lot, 1891), Eudes, comte de Paris et roi de France (by √âdouard Favr√©, 1893), and Charles le Simple (by Auguste Eckel, 1899). The biographies of Louis IV and Hugh Capet and the history of the kingdom of Provence were not published until after his death, and his own unfinished history of Charles the Bald was left to be completed by his pupils. The preliminary work on the Carolingian diplomas involved such lengthy and costly researches that the Acad√©mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres took over the expenses after Giry's death. In the midst of these multifarious labours Giry found time for extensive archaeological researches, and made a special study of the medieval treatises dealing with the technical processes employed in the arts and industries. He prepared a new edition of the monk Theophilus' celebrated treatise, Diversarum artium schedula, and for several years devoted his Saturday mornings to laboratory research with the chemist Aim√© Girard at the Conservatoire des Arts et M√©tiers, the results of which were utilized by Marcellin Berthelot in the first volume (1894) of his Chimie au moyen √¢ge. Giry took an energetic part in the Collection de textes relatifs a l'histoire du moyen √¢ge, which was due in great measure to his initiative. He was appointed director of the section of French history in La Grande Encyclop√©die, and contributed more than a hundred articles, many of which, e.g. \\"Archives\\" and \\"Diplomatique\\", were original works. In collaboration with his pupil Andr√© R√©ville, he wrote the chapters on L'√©mancipation des villes, les communes et les bourgeoisies and Le Commerce et l'industrie au moyen √¢ge for the Histoire g√©n√©rale of Lavisse and Rambaud. Giry took a keen interest in politics, joining the republican party and writing numerous articles in the republican newspapers, mainly on historical subjects. He was intensely interested in the Dreyfus case, but his robust constitution was undermined by the anxieties and disappointments occasioned by the Zola trial and the Rennes court-martial, and he died in Paris in 1899.

The film depicts the degrading effects of unemployment on a group of men left jobless by the closure of the shipyards in Vigo, Galicia. Plot After the closure of their shipyard in Northern Spain, a few former workers ‚Äì Santa, Jos√©, Lino, Amador, Serguei and Reina ‚Äì keep in touch. They meet mainly at a bar owned by their former colleague Rico. Santa is the most superficially confident and the unofficial leader of the group who dreams of one day going to Australia. A court case hangs over him that concerns a shipyard street lamp he smashed during a protest against the closure, which he claims to not want to pay, not because of the financial cost but of what it stands for. Jos√© is bitter that his wife, Ana, is employed while he is not. The gap between them is widening and he is fearful that she will leave him for a co-worker. Despite arthritic legs, Ana endures night shifts at a fish factory and thinks her looks are now lost. Not everyone seems to agree, including her boss. Lino, an aging family man, doggedly pursues positions beyond his qualifications. The oldest member of the group, Amador, has degenerated into alcoholism after being abandoned by his wife; maintaining an increasingly transparent pretense that his wife will soon return from holiday. Reina has managed to find a job as a watchman at a football club, smuggling his friends into a game. Lino attends job interviews despite applicants being near his son's age. This group of friends is observed by Nata, the landlord's teenage daughter who franchises her babysitting job to Santa. While babysitting, Santa invites his friends around to have a few beers outside where Serguei claims his career as an astronaut was forestalled by economic measures in the Soviet Space program. One night at the bar, Amador drinks too much and has to be assisted home by Santa, the two of whom share a long and meaningful conversation on the way back. As a result of his drunken state and the newly deepened friendship, Amador, who has never allowed any of the group to go inside his 4th floor apartment, lets Santa in to help him upstairs. After putting Amador to bed, Santa goes to wash some glasses only to find that there is no running water, leading him to explore the apartment which he sees is rundown and in a state hardly better than if he were living on the street. Santa finally agrees to pay off the debt in court. After driving off with his lawyer, they drive past the newly repaired street lamp where Santa tells the lawyer to pull over. Santa leaves the car, walks over to the lamp and smashes it again before driving off. Later that night, Santa goes to Amador's house to collect him to go to the bar but gets no response at the door. The flickering light above him brings attention to a partially caved-in roof. Santa steps backwards slowly, realising that the damage to the roof is due to Amador having jumped from his window while drunk, killing himself. His friends give him a dignified funeral albeit with a stolen floral arrangement. Meanwhile, Ana is at home packing in preparation to leave Jos√©. She waits for him on the couch with her bag on the floor. Upon returning from the funeral, Jos√© sits on the couch and lays across Ana's lap, telling her about the funeral and trying to make amends for the fighting they've been doing. Ana pities him and begins to cry as well, placing a blanket over her bag and deciding to stay without Jos√© ever knowing she had intended to leave. That same day, Lino is waiting in line for another job interview and before being called for his turn, he looks ahead seeing a reflection of himself, ultimately deciding that he is wasting his time looking for employment in such places. At night, the friends meet up again in the bar with the ashes of Amador and after pouring 'one last drink' in his urn, they make a decision and set off to spread the ashes. The friends go down to the shipyard and eventually find the ferry that they always took together and where it is implied that they met. Two of the men climb on board while the other two stand guard. The two on- board break into the cabin and find a way to start the ferry. Once they get it started, the other two climb aboard and they set off for the middle of the passage. Upon getting there, they realise that each one of them thought another had brought the urn and that they had left it behind. They chortle. The group of friends stay out all night in the middle of the passage without any cares and by morning there is a large crowd around the ferry terminal watching the men from afar. The men chat casually while sitting in the morning sun as the credits begin to roll.

The ratio of milk to eggs is higher than in a traditional Portuguese custard tart or Chinese egg tart, resulting in a lighter texture and a stronger milk flavour. The dessert originated among settlers at the Dutch Cape Colony in the 17th century, and is believed to have developed from the Dutch mattentaart, a cheesecake-like dessert which was included in the cookbook Een Notabel Boexcken Van Cokeryen (A Notable Book of Cookery) published by Thomas van der Noot around 1514. Some recipes require that the custard be baked in the crust, while others call for the custard to be prepared in advance, and then placed in the crust before serving. Cinnamon is often sprinkled over its surface, and the milk used for the custard may also be infused with a cinnamon stick before preparation. A staple at church fetes and home industries, and commonplace in South African supermarkets, melktert may either be served chilled or at room temperature.

The posthumous daughter of King Edward of Portugal and Eleanor of Aragon, she was born in the Quinta do Monte Olivete Villa, Almada.  Queen of Castile  On 21 May 1455 in C√≥rdoba, she married as his second wife King Henry IV of Castile who had repudiated his first consort, Blanche II of Navarre, after thirteen years of marriage. It was rumoured that their marriage had never been consummated due to the king's impotence. Henry and Joan shared the same maternal grandparents; Ferdinand I of Aragon and Eleanor of Alburquerque (making them first cousins). They also shared the same paternal great-grandfather; John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster (making them second cousins). In February 1462, six years after Joan's marriage to Henry, she gave birth to a daughter, also named Joan, called La Beltraneja because of rumours that she was in fact the daughter of Don Beltr√°n de la Cueva, 1st Duke of Alburquerque, who was suspected of being Joan's lover. Henry banished Joan from the royal court and she went to live in Coca at the castle of Henry's supporter, Bishop Fonseca. She soon fell in love with Bishop Fonseca's nephew; they embarked on a sexual affair, which resulted in Joan bearing her lover two illegitimate sons (see below). Henry subsequently declared their marriage had never been legal and thus divorced her in 1468. At the death of her former husband in 1474, Joan championed her daughter's right to succeed to the throne, but she died shortly thereafter. This led to the outbreak of the War of the Castilian Succession (1475‚Äì1479).  Scandals and illegitimate children  Prior to her banishment, Joan had provoked much criticism in the Castilian court as she allegedly wore dresses that displayed too much d√©colletage, and her philandering with men was considered scandalous. She was considered haughty, unscrupulous, ambitious and ruthless, participating in intrigues and completely controlling her husband. Joan has been credited with many lovers, including the poet Juan Rodr√≠guez de la C√°mara.James Fitzmaurice-Kelly, Chapters on Spanish Literature (A. Constable and Company, ltd., 1908), 74.James Fitzmaurice-Kelly, A History of Spanish Literature (D. Appleton and Company, 1898), 97. Joan had two illegitimate children by Pedro de Castilla y Fonseca \\"el mozo\\", nephew of Bishop Fonseca, and a great grandson of King Pedro of Castille. Her two sons were Pedro de Castilla y Portugal and Andres Apostol de Castilla y Portugal. The birth of her two illegitimate children only added to Joan's considerable notoriety. She later entered the convent of San Francisco in Segovia. Joan died in Madrid on June 13, 1475 at the age of 36. She was buried in the Convent of San Francisco.

The museum is amongst Denmark's major contemporary and modern art ventures, encompassing significant international cultural works and exhibitions. Arken is located in the suburb-city Ish√∏j, close to K√∏ge (K√∏ge bugt), twenty kilometres south of Copenhagen, Denmark. Arken museum was designed by 25-year old architect student S√∏ren Robert Lund in a distinct architectural form and was authorised by Copenhagen County. It was inaugurated on the 15th March 1996 and was conceived by Queen Margrethe; her majesty of Denmark. Arken Museum of Modern Art's collection offers major works of over 400 Danish, Scandinavian and International post- war art, including renowned creations by Damien Hirst, Olafur Eliasson, Anselm Reyle Shirin Neshat, Wolfgang Tillmans, Danish / Norwegian duo Ingar Dragset and Michael Elmgreen and many more. Arken, due to its synthesis of contemporary art, maritime architecture and landscape, is also acknowledged as a milestone in Danish Architecture. The museum showcases an overview of contemporary and modern art, presenting cultural and research-based exhibitions, architecture and design, sculptural artefacts, paintings, prints, site installations and mixed-media displays. History, context and influences Arken (Danish for ‚Äòthe Ark‚Äô), created and publicised in 1996, as an idiosyncratic and distinct architectural form, featuring an amassed assemble of international works. The history of Arken Museum of Modern Art has been embarked back to the museum's foundation of formulating a unit of international proportions and an active dynamic space. The museum re-opened in January 2008 after major refurbishing, which included an expansion providing an additional 50% of gallery-space. = Before Arken: 1988-1992 = In the 20th century, there was a global growth of contemporary art museums, significantly the Museum of Modern Art was opened in 1988. Collectively, this influenced a rise and a prominent increase in cultural institutions to showcase both local and international art. It has played a major role in the development and collection of contemporary art. In 1988, an architectural competition for the creation of a new contemporary art museum in southwest of Copenhagen took place. This resulted in 25-year-old student architect, S√∏ren Robert Lund effectively winning first-prize of the competition and awarded the commission of its design which was finalised in 1992. The title ‚ÄúArken‚Äù was also chosen from the open architectural competition. The initial idea was for Arken to be located on the beach as a characteristic maritime architectural form to reflect its Danish title. Due to conservation reasons, the museum was built back behind low sand dunes and between a lagoon. = 1996-1999 = Prior to the museum's inauguration, there were several years of significant social, cultural and political changes within Denmark, in the late 20th Century. In the 1960s, the municipalities south of Copenhagen showcased a rapid growth in residents, particularly immigrants of Kurdish, Turkish and Pakistani nationalities. A trend that further strengthened the area's multicultural development was the migration of inner-city residents to the districts south of Copenhagen. This gave rise to an influx of multicultural regions in Denmark, in turn, fusing local and international art.228x228px = 21st Century = Arken, as a cultural institution in transition, undertook two major renovation and expansion designed by original architect S√∏ren Robert Lund alongside C.F. M√∏ller Architects. The museum encompassed permanent collections and donations of works from 2005-2008 by Damien Hirst, Marc Quinn, Mona Hatoum, Jeppe Hein, Jeff Koons and Elmgreen & Dragset ARKEN also published the Arken Bulletin which is a place of discussion amongst international academia on artistic theory and museology. Each year ARKEN awards the 'ARKENs kunstpris' prize of 100,000 Danish kroner to a contemporary artist. Architecture The museum is designed and built as a deconstructive, nautically- inspired architectural form. In a cultural institution, this style of architecture has come under public notice through Museum of Modern Art's 1988 Deconstructivist Architecture exhibition in New York, featuring notable works of Daniel Libeskind, Frank Gehry, and Zaha Hadid. Deconstructivist architecture has been invigorated publicly by Jacques Derrida, Peter Eisenman and Bernard Tschumi. This wave of deconstruction in architectural form became prominent in Europe in the 1980s, a style S√∏ren Robert Lundin used to design Arken. The museum reflects this movement and extension from the rational approach of modernism. Architectural deconstructivism requires an existence of an archetypal construction, a strong dialect of conventional presence to experiment flexibility against. Arken museum is conceived as a shipwreck architectural form, embodying spatial envelopes, altered geometric massing's and subversion, showcasing an effective act of deconstruction. Deconstructivist architecture, with its inclination towards deformation and dislocation, bears angular forms and abstract geometries, as defined in Arken's exterior and interior space. The museum displays deconstructivism by ‚Äúbreaking down the epitomised idea of a building, exposing its inside to its outside, reconstructing a variety of spaces, and forcing different access points.‚Äù Arken's formal plan incorporates assembled building parts, split and fragmented to create a fragmented ship form and a floor plan with slanted angles. Contrasting colours of grey to red walls, large open rooms to small rooms, and slanted building angles with curved galleries creates visible deconstruction. Arken models geometric imbalance and fragmentation to oppose modernism notions of ‚Äúform follows function‚Äù, ‚Äútruth to material‚Äù and ‚Äúpurity of form.‚Äù = Extensions = Since its inauguration in 1966, the museum has undergone architectural and spatial reformation, responding to contemporary agendas of social change. Arken's expansion and periodic transformation increased public accessibility space by 50% compared to its initial built space in 1996, making the space open to change and a ‚Äúcontemporary museological practice.‚Äù The expansion enabled Arken to shift its approach from presenting its archives of paintings, design and artworks on paper towards a display of integrated large sculptural masses such as the UTOPIA Project.  Extension 1: 2008-2009  Interior of ARKEN The Museum reopened its doors publicly on the 5th of September 2009, following a renovation constructed by Arken's original architect S√∏ren Robert Lund and design partner, CF M√∏ller Architect. The refurbishment consisted of 3 sections: a new sculpture gallery and main entrance by S√∏ren Robert Lund, and education and experience workshop areas designed by Anna Maria Indrio of CF M√∏ller Architects. This extension significantly expanded Arken's new exhibit room to 1600m2, with the total area being 5000m2. The museum eradicated load- bearing walls or columns in all individual rooms, with the new exhibition hall structured as four white quadrants. Air conditioning structures were recessed into walls and security equipment was placed in floor boxed beneath steel plates, as C.F. M√∏ller aimed to retain Arken's ‚Äúexisting facade‚Äôs rhythm and proportions.‚Äù The ceilings were lowered, and a new white box design was introduced. The annexes designers were Anna Maria Indrio as part of C.F.M√∏llers Tegnestue. Annie and Otto Johs. Detlefs‚Äô Foundation financially backed up the new 1100 m2 extension, both donating approximately $10 million. The Detlefs Hall designed for displaying sculptural works and additional extension of educational workshop rooms were incorporated and refurbished across the north side of the building. The redesigned entrance leads to a new 600m2 large room, functioning as the core of the museum, and being a central point for all rooms and amenities.  Extension 2: 2016  222x222px The donation and financial investment for Arken's second extension was given by A.P.M√∏ller and Hustru Chastine, McKinney M√∏ller Foundation for General Purposes, enabling a water landscape. The excavation of extensive areas surrounding the gallery aimed to recognise the museum's characteristic maritime architecture and the surrounding landscape as an ‚ÄúIsland of Art.‚Äù The museum was moved to an island instead of the original plan of a beach-side placement due to environmental conservation factors that relate to the ecological balance and heritage. This extension provides maritime landscape of three road bridges, two pedestrian bridges, lagoons, native plantations and an architectural sculptural park. The refurbishment and extension were managed by Schul Landskabsarkitekter in conjunction with M√∏ller and Gr√∏nborg, as a ‚Äútransition from nature to culture.‚Äù The two pedestrian bridges were formally reconstructed diagonally on the museum's main axis to create a transitional causeway from the maritime landscape to the gallery.  Collections  The Museum is a home to significant international cultural pieces and notable displays from a collective assemble of over 400 artists. The collection spans from World War IIin 1945 to the present day, incorporating permanent caches by Damien Hirst, Olafur Eliasson, Ai Wei Wei, Ingar Dragset and Michael Elmgreen and Asger Jorn. The Museum's collection incorporates two underpinning themes: (1) the human condition of modernistic man and (2) about art that questions the essential definition of art itself, via new media, mixed-materials and sculptural forms. Situated on the left of the entrance on Arken's forecourt is a sculpture of a child riding a rocking horse, labelled Powerless Structures by Ingar Dragset and Michael Elmgreen . The equestrian statue aims to honour the heroism of humanism. > The image of a young boy astride his rocking horse encourages viewers to > consider the less spectacular events in their lives, which are often the > most important. The sculpture invokes life‚Äôs everyday activities and > questions the tradition of monuments predicated on military victory or > defeat. Arken's archives hold a permanent display of British artist, Damien Hirst. Notable displays include: Love‚Äôs Paradox, 2007, Beautiful Strummerville Spin, 2010 and 2-Amino-5-Bromobenzotrifluoride, 2011 which measures 4.57 by 14.32 metres and is curated size-specific to fit in Arken. These donations were by Dennis and Jytte Merla Dresing of the Merla Foundation. The collection of Damien Hirst works were assembled in a \\"Hirst Room\\", a gallery space dedicated to showcase his works.

Franklin, a former United States Department of Defense employee, pleaded guilty to several espionage-related charges and was sentenced in January 2006 to nearly 13 years of prison, which was later reduced to ten months' house arrest. Franklin passed information to American Israel Public Affairs Committee policy director Steven Rosen and AIPAC senior Iran analyst Keith Weissman, who later were fired by AIPAC. They were later indicted for illegally conspiring to gather and disclose classified national security information to Israel. However, prosecutors later dropped all charges against them without any plea bargain. On June 11, prosecutors asked Judge Ellis to reduce Franklin's sentence to eight years for his cooperation. Judge Ellis said the dropping of the case against Rosen and Weissman was a \\"significant\\" factor in the sentencing of Franklin and sentenced him to ten months' house arrest along with 100 hours of community service. Ellis said Franklin's community service should consist of \\"speaking to young people about the importance of public officials obeying the law\\".Sentence Reduced In Pentagon Case The Washington Post, June 12, 2009 Background On August 27, 2004, CBS News broke a story about a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) investigation into a possible spy in the U.S. Department of Defense working for Israel. The story reported that the FBI had uncovered a spy working as a policy analyst under Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Douglas Feith and then-Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz. He was later identified as Lawrence Franklin, who had previously served as an attach√© at the U.S. embassy in Israel and was one of two mid-level Pentagon officials in the Office of the Secretary of Defense responsible for Iran policy in the office's Northern Gulf directorate.Suspected Pentagon spy served in Israel , Reuters, August 29, 2004, archived 2004-08-31.David Johnston and Eric Schmitt, F.B.I. Is Said to Brief Pentagon Bosses on Spy Case; Charges Are Possible, The New York Times, August 31, 2004 Franklin has pleaded guilty to passing on oral information about a classified presidential directive, and other sensitive information pertaining to U.S. deliberations on foreign policy regarding Iran to AIPAC, who in turn provided the information to Israel. FBI sources have indicated that the year-long investigation was actively underway when the CBS News story broke. Franklin never passed any documents to AIPAC, only oral information. According to FBI surveillance tapes, in 2003 Franklin relayed top-secret information orally to Rosen and Keith Weissman, a senior Iran analyst with AIPAC, while at the Tivoli Restaurant in Arlington, Virginia. On 27 August, the FBI raided Rosen's office, copying his personal computer's hard drive.The Jerusalem Post According to The New York Times, Lawrence Franklin was one of two U.S. officials who held meetings with Iranian dissidents, including Paris- based arms dealer Manucher Ghorbanifar, a key figure in the Iran‚ÄìContra affair. These Pentagon-approved meetings were brokered by neoconservative Michael Ledeen of the American Enterprise Institute, who had also played a part in Iran-Contra, and is said to have taken place in Paris in June 2003. The Jerusalem Post reported that the purpose of the meetings was to \\"undermine a pending deal that the White House had been negotiating with the Iranian government\\", specifically, an exchange of high-ranking al-Qaeda members in Iranian custody in return for a stop to U.S. support of the anti-Iranian Mujahideen al-Khalq fighters in Iraq.The Jerusalem Post The Jerusalem Post article dated the beginning of the FBI investigation to this secret meeting, which the public first learned about in August 2003. Franklin had previously been assigned to a unit tasked with the Pentagon's Iraq policy, raising concern that he might have been used to influence the war on Iraq, although Pentagon officials have maintained that he was in no position to influence policy. (See also Office of Special Plans.) On August 30, 2004, Israeli officials admitted that Franklin had met repeatedly with Naor Gilon, head of the political department at the Israeli Embassy in Washington and a specialist on Iran's nuclear programs, but point out that this was completely appropriate activity for the two Iran specialists. A Newsweek report indicates that Gilon was under FBI surveillance and that Franklin only became a target after these meetings.Newsweek It has been suggested that Franklin's motivations may have been ideological or personal, rather than financial. An unnamed U.S. intelligence official told Newsweek: \\"for whatever reason, the guy hates Iran [the Iranian government] passionately.\\" Franklin's security clearance was revoked, although he was not fired, merely demoted. The FBI investigation continued until May 5 when he was arrested and charged with giving away top- secret information. The indictment revealed that the investigation had been going on since 1999, and suggested that other individuals at AIPAC, the Defense Department and the Israeli embassy had been involved as well. The indictment also alleged that Kenneth Pollack, a National Security Council staffer during the Clinton administration (and director of research at the Brookings Institution's Saban Center for Middle East Policy) provided information to former AIPAC employees Steve J. Rosen and Keith Weissman. This allegation was not part of any of the legal proceeding in this case. Pollack, and a senior State Department official, David Satterfield, were termed \\"unindicted co-conspirators.\\"Bush officials subpoenaed in AIPAC trial, N Guttman, The Jerusalem Post, 13 March 2006, retrieved July 2007 Criminal charges On May 3, 2005, the FBI filed criminal charges against Franklin. The complaint alleges that, at a June 26, 2003 lunch, Franklin disclosed classified national defense information related to potential attacks on U.S. forces in Iraq to two unnamed individuals. According to contemporary media reports, the two individuals were Steve J. Rosen and Keith Weissman, who were employed by AIPAC at the time. The complaint also alleged that Franklin disclosed classified information to \\"a foreign official and members of the media\\", and that a search of Franklin's home found approximately 83 classified documents. Franklin appeared in court on May 4, 2005. He was released on $100,000 bond. Franklin's lawyer said he would plead not guilty. On August 4, a federal grand jury indicted Franklin on five charges of violating the Espionage Act of 1917 : *One count of conspiracy to communicate national defense information to people not entitled to receive it. (18 USC 793 (d), (e) and (g)) *Three counts of communicating national defense information to people not entitled to receive it. (18 USC 793) *One count of conspiring to communicate national defense information to an agent of a foreign government. (50 US 783, 18 USC 371) After being confronted by the FBI in the spring of 2004, Franklin agreed to cooperate and to pass on fabricated information to selected information. He contacted several individuals, including Weissman, with whom he had not seen in over a year. In July 2004, in the Patisserie of the Pentagon City mall's Nordstroms, Franklin repeated the fabricated information orally to Weissman. Because one item concerned imminent assassination plots against Kurds, Iraqis, and Israelis, Weissman felt obligated to pass that information on to the governments whose citizens he told Weissman were targeted.Edmund Black, Jerusalem Report, October 4, 2004, Jewish Telegraphic Agency (JTA), September 20, 2004, JTA, December 21, 2004, JTA, December 23, 2004 Rosen was further charged with one count each of the first two, and Weissman with one count of the first charge. Weissman and Rosen remain the only individuals uncharged under 18 USC 793 of the Espionage Act who had never received or passed on any documents, a fact that even their indictment shows. Franklin only provided them with oral information. In addition, Weissman is still the only person in history charged under this law who had never worked for the US government. (Rosen had done contract work for the Defense Department while working at the Rand Corporation in the late 1970s. According to The Washington Post, \\"A lawyer familiar with the AIPAC case said administration officials 'want[ed] this case as a precedent so they can have it in their arsenal' and added: 'This as a weapon that can be turned against the media.'\\"Pincus, Walter (2006-02-17) Senator May Seek Tougher Law on Leaks, The Washington Post Guilty plea On September 30, 2005, The Washington Post reported that Franklin was negotiating an agreement with prosecutors and would plead guilty to at least the conspiracy charges at a court hearing the following week, after which he would continue his cooperation with prosecutors.Jerry Markon, Guilty Plea Planned in Secrets Case, The Washington Post, September 30, 2005. He did indeed plead guilty to the three conspiracy counts on October 5, explaining that he had shared his frustrations over U.S. Iran policy with the other two defendants regularly in 2002 and later passed oral information to them he knew was classified in the hope they could get them to employees of the National Security Council who might be able to help force a harder line. He also asked Rosen for help getting him a job at the NSC; Rosen told him politely, \\"I'll see what I can do,\\" claimed Franklin. Rosen never acted upon this request because Franklin eventually was charged with conspiracy counts.Eric Lichtblau, Pentagon Analyst Admits Sharing Secret Data, The New York Times, October 6, 2005. He also passed other classified information along to an Israeli official concerning weapons testing and military activities in Iraq and other Middle Eastern countries. In return, he said, the Israeli official told him far more. Franklin stated that he knew some of the documents and oral information he passed along could be used to the detriment of U.S. national security interests. However, he never passed nor even showed any documents to Weissman or Rosen. On January 20, 2006, Judge T.S. Ellis, III sentenced Franklin to 12 years and 7 months in prison and a $10,000 fine for passing classified information to a pro-Israel lobby group and an Israeli diplomat but Franklin was to remain free pending his cooperation with prosecutors in the cases against Rosen and Weissman.David Johnston, Pentagon Analyst Gets 12 Years for Disclosing Data, The New York Times, January 20, 2006. In August, he denied Weissman and Rosen's motion to dismiss their indictment on the grounds that the government could still prosecute and punish those who retransmitted classified information orally regardless of whether they had a security clearance or not,Ellis memorandum opinion on defense motion to dismiss indictments, from the Federation of American Scientists an interpretation of the Espionage Act that could have wide-reaching implications if it were allowed to become legal precedent. A significant problem for the government arose in a pre-trial ruling in August 2006, when veteran trial judge T.S. Ellis III ruled that line to mean that prosecutors had to show that U.S. interests were harmed, not just that Rosen and Weissman relayed secrets to a foreign power: Israel. Relaying secrets to friends of the United States, Ellis ruled, was not in and of itself criminal. For a crime to be committed, he wrote in his opinion, the accused must have sought both benefit to another nation as well as to harm the United States. Ellis' legal rulings set a high bar for the prosecutors, including a requirement to prove that Rosen and Weissman knowingly meant to harm the United States or aid another country.http://www.jstandard.com/index.php/content/item/aipac_decision_a_victory_ --_with_qualifiers/8172 In May 2009, federal prosecutors dropped the charges against Rosen and Weissman, citing that restrictions the judge had placed on the case made a conviction unlikely. Lawyers familiar with the case noted that the prosecutors' case had many other problems as well, most notably that Weissman and Rosen had a very strong defense. On June 11, prosecutors asked Judge Ellis to reduce Franklin's sentence to eight years for his cooperation. Judge Ellis said the dropping of the case against Rosen and Weissman was a \\"significant\\" factor in the sentencing of Franklin and sentenced him to ten months house arrest along with 100 hours of community service. Ellis said Franklin's community service should consist of \\"speaking to young people about the importance of public officials obeying the law\\".http://www.sott.net/articles/show/186731-Strange-Law-Sentence- of-10-months-of-community-confinement-for-Spying- Franklin's account of events In late 2009, Franklin wrote that his objective was \\"to halt the rush to war in Iraq‚Äîat least long enough to adopt a realistic policy toward an Iran bent on doing us ill\\", not \\"to leak secrets to a foreign government\\".Larry Franklin, My Secret Plan to Overthrow the Mullahs, Foreign Policy, November/December 2009. However, the meetings with AIPAC officials in which the pertinent oral information was transmitted, which brought Franklin to the FBI's attention, occurred over three months after the 2003 invasion of Iraq Franklin confirmed that never passed any documents to Weissman and Rosen, only oral information. Accusations denied by AIPAC and Israel The spying charges have been denied by Israel as well as AIPAC. The Israeli Embassy in Washington called the charges \\"completely false and outrageous\\" and AIPAC stated the allegations were \\"baseless and false.\\" On December 1, 2004, FBI agents raided the offices of AIPAC and seized computer equipment and files of Howard Kohr, the Executive Director, Richard Fishman, Managing Director, Renee Rothstein, Communication Director and Raphael Danziger. Research Director. According to an article published in The Washington Post eight days later, all were suspected of being cut-outs, agents who picked up information from Franklin and passed it on to Israel. The FBI did not bring charges against any of them. There has been at least one case of Israeli espionage in the United States before the AIPAC scandal. Jonathan Pollard, an Israeli spy who worked in the Naval Antiterrorist Alert Center, pleaded guilty to espionage and was sentenced to life in prison in 1987. The incident had a significantly detrimental impact on U.S.‚ÄìIsraeli relations. Israeli officials have stated that the Israeli government terminated all espionage activities in the United States after the Pollard affair. Some believe that Israel's credibility with regard to Franklin is tainted by their insistence in the Pollard case that he likewise was not a spy, a position they maintained for 13 years before admitting, in 1998, that Pollard indeed had been a spy for Israel. Others think the damage that Israel sustained over the Pollard affair makes it unlikely that the country would again jeopardize its relationship with the United States through espionage, and note that the U.S. government has neither registered a protest with the Israelis nor accused its officials of wrongdoing in the AIPAC affair. Pentagon statement: Franklin did not influence policy According to a Pentagon statement, \\"the investigation involves a single individual at D.O.D. at the desk officer level, who was not in a position to have significant influence over U.S. policy.\\" However, this characterization ignores evidence that while at the Office of Special Plans, Douglas Feith used Larry Franklin for sensitive projects involving foreign citizen contacts, overseas. Context for the investigation =Concern about uncontrolled military technology transfers= Journalist Jim Lobe suggests that the Franklin story is part of a larger investigation into transfer of sensitive military and dual-use technologies to Israel, including powerful case- management software. A concern is that Israeli companies have then re-sold sensitive U.S.-derived technology to potential U.S. strategic rivals such as Russia and China, and possibly on the black market where it can potentially be obtained by terrorist groups such as al-Qaeda. =Media reaction= The Los Angeles Times felt \\"the government was right to drop its espionage case ... not because we think spying for Israel should be subjected to a different standard than spying for other countries, and not because the political ramifications of a conviction were potentially unpleasant. But this was the first prosecution under the Espionage Act of suspects who weren't government employees. ... The fact that Rosen and Weissman are private citizens makes an important distinction. When the judge ruled that the government can punish those outside of the government for the unauthorized receipt and deliberate retransmission of information relating to the national defense,' we couldn't help but take notice.\\" For our part, we're pleased that it's going away‚Äînot because we think spying for Israel should be subjected to a different standard than spying for other countries, and not because the political ramifications of a conviction were potentially unpleasant. But this was the first prosecution under the Espionage Act of suspects who weren't government employees. The sole government official involved in this story, Pentagon analyst Lawrence A. Franklin (who initially passed the secrets to the two lobbyists), has already been convicted. Wouldn't that cover news reporting of leaked information? We can understand laws to keep government officials from leaking sensitive secrets, but once that information is out, do we really want to start prosecuting journalists and others who publish it? That sounds more like Britain's Official Secrets Act than an American law consonant with the 1st Amendment. When Congress passed the Espionage Act, it explicitly rejected a version that would have punished newspapers for printing information \\"useful to the enemy.\\" That was the right decision then, and there's no rationale for undoing it now. =Rosen interview= In a television interview broadcast in Israel, Rosen said, \\"What it would have shown is that I did nothing wrong,\\" he said. \\"Who did something wrong is the people who brought this case, not just that they were incorrect, but that the attitude they had about Jews, Israel, AIPAC, was completely false, and unfortunately, a lot of that nonsense is still out there. \\"They knew very well that I spoke to the Embassy of Israel, it was no great surprise to them, they also spoke to the embassy,\\" he said. \\"We would have a triangle, three-way conversation. It was nothing special. It was normal. But these people were talking as if we were a nest of spies, that we were doing something against America.\\" In the interview at his home, Rosen charged that Lawrence Franklin was railroaded into pleading guilty, by threats to harm his family by cutting off his pension. He said federal prosecutors used the same type of tactics against him. \\"They wanted to destroy me. They forced AIPAC to fire me. They forced AIPAC to cut off my attorneys' fees,\\" he said. \\"They tried to isolate me, to put me in a situation of desperation where I would have to plead guilty to something I did not do. This happens all the time.\\" Rosen and Weissman may sue the government to recover legal costs, which are estimated at more than $10 million.

Scotton played his first match at Lord's for Sixteen Colts of England against the Marylebone Cricket Club on 11 and 12 May 1874, scoring on that occasion 19 and 0. He was engaged as a groundman by the MCC in that year and in 1875, and after an engagement at Kennington Oval returned to the service of the MCC, of whose ground staff he was a member at the time of his death. His powers were rather slow to ripen, and he had been playing for several years before he obtained anything like a first-rate position. At one period of his career, however, and more particularly during the seasons of 1884 and 1886, he was among the best professional left-handed batsman in England. The 1884 and 1885 seasons In 1884 he scored 567 runs for Nottinghamshire in thirteen matches, with an average of 31.9; in 1885, 442 runs in fourteen engagements, with an average of 22.2; and in 1886, in county fixtures only, 559 runs, with an average of 29.8. This included a knock of 90 for England against Australia at Kennington Oval in August 1884. The match, resulted in a draw, Australia scoring 551 and England 346 and 85 for two wickets. In England's first innings Scotton went in first, and was the ninth man out, the total when he left being 332. During a stay of five hours and three quarters he played the bowling of Fred Spofforth, Palmer, Boyle, Billy Midwinter, and George Giffen without giving a chance, Had he fallen it would have been quite likely that England would have been beaten. Up to a certain time he received very little assistance, but when Walter Read joined him, 151 runs were put on for the ninth wicket. The 1886 Oval Test Against the Australian team of 1886 Scotton played two successful innings in company with WG Grace, the two batsmen scoring 170 together for the first wicket for England at the Oval. Scotton's score at the Oval was only 34 in 225. When Scotton was out, Walter Read came in and made 94 in 210 minutes. Scotton's slow scoring, particularly when compared with Grace and Read prompted London magazine Punch to print the following parody on Alfred, Lord Tennyson: ::Block, block, block ::At the foot of thy wicket, O Scotton! ::And I would that my tongue would utter ::My boredom. You won't put the pot on! ::Oh, nice for the bowler, my boy, ::That each ball like a barndoor you play! ::Oh, nice for yourself, I suppose, ::That you stick at the wicket all day! ::And the clock's slow hands go on, ::And you still keep up your sticks; ::But oh! for the lift of a smiting hand, ::And the sound of a swipe for six! ::Block, block, block, ::At the foot of thy wicket, ah do! ::But one hour of Grace or Walter Read ::Were worth a week of you! Scotton paid three visits to Australia, going out with Alfred Shaw's and Arthur Shrewsbury's teams in 1881, 1884 and 1886. In the three tours he averaged respectively in the eleven a-side matches, 20.8, 17.3, and 10.13. Scotton last played first-class cricket in 1891. He then played minor cricket and umpired. Scotton committed suicide on 9 July 1893 by slitting his throat with a razor.

It was originally a residence of the Nait≈ç family in the Edo period. Afterwards, it became a garden under the management of the Imperial Household Agency of Japan. It is now a national park under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of the Environment.  History  The sh≈çgun bequeathed this land to Lord Nait≈ç (daimy≈ç) of Tsuruga in the Edo period who completed a garden here in 1772.Mansfield. Page 15. After the Meiji Restoration the house and its grounds were converted into an experimental agricultural centre.Mansfield. Page 15. It then became a botanical garden before becoming an imperial garden in 1879. The current configuration of the garden was completed in 1906. Most of the garden was destroyed by air raids in 1945, during the later stages of World War II. The garden was rebuilt after the war. The jurisdiction over the Imperial Palace Outer Garden and the Kyoto imperial garden was transferred to the Ministry of Health and Welfare (now the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare) in 1947. On May 21, 1949, the garden became open to the public as a national park. It came under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of the Environment in January 2001, with the official English name \\"Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden\\". The official Japanese name remains Shinjuku Gyoen, where gyoen means \\"imperial garden\\". In 1989, the Shinjuku Gyoen was the site chosen for the funeral rites of Emperor Sh≈çwa before he was buried at the Musashi Imperial Graveyard. Features The garden, which is 58.3 hectares in area with a circumference of 3.5 km, blends three distinct styles: a French Formal and English Landscape in the north and to the south a Japanese traditional. A traditional Japanese tea house can be found within the gardens. The garden is a favourite hanami (cherry-blossom viewing) spot, and large crowds can be present during cherry blossom season. =Flora= The garden has more than 20,000 trees, including approximately 1,500 cherry trees which bloom from late March (Shidare or Weeping Cherry), to early April (Somei or Tokyo Cherry), and on to late April (Kanzan Cherry). Other trees found here include the majestic Himalayan cedars, which soar above the rest of the trees in the park, tulip trees, cypresses, and plane trees, which were first planted in Japan in the Imperial Gardens. Horticulture work has been going on in the greenhouses in the garden since 1892. The present greenhouse, built in the 1950s has a stock of over 1,700 tropical and subtropical plant species on permanent display. Entrances and admission The garden has three access gates: Shinjuku Gate, Okido Gate and Sendagaya Gate. Shinjuku Gyoen is open from 9:00 until 16:30. On Mondays the garden is closed, except during the cherry blossom and chrysanthemum seasons: late March-late April and early November respectively, when the garden is open seven days a week. The greenhouse is open from 9:30 until 16:00. The last admission is 16:00. Location The garden is a short walk from Shinjuku-gyoemmae Station on the Marunouchi Line or Sendagaya Station on the Ch≈´≈ç-S≈çbu Line. The garden is on the Tokyo Metro Fukutoshin Line near Shinjuku-sanch≈çme Station. From that station (exit C1) the garden is a four-minute walk. Shinjuku Gyoen should not be confused with Shinjuku Central Park, which is located behind the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building in Nishi-Shinjuku.

Auguste Victor Louis Verneuil (; 3 November 1856 ‚Äì 27 April 1913) was a French chemist best known for inventing the first commercially viable process for the manufacture of synthetic gemstones. In 1902 he discovered the \\"flame fusion\\" process, today called the Verneuil process, which remains in use today as an inexpensive means of making artificial corundum, or rubies and sapphires.  Biography  Verneuil was born in Dunkirk, France, in 1856. He was the son of a watchmaker-mechanic. When he was 17, chemist Edmond Fr√©my accepted him as a laboratory assistant. He received his bachelor's degree in 1875, his master's in 1880 and his PhD in 1886. In 1892 he became a professor of applied chemistry in the organic chemistry section of the Museum of Natural History in Paris, where he worked for 13 years. His first publication was with L. Bourgeois in 1880 on the preparation of crystalline hydrous iron arsenate. He studied methods to synthesize ruby, the chemistry of selenium, the phosphorescence of zincblende, the chemistry of rare earth elements, the purification of glycerine and the production of high refractive index glass. He also taught chemistry at various high schools and colleges. Verneuil began working on the synthesis of rubies by flame fusion as far back as 1886 and came to a result within six years, depositing his sealed notes at the Paris Academy of Science in 1891 and 1892, but only announcing his discovery in 1902.

Its large edible caterpillar, known as the madora or mopane worm or amacimbi, masontja, feeds primarily but not exclusively on mopane tree leaves. Mopane worms are an important source of protein for millions in the region. The species was first described by John O. Westwood in 1849. Vernacular names The mopane worm is so-called in English because it is usually found on the mopane tree, Colophospermum mopane. Other vernacular names for the caterpillars include: * Botswana ** Kalanga: mashonja ** * South Africa ** (colloq)On the trail of missing Mopane Worms.

Retrieved 28 March 2006. Identification The moths are large with a wingspan of 120 mm. Wings are fawn coloured through shades of green and brown to red, with two black and white bands isolating the eyespots. An orange eyespot is present on each hindwing. Males moths have feathery antennae, which are used to find a mate. Larvae are black, peppered with round scales in indistinct alternating whitish green and yellow bands, and armed with short black or reddish spines covered in fine white hairs. Mopane worm egg cluster Biology Larvae eat a wide range of plants including mopane, Carissa grandiflora, Diospyros, Ficus, Rhus, Sclerocarya caffra, Terminalia and Trema. Mopane worm outbreaks defoliate shrubs, depriving game of browse. Habitat Widespread. Very common in semi-desert, bushveld and grassland. Life cycle Like most caterpillars, the mopane worm's life cycle starts when it hatches in the summer, after which it proceeds to eat the foliage in its immediate vicinity. As the larva grows, it moults four times in its five larval stages, after which the mopane worm is considered most desirable for harvesting. Provided that the larva has not been harvested after its fourth moult, it burrows underground to pupate, the stage at which it undergoes complete transformation to become the adult moth. This stage happens over winter, for a duration of 6 to 7 months, whereafter it emerges at the beginning of summer (November or December). The adult moths live only for three to four days, during which time they mate and lay their eggs. Predators Mopane tree Mopane worm in a mopane tree Dried mopane leaves Like many animals lower down on the food chain, the mopane worms and their eggs often fall prey to various predators as well as disease. Often, more than 40% of a mopane worm's eggs will be attacked by various parasites, and the caterpillars themselves are susceptible to infection from a virus that has a high mortality rate. The worms' main predators are various birds and humans, which rely on the caterpillars for sustenance. Diet Although the mopane worm feeds chiefly on the mopane tree, it is not limited to this diet, and can feed on many other trees that are indigenous to the same regions, including the leaves of the mango tree. Thus the mopane worm is scattered over a fairly large area. As the larval stage of the mopane worm is fairly short, in contrast to other browsing caterpillars, the extensive damage to foliage is easily survived by the tree, in time to be replenished for the next generation of mopane worms. Like most caterpillars, the mopane worm is a voracious eater, and will continue to eat - almost non-stop - until it reaches the next stage of its life cycle, when it burrows underground to undergo metamorphosis. As food Mopane worms are hand picked in the wild, often by women and children. In the bush, the caterpillars are not considered to belong to the landowner (if any), but around a house, permission should be sought from the resident. Chavanduka describes women in Zimbabwe tying a piece of bark to particular trees to establish ownership, or moving the young caterpillars to trees nearer home.Chavunduka, D.M. 1975. Insects as a source of protein to the African. Rhodesia Science News 9: 217-220. (Quoted in ch.13 DeF 2003) When the caterpillar has been picked, it is pinched at the tail end to rupture the innards. The picker then squeezes it like a tube of toothpaste or lengthwise like a concertina, and whips it to expel the slimy, green contents of the gut. =Preserving= The traditional method of preserving mopane worms is to boil them without adding any extra water after washing and adding a significant amount of salt. They are then dried in the sun or smoked, whereby they gain extra flavour. The industrial method is to can the caterpillars (usually in brine). Tins of mopane worms can be found in rural supermarkets and markets around southern Africa. =Eating= Cooked mopane worms with onions Dried mopane worms can be eaten raw as a crisp snack; however, in Botswana people tend not to eat the head. Alternatively, mopane worms can be soaked to rehydrate, before being fried until they are crunchy, or cooked with onion, tomatoes and spices and then served with pap or sadza.Sikunu cookbook. Retrieved 28 March 2006. The flesh is yellow, and the gut may still contain fragments of dried leaf, which is not harmful to humans. The taste of dried leaves, if not removed, is somewhat reminiscent of tea leaves. Dried mopane worms are frequently canned/packaged in tomato sauce or chili sauce to enhance the flavour. In November 2015, a Cornell team of food scientists placed third in Brisbane, Australia, at the 2015 Global Business Challenge, by presenting the economic and nutritional benefits of transforming proteins from mopane worms into food. Farming and economics The harvesting and sale of mopane worms is a multi-million rand industry in southern Africa. The principal producers are Botswana, Namibia, South Africa (Limpopo Province and Mpumalanga) and Zimbabwe. Typically, the caterpillars are not bred, but picked wherever they occur naturally. It is one of the region's most economically important insects. In the 1990s, hundreds of tons were exported from Botswana and South Africa each year.A Concise Summary of the General Nutritional Value of Insects It is estimated that South Africa alone trades 1.6 million kilogrammes of mopane worm annually,Worming your way to a sustainable harvest Spore Brief Iss. 108 and that Botswana's involvement in this industry nets it roughly $8 million annually.Effects of Elevated Ultraviolet-B Radiation on Native and Cultivated Plants of Southern Africa Mopane worms are considered to be a profitable harvest, as a mere three kilograms of feed (mopane leaves) will generally yield one kilogram of mopane worms: in contrast, cattle farming requires ten kilograms of feed to generate one kilogram of beef; thus the worms are a low-cost, low-maintenance, high-protein food source. =Harvesting= Harvested mopane worms Traditionally, mopane worms were harvested for subsistence. Because of the seasonal nature of the occurrence of these edible caterpillars, they are not a year-round food source. However, traditional mopane worm harvesting is evolving to be more commercially driven. Since the 1950s, commercial farming methods have been applied to the mopane worm harvests, particularly in South Africa. Collectors may organise teams of hundreds of people to hand pick the caterpillars from the trees, after which they are bagged en masse, weighed, and sent off to be processed. Owners of land where mopane worms are found may charge harvesters large fees to enter. Whereas this relationship profits both the commercial harvester and the farmer, it is often to the detriment of the local community for whom the caterpillars may previously have been an important source of food and seasonal income. =Sustainability= As mopane worms represent an important sector in the local rural economy, they attract large numbers of people who seek to cash in on the profits from selling the insects as food. This circumstance leads to overharvesting, and fewer mopane worms the following year. In some areas, farmers and communities have taken steps to reach a balance, so that each year may yield maximum returns without compromising the following year's harvest. Fears of competition A sure sign of the presence of mopane worms is defoliation of mopane woodland - sometimes around ninety per cent of leaves. Fenced-in browsing animals may rely on the mopane, and on other trees favoured by the caterpillars, as an important part of their diet. Some farmers therefore view the mopane worm as competition for their livestock, and attempt to eradicate the \\"pest\\" with insecticides and the like. However, the caterpillar season is short, and the trees sprout the new, tender foliage which browsers prefer, so this problem can be managed in other ways, for example, by working to mutual benefit with the local caterpillar harvesters who will control the worms by harvesting them. Recolonisation Some areas once rich in mopane worms are now barren due to over harvesting and lack of a proper sustainable approach to commercial mopane worm farming. A good case is in Nkayi District, Zimbabwe, where most mopane woodland areas once produced a high population of these worms; but the harvests have decreased drastically. Suggestions of how to reintroduce the worms to these areas include re-colonisation. As the adult moth lives only three to four days, during which it must mate and lay eggs, there is only a small window of opportunity to relocate them. If this stage was to be successfully completed, collaboration with local farmers and communities would be required to ensure that the caterpillars are not harvested for a set number of years. It would thus be ensured that the area is adequately repopulated, so that a sustainable harvest is created for the future. Domestication Those in the business have considered domesticating the mopane worms in a manner that is similar to the domestication of silkworms. The industry would thus be less susceptible to the pitfalls that are associated with it, such as climate change, drought and other factors that could compromise a harvest. For a domesticated industry to succeed on a small scale and be accessible to the poorest of the poor, the cost of production would have to be comparable with the cost of wild worms or dried worms at the market.

They are among the fastest birds in the world. They resemble swallows, to which they are not related, but have shorter tails and sickle-shaped wings. Swifts spend most of their life aloft, have very short legs and use them mostly to cling to surfaces. Taxonomy The genus Apus was erected by the Italian naturalist Giovanni Antonio Scopoli in 1777 based on tautonymy and the common swift which had been given the binomial name Hirundo apus by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758. The name Apus is Latin for a swift, thought by the ancients to be a type of swallow with no feet (from Ancient Greek Œ±, a, \\"without\\", and œÄŒøœçœÇ, pous, \\"foot\\"). Before the 1950s, there was some controversy over which group of organism should have the genus name Apus. In 1801 Bosc gave the small crustacean organisms known today as Triops the genus name Apus, and later authors continued to use this term. Keilhack suggested (in 1909) that this was incorrect since there was already an avian genus named Apus by Scopoli in 1777 . It was not until 1958 that the controversy finally ended when the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) ruled against the use of the genus name Apus and instead recognized the term Triops. Species The genus contains 20 species: * Cape Verde swift, Apus alexandri * Common swift, Apus apus * Plain swift, Apus unicolor * Nyanza swift, Apus niansae * Pallid swift, Apus pallidus * African black swift, Apus barbatus * Malagasy black swift, Apus balstoni * Fernando Po swift Apus sladeniae * Forbes- Watson's swift, Apus berliozi * Bradfield's swift, Apus bradfieldi * Pacific swift, Apus pacificus * Salim Ali's swift, Apus salimalii * Blyth's swift, Apus leuconyx * Cook's swift, Apus cooki * Dark-rumped swift, Apus acuticauda * Little swift, Apus affinis * House swift, Apus nipalensis * Horus swift, Apus horus * White-rumped swift, Apus caffer * Bates's swift Apus batesi Known fossil species are: *Apus gaillardi (Middle/Late Miocene of La Grive- St.-Alban, France) *Apus wetmorei (Early - Late Pliocene? of SC and SE Europe) *Apus baranensis (Late Pliocene of SE Europe) *Apus submelba (Middle Pleistocene of Slovakia) The Miocene \\"Apus\\" ignotus is now placed in Procypseloides.

Wado kai has numerous associated organizations and member clubs on different continents of the world. History In 1938 Hironori Ohtsuka registered his mixed style of karate-jujutsu with the Dai Nippon Butoku Kai, originally under the name of Shinshu Wadoryu Karate- Jujutsu, soon shortened to Wado-ryu (ÂíåÈÅìÊµÅ). A Wadoryu Honbu (headquarters) was established in the Meiji University dojo in Tokyo, Japan in 1952. The Shintani Wado Kai Karate Federation of North America officially joined Otsuka's federation in 1958. In 1964 the Japan Karatedo Federation (JKF) was established as a general organization for all karate styles. Wado joined this organization as a major group. The Wado organization changed the name to Wadokai on 5 June 1967. On 15 November 1979 Hironori Otsuka promoted Masaru Shintani to 8th dan, and presented him with a 9th dan certificate at the same time and appointed Shintani Sensei the Supreme Instructor of Wado Karate in North America. Wadokai remained relatively intact as an organisation until around 1980, when a split occurred. The split occurred because the Wadokai board of directors and Hironori Ohtsuka had a difference in opinion about monetary expenditures and accessibility to the funds of the organization. Ohtsuka felt it was within his rights to have full use of the Federation funds and one day made a withdrawal that drew the ire of the board of directors. This matter was settled out of court and the terms of the settlement allowed him to keep the money but he had to resign from Wadokai and he also lost all rights to the name and logo of the organization. Eiichi Eriguchi succeeded him within Wadokai at that time and again became Chairman during the 1990s. Hironori Ohtsuka then founded Wadoryu Karatedo Renmei (Renmei means 'group' or 'federation') on 1 April 1981. After only a few months Hironori Ohtsuka retired as head of this organization and his son Jiro Ohtsuka took his place. Hironori Ohtsuka died 29 January 1982 at the age of 89. In 1983 Jiro Ohtsuka became Grandmaster of Wado Ryu and changed his name to Hironori Ohtsuka, in honor of his father. He is now often referred to as Hironori Ohtsuka II. Tatsuo Suzuki founded his own organization in 1991, the third major Wado organization: Wado Kokusai. Kokusai means 'international.' Organization's name According to Ishizuka Akira, a veteran figure in the Japanese karate world, the term Wado Kai was in general use as early as the 1940s, but it was only in 1967 that the name was adopted formally. Prior to this the group was known as the Zen Nihon Karate-do Renmei. With the formation of the Federation of All Japan Karatedo Organization (FAJKO, later changed to JKF) in the mid 60's, it was no longer correct to use this name so Wadokai came into formal use. The term Wadokai can be broken into three parts: Wa, do and kai. Wa can be read to mean 'harmony' but also as \\"original Japan\\", allowing a pun in the name. Do is a Japanese term for 'way' (as in karate-do). So Wado means 'the way of (Japanese) harmony'. Kai simply means 'association'. =Different Wado names= The full name of the Japanese Wadokai federation in English is Japan Karatedo Federation Wadokai. In Japanese it is Zen Nihon Karatedo Renmei Wadokai. Nowadays the full name of Wadoryu is Wadoryu Karatedo Renmei. The full name of Wado Kokusai is Wado Kokusai Karatedo Renmei, also known as Wado International Karatedo Federation abbreviated as WIKF. Strictly speaking Hironori Ohtsuka founded and developed Wado Ryu. The people who trained with him became the Wado group or Wadokai. So today, the style that is trained within Wadokai is Wado Ryu. The Wadoryu Renmei people (Jiro Ohtsuka's group) sometimes referred their style as Wadoryu Jujutsu Kenpo to assert their emphasis in the Jujutsu roots of Wado. Currently Wadokai and Wadoryu have spread to several other countries under the governing bodies in Japan.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on February 27, 1992. In the episode, Springfield Elementary School students take career aptitude tests. When Lisa learns she is best suited to be a homemaker, her dreams of being a professional musician are shattered and she becomes a delinquent troublemaker at school. When Bart finds he would make a good policeman, his grades and behavior improve and Principal Skinner makes him hall monitor. The episode was written by George Meyer and directed by Jeffrey Lynch. American actor and television personality Steve Allen guest starred in the episode as the electronically altered voice of Bart in a fantasy sequence. Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. It acquired a Nielsen Rating of 14.8 and was the highest-rated show on Fox the week it aired. Plot After a malfunctioning computer scrambles the results of career aptitude tests, Lisa learns she is best suited to be a homemaker. Heartbroken, she tries to prove the test results are wrong and consults a music teacher. He tells her she has inherited her father's stubby fingers and can never be a professional saxophone player. Lisa dreads spending the day doing household chores with her mother. Realizing her dreams are shattered, she also loses interest in being a good student and rebels. When Bart's test shows he would make an ideal cop, he goes for a police ride-along with Eddie and Lou and helps apprehend Snake during a car chase. When Principal Skinner discovers Bart's new interest in law enforcement, he makes him hall monitor. Bart issues demerits to students for minor infractions and restores order to the school. Lisa encounters two delinquent students smoking in the bathroom and suggests they TP Skinner's beloved school mascot, a puma. When Lisa steals all the teachers' editions of textbooks and reveals their lack of smarts, Bart finds his sister is the culprit. Bart takes the blame for her, returning to his life as a bad student and detention regular. Lisa is reformed as a good student. While Bart is in detention, Lisa consoles him by playing her saxophone outside the classroom. Production Steve Allen guest stars. The episode was written by George Meyer and directed by Jeffrey Lynch. Mike Reiss, show runner of The Simpsons with Al Jean at the time, said Meyer wrote most of the episode by himself without help from the show's other writers. Few changes were made to the first draft that he pitched to the producers; it was near identical to the final script. The episode was inspired by the vocational tests taken by several members of the show's staff when they went to school; Reiss, for example, said he was told he would become a librarian. Jean said \\"one of the first things that sold us on doing the episode\\" was the idea of Bart becoming a policeman. He said it was \\"a funny, realistic depiction of what a kid like Bart might wind up to become, and it wasn't something you would immediately think of\\". Jean said the episode deals with the emotion that many adults feel when they grow older and realize they are not going to achieve the dreams they once had. \\"[It's about] how people in life cope with that problem. Maybe Lisa, at eight years old, is a little bit young to worry about that, but that's what we were trying to explore here.\\" In one sequence Bart imagines himself testifying in court, with his voice electronically altered. The altered voice was provided by American actor and television personality Steve Allen. Series creator Matt Groening said he and some of the writers who were old enough to remember Allen's TV show from the 1950s‚Äì60s were thrilled to have him guest-star, especially John Swartzwelder. It took nine takes for Allen to pronounce Bart's catchphrase \\"¬°Ay, caramba!\\" correctly, to the point where the staff began to get slightly frustrated with him. There was a discussion amongst the writing team of whether the episode should end with a joke or have a \\"sweet\\" ending. Reiss said \\"With the better angels in our nature, we went with the sweet ending [of Lisa playing her saxophone for Bart].\\" Cultural references The music school that Lisa visits has a sign out front with a picture of a diapered baby Ludwig van Beethoven on it. When Principal Skinner is questioning Lisa about her newfound sense of irresponsibility, he asks \\"What are you rebelling against?\\" She responds \\"Whaddaya got?\\", like Marlon Brando's character Johnny Strabler did in the film The Wild One. She also has a toothpick in her mouth, like Johnny had in the film.. The fifth graders whom Lisa talks to in the school washroom are smoking Laramie cigarettes. The car chase scene with Snake is a reference to the car chase scene in the 1968 film Bullitt. Music similar to the soundtrack of the television series The Streets of San Francisco is heard in the scene. Alf Clausen, a composer on The Simpsons who had previously worked on several police shows, wrote the music for the scene. In another reference to The Streets of San Francisco and other Quinn Martin productions, a voice- over and caption proclaims the name of act two of the episode, \\"Act II - Death Drives a Stick\\", after the episode's first act break in the middle of the Snake car chase. In the sequence where Bart imagines himself testifying in court, his face is obscured with a blue dot; this is a references to the television coverage of the rape trial of William Kennedy Smith, in which the woman who accused Smith of raping her was obscured with a blue dot over her face. The way the scene changes from Bart and Skinner talking in Skinner's office to them searching through the lockers is a reference to the same style of scene change used in the 1960s Batman television series, in which a close- up of Batman's face with dramatic music in the background is shown for a brief moment before the scene changes. The song heard when Bart and Skinner search through the lockers for the Teachers' Editions is a variation of Harold Faltermeyer's \\"AxelF\\" from the film Beverly Hills Cop. Analysis In the last scene of the episode, Bart is seen writing \\"I will not expose the ignorance of the faculty\\" on the blackboard as a punishment for exposing the ignorance of the teachers by removing the Teachers' Editions. In his book The Small Screen: How Television Equips Us to Live in the Information Age, Brian L. Ott describes this scene as one of the \\"key ways The Simpsons appeals to audience, which tends to be younger, by critiquing authority figures, and in particular educators\\". Toby Daspit and John Weaver write in their book Popular Culture and Critical Pedagogy: Reading, Constructing, Connecting that the writers of The Simpsons are \\"particularly interested\\" in questions about authority and the abuses of powers in school. Another scene from the episode sees Ms. Hoover telling the students to stare at the blackboard for fifteen minutes until class is over. Daspit and Weaver write that it is \\"the absolute power that teachers have over students' every action that allows for the image to be presented on The Simpsons. It would be comforting to tell ourselves that this is simply parody run amok, that the writers are stretching reality to make a point, but the discussants in the study [of The Simpsons in this book] had memories of a reality very much like the one presented in this program.\\" One of the discussants said she believes everyone has experienced similar situations in their school years, and she thinks the thought that \\"an educator could ever do something so useless and pointless with the children's time\\" is \\"frightening\\". Reception Nancy Cartwright won an Emmy for her performance as Bart. In its original American broadcast, \\"Separate Vocations\\" finished 29th in the ratings for the week of February 24‚ÄìMarch 1, 1992, with a Nielsen Rating of 14.8, equivalent to approximately 13.6 million viewing households. It was the highest-rated show on Fox that week. Nancy Cartwright won an Emmy for her outstanding performance as Bart. Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, thought the episode displayed The Simpsons \\"at its best ‚Äì not only hilarious but daringly outspoken on a whole range of issues ‚Äì the failures of the education system, police abuses of power, the stifling of children's creativity\\". Bill Gibron of DVD Verdict said \\"Separate Vocations\\" represents The Simpsons \\"at its apex as a well tuned talent machine grinding out the good stuff with surprising accuracy and skill\\". Gibron added that the episode shows that \\"even in territory they're not used to (Bart as a safety patrol, Lisa as a cursing class cut up), the Simpsons' kids are funny and inventive\\". Nate Meyers of Digitally Obsessed rated the episode a four (out of five) and commented that the script's \\"departure from the traditional roles assigned to Bart and Lisa makes for a fresh experience with many laughs\\". Meyers thought the highlight of the episode was Bart's ride in the police car. DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson thought the theme of the episode was unoriginal, but commented that Bart's \\"rapid embrace of fascism\\" and Lisa's \\"descent into hooliganism\\" provide \\"a number of funny opportunities, and 'Separate Vocations' exploits them well. Though it's not one of the year's best shows, it seems like a good one for the most part.\\" References External links *\\"Separate Vocations\\" at The Simpsons.com \\"Separate Vocations\\" at TV.com Category:The Simpsons (season 3) episodes Category:1992 American television episodes ","title":"Separate Vocations"},{"id":"2439539","text":"Mordac may refer to: * Mordac, Earl of Menteith, in 12th century Scotland * Mordac, \\"Preventer of Information Services\\", a character in Dilbert * Mordac, a character in Flanders (film) * MoRDAC, the layout engine used in UZard Web ","title":"Mordac"},{"id":"2439547","text":"VGT may refer to: * Flemish Sign Language (Vlaamse Gebarentaal), the language used by signers in Flanders * North Las Vegas Airport (IATA code: VGT), an airport located three nautical miles (6 km) NW of the central business district of Las Vegas * Variable-geometry turbocharger, a family of turbochargers usually designed with variable aspect ratios * Video Gaming Technologies, an American supplier of gambling machines * Virtual Global Taskforce, a group of law enforcement agencies from around the world working together to fight child pornography online *Vision Gran Turismo, a series of concept cars created by automakers for the Gran Turismo video game series ","title":"VGT"},{"id":"2439548","text":"Branimir \\"Johnny\\" ≈†tuliƒá (born 11 April 1953) is a Yugoslav singer-songwriter, musician and author, best known for being the frontman of the popular former Yugoslav rock group Azra. He is known for his charismatic stage performances and inspiring song lyrics that often combined rock poetry with a strong sense for social commentary, becoming a cult figure. Early life ≈†tuliƒá was born on 11 April, 1953, in Skopje, where his mother Slavica (n√©e Milovac) and father Ivan ≈†tuliƒá ‚Äì an officer in the Yugoslav People's Army ‚Äì were stationed at the time. His paternal Croatian family originates from Nin, being one of the oldest families from the town. At the age of seven, ≈†tuliƒá moved with his family to Jastrebarsko. In January 1967, ≈†tuliƒá moved to Zagreb where he attended high school and later, for two years, studied phonetics and history at the University of Zagreb's Faculty of Philosophy before dropping out. Music career He began his musical career with a band named \\"Balkan Sevdah band\\", performing beside own songs also The Beatles covers and folk music. The name was changed to Azra in 1977. The initial line up which included Jura Stubliƒá, Marino Pelajiƒá and Mladen Juriƒçiƒá soon dissolved, and they formed another popular band Film. During the 1980s, became one of the most prominent and influential musical acts in Yugoslavia. The Azra days brought ≈†tuliƒá widespread fame in Yugoslavia, as well as a rabid and devoted youth following ‚Äì ≈†tuliƒá often used his music as commentary directed towards the social and political conditions in the then-Socialist Yugoslavia. He has been living in the Netherlands since 1986. From 1989 performed under his name with live support of \\"Sevdah Shuttle Band\\", and released solo studio albums Balkanska rapsodija (1989) and Balegari ne vjeruju sreƒái (1990). When it became obvious to him that Yugoslavia will collapse, ≈†tuliƒá in 1991 in Sarajevo recorded the album Sevdah za Paulu Horvat (released in 1995), documentary Das ist Johnny in which the most memorable moment was when viewed from the window of Sarajevo hotel room and concluded that soon all would burn, and his alleged last visit of the territory was in 1995 in Belgrade, where he produced album Anali and promoted book Bo≈æanska Ilijada. In regards to the Yugoslav war, ≈†tuliƒá frequently expressed his disapproval of separatism and was a fervent believer of Yugoslavism and Brotherhood and unity. He commented that \\"I have no passport, no money and have no place to go back. I had a Yugoslav one and it expired. Yugoslavia is no more, it's the same as when you are born and you are told: this is your dad, this is your mother, because, according to Homer, no one knows, when they are born, who gave birth to them, at least the first three years. And now I do not have my parents and that's why I'm happy\\". After the ex-Yugo wars ended in 1995, ≈†tuliƒá recorded two solo albums, both published in Belgrade, Serbia, with the last Blase in 1997. Life in the Netherlands In 2005 he published an autobiography called \\"Smijurija u mjerama\\", with mixed to positive reception. Hrvoje Horvat, a Croatian journalist, wrote a biography of Johnny ≈†tuliƒá titled \\"Fantom slobode\\", (\\"The Phantom of Freedom\\"), published in 2006. Due to ≈†tuliƒá's immense popularity in the former Yugoslavia, the book was an immediate commercial success. However, it was also heavily criticized by many literary critics, and even ≈†tuliƒá himself, for its sometime poor writing quality and alleged misinterpretation of facts. Ines Pletikos directed documentary film Kad Miki ka≈æe da se boji (2004), while Kruno Petrinoviƒá a book, Prilozi za biografiju Johnnyja B. ≈†tuliƒáa (2006), about the heroes of his poems. Today, ≈†tuliƒá lives a modest and ascetic lifestyle in Houten, Netherlands, with wife Josephine Grundmeiyer. He typically does not give interviews and is very protective of his privacy. He states he has no interest in going back to his rock career, but in the past few years he has recorded and posted on YouTube over 600 traditional songs, hit covers and some original material. He works on the Serbo-Croatian translation of many ancient and medieval works. In 2012 initiated a lawsuit against Croatia Records from Zagreb, the direct successor of Jugoton, over royalty rights, as well book publisher from Belgrade, for copyright infringement. In revolt to the statements made by music editor from the Croatia Records and former Jugoton, ≈†tuliƒá stated that Azra is not a Croatian band and that he is not a Croat, nor the child of a Serbo-Croatian marriage. In the Serbian public it was seen as a reason to proclaim him as a Serbian, however, his lack of declared ethnic affiliation through his career (from Croat to Macedonian, Bosnian, Bogomil, Illyrian, Balkanian) is considered to be related to his revolt of being identified with any of the nations who would start the Yugoslav war. About appearing in Croatia he said that he does not want to perform in occupied territories, and regarding an issue of him not having a valid passport he declined both Croatian and Serbian passport and citizenship.

Biju Patnaik Airport , also known as the Bhubaneswar Airport, is the primary airport serving Bhubaneswar, the capital city of Odisha. It is situated around south-west from Bhubaneswar railway station and away from the city center. Named after the former chief minister of Odisha, Biju Patnaik, a famed aviator and freedom fighter, it is the 16th busiest airport in India & 11th busiest among the airports maintained by Airports Authority of India, registering a 11.7% fall in traffic over the previous year. History The airport was dedicated to the people of Odisha on 17 April 1962, becoming the first ever commercial airport in the state. The airport boasts two active scheduled passenger terminals i.e. Terminals 1 and 2 for domestic and international passengers respectively. Former Minister of Civil Aviation, Ajit Singh, on 5 March 2013, inaugurated Terminal 1 which caters to domestic passengers whereas Terminal 2 was then refurbished to handle international operations. The Government of India accorded international status to the airport on 30 October 2013. Terminals Biju Patnaik Airport serves as one of the major civil aviation hubs in Eastern India. The airport boasts two active scheduled passenger terminals i.e. Terminals 1 and 2 for domestic and international passengers respectively. =Terminal 1= Traditional Masks at Terminal 1 Interior of Terminal 1 Inaugurated in March 2013, the terminal has a capacity of 4 million passengers per annum and was built at a cost of 1.45 billion by Lanco Infratech. The new terminal has been developed by the AAI as part of the upgrade of 35 non-metro airports across the country. Terminal T1, a two-storied building with a total area of , consists of 4 aerobridges, 4 elevators, several escalators, 18 check-in counters, 3 arrival luggage conveyors, a spa, and multiple seating areas. Apart from the Departure and Arrival Lounges, T1 terminal also has several other lounges, including VIP Lounges, Pal Heights Spa Lounge, Dakota Lounge and Mayfair Lounge. The terminal is environment-friendly, built according to green building standards, with sewage treatment plants and provision for rain water harvesting. The internal walls of the terminal are decorated with tribal motifs, designs, masks, and sculptures derived from Odisha's culture. The new terminal also has food kiosks, gift shops, bookstores, art galleries and handloom/handicraft kiosks. =Terminal 2= Terminal 2 handles international operations to and from the airport. It was built in the mid 1960s to cater domestic flights. The terminal being built over an area of , consists of 6 check-in counters, 10 immigration counters, 4 customs counters, numerous amenities and multiple seating areas. A link building connecting Terminal 1 and 2 is being constructed with a budget of 872 million. It will be mostly used for international arrivals. =Terminal 3= Terminal 3, is a proposed passenger terminal, to be set up at a cost of 9.13 billion with a total area of . The terminal would handle 8 million passengers per annum, expanding Biju Patnaik International Airport's capacity to 11.5 million from 3.5 million passengers per annum. The construction work for the terminal is poised to begin in July 2019, with a given construction duration of three years. This terminal, once completed would handle domestic passengers, and the existing terminals 1 and 2 would then cater international passengers. Coast Guard Air Enclave The Coast Guard Air Enclave along with the 743 Dornier Squadron was commissioned by former Vice-Admiral Anurag G Thapliyal, Director General of the Indian Coast Guard in Biju Patnaik International Airport on 15 December 2014. The units operate under the operational and administrative control of the Commander of the Coast Guard Region (North East) through the Commander, Coast Guard District No 7 (Odisha). Several strategic air operations are streamlined and synergised for the protection of the sea areas off the Coastal Odisha.

Recreating the Eastern Front during World War II, Eastern Front covers the historical area of operations during the 1941‚Äì1942 period. The player commands German units at the corps level as they invade the Soviet Union in 1941 and fight the computer-controlled Russians. The game simulates terrain, weather, supplies, unit morale, and fatigue. A killer app for Atari computers, Eastern Front was among APX's best selling games of all time, ultimately selling over 60,000 copies. It was widely lauded in the press, won Creative Computings Game of the Year award in 1981, and was licensed by Atari for distribution on game cartridge. Gameplay Opening scene in the original Eastern Front, showing the region around Leningrad. Eastern Front is a corps- level simulation of Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. The player controls the Germans, in white, while the computer plays the Russians, in red. Units are represented as boxes for armored corps or cavalry, and crosses for infantry, an attempt to replicate conventional military symbols given the low resolution. Using 18 colors, the screen shows only of the entire map at one time, smooth-scrolling around it when the joystick-controlled cursor reaches the edges of the screen.White, pg. 22 According to creator Chris Crawford, it is the first wargame with a smooth- scrolling map.Crawford, pg. 131Chris Crawford, \\"Ga-Ga over Graphics\\", Works and Days, Volume 22 Issue 43/44 (2004), pg. 113 The map covers the area from just north of Leningrad at the top to Sevastopol at the bottom, and from Warsaw on the left to just east of Stalingrad on the right. The terrain is varied, including flatland, forests, mountains, rivers and swamps, each with their own effects on movement. Cities are displayed in white, and are a major source of \\"victory points\\", the player's score. The game is modal, switching between an order entry mode and a combat mode. During order entry the joystick is used to select units and enter movement in the four cardinal directions. Up to eight orders can be entered for any unit. Orders are remembered from turn to turn, and new orders can be added in future turns after watching an animation of any remaining ones. The orders for any given unit can be cancelled by pressing the . After entering orders, the combat phase begins with . Units attempt to follow their orders to the greatest extent possible, delayed by terrain, blocking friendly units, or combat with enemy units. The screen shows combat by flashing the \\"attacked\\" unit, which might be forced to retreat, or be destroyed outright. When all possible movement and combat is exhausted, the game returns to the order-entry phase. Each turn represents one week in-game time, and the game ends on 29 March 1942, after 41 turns. The game engine includes a number of features that increases the depth of the simulation compared to contemporary wargames, such as zones of control, which allows front lines to be constructed without requiring contiguous lines of units. This includes muster and combat strengths, which simulates losses due to combat, and reinforcements that slowly returns a unit to muster strength over time. Supply lines are also simulated, and surrounding the enemy to cut off their supplies is an important strategy for the human player, who faces an overwhelming enemy numerical superiority. The game simulates the changing of the seasons: 14 turns of summer that begin in June 1941, four turns of autumn, and 22 turns of winter. Autumn begins on 5 October 1941, and the green land changes to purple-brown mud. The player is likely losing if he has not by then captured most objectives, destroyed most early Russian forces, and established a defensive position. The player scores victory points by moving German forces east, capturing Moscow, Leningrad, Stalingrad, and Sevastopol, and destroying and pushing Russian forces east. The highest possible score is 255, and the documentation suggests that any score above 100 is good. Computer Gaming World estimated that the actual German army in 1941 scored 110 to 120. A high score by early autumn is not difficult but keeping it high during winter is almost impossible, as mud and snow appears, rivers and land gradually freeze during winter, and Russians counterattack; until the spring thaw the German side is forced into a purely defensive role. If the player survives until spring the season offers a renewed offensive capability, but only for a short period before the game ends. =Artificial intelligence= In an example of pondering, the computer AI calculates its moves during the period between vertical blank interrupts (VBI). The rest of the game, what the user sees, is run during the VBI period of a few hundred cycles. According to Crawford in Chris Crawford on Game Design, the system starts with a basic \\"plan\\" and then applies any available cycles to trying variations on that plan, selecting higher-valued outcomes. A few thousand cycles are available between each VBI, so given a typical order-entry phase of a minute, the computer has millions of cycles to spend on refining its plan. The AI is based on three basic measures of the game state: The strategic situation which attempts to take and hold cities, the tactical situation which attempts to block player movements, and the overall arrangement of the front line.Overview from examining the source code, available below. The AI first attempts to build a continuous front line in an attempt to prevent encirclements, it then sends additional units on intercept courses to block player movements, and finally any remaining units are sent to undefended cities. As Germany, the player begins with more-mobile units, shorter supply lines, and concentrated forces. Although the AI is not strong‚Äîbelieving that the computer needed help against a human, Crawford intentionally did not fix a bug that benefits the Russian side‚Äîthe computer has greater numbers, much more territory, and winter weather. Because of pondering, the computer's moves become better the longer the player waits before issuing orders each turn; the computer's larger forces allow it to put up a credible defense. Direct fights are hopeless for the player, as newly arriving Soviet units eventually overwhelm the German forces. Crawford spent much time tuning the arrival times of new units to balance the gameplay, and warned that a player who attempted to overwhelm the Russians with tanks is \\"guaranteed to lose. What you are supposed to do is maneuver, encircle, demoralize, and defeat\\". The manual advises using blitzkrieg; use the mobile armored units to break through and encircle Russian units, and infantry units to eliminate enemy pockets. According to Crawford, Eastern Front is an example of a game with a sharp jump in the learning curve; \\"apparently there is just one trick in the game, mastery of which guarantees mastery of the game\\". While he did not specify the trick, there are ways to trick the AI. One is to break the German forces into two blocks, and then advance them on alternate turns. The tactical part of the AI attempts to intercept these movements, sending its mobile forces first one way, then the other, never actually making contact. Another strategy is to keep flanking forces behind a spearhead, which the AI would attempt to block. This results in the computer forces clumping up in front of the Germans, allowing the wings to move in once motion was difficult. Players exploited another bug in the first version's game engine. Since the AI calculates its moves while the user enters orders, reducing the amount of time the user takes to plan their own moves reduces the quality of the computer response. Repeatedly pressing prevents the computer from pondering and neither the player nor computer does anything, avoiding combat during the winter and allowing the player to break out during spring with full-strength units. Development and versions After writing Tanktics, which simulated German and Soviet tank battles during World War II, Crawford wrote the first version of what he called Ourrah Pobieda (Russian for \\"Horray, Victory!\\") in May and June 1979 on a Commodore PET using Commodore BASIC. The game was at the time a division-level simulation of combat on the Eastern Front. He described the initial version as \\"dull, confusing, and slow\\", and did not return to the project for 15 months. After he began working for Atari, in September 1980 he saw a fellow employee demonstrate smooth scrolling in a text window on an Atari 8-bit and realized the technique's potential for a war game. By December he produced a smoothly scrolling map of Russia, in January 1981 produced a written description of the design for what he by now envisioned as a \\"48K disk-based game with fabulous graphics\\" written in assembly language, and began working 20 hours a week during nights and weekends to produce a demonstrable game by the Origins Convention in July. Crawford first playtested the game in May and again found it disappointing. To simplify the project, he reduced the game's scope from the entire 1941-1945 campaign to just the first year; introduced zones of control to reduce the number of units and the burden on the computer's artificial intelligence; and added logistics, which permitted encirclement. Crawford also found that the game fit into 16K RAM instead of 48K, and maintained the size. He distributed the game to other playtesters in June, demonstrated a playable version at Origins, then further refined the game for six weeks by fixing bugs and adjusting game balance. Crawford estimated in 1987 that he had worked a total of 800 hours on Eastern Front, and believed that the game had influenced the industry to simplify user interfaces and prove that there was a market for an \\"intelligent\\", non-action game. Crawford approached Atari about selling the game, but the company believed that wargames for Atari computers would not be popular.Hague, see \\"Why was \\"Eastern Front\\" released through the Atari Program Exchange?\\" Atari Program Exchange (APX), a separate Atari unit that distributed third-party applications, published it on disk and tape. Renamed Eastern Front shortly before release, APX began selling the game in August 1981. It was immediately successful, selling over 60,000 copies with in royalties to Crawford.Crawford, pg. 257 By June 1982 it was APX's best seller; APX's manager later said that Eastern Front and De Re Atari \\"paid the bills, i.e. were our biggest sellers\\".Kevin Savetz, \\"Fred Thorlin: The Big Boss at Atari Program Exchange\\", April 2000 Crawford stated in 1987 that the game had been the most lucrative for him \\"by at least a factor of four\\", and in 1992 that it had sold \\"fabulously well ‚Äî far better than anybody (myself included) expected\\", with most purchasers not traditional wargamers. Screenshot of cartridge version of Eastern Front (1941). This is the starting position for the 1942 scenario, the Russians having contained the Germans southwest of Moscow. Smolensk is centered just above the square pink cursor, with Minsk on the left and Orel in the lower right. A Russian infantry unit covers Moscow near the upper edge of the map. The game was so successful that Atari asked Crawford to convert it to ROM cartridge as an official Atari product. To improve the gameplay he revamped the AI code, and eliminated the ability to \\"fast forward\\" the game and avoid combat. Five difficulty levels are added, the \\"learner\\" mode with a single German unit in order to teach the user how to use the controls, and each level above that adding more units up to \\"advanced\\", which is identical to the original game. In the highest level, \\"expert\\", air force corps (') are added, and the units can be placed in one of several modes; normal, assault, or defend and move. In \\"expert\\" the user can also choose to start in either 1941 with the standard opening, or 1942, with fully developed lines deep within Russia. The new version also adds the ability to save and restore games, colored cities to indicate ownership, and added city names (previously visible only in the manual) to the in-game map. The conversion from APX to official Atari product was rare, although Caverns of Mars and Dandy underwent similar conversions for the same reasons. Crawford used many of the ideas from Eastern Front in Legionnaire for Avalon Hill in 1982. Legionnaire uses the same map engine to simulate the Roman legions fighting the barbarians, but modifies it to move units in real time.DeWitt, pg. 34 Reception Eastern Front received critical praise from contemporary magazines. Computer Gaming World in 1981 called it \\"to this date, the most impressive computer wargame on the market\\". The review praised the graphics and the artificial intelligence, noted its pondering, and suggested that the game was a killer app for Atari computers. Six years later the magazine still rated the game five out of five points, stating \\"obsolete by contemporary programming standards, it is still fun to play\\", and in 1993 rated the game four stars out of five. Creative Computing called Eastern Front \\"one of the very best war games available for a personal computer ... nearly every aspect of the game is a technical masterpiece\\", praising its artificial intelligence and \\"magnificent\\" scrolling map. The magazine concluded that it was \\"also a virtuoso demonstration of the awesome built-in capabilities of the Atari computer. This game literally could not be done on any other computer in as satisfactory an execution\\". Atari magazine Antic called Eastern Front \\"a game master piece, a brilliant simulation of battle conditions on the eastern front in WW II.\\" ANALOG Computing rated the game 9.3 out of 10, calling it \\"truly magnificent\\". Citing time pressure as a difference from board games, COMPUTE! called Eastern Front \\"a paradigm for computer war games\\" and praised its graphics and gameplay, with the only major criticism being the inability to save and restore a game. InfoWorld rated it \\"Excellent\\" overall in December 1981,David Cortesi, \\"Eastern Front (1941), wargame from Atari Exchange\\", InfoWorld, December 7, 1981, pf. 34 and later referred to it as one of \\"the deepest computer games around.\\"Mace, pg. 34 BYTE stated that Eastern Front \\"is possibly the first fun war game for people who hate war games\\". The Addison-Wesley Book of Atari Software 1984 gave the game an overall A rating, calling it \\"perhaps the best- designed computer war game to appear on any microcomputer to date\\" and praising the graphics and joystick-driven user interface. The book concluded that it \\"is the first war game that non-warriors might enjoy ... Highly recommended.\\" Creative Computing named Eastern Front Game of the Year in 1981.DeWitt, pg. 56 The Academy of Adventure Gaming Arts and Design named it Best Adventure Game for Home Computer, 1981. In 1987 Crawford stated that it was one of the three games he was proud of, with Legionnaire and Balance of Power. In 2002 GameSpy wrote that Eastern Front was considered to be one of the first computer wargames that paper-and-pencil wargamers approved of.  Legacy  While the game was still being sold, Crawford released its source code through APX as a separate, commercial product targeted at developers. He was surprised that while it sold well, no other game used it.Hague, see \\"Was it your idea to sell the source code?\\" He also released a scenario editor, but only one pre-packaged set of user-created scenarios is known. In 2013 Crawford publicly released the source code of several of his games, including Eastern Front. References =Notes= =Bibliography= * Chris Crawford, \\"Chapter 18.

Many people have since believed that this is true, but Bob is just a name chosen by the Belgian government.Verkeersveiligheid Nederland  History  The Bob campaign originated in Belgium, in 1995, in a collaboration between several governmental departments, the police and the Belgian beer brewing industry. The campaign appeared to be successful right from the start. In just a few weeks time, 4 out of 5 Belgians had heard about Bob. Now, 97% of the Belgian population knows about the campaign, with Bob becoming the symbol against drinking and driving. To date, more than 37% of all drivers in Belgium claim to have offered to be a designated driver. 34% have actually been a designated driver and 46% have been driven home safely by their 'Bob'.

It broadcasts at 94.5 MHz with an effective radiated power of 90,000 Watts from a transmitter on Mount Seymour in the District of North Vancouver. Owned by Bell Media, with studios located at Robson and Burrard Street in Downtown Vancouver, the station broadcasts a Top 40/CHR format branded as 94.5 Virgin Radio. The station's main competitors are CKKS-FM and CKZZ-FM. History The 94.5 FM frequency was originally assigned by a low-power temporary FM radio station to provide information on traffic conditions between Vancouver and Coquitlam, which received approval in 1998.Decision CRTC 98-228 The CRTC began the application process for a new Vancouver FM station in the fall of 2000. There were eleven prospective applicants, reflecting the fact that the 94.5 MHz frequency was the last remaining high-power FM slot in the Vancouver market. On June 5, 2001, Focus Communications was granted a licence to operate an Urban contemporary format.Decision CRTC 2001-312. The station's call letters, CFBT-FM, were assigned in November of the same year, and an official launch date was set for March 4, 2002 as the second urban station in Canada. Test transmissions began in mid-February 2002. The station adopted a \\"soft start\\" launch wherein announcers and programming were gradually introduced over a period of several weeks. By mid-2003, the station changed to more of a rhythmic top 40 format. In September 2004, CFBT changed its format to a top 40/CHR format, significantly decreasing the amount of hip hop and R&B; on the station's playlist. This change was prompted by the shift of CKZZ-FM to its current hot AC format on March 1, 2004. It became the only top 40 station in British Columbia until 2007. The station continued to lean rhythmic for about a year, before adopting a more mainstream direction. More rhythmic tracks were phased in by 2007, when CTVglobemedia acquired the station. On February 26, 2007, CHUM Limited (CHQM-FM, CFUN and CKST) announced that it would acquire the station from previous owner Focus Entertainment Group. The Canadian Radio- television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) approved the sale in October, and CTVglobemedia (CHUM's successor) assumed ownership on November 2, 2007. Until 2011, CFBT was the only CTVglobemedia radio station that had never been owned by CHUM Limited until it acquired CFXJ-FM in Toronto most recently. Since CTVglobemedia acquired the station, it is also the largest top 40 station in Canada not under local ownership. The station was sold to Bell Canada in 2011, like with most CTVglobemedia stations/channels, and the CHUM Radio Network subsidiary became Bell Media Radio. On April 25, 2012, Bell Media announced a new morning show, The Beat Mornings with Holly Conway, Jonny Staub, Nira Arora and Amy Beeman, to start on April 30. Former morning show host Kid Carson left the station and joined CKKS-FM in September after his non-compete contract expired. On February 20, 2015, Bell announced that CFBT would rebrand as 94.5 Virgin Radio on March 5, returning the brand to the market for the first time since March 2014, when CKZZ-FM rebranded back to its former Z95.3 moniker due to Bell's merger with CKZZ's then-owner Astral Media, with Bell retaining the rights to the \\"Virgin\\" branding in Canada.http://radioinsight.com/blog/headlines/92226/virgin-radio-returns-to- vancouver/http://radioinsight.com/blog/headlines/92080/chr-rebrandings-reach- vancouver/ On March 5, at 9 AM, the official rebranding took place.

He introduced in 2002 a line of bikes designed for everyday, practical use that integrated fenders, racks, and generator lights.

Life He was born in Antioch, Syria (modern Antakya, Turkey). In 102 BC, his reputation having been already established, especially as an improvisatore, he went to Rome, where he was well received amongst the highest and most influential families. His chief patron was Lucullus, whose gentile name he assumed. In 93 BC, he visited Sicily with his patron, on which occasion he received the citizenship of Lucanian Heraclea, one of the federate towns and, indirectly, by the provisions of the Lex Plautia Papiria, that of Rome. In 62 BC, he was accused by a certain Grattius of having assumed the citizenship illegally, but Cicero successfully defended him in his speech Pro Archia. That speech, which furnishes nearly all the information concerning Archias, states that he had celebrated the deeds of Gaius Marius and Lucullus in the Cimbrian and Mithridatic Wars and that he was engaged upon a poem of which the events of Cicero's consulship formed the subject. The Greek Anthology contains 35 epigrams under the name of Archias, but it is doubtful how many are his work. See also * Pro Archia Poeta References *Steven M.

In 1974, Herman Miller commissioned him to apply his research to office seating. Two years later, the Ergon chair was introduced. Biography Stumpf was born in St. Louis, Missouri. His father died when he was 13, and his mother, a gerontology nurse, relocated the family to Winona, Minnesota, to be near her family. He served in the U.S. Navy and then earned a bachelor's in industrial design from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and a master's in environmental design from the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. Stumpf's association with Herman Miller began in 1970 when he joined the staff of the Herman Miller Research Corporation. After establishing his own firm in 1972, Stumpf created the Ergon chair, the first ergonomic work chair. Later, in collaboration with Don Chadwick, he produced the groundbreaking Equa and iconic Aeron chairs. He also was principal designer for the Ethospace system. Stumpf's death at age 70 was attributed to complications from abdominal surgery. He was married to Sharon Stumpf, and has five grandchildren: Gabriella, Erin, Max, David and Julia.

It was first released in Japan on October 20, 2005, and was later released in Europe on February 10, 2006, and in North America three days later. It is a prequel to Feel the Magic: XY/XX. Plot The premise of the game is that the player's female love interest gets into perilous situations or is placed out of reach from the male protagonist. A minigame must be completed in order to rescue her, or sometimes, get the male protagonist out of trouble. All of these minigames require use of the stylus, and the DS to be held in a certain way, even upside-down. Some require use of the DS's built-in microphone. Gameplay Some examples of these minigames are: *The male protagonist runs up a downward moving escalator, and must avoid Sumo wrestlers along the way by moving left and right. There is a similar variation where he paddles up a river avoiding giant crocodiles. *The mysterious girl in lavender ties the protagonist to a chair and throws various food items at him. He must avoid eating the purple cakes, but can eat the other morsels like pizzas and white-iced cakes. *The female love interest performs yoga, while the male protagonist tries to keep a sweet-smelling rose within the range of her sense of smell. The player's performance is graded as an amount of 'Hearts', which are given at the end of a minigame depending on how well they did. There are a few multiplayer minigames which involve four differently coloured protagonists competing over the love interest, such as an elimination based game of catching an ever-growing beach ball which eventually explodes, and log rafting while trying to rescue the female from the water, while trying to steal her from other player's log rafts. Reception The game received \\"average\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of two eights, one seven, and one nine for a total of 32 out of 40. Detroit Free Press gave it a score of three stars out of four and stated, \\"The music here and the design all are distinctly Japanese, with crazy refrains like \\"Rub it!\\" being shouted all the time. Don't ask me to explain. Just pick up and enjoy.\\" However, The A.V. Club gave it a C+, saying that \\"True love takes more than moony-eyed flirting; Sega needs to get the mechanics right to make the magic happen.\\" The Sydney Morning Herald gave it two-and-a-half stars out of five, stating that the game is \\"inventive, creative and strangely compelling, but the more difficult tasks can be frustrating and its lasting appeal is limited.\\" The Times gave it one star out of five and called it \\"mind-bogglingly shallow\\".

The root word of the term is the Cebuano term for hand, kamot. Although in Cebu, it is culturally associated with the way women fight (pinching, scratching and gouging), the techniques used are effective against opponents of all sizes. Kinamotay involves extensive use of grappling and manipulation of nerve and pressure points, so as to allow the practitioner to inflict pain and control the opponent while applying the techniques. The biting aspect of kinamotay concerns itself with what targets to bite, how much to bite at a time, and the angle and movement of the bite. Favoured targets include sensitive and easily accessible areas such as the face, neck, ear, groin, nipple, and latissimus dorsi muscle. These targets are also chosen over others because of the difficulty countering a kinamotay practitioner biting them, and hence to ensure that an uninterrupted bite can take place. One key principle is uninterrupted biting, this means that you place yourself in such position that you can continue biting as long as you want, disabling your opponent from escaping your bites. It can be used to inflict pain and can be used to cut arteries which can cause severe bleeding.  References  * Zorbas, Vagelis. Kino Mutai: The Art of Biting and Eye Gouging. www.fullcombat.com.

OR 6 traverses the Wilson River Highway No. 37 of the Oregon state highway system, named after the river paralleling the highway's western segment. Route description The highway near Banks looking east towards Portland OR 6 begins (at its western terminus) at a junction with U.S. Route 101 and Oregon Route 131 in downtown Tillamook. From there it winds eastward though the Northern Oregon Coast Range along the Wilson River, and through a portion of the Tillamook State Forest. The stretch through the Coast Range is well known for its scenic beauty (as well as frequent accidents; the highway is a highly traveled route despite numerous twists and turns and steep grades). Emerging from the Coast Range, it passes through a few foothill communities. At the base of the Coast Range, Oregon Route 8 forks off to the east, heading towards the communities of Gales Creek and Forest Grove; whereas OR 6 continues to the northeast. OR 6 soon passes south of the city of Banks, where it has an interchange with the Nehalem Highway (OR 47), and Wilkesboro. A few miles east of Banks, OR 6 ends at an interchange with U.S. Route 26, the Sunset Highway. Travelers generally continue east on US 26 (which is a freeway east of the interchange) into Portland. OR 6 passes through some of the areas devastated during the Tillamook Burn, a series of fires that occurred in the 1930s, 1940s, and early 1950s in eastern Tillamook County. History During the Great Depression workers from the Works Progress Administration assisted in the construction of the road. Before 1957, OR 6 included the entirety of today's Oregon Route 8, plus an additional stretch into downtown Portland. With the completion of the Sunset Highway (and the new alignment through Banks), the route through Gales Creek and the Tualatin Valley was renumbered as OR 8; and OR 6 was placed on the alignment it has today. The section from Glenwood east to the US 26 junction was a former and temporary routing of US 26, continuing north through Timber. This routing was used by US 26 while the final stretch was completed. Major intersections Start of Oregon Route 6 at Tillamook.

In 1858 he led a Baptist Mission that relocated from the then Spanish island of Fernando Po and landed in Southern Cameroons. According to the record, he bought land from indigenous Bimbia chiefs, established a seaside settlement christened Victoria after the reigning British Empress. The settlement was renamed Limbe by decree in 1982 by President Ahmadou Ahidjo of Cameroun. Alfred Saker wished to be known under no other designation than a \\"Missionary to Africa\\". He was a leader of the early British Baptist missionaries that established churches on Fernando Po Island and Cameroon. His 1844-1876 mission work included translation \\\\- between 1862 and 1872 - of the Bible into the Duala language.  Biography  =Early life and consecration (1841 - 1842)= Birthplace ‚Äî Childhood ‚Äî Youth Alfred Saker was born on 21 July 1814 in Borough Green, in Wrotham, Kent. William H. Brackney, Historical Dictionary of the Baptists, Scarecrow Press, USA, 2009, p. 501 His father was a millwright and engineer, and the parent of a large family of children, many of whom died in infancy. Alfred was a weakly babe. His parents could afford only to send him to the National School of the place. He early showed a great love for books. He later entered his father's workshop, carrying with him a thirst for knowledge, study and books. Before he was sixteen, he had constructed a small steam-engine. Conversion ‚Äî Devotion to Christ There was, indeed, a small Baptist chapel in the hamlet. Alfred Saker's mind was not on the Gospel. One Sabbath evening he was strolling alone through the street, when the singing in a chapel that he passed drew his attention. He entered. He assisted in the choir, and as his gifts drew attention, he was prompt to exercise them in the cottages and hamlets around. He took an active part in every good work. On 4 January 1834, at 19 years old, he was baptized by Mr. Fremling, of Foots cray, and became a member of the church in the village of his nativity. Edward Bean Underhill, Alfred Saker, Missionary to Africa: A Biography, Baptist Missionary Society, UK, 1884, p. 4 With the public devotion of himself to Christ, he began to extend his labours in every direction. His evenings were either given to self-improvement or he would go to some member's house, where a few lowly people were gathered for converse and prayer. His fitness for evangelistic service became more and more apparent. Not a village or hamlet in the neighbour¬¨hood was left untouched by his zealous ministrations. This, perhaps, may be regarded as the beginning of his ministry. It was a voluntary movement on his part. The church soon called him to exercise his ministry in a more formal way, and for some time, at their request, he occupied every other Sabbath the little chapel at Plaxtol. Dockyard at Devonport ‚Äî Marriage Mrs Saker, portrayed in her daughter's book The death of his father, in 1838, led Saker to seek employment elsewhere. He applied at various dockyards, and was appointed in Devonport, preparing drawings for the Admiralty. In October 1839, he was sent for nine months to the dockyard at Deptford, to superintend the erection of machinery. Edward Bean Underhill, Alfred Saker, Missionary to Africa: A Biography, Baptist Missionary Society, UK, 1884, p. 5 In February 1840, in St Marys, Newington, London, he was married to Helen Jessup Edward Bean Underhill, Alfred Saker, Missionary to Africa: A Biography, Baptist Missionary Society, UK, 1884, p. 5 and returned to Devonport. Desire for a missionary life In the early days of his Christian life, he had formed the desire to consecrate his powers to the service of Christ in Africa. He owed much to his highly esteemed pastor, the Rev. Thos. Horton. In this wish he was encouraged by his devoted wife. He was accepted by the Committee of the Baptist Missionary Society. Mr. and Mrs. Saker, then members of the Morice Square Baptist church, Devonport, offered themselves for the work. It was the purpose of the missionary executive to use a small steamer in connection with mission work and Mr. Saker went out in the position of assistant missionary, combining with that the duties of engineer. =Departure for Africa= Origin of the African Mission & The exploration The Act of Emancipation in Jamaica drove numbers of the freed Africans to Gospel the light of life to the land of their fathers, the Dark Continent. Other British candidates like Rev. Joseph. Merrick, Alfred Saker, with their families, were examined and accepted. He arrived in Douala with his wife in 1845. Edwin Ardenert, Shirley Ardener, Kingdom on Mount Cameroon: Studies in the History of the Cameroon Coast 1500-1970, Berghahn Books, USA, 1996, p. 145 = Jamaican Baptist Mission to Eq. Guinea and Cameroon = Joseph Wilson, The first convert in Fernando Po In Jamaica, there was an end to slavery. A number of ex-slaves who had become Christians decided to become missionaries in Africa. So began the Jamaican Baptist Missionary Society work in 1843, in Fernando Po, today Equatorial Guniea near the coast of Cameroon. In 1853, the Spanish government, instigated by the Jesuit missionaries, insisted on the departure of the Baptists from Fernando Po, and suppressed all Protestant worship. The converts resolved to accompany their teachers, and the whole Baptist community removed under Mr. Saker's guidance to Amboises Bay, on the mainland. He purchased a tract of land on the coast from the Bimbia chief, and mapped out the new colony of Victoria. Under his energetic superintendence and untiring personal labor the ground was soon covered with houses and gardens for the exiles. Mr. Saker's influence upon the native chiefs and their people was most successfully exercised in suppressing many of their cruel and sanguinary customs. Indeed, if he had chosen, he might have made himself their king in the later years of his residence among them. Although he lived so long in a climate deadly to Europeans, he suffered greatly from fever and debility. Shortly after his arrival at Fernando Po, the headquarters of the Baptist missionaries, he visited the tribes on the mainland at the mouth of the Cameroons River. Here he built a house suitable for the work, with his own hands, and gradually acquired acquaintance with the language of the people. Within two years of the commencement of his labors he had reduced their language to writing and prepared a lesson-book for the school which he had formed. With the printing- press and material sent to him by the church at Devonport he printed schoolbooks for the use of his scholars and portions of the New Testament. In 1849, the church at Cameroons was formed, and a Christian civilization began to spread itself there through Mr. Saker's efforts. He induced the people to labor with something like regularity in agriculture, introducing various plants, such as bread-fruit, mangoes, oranges, and other fruits and vegetables for daily sustenance. These productions, moreover, enabled them to obtain manufactured articles from the ships frequenting the river, and in the course of a few years a civilized community was established. He taught his converts the industrial arts, and soon found himself surrounded by artisans of all sorts, carpenters, smiths, bricklayers, etc. The more forward scholars soon became helpful in the printing-office work, and aided in the translation and printing of the Scriptures in the Duala tongue, which was his lifelong task. In 1851, the mission was reduced by death to such a degree that not a single fellow-laborer remained of those who went out with him, except one or two colored brethren. All his European colleagues were gone, and he was left alone. Hitherto he had been in a subordinate position, but now from necessity he was obliged to take the lead. In 1858, the Spanish authorities expelled the Protestant missionaries from Fernando Po and Alfred Saker returned to the mainland with a group of liberated slaves, and bought a large tract of land (16 km x 8 km) from King William of Bimbia. The small group built a school, a church, and other buildings for the mission, thereby founding the city of Victoria, now Limb√© (since 1982). They also faced problems of health or the hostility of the population. They opened churches, dispensaries and centers of care and trained a great number of Cameroonian pastors, tailors, shoe-makers, masons and carpenters who helped them build the Church of B√©thel in 1860. = Lifetime work : Bible translation in Duala = In 1847, the Jamaican Joseph Merrick had completed a translation of the Gospel of Matthew into the Isubu language. A year later Saker himself started a translation in Douala. Jaap Van Slageren, Les origines de l'√âglise √©vang√©lique du Cameroun: missions europ√©ennes et christianisme autochtone, Brill Archive, Netherlands, 1972 , p. 29 In 1872 he had the whole Bible translated in this language and 200 copies were printed at his own press. In the meantime, Saker established a European settlement named Victoria. The Protestant missionaries were forced to leave the Roman Catholic Spanish island of Fernando Po and could now join forces with Saker from this settlement. = Working with fellow missionaries = Joseph Merrick at an Isubu funeral, Limbe (1845). Alfred Saker, Missionary to Africa, who landed, founded and named the Township Victoria. Tablet erected in memory of his devoted work to mark the Centenary of Victoria, 1858-1958 One of the fascinating things in the work of Saker was working with people from Jamaica. Joseph Merrick can be seen as the pioneer of the work in Cameroon. He had a talent for learning languages and within a short time he preached in Isubu and Douala. He died on the way to Jamaica in the year 1849. = Tensions with missionaries and country peoples = The Conflicts with country peoples Another Jamaican was Rev. Joseph Jackson Fuller (1825-1908), born into slavery in Jamaica. In 1850 he was accepted as a missionary and eight years later he became pastor. Fuller wrote in the period in Fernando Po about tensions between the whites from England and the former slaves from Jamaica. The British showed themselves in a paternalistic attitude and a certain degree of cultural domination. Fuller realized a lot of work in education, oversaw the printing and negotiated with the local king. He also translated the book Pilgrims Progress in Douala. He left Cameroon in 1888 and until his death he lived in England. Although all the missionaries of the Baptist Missionary Society were in theory equal, there was nevertheless differences. For example, in the wages: in 1863 Saker received ¬£250 pound, Fuller ¬£125 and Rev. Johnson, the first baptized by Saker, 100 pounds. There were complaints about the actions of Saker from the local believers, but also a Scottish missionary protested his actions. After investigation the missionary organization said Saker was not guilty, however, the way he his treated the local believers had to change. The Scottish missionary was fired. This was of the opinion that the three performance Saker - Bible translation, printing and the foundation of Victoria - had been largely due to Merrick and Fuller. = Less contrast = By the end of the 1870s Saker stopped his work and returned to his homeland, where he died in 1880. The history of Alfred Saker shows a less black and white picture than seen on the memorial in Limbe. =Geographical discoveries= The Cameroons that Saker laboured The Baptist Church, Limb√© Family life He has been supported during his mission by his wife and kids.Alfred Saker: The Pioneer of the Cameroons (1908), Author: His daughter Emily M. Saker, , p.  Legacy  Alfred Saker monument Alfred Saker first went to Africa in 1844 as part of a missionary team on the island of Fernando Po (now Bioko). He was, in the opinion of David Livingstone, the most important English missionary in West Africa. He envisioned great possibilities and tried to convince the English government to make this area a Crown Colony. He established his first missionary station on the continent near present-day Douala, Cameroon, in 1845. He founded the city of Victoria, Cameroon, and translated the Bible into Douala, the local language.

Smaragdus was Exarch of Ravenna twice, from 585 to 589 and from 603 to 611. During his first tenure, Smaragdus made an alliance with the Franks and Avars against the perennial foes of the Exarchate, the Lombards, and appeared poised to extinguish the Lombard power before it had been fully established. However, the effort came to nothing, for the Franks were not as serious about fighting the Lombards as Smaragdus was.J. B. Bury, A History of the Later Roman Empire (London: Macmillan, 1889), vol. 2 pp. 147f One notable military achievement during his first reign was the recovery of Classis, the port of Ravenna, from the Lombards in 588. Smaragdus was also known for his violence toward the followers of the schismatic bishops during the schism of the Three Chapters. These included Severinus, Archbishop of Aquileia and his followers, then at Grado, whom he ordered to attend a synod at Ravenna.Paul the Deacon (3.26) states Smaragdus \\"personally dragged him [the Archbishop] out of the church\\". History of the Lombards, translated by William Dudley Foulke, 1907 (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania, 1974), p. 131 When the council failed to solve any major issues, he forced the archbishop to declare his loyalty to the Orthodox creed. His violence, combined with alleged charges of insanity, prompted his removal from office in 589. In 603 the Byzantine Emperor Phocas restored Smaragdus to his former position.Paul the Deacon 4.25 (History, p. 168) Smaragdus inherited a war with the Lombards from his predecessor Callinicus, and refused to give up the daughter of the Lombard king Agilulf, as well as her husband, both of whom had been taken prisoner by the Byzantines in 601. That same year, Agilulf besieged Cremona with the help of the Avars, capturing it on 21 August 605 and afterwards razing the city; next he captured Mantua on 1 September. When his army reached the fortress of Vulturina,Foulke reports Thomas Hodgkin located Vulturina \\"on the northern bank of the Po, not far from Panna, which is probably correct.\\" However, Foulke also records another opinion that \\"a castle named Vulturena at the upper end of Lake Como at the entrance of the Valtellina is intended.\\" (History, p. 171 n.3) the garrison surrendered, firing the town of Brescello as they fled. Smaragdus was forced to release his hostages in April 605 in order to gain peace.Paul the Deacon History, 4.28; translated by Foulke, p. 168 The peace with the Lombards held for the rest of his administration. Smaragdus erected a gilded statue of Phocas on the column of Phocas in the Roman Forum. After Phocas was deposed by Heraclius in 610, Smaragdus was replaced again, this time by John I.; Bury, Later Roman Empire, vol. 2 pp. 206  References  Category:6th-century exarchs of Ravenna Category:7th-century exarchs of Ravenna Category:6th-century births Category:7th-century deaths ","title":"Smaragdus"},{"id":"2439733","title":"Brad Winchester"},{"id":"2439744","text":"ESPN America was a British-based European sports network, focusing on professional and collegiate sports of the United States and Canada. Originally launched on 5 December 2002 as NASN (the North American Sports Network), ESPN America broadcast a selection of top North American professional and collegiate sports leagues including Major League Baseball (MLB), National Basketball Association (NBA), National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and Canadian Football League (CFL), 24 hours a day on digital cable and digital satellite television. Formerly operated by Setanta Sports with backing from Benchmark Capital Europe, it was acquired by the American sports media company ESPN in March 2007. It was subsequently re-branded as ESPN America on 1 February 2009 before closing on 1 August 2013. Programming Programming on ESPN America varied from country to country. The channel operated three feeds throughout Europe, the Middle East and North Africa. In the United Kingdom, Ireland, and the Nordic countries events shown on ESPN America included Major League Baseball, the College World Series, NCAA college football and college basketball, the NCAA Men's Ice Hockey Championship Frozen Four plus the Arena Football League, Major League Lacrosse, and the NCAA Men's Lacrosse Championship Final Four. In continental Europe, the Middle East, North Africa and Iceland the broadcast also included NFL programmes. ESPN America also showed the Little-League World Series from Williamsport, PA and the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest from Coney Island in Brooklyn, NY. NASN paid ¬£11.6m in March 2006 for the rights to show ten live MLB games a week. In 2006, ESPN programmes, including Baseball Tonight, Around the Horn, The Sports Reporters and Pardon the Interruption were dropped from the schedule as the contract between NASN and ESPN ended. However, they returned from 1 April 2007 after ESPN acquired the channel. ESPN America also aired other ESPN US produced single-sport programmes, such as College Football Live, College GameDay, NBA Fastbreak and NASCAR Now. In addition, to mark the 30th anniversary of ESPN, the channel has been showing ESPN Films' 30 for 30 series. On 28 October 2009, ESPN America began to be broadcast in 16:9 widescreen. On 1 March 2010, ESPN America began showing a European edition of SportsCenter, anchored by Michael Kim. The 30-minute programme broadcast five days a week at 6am UK/7am CET with three repeat showings following immediately after, with an updated show at 10.30pm UK/11.30pm CET. The show was filmed at ESPN‚Äôs headquarters in Bristol, Connecticut, USA. Up until the 2011‚Äì12 NHL season, ESPN America held the rights to live and delayed NHL matches as well as round-up programming such as NHL On The Fly, however these rights were not renewed for the UK, Ireland & the Nordic countries and are now held by different networks across Europe. However, they still hold the rights for other countries throughout continental Europe, such as Germany. ESPN America acquired the American Hockey League, a minor North American Hockey League broadcast rights as a replacement for the UK, Ireland and the Nordic countries. In April 2012, SportsCenter moved from five to seven days a week with a new start time of 8am UK/9am CET. At this point, ESPN stopped producing a local version of SportsCenter, opting instead to broadcast an edited version of the 2am ET show from Los Angeles, cut to fit 45 minutes through removing commercial breaks and stories on European sports such as soccer. This show is then repeated at 8.45am, 4pm & 4.45pm (UK time). Sale to ESPN Former NASN logo used up to 1 February 2009. In late 2006, former owners Benchmark Capital Europe and Setanta Sports agreed to sell the network to ESPN for ‚Ç¨70m. The sale was completed in March 2007 but the network continued to be part of the Setanta Sports Pack on satellite television until June 2009 when Setanta UK went into administration. The network became known as ESPN America on 1 February 2009 to coincide with Super Bowl XLIII. The channel continued to provide the same lineup of North American sports programming. =ESPN America HD= ESPN America HD logo On 1 March 2010, the Nordic Canal Digital launched an HD version of ESPN America.

It is listed as number 6 in the MuktikƒÅ canon of 108 Upanishads. It is in prose, consisting of twelve terse verses, and is associated with a Rig Vedic school of scholars. It discusses the syllable Aum, presents the theory of four states of consciousness, and asserts that Aum is Brahman, which is the Whole, and that Brahman is this self (ƒÅtman).Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 2, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 605-637 The Mandukya Upanishad is notable for having been recommended in the MuktikƒÅ Upanishad, through two central characters of the Ramayana, as the one Upanishad that alone is sufficient for knowledge to gain moksha, and as first in its list of eleven principal Upanishads.Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 2, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 556-557 The text is also notable for inspiring Gaudapada's Karika, a classic for the Vedanta school of Hinduism. Mandukya Upanishad is among the oft cited texts on chronology and philosophical relationship between Hinduism and Buddhism. Etymology The root of Mandukya is sometimes considered as Manduka (Sanskrit: ‡§Æ‡§£‡•ç‡§°‡•Ç‡§ï) which literally has several meanings. It means \\"frog\\", \\"a particular breed of horse\\", \\"the sole of horse's hoof\\", or \\"Spiritual distress\\" maNDUka Monier-Williams' Sanskrit- English Dictionary, Cologne Digital Lexicon, Germany Some writers have suggested the \\"frog\\" as the etymological root for Mandukya Upanishad. 'Mun' means mind or heart and 'duka' means difficulties causing distress. Lack of proper understanding of concepts about God can cause distress. Another root for the Upanishad's name is MƒÅnduka (Sanskrit: ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§£‡•ç‡§°‡•Ç‡§ï) which literally is \\"a Vedic school\\" or means \\"a teacher\\".mANDUka Monier-Williams' Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Cologne Digital Lexicon, Germany Paul Deussen states the etymological roots of Mandukya Upanishad to be a \\"half lost school of Rigveda\\".Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 2, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 605-609 This school may be related to the scholar named Hrasva MƒÅ·πá·∏ç≈´keya, whose theory of semivowels is discussed in Aitareya Aranyaka of Rigveda.Charles W. Kreidler, Phonology: Critical Concepts, Volume 1, Routledge, , page 9 Applying the rules of sandhi, the text is also called Mandukyopanishad. Chronology and authorship =Chronology= The chronology of Mandukya Upanishad, like other Upanishads, is uncertain and contested.Stephen Phillips (2009), Yoga, Karma, and Rebirth: A Brief History and Philosophy, Columbia University Press, , Chapter 1 The chronology is difficult to resolve because all opinions rest on scanty evidence, an analysis of archaism, style and repetitions across texts, driven by assumptions about likely evolution of ideas, and on presumptions about which philosophy might have influenced which other Indian philosophies.Patrick Olivelle (1996), The Early Upanishads: Annotated Text & Translation, Oxford University Press, , Introduction Chapter Nakamura dates the Mandukya Upanishad to \\"about the first or second centuries A.D.\\" Richard King too dates the Mandukya Upanishad at the first two centuries of the Common Era. Olivelle states, \\"we have the two late prose Upanisads, the Prasna and the Mandukya, which cannot be much older than the beginning of the common era\\". Mahony, on the other hand, states that Mandukya Upanishad probably emerged in the late fifth and early fourth centuries BCE, along with Prashna and Maitri Upanishads.WK Mahony (1987), Upanishads, in Jones, Lindsay, MacMillan Encyclopedia of Religion (2005), MacMillan, , page 9483 Phillips lists Mandukya Upanishad before and about the time the Shvetashvatara Upanishad, the Maitri Upanishad, as well as the first Buddhist Pali and Jaina canonical texts were composed. RanadeRD Ranade, A Constructive Survey of Upanishadic Philosophy, Chapter 1, pages 13-18 posits a view similar to Phillips, placing Mandukya's chronological composition in the fifth, that is the last group of ancient Principal Upanishads. =Chronological roots= The foundation of several theories in the Mandukya Upanishad are found in chronologically more ancient Sanskrit texts.PT Raju (1985), Structural Depths of Indian Thought, State University New York Press, , pages 32-33; Quote: \\"We can see that this story [in Chandogya Upanishad] is an anticipation of the Mandukya doctrine, (...)\\" For example, chapters 8.7 through 8.12 of Chandogya Upanishad discuss the \\"four states of consciousness\\" as awake, dream-filled sleep, deep sleep, and beyond deep sleep.Robert Hume, Chandogya Upanishad - Eighth Prathapaka, Seventh through Twelfth Khanda, Oxford University Press, pages 268-273 =Authorship= The text of the Mandukya Upanishad is fully incorporated in the Mandukya Karika, a commentary attributed to the 6th century CEPT Raju (2009), The Philosophical Traditions of India, Routledge, , page 177 Gaudapada, and is not known to exist independent of this commentary. Isaeva states that some scholars, including Paul Deussen, presumed that Gaudapada may be its author; however, there is no historical or textual evidence for this hypothesis. Scholars consider Mandukya Upanishad as a Principal Upanishad with more ancient origins. Structure In contrast to the older Upanishads, the Mandukya Upanishad is very short, with clear and concise formulations. It has twelve terse prose paragraphs. Contents The Mandukya Upanishad is an important Upanishad in Hinduism, particularly to its Advaita Vedanta school.K Singh (2001), Some Thoughts on Vedanta, India International Centre Quarterly, Vol. 28, No. 3, pages 100-108 It tersely presents several central doctrines, namely that \\"the universe is Brahman,\\" \\"the self (soul, atman) exists and is Brahman,\\" and \\"the four states of consciousness\\".R. V. De Smet (1972), Early Trends in the Indian Understanding of Man, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 22, No. 3 (Jul., 1972), pages 259-268Mark B. Woodhouse (1978), Consciousness and Brahman-Atman, The Monist, Vol. 61, No. 1, Conceptions of the Self: East & West (JANUARY, 1978), pages 109-124 The Mandukya Upanishad also presents several theories about the syllable Om, and that it symbolizes self. =Aum in the Mandukya Upanishad= The Mandukya Upanishad is one of several Upanishads that discuss the meaning and significance of the syllable Om (Aum). The Mandukya Upanishad opens by declaring, \\"Om!, this syllable is this whole world\\". Thereafter it presents various explanations and theories on what it means and signifies. This discussion is built on a structure of \\"four fourths\\" or \\"fourfold\\", derived from A + U + M + \\"silence\\" (or without an elementVerse 12 of Mandukya Upanishad; see Robert Hume's The Thirteen Principal Upanishad, page 393). Aum as all states of time In verse 1, the Upanishad states that time is threefold: the past, the present and the future, that these three are \\"Aum\\". The four fourth of time is that which transcends time, that too is \\"Aum\\" expressed. Aum as all states of Atman In verse 2, states the Upanishad, \\"this brahman is the Whole. Brahman is this self (ƒÅtman); that [brahman] is this self (ƒÅtman), consisting of four corners.\\" Aum as all states of consciousness In verses 3 to 6, the Mandukya Upanishad enumerates four states of consciousness: wakeful, dream, deep sleep and the state of ekatma (being one with Self, the oneness of Self). These four are A + U + M + \\"without an element\\" respectively. Aum as all of etymological knowledge In verses 9 to 12, the Mandukya Upanishad enumerates fourfold etymological roots of the syllable \\"Aum\\". It states that the first element of \\"Aum\\" is A, which is from Apti (obtaining, reaching) or from Adimatva (being first). The second element is U, which is from Utkarsa (exaltation) or from Ubhayatva (intermediateness). The third element is M, from Miti (erecting, constructing) or from Mi Minati, or apƒ´ti (annihilation). The fourth is without an element, without development, beyond the expanse of universe. In this way, states the Upanishad, the syllable Om is the Atman (the self) indeed. =Four states of consciousness= The Mandukya Upanishad describes four states of consciousness, namely waking (j√•grat), dreaming (svapna), and deep sleep (su·π£upti),Arvind Sharma, Sleep as a State of Consciousness in Advaita Ved√•nta. State University of New York Pressadvaita.org.uk, Om' ‚Äì three states and one reality (An interpretation of the Mandukya Upanishad) which correspond to the Three Bodies Doctrine: # The first state is the waking state, in which we are aware of our daily world. \\"It is described as outward-knowing (bahish-prajnya), gross (sthula) and universal (vaishvanara)\\". This is the gross body. # The second state is the dreaming mind. \\"It is described as inward-knowing (antah-prajnya), subtle (pravivikta) and burning (taijasa)\\". This is the subtle body. # The third state is the state of deep sleep. In this state the underlying ground of concsiousness is undistracted, \\"the Lord of all (sarv'-eshvara), the knower of all (sarva- jnya), the inner controller (antar-yami), the source of all (yonih sarvasya), the origin and dissolution of created things (prabhav'-apyayau hi bhutanam)\\". This is the causal body. # The fourth factor is Turiya, pure consciousness. It is the background that underlies and transcends the three common states of consciousness. In this consciousness both absolute and relative, saguna brahman and Nirguna Brahman, are transcended. It is the true state of experience of the infinite (ananta) and non-different (advaita/abheda), free from the dualistic experience which results from the attempts to conceptualise ( vipalka) reality. It is the state in which ajativada, non-origination, is apprehended. =Theory and nature of Atman= The verses 3 through 7 discuss four states of Atman (Self, Soul). Verse 3 of the Upanishad describes the first state of Self as outwardly cognitive with seven limbs,Sankara's Bhasya refers to Chandogya Upanishad's verse 5.18.2 for the list of seven nineteen mouths,Sankara's Bhasya states that these nineteen mouths of a human being are what interact with the empirical universe: five senses - seeing, hearing, touch, taste and smell; five organs of action - speech, hand, locomotion, sexual activity and excretion; five vital types of breath; the manas (mind), the buddhi (intellect, power to reason), the ahamkara (ego) and the citta (consciousness). enjoying the gross,this is everything in the perceived empirical universe a state of Self common in all of human beings. The Mandukya Upanishad, in verse 4, asserts the second state of Self as inwardly cognitive with seven limbs, nineteen mouths, enjoying the exquisite, a state of brilliant Self. The Upanishad's verse 5 states the third state of Self as one without desire or anticipations, where pure conscience is his only mouth, where he is in unified cognition, enjoying the delight, a state of blissful Self. The verses 6 and 7 of the Upanishad states the fourth state of Self as one beyond all the three, beyond extrospective state, beyond introspective state, beyond cognitive state, the state of ekatmya pratyaya sara (one with the Self), tranquil, benign, advaita (without second). He then is the Self, just Atman, the one which should be discerned. Johnston summarizes these four states of Self, respectively, as seeking the physical, seeking inner thought, seeking the causes and spiritual consciousness, and the fourth state is realizing oneness with the Self, the Eternal. Similarities and differences with Buddhist teachings Scholars contest whether Mandukya Upanishad was influenced by Buddhist theories along with the similarities and differences between Buddhism and Hinduism in light of the text. According to Hajime Nakamura, the Mandukya Upanishad was influenced by Mahayana Buddhism and its concept of ≈õ≈´nyatƒÅ. Nakamura states, \\"many particular Buddhist terms or uniquely Buddhist modes of expression may be found in it\\", such as adrsta, avyavaharya, agrahya, alaksana, acintya, prapancopasama. According to Randall Collins the Mandukya Upanishad \\"includes phrases found in the Prajnaparamitrasutras of Mahayana Buddhism.\\" According to Michael Comans, Vidushekhara also notes that the term prapa√±copa≈õama does not appear in pre- Buddhist Brahmanic works, but in contrast to Nakamura he does not conclude that the term was taken over from Mahayana Buddhism. According to Comans, eventual Mahayana origins of this term are no more than a possibility, and not a certainty. Comans also disagrees with Nakamura's thesis that \\"the fourth realm (caturtha) was perhaps influenced by the Sunyata of Mahayana Buddhism.\\" According to Comans, Comans further refers to Nakamura himself, who notes that later Mahayana sutras such as the La·πÖkƒÅvatƒÅra S≈´tra and the concept of Buddha- nature, were influenced by Vedantic thought. Comans concludes that Jacobs lists adrsta and other terms in more ancient, pre-Buddhist literature such as the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad.GA Jacobs, A Concordance of the Principal Upanishads and Bhagavad Gita, Upanishad Vakya Kosha, Motilal Banarsidass, see pages 31-32 for adrsta, page 128 for avyavaharya, pages 13-14 for agrahya, etc. Isaeva states that there are differences in the teachings in the texts of Buddhism and the Mandukya Upanishad of Hinduism, because the latter asserts that citta \\"consciousness\\" is identical with the eternal and immutable atman \\"soul, self\\" of the Upanishads. In other words, Mandukya Upanishad and Gaudapada affirm the soul exists, while Buddhist schools affirm that there is no soul or self.KN Jayatilleke (2010), Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge, , pages 246-249, from note 385 onwards; Steven Collins (1994), Religion and Practical Reason (Editors: Frank Reynolds, David Tracy), State Univ of New York Press, , page 64; Quote: \\"Central to Buddhist soteriology is the doctrine of not-self (Pali: anattƒÅ, Sanskrit: anƒÅtman, the opposed doctrine of ƒÅtman is central to Brahmanical thought). Put very briefly, this is the [Buddhist] doctrine that human beings have no soul, no self, no unchanging essence.\\"; Edward Roer (Translator), , pages 2-4 Katie Javanaud (2013), Is The Buddhist 'No-Self' Doctrine Compatible With Pursuing Nirvana?, Philosophy NowJohn C. Plott et al (2000), Global History of Philosophy: The Axial Age, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, , page 63, Quote: \\"The Buddhist schools reject any ƒÄtman concept. As we have already observed, this is the basic and ineradicable distinction between Hinduism and Buddhism\\". Reception =Muktika Upanishad= Rama and Hanuman of the Hindu Epic Ramayana, in Muktika Upanishad, discuss moksha (freedom, liberation, deliverance). Rama, therein, recommends Mandukya as first among 108 Upanishads, as follows, =Classical commentators= Gaudapada One of the first known extant metrical commentary on this Upanishad was written by Gaudapada, This commentary, called the MƒÅnd≈´kya-kƒÅrikƒÅ, is the earliest known systematic exposition of Advaita Vedanta. Raju states that Gaudapada took over the Buddhist doctrines that ultimate reality is pure consciousness (vij√±apti- mƒÅtra), and \\"the four-cornered negation\\" (‡§ö‡§§‡•Å‡§∑‡•ç‡§ï‡•ã‡§ü‡§ø ‡§µ‡§ø‡§®‡§ø‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ‡•Å‡§ï‡•ç‡§§‡§É). Raju further states that Gaudapada \\"weaved [both doctrines] into a philosophy of the Mandukaya Upanisad, which was further developed by Shankara\\". Other scholars such as Murti state, that while there is shared terminology, the doctrines of Gaudapada and Buddhism are fundamentally different. Adi Shankara Adi Shankara, a disciple of Govinda Bhagavatpada who himself was either a direct or a distant disciple of Gaudapada, further made commentaries on Gaudapada Mandukya karika, Mandukya Upanishad forms one of the basis of Advaita Vedanta as expounded by Adi Shankara. Madhvacharya Madhvacharya, the propounder of Dvaita Vedanta, has written commentaries on Mandukya Upanishad and offers an emotional and thestic perspective of the scripture, and attributes them to ≈öruti, his commentary based on bhakti yoga and uses Vishnu and his attributes as a similes for deciphering the shlokas of the Mandukya Upanishad =Modern commentators= According to Aurobindo, Brahman, which has the potentiality of becoming, has created out an existence which has a relation between itself. This existence with its experience of becoming and having relation with the absolute is called as Soul or purusha, the principle or power of becoming is called as nature or prakriti. Swami Rama has provided an interpretation of this Upanishad from the experiential standpoint in his commentary Enlightenment without God.Swami Rama (9182), Enlightenment without God. Himalayan International Institute of Yoga Science and Philosophy of the USA Ranade calls the aphoristic style of Mandukya Upanishad as highly influential on the Sutras of Indian philosophies that followed it, and that the Upanishad has served as a foundational text of the major Vedanta school of Hinduism. He states,RD Ranade, A Constructive Survey of Upanishadic Philosophy, Chapter 1, pages 35-36 Ranade's views on the importance of Mandukya Upanishad and Gaudapada's commentary on Vedanta school, particularly Advaita Vedanta sub-school of Hinduism, is shared by modern era scholars such as Hacker, Vetter and others.W Halbfass (1991), Tradition and Reflection - Explorations in Indian Thought, State University of New York, , pages 139-141, 169-182 Johnston states that Mandukya Upanishad must be read in two layers, consciousness and vehicles of consciousness, soul and nature of soul, the empirical and the eternal.Charles Johnston, The Measures of the Eternal - Mandukya Upanishad Theosophical Quarterly, October, 1923, pages 158-162 The text aphoristically condenses these layers of message, both in literal and metaphorical sense. William Butler Yeats, the Irish poet, was inspired by the Upanishads and Mandukya Upanishad was among the texts he commented on.Enoch Brater (1975), W. B. Yeats: The Poet as Critic, Journal of Modern Literature, Vol. 4, No. 3, Special Yeats Number, pages 651-676Bruce Wilson (1982), \\"From Mirror after Mirror: Yeats and Eastern Thought,\\" Comparative Literature, Vol. 34, No. 1, pages 28-46 David Stoll's 1987 Piano Quartet is inspired by three Upanishads, one being Mandukya Upanishad, other two being Katha and Isha Upanishads.Guy Rickards (2002), David Stoll Record Reviews, Tempo New Series, Cambridge University Press, No. 222, page 53 column 1 See also * Adi Shri Gau·∏çapƒÅdƒÅchƒÅrya * Adi Shri Shankaracharya * Advaita * Shri Gaudapadacharya Mutt * Shri Govinda Bhagavatpadacharya Notes References Sources =Published sources=     * * =Web-sources= Further reading * *Eight Upanishads.

There were three hurricanes, none of which strengthened into major hurricanes, which are Category 3 or higher on the modern-day Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale. The first system was initially observed south of Cape Verde on August 31, an unusually late date. The storm was the strongest of the season, peaking as a Category 2 hurricane with winds of 100 mph (155 km/h). While located well north of the Azores, rough seas by the storm sunk a ship, killing all 45 crewmen. A second storm was first spotted in the Straits of Florida on September 10\\\\. It strengthened into a hurricane and tracked northwestward across the Gulf of Mexico, striking Louisiana shortly before dissipating on September 13\\\\. This storm caused 29 deaths and $150,000 (1897 USD) in damage. The third storm developed in the southeastern Gulf of Mexico on September 20\\\\. It tracked along the East Coast of the United States, causing widespread damage, particularly in Florida. A fourth storm was first observed in the northwestern Caribbean Sea on September 25\\\\. This storm moved in a semicircular path around Cuba and was last noted offshore Florida four days later. Minor wind and flood damage was reported in Cuba. On October 9, the fifth hurricane of the season was located near the Windward Islands. Moving westward, the storm eventually curved northeastward while crossing the Caribbean Sea, causing it to strike Cuba. Minor damage was reported on the island, though a ship sank with 230 people aboard; 42 of them were rescued, while the remaining 188 were presumed dead. The final observed system developed in the vicinity of the Bahamas on October 23\\\\. It later struck the Outer Banks of North Carolina; the storm caused severe flooding in southeastern Virginia, with six deaths reported. It was last noted on October 29\\\\. __TOC__ Timeline ImageSize = width:800 height:200 PlotArea = top:10 bottom:80 right:20 left:20 Legend = columns:3 left:30 top:58 columnwidth:270 AlignBars = early DateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy Period = from:01/08/1897 till:01/12/1897 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal ScaleMinor = grid:black unit:month increment:1 start:01/08/1897 Colors = id:canvas value:gray(0.88) id:GP value:red id:TD value:rgb(0.38,0.73,1) legend:Tropical_Depression_=_‚â§39_mph_(‚â§62_km/h) id:TS value:rgb(0,0.98,0.96) legend:Tropical_Storm_=_39‚Äì73_mph_(63‚Äì117_km/h) id:C1 value:rgb(1,1,0.80) legend:Category_1_=_74‚Äì95_mph_(118‚Äì153_km/h) id:C2 value:rgb(1,0.91,0.46) legend:Category_2_=_96‚Äì110_mph_(154‚Äì177_km/h) id:C3 value:rgb(1,0.76,0.25) legend:Category_3_=_111‚Äì129_mph_(178‚Äì208_km/h) id:C4 value:rgb(1,0.56,0.13) legend:Category_4_=_130‚Äì156_mph_(209‚Äì251_km/h) id:C5 value:rgb(1,0.38,0.38) legend:Category_5_=_‚â•157_mph_(‚â•252_km/h) Backgroundcolors = canvas:canvas BarData = barset:Hurricane bar:Month PlotData= barset:Hurricane width:10 align:left fontsize:S shift:(4,-4) anchor:till from:31/08/1897 till:09/09/1897 color:C2 text:\\"One\\" (C2) from:10/09/1897 till:13/09/1897 color:C1 text:\\"Two\\" (C1) from:20/09/1897 till:25/09/1897 color:TS text:\\"Three\\" (TS) from:25/09/1897 till:29/09/1897 color:TS text:\\"Four\\" (TS) from:09/10/1897 till:21/10/1897 color:C1 text:\\"Five\\" (C1) from:23/10/1897 till:29/10/1897 color:TS text:\\"Six\\" (TS) bar:Month width:15 align:center fontsize:S shift:(0,-20) anchor:middle color:canvas from:01/08/1897 till:01/09/1897 text:August from:01/09/1897 till:01/10/1897 text:September from:01/10/1897 till:01/11/1897 text:October from:01/11/1897 till:01/12/1897 text:November TextData = pos:(570,30) text:\\"(From the\\" pos:(617,30) text:\\"Saffir‚ÄìSimpson Hurricane Scale)\\" Systems =Hurricane One= The first hurricane of the season was observed near Cape Verde, beginning at 0600 UTC on August 31\\\\. Initially a tropical storm, it slowly strengthened while heading west- northwestward, reaching hurricane status on September 1\\\\. Curving northwestward, the storm intensified further into a Category 2 hurricane on September 3\\\\. It continued heading northwestward until curving to the northeast late on September 6\\\\. Around 1130 UTC on the following day, the storm attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 100 mph (155 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of . Early on September 9, the system weakened to a Category 1, before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone well north of the Azores later that day. The extratropical remnants continued weaken, before dissipating west of Ireland on September 10\\\\. The crew of the barkentine St. Peter reported that another ship capsized with 45 men aboard; all of them drowned. =Hurricane Two= A second hurricane was spotted in the Straits of Florida at tropical storm intensity on September 10\\\\. Several hours later, the system made landfall in Marquesas Keys, Florida. Early on September 11, it strengthened into a hurricane. Intensifying slightly further, the storm peaked with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph (140 km/h) shortly thereafter. The hurricane maintained this intensity while moving west-northwestward across the Gulf of Mexico and struck extreme southwestern Cameron Parish, Louisiana early on September 13\\\\. Shortly thereafter, it weakened to a tropical storm over Texas, before dissipating several hours later. No impact was reported in the Florida Keys. Strong winds in southwestern Louisiana damaged crops and toppled windmills. Offshore, boats and schooners suffered severe damage from wind-driven waves. Severe damage occurred in eastern Texas, with strong winds and storm surge damaging or destroying numerous buildings, houses, and crops in several cities, including Beaumont, New Sabine Pass, Orange, Sabine Pass, and Port Arthur. The storm was considered the worst in Orange since 1875. Overall, the storm caused at least 29 fatalities in Texas, with six died at Port Arthur, three offshore, four in Sabine Pass, and sixteen others at Beaumont. Damage in the state reached approximately $150,000. =Tropical Storm Three= The third storm of the season was first observed in the southeastern Gulf of Mexico on September 20\\\\. Strengthening while heading northeastward, the system made landfall near Boca Grande, Florida with winds of 70 mph (110 km/h) early on the following day. Heavy rainfall in Tampa caused the streets and sideways to become inundated, leaving portions of the city impassable, especially areas adjacent to the DeSoto Hotel. Two fire stations were severely damaged. On the east coast of Florida, the worst impact occurred in Cocoa, where some buildings were destroyed and others were deroofed. Further north in Fernandina Beach, ships in the harbor broke loose and tossed about, leaving considerable damage. Although the storm weakened while crossing Florida, it later re-strengthened after emerging into the Atlantic Ocean later on September 21\\\\. The system moved northeastward and made landfall near Hatteras, North Carolina at 1000 UTC on September 23, with winds of 70 mph (110 km/h). In eastern North Carolina, strong winds and high tides were observed in New Bern. Shortly thereafter, it re-emerged into the Atlantic Ocean. The system began weakening, while making two landfalls on September 24, the first on Long Island, New York, and the second near New London, Connecticut. Thereafter, the storm accelerated to the northeast and weakened to a tropical depression over New Brunswick early on September 25\\\\. Several hours later, the system dissipated offshore southeastern Labrador. =Tropical Storm Four= Early on September 25, a tropical storm was spotted about west of Grand Cayman. It moved slowly northwestward and passed near Cape San Antonio, Cuba early on September 27\\\\. The storm then entered the Gulf of Mexico and began strengthening while curving northward. On September 28, the system attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 45 mph (75 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of . Early on September 29, the storm curved eastward and dissipated several hours later offshore Florida. In Cuba, the storm brought strong winds and heavy rainfall as far east as Havana, causing flooding, \\"but no great damage\\". =Hurricane Five= The fifth tropical cyclone of the season was first observed near the Windward Islands on October 9\\\\. It moved west-northwestward across the Caribbean Sea and remained at that intensity for several days. The storm curved in a northwesterly direction by October 14 while located over the northwestern Caribbean Sea, and then northeastward on the following day. Eventually, it began to strengthen and reached hurricane intensity early on October 18\\\\. Several hours later, the hurricane made landfall in modern-day Sancti Sp√≠ritus Province, Cuba with winds of 80 mph (130 km/h). Minimal damage was reported in Cuba. However, the ship Triton sank offshore Pinar del R√≠o Province with 230 men aboard. Forty- two people were rescued by passing ships, while the remaining 188 died, including the captain, who committed suicide. The system weakened while crossing Cuba and fell to tropical storm intensity early on October 19\\\\. Around that time, the storm emerged into the Atlantic Ocean near the central Bahamas. Crossing through the islands, the system curved north-northeastward and began to accelerate. It did not re-strengthen and made landfall near Cape Hatteras, North Carolina with winds of 65 mph (100 km/h). Strong winds and rainfall totals ranging from were observed along the coast of North Carolina. Strong winds were reported in portions of the Northeastern United States, with highest wind speed being , observed in Block Island, Rhode Island. Reemerging into the Atlantic Ocean, this system continued rapidly northeastward, before becoming extratropical offshore New England on October 21\\\\. =Tropical Storm Six= The final tropical cyclone was located over the Bahamas on October 23\\\\. It moved north-northeastward and remained at the same intensity. By October 25, the storm began executing a cyclonic loop while offshore the East Coast of the United States. Around that time, the system attained its peak intensity with winds of 65 mph (100 km/h). Moving southwestward, the storm made landfall near Duck, North Carolina at 2300 UTC on October 25, at the same intensity. Early on October 26, the system curved southeastward and quickly moved offshore. It then moved eastward and later to the northeast, before becoming extratropical on October 29\\\\. Along much of the East Coast of the United States, the Weather Bureau warned about gales and rough seas. From Cape Hatteras, North Carolina to Maine, storm surge and tides resulted in considerable damage to boardwalks and beach cottages. In Virginia, storm surge caused a number of small crafts and a few ships to be washed ashore or destroyed. The James River rose to above high tide. A few cities experienced coastal flooding, including Chincoteague and Norfolk. The Willoughby Spit was split by the tides, washing away the Old Point Comfort railroad tracks. Cedar Island was \\"leveled to a mere flat breath of sand\\". Six fatalities were reported in Virginia, four of them from drowning in Newport News, while the other two were caused by electrocution.

He was the Republican leader of the United States House of Representatives from the second district of Indiana. Early life and education Halleck was born near DeMotte, in Jasper County, Indiana, the son of Abraham and Lura (n√©e Luce) Halleck. He served in the infantry of the United States Army in World War I. After military service, Halleck attended Indiana University at Bloomington. In 1924, Halleck was admitted to the bar and began practicing in Rensselaer, Indiana. From 1924 to 1934, he was the prosecuting attorney for the 13th district court. Career In 1935, Halleck was elected to fill the House vacancy created by the death of Congressman- elect Frederick Landis, and remained in that position until 1969. A prominent member of the conservative coalition, he served as the House Majority Leader after the elections of 1946 and 1952. He was House Minority Leader from 1959 to 1964. Halleck noted that a highlight of his career came at the 1940 Republican National Convention, when he nominated another person from Indiana, Wendell Willkie. Noting the mixed reception he got, Halleck said, \\"I got more brickbats and more bouquets over that speech than any other I've ever made.\\" In 1944, even before Thomas Dewey was named as the Republican presidential nominee, Halleck, as the new chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, addressed a party gathering in Chicago. He rejected the Democrat \\"don't-change-horses-while-crossing-the-stream\\" mantra and declared that a Republican president would retain George C. Marshall, Dwight Eisenhower, Douglas MacArthur, and William F. Halsey in their military positions. He attacked what he called the New Deal \\"snooping into our ice boxes,\\" a reference to the Office of Price Administration and rationing. Halleck said that Americans should \\"live again as God meant us to live and not as some bureaucrat in Washington... would like us to live.\\"David M. Jordan, FDR, Dewey, and the Election of 1944 (Bloomington and Indianapolis: Indiana University Press, 2011), p. 78, According to Halleck, he was rumored to be Thomas Dewey's vice-presidential nominee in Dewey's second general election campaign in 1948 if Halleck guaranteed the support of the Indiana delegation at the 1948 Republican National Convention. In the end, Dewey selected the governor of California, Earl Warren. The Dewey-Warren ticket surprisingly narrowly lost that November, to the Democratic Truman-Barkley ticket. In 1959, with the declining popularity of Eisenhower enabling Democrats to maintain their hold on the House, Halleck parlayed his following among Congressional Republicans and the frequent public approval of Eisenhower and Richard Nixon into a successful challenge to the 20-year reign of Joseph W. Martin, Jr., as the leader of House Republicans. He was a strong opponent of the liberal social proposals of Democrats John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson but supported the Vietnam War and voted in favor of the Civil Rights Acts of 1957, 1960, 1964, and 1968, as well as the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Along with Senator Everett Dirksen, he was the face of the Republican Party in most of the 1960s, and both made frequent appearances on television news and talk programs. The press jocularly nicknamed his joint appearances with Mr. Dirksen the \\"Ev and Charlie Show.\\" After the heavy election setbacks of 1964, Halleck was defeated in his bid to remain Minority Leader by Gerald Ford, who was the nominee of the Young Turks. Legacy In 1983, U.S. President Ronald Reagan signed a bill renaming the Federal District Court building in Lafayette, Indiana, the Charles A. Halleck Federal Building. The Charles Halleck Student Center at Saint Joseph's College in Indiana was named after him. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016. Personal life Halleck was married to the former Blanche Annetta White, who died in 1973. They had two children. His son, Charles A. Halleck Jr., first became an attorney in Washington, DC, and later a United States federal judge. Death Halleck died in Lafayette, Indiana, on March 3, 1986 and is buried next to his wife in Rensselaer. In popular culture *Halleck was portrayed by actor Arthur Franz in the 1974 made-for- television film, The Missiles of October, a dramatization based on John F. Kennedy and the Cuban Missile Crisis.

He was reputedly born in Bosra, east of the Jordan River, around 200 CE, but lived most of his life in Sepphoris.Heinrich Graetz, \\"Gesch.\\" v. 240 Nothing is known of his ancestry except his father's name. He is something of an anomaly among the giants of Torah study as, according to the Babylonian Talmud, he was in his early youth a bandit and a gladiator. He was regarded as one of the most prominent amoraim of the second generation, the other being his brother-in-law and halakhic opponent, Johanan bar Nappaha. Biography =His teachers= According to the Talmud, Reish Lakish, like Yochanan, ascribed his knowledge of the Torah to his good fortune in having been privileged to see Judah haNasi.Yerushalmi Berakhot 63a According to Halevy,\\"Dorot ha-Rishonim\\" he was a pupil of Judah II, grandson of Judah haNasi, in whose name he transmits many sayings. Bacher supposes that he was a pupil of Bar Kappara, since he often hands down sayings in his name.\\"Ag. Pal. Amor.\\" i. 340 He appears also to have attended the academy of Hoshaiah Rabbah, whom he cites,Kiddushin 80a; Me'ilah 7b; Bekhorot 13a questions,Yebamot 57a and calls the \\"father of the Mishnah\\".Yerushalmi Bava Kamma 4c =Banditry= Many stories are told of Shimon's great strength and of his corpulence. He was accustomed to lie on the hard ground, saying, \\"My fat is my cushion\\".Gittin 46b-47a According to the Babylonian Talmud, he was supposed to have been in his early youth a bandit and a gladiator. Under the stress of unfavorable circumstances he gave up the study of the Torah and sought to support himself by a worldly calling. He sold himself to the managers of a gladiator circus, where he could make use of his great bodily strength. He worked as a gladiator, where he was compelled to risk his life continually in combat with wild beasts. According to other sources, Reish Lakish lived for a time in the wilderness where he made his livelihood as a bandit. From this low estate he was brought back to his studies by Rabbi Yochanan. The early commentators speculated that he was a Torah scholar before his life of crime. His criminal career is strictly a Babylonian tradition, as it is not found in any of the sources of the land of Israel; according to the Jerusalem Talmud Shimon spent his entire life immersed in Torah study and his criminal past is completely absent.Binyamin Lau, The Sages Volume IV (English Edition), 2015, pp. 259-266 =Encounter with Yochanan= It is said that Reish Lakish saw Rabbi Yochanan bathing in the Jordan, and mistaking him for a woman, at one bound he was beside him in the water. \\"Thy strength would be more appropriate for studying the Law,\\" said R. Yochanan; \\"And thy beauty for women,\\" answered Reish Lakish. Rabbi Yochanan promised Reish Lakish his sister's hand in marriage if the latter would rejoin the yeshiva and begin his studies anew.Bava Metzia 84a R. Yochanan might be called a teacher of Reish Lakish,Brachot 31a but Reish Lakish, through his talent and diligence, soon became equal in standing to R. Yochanan. They are designated as \\"the two great authorities\\".Yerushalmi Berakhot 12c While R. Yochanan was still in Sepphoris, teaching at the same time as Hanina bar Hama, Reish Lakish stood on an equality with him and enjoyed equal rights as a member of the yeshiva and council.Yerushalmi Sanhedrin 18c; Yerushalmi Niddah 2 50b When R. Yochanan went to Tiberias and founded an academy there, Shimon accompanied him and took the second position in the academy.Compare Bava Metziah 117a =His accomplishments and character traits= Shimon exceeded even Yochanan in acuteness, and Yochanan admitted that his right hand was missing when Shimon was not present.Yerushalmi Sanhedrin 2 19d, 20a \\"When [Shimon] discussed halakhic questions, it was as if he were uprooting mountains and rubbing them together,\\" says Ulla.Sanhedrin 24a Yochanan was often compelled by Shimon's logic to surrender his own opinion and accept that of Shimon,Yerushalmi Yoma 38a and even to act in accordance with Shimon's views.Yerushalmi Eruvin 18c Yet it is said in praise of Shimon that all his objections to Yochanan's conclusions were founded on the Mishnah, and that with him it was not a question of showing himself to be in the right, but of securing a clear and well-established decision, and that when he could find no support for his opinion he was not ashamed to abandon it.Yerushalmi Gittin 3 44d He had a strong love of truth and an unusually courageous way of saying what he thought. He even declared to the Patriarch Judah II that fear of the latter would never induce him to keep back God's word or any opinion derived from it;Yerushalmi Sanhedrin 20a and once he ventured to convey a veiled rebuke to the patriarch for avarice.Genesis Rabbah 78:16 Neither did he hesitate to revoke decisions of his colleagues, including Yochanan, even when action had already been taken in accordance with those decisions.Yerushalmi Ketuvot 32d, 37a; Bava Batra 16b; Ketuvot 54b, 84b On one occasion, when Yochanan presented a halakhic demonstration before Yannai, and the latter praised him for it, Shimon boldly declared, \\"In spite of Rabbi Yannai's great praise, R. Yochanan's opinion is not correct\\".Yerushalmi Sotah 2 18b He would defend his views fearlessly before the whole faculty,Kiddushin 44a and sometimes he ventured to give a decision that conflicted with the Mishnah.Yerushalmi Terumot 7 44c; Yerushalmi Hagigah 3 79c Nevertheless, his opinions, when they differed from those of Yochanan, were not recognized as valid, except in three cases mentioned in the Babylonian Talmud.Yebamot 36a No one equaled Shimon ben Lakish in diligence and eagerness to learn. It was his custom regularly to repeat a section from the Mishnah forty times;Ta'anit 8a he boasted that even Hiyya the Great, who was renowned for his diligence, was no more diligent than he.Yerushalmi Ketubot 12:3 In order to urge his pupils to continual diligence, he often quoted a proverb which he ascribed to the Torah: \\"If you leave me one day, I shall leave you for two\\".Yerushalmi Berachot 9 14d His conscientiousness and delicately balanced sense of honor are also celebrated. He avoided association with people of whose honesty he was not fully convinced; hence the testimony of any one allowed to associate with Shimon ben Lakish was accredited even in the absence of witnesses.Yoma 9b Shimon ben Lakish was faithful to his friends, and was ever ready to render them active assistance. This is shown by the way in which, at the risk of his own life, he rescued Rabbi Assi, who had been imprisoned and was regarded as practically dead by his colleagues.Yerushalmi Terumot 46b Once his vigorous interference saved Yochanan's property from injury.ibid. =Death= In his aggadot Shimon frequently makes use of similes, some of which recall the days when he won a livelihood in the circus. In general, he spoke unreservedly of that time; yet an allusion to his earlier banditry wounded him so deeply that he became ill and died. This happened as follows: Once there was a dispute over when different kinds of knives and weapons are susceptible to ritual impurity. The opinion of Shimon ben Lakish differed from that of Yochanan, whereupon Yochanan remarked, \\"A robber knows his own tools\\".Bava Metziah 84a Yochanan alluded to Shimon's life as a bandit, in which a knowledge of sharp weapons was a matter of course. Reish Lakish responded by supposedly denying any benefit he had received from Yochanan; \\"When I was a bandit they called me 'master', and now they call me 'master.'\\" Yochanan retorted angrily that he had brought him under the wings of the Shekhinah. The Talmud relates that due to Yochanan becoming so upset, Reish Lakish became ill and prematurely died. Struck with guilt, Yochanan was in despair at the death of Shimon. When the academy sent Eleazar ben Pedat to act as his study partner, Yochanan accused him of being a yes-man and pined for the times when Shimon would argue back- and-forth with him to get to the correct conclusion. It is said that he kept calling, \\"Where is Bar Lekisha, where is Bar Lekisha?\\" His despondency was so great, that he is recorded as eventually losing his sanity. Teachings The independence which Shimon ben Lakish manifested in the discussion of halakha was equally pronounced in his treatment of aggadah. In aggadah, too, he held a prominent position, and advanced many original and independent views which struck his contemporaries with amazement and which did not win respect until later. His aggadot include exegetical and homiletical interpretations of the Scriptures; observations concerning Biblical characters and stories; sayings concerning the Commandments, prayer, the study of the Law, God, the angels, Creation mythology, Israel, and Rome, Messianic and eschatological subjects, as well as other dicta and proverbs. His aggadic teachings include: * \\"Should the sons of Israel find rest with the people among whom they are scattered, they would lose their desire to return to Israel, the land of their fathers\\"Lamentations Rabbah 1:3 * \\"Israel is dear to God, and He takes no pleasure in any one that utters calumnies against Israel\\"Shir haShirim Rabbah 1:6 * \\"The proselyte, however, is dearer to God than was Israel when it was gathered together at Sinai, because Israel would not have received the Law of God without the miracles of its revelation, whereas the proselyte, without seeing a single miracle, has consecrated himself to God and accepted the kingdom of heaven\\".Tanhuma, Lech Lecha, ed. Buber, p. 32a * \\"The words of the Torah can be remembered only by one who sacrifices himself for the sake of studying them\\".Berachot 63b; Shabbat 83b * \\"Israel took the names of the angels from the Babylonians during the period of the Exile, because Isaiah [6:6] speaks only of 'one of the seraphim' without calling him by name; whereas Daniel names the angels Michael and Gabriel\\"Yerushalmi Rosh Hashana 56d * \\"The adversary (sa·π≠an), the evil inclination, and the angel of death, are one and the same being.\\"Bava Batra 16a * \\"Job never actually existed; he is only the imaginary hero of the poem, the invention of the poet\\"Yerushalmi Sotah 20d His aggadah is especially rich in maxims and proverbs, including: * \\"No man commits a sin unless struck by momentary insanity\\" Sotah 3a * \\"Adorn thyself first; afterward adorn others\\" [i.e., lead by example]Bava Metziah 107b * \\"Greater is he that lends than he that gives alms; but he that aids by taking part in a business undertaking is greater than either.\\"Shabbat 63a * \\"Do not live in the neighborhood of an ignorant man who is pious\\" * \\"Who commits the sin of adultery only with the eyes is an adulterer\\"Leviticus Rabbah 23:12 * \\"May the judgment for a prutah be as dear to you as the judgment for a hundred [prutot].\\"Sanhedrin 8a References * Category:Talmud rabbis of the Land of Israel Category:Baalei teshuva Category:3rd-century rabbis Category:Roman gladiators ","title":"Shimon ben Lakish"},{"id":"2439808","text":"Margam Country Park is a country park estate in Wales, of around 850 acres (3.4 km¬≤). It is situated in Margam, about 2 miles (3 km) from Port Talbot in south Wales. It was once owned by the Mansel Talbot family and is now owned and administered by the local council, Neath Port Talbot County Borough Council. Situated within the park are three notable buildings: Margam Abbey, a Cistercian monastery; Margam Castle, a neo-Gothic country house that was once the seat of the Mansel Talbot family; and the 18th-century Orangery. Country park Margam abbey c.1865 The Orangery, Margam. Photographed in the 1850s Margam Park owes its location and beginnings to the monastery, which was acquired by Sir Rice Mansel in 1540 after the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1537. A Tudor mansion was later built on the site of the former monastic ranges by Sir Rice Mansel as a county residence. In 1661, the first mention of a garden is referenced, including walled areas and by 1727 the estate's gardener drew up a catalogue of the plants at the gardens. 1793 saw the completion of the Orangery, the masterpiece of eighteenth century architect Anthony Keck,The Buildings of Wales: Glamorgan, page 429 and by the late 18th century the gardens were fenced off from the park to keep out the deer, and a main gate was erected. An 1814 estate map shows that a working park had been realised, with a 'Great', 'Little' and 'Upper' Parks, and by 1830 the construction of a new manor house, to become Margam Castle, had begun. Before the end of the decade, plans show the inclusion of several new buildings and features, including the Temple of the Four Seasons, the stone facade and the gardener's cottage. The Margam Estate was acquired by Glamorgan County Council in July 1973, and the next year, after a Local Government re-organisation, the Park fell under the ownership of West Glamorgan County Council. The park was opened to the public in 1977. in 1985 a sculpture park was established by the Welsh Sculpture Trust which exhibited work by internationally famous sculptors including Henry Moore, Barbara Hepworth and Elizabeth Frink. The sculpture park has since closed. The estate is noted for its peacock population. Also on the estate are deer, which have existed on the site since at least Norman times. The majority are fallow deer (numbering around 230); red deer (about 60) and the non-native P√®re David's Deer (about 30) were introduced in the 1990s, the latter as part of a breeding programme. Venison from the management of the deer herd is sold to the public. Aviaries on the estate house a number of rescued birds of prey. The rare breed Glamorgan cattle are raised on the estate. The Coed Morgannwg Way, the Ogwr Ridgeway Walk and the St Illtyd's Walk long-distance paths all begin/finish around Mynydd y Castell within Margam Country Park. An inland section of the Wales Coast Path runs through the park along the escarpment above the motorway, and there are a number of shorter (less than three miles (5 km)) walks waymarked in the park. There are no major rivers in the park, but there are lakes and ponds, and it is possible to fish some of the ponds. The narrow gauge Margam Park Railway conducts visitors around the grounds in the summer. The Orangery has a licence for civil marriages. Events on the estate are held through the summer: ranging from fairs selling particular goods to car rallies. The Margam Country Show is held in August. In 2003, the park was host to the Urdd Eisteddfod. In a 2013 the park came first in a national vote to find the public's favourite Green Flag Awarded park from a field of 1,448 qualifying open spaces. Access is free but there is a charge for car parking and for some events. The park has been used as one of the most infamous stages of Wales Rally GB, being used as the final stage of both the rally and the season, and witnessing many championship celebrations and losses. Scheduled monuments The country park has six Scheduled Ancient Monuments within it. Two of these are Iron Age hill forts, two are medieval religious sites, one is a museum and one is a World War II installation. =Iron Age camps= Mynydd y Castell Camp is a large hillfort enclosing in a D shape, on an isolated hill 500m east of Margam Abbey. There has been some quarrying, and possible other uses, which may have disrupted layouts of banks and entrances.. : Mynydd y Castell Camp Half Moon Camp is a small Hillfort on a hilltop north of Margam Abbey, on the opposite side of the valley from Mynydd y Castell.

When the abbey was dissolved in 1536 the Abbey Church nave was retained as Margam Parish Church, whilst the ruins of various other of the abbey buildings stand in the park today, including a spectacular twelve-sided Chapter House. A small chapel known as Hen Eglwys, also called Cryke Chapel and dated to 1470, was a grange of the Abbey on the hillside of Craig-y-capel. The gable-ends, with window tracery are the principle survivals, and provided a gothic landmark and viewpoint for the 19th-century parkland of Margam Castle. There was a burial ground and a nearby holy well known as Ffynnon Mair.. : Hen Eglwys. =Margam Stones= During the 19th Century the Talbot family gathered together a collection of early Christian memorial stones from the locality, and placed them in and around the Abbey Chapter House, within what is now the Park. In 1892 they were put in the care of the Commissioners for Public works, and in 1932 they were moved into the nearby Church schoolroom, to become the Margam Stones Museum, now managed by Cadw.Sign boards at the museum, undated, viewed in the Museum in June 2012 =Margam Castle= Margam Orangery The Park also houses Margam Castle, a Tudor Gothic mansion house built by Christopher Rice Mansel Talbot in the early nineteenth century. Sculptures and artwork are placed at different places along the paths which connect the house with the Orangery. =Early warning radar= Margam Coast Defence Radar Station On the escarpment above the motorway is one of a network of early warning radar stations that were built around the coast of Britain from 1941, to detect German bombers and shipping during World War II. Earlier Chain Home stations were able to spot aircraft at higher altitudes, so a second network, the Chain Home Low stations, of which Margam was one, were built to detect low-flying planes and shipping. The Margam station, which is a Scheduled Ancient Monument, has the inland route of the Wales Coast Path running past it. Three flat-topped buildings stand high on the escarpment, overlooking Port Talbot and Swansea Bay. They would have housed generators and control equipment, with a large antenna on the roof.. : Chain Home Low Radar Station, Margam See also *List of gardens in Wales *List of Scheduled Monuments in Neath Port Talbot Notes Bibliography Newman, J.

Early life  Princess Saint Joan with the Infant Jesus; by Joao Baptista Pachim, 18th century Joanna was the second child of Afonso, but after the early death of her older brother John she was recognized as heir presumptive and given the title of Princess of Portugal. Other children of the king were infantes. Upon the birth of her younger brother, the future John II of Portugal, she ceased to be heir presumptive, but among the people she continued to be known as Princess Joan. From a young age, Joan expressed a desire to become a nun; however, as she was second-in-line to the throne, her father did not allow it.Capes, Florence. \\"Blessed Joanna of Portugal.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 8. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 25 Jul. 2014 During his military expedition to Tangier in 1471, Joan served as Regent of the Portuguese Kingdom.  Marriage Proposals  After vehemently refusing several proposals of marriage, Joan joined the Dominican Convent of Jesus in Aveiro in 1475. Her brother had, by then, been given an heir, so the family line was no longer in danger of extinction. Still, she was compelled several times to leave the convent and return to the court. She turned down an offer of marriage from Charles VIII of France, 18 years her junior. In 1485, she received another offer, from the recently widowed Richard III of England, who was only 8 months younger. This was to be part of a double marital alliance, with his niece Elizabeth of York marrying her cousin, the future Manuel I. However, his death in battle, of which Joan allegedly had a prophetic dream, halted these plans.  Late Life  She continued to be a great supporter of her brother, John II of Portugal, throughout his reign and her life. Joan died on 12 May 1490 in Aveiro and was buried in the Convent of Jesus in Aveiro. She was beatified in 1693 by Pope Innocent XII. Although she has not been canonized, in Portugal she is known as the Princess Saint Joan.  Revival  In the early 18th century, the Portuguese nobility, clergy, and court had a revival in interest in the princess. During this time, the Portuguese artist Manuel Ferreira e Sousa was the most famous artist in this revival. He was contracted by various religious institutions, noblemen, and even the royal family to paint scenes from her life.

The name of the city 'Lagos' already means 'lakes' in the Portuguese language so 'Lagos Lagoon' is an example of a tautological place name. Physical characteristics The lagoon is more than 50 km long and 3 to 13 km wide, separated from the Atlantic Ocean by a long sand spit 2 to 5 km wide, which has swampy margins on the lagoon side. Its surface area is approximately 6,354.7 km¬≤.Lagos Lagoon Coastal Profile: Information Database For Planning Theory, by Obafemi McArthur Okusipe, Department of Urban and Regional Planning, University of Lagos - Accessed September 22, 2008 The lagoon is fairly shallow and is not plied by ocean-going ships, but by smaller barges and boats. The lagoon receives the discharge of the Ogun River and the Osun River. Geography Map showing relative position of Lagos Lagoon to urban areas, harbour and port areas of Lagos Metropolitan Area Lagos Lagoon empties into the Atlantic via Lagos Harbour, a main channel through the heart of the city, 0.5 km to 1 km wide and 10 km long. The principal ocean port of Lagos is located at Apapa in a broad western branch off the main channel of the harbour. Another branch off the main channel, narrower and longer, separates Lagos Island from Victoria Island, the broad sand spit which forms the coastline. The city spreads along more than 30 km of the lagoon's south- western and western shoreline. Pollution by urban and industrial waste is a major problem as a large amount of wastewater is released into the lagoon daily. The 11-km-long Third Mainland Bridge was built off the western shore to by-pass congested mainland suburbs. To its north-east the lagoon is connected by a channel passing south of the town of Epe to the Lekki Lagoon. Narrow winding channels connect the system through a broad band of coastal swamps and rivers, as far away as Sapele, 250 km to the east. The areas west of Lagos Lagoon are not well provided with roads and many communities there traditionally relied on water transport. In the middle of the lagoon are the Palaver Islands.

Early years and education Fari√±a was born in Brooklyn, New York, the son of an Irish mother, Theresa Crozier, and a Cuban father, also named Richard Fari√±a. He grew up in the Flatbush neighborhood of Brooklyn and attended Brooklyn Technical High School.Hajdu, David. Positively Fourth Street. p. 39. He earned an academic scholarship to Cornell University, starting as an engineering major, but later switching to English.Hajdu, David. Positively Fourth Street. p. 41. While at Cornell he published short stories for local literary magazines and for national periodicals, including Transatlantic Review and Mademoiselle.Hajdu, David. Positively Fourth Street. p. 308. Fari√±a became good friends with Thomas Pynchon, David Shetzline, and Peter Yarrow while at Cornell. He was suspended for alleged participation in a student demonstration against campus regulations, and although he later resumed his status as a student, he dropped out in 1959, just before graduation. Ascent on Greenwich Village folk scene Back in Manhattan, Fari√±a became a regular patron of the White Horse Tavern, the well-known Greenwich Village tavern frequented by poets, artists, and folksingers, where he befriended Tommy Makem. It was there that he met Carolyn Hester, a successful folk singer. They married 18 days later. Fari√±a appointed himself Hester's agent; they toured worldwide while Fari√±a worked on his novel and Carolyn performed gigs. Fari√±a was present when Hester recorded her third album at Columbia studios during September 1961, where a then- little-known Bob Dylan played the harmonica on several tracks. Fari√±a became a good friend of Dylan; their friendship is a major topic of David Hajdu's book, Positively 4th Street: The Lives and Times of Joan Baez, Bob Dylan, Mimi Baez Fari√±a, and Richard Fari√±a. Fari√±a then travelled to Europe, where he met Mimi Baez, the teenage sister of Joan Baez, in the spring of 1962. Hester divorced Fari√±a soon thereafter, and Fari√±a married 17-year-old Mimi in April 1963. Thomas Pynchon was the best man. They moved to a small cabin in Carmel, California, where they composed songs with a guitar and Appalachian dulcimer. They debuted their act as \\"Richard & Mimi Fari√±a\\" at the Big Sur Folk Festival in 1964 and signed a contract with Vanguard Records. They recorded their first album, Celebrations for a Grey Day (released under the name Mimi & Richard Fari√±a), in 1965, with the help of Bruce Langhorne, who had previously played for Dylan. During the brief life of Richard Fari√±a, the couple released only one other album, Reflections in a Crystal Wind, also in 1965. A third album, Memories, was issued in 1968, after his death. Fari√±a, like Dylan and others of this time, was considered a protest singer, and several of his songs are overtly political. Several critics have considered Fari√±a to be a major folk music talent of the 1960s. (\\"If Richard had survived that motorcycle accident, he would have easily given Dylan a run for his money.\\" ‚Äì Ed Ward). His best- known songs are \\"Pack Up Your Sorrows\\" and \\"Birmingham Sunday\\", the latter of which was recorded by Joan Baez and became better known after it became the theme song for Spike Lee's film 4 Little Girls, a documentary about the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing in Birmingham, Alabama in 1963. \\"Birmingham Sunday\\" was also recorded by Rhiannon Giddens in 2017, on her album \\"Freedom Highway.\\" At the time of his death, Fari√±a was producing an album for his sister-in-law Joan Baez. She ultimately decided not to release the album. Two of the songs were included on Fari√±a's posthumous album, and another, a cover version of Fari√±a's \\"Pack Up Your Sorrows\\", co-written by Fari√±a with the third Baez sister, Pauline Marden, was released as a single in 1966; it has been included in a number of Baez' compilation albums. Been Down So Long It Looks Like Up to Me Fari√±a is known for his novel Been Down So Long It Looks Like Up to Me, originally published by Random House in 1966. The title comes from the Furry Lewis song \\"I Will Turn Your Money Green\\" (\\"I been down so long/It seem like up to me\\"). The novel, based largely on his college experiences and travels, is a picaresque novel, set in 1958 in the American West, in Cuba during the Cuban Revolution, and mostly at Cornell University (called Mentor University in the novel). The protagonist is Gnossos Pappadopoulis, who enjoys dope, feta cheese, Red Cap ale and retsina; attacks authority figures with anarchic glee; and lusts after the girl in the green knee-socks while searching for the right karma. The book has become a cult classic among fans of the 1960s and counterculture literature. Thomas Pynchon, who later dedicated his book Gravity's Rainbow (1973) to Fari√±a, described Fari√±a's novel as \\"coming on like the Hallelujah Chorus done by 200 kazoo players with perfect pitch... hilarious, chilling, sexy, profound, maniacal, beautiful, and outrageous all at the same time.\\" Death On April 30, 1966, two days after the publication of his novel, Fari√±a attended a book-signing ceremony at a Carmel Valley Village bookstore, the Thunderbird. Later that day, while at a party to celebrate his wife Mimi Fari√±a's twenty-first birthday, Fari√±a saw a guest with a motorcycle, who later gave Fari√±a a ride up Carmel Valley Road, heading east toward the rural Cachagua area of Carmel Valley. At an S-turn the driver lost control. The motorcycle tipped over on the right side of the road, came back to the other side, and tore through a barbed wire fence into a field where a small vineyard now exists. The driver survived, but Fari√±a was killed instantly. According to Pynchon's preface to Been Down..., the police said the motorcycle must have been traveling at , even though \\"a prudent speed\\" would have been . Fari√±a is buried in a simple grave, its marker emblazoned with a peace sign, at Monterey City Cemetery in Monterey, California. Legacy * On April 27, 1968, Fairport Convention recorded a live version of \\"Reno Nevada\\" for French TV programme Bouton Rouge, featuring vocals by Judy Dyble and Iain Matthews. They recorded the song for a BBC session later in the same year, this time with Dyble's replacement in the band Sandy Denny, subsequently included on the album Heyday. Denny also recorded \\"The Quiet Joys of Brotherhood\\" for her 1972 album Sandy. Matthews later recorded \\"Reno Nevada\\" and \\"Morgan the Pirate\\" for his album \\"If You Saw Thro' My Eyes\\" as well as \\"House of Un-American Blues Activity Dream\\" for his album \\"Tigers Will Survive\\", and other Fari√±a compositions appeared on subsequent Matthews solo albums and on recordings by Matthews' band Plainsong. * South Carolina-based rock band A Fragile Tomorrow covered a version of Mimi and Richard's song \\"One Way Ticket\\" on their 2015 release Make Me Over.

It is in the parish of Stocksfield and is just to the south of Stocksfield in Northumberland with Broomley to the west and Whittonstall to the east. It is south of the River Tyne. Hindley is composed of a large house, Hindley Hall (now split up into three houses and four flats), a farm (now converted into residences) and a post box. History Hindley is likely to have developed from a farm due to its close proximity to Dere Street (a Roman road between York and into Scotland, passing through nearby Corbridge). Local records have that in 1296 there were two poll-tax payers, a Shepard and a Smith. The first dated reference to Hindley is dated 25 April 1232, and is an agreement between Sir William de Hindley and Robert de St. Jerman regarding land near Midhope. A history of Northumberland Vol. VI In 1256 at the Northumberland Assizes, Hindley is mentioned again in reference to the death of a woman, and the Vills of Hindley were presented for not pursuing marauders after the robbing of someone's house. A history of Northumberland Vol. VI The land at Hindley has passed through several local families, Boutflower, Ridley, Surtees, and it is clear that there has never been large settlement in Hindley, from Parish records, which began in 1663. It is not known how Hindley passed into the possession of Mr. Edward Montagu of Denton and of Allerthorpe in Yorkshire (grandson of 2nd Earl of Sandwich, although it is possible he acquired the land through the will of John Rogers. It was sold by his widow, Mrs. Elizabeth Montagu, the famous 'blue stocking', on 12 May 1787, to George Potts of Netherton, in Bedlingtonshire, who by his will, dated 29 November 1797, gave it to his only son, Matthew Potts. At this time Hindley was regarded to be in the Township of Old Ridley. The 1841 census indicates two families living in Hindley. George Angus, a farmer with four agricultural workers and three female servants, living with his family, presumably in the farmhouse. Hindley Farmhouse was used for Baptist meetings for 150 years until 1863, when it burnt down. Also mentioned in the census is John Surtees, a surgeon, living with his family of four children. John Surtees is related to the famous R. S. Surtees, author of the Jorrocks Stories. In 1849 the Hindley Estate consisting of 366 acres of land, 30 of which were woodland, was sold at auction. Mr John Featherstone Ayton bought the land at Hindley for ¬£5050, being the only bidder. He occupied the estate, living in Hindley Cottage, presumably overseeing the building of Hindley Hall. In 1861 the Hall was finished and Ayton lived there with his wife Ann Maria, both aged 43, with their seven children (six sons and one daughter), and they had five servants. Three of Ayton's sons were being schooled in Germany at the time, and the enumerator had \\"crossed out the three names\\" and they were therefore not listed in the census returns. Mr Ayton wrote to the Home Office to protest at the enumerator's action, arguing that \\"the three boys really form part of the population of The United Kingdom\\". The Home Office, however, concluded that \\"the Enumerator was quite right\\". In 1874 William Foster bought the Hall for ¬£19,000 and considerably enlarged the Hall. By the 1881 Census, Mary Foster, a widow, lived in the Hall with her son Alfred J. Foster, aged 17, and two servants. The census also shows William Forster Fairbridge (or Farbridge) his wife Jane and ten children living in Hindley Lodge (now called Northwood Lodge). The estate, still was valued at ¬£13,500 in 1889. The farmhouse, valued separately \\"as it is really too good for the farm\\", was valued at ¬£800. This building is probably Hindley House. In 1947 the hall was sold to Gateshead Corporation and, by 1953, 26 acres of land had also been purchased. The corporation intended to use the building as a residential school for around 60 pupils. The East wing (now the apartments) and a gym were built in the 1950s and 1960s using stone hauled from the ruined Ravensworth Castle (once owned by the Liddell Family). Accommodation for two assistant masters was built and a bungalow for the Headmaster had been built in 1958, although this no longer stands. A greenhouse was erected and a kitchen garden was provided to train pupils.

Heslop's Northumbrian Words he suggests the 'Hindberry' (or raspberry), this is quite likely to be the root as other local names also have their names derived from plants; Broomley and Slaley. An alternative explanation could be that it is derived from 'Hind' (a female Red Deer) relating to the deer found in the area.  Geography  Hindley is situated in the Tyne Valley, roughly fifteen miles west of Newcastle and situated between Hexham and Prudhoe. Nearby are the villages of Stocksfield, Broomley, Bywell, New Ridley and Riding Mill. To the north of Hindley runs a burn called Hindley Burn, this is a tributary of the River Tyne. Economy Gainford Design is a graphic design company based in Hindley Hall. Gainford Design Website Two miles north of Hindley is Wheelbirks Farm, a Jersey Cow farm, which specialises in producing Ice Cream and also has a coffee and Ice cream shop attached, called the Parlour, opened in 2010. Wheelbirks Website Transport Road Hindley lies on the B6309 giving access to Stamfordham, Ebchester, Consett and Durham. The B6309 links with the A695 and the A69, offering links with neighbouring villages and towns, Newcastle upon Tyne, Gateshead, Hexham and Carlisle. Within walking distance (1.5 miles) is the Stocksfield Station Bus Stop. Local buses stopping at this stop are the 40, 602 and the X66, providing links with Hexham, Corbridge, Prudhoe, Ryton, The Metrocentre and Newcastle. There is also a bus service running to Hexham from Hindley once a week on a Tuesday. Railway Hindley is located away from the nearest railway station, Stocksfield railway station, which is on the Newcastle and Carlisle Railway, and has an hourly service running daily.Newcastle and Carlisle Railway Timetable Valid until 19 May 2009 References External links * Broomley and Stocksfield Parish Council website * Northumberland County Council Website Category:Hamlets in Northumberland ","title":"Hindley, Northumberland"},{"id":"2439847","text":"A special effects movie camera stand with aerial image capabilities.

He was an outstanding bowler who is generally regarded as the first great bowler in the game's history. He was universally known by his nickname and was always called \\"Lumpy\\" in contemporary scorecards and reports. Cricket career Stevens was born in 1735 at Send, Surrey. The beginning of Stevens' career was before scorecards began to be kept on a regular basis. Stevens probably began playing in great matches around the mid-1750s at a time when bowlers still bowled (i.e., trundled) the ball all along the ground, as in crown green bowls. It is not known if Stevens was the first to \\"give the ball air\\" but he was certainly around when that particular revolution occurred, probably before 1770. What is known is that Stevens was the bowler who made the most careful study of flight and worked out all the implications of variations in pace, length and direction mentioned above. He became a master of his craft.. Unlike the Hambledon players who tended to represent their club only, Stevens made appearances for just about every team, including Hambledon. He is normally associated with Surrey teams in general and with the famous Chertsey club in particular. He continued as a player until he was 50 and played his last match on 2‚Äì5 September 1789 for All-England v Hampshire at Sevenoaks Vine.See scorecard in CricketArchive. It is not known what took place in his career following this game, but John Major suspected that Stevens enlisted in the British Army: on 20 May 1793 a letter signed by 'A Kentish Cricketer' written to Sporting Magazine describes an incident where an Ensign Hamilton, a member of the Sevenoaks Vine Club, had a cannonball deflected away from his head by a Sergeant. The magazine and the Maidstone Journal both linked the story to Stevens. Style and technique How he came by his legendary nickname is uncertainJohn Nyren, The Cricketers of my Time (ed. Ashley Mote), Robson, 1998. but it may have been because he was adept at choosing a pitch to suit his very subtle variations of pace, length and direction. In the 18th century, choice of pitch was granted to one team according to the rules in situ and it was generally the leading bowler on that team who chose the place where the wickets would be pitched. According to the famous verse: ::For honest Lumpy did allow ::He ne'er would pitch but o'er a browArthur Haygarth, Scores & Biographies, Volume 1 (1744‚Äì1826), Lillywhite, 1862. Family and personal life Stevens was a gardener by trade and his bowling prowess earned him a job on the Walton-on-Thames estate of the Earl of Tankerville, a noted patron of the game. Legacy It is known that in a single wicket match on 22‚Äì23 May 1775, Stevens beat the great Hambledon batsman John Small three times with the ball going through the two stump wicket of the day. As a result of his protests, the patrons agreed that a third stump should be added.

It was formerly known as Mimulus guttatus. Erythranthe guttata is a model organism for biological studies, and in that context is still referred to as Mimulus guttatus. There may be as many as 1000 scientific papers focused on this species. The genome is (as of 2012) being studied in depth. Description The lower lip may have one large to many small red to reddish brown spots. The opening to the flower is hairy. A highly variable plant, taking many forms, E. guttata is a species complex in that there is room to treat some of its forms as different species by some definitions. Erythranthe guttata is 10 to 80 cm tall with disproportionately large, 20 to 40 mm long, tubular flowers. The perennial form spreads with stolons or rhizomes. The stem may be erect or recumbent. In the latter form, roots may develop at leaf nodes. Sometimes dwarfed, it may be hairless or have some hairs. Leaves are opposite, round to oval, usually coarsely and irregularly toothed or lobed. The bright yellow flowers are born on a raceme, most often with five or more flowers. The calyx has five lobes that are much shorter than the flower. Each flower has bilateral symmetry and has two lips. The upper lip usually has two lobes; the lower, three. The lower lip may have one large to many small red to reddish brown spots. The opening to the flower is hairy. Erythranthe guttata is pollinated by bees, such as Bombus species. Inbreeding reduces flower quantity and size and pollen quality and quantity. E. guttata also displays a high degree of self-pollination. Erythranthe nasuta (Mimulus nasutus) evolved from E. guttata in central California between 200,000 and 500,000 years ago and since then has become primarily a self-pollinator. Other differences have occurred since then, such as genetic code variations and variations in plant morphology. E. guttata prefers a wetter habitat than E. nasuta. Distribution A herbaceous wildflower, Erythranthe guttata grows along the banks of streams and seeps throughout much of western North America from sea level to . Both annual and perennial forms occur throughout the species' range. It blooms during spring at low elevations, during summer at high elevations. It is found in a wide range of habitats including the splash zone of the Pacific Ocean, the chaparral of California, Western U.S. deserts, the geysers of Yellowstone National Park, alpine meadows, serpentine barrens, and even on the toxic tailings of copper mines. It is also very common in New Zealand near water bodies. It is sometimes aquatic, its herbage floating in small bodies of water. Cultivation Erythranthe guttata is cultivated in the specialty horticulture trade and available as an ornamental plant for: traditional gardens; natural landscape, native plant, and habitat gardens.

In his career spanning over half a century, he appeared in about 144 films and television series. Biography Born in Akola, British India in 1908, Barr was educated at Radley College and Trinity College, Oxford, where he rowed in the 1929 Boat Race and achieved a Blue. He went from stage to screen with The Merry Men of Sherwood (1932). He spent the 1930s playing various beneficent authority figures and \\"reliable friend\\" types. As a conscientious objector during the Second World War, Barr helped people in the Blitz in London's East End before serving with the Friends Ambulance Unit in Africa. There he met his wife Anne \\"Jean\\" Williams, marrying her after ten days; it would have been sooner, but they needed permission from London. In 1946, he picked up where he had left off, and in the early 1950s he began working in British television, attaining a popularity greater than he had while playing supporting parts in such films as The Case of the Frightened Lady (1940) and The Blue Lagoon (1949). This popularity enabled Barr to obtain better roles and command a higher salary for his films of the 1950s and 1960s. Some of the films in which he appeared during this period were The Dam Busters (1955), Room in the House (1955), Saint Joan (1957), Next to Next Time (1960), Billy Liar (1963), The First Great Train Robbery (1979) and Octopussy (1983). On television, he appeared in Doctor Who in 1967 as Hobson in the serial entitled The Moonbase; in the 1970 Randall & Hopkirk (Deceased) episode \\"You Can Always Find a Fall Guy\\" and appeared once in The Avengers.

The town was created during the construction of the Canadian Northern Railway (CNR) through the area in the early years of the 20th century. Folyet is also the name for the geographic township that contains the community. (township) A designated place administered by a local services board,http://www.canlii.org/on/laws/regu/1990r.737/20030205/whole.html Foleyet had a population of 193 in the Canada 2011 Census. History In the early 1900s, Canadian Northern Railway decided to build a railroad through the area Foleyet now occupies. The Foley Brothers and Northern Construction were the two contractors who were hired to do the job. Construction began in 1911 and was completed in 1915. The goal of the construction was to unite the western lines from Current Junction, now part of Thunder Bay, to the eastern section, between Toronto and Ruel, which was accomplished in 1912. While this work was going on, a line was also being put in from Ottawa to Capreol. On June 15, 1915, the first work train arrived from Capreol. The engineer was Jim Scott. The train carried men to build bridges over Ivanhoe River, Muskego River, and Groundhog River. The railway station at Foleyet was originally called Foley. Local legend has it that the early residents applied for a post office named to honour their former employer the Foley Brothers, but were frustrated in their wishes because the name Foley Post Office already existed near Parry Sound. The story is told that someone declared that \\"We want to name the town for the Foley Brothers, and we'll name it Foley yet!\\" and the unintended name stuck. Located about midway between Capreol and Hornepayne, Foleyet was established as a divisional point, for changing train crews and servicing rolling stock, and there was with a large railway roundhouse as well. The town started with 15 houses. The Canadian Northern Railway built a large sawmill, west of the station, equipped with a pulp barker, planing mill, and a powerhouse. This mill, although owned by the railway, operated under the name Eastern Lands Division. Lumber was sold wholesale to railway employees, for home construction. A lumber yard was also established at Capreol. The Eastern Lands Co. built their main office here. They cut white pine, red pine, spruce pulp logs, and jack pine axe ties. The smallest Canadian Northern steam locomotive was at Foleyet. It was an Alco 0-4-0 Saddle Tank, on the Canadian National Roster as CNR # 3. It was used at the sawmill and sold to Acme Timber in 1925. Art Boyer was the engineer. From Canadian Northern to Canadian National Eastern Lands Division continued their operations there until April 1925, at which time the mill was sold to Acme Timber Co. of Sudbury. Acme was a major supplier of timber to Inco. This firm was started around 1923 by D. H. Haight, who had been supplying mining timber and fuel wood to the International Nickel Co. since the early 1900s. Haight, a native of New Jersey, was a cousin of Inco's first president Ambrose Monell. The general manager of Acme Timber Co. was Haight's brother-in-law, Ben Foote Merwin. In 1932, Merwin organized Pineland Timber Co. which took over Acme in 1934. In 1917, a dam was built, creating a new river by joining Midway Creek and Muskego Rivers. The dam broke a year later, flooding Foleyet and lowering the lake levels significantly once again. The town has had many such disasters, in the form of fires and floods, and much of its landscape differs completely now from its origins. Often when a new progress was made or added, it was simply destroyed years later. The land occupied by Foleyet was originally an island, before an esker was destroyed and the lake receded dramatically. Ivanhoe Lake (then known as Pishkanogami, the Anishinaabe name for it) was how the area was first explored, before Foleyet became a town. The Hudson's Bay Company had two outposts nearby, one on Lake Pishkanogami, and one on Kukatush (Groundhog) Lake. Both were closed in the 1880s due to a decline in the fur trade. It was only in 1960 that Lake Pishkanogami became Ivanhoe Lake or lac Ivanhoe in French. The town, at present, is known as the home of the white moose. In 1998, one such moose was hit by a train, and after a day of suffering was killed by a CN worker. The head of the moose is mounted in the Northern Lights Restaurant. Demographics Transportation The community is served by Ontario Highway 101. It is also the location of Foleyet railway station, on the Canadian National Railway transcontinental main line, served by Via Rail Canadian trains. Education Foleyet had two schools to support its small community, roughly half francophone. Foleyet Public School closed down around 2014 and √âcole Notre Dame, the latter a French separate school remains open to this day. Neither school has had more than 10 students at any one time since the early 2000s.  Train quarantine  Ontario Ministry of Health air ambulance helicopter at the scene of the \\"Foleyet emergency quarantine\\" On May 9, 2008, a woman died of natural causes on a train operated by Via Rail. Ten of the 264 passengers were showing flu-like symptoms; however, these turned out to be unrelated to the earlier death. As the train was held in quarantine for ten hours, the item made the national Canadian and other international news media.

Inexpensive J-K 16 mm optical printer using a Bolex camera. An optical printer is a device consisting of one or more film projectors mechanically linked to a movie camera. It allows filmmakers to re-photograph one or more strips of film. The optical printer is used for making special effects for motion pictures, or for copying and restoring old film material. Common optical effects include fade outs and fade ins, dissolves, slow motion, fast motion, and matte work. More complicated work can involve dozens of elements, all combined into a single scene. History The first, simple optical printers were constructed early in the 1920s. Linwood G. Dunn expanded the concept in the 1930s, and during World War II he was commissioned by the United States armed forces' photographic units to design an optical printer that could be ordered as a stock item like a camera. Dunn created an optical printer that he used in King Kong, eliminating the necessity to create optical effects in the camera. Development continued well into the 1980s, when the printers were now controlled using minicomputers. Prime examples of optical printing work include the matte work in Star Wars (1977), Robocop (1987) and The Addams Family (1991). The film Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988) involved over 1,000 shots that required optical printers, due to the film's combination of live action and cartoon elements. Some shots, such as those featuring Jessica Rabbit, involved as many as thirty layers of film. In the late 1980s, digital compositing began to supplant optical effects. By the mid-nineties, computer graphics had evolved to rival and surpass what was possible with optical printers, and many now consider optical printing all but obsolete. Improvements in film scanners and recorders allow for a complete feature film to be processed by computers, have special effects applied, and then be processed back to film. Today, optical printing is mostly used as an artistic tool by experimental film makers, for educational purposes, or for photochemical (as opposed to digital) film restoration. As a technique, it is particularly useful for making copies of hand painted or physically manipulated film. Artifacts As in any analog process, every re-printing degrades the picture, just like a photocopy of a photocopy. Properly performed contact printing generally creates less degradation provided that the contact between the negative and the print film is perfect. Optical printing can emphasize the grain structure and any imperfections in the negative.Couzin, Dennis (1988) \\"Contact and Optical Printing Sharpness, Some Ultimate Comparisons\\", Image Technology (Journal of the BKSTS), August 1988, pp=282‚Äì284. (PDF) Also, since a new, different piece of film was exposed and printed, matching the exact colors of the original was a problem. Often the printer work was limited to only the parts of a dissolve needing the effect. The original footage was spliced mid-shot with the optically-printed portion, often resulting in an obvious change in image quality when the transition occurs. Other problematic artifacts depend on the effect attempted, most often alignment inaccuracies in matte work. For this reason, shots intended to be manipulated via optical printer were often shot on larger film formats than the rest of the project. Otherwise obsolete formats, such as VistaVision, remained in use for many years after they had been abandoned for the conventional shooting of scenes because their larger frame size provided greater clarity, reduced grain size when reprinted and any alignment problems were not as conspicuous. Restoration printing Optical printers have often been used in the recovery of older, damaged film stock. This includes the 1989 restoration of Intolerance (1916). Scratches, abrasions, cinch marks caused by rewinding a film too tightly, and other blemishes are a common problem with films that are candidates for restoration. Most of these scratches are in the back side of the film in the transparent substrate that forms the film base, rather than in the photographic emulsion on the front that holds the film's actual image. In the normal process of duplicating a film in an optical printer, collimated light passes through the film base on its way to illuminate the emulsion. Any scratches, abrasions, etc., in the film base cause the light to bend such that the duplicated film ends up with bright or dark (depending on whether copying from a negative or positive original) copies of the scratches. This bending of the light is being caused by the difference in the refraction index of the substrate and the air. If these scratches and abrasions can be prevented from being captured on the new print, it eliminates one entire area of restoration work. Three methods address this problem. First, one can simply enlarge the portion of the film not damaged. This mainly has application where the damage is confined to the edges. The second method is wet-gate printing. The \\"gate\\" in a projector is the apparatus that holds the film in place as each frame is shown. A wet gate is filled with a fluid that coats the film as it is fed through, constantly replenishing the fluid as needed. Wet gate printing eliminates the refraction itself by filling in the gouges in the substrate with a fluid such as perchloroethene that shares approximately the same refractive index as the substrate. With the fluid temporarily displacing the air in the scratches and abrasions, refraction simply no longer occurs, so the defects are not reflected on the new copy. The light used is fully collimated, as with standard optical printing, and the film is undamaged by the process. This method does not work if the scratches on the emulsion side are deep enough to have removed some of the silver or dye image in the original film. The third method involves inserting a diffusion filter in the path from the collimated light source to the film. It can eliminate the projection of small defects on the back side of the film onto the new copy because the light, rather than arriving at the back of the film in perfect parallel lines, instead enters the scratch from several directions. It is therefore still diffuse when it exits, ensuring an image of the scratch will not show up as strongly on the new print. (Only the desired image on the surface of the emulsion ends up being captured in focus.) This method results in the most finely-focused capture of the original.

He was considered the foremost steel and plant engineer and designer of his time, especially in regard to applying research to modern steel manufacturing processes. Biography Born in Lakeville, Connecticut in 1832, Holley attended Brown University. During his early 20s, Holley was a close friend of Zerah Colburn, the well-known locomotive engineer and journalist/publisher. In 1857, the two visited Britain and France and compiled a report for the presidents of American railroads, The Permanent Way published in 1858. In 1860, the two traveled together on the maiden voyage of Isambard Kingdom Brunel's Great Eastern. Holley's most famous book, A treatise on ordnance and armor published in 1865, followed a visit he made to Britain in 1863 when he again met Zerah Colburn. Holley was a creative inventor, who received 15 patents in the US. Ten of those fifteen were for improvements in the Bessemer process, of which he had purchased the rights in England in 1863 and brought to the United States. He soon designed and built Bessemer plants in Troy, New York, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and Braddock, Pennsylvania. He planned or was consulted on a dozen others. Holley has been president of the American Institute of Mining Engineers, and vice-president of the American Society of Civil Engineers. In 1880 Holley chaired the first meeting of the founders of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) in the offices of the American Machinist on 16 February and afterwards served as vice- president of the society. In 1882 he was awarded the Bessemer Gold Medal of the British Iron and Steel Institute for his sevices to the industry. Legacy Bust of Alexander Lyman Holley in Washington Square Park. The Holley medal is given out by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers in his honor. He received many honors, including being made an honorary member of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers in 1892; and in 1890 a monument was unveiled in Washington Square Park, New York bearing a bust of him.

Content  The story of how King Abgar and Jesus had corresponded was first recounted in the 4th century by the church historian Eusebius of Caesarea in his Ecclesiastical History (i.13 and iii.1) and it was retold in elaborated form by Ephrem the Syrian.  Purpose  Helmut Koester regards the development of tradition of Thaddaeus' activity in Edessa as part of an effort to build the authority of the orthodox or Palutian faction in Syria against the Manicheans and gnostics, who had an older and stronger presence in the area and traced their lineage to Thomas the Apostle. He considers the Palutian faction to have come to Edessa around and only become significant in the fourth century.

The season began in early July with a hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico and ended in late November with a slow-moving tropical storm over the Lesser Antilles. Of the season's seven documented systems, six are believed to have become hurricanes, and two intensified into major hurricanes‚Äîthe equivalence of Category 3 or greater on the modern-day Saffir‚ÄìSimpson scale. All but one of the systems directly affected land to some degree; Hurricane \\"Six\\" remained over open water and only posed a threat to shipping lanes. In addition, a possible storm was identified off the coast of North Carolina on August 28‚Äì29, but modern reanalysis efforts have found insufficient evidence to classify it as a tropical cyclone. Tropical systems in the 1896 season killed at least 286 people and inflicted more than $10 million (1896 USD) in damage. The first hurricane made landfall in the Florida Panhandle on July 7, causing wind damage and coastal flooding in Pensacola, and destroying boats at port. No activity was observed until late August when a hurricane triggered widespread river flooding in Puerto Rico. After moving north, this storm struck eastern New England. Hurricane \\"Three\\" avoided land, but its outer periphery generated gusty winds in the Outer Banks of North Carolina. On September 29, fast-moving Hurricane \\"Four\\" became one of the costliest United States hurricanes on record at the time after swamping Florida's Cedar Keys with a large storm surge and subsequently causing extensive devastation in the eastern United States. The hurricane caused 202 deaths and more than $9 million in damage across eight states, plus Washington, D.C. and the Great Lakes. About two weeks later, Hurricane \\"Five\\" roughly paralleled the U.S. East Coast, causing substantial coastal flooding and destruction of beachfront property. Little is known about the season's sixth hurricane which never affected land. Torrential rainfall associated with the final tropical storm of the season triggered deadly flooding on Montserrat, where nearly 50 people drowned and many more lost their homes. __TOC__ Timeline ImageSize = width:800 height:200 PlotArea = top:10 bottom:80 right:20 left:20 Legend = columns:3 left:30 top:58 columnwidth:270 AlignBars = early DateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy Period = from:01/07/1896 till:01/01/1897 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal ScaleMinor = grid:black unit:month increment:1 start:01/07/1896 Colors = id:canvas value:gray(0.88) id:GP value:red id:TD value:rgb(0.38,0.73,1) legend:Tropical_Depression_=_<39_mph_(0‚Äì62_km/h) id:TS value:rgb(0,0.98,0.96) legend:Tropical_Storm_=_39‚Äì73_mph_(63‚Äì117 km/h) id:C1 value:rgb(1,1,0.80) legend:Category_1_=_74‚Äì95_mph_(118‚Äì153_km/h) id:C2 value:rgb(1,0.91,0.46) legend:Category_2_=_96‚Äì110_mph_(154‚Äì177_km/h) id:C3 value:rgb(1,0.76,0.25) legend:Category_3_=_111‚Äì130_mph_(178‚Äì209_km/h) id:C4 value:rgb(1,0.56,0.13) legend:Category_4_=_131‚Äì156_mph_(210‚Äì251_km/h) id:C5 value:rgb(1,0.38,0.38) legend:Category_5_=_‚â•157_mph_(‚â•252_km/h) Backgroundcolors = canvas:canvas BarData = barset:Hurricane bar:Month PlotData= barset:Hurricane width:10 align:left fontsize:S shift:(4,-4) anchor:till from:04/07/1896 till:09/07/1896 color:C2 text:\\"One (C2)\\" from:30/08/1896 till:10/09/1896 color:C3 text:\\"Two (C3)\\" from:18/09/1896 till:28/09/1896 color:C2 text:\\"Three (C2)\\" from:22/09/1896 till:30/09/1896 color:C3 text:\\"Four (C3)\\" from:07/10/1896 till:13/10/1896 color:C2 text:\\"Five (C2)\\" from:26/10/1896 till:09/11/1896 color:C2 text:\\"Six (C2)\\" from:27/11/1896 till:29/11/1896 color:TS text:\\"Seven (TS)\\" bar:Month width:5 align:center fontsize:S shift:(0,-20) anchor:middle color:canvas from:01/07/1896 till:01/08/1896 text:July from:01/08/1896 till:01/09/1896 text:August from:01/09/1896 till:01/10/1896 text:September from:01/10/1896 till:01/11/1896 text:October from:01/11/1896 till:01/12/1896 text:November from:01/12/1896 till:01/01/1897 text:December TextData = pos:(570,30) text:\\"(From the\\" pos:(617,30) text:\\"Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale)\\" Systems =Hurricane One= The first documented tropical cyclone of the 1896 season has unclear origins. Although its official track in the National Hurricane Center's Atlantic hurricane database shows a northwestward path over Cuba, contemporary United States Weather Bureau maps indicated formation in the western Gulf of Mexico, and news reports discussed an eastward motion of the storm. Additionally, no severe weather was observed in Cuba during the month of July. In any event, the storm likely intensified into a hurricane on July 5, and around midday on July 7, it made landfall on the Florida Panhandle east of Pensacola, at Category 2 intensity. Upon moving ashore, the hurricane produced powerful winds as high as . The storm rapidly weakened as it moved inland, and after tracking north for five days, its remnants dissipated near Baffin Bay on July 12. Widespread damage was reported in Pensacola and along the coast, with watercraft suffering the greatest losses. In the city's harbor, the storm sank nine fishing boats, damaged two barques and a brig, and wrecked numerous smaller vessels. The winds damaged chimneys, signs, awnings, overhead wires, and some buildings throughout the city. About 35 house were unroofed, along with several stores, a hotel, and a church. Fallen trees rendered streets impassable, and railroads near the shore were washed out. Total damage in the city was estimated at $100,000. As the storm moved inland, gusty winds and heavy rainfall extended into parts of Alabama, Georgia, the Carolinas, and southern Virginia. Precipitation peaked at in Greenwood, South Carolina. On the morning of July 8, rainbands on the storm's eastern side spawned a tornado in Halifax County, North Carolina, that killed one person and destroyed several houses. Several more tornadoes developed in Virginia later in the day, causing five injuries and scattered damage.Barnes, p. 77 =Hurricane Two= Hurricane San Ram√≥n of 1896 On August 30, a tropical storm materialized east of the Lesser Antilles, on a northwestward course. The next night, it made landfall on the southern coast of Puerto Rico as a Category 2 hurricane, accompanied by severe rain and wind. The storm passed just north of Hispaniola and Cuba over the next several days, delivering tropical storm-force winds to the islands. On the evening of September 6, while near the Bahamas, a steamship crossed the center of the hurricane and recorded a barometric pressure of . This corresponds to maximum sustained winds of 115 mph (185 km/h), or a Category 3 major hurricane, which represents storm's peak intensity. The ship suffered extensive damage and lost one crew member when he fell overboard. Tracking generally northward, the storm weakened to minimal hurricane intensity before making landfall over eastern Massachusetts on September 10, with maximum sustained winds extending to a radius of from the center. Sustained hurricane-force winds were observed in both Rhode Island and Massachusetts as the storm moved ashore. The system transitioned into an extratropical cyclone shortly thereafter. Several rivers in Puerto Rico overflowed, leading to extensive flooding. Five homes were destroyed along the coast of Juana D√≠az. Later, the storm generated damaging winds along the Northeastern United States coast from New Jersey to eastern New England, wreaking havoc on beachfront property and small craft. High storm tides inundated streets, wharves, and cellars along the coast, while farther inland, high winds damaged crops and stripped orchards of their fruit. Wind gusts reached at Point Judith, Rhode Island, where five vessels were destroyed, and on Block Island. In Providence, the storm brought down communications wires and lodged numerous yachts against the coast. To the north, four sloops sank in Dorchester Bay. In Boston, the storm caused minor wind damage, mostly limited to chimneys, fences, and signs. On September 14, a stricken Italian barque called the Monte Tabor grounded out on a sandbar off Cape Cod after encountering the hurricane several days earlier. Seven of the ship's crew members made it safely to shore, but inexplicably, three others‚Äîincluding the captain‚Äîcommitted suicide upon running aground.Snow, pp. 237‚Äì238 =Hurricane Three= An unusually large storm formed east of the Lesser Antilles by September 18. It tracked northwestward, and on September 22, falling air pressure was observed at Havana, Cuba, some southwest of the storm's center. Several ships encountered the hurricane in the Gulf Stream on September 23, with one of them suffering damage to her sails. The hurricane recurved to the northeast far from the East Coast of the United States, but still produced northeasterly wind gusts as high as at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, and at Cape Hatteras, roughly northwest of the hurricane. Although its intensity and path are not certain, the Atlantic hurricane database tracks the storm until dissipation south of Iceland on September 28. =Hurricane Four= The Cedar Keys Hurricane of 1896 The most destructive tropical cyclone of the season, and one of the costliest hurricanes ever to strike the United States at the time,Schwartz, p. 101 passed through the Leeward Islands as a tropical storm on September 22, and moved westward Through Caribbean Sea south of Hisponiola and Jamaica. Intensifying into a Category 3 major hurricane, the storm moved through the Yucat√°n Channel on September 28, then accelerated toward the north-northeast. In the early morning on September 29, the hurricane struck Florida's Cedar Keys and moved inland across Levy County. The small but intense hurricane sped northward through northern Florida and southern Georgia; its rapid movement allowed it to maintain much of its severity over land.Barnes, p. 78 Extremely high winds accompanied the hurricane to the east of its track through the Mid-Atlantic states, and a band of heavy rain fell to its west from northern North Carolina to southern Pennsylvania. While becoming extratropical, the storm struck Washington, D.C., late on September 29, and after crossing central Pennsylvania, it dissipated near the Southern Tier of New York. Its remnants merged with another low pressure area over the Great Lakes. The Cedar Keys were struck by a devastating storm surge that undermined buildings, washed out the connecting railroad to the mainland, and fully submerged the smaller, outlying islands where 31 people were killed.Oickle, pp. 59‚Äì61 Strong winds destroyed many of the red cedar trees that played an important role in the economy of the region,Oickle, p. 97 and several cedar mills were severely damaged or destroyed.Oickle, p. 53 In interior Florida, the hurricane devastated many communities, leaving thousands of people homeless.Oickle, p. 65 Few homes or businesses were left standing in the hardest-hit areas. In northern Florida and southern Georgia, the hurricane razed millions of acres of pine forests, which crippled the local turpentine industry.Oickle, p. 66 In Savannah, Georgia, a 45-minute onslaught of fierce winds unroofed thousands of structures and left parks in a state of disarray. Damage to shipping and shoreline settlements in the Sea Islands was extensive. As the hurricane continued northward, cities and agricultural districts alike suffered extensive damage in Virginia. Flash flooding in the Shenandoah Valley culminated in the failure of an earthen dam upstream from Staunton, unleashing a torrent of water that swept homes from their foundations and ravaged the town's business district.Schwartz, p. 103 In Washington, D.C., thousands of trees were uprooted or snapped, communications were severed, and localized streaks of violent gusts damaged many public and private buildings. Many trees, some of historical significance, were blown down on the White House grounds. In Pennsylvania, flooding rains and powerful wind gusts produced widespread destruction, washing out railroads in western areas while demolishing hundreds of barns in and around Lancaster County. The storm demolished a bridge over the Susquehanna River,Schwartz, p. 105 while the Gettysburg Battlefield lost hundreds of trees, a few of which landed on historical monuments. Damaging winds brought down trees and powerlines throughout the Northeastern United States, and the hurricane's extratropical remnants wrought havoc on shipping in the Great Lakes. Along the storm's path, it caused at least 202 deaths, and wrought more than $9.6 million in damage. =Hurricane Five= The East Coast Hurricane of 1896 This cyclone was first noted in the southern Gulf of Mexico as a weak tropical storm on October 7. It tracked toward the east-northeast and made landfall in a sparsely populated region of Southwest Florida around 00:02 UTC on October 9. After crossing the Florida Peninsula, it turned more northeastward and gradually intensified. The unusually slow-moving hurricane attained its peak intensity early on October 11, with estimated maximum sustained winds of 100 mph (155 km/h). Shortly thereafter, it made its closest approach to Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, passing roughly to the southeast. For several days, the hurricane brushed the coast from Virginia to southern New England with hurricane-force wind gusts. The storm became extratropical by 00:00 UTC on October 14, and struck the coast of central Nova Scotia before dissipating on October 16. The storm had generally minor effects in Florida, mostly limited to coastal flooding in northeastern portions of the state. The Mid-Atlantic coastline experienced flooding storm tides that inundated and greatly eroded Cobb's Island, part of the Virginia Barrier Islands. Hotels and cottages there were extensively damaged. The storm claimed about of Cobb's Island, reducing its size by two- thirds; subsequently, the inhabitants abandoned the island and its use as a resort ended. Along the Jersey Shore, low-lying railroads were flooded, boardwalks were destroyed, and many beach houses sustained damage. The hurricane did $200,000 in damage to coastal installations on New York's Coney Island. To the north, wind gusts as high as affected eastern New England, where shipping interests were heavily impacted by the storm. Three sailors died when a schooner went aground along the coast of Delaware,Schwartz, p. 108 and another was tossed overboard while battling rough seas offshore. Overall damage amounted to $500,000. =Hurricane Six= Little is known about the sixth storm of the season, which was first observed near on October 17, and intensified into a moderate hurricane as it roamed the open Atlantic for two weeks. It was last noted near on November 9. On October 28, a ship was damaged by a severe squall or possible tornado, accompanied by frequent thunder and lightning, about to the northwest of the storm's estimated track. This incident may have been related to the hurricane if it were exceptionally large, and represents the only extant observation of the storm that modern reanalysis efforts were able to uncover. =Tropical Storm Seven= The final documented system of 1896 formed over the far southern Windward Islands on November 27. As the storm slowly tracked northward, torrential rainfall and strong winds overspread Trinidad, Saint Vincent, and Barbados. Several days of rainfall over Montserrat culminated in a \\"cloud burst\\" late on November 28, with improving conditions reported by the next morning. The storm remained below hurricane intensity and was last noted on November 29, just over northeast of Anguilla. In the affected islands, heavy precipitation gave rise to flash flooding along mountain streams and in valleys, destroying crops and property. Cotton, coffee, and sugar plantations sustained significant damage. On Montserrat, one plantation recorded at least of rain in 21 hours, though the rain gauge overflowed between each of the three observations, preventing an accurate total from being obtained. It was speculated that several feet of rain may have locally fallen on certain hillsides, as evidenced by landslides that swept away trees, boulders, and large volumes of earth. Thirty-one people drowned in Plymouth after their homes were swept into the sea. Roadways were washed out in many places and the torrents reportedly washed out all but one bridge on the island. In total, 46 people drowned in the floods, while many others were left homeless. Secretary of State for the Colonies Joseph Chamberlain estimated monetary damage at ¬£10,000 ($49,000). The destruction was compounded by a series of earthquakes that began during the storm's passage. A ship called the ship Grecian, bound from Trinidad to London, England, grounded out on a rocky section of Montserrat's coastline. Twenty- nine out of the 30 crew members died in the wreck; the sole survivor was the first mate, who reached solid ground by clutching to a piece of floating debris, and walking inland several miles.

He was responsible for the destruction of the Dwarkadhish TempleDwarkadhish temple in Dwarka, Gujarat, one of the Char Dhams considered sacred by Hindus.https://www.livemint.com/mint-lounge/features/the-poison-sultan-of- gujarat-11574998816067.htmlhttps://devbhumidwarka.nic.in/history/ Names His full name was Abu'l Fath Nasir-ud-Din Mahmud Shah I. He was born Fat'h Khan or Fateh Khan. He titled himself, Sult√¢n al-Barr, Sult√¢n al-Bahr, Sultan of the Land, Sultan of the Sea. Of the origin of Mahm√∫d's surname Begra or Begarha, two explanations are given in Bird‚Äôs History of Gujar√°t (p. 202) and MirƒÉt-i-Ahmedi (Persian Text, pp. 74): # From his mustachios being large and twisted like a bullock's horn, such a bullock being called Begado. # That the word comes from the Gujar√°ti be, two, and gadh, a fort, the people giving him this title in honour of his capture of two forts; Junagadh of Girnar (1472) and Pavagadh of Champaner (1484). Early life On the death of Kutb-ud-d√≠n Ahmad Shah II, the nobles raised to the throne his uncle D√°√∫d Khan, son of Ahmad Shah I. But as D√°√∫d appointed low-born men to high offices and committed improper acts. Within a short period of seven or twenty-seven days, he was deposed, and in 1459 his half-brother Fateh Kh√°n, the son of Muhammad Shah II by B√≠bi Mughli, a daughter of J√°m J√∫na of Samma dynasty ruling from Thatta in Sindh; was seated on the throne at the age of little more than thirteen with the title of Mahm√∫d Sh√°h I. The close connection of Fateh Kh√°n with the saintly Sh√°h √Ålam is frequently mentioned by with Gujar√°t chroniclers. According to the MirƒÉt-i-Sikandari (Persian Text, 66‚Äì70) of his two daughters J√°m J√∫na intended B√≠bi Mughli the more beautiful for the Saint and B√≠bi Mirghi the less comely for the Sult√°n. By bribing the J√°m's envoys the king secured the prettier sister. The enraged Saint was consoled by his father who said: My son, to you will come both the cow and the calf. After Muhammad Shah II's death, fear of Kutb-ud-d√≠n Ahmad Shah II's designs against the young Fateh Kh√°n forced B√≠bi Mughli to seek safety with her sister, and on her sister's death she married the Saint. Kutb-ud-d√≠n made several attempts to seize Fateh Kh√°n. But by the power of the Saint when Kutb-ud-d√≠n attempted to seize him, Fateh Kh√°n in body as well as in dress became a girl. According to one account Kutb-ud-d√≠n met his death in an attempt to carry off Fateh Kh√°n. As he rode a mad camel, the king struck at the phantom, and his sword cleaving the air gashed his knee. This was the Saint's sword, which against his will, for he knew it would be the death of the king, Kutb-ud-d√≠n forced Sh√°h √Ålam to bind round him before the battle of Kapadvanj against Mahmud Khilji of Malwa Sultanate. Reign =Early years= Gate of Bhadra Fort Soon his uncle D√°√∫d Khan died. Shortly after certain of the nobles including Seiful Mulk, Kab√≠r- ud-d√≠n Sult√°ni surnamed Akd-ul-Mulk, Burh√°n-ul-Mulk and His√°m-ul-Mulk represented to the Sult√°n that the minister Sha√¢b√°n Im√°d-ul-Mulk contemplated treason and wished to set his son on the throne. Having seized and imprisoned the minister in the Bhadra Fort and set five hundred of their trusted retainers as guards over him, the rebels retired to their homes. At nightfall Abdull√°h, the chief of the elephant stables, going to the young Sult√°n represented to him that the nobles who had imprisoned Im√°d-ul-Mulk were the real traitors and had determined to place Hab√≠b Kh√°n, an uncle of the Sult√°n's, on the throne. The Sult√°n consulting his mother and some of his faithful friends ordered Abdull√°h at daybreak to equip all his elephants in full armour and draw them up in the square before the Bhadra. He then seated himself on the throne and in a voice of feigned anger ordered one of the courtiers to bring out Sha√¢b√°n Im√°d-ul-Mulk, that he might wreak his vengeance upon him. As these orders were not obeyed the Sult√°n rose, and walking up the Bhadra called: ‚ÄúBring out Sha√¢b√°n!‚Äù The guards brought forth Im√°d-ul-Mulk, and the Sult√°n ordered his fetters to be broken. Some of the nobles‚Äô retainers made their submission to the Sult√°n, others fled and hid themselves. In the morning, hearing what had happened, the refractory nobles marched against the Sult√°n. Many advised the Sult√°n to cross the Sabarmati river by the postern gate and retire from the city, and, after collecting an army, to march against the nobles. Giving no ear to these counsels the young Sult√°n ordered Abdull√°h to charge the advancing nobles with his six hundred elephants. The charge dispersed the malcontents who fled and either hid themselves in the city or betook themselves to the country. Some were killed, some were trampled by the Sult√°n's orders under the elephants‚Äô feet, and one was pardoned. In 1461 or 1462, according to Farishtah, Nizam Shah Bahmani (r. 1461‚Äì1463), the sultan of the Bahmani Sultanate in Deccan, whose country had been invaded by Sult√°n Mahmud Khilji of Malwa Sultanate, applied for help to the Gujar√°t king. Mahm√∫d Sh√°h at once started to Niz√°m Sh√°h's aid, and on his way receiving another equally pressing letter from the Deccan sovereign, and being joined by the B√°hmani general Khw√°j√°h Jeh√°n G√°w√°n, he pushed on with all speed by way of Burhanpur. When Sult√°n Mahm√∫d Khilji heard of his approach, he retired to his own country by way of Gondwana, from thirst and from the attacks of the Gonds, losing 5000 to 6000 men. The king of Gujar√°t, after receiving the thanks of the Deccan sovereign, returned to his own dominions. In 1462, Sult√°n Mahm√∫d Khilji made another incursion into the Deccan at the head of 90,000 horse, plundering and laying waste the country as far as Daulatabad. Again the Deccan sovereign applied for help to Mahm√∫d Sh√°h, and on hearing of Mahm√∫d's advance the M√°lwa Sult√°n retired a second time to his own dominions. Mahm√∫d Sh√°h wrote to the M√°lwa Sult√°n to desist from harassing the Deccan, threatening, in case of refusal, to march at once upon Mandu. His next expedition was against the pirate zam√≠nd√°rs of the hill fort of Barur and the bandar of D√ªn or Dahanu, whose fort he took, and after imposing an annual tribute allowed the chief to continue to hold his hundred villages. =Junagadh (Girnar)= Jama Masjid of Uparkot at Junagadh was built by Begada Mahm√∫d Sh√°h next turned his thoughts to the conquest of the mountain citadel, Uparkot, of Girnar hill near Junagadh in Sorath (now in Saurashtra region of Gujarat). In 1467, he made an attack on the fort of Jun√°ga·∏çh, and receiving the submission of Ra Mandalika III, the Chudasama ruler, returned to his capital. In the following year, hearing that the Jun√°ga·∏çh chief continued to visit his idol temple in state with a golden umbrella and other ensigns of royalty, Mahm√∫d despatched an army to Jun√°ga·∏çh, and the chief sent the obnoxious umbrella to the king, accompanied by fitting presents. In 1469, Mahm√∫d once more sent an army to ravage Sorath, with the intention of finally conquering both Jun√°ga·∏çh and Girn√°r. While Mahm√∫d was on the march the R√° Mandalika suddenly joined him, and asking why the Sult√°n was so bent on his destruction when he had committed no fault, agreed to do whatever Mahm√∫d might command. The king replied there is no fault like infidelity, and ordered the R√° to embrace Islam. The chief, now thoroughly alarmed, fled by night and made his way into Girn√°r. In 1472‚Äì73, after a siege of nearly two years, forced by the failure of his stores, he quitted the fort and handing the keys to the king, converted to Islam. Though the R√°'s life was spared, Sorath from this date became a crown possession, and was governed by an officer appointed by the king and stationed at Jun√°ga·∏çh. At the close of the war, in 1479, Mahm√∫d Sh√°h repaired the fort Jeh√°npan√°h, the present outer or town wall of Jun√°ga·∏çh, and, charmed with the beauty of the neighbourhood, settled sayads and learned men at Jun√°ga·∏çh and other towns in Sorath. He induced the nobles to build houses, himself raised a palace and made the new city his capital under the name of Mustaf√°bad and enforced his claims as overlord on all the neighbouring chiefs. In the times of Ahmad Shah I, these chieftains, including even the Jun√°ga·∏çh R√° himself, had paid tribute. But Mahm√∫d established rule so firmly that the duty of collecting the tribute was entrusted to an officer permanently settled in the country. The author of the MirƒÉt-i-Sikandari dilates on the dense woods round Jun√°ga·∏çh, full of mango, r√°en, j√°mbu, g√∫lar, √°mli, and √°onla trees (Mangifera indica, Mimusops hexandra, Eugenia jambolana, Ficus glomerata, Tamarindus indica, and Emblica officinalis.), and notes that this forest tract was inhabited by Kh√°nts. In 1480, when Mahm√∫d Sh√°h was at Jun√°ga·∏çh, Khud√°wand Kh√°n and others, who were weary of the king's constant warfare, incited his eldest son √Åhmed Khan to assume royal power. But Im√°d-ul-Mulk, by refusing to join, upset their plans, and on the king's return the conspiracy was stamped out. =Champaner (Pavagadh)= Bhammariyo Kuvo In 1479, Mahm√∫d Sh√°h sent an army to ravage Champaner then held by Khichi Chauhan Rajputs which titled themselves as Raval. About this time, hearing that the neighbourhood was infested with robbers, he founded the city of Mehm√∫d√°b√°d (now Mahemdavad) on the banks of the Vatrak river, about eighteen miles south of √Åhmed√°b√°d. Several monuments in Mahemdavad are credited to him including Bhammariyo Kuvo, a well; Chanda- Suraj No Mehal, a palace and Roza-Rozi. In 1482 there was a partial famine in Gujar√°t, and the Ch√°mp√°ner country being exempt from scarcity the commandant of Mor√°mli or Ras√∫l√°b√°d, a post in the G√°ekw√°r's S√°onli district on the Ch√°mp√°ner frontier, made several forays across the border. In return the chief attacked the commandant and defeated him, killing most of his men and capturing two elephants and several horses. On hearing this Mahm√∫d Sh√°h set out for Baroda (now Vadodara) with a powerful army. When Mahm√∫d reached Baroda the R√°val of Ch√°mp√°ner, becoming alarmed, sent ambassadors and sued for forgiveness. The king rejected his overtures, saying: \\"Except the sword and the dagger no message shall pass between me and you.\\" The R√°val made preparations for a determined resistance, and sent messengers to summon Ghi√°s- ud-d√≠n Khilji of M√°lwa Sultanate to his aid. To prevent this junction Mahm√∫d Sh√°h entrusted the siege to his nobles and marched to Dahod, on which Sult√°n Ghi√°s-ud-d√≠n withdrew to M√°ndu. On his return from Dahod, the Sult√°n began building a J√°ma Mosque at Ch√°mp√°ner to show that he would not leave the place till he had taken the hill-fort of Pavagadh. After the siege had lasted more than twenty months (April 1483‚ÄìDecember 1484), the Mahmud's soldiers noticed that for an hour or two in the morning most of the soldiers of Raval were off duty bathing and dressing. A morning assault was planned and the first gate carried. Then Malik Ay√°z Sult√°ni finding a practicable breach passed through with some of his men and took the great gate. The R√°val and his R√°jputs rushed out in a fierce but unavailing charge. The R√°val and his minister D√∫ngarshi fell wounded into the conqueror's hands, and, on refusing to embrace Isl√°m, were put to death. Pavagadh was conquered on 21 November 1484. The R√°val's son, who was entrusted to Seif-ul-Mulk, and converted to Islam, afterwards, in the reign of Muzaffar Sh√°h (1523‚Äì1526), was ennobled by the title of Niz√°m-ul- Mulk. On the capture of P√°v√°ga·∏çh, Mahm√∫d Sh√°h built a wall round the town of Ch√°mp√°ner, and made it his capital under the name of Muhammad√°b√°d. Under Mahm√∫d's orders the neighbourhood became stocked with mangoes, pomegranates, figs, grapes, sugarcane, plantains, oranges, custard apples, khirnis or r√°ens (Mimusops indica or hexandra), jackfruit, and cocoapalms, as well as with roses, chrysanthemums, jasmins, champ√°s, and sweet pandanus. A sandal grove near Ch√°mp√°ner is said to have had trees large enough to help his nobles to build their mansions. At the instance of the Sult√°n a Khur√°s√°ni beautified one of the gardens with fountains and cascades. A Gujar√°ti named H√°lur learning the principle improved on his master's design in a garden about four miles west of Ch√°mp√°ner, which in his honour still bears the name Halol. It took 23 years to build the town. The town finally succumbed to attacks from the Mughal Empire under Humayun in 1535. Jama Mosque, Champaner The magnificent Jama mosque of Champaner is considered as one of the finest architectural edifices in Gujarat. It is an imposing structure on a high plinth with two tall minarets 30 m tall, 172 pillars and seven mihrabs. The central dome, the placement of balconies and carved entrance gates with fine stone jalis. Other Champaner structures attributed to the Begada period are the Kevada Masjid, Citadel Jahanpanah, Shahar ki Masjid, Mandvi the customs house, Nagina Masjid, Bava Man's Masjid, Khajuri Masjid, Ek Minar Masjid, and the Lila Gumbaz. Champaner-Pavagadh Archaeological Park is now UNESCO World Heritage Site. =Last years= In 1494‚Äì95 Mahm√∫d went against Bah√°dur Kh√°n G√≠l√°ni, a vassal of the Bahmani Sultanate, who from Goa and Dabhol had harassed the Gujar√°t harbours. Gilani was earlier warned by attacking Mahim island (now in Mumbai) by 20 ships under Yakut the Abyssinian, the slave of Begada. This time he sent an army by land and 300 boats by sea to attack Dabhol under Malik Sarang Kivam-ul-Mulk. The Bahmani Sult√°n, fearing the consequences to himself, marched against Bah√°dur Kh√°n, and, capturing him alive, struck off his head, and sent it to the Gujar√°t monarch, who returned to his own country. In 1499‚Äì1500, hearing that N√°sir-ud-d√≠n of M√°lwa had killed his father Ghi√°s-ud- d√≠n and seated himself on the throne, the Sult√°n prepared to advance against him, but was appeased by N√°sir-ud-d√≠n's humble attitude. The next seven years passed without any warlike expedition. ;Battles with the Portuguese Cambay (now Khambhat) was an important port of the Gujarat Sultanate. It was an essential intermediary in east‚Äìwest trade, between the Red Sea, Egypt and Malacca. Gujaratis were important middlemen bringing spices from the Maluku Islands as well as silk from China, and then selling them to the Mamluks and Arabs. The Portuguese had entered India and were strengthening their presence in Arabian Sea. Mahmud Begada allied with the Kozhikkodu Samutiri (anglicised to Zamorin of Calicut) to defeat the Portuguese. He then asked his trade partners, the Egyptian Mamluk Sultanate of Cairo, for help. In 1508, near Daman, on his way to Chaul, Mahm√∫d heard of the victory gained in the Battle of Chaul over the Portuguese by the Gujar√°t squadron under Malik Ayyaz Sult√°ni, in concert with the Egyptian fleet of the Mamluks. In 1509, the Battle of Diu, a naval battle was fought near Diu port between the Portuguese Empire and a joint fleet of the Gujarat Sultanate under Malik Ayyaz, the Maml√ªk Burji Sultanate of Egypt, the Zamorin of Calicut with support of the Turkish feet of Ottoman Empire, the Republic of Venice and the Republic of Ragusa (Dubrovnik). The Portuguese won the battle and the event marks the start of European colonialism in Asia.Rogers, Clifford J. Readings on the Military Transformation of Early Modern Europe, San Francisco:Westview Press, 1995, pp. 299‚Äì333 at Angelfire.com ;Death From 1508, Mahm√∫d remained at his capital till his death in December 1511 at the age of sixty-six years and three months, after a reign of fifty-four years and one month. Mahm√∫d was buried at Sarkhej Roza near Ahmedabad and received the after-death title of Kh√∫d√°ig√°n-i-Hal√≠m or the Meek Lord. Immediately before his death Sult√°n Mahm√∫d was informed that Sh√°h Ism√°il Safawi of Persia had sent him a friendly embassy headed by Y√°dg√°r Beg Kazil-b√°sh. As the Kazil-b√°shes were known to be Shia, the Sult√°n, who was a staunch Sunni, prayed that he might not be forced to see a Shia's face during his last days. His prayer was heard. He died before the Persian embassy entered the city. During the last days of Sult√°n Mahm√∫d, Sayed Muhammad of Jaunpur, who claimed to be the Mahdi or Messiah, came from Jaunpur and lodged in T√°jkh√°n S√°l√°r's mosque near the Jamalpur gate of √Åhmed√°b√°d. His sermons drew crowds, and were so persuasive that he gained a large body of followers, who believed his eloquence to be due to h√°l or inspiration. Mahm√∫d's ministers persuaded him not to see the Jaunpur preacher. Administration Silver tanka coins of Mahmud Begada Copper coins of Mahmud Begada His religious ardour, his love of justice, his bravery, and his wise measures entitle Mahm√∫d to the highest place among the Gujar√°t kings. One of the measures which the MirƒÉt-i-Sikandari specially notices is his continuance of land grants to the son of the holder, and in cases where there was no male issue of half the grant to the daughter. His firm policy of never ousting the landholder except for proved oppression or exaction was productive of such prosperity that the revenue increased two, three and in some cases tenfold. The roads were safe from freebooters and trade was secure. A rule forbidding soldiers to borrow money at interest is favourably noticed. A special officer was appointed to make advances to needy soldiers with the power to recover from their pay in fixed instalments. Mahm√∫d also devoted much attention to the culture of fruit trees. In Mahm√∫d's reign an instance is mentioned of the form of compensation. Some merchants bringing horses and other goods for sale from Ir√°k and Khur√°s√°n were plundered in Sirohi limits. The king caused them to give in writing the price of their horses and stuffs, and paying them from his own treasury recovered the amount from the R√°ja of Sirohi. ;His nobles Mahm√∫d Begada's court was adorned by several pious and high-minded nobles. In life they vied with one another in generous acts; and after death, according to the Persian poet Urfi, they left their traces in the characters and carvings of stone walls and marble piles. First among these nobles the MirƒÉt-i-Sikandari (Persian Text, 132, 142) mentions D√°war-ul-Mulk, whose god-fearing administration made his estates so prosperous that they were coveted by princes of the blood. As Th√°nad√°r of Amron in north Kathiawad, he spread Isl√°m from Morbi to Bhuj, and after his death his fame as a spirit-ruling guardian drew hosts of sick and possessed to his shrine near Morbi. The second was Malik Ay√°z, governor of Diu, who built the strong fortress afterwards reconstructed by the Portuguese. He also built a tower on an under-water rock, and from the tower drew a massive iron chain across the mouth of the harbour. A substantial bridge over the creek, that runs through the island of Diu, was afterwards destroyed by the Portuguese. The third was Khud√°wand Kh√°n ƒÄl√≠m, the founder of ƒÄl√≠mpura a suburb to the south of √Åhmed√°b√°d, adorned with a mosque of sandstone and marble. He introduced the cultivation of melons figs and sugarcane into Gujar√°t from Bijapur. The fourth was Im√°d-ul-Mulk ƒÄsas who founded Isanpur, a suburb between Sh√°h √Ålam's suburb of Isl√°mpur and Vatva (all now in Ahmedabad), and planted along the road groves of khirnis and mangoes. The fifth was T√°jkh√°n S√°l√°r, so loved of his peers that after his death none of them would accept his title. The sixth was Malik S√°rang Kiw√°m- ul-Mulk, a R√°jput by birth, the founder of the suburb of Sarangpur and its mosque to the east of √Åhmed√°b√°d. The seventh and eighth were the Khur√°s√°ni brothers A√¢zam and Mo√¢zzam, who built a cistern, a mosque, and a their tomb between Vasna and Sarkhej. Family Besides Khal√≠l Kh√°n, who succeeded him, Mahm√∫d had three sons: Muhammad K√°la, √Åp√° Kh√°n, and √Åhmed Kh√°n. K√°la, son of R√°ni R√∫p Manjhri died during his father's lifetime as did his mother, who was buried in M√°nek Chowk in √Åhmed√°b√°d in the building known as the R√°ni's Haz√≠ra. The second son √Åp√° Kh√°n was caught trespassing in a noble's har√≠m, and was ordered by the Sult√°n to be poisoned. The third son was the √Åhmed Kh√°n whom Khud√°wand Kh√°n sought to raise to the throne during Sult√°n Mahm√∫d's lifetime. In culture Some European travellers circulated popular tales about him. One of these tales told that he was given mild poisons from his childhood which had made him poisonous and immune to poisons and those became the source for the English satirist Samuel Butler's seventeenth-century lines: \\"The Prince of Cambay's daily food/ Is asp and basilisk and toad\\". There are various other stories about his good appetite, some of which are noted by modern historians too. According to Satish Chandra, Mahmud used to eat lot of food during the day and Meat patties(Samosas) were kept at his bedside by his servants at night in case he feel hungry.

Henry Rossiter Worthington (December 17, 1817 ‚Äì December 17, 1880) was an American mechanical engineer, inventor, industrialist and founder of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers in 1880. Worthington had several inventions leading to the perfection of the direct steam pump (1845‚Äì55), patented the duplex steam pump (1859), and built the first duplex waterworks engine, widely adopted and used for more than 75 years. He established a pump manufacturing plant, New York City, in 1859. Biography Born in New York City, Worthington was the eldest child of Frances (Meadowcraft) and Asa Worthington, an engineer and owner of the \\"Hope Flour Mills\\" and a man prominent in public affairs. He was a descendant in the sixth generation of Nicholas Worthington, who emigrated from England about 1650 and settled in Saybrook, Connecticut. He founded the Henry R. Worthington Pump Works in 1845 in Brooklyn, and had a plant on Van Brunt Street, Red Hook, Brooklyn until 1904 when they moved their company to Harrison, NJ. . On 24 September 1839, Worthington married Laura I. Newton of Alexandria, Virginia, the daughter of Commodore John Thomas Newton of Alexandria, Virginia. Six children were born to them, four boys and two girls. Charles C., born in 1854, was the youngest and the only one of the children to become actively interested in the family pump business. At the time of his death, Worthington was survived by his widow, two sons, and two daughters.New York Times, post  Work  = Early interests = After being educated in the public schools of his native city, Worthington, who had shown early a decided bent for things mechanical, sought employment that enabled him to become a hydraulic engineer while still a very young man. He concentrated his attention on the problems of city water supply, became thoroughly familiar with steam engines and mechanical pumps, and engaged in experiments intended to improve these machines. Canal navigation interested him, too, and it was in this connection that he made his first invention. As early as 1840 he had an experimental steam canal boat in operation which was fairly successful except that when the boat was stopped it became necessary to resort to hand pump to keep the steam boiler supplied with water. To overcome this deficiency he invented an independent feeding pump which was automatic in its action and was controlled by the water level within the steam boiler (patent, September 7, 1840). = Pumping machinery = After pursuing his canal navigation experiments for four of five more years and obtaining a patent on February 2, 1844, for an improvement in the mode of propelling canal boats, he turned his attention again to pumping machinery and perfected a series of inventions between 1845 and 1855 which made him the first proposer and constructor of the direct steam pump (patent No. 13, 370). In 1859, after establishing a pump- manufacturing plant in New York, he perfected his duplex steam feed pump (patent No. 24,838) and in the following year built the first water-works engine of this kind. In the duplex system one engine actuated the steam valves of the other, and a pause of the pistons at the end of the stroke permitted the water-valves to seat themselves quietly and preserve a uniform water pressure. A distinct improvement on the Cornish engines used at the time, Worthington's pump embodied one of the most ingenious advances in engineering in the nineteenth century and its principle was widely applied. Because of their reliability and low operating cost, these pumps were greatly used thereafter in America for waterworks and for pumping oil through long pipe lines in the oil fields; they are still used (1936) for boiler feeding, tank and ballast pumping, and for hydraulic-press work. Worthington also originated a pumping engine that used no flywheel to carry the piston past the dead point at the end of the stroke. He devised, too, a number of instruments of precision, as well as machine tools which in themselves entitled him to a high place in his profession. In addition to directing his pump-manufacturing plant, which employed over two hundred men, he was president of the Nason Manufacturing Company in New York. He was a founder of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, acting as the Society's first vice-president, and was a member of other technical societies.

The FMCA was incorporated as a not-for-profit association under New York law in August 2006. The Alliance had a membership base of 20 leading global telecom operators, most of which were integrated telecom operators owning both fixed and mobile networks. The included vendor affiliation programme made the operators able to work closely with the associate members, who were all telecommunication vendors. Members The alliance was founded by six companies: British Telecom, NTT, Rogers Wireless, Brasil Telecom, Korea Telecom and Swisscom. The purpose of this alliance was to encourage seamless integration of mobile and fixed telephone services (Technological convergence). The member operators had a customer base of over 850 million customers and collaborated with member vendors towards accelerated development and availability of Convergence products and services in areas such as devices, access points and home gateways, roaming and innovative applications. Standards In order to accomplish its goals, the FMCA developed close relationships with leading Standards Development, Specification and Certification Organisations (SDO/Fora), including the Wi-Fi Alliance, Wireless Broadband Alliance, Home Gateway Initiative and 3GPP. The FMCA actively contributed towards the delivery of existing and emerging standards that were relevant to FMCA product and service requirements.

Traditionally, winemakers would reserve some of their best wine rather than sell it immediately, coining the term. In some countries the use of the term \\"reserve\\", \\"reserva\\" or \\"riserva\\" is regulated, but in many places it is not. Sometimes, reserve wine originates from the best vineyards, or the best barrels, making it more special. Additionally, reserve wines may be made in a style suited to longer aging periods. However, in regions where the use is not regulated the presence of the term \\"reserve\\" on a wine label may be nothing but a marketing strategy. Indeed, in the case of one of the largest-selling premium wines, Kendall-Jackson Chardonnay, every bottle produced is \\"Vintner's Reserve\\". To indicate a traditional reserve wine, Kendall-Jackson uses the term \\"Grand Reserve\\". Like the term \\"old vines\\", \\"reserve\\" traditionally indicates a wine that is special, or at least different in flavor or aging potential. The presence of a non-reserve bottling with a producer that also sells reserve wine makes it more likely that \\"reserve\\" is being used in its traditional sense. Partly because of the often vague meaning of \\"reserve\\", many wineries produce named cuv√©es instead. Typically these are reserve wines in the traditional meaning of the word. Reserva in Iberia Rioja Reserva In Portugal and Spain, reserva is a regulated term controlled by law, at least ensuring that reserve wines get some additional ageing. In practice it is very difficult to regulate quality, so the term primarily deals with ageing and alcoholic strength. In Portuguese and Spanish wines, the requirements varies between regions, but typically, when used on a label \\"Reserva\\" means that the wine was aged for at least three years in the cask and bottle, at least one of which must have been in the cask. Those that have been aged for five years (two in cask, three in bottle) or more are labelled '. Gran Reservas are intended to be made only in exceptional vintages, but this is up to the producer. In Portugal the term indicates that the wine has an alcohol level of at least 0.5 percent above the regional minimum, and that it was made from a rated vintage. Reserve wine in Champagne In the production of \\"non-vintage\\" Champagne, a certain amount of aged still wine is used for blending with still wine of the youngest vintage, before this blended base wine undergoes second fermentation in bottle to become sparkling Champagne. This aged still wine is called reserve wine, and this practice is meant to ensure that a certain Champagne house's non-vintage product has a consistent style over the years. Since the reserve wine is used in the production process, it is never bottled and sold as it is, but the proportion and age of the reserve wine is often seen as one of the indicators of the quality of a Champagne and the producer's level of ambition. Austrian DACs In the Austrian Districtus Austriae Controllatus (DAC) system, most DACs have an additional Reserve designation for a wine which has slightly more strict requirements. German Cabinet Before the 1971 German wine law, a term corresponding to reserve wine existed in kabinett, sometimes written as Kabinettwein. In 1971, the similar-sounding term Kabinett was instead introduced as the lowest level of the Pr√§dikatswein category, i.e., with a completely different meaning. Therefore, in the present German wine classification no legally defined term corresponding to reserve wine exists.

Voskhozhdeniye, literally - The Ascension) is a 1977 black- and-white Soviet drama film directed by Larisa Shepitko and made at Mosfilm. The movie was shot in January 1974 near Murom, Vladimir Oblast, Russia, in appalling winter conditions, as required by the script, based on the novel Sotnikov by Vasil Byka≈≠. It was Shepitko's last film before her death in a car accident in 1979. The film won the Golden Bear award at the 27th Berlin International Film Festival in 1977. It was also selected as the Soviet entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 50th Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.Margaret Herrick Library, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Plot During the Great Patriotic War (World War II), two Soviet partisans go to a Belarusian village in search of food. After taking a farm animal from the collaborationist headman (Sergei Yakovlev), they head back to their unit, but are spotted by a German patrol. After a protracted gunfight in the snow in which one of the Germans is killed, the two men get away, but Sotnikov (Boris Plotnikov) is shot in the leg. Rybak (Vladimir Gostyukhin) has to take him to the nearest shelter, the home of Demchikha (Lyudmila Polyakova), the mother of three young children. However, they are discovered and captured. The two men and a sobbing Demchikha are taken to the German headquarters. Sotnikov is interrogated first by local collaborator Portnov (Anatoli Solonitsyn), a former Soviet club-house director and children's choirmaster who became the local head of the Belarusian Auxiliary Police, loyal to the Germans. When Sotnikov refuses to answer Portnov's questions, he is brutally tortured by members of the collaborationist police, but gives up no information. However, Rybak tells as much as he thinks the police already know, hoping to live so he can escape later. Portnov offers him the job of policeman. The headman, now suspected of supporting the partisans, and Basya Meyer, the teen daughter of a Jewish shoemaker, are imprisoned in the same cellar for the night. The next morning, all are led out to be hanged. Rybak accepts Portnov's offer and the Germans let him join the police. Sotnikov and the others are executed. As he heads back to the camp with his new comrades, Rybak is vilified by the villagers. Realizing what he has done, he tries to hang himself in the outhouse with his belt, but fails. A fellow policeman calls for Rybak until Rybak opens the door. The policeman tells him that their commander wants him and leaves him alone in the courtyard. Rybak stares out the open door and begins to laugh and weep.

Production took place under an atmosphere of severe stress. Technical and organizational difficulties led to the necessity of calling an ambulance for the director's health. The release of the film was not any easier; the censors deleted critical scenes and Shepitko had to fight for every single one of them. This struggle was not always successful. Despite the fact that the film was one of the prize winners at the Venice Film Festival, the removed scenes were a terrible blow to Shepitko, who believed that changing an important moment leads to the loss of main ideas. For Shepitko it was a difficult time after the film's release. By her own admission, for a period of four months the director was in \\"a monstrous mental and physical exhaustion.\\" The realization of what was subsequently necessary came to her suddenly while she was recuperating at a Sochi sanatorium, but her creative plans were undermined by a disastrous fall, which resulted in a serious concussion and a spinal injury. For a few weeks Shepitko was confined to bed. The situation was also aggravated by the fact that she was pregnant, but she felt that during her pregnancy she came to understand the complexities of life more fully. Every day she was haunted by the possibility of death; reading the novel Sotnikov by Vasil B√Ωka≈≠ during this period helped Shepitko express this state on the silver screen. =Screenplay= For the most part the screenplay written by Yuri Klepikov follows the novel. Shepitko turned to Klepikov on the recommendation of her classmate Natalia Ryazantseva but he was already busy working on another script. Klepikov did not refuse the commission, but he asked to postpone working on The Ascent for a week. Shepitko urged him to start work immediately and a single telephone conversation with her convinced him to drop everything he was doing. Klepikov, by his own admission, \\"could not withstand the energy of the typhoon whose name was Larisa,\\" and started the task of revising the literary foundation which he later described as \\"a piping philosophical parable which combined the high spirit of man with his obvious desire to keep the body as a receptacle of the spirit.\\" The result of the work became a 70-page script that Shepitko then meticulously edited. Shepitko practised the \\"engineer's\\" approach: she did not tolerate uncertainty or haziness in work and did not rely on director's improvisation or creative inspiration. Every frame, every remark, every scene was carefully checked and planned in advance. According to Yuri Klepikov even \\"the fruitful spontaneity was due to the very environment of the shoot,\\" which was ensured by the carefully crafted script. When adapting the script from Sotnikov the main concern of the director was not to lose the deeper philosophical content of the story. While the literary work by B√Ωka≈≠ was full of sensual details like \\"icy cold\\", \\"famine\\", \\"danger\\", Shepitko strongly discouraged attempts to be satisfied with external action and demanded an \\"internal justification\\" of each movement, gesture and glance of the heroes. In order to express the spiritual states she often had to deviate from the literary basis. For example, in the finale of the original story Rybak decides to hang himself in the latrine but discovers that he forgot to ask for the belt back which had been taken by the policemen an evening before. Theoretically, the film could portray the absence of the belt, but then - according to the writers - the scene would be limited to the designation of the circumstances: informative but unimpressive denial in terms of the artistic sense. The authors \\"returned\\" the belt to Rybak but he was deprived of the ability to hang himself; implying that even death refuses a traitor. Their idea was to leave Rybak alone with the knowledge of his fall. The following long close-up of majestic nature signified the freedom which Rybak desperately desires and was intended to emphasize the utmost despair \\"of a person who lost himself.\\" Shepitko's husband Elem Klimov suggested the film's title. Long before, in 1963, a tradition was established between the future spouses that for a good idea they would receive ten roubles. When they just started dating, Klimov came up with the name for Shepitko's thesis film ‚Äì Heat. Shepitko and Klimov decided to continue this playful approach of rewarding each other but after all the years of their union Klimov alone received the ten rouble reward and only twice: for Heat and for The Ascent. =Beginning of production= The next step was the need for the script's approval from the State Committee for Cinematography. By that time Shepitko had already gained a reputation of an inconvenient director. In 1973, when she raised the topic of making the film, the answer from an official of the State Committee for Cinematography was a firm negative. The director did not spark a confrontation but she also did not offer any other projects. Throughout her directing career, Shepitko only started working on a film if she felt that \\"if she does not do it, then she dies.\\" For help in overcoming the resistance of the authorities and the State Political Directorate, Shepitko turned to Gemma Firsova with whom she had studied at VGIK. Firsova was an administrator of an association of military-patriotic films. She was affected much more by the script than by the novel and the day she met Shepitko, she went to the meet the Minister of Cinematography Philippe Ermash. In a conversation with Ermash's replacement (in her memoirs Firsova did not call Boris Pavlenok by his name), Firsova said that she took the script under her responsibility, with a lie that \\"everything will be fine with the State Political Directorate.\\" Ermash's replacement reacted skeptically to the pleas, and the subsequent process from script approval to acceptance of the film's actors was accompanied by considerable difficulties. The main accusation was that Shepitko allegedly made a religious parable with a mystical tone from the partisan story; this was considered an insurrection in the atheistic Soviet cinema. Shepitko retorted that she was not religious and that a story about betrayal was antediluvian. According to her, Judas and Jesus had always existed and that if the legend connected with people then this means that it was alive in every person. Officials met Schnittke's score with resistance and they ordered that the allusions to biblical texts be removed. From the moment she read the story Sotnikov, it took Larisa Shepitko four years to prepare and to obtain permits from the authorities to begin shooting the picture. =Casting= Shepitko decided to use unknown or little-known actors whose past roles would not cast a shadow on their characters in The Ascent. Because of this, she rejected Andrey Myagkov, who wanted to act in the picture. The same fate befell Nikolai Gubenko. Vladimir Vysotsky, who yearned to play Rybakov, also did not pass selection. At the time when the castings for The Ascent were taking place, Vysotsky was starring in the film The Negro of Peter the Great. Production of that film took place at the Mosfilm sound stage, adjacent to where the auditions were being held, and during his breaks Vysotsky often went to see what was happening at Shepitko's sound stage. From the beginning of the search for the actor who would play Sotnikov, Larisa Shepitko instructed Emma Baskakova, her casting assistant, to keep in mind the image of Christ, although it was impossible to mention this out loud. Boris Plotnikov, a 25-year-old actor of the Sverdlovsk Theater, turned out to be the best candidate for the role according to the director, but the officials of Goskino saw in Shepitko's plan the intention to put Jesus on to the Soviet screen. Plotnikov, whose repertoire until then largely included the roles of magical animals, even had to be made up for the purpose of greater glorification of the character so that the artistic council would approve him for the role. The actor went through seven test shots altogether for which he always had to fly to Moscow from Sverdlovsk. For the role of Rybak the director screened 20 candidates. The actor chosen for the role was the unknown actor Vladimir Gostyukhin. Gostyukhin, who had worked for six years in the Soviet Army theater as a furniture and prop maker, had once replaced a sick actor in the play Unknown Soldier. His performance was noticed by Svetlana Klimova, who was the second unit director for Vasiliy Ordynski. Gostyukhin received an invitation to act in the series The Road to Calvary, where he played the role of the anarchist and bandit Krasilnikov for whom charisma and a strong temperament were required. It was while working that set that he was noticed by Larisa Shepitko's assistants. Gostyukhin was invited to audition for the role of Rybak, but initially could not equate \\"a woman of great beauty [Sheptiko] with the super-masculine, tough and tragic story by Vasil B√Ωka≈≠.\\" But after a 20-minute conversation with the director, he was convinced that only she could film the adaptation of this weighty book. Even so, Shepitko initially had doubts about the candidate, who even with his actor's training, was still only a stage laborer. Plotnikov had immediately attracted the director with his constitution, smile, look and plasticity while Gostyukhin's appearance did not coincide with how Shepitko saw Rybak: the young actor came to his audition with \\"frivolous\\" bangs which were uncharacteristic for a partisan. Gostyukhin's rude manners initially alienated other members of the selection committee but Shepitko explained away his behavior as shyness and decided to audition the candidate who had already at the first rehearsal made a strong impression on everyone with his dedication in realizing the character. The actor for the role of Portnov was selected based on the image of Sotnikov. Larisa Shepitko wanted to find someone similar in external characteristics to Plotnikov, saying, \\"They are similar, but Portnov is an antipode to Sotnikov based on internal beliefs. This should be a very good actor. Their duel, yes, yes, the fight with Sotnikov - the eternal conflict, the everlasting battle between spirit and lack of spirituality ... Dying, suffering Sotnikov wins because he is strong in spirit. He dies and rises above his tormentor.\\" Anatoly Solonitsyn at first did not see anything interesting in what he thought of as a \\"supporting role\\", and which he considered a \\"rehash\\" of what had been filmed earlier. Initially, the actor did not even understand what was wanted of him despite the fact that he diligently played the \\"enemy,\\" a \\"man with a bruised heart,\\" or a \\"man without a future\\" as was required. But he felt that the character would turn out to be little but a caricature, as in cheap popular literature. Only a long conversation with the director allowed him to understand her vision of Portnov: the personification of the negative side in the eternal history of man's struggle with the animal inside himself in the name of the supreme value ‚Äì namely, the value of the spirit. The director insisted that the Great Patriotic War was won by the Soviet people because of their high level of awareness, so Portnov's \\"anti-hero\\" role was especially important because the character was supposed to emphasize the superiority of the human spirit's power over matter. =Filming= Filming began on Jan. 6, 1974 ‚Äì the birthday of the director Shepitko (according to other sources filming began on January 5) - in the vicinity of the town of Murom. The first scenes were shot on location in the middle of fields, forests and ravines despite the fact that the weather was forty degrees below zero. According to Boris Plotnikov the frost and the virginal snow were mandatory conditions which Vasil B√Ωka≈≠ had set out in his story. This approach was endorsed by Larisa Shepitko, according to whom the actors had to \\"feel the winter all the way down to their very cells\\" for a more reliable way of entering the character. Together with this, the filming process was planned in such a way that the actors started with the easiest acting in the psychological sense, and scenes which allowed them to gradually sink into their characters. From the outset Shepitko managed to inspire every co-worker with her idea; they understood the film to be about sacred things: motherland, higher values, conscience, duty and spiritual heroism. Her ability to enthrall her colleagues had already manifested before: Yuri Vizbor (lead actor in the movie You and I) said: \\"We worked for Larisa, specifically, personally for her. She had faith and that was the reason. Faith in goodness and the need for our work, and it is this faith that was absolutely a material substance, which can be very real to rely on.\\" In the harsh conditions in which the shoot took place, this factor was very important: extras and crew members were frostbitten, but no one complained. Shepitko herself did not ask for or require special treatment and her colleagues remembered her as an example of courage, faith, patience, and extraordinary care. For example, Boris Plotnikov was dressed very lightly and quickly grew numb from the cold and the piercing winds in the open field; but after the command \\"Stop! Cut!\\" the director came over to him to warm him up and to thank him. She also had to warm up Vladimir Gostyukhin who later wrote: \\"It was worth it ‚Äúto die‚Äù in the scene to be able to feel her gratitude.\\" He said that almost no one knew what effort Shepitko gave when shooting each frame. Sometimes Gostyukhin had to carry the director from the car to the hotel room by himself: Shepitko was sometimes not very well and occasionally her strength weakened. Long before The Ascent, Shepitko became ill with hepatitis on the set of the movie Heat. Ignoring advice to go to Moscow, she went on to shoot the picture from a stretcher on which she was brought from the infectious barracks. Moreover, Shepitko did not recuperate enough, and the consequences of the disease adversely affected her well-being in the future, in particular on the set of The Ascent. In addition she experienced extreme pain which was caused by her recent spinal trauma. But Shepitko still rose two to three hours before the crew to have time to prepare, after which she worked to the maximum limit of her strength throughout the day. For example, in one long scene, the partisans are running away with difficulty through the thick snow from their pursuers. On screen it was necessary to show the deadly fatigue of the flushed, panting people. To avoid hypocrisy in the scenes, the director ran alongside the actors while filming, experiencing their exhausted state with them. With this dedication the shooting took place without interruption and was completed one month ahead of schedule. In order to achieve the desired performance from the actors, Shepitko sometimes talked for a long time with them out in the cold. For example, despite the crew's full readiness, the director would talk for a long time with Boris Plotnikov, whose character she carefully directed during the filming. Shepitko's habit of clearly stating her thoughts contributed to a successful transmission of information; she always avoided abstruse terms that might mask the lack of clarity. She waited for the necessary expression of emotion, for the right facial expression and gestures and then suddenly would give the order to start filming. Boris Plotnikov later said that he would have liked to repeat this experience in other films, but never did. On working with Shepitko, Plotnikov spoke of \\"a meeting with a living genius.\\" Vasil B√Ωka≈≠ also shared a similar opinion about the film's director, he called her \\"Dostoevsky in a skirt.\\" B√Ωka≈≠ valued Larisa Shepitko very highly and once admitted that had he met her before, he would have written Sotnikov differently. Vladimir Gostyukhin described the filming process not as acting but as \\"death in every frame.\\" For him and Plotnikov it was extremely important to validate the director's trust, since she had needed to defend their casting choices long and hard in front of the Soviet film authorities. Gostyukhin spoke of Shepitko's ability to convey an idea to the actors, akin to hypnosis, under which he with Plotnikov - the newcomers to the film studio - could produce the \\"miracle of transformation.\\" During the first rehearsal Shepitko even sprayed their faces with snow. By the latter's suggestion it was done to collect their attention and will and also to give texture and credibility to their characters. Later it became a kind of ritual, often preceding the next take on the film set. Gostyukhin recalled that he transformed into Rybak to such a degree that even the made-up bruise only fell from his face after three weeks. After the film was shot the actor tried for such a long time to leave his role behind and to become himself again that he refused to star in Shepitko's next planned film, entitled Farewell, despite her persistent requests. The production designer Yuriy Raksha later spoke about the situation as follows: =Release= The film was nearly banned: regulatory authorities believed that a \\"religious parable with a mystical tinge\\" was shot instead of a partisan story. The chances were very high that the film would be shelved, until Elem Klimov (the husband of Larisa Shepitko and also a film director by profession) decided to take a desperate step. While Klimov was preparing for the shooting of the film Kill Hitler (which was released under the title of Come and See in 1985), he met with Pyotr Masherov, the first secretary of the Communist Party of Belarus, who strongly supported the director and even acted as a historical consultant. During the war, the senior official was himself a partisan and moreover in 1942 the German occupiers hanged his mother for collaborating with the partisans. When Klimov, bypassing Mosfilm, invited Masherov to a special preview of The Ascent, he initially was skeptical and was expecting to see \\"effeminate directorial work.\\" The still somewhat wet film was brought to Minsk directly from the lab, and Larisa Shepitko herself sat at the mixing console . Twenty or thirty minutes after Masherov had started watching, he found he could not tear himself away from the screen, and by the middle of the movie he was crying, without hiding away from the republic's leaders who were present in the hall. At the end of the film, Masherov - contrary to tradition (usually at such premieres opinions were heard first from the lower ranks and then from the highest) - came on stage and spoke for about forty minutes. His words were not recorded by anyone but Elem Klimov testified that his excited speech was one of the best he ever heard addressed to his wife. The Belarusian writer and veteran of the Great Patriotic War, Ales Adamovich, who was present at the screening, described Masherov as someone who questioned, \\"Where did this girl come from, who of course experienced nothing of the sort, but knows all about it, how could she express it like this?\\" After a few days The Ascent was formally accepted without any amendments. In July 2018, it was selected for screening in the Venice Classics section at the 75th Venice International Film Festival.

It is proposed as the new home of the Oakland Athletics of Major League Baseball. It would serve as the replacement of their current home at Oakland Coliseum where the team has resided since 1968. This would mark the first time that the Athletics franchise has played in a brand new stadium since the completion of Shibe Park in 1909. Summary The Athletics have proposed constructing a 35,000-seat stadium at Howard Terminal owned by the Port of Oakland in Jack London Square. After securing the site, the team proposes to begin construction in 2021 with the stadium opening in 2023. History =Background= Towards the early 2000s, it was becoming clear that the Coliseum was inadequate for the long term future to host the Athletics and the Oakland Raiders of the National Football League. Major League Baseball began pushing the team to pursue a new stadium either in Oakland or elsewhere. The Coliseum was the last facility in Major League Baseball that was also home to a National Football League team (the Raiders left Oakland and began play in Las Vegas starting with the 2020 season). It is also the last stadium remaining of the multi-purpose stadiums of the 1960s designed for both baseball and football in Major League Baseball. In recent years, the Coliseum has been criticized as being one of the \\"worst stadiums in baseball\\". Problems cited include the large amount of foul territory and the addition of Mount Davis. The former allows for more foul-outs while the latter has been criticized for \\"ruining\\" the ambiance of the original configuration. In addition, the stadium has been plagued with sewage issues which include flooding of the dugouts and clubhouses with sewage. The process of finding a new stadium began in 2001 with plans for a stadium in Oakland. After the first plans in Oakland along with plans for a stadium in Fremont and San Jose fell through, the Athletics arrived at a finalized plan. =Timeline= * 1968 ‚Äì The Kansas City Athletics move to Oakland and begin playing at the Coliseum. * 1982 ‚Äì The Oakland Raiders move to Los Angeles leaving the Coliseum as a baseball-only facility. * 1995 ‚Äì The Raiders move back from Los Angeles and the Mount Davis renovation is added to the Coliseum. *2001 ‚Äì Uptown site is proposed, gets rejected by mayor Jerry Brown. * 2005 ‚Äì 66th Avenue site is proposed. * 2006 ‚Äì Cisco Field plan is announced in Fremont. * 2009 ‚Äì Fremont location is abandoned after public resistance. * 2010 ‚Äì City of Oakland proposes waterfront site in Jack London Square at Victory Court for a new ballpark. * 2011 ‚Äì City tables the Victory Court site in favor of a proposed three-venue development at the Coliseum site titled Coliseum City. * 2012 ‚Äì Cisco Field in San Jose is announced, San Francisco Giants object due to territorial rights. * 2014 ‚Äì A's began talks with an architect to build a baseball-only stadium at the Coliseum site. * 2015 ‚Äì United States Supreme Court rejects San Jose's bid on the Athletics. * 2016 ‚Äì Team reveals they will choose between the Port of Oakland, Coliseum site, and the Peralta area for a new stadium. * 2017 ‚Äì Team chooses Peralta area of Oakland near Laney College, is rejected by college board and surrounding Chinatown neighbors. * 2018 ‚Äì Team proposes to buy the Coliseum site outright in exchange for paying off the remaining $135 million debt owed by the city of Oakland and Alameda County. * 2018 ‚Äì Team chooses Port of Oakland/Howard Terminal site and releases renderings. * 2020 - The Raiders leave Oakland for the second time, moving to Las Vegas. * 2020 - Timeline for Howard Terminal ballpark reportedly impacted by the coronavirus pandemic =Early plans (2001‚Äì2005)= The first of the promising early sites had been a site in Uptown Oakland. In a 2001 study, Populous (formerly HOK Sport) had suggested this as the prime site for a ballpark; however, plans to build a park there were canceled by then-Oakland Mayor Jerry Brown due to the concern of the ballpark ruining the housing development of the neighborhood. Brown (who later became governor of California) opted to sell the site to a condominium builder to whom he allegedly had ties. The City of Oakland also considered a site near the Oakland Estuary for a stadium; however, the A's showed no interest in the site due to lack of public transit access. Another possible location that was explored was land directly adjacent to the Coliseum, to the southeast, in what is currently overflow parking, which would have meant the two stadiums would share a parking lot. However, much of that land had already been sold to a condominium developer. =66th Avenue (2005)= Oakland Athletics owner Lewis Wolff presented his vision for the team's venue to the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum Authority on August 12, 2005. The ballpark he proposed would have been on 66th Avenue just north of the Coliseum. The stadium would have been built on what is currently zoned industrial land and would have included a Ballpark Village which would have included shops and either a hotel or apartment building in one of the outfield walls of the park. =Victory Court & Coliseum City (2010)= On November 16, 2010, the City of Oakland proposed a waterfront site in the Jack London Square area for a new A's ballpark. The site, called Victory Court, was near the Lake Merritt Channel along the Oakland Estuary. The city conducted an environmental impact report for the Victory Court site and informed Major League Baseball of its decision. The city began accepting public comment on the ballpark EIR at the December 1 Planning Commission meeting held at Oakland City Hall. By the end of 2011, the city had tabled the Victory Court site in favor of a proposed three-venue development at the Coliseum site titled Coliseum City. =Cisco Field= Fremont (2006) In April 2006, Lewis Wolff took his Ballpark Village proposal to Fremont, a city 26.5 miles (42.65 km) southeast of Oakland, where a large parcel of land was available just north of Mission Boulevard and south of Auto Mall Parkway off Interstate 880 and across from Pacific Commons. The land was owned by the real estate firm Prologis and leased to Cisco Systems.Oakland A's sign Fremont land deal San Francisco Chronicle A formal press conference to announce the existence of Wolff's ballpark proposal of Cisco Field was held on November 14, 2006. The plan would be to build a 32,000 to 35,000 capacity stadium on the parcel of land in addition to adding housing and shops. Bud Selig, commissioner of Major League Baseball and John Chambers, the CEO of Cisco Systems along with Wolff were in attendance. The proposal of the ballpark encountered problems such as delays due to construction issues, lack of public transportation, and complaints from Fremont residents citing traffic congestion, noise, and pollution concerns. This led to Wolff officially ending the ballpark search in Fremont on February 24, 2009. San Jose (2012) In 2012, it was proprosed that Cisco Field be constructed in Downtown San Jose immediately adjacent to SAP Center and San Jose Diridon Station at the corner of Montgomery Street and Park Avenue. For the A's to have moved to San Jose, either the San Francisco Giants would have had to rescind their territorial rights on the area, or at least 23 of the 30 MLB owners would have had to vote in the A's favor and force San Francisco to give up their territorial claim to Santa Clara County. Lew Wolff stated, \\"My goal and desire for the organization is to determine a way to keep the team in Northern California.\\" The Redevelopment Agency of the City of San Jose had been acquiring the properties needed at the Diridon South site. The available land, only , would have given rise to a very intimate stadium. As a result of its small size, it was speculated that it would have been very hitter- friendly. The Giants repeatedly refused to cede their territorial rights to the San Jose area (which had been yielded by the A's in the early 1990s when the Giants had been in danger of relocating to Tampa Bay, previously both teams had shared the South Bay), although the team is open to sharing Oracle Park with the A's on a temporary basis if the A's have plans for a permanent stadium in the works. In August 2012, Commissioner Bud Selig's \\"blue ribbon\\" committee, which had been implemented to study potential ballpark locations for the Athletics, met with Oakland and San Jose officials. At the Oakland meeting, the committee was met with a proposal for a ballpark on the site of Howard Terminal, a container terminal on the Oakland waterfront near Jack London Square currently owned by the Port of Oakland. Wolff stated the site \\"has no ability to be implemented for a ballpark.\\" Major League Baseball, however, stated that it was their preferred location for a new ballpark in Oakland, and later developed a plan to develop the location. On October 5, 2015, the United States Supreme Court rejected San Jose's bid on the Athletics. = Back to Oakland (2014‚Äìpresent) = On June 25, 2014, the Athletics reached a 10-year lease agreement with the Oakland‚ÄìAlameda County Coliseum Authority to stay at the Coliseum. Bud Selig commended both sides for reaching a deal on a lease extension, while offering, \\"I continue to believe that the Athletics need a new facility and am fully supportive of the club's view that the best site in Oakland is the Coliseum site.\\" On July 16, 2014, the extension was officially approved.Goodell: Levi's might fit Raiders ESPN.com (July 18, 2014) On August 6, 2014, the A's commenced talks with a possible architect to build a baseball-only stadium at the Coliseum site, according to Wolff. Ownership change (2016) In 2016, Lewis Wolff resigned as the majority owner of the team. John J. Fisher then took over as majority owner. Fisher appointed Dave Kaval as team president and head of the stadium project. Around the same time, the Raiders announced their relocation to Las Vegas in 2020 in addition to the Golden State Warriors move to Chase Center in San Francisco in September 2019. This left the Athletics as the last professional sports team in Oakland. The team revealed three stadium options in 2016, the current Coliseum site, the Peralta area near Laney College, or Howard Terminal at Jack London Square. Peralta Site (2017) After a comprehensive study of three proposed ballpark sites (Coliseum site, Howard Terminal, and Peralta Community College Headquarters District), the A's ownership determined that the best potential site to fit the needs of the A's and create the most community partnership opportunities and benefits was the Peralta site. The team announced that the Peralta site would be the preferred choice for the A's new ballpark on September 13, 2017. The area is located between Lake Merritt and I-880 where there are warehouses, parking lots and administrative offices for the Peralta Community College District. Opposition to the project included members of the Peralta Federation of Teachers, select student and facility groups of neighboring Laney College and a local coalition of organizations led by the Asian Pacific Environmental Network (APEN). After several months of preliminary discussions amongst the A's and the Peralta Community College's Office of the Chancellor Jowel Laguerre, Chancellor of Peralta Community College District, a statement was issued by the Chancellor indicating that he had been instructed to \\"discontinue planning\\" for the ballpark after a closed session meeting of the Peralta Community College District Board of Trustees on the evening of December 5, 2017. =Current plan= Howard Terminal in 2018  Ballpark at Howard Terminal proposal  In November 2018, a plan for a \\"jewel box\\" design for the stadium at Howard Terminal met with a \\"tepid welcome,\\" with the next version in February 2019 showing a \\"smoother and more circular stadium.\\" At the time, the A's still had not acquired Howard Terminal. The A's proposed plan is to build a privately financed, 34,000-seat ballpark at Howard Terminal, including fixed seats and general admission experience areas. The ballpark will feature an elevated park that wraps and frames the bowl, coming down to meet the waterfront and a promenade called Athletics Way. The proposed ballpark is intended to create a new waterfront district with a mixture of real estate, including affordable housing, offices, restaurants, retail, small business space, parks, and public gathering spaces. Bjarke Ingels Group (BIG) was hired as the lead designer in developing plans for both the stadium and the surrounding development around the new ballpark. It was BIG's first Major League Baseball stadium commission. A revised design by BIG came out in February 2019, retaining its rooftop park with community access and developing \\"3.3 million square feet of housing, 1.5 million square feet of commercial and office space, a hotel and a performance center in the area surrounding the stadium.\\" Located near Downtown Oakland, the Charles P. Howard Terminal is west of Jack London Square and is adjacent to railroad tracks and large industrial facilities. The waterfront property is currently owned by the Port of Oakland. Howard Terminal has not been used by a cargo vessel since 2013. On April 26, 2018, the Port of Oakland commissioners voted 6-0 unanimously to enter in to a one-year agreement to negotiate exclusively with the Oakland A's. This agreement allows the A's to pay the Port $100,000 to study economic feasibility and environmental, transportation and accessibility issues. A similar agreement with the A's regarding the Coliseum site was also agreed upon with the city on May 16, 2017. By March 2019 the MLB had completed an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) for the Howard Terminal ballpark proposal. On February 22, 2019, the Oakland A's announced a partnership with the West Oakland Environmental Indicators Project (WOEIP) to enhance the long-term sustainability of the neighborhoods of West Oakland and improve the quality of life for local residents. The partnership is part of a series of environmentally focused plans being promoted by the A's, including committing to LEED gold standard of design with the ballpark; a target of reducing car trips to the new ballpark by 20%; achieving net zero emissions; possibly building an electrically powered gondola that connects the ballpark to mass transit; and adding protections to the site in anticipation of future sea level rise caused by climate change. The A's are also working with the City of Oakland on a race and equity analysis to ensure the project produces community benefits for Oakland residents. Union Pacific, according to the San Francisco Chronicle, voiced concerns over the Howard Terminal as the ballpark's location in April 2019, due to issues of safety concerning the active train tracks on one side of the site. Maritime officials had also voiced concerns that bright lights from the stadium might interfere with the Inner Harbor's shipping traffic at night. On May 11, 2019, the Alameda Labor Council, AFL-CIO, voted to support the Oakland A's efforts to build a new ballpark at Howard Terminal. The Council expressed strong support for the project given its potential to provide significant economic benefits for working families throughout the East Bay. According to a report issued by the Bay Area Council Economic Institute, the privately financed ballpark project would create approximately 2,000 construction jobs and even more permanent jobs would be generated by the ongoing operation of the ballpark. In addition to the A's ballpark project at Howard Terminal, the Council also officially endorsed the A's redevelopment project at the Coliseum site, provided it also includes community benefits.  Coliseum Redevelopment  As part of the ballpark plan, the Athletics have committed to redevelopment of the Coliseum site. Preliminary plans include parks, affordable housing, a skills center, and office and retail space. The Oakland Arena will continue to serve as a concert venue and as the home of the Oakland Panthers of the Indoor Football League. In March 2018, the A's sent a letter to the City of Oakland proposing to purchase the entire Coliseum property including Oakland Arena and develop it into a new ballpark and ballpark village in exchange for paying off $135 million of debt owed on the property by the City of Oakland and Alameda County. On April 23, 2019, the Alameda County Board of Supervisors voted 5-0 to approve the term sheet between the County and the Oakland Athletics providing for the possible purchase by the A's of the County's 50% interest in the Oakland Alameda County Coliseum Complex for $85 million. On September 27, 2019, the Oakland City Council filed a lawsuit against Alameda County over the pending sale of the Coliseum site to the Athletics alleging that the sale violates the Surplus Land Act. After intervention by Major League Baseball commissioner Rob Manfred, city council backed off the lawsuit in exchange for negotiations between the city and the county to work out a ‚Äúshared strategy‚Äù for the future of the Coliseum site outside of court. On November 14, 2019, the Oakland City Council officially dropped its lawsuit against Alameda County. Approved Howard Terminal plan On May 13, 2019, the board commissioners of the Port of Oakland voted 7-0 to approve and authorize the Executive Director to execute the initial term sheet for a term of four years. In October 2019, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed into law two bills intended to streamline the stadium process at the state level. Ballpark Digest in May 2020 reported that the Howard Terminal ballpark plan \\"may end up being delayed or even scrapped, as the COVID-19 pandemic and underlying economic uncertainty will certainly impact facility planning for the Athletics.\\" Just prior, the A's VP of communications had stated \\"the timeline may be adjusted due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\\" In July 2020, the East \\"Oakland Stadium Alliance\\" held a protest with \\"hundreds of cars\\" on the A's Opening Night to protest the Howard Terminal proposal and the Coliseum sale.

Biography =Background= Bullitt was born to Thomas Walker Bullitt and Annie P. Logan in Louisville, Kentucky on March 4, 1873. His ancestors arrived in Kentucky in the 1700s: the Bullitts, the Walkers, the Christians (relatives of Patrick Henry) and the Logans (descended from United States Supreme Court Chief Justice John Marshall). His father studied law in Philadelphia. He began his collegiate career at Princeton University, earning a bachelor's degree in 1894. He received a law degree from the University of Louisville in 1895. =Early career= That same year (1895), Bullitt entered law practice in his hometown of Louisville, where he established himself as a senior member of his firm Bullitt, Dawson & Tarrant. He practiced law there until his death in 1957. =Politics= Bullitt served as a delegate-at-large at the 1908 Republican National Convention in Chicago. He made speeches on behalf of practically all Louisville Republicans during election time. If he did not think the election officers were performing up to his standards, he proceeded to have them arrested. Bulliit proved his dedication to President William Howard Taft and the Republican Party by leading Taft's election forces in Kentucky throughout his run for president in 1909. =Solicitor General (1912-1913)= Taft appointed Bullitt Solicitor General on June 28, 1912. During his service (1912-1913), Bullitt argued cases involving enforcement of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act on cotton corners, and publicity laws and mail rates regarding newspapers and their circulation. Other cases he argued in front of the U.S. Supreme Court involved income taxation of federal judicial salaries, taxation of state bonds and municipal securities, the Federal Farm Act, and the Rehabilitation Act of California. =After government= Bullitt was Kentucky's Republican nominee for Senate in 1914, but was defeated. For the remainder of his life, he was active not only as a lawyer but also as a banker, academic, and author. He taught at Harvard University and served as a member of the committee on mathematics there. He became a Fellow of Pierpont Morgan Library and was a member of the Louisville Bar Association, American Math Association, Amateur Astronomy Association, and the American Law Institute. =Carnegie Endowment and Alger Hiss= In 1933, Bullitt joined the trustees of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace after being nominated by his successor as solicitor general, John W. Davis. Often critical of Carnegie, he was one of the most vociferous regarding Alger Hiss, first because of the irregular procedure in accepting Hiss and president and then after following HUAC hearings in August 1948. During late November and early December 1948, he wrote a \\"Factual Review of the Whittaker Chambers-Alger Hiss Controversy,\\" which he soon after had published. With this review, he voted on December 13, 1948, that the trustees accept Hiss's resignation as president but accepted the board's majority vote for leave of absence without pay. Bullitt then attended both trials of Hiss during 1949 and provided Federal prosecutor Thomas Murphy with his review as a legal aid. Personal life Bullitt was known to be a very slight man who one Kentuckian remarked could \\"talk faster than any man in Kentucky.\\" He was a noted collector of rare mathematics texts. Following a discussion with his friend G. H. Hardy, Bullitt set out to obtain first-edition works by what he considered the twenty-five greatest mathematicians of all time. Following his death, this collection, which grew to include at least 300 volumes by at least sixty different mathematicians, was donated to the University of Louisville. Among the texts in the collection are works by Albert Einstein, Isaac Newton, Ren√© Descartes, Galileo, Copernicus, Euclid, Carl Friedrich Gauss, Leonhard Euler, and Gottfried Leibniz.The William Marshall Bullitt CollectionWilliam Marshall Bullitt Collection of Rare Mathematics and Astronomy In November 1956, thieves cracked a wall safe in his Oxmoor home. Police estimated the amount of valuables taken as high as $250,000, of which $77,000 was recovered by the time Bullitt died a year later. Death Bullitt died on October 3, 1957, of a heart attack at the age of 84. Bullitt was buried at Oxmoor Cemetery in Kentucky. Impact Bullitt argued more than fifty cases in front of the U.S. Supreme Court, some of which were argued while serving as Solicitor General of the United States.

SISSA is active in the fields of mathematics, physics, and neuroscience, offering both undergraduate and post-graduate courses. Each year, about 70 PhD students are admitted to SISSA based on their scientific qualifications. SISSA also runs master's programs in the same areas, in collaboration with both Italian and other European universities. History SISSA was founded in 1978, as a part of the reconstruction following the Friuli earthquake of 1976. Although the city of Trieste itself did not suffer any damage, physicist Paolo Budinich asked and obtained from the Italian government to include in the interventions the institution of a new, post-graduate teaching and research institute, modeled on the Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa. The school became operative with a PhD course in theoretical physics, and Budinich himself was appointed as general director. In 1986, Budinich left his position to Daniele Amati, who at the time was at the head of the theoretical division at CERN. Under his leadership, SISSA expanded its teaching and research activity towards the field of neuroscience, and instituted a new interdisciplinary laboratory aiming at connecting humanities and scientific studies. From 2001 to 2004, the director was the Italian geneticist Edoardo Boncinelli, who fostered the development of the existing research areas. Other directors were appointed in the following years, which saw the strengthening of SISSA collaboration with other Italian and European universities in offering master's degree programs in the three areas of the School (mathematics, physics and neuroscience). The physicist Stefano Ruffo, the current director, was appointed in 2015. He signed a partnership with the International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology to set up a new PhD program in Molecular Biology, with teaching activity organized by both institutions. Organization SISSA houses the following research groups: * Astroparticle PhysicsAstroparticle Physics * AstrophysicsAstrophysics * Condensed MatterCondensed Matter * Molecular and Statistical BiophysicsMolecular and Statistical Biophysics * Statistical PhysicsStatistical Physics * Theoretical Particle PhysicsTheoretical Particle Physics * Cognitive NeuroscienceCognitive Neuroscience * NeurobiologyNeurobiology * Molecular Biology * Applied Mathematics * GeometryGeometry * Mathematical AnalysisMathematical Analysis * Mathematical PhysicsMathematical Physics In addition, there is the Interdisciplinary Laboratory for Natural and Humanistic Sciences (now LISNU - Laboratorio Interdisciplinare Scienze Naturali e Umanistiche),Interdisciplinary Laboratory for Advanced Studies which is endowed with the task of making connections between science, humanities, and the public. It currently offers a course in Scientific Communication and Scientific journalism. SISSA also enjoys special teaching and scientific links with the International Centre for Theoretical Physics, the International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology and the Elettra Synchrotron Light Laboratory.Elettra (Synchrotron Light Laboratory) Services The School provides students and members of other scientific institutions in the Trieste area with specialised Mathematics and Physics libraries, a parallel Calculus Centre, several cellular-neurobiology laboratories, a confocal microscopy and an electronic microscopy laboratory and multiple cognitive-neuroscience laboratories. In the school premises there is also a canteen, a kindergarten and a gym, open to SISSA staff and students. In the school garden there is an open air theatre, used for shows, conferences and activities that aim to promote science to a wider public. Recently SISSA, in partnership with the International Centre for Theoretical Physics, built a new supercomputing centre in Miramare, near Trieste, with about 100 teraFLOPS of computing power. Ranking According to the last aggregate data issued by ANVUR - the Italian National Agency for the Evaluation of the University and Research Systems - SISSA ranks: * first among medium-sized universities and research centers in physical science, with a 22% positive variance in the number of products compared to the Italian average; * first among small-sized universities and research centers in biological science, owing to the activity carried out in neuroscience, with a 64% positive variance; * second among small-sized universities in mathematical and computer science. With reference to the latter, the positive variance in the scientific production corresponded to 46% compared to the national average, placing SISSA 1% away from the Scuola Normale di Pisa. Campus Since July 13, 2010 the campus has been located near Opicina, where it is easily accessible by Opicina tramway. Up to 2010 SISSA administrative offices and all research sectors were located near the Miramare Park, about 10 kilometres from the city of Trieste.

He started working young as a farm hand, became a carpenter's apprentice, and settled as architect and builder in the South. At the outbreak of the civil war in 1861 he returned to the North. From 1862 to 1864 Sweet worked as mechanical draftsman in England, and back in the States was engaged in bridge building. He also made some inventions. At the Paris Exhibition of 1867 he had made quite an impression with the introduction of his linotype machine.

History = Founding = The first decades of the 20th century were a time of heightened awareness in the United States of poverty and social inequality. In an effort to transform the social order and address human suffering, members of the Methodist Episcopal Church (MEC) created in 1907 the organization that would come to be called the Methodist Federation for Social Service and later the Methodist Federation for Social Action. The aims of their Methodist Federation for Social Service (MFSS) were inspired in a large part by the importance that Methodism founder John Wesley placed on work for the betterment of humankind, and shared the theological grounding of the broader Protestant Social Gospel movement, which articulated a normative relationship between the Biblical teachings of Jesus Christ and efforts toward systemic social change. Originally the Methodist Federation for Social Service, MFSA was founded in 1907 in Washington, DC after meeting with President Roosevelt. Several Methodist Episcopal clergy (including Frank Mason North, author of \\"Where Cross the Crowded Ways of Life\\") organized the Federation to direct church attention to the enormous human suffering among the working class. The organization supported labor unions and held socialist views, calling industrial capitalism an \\"unchristian and antisocial\\". MFSA met with immediate success in rallying American Methodists around Social Gospel issues, and the MEC General Conference of 1908 adopted the denomination's historic Social Creed which was penned by the leadership of the Federation. The social creed has been adapted several times but is also the basis for many of the civil and human rights laws that exist today. The lines between the nominally independent Federation and the MEC proper were quickly blurred as the former was charged with the coordination of Social Creed-related ministries. The collaboration was a productive one, however, with MFSA members encouraging significant contributions to the labor rights, Temperance, and Women's Suffrage movements by the denomination, while conducting cutting-edge advocacy under their organization's own auspices. = McConnell and Ward era = For almost four decades thereafter the Federation was led by Bishop Francis John McConnell and Harry F. Ward, an outstanding church ethicist and activist. During the 1920s and 1930s this leadership was fully shared by Winifred Chappell, a deaconess and devoted advocate for the workers' struggle. In the 1930s the Federation adopted as its goal the replacement of an economic system based on the struggle for profit by \\"social- economic planning to develop a society without class or group discriminations and privileges.\\" By the onset of the 1930s and the Great Depression, the MFSA consensus position on economic affairs had come to question the basic capitalist underpinnings of the U.S. economy, and the Federation joined the ranks of those advocating for a functional socialist alternative. In 1932, the church voiced its support for MFSA's views, but by 1936, the socialist viewpoint was a major source of controversy within the Methodist Church. The Church dropped the Social Creed from the Book of Discipline in that year, but reinstated it in 1939. = World War II and the Red Scare = The 1940s were a time of continued growth for the MFSA, as it continued its economic justice activities while contributing to the World War II peace movement. The organization, alongside the Women's Division, also strongly lobbied to end segregation in the church. MFSA attained the height of its growth just following World War II under the leadership of Jack McMichael. By 1950, the MFSA was highly influential in the Methodist Church. While the MFSA had only 5,800 members compared to 9 million in the entire Methodist Church, this membership included half of the church's 16 bishops, as well as having representatives in all the major seminaries at the time. However, with the coming of the anti-communist hysteria of the McCarthy period, relations with The Methodist Church became very strained and the Federation came under sharp attack. In his article Methodism's Pink Fringe, Stanley High accused the MFSA of being pro-Soviet. The group was investigated by the House un-American Activities Committee in 1952. The MFSA was one the chief victim of McCarthyism among religious groups, an attack vicious enough that the Church dropped its connection with the MFSA that year, and the MFSA continued as an independent organization. In the wake of these events MFSA experienced a serious decline. However, a dedicated remnant of volunteers kept the group operating, and in 1960, new director Lee Ball began the rebuilding process and started a campaign against the Vietnam War. = Post-war = Over the past six decades MFSA has experienced a broad revival and has re-established the Federation as a force within United Methodism. In 1974 MFSA sent organizers to support the striking non-professionals at the UM hospital in Pikeville, Kentucky. In 1979 the Federation issued a documented study of the New Far Right presence in the denomination and rallied forces to stem its influence. MFSA was the leading force in the struggle for UM support of disinvestment from South Africa, especially by the Board of Pensions. The MFSA, inspired by Latin American liberation theology, resumed its criticism of capitalism. The church advocated for gay rights in the 1980s and 1990s. The Federation continues to make a major impact every four years at the denomination's General Conference. New MFSA conference chapters continue to be organized and now total 38 chapters, with representation in every jurisdiction. There are several new chapters in the formation process. The Federation unites activist United Methodists to promote action on the liberation issues of peace, poverty and people's right while confronting the church and society and to witness to the transformation of the social order that is intrinsic to the church's entire life, including its evangelism, preaching, counseling, and spirituality.

Life and work  Fellowes was born in Paddington, London, on 11 November 1870, the fifth child of Horace Decimus Fellowes, assistant director of the Royal Army Clothing Depot, and his wife Louisa Emily, daughter of Edmund Packe, a Captain in the Royal Horse Guards. Fellowes showed musical ability at an early age and in 1878 received an offer from Joseph Joachim to become his violin pupil; the offer was not taken up and Fellowes went to Winchester College.Sabben-Clare, James. Winchester College. Cave, 1981. p. 119 He studied as an undergraduate at Oriel College, Oxford from 1889 to 1892, taking a fourth class in theology and becoming a Bachelor of Music and Master of Arts in 1896. Fellowes became an ordained deacon in 1894 and priest in 1895, and held a curacy in Wandsworth, after which he became precentor of Bristol Cathedral in 1897. On 12 January 1899 he married Lilian Louisa, a daughter of Admiral Sir Richard Vesey Hamilton. He was a minor canon of St. George's Chapel, Windsor from 1900 to 1951, and from 1924 to 1927, he was in charge of the choir following the death of the conductor Sir Walter Parratt. Fellowes' passion for mid-16th century ‚Äì mid-17th century music led him to edit thirty- six volumes of madrigals, thirty-two volumes of lute songs, and twenty volumes of William Byrd's music. He was one of the editors of Tudor Church Music, ten volumes published by Oxford University Press in the 1920s with the support of the Carnegie UK Trust. His work covered not only the music, but important biographical and critical writing such as The English Madrigal Composers, published in 1921 and William Byrd, published in 1936. Fellowes was honorary librarian of St. Michael's College, Tenbury from 1918 until 1948, and during this time he arranged and catalogued the musical library of Sir Frederick Ouseley. He was succeeded in this post by Watkins Shaw. Fellowes' works were recognised by his alma mater and he was appointed an honorary fellow of Oriel in 1937, he also received honorary doctorates in music from Dublin University in 1917, Oxford University in 1939, and Cambridge University in 1950. Fellowes was interested in cricket, and in 1930, he published History of Winchester Cricket. He was appointed a Member of the Royal Victorian Order in 1931 and in 1944 he became a Companion of Honour. He was president of the Musical Association from 1942 until 1947, where he aided them secure a Royal affiliation, and president of the Church Music Society from 1946 until 1951, following on from Archbishop Lang. Fellowes died at 12 Clarence Road, Clewer Within, Windsor, on 21 December 1951. Fellowes' editions of English Tudor church music represent a very significant contribution to 20th Century musical scholarship, bringing to new prominence composers such as Byrd and Orlando Gibbons, whose work was thus made accessible to composers and scholars, notably Ralph Vaughan Williams, whose revision of The English Hymnal was influenced by study of these themes in Fellowes' editions.Vaughan Williams Studies, Alain Frogley] He lectured extensively on the subject, travelling numerous times to the United States for this purpose. His was the foremost work in the Anglican Tudor revival of the early 20th Century. Other interests included cricket, writing A History of Winchester Cricket, and music performance, titling his memoirs the Memoirs of an Amateur Musician.

A eunuch, he succeeded John I as exarch. Early in his reign, nearly the entire exarchate was unstable.

Eleutherius arrived in Ravenna and immediately put to death \\"all who had been implicated in the death of Exarch John and the judges of the State.\\" Then, after making a courtesy visit to Pope Deusdedit, Eleutherius marched on Naples, and captured that city, killing the rebel John and his supporters.Raymond Davis (translator), The Book of Pontiffs (Liber Pontificalis), first edition (Liverpool: University Press, 1989), p. 63.

In his translation of Paul's History of the Lombards (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania, 1974, p. 176n. 4), William Dudley Foulke, writes that Eleutherius' tribute was 500 pounds of gold. Finding the situation in Italy to be unsatisfactory and taking advantage of the Byzantine Emperor Heraclius' preoccupation with the Sassanids, Eleutherius proclaimed himself emperor in 619, with the intent of setting up his capital in Rome. The following year, while on his way to Rome and still deciding how to convince Pope Boniface V to grant him a crown, he was murdered by his soldiers at the fortress of Luceoli, and his head was sent to Heraclius.Paul the Deacon, History of the Lombards (4.36), p. 176; Liber Pontificalis (Davis translation), p. 63.

P. 9 Career  Dinsmore performed his graduate studies at the University of Pittsburgh, and earned a master's in astronomy with additional studies in the field of meteorology. In 1911, he became an instructor at the University of Alabama, teaching physics and astronomy. The following year he became an assistant professor, then an adjunct professor in 1913. In 1914, he moved to the University of California in Berkeley, teaching astronomy while also studying for his doctorate. He gained his Ph.D. in astronomy in 1916. By 1917, he became an assistant professor of astronomy at the University of Kansas. However, when the United States entered World War I, he took time off to serve as a major in the United States Army. After returning home following the war, he rejoined the University of Kansas, and would remain at that institution for nearly 20 years. He was promoted to assistant professor in 1919, then professor in 1924. From 1925 until 1927, he served as the vice-president of the American Meteorological Society. He was then awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship scholarship and spent two years studying astronomy in Britain. In 1935, he took a leave from the University of Kansas and became director of the Griffith Observatory. A year later he resigned his professorship to remain director at the observatory. He also served as a research associate at Caltech in Pasadena during the same period. After the U.S. entered the Second World War, Dr. Alter took a leave from his position to serve in the armed forces for four years. He became a colonel and served in a transport division. He remained a member of the army reserve following the war, training at Fort MacArthur, Los Angeles. His earlier studies had focused on solar observation, but after the war he concentrated on the Moon. As his expertise increased, he became an authority on the geology of the Moon, including its surface and history. He also remained involved in astronomy research, and in 1950 he served a term as president of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific. In 1956, he used the 60\\" reflector at the Mount Wilson Observatory to observe a peculiar obscuration on part of the floor of Alphonsus crater, which brought him worldwide notice. (This is a class of events now called a transient lunar phenomenon.) During 1958, he reached mandatory retirement age, and was officially retired on March 31 and was succeeded by Clarence H. Cleminshaw, who had been associate director of the observatory.\\"GENERAL NOTES.\\" Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific 70, no. 413 (1958): 228‚Äì31. https://www.jstor.org/stable/40676908 However, he remained active during his retirement, writing several books on astronomy and performing consulting services.

It has even spawned a lawn greeting industry where flocks of pink flamingos are installed on a victim's lawn in the dark of night. After the release of John Waters's 1972 movie Pink Flamingos, Published: November 1, 2006. From the Associated Press plastic flamingos came to be the stereotypical example of lawn kitsch. Many imitation products have found their way onto front lawns and store shelves since then. Genuine pink flamingos made by Union Products from 1987 (the 30th anniversary of the plastic flamingo) until 2001 can be identified by the signature of Don Featherstone located on the rear underside. These official flamingos were sold in pairs, with one standing upright and the other with its head low to the ground, \\"feeding\\". Sometime after Featherstone's retirement in 2000, Union Products began producing birds without the signature. In December 2001, the Annals of Improbable Research (bestowers of the Ig Nobel prize) teamed up with the Museum of Bad Art to protest this omission in the form of a boycott. Union Products, of Leominster, Massachusetts, stopped production of pink flamingos on November 1, 2006. =HMC International LLC= However, HMC International LLC, a subsidiary of Faster-Form Corporation, purchased the copyright and plastic molds of Featherstone's original plastic flamingos in 2007.

From the Associated Press, on the purchase and re- production of Don Featherstone's original plastic-flamingo design. In 2010, Cado Manufacturing purchased the copyrights and the entire Union Products product line, including the pink flamingo, from HMC. Cado continues to manufacture the Union Products line, and production of the pink flamingo has increased in recent times. Trivia In 2009, the city of Madison, Wisconsin Common Council designated the plastic flamingo as the city's official bird. The city's soccer club, Forward Madison FC, uses the plastic flamingo on its logo. Some homeowners associations forbid the installation of plastic flamingos and similar lawn ornaments, and will fine offending owners, based on the theory that such decorations lower the neighborhood's real estate values.  In popular culture  In the media and fiction, plastic flamingos are often used as a symbol of kitsch, bad taste and cheapness. * The movie Pink Flamingos is named after them and helped them become an icon of trash and kitsch. * In the television sitcom ALF, jokes about the garden flamingos of the neighboring Ochmonek couple are a running gag. * In the computer game The Sims, plastic flamingos are the cheapest garden decoration. * The animated film Gnomeo & Juliet features a garden flamingo named after its inventor, Featherstone.

Biju Patnaik International Airport is the nearest and only operational commercial airport to reach Paradip. History During early 17th century, Paradip and its adjoining areas were connected with Cuttack through river Mahanadi and its branches. Transportation of goods from rural areas to Cuttack was done through waterways via Dhamara and Pattamundai. But slowly this discontinued due to silting of the river bed. In 1819, the British constructed a sort of a harbour at north of the present Paradip site the then called False Point. In 1862, the East India Irrigation Company explored the potential of Paradip for transportation of rice from the area. The importance of Paradip grew more during the great famine of 1866, when it was used as the main entry point for import of food materials to the famine struck area. During early post-independent period, a minor port came into existence at Paradip in 1958 through the efforts of the State Government. Subsequently, the Government decided to construct a major port there. The foundation stone for Paradip Port was laid by late Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, the then Prime Minister of India on 3 January 1962. On completion in 1965, the port was taken over by the Government of India from the State Government on 1 June 1965 and port was declared open on 12 March 1966. Paradip Port was declared as the 8th major port of India and the first major deep sea port in the east coast commissioned after independence.

She joined Mango Groove at age 17, and has since recorded six studio albums with the band, toured extensively, and released two solo albums. She has come to be recognised as a symbol of the Rainbow Nation, Desmond Tutu's vision of a multicultural South Africa in the post-apartheid era. Among her musical influences she lists Ella Fitzgerald and Debbie Harry, as well as Louis Armstrong and the crooners of the mid-20th century. For a time she was married to Mango Groove founder John Leyden. She lives in Johannesburg, South Africa. Early life Johnston was born in Bishops Stortford, a town in the Southern England county of Hertfordshire. Her family relocated to South Africa when she was age three. At the age of ten, she debuted as an actor, dancer, and singer in a Johannesburg production of the musical Annie. At age 17, during her final year at Greenside High School, she joined the crossover band Mango Groove. Despite her obligations to the band, she completed a degree in English, Philosophy, and Politics at the University of the Witwatersrand in 1988. Career With Johnston as the front woman, Mango Groove had already released several singles before completing their first album, Mango Groove, which they released in 1989. These pre-album singles Johnston recorded while still working toward her undergraduate degree. Three more studio albums‚Äîand numerous singles‚Äîfollowed in the 1990s. After Mango Groove released their fourth studio album in 1995, they did not produce another until 2009's Bang the Drum.

The Boulevard replaced numerous small streets which approximated its path, including, from west to east (to the current boulevard Saint- Michel), the Rue Saint-Dominique, Rue Taranne, Rue Sainte-Marguerite, Rue des Boucheries and Rue des Cordeliers.Saint-Germain-des-Pr√©s et son faubourg, Dominique Leborgne, Editions Parigramme, Paris 2005, One landmark removed to make way for the project was the prison of the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Pr√©s which stood entirely on what is now the Boulevard, just west of what is now the Passage de la Petite Boucherie. The boulevard derives its name from the church of Saint-Germain-des-Pr√©s which dates back to the Middle Ages. This area around the boulevard is also referred to as the Faubourg (\\"Suburb\\") Saint-Germain which developed around the abbey. In the 17th century, the Saint-Germain quarter became a major site for noble town houses, or h√¥tels particuliers. This reputation continued throughout the 19th century, where the old aristocracy of the Saint-Germain quarter is frequently contrasted with the new upper bourgeoisie of the Right Bank, having their homes on the Boulevard Saint-Honor√© or on the Champs-√âlys√©es (as noted, for example, in the novels of Honor√© de Balzac and Marcel Proust). From the 1930s on, Saint-Germain has been associated with its nightlife, caf√©s and students (the boulevard traverses the Latin Quarter). Home to a number of famous caf√©s, such as Les Deux Magots and Caf√© de Flore, the Saint-Germain quarter was the centre of the existentialism movement best associated with Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir. On 27 March 2000, this was commemorated by the city of Paris which renamed the area in front of the Saint-Germain Church, at the intersection of the Boulevard Saint-Germain and Rue Bonaparte, the Place Jean-Paul Sartre et Simone de Beauvoir.Saint-Germain-des-Pr√©s et son faubourg, p. 73, Dominique Leborgne, Editions Parigramme, Paris 2005, After the Second World War the Boulevard Saint-Germain became the intellectual and cultural site for Parisian life. Philosophers, authors and musicians filled the night clubs and brasseries that line the boulevard. The boulevard today is a thriving high-end shopping street with stores from Armani to Rykiel. The cafes continue to be sites for intellectual and political gatherings and the nightlife continues to thrive. Nearby is the Institut d'√©tudes politiques (\\"Sciences Po\\") and the College des Ingenieurs. Noted addresses At 184 Boulevard Saint-Germain is the Soci√©t√© de G√©ographie, the world's oldest geographical society, founded in 1821 by von Humboldt, Chateaubriand, Dumont d‚ÄôUrville, Champollion among others. It has had its headquarters here since 1878. The entrance is marked by two gigantic caryatids representing Land and Sea. It was here, in 1879, that the construction of the Panama Canal was decided. Nowadays the building accommodates Ipag - √©cole sup√©rieure de commerce. Vestiges of former streets Some vestiges of the streets removed to make way for the Boulevard still remain today. There are still a few sections of original streets, e.g., the current Rue Gozlin, part of the former Rue Sainte-Marguerite, which now consists of a single very short city block between the Place du Quebec (at the Rue Bonaparte) and the Rue des Ciseaux. As well, parts of original streets have more or less been maintained in their original state, but incorporated into the Boulevard as short narrow sections separated from the main Boulevard by a traffic island. For example, there is the south side of the boulevard at the Place Henri Mondor, south of the Odeon Metro station, which is the former Rue des Cordeliers (later renamed Rue de l'Ecole de M√©decine) and an extension of the current Rue de L'Ecole de M√©decine, but is now considered as being the Boulevard Saint-Germain. Another example is the south side of the boulevard just east of the Rue des Ciseaux, which extends the current Rue Gozlin, formerly Rue Sainte-Marguerite. The north side of the Rue Gozlin and this short section extending it represent exactly how much further south the abbey extended before the creation of the Boulevard Saint-Germain. In some sections of the boulevard, a side of the former street was preserved and the buildings are much older than the Haussmannian facades that comprise most of the rest of the buildings on the boulevard. For example, the buildings on the north side of the boulevard between the Rue de Buci and the rue de Seine are the original north side the former Rue des Boucheries (renamed Rue de l'Ecole de M√©decine in 1846).Saint-Germain-des-Pr√©s et son faubourg, p. 118, Dominique Leborgne, Editions Parigramme, Paris 2005, At 175 Boulevard Saint-Germain at the corner of the Rue des Saint-Peres stands a building originally built in 1678 and still bearing the street sign for the Rue Taranne.

Biography Ajaan Mun was born in Baan Kham Bong, a farming village in Ubon Ratchathani Province, Isan. Ordained as a monk in 1893, he spent the remainder of his life wandering through Thailand, Burma, and Laos, dwelling for the most part in the forest, engaged in the practice of meditation. He attracted an enormous following of students and, together with his teacher, Sao Kantasƒ´lo (1861‚Äì1941) established the Thai Forest Tradition (the kamma·π≠·π≠hƒÅna tradition) that subsequently spread throughout Thailand and to several countries abroad. He died at Wat Suddhavasa, Sakon Nakhon Province. Forest meditation Ajaan Mun's mode of practice was solitary and strict. He followed the vinaya (monastic discipline) faithfully, and also observed many of what are known as the 13 classic dhutanga (ascetic) practices, such as living off alms food, wearing robes made of cast-off rags, dwelling in the forest and eating only one meal a day. Monks following this tradition are known as thudong, the Thai pronunciation of this Pali word. Searching out secluded places in the wilds of Thailand and Laos, he avoided the responsibilities of settled monastic life and spent long hours of the day and night in meditation. In spite of his reclusive nature, he attracted a large following of students willing to put up with the hardships of forest life in order to study with him.

They also aid with the identification of clouds during bright sunshine or glare from snow. The goggles are made with red-tinted plastic lenses. Such goggles or glasses are often used by pilots and weather observers to preserve their natural night vision. To help with the identification of clouds during the day the goggles should be put on just before the observer goes outside. This will ensure the eyes are not affected by the glare from the sun or snow. For use at night the observer should put the goggles on about ten minutes prior to going outside. Once the observer is outside and away from major sources of light the goggles may be removed and the observer's vision should be adapted to the dark. Although the goggles are designed to be worn indoors, some people find walking around inside, especially up and down stairs, to be difficult. At no time should the goggles be used to help assess the visibility. Concept Dark adaptor goggles were invented by Wilhelm Trendelenburg in 1916.Red Goggles (ca. 1940s) The concept is based on the work by Antoine B√©cl√®re on dark adaptation of the eye, where it is noted that fluoroscopy relies on the use of the retinal rods of the eye. Since retinal rods are insensitive to long wavelengths of light, such as red light, while retinal cones are not, the goggles enabled the physicians to adapt their eyes in preparation for the fluoroscopic procedure while still being able to perform other work. Prior to the invention of these goggles, physicians were required to sit in the darkened room where the procedure would be performed for extended periods to adapt their eyes to the low lighting conditions.

They live today in the Tolna and Baranya counties of Hungary, in Hunedoara CountyK√°roly Kocsis, Eszter Kocsisn√© Hodosi, Ethnic Geography of the Hungarian Minorities in the Carpathian Basin, Simon Publications LLC, 1 Apr 2001, p 133 in Romania and in the Serbian province of Vojvodina. Origins Some Sz√©kely groups migrated from Transylvania to the province of Bukovina in the second half of the 18th century and established new villages, where they retained their distinctive culture and folk traditions into the 20th century. The migration was a reaction to the organization by the Habsburg Monarchy of the Sz√©kely Frontier Zone, which jeopardized certain of the Sz√©kelys' ancient privileges and rights. The Sz√©kelys protested specifically against the forced military conscription at a gathering at Mad√©falva (today Siculeni), which was forcibly dispersed by the Austrian General Josef Siskovics on 7 January 1764, in what came to be known as the Siculicidium or Massacre of the Sz√©kelys. More than 400 Sz√©kelys died. Thereafter about 1,000 Sz√©kelys migrated to Bukovina, then part of Moldavia and still under the suzerainty of the Ottoman Empire. Sz√©kely villages in Bukovina The occupation of northern Bukovina by Austria in 1774 brought a further wave of Sz√©kely immigration: another 100 families settled in the still sparsely populated territory in 1776, followed by a further 200 in 1784 and 1786, with assistance from Emperor Joseph II of Austria and Count Andr√°s Hadik, governor of Transylvania. The new Bukovina Sz√©kely villages were named Istenseg√≠ts (\\"God help us\\", now ≈¢ibeni), Fogadjisten (\\"God, welcome us!\\", now ), J√≥zseffalva (now Vornicenii Mari), Hadikfalva (now Dorne»ôti) and Andr√°sfalva (now MƒÉneu≈£i). =Cultural tradition= The Sz√©kelys of Bukovina maintained an archaic Hungarian folklore because of their isolation.Zsuzsanna Palk√≥, Hungarian Folktales: The Art of Zsuzsanna Palk√≥, Univ. Press of Mississippi, 1995, p 13 =Language= Overpopulation The population of the Bukovina Sz√©kelys tripled during the 19th century, reaching 9,887 in 1880 and about 16,000 by the end of the 1930s. This caused an acute shortage of farmland and a sharp fall in standards of living. Many Bukovina Sz√©kelys left the villages temporarily or permanently, some with official assistance. The Hungarian government settled 4,000 of these impoverished Sz√©kelys along the Lower Danube in the new villages of Hertelendyfalva, S√°ndoregyh√°za and Sz√©kelykeve in 1883, in a part of the Banat that was annexed by Yugoslavia in 1918 (nowadays belonging to Serbia). Other Sz√©kely families emigrated in that period to Canada, USA, Brazil, or cities in southern Transylvania. Resettlements Bukovina became part of Romania under the 1920 Treaty of Trianon, and the impoverished Sz√©kelys soon found themselves oppressed culturally as well as economically, with no teaching in or of Hungarian in their schools. There was a general expectation of assistance from the \\"mother country\\" and increasing urgency after the Second Vienna Award of 1940 had caused widespread anti-Hungarian feeling in Bukovina. Hungary's 1941 invasion of Baƒçka (B√°cska) in northwestern Vojvodina was followed quickly by the expulsion of postwar Serbian settlers and other measures of forced Magyarization, including resettlement of the Bukovina Sz√©kelys to the region. The whole community of 13,200 people left Romania under a treaty concluded between Hungary and Romania, by which the Bukovina Sz√©kelys lost their Romanian citizenship and almost all their possessions, receiving the confiscated possessions of displaced Serbs in Baƒçka and some charitable assistance in exchange. They were not resettled in their original village communities as they had expected, but spread about in small groups among 14 villages and hamlets. Those from Andr√°sfalva, for example, belonged to the Reformed Church, while the others were Roman Catholics. The resettlement was short-lived. The tide of war turned and Hungary hurriedly evacuated Baƒçka on 8 October 1944. Most of the Bukovina Sz√©kelys managed to flee to Transdanubia before the vengeful Yugoslav partisan forces arrived, but again, they lost all of their property. Most were resettled in 1945‚Äì46 in the homes of expelled Germans (Danube Swabians) in villages in the V√∂lgys√©g district of Tolna and adjacent counties.N√≥rbert Pap, Tolna ‚Äì a rural area in central-Europe: regional and local development in Tolna country, Hungary, 2007, p. 80 Tensions between them and the residual German population have eased over the decades.

His term was marked by much less controversy than under his predecessor, Lord Goddard. Family and early life Parker was the son of Robert Parker, Baron Parker of Waddington, who had been a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary. He went to Rugby School (which he enjoyed; in later years he was Chairman of the Governors) and Trinity College, Cambridge. He graduated with a double first in Natural Sciences, specialising in geology and intending to go into the oil business. This intention he abandoned on graduating in 1922 to read for the Bar (Lincoln's Inn) where he was called in 1924, entering the chambers of Donald Somervell.D. A. S. Cairns, ‚ÄòParker, Hubert Lister, Baron Parker of Waddington (1900‚Äì1972)‚Äô, rev. Robert Stevens, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2006, accessed 15 Feb 2010. Legal career At the Bar, Parker specialised in commercial cases and developed a courtroom style that tried to be fair to all the arguments and make a case with calmness. In 1945, he became the Junior Counsel to the Treasury (Common Law) (also referred to as the \\"Treasury devil\\"), an appointment which normally led on to promotion to the High Court bench; however, when the invitation came from Lord Jowitt in 1948, Parker thought it was too soon and that he had only just become useful to the Treasury Counsel, and therefore declined. He accepted the second invitation when it came in 1950. As he went straight from being Treasury Devil to the High Court, he never 'took silk' (that is to say, he was not a King's Counsel): the Treasury Devil was never a 'silk'.\\"Lord Parker of Waddington\\" (obituary), The Times, 16 September 1972, p. 14. =Judicial career= As a judge, Parker found himself presiding over trials in areas of the law he was unfamiliar with. He claimed that the first summing up which he gave in a criminal trial was the first he had ever heard. However, by getting down to the work, he eventually mastered the job and by 1954 was promoted to the Court of Appeal. The more measured style of the appellate courts suited Parker more than the cut and thrust of the King's Bench, and his ability to get to the important details of a case was assessed as good by those who appeared before him. He proved that he had reasonable political judgment in 1957 when heading a tribunal over a minor political scandal connected with the setting of interest rates. As Lord Chief Justice Lord Goddard announced his resignation as Lord Chief Justice in 1958. He had been an exception to the tradition that the Attorney General be appointed to the role and some commentators expected that the next appointment would therefore be Sir Reginald Manningham-Buller, Attorney-General at the time. However Manningham- Buller was widely disliked and also shared Goddard's reactionary views on criminal justice. Harold Macmillan considered Viscount Kilmuir, the Lord Chancellor, but Kilmuir rejected the job. Macmillan therefore decided to appoint a senior Judge, and Parker's name emerged as the one candidate with whom most people were happy. On 30 September 1958, Parker took the title Baron Parker of Waddington, of Lincoln‚Äôs Inn in the Borough of Holborn. Parker's style was totally different from Goddard as he confined himself to the higher courts and did not intervene in everyday criminal trials. He had little interest in the social life of the judiciary. He was called upon where a trial had a serious political aspect, and was criticised when he imprisoned journalists who refused to reveal their sources during the Vassall tribunal of 1963. Parker's judgment stated in part \\"the citizen's highest duty is to the State\\". Parker also made history when he sentenced George Blake, convicted of spying, to 42 years imprisonment, the longest sentence then passed in an English court; the conjunction seemed to some to suggest that Parker was too close to the government of the day, though others said Parker had been shocked at the extent of the treachery that had sent dozens of Western agents to their deaths. Parker had himself said that the Courts \\"have a positive responsibility to be the handmaiden of administration rather than its governor\\".\\"Officials And The Rule Of Law\\", The Times, 29 June 1960, p. 8. However, Parker was popular among the profession as he secured improvements in judicial salaries and pensions. Parker was a mild reformer who supported legal aid and tried to modernise some judicial procedures which he thought were antiquated, such as the assize court system. Like Goddard, Parker took an active part in House of Lords debates. The most important speech he made was in debates during the passage of the War Damage Act 1965 which has the effect of retrospectively overturning the judicial decision of the House of Lords in Burmah Oil Co. v Lord Advocate thereby depriving the plaintiff of an award of damages. Parker regarded this as an abhorrent idea in principle, but his view did not carry the day. He supported moves to abolish the death penalty. In 1964 Parker instituted the first 'Sentencing conference' to try to get consistency. In the late 1960s he introduced the first formal training for Judges, and welcomed the formation of the Law Commission. When Lord Beeching headed a committee looking at court reform in 1971, Parker's memorandum was more radical than the committee's recommendations. Death Parker announced his retirement before the committee reported, and died the next year at the cattle farm he ran together with his wife of 48 years.

Instrument maker Giuseppe Campani was born in 1635. He was an Umbrian from Castel San Felice near Spoleto. His lenses and telescopes, made in Rome, were sent as far as Florence and Paris. Campani was known as the best maker of optical instruments of his age. His brother, Matteo Campani-Alimenis, and he were experts in grinding and polishing lenses, especially for very long focal length aerial telescope objectives. His brother is also noted as a mechanician for his work on clocks. He was a priest in charge of a parish in Rome. Louis XIV of France ordered several long-focus lenses (86, 100, 136 feet respectively) for the astronomer Giovanni Domenico Cassini. With these Cassini found several moons of the planet Saturn, among other discoveries. Constantijn Huygens, Jr., brother of Christiaan Huygens, acquired one of Campani's telescopes. While in London in 1689 he ordered a new tube for the instrument from the instrument maker John Marshall. Astronomer Campani made many observations himself. Cassini called his attention to the spots on Jupiter, and he disputed with Eustachio Divini, an Italian optician, the priority of their discovery. His astronomical observations and his descriptions of his telescopes are detailed in the following papers: Ragguaglio di due nuovi osservazioni, una celeste in ordine alla stella di Saturno, e terrestre l'altra in ordine agl' instrumenti (Rome, 1664, and again in 1665); Lettere di G. C. al sig. Giovanni Domenico Cassini intorno alle ombre delle stelle Medicee nel volto di Giove, ed altri nuovi fenomeni celesti scoperti co' suoi occhiali (Rome, 1666). Instruments Campani's entire workshop was donated to the Gabinetto di Fisica of the Academy of Sciences of Bologna Institute in 1747. His telescopes were in length. A telescope by Campani was tested in 1871 and was found to provide good definition and a flat field, with a magnification of about 20 times. A tripod compound monocular microscope made by Campani is held in the Billings microscope collection at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, D.C..

In feature films, Waters played secondary roles such as Craggs in The Blue Lagoon (1949), Mr. West in The Happiest Days of Your Life, Palmer in Chance of a Lifetime and \\"Wings\\" Cameron in The Wooden Horse (all three in 1950). In later years, Waters was briefly seen as the Harbour master in The Wicker Man (1973), and his final film role was as Dr. Jones in Ken Loach's Black Jack in 1979.

St. Mark's was founded in 1865 as an all-boys school by Joseph Burnett, who developed and marketed Burnett Vanilla Extract. Girls have attended since 1978. St. Mark's is a member of the Independent School League, and one of five prep schools known collectively as St. Grottlesex. History St. Mark's is one of the first New England schools founded on the British model, as opposed to academies such as Phillips Academy and Phillips Exeter Academy or entrepreneurial schools such as The Hill School.Preparing for Power: America's Elite Boarding Schools, Basic Books, 1985, Peter W. Clarkson and Caroline Hodges Persell, pg. 43 The school attracted many members of Boston Brahmin and New York Knickerbocker families.St. Mark's School, A Centennial History (Hall, Stinehour Press, Lunenberg, VT, 1967 =Arrival of William Greenough Thayer= The school faced initial challenges, including financial difficulties and the instability resulting from employing four different headmasters in its first seventeen years of existence, followed by the appointment of William E. Peck in 1882. Peck was often in conflict with the trustees, until 1894, when he resigned and founded Pomfret School, taking a number of students and teachers with him. It wasn't until the appointment of Headmaster William Greenough Thayer (who had taught for five years at slightly younger athletic archrival Groton School) in 1894 that St. Mark's began to experience stability. Thayer led the school until 1930. News of his pending retirement was reported by Time Magazine in 1929.Time Magazine, \\"Twill\\" December 2, 1929 Thayer's knack for attracting socially-well-connected families proved durable. His admissions policy, modeled on that of English Public Schools, prioritized admissions on the basis of when one's parents had ‚Äúput one's name down‚Äù. In practice this led over time to a school dominated by sons of alumni. Girls were not admitted until 1978. St. Mark's social standing did not pass unnoticed in wider America. F. Scott Fitzgerald, in his 1920 novel ‚ÄúThis Side of Paradise‚Äù, identified St. Mark's as a school which ‚Äú...recruited from Boston and the Knickerbocker families of New York.‚Äù F. Scott Fitzgerald, This Side of Paradise, (New York, Scribners, 1920) Sports were emphasized. In the early years masters played with boys on the same teams, and the traditional football rivalry with Groton was slowly expanded to include the English game of ‚Äúfives‚Äù, baseball, and other sports. =Parkman period= With Thayer's retirement in 1930, Headmaster Francis Parkman was chosen to lead the school. Parkman brought the noted poet Richard Eberhart to the school as an English teacher from 1933 to 1941, and W. H. Auden for a brief appointment in 1939. Auden described St. Mark's to a friend as a school that \\"sets out to be a sort of American Eton‚Äù. Auden was reportedly struck by the ‚Äúdimness of the boys and the reverence of America for the average.‚ÄùThe Newsletter of the W. H. Auden Society, September 1993, Newsletter No 10-11 Eberhart briefly memorializes Auden's time at St. Mark's with his poem ‚ÄúTo W. H. Auden on his Fiftieth Birthday‚Äù, in which he mentions the school in passing. Parkman left the school in 1942 ‚Äì to enlist in the army ‚Äì and never returned, although he remained active in independent school policy all his life, eventually rising to the presidency of the National Association of Independent Schools in Boston. =World War II= World War II changed the campus. In 1942 Parkman was replaced by William Brewster, an Episcopal clergyman who remained only until 1947. Brewster's democratizing tendencies were abetted by exigencies of the war effort. The school was forced to cope with labor shortages that forced students to work in dormitories and in the dining hall. The maids and domestic help vanished with the war's labor shortage and never returned. =Twentieth-century elitism= Headmaster Brewster disliked the clubby atmosphere of the school, reforming admission policies during his brief tenure. Famously hearing one alumnus describe St. Mark's as the best club he had ever joined, Brewster subsequently fought to make admissions merit-based, and expanded financial assistance. His successors continued this battle. The school began to focus more on academic as opposed to social merits, and by the late fifties was admitting only about one applicant out of five. In 1948, Headmaster William Wyatt Barber, Jr. assumed leadership of St. Mark's. Teaching Ancient Greek and coaching hockey, Headmaster Barber emphasized character building. Under Mr. Barber, the school offered scholarships to students from military or moderate income families. =Challenge of modernization= In 1968, Edward T. \\"Ned\\" Hall became Headmaster. Beginning in the early 1970s, St. Mark's relaxed many traditional, formal requirements of school life. St. Mark's reduced the number of required chapel services from six days per week to five. St. Mark's reduced the number of sit down meals. The School introduced a \\"December Week\\" of alternative course offerings, and experiments in co-education. Headmaster Hall announced his resignation at the beginning of the 1973‚Äì74 school year, effective the following July. In 1974, the trustees hired Rev. Robert R. \\"Red\\" Hansel, a former chaplain at St. George's School. Hansel's four-year tenure was controversial. Changes under Rev. Hansel, like coeducation, were arduous. In 1972 girls initially attended the newly established Southborough School, funded largely by St. Mark's. In 1977 the Southborough girls' school was dissolved. St. Mark's absorbed many of its students and faculty. Academics Age Quod Agis Between 2010 and 2014, the most popular college destinations were Northeastern (12), Georgetown (11), Hamilton (11), Boston College (10), and Lehigh (10). St. Mark's has an average SAT score of 1360.. The revised curriculum eliminated Advanced Placement classes and installed Advanced classes, courses unique to St. Mark's which, depending on the course itself, may or may not align with the College Board's Advanced Placement classes. Programs St. Mark's offers several unique programs to its students and others affiliated with the school. The programs are as follows: * Lion Term * St. Mark's Saturdays * Gray Colloquium * LEO: Official Academic Journal * STEM Fellowship * Global Citizenship * Career Day Facilities Notable in the Thayer vision was the cloister-style construction of the school, with interconnected buildings forming an architectural ensemble in which the entire school was essentially under one roof, in many cases with dorms on the upper floors of the buildings and classrooms and other academic halls in the lower floors. Because of this, the school touts the \\"school under one roof\\" concept as a unique strength, though more recent buildings no longer fit that criterion. The school as it appeared in the early 1950s is portrayed under the name \\"St. Bart's\\" in the novel Pnin by Vladimir Nabokov, whose son Dmitri attended the school. Some interior shots of St. Mark's can be seen in the film School Ties (1992), which was filmed at Middlesex School and St. Mark's. Athletics St. Mark's has historically been strong at ice hockey, and a number of its alumni have gone on to careers in the National Hockey League. The boys' ice hockey team won NEPSAC Championships in 1992, 2015, 2016; ISL Eberhart Division Championships in 1976, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2015, and 2020; ISL Championships in 1981, 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000; and Private School League Championships in 1959, 1960, 1961 and 1962. In 2006 and 2007, St. Mark's boys' cross-country was the New England Division IV Champion, while the girls' cross-country team was the runner-up in 2007. After finishing second in the New Englands in 2008, 2009, and 2010, St. Mark's boys' cross-country had an undefeated season in 2011 and went on to win the ISL Championships and New England Division II Championship. St. Mark's boys' cross-country replicated this feat in 2013, capturing the ISL and New England Championships. St. Mark's has played the Groton School since 1886, making it one of the oldest athletic rivalries in the United States. St. Mark's has educated a few Olympic athletes, including Truxtun Hare in track and field, Suzanne King in cross- country skiing, Scott Young in ice hockey, Greg Brown in ice hockey, and Chris Sahs in rowing. The girls' field hockey team has a history of winning the New England Championships. Teams have won in 1992, 1997, 2012 and 2013. In 1951 and 1954 the Lions were Private School League champions in basketball. St. Mark's also won ISL championships in 1972, 1999, 2006, 2008, 2009, 2011, and 2012, and were New England champions in 1972, 1973, 1999, 2006, 2008, 2009, and 2012.https://blogs.stmarksschool.org/magazine/2015/10/14/308/ Notable alumni St. Mark's educated Robert Lowell and Lost Generation literary figure Harry Crosby, both of whom wrote for the school literary magazine as students. Artist William Congdon began painting there. Henry Demarest Lloyd, a notable nineteenth-century progressive and generally considered the father of investigative journalism, studied at St. Mark's. Astronaut Story Musgrave is an alumnus, but his name was added to the official plaque at a later date. Former CBS news chief and the Nation editor Blair Clark, Washington Post editor Benjamin Bradlee, Harvard professor and Net Impact faculty founder Mark Albion, and more recently comedian Mike Birbiglia, Harvard professor and White House consultant Gregory Ciottone, Motley Fool financial publisher David Gardner, and literary critic Christian Lorentzen are alumni.

He was Assistant Professor at the US Naval Academy in Annapolis and a published specialist on iron and steel as well as steam engines, when he was invited in 1871 by Stevens' president Henry Morton to head mechanical engineering at Stevens. The same year Thurston was appointed the first professor of mechanical engineering at Stevens Institute of Technology.  Biography  Thurston was born 1839 in Providence, Rhode Island, the eldest son of Robert Lawton and Harriet Thurston of Providence. He was trained in the workshop of his father, and graduated from Brown University in 1859.Johnson's Universal Cyclopedia, 1878; cited in: Brown Thurston (1880) Thurston genealogies. Published 1880 by B. Thurston. p, 337-338 Thurston was engaged with the business firm of which his father was senior partner until 1861, when he entered the navy as an officer of engineers. He served during the civil war on various vessels, and was present at the Battle of Port Royal and at the Siege of Charleston. He was attached to the North and South Atlantic squadrons until the close of 1865. In 1865 he was stationed as Assistant Professor of Natural and Experimental Philosophy at the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, where he also acted as lecturer on chemistry and physics. In 1870 he visited Europe, for the purpose of studying the British iron manufacturing districts, and in 1871 was appointed Professor of Mechanical Engineering at the Stevens Institute of Technology. In that year he conducted, in behalf of a committee of the American Institute, a series of experiments on steam boilers, in which, for the first time, all losses of heat were noted, and by condensing all the steam generated, the quantity of water entrained by the steam was accurately noted. Robert Henry Thurston, 1903 In 1873 he was appointed a member of the United States Scientific Commission to the Vienna Exhibition; served upon the international jury, edited the Report of the Commissioners (in which he published his own report on machinery and manufactures), in five volumes, 1875‚Äì6. In 1874 and subsequently he conducted, at the Stevens Institute of Technology, a series of researches on the efficiency of prime movers and machines, and upon the strength and other essential properties of the materials of construction. In 1875, he was appointed a member of the United States Commission on the causes of boiler explosions, and of the Board to test the metals used in construction. He is a member of various scientific associations in the United States, Great Britain, France, and Germany, and has written numerous papers on technical subjects, which have appeared in scientific journals in Europe and America, and has prepared articles upon similar topics for this Cyclopedia. He was made vice- president of the American Institute of Mining Engineers in 1875; he was made vice-president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, at Nashville, in 1877, in the absence of Professor Pickering, elected at the preceding meeting, and was regularly elected to serve again in 1878, at the St. Louis meeting of the association. From 1880 to 1882 Thurston was the first president of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. In 1885 he left the Stevens Institute of Technology to replace John Edison Sweet as director of Sibley College at Cornell University, reorganizing it as a college of mechanical engineering. In 1885, he received an honorary Degree of Engineering from Stevens. He died 1903 in Ithaca, New York.  Work  Thurston's research interest was in the areas of materials, thermodynamics, steam engines and boilers, friction and energetics. = Mechanical engineering curriculum = At the Stevens Institute of Technology he established Stevens' mechanical engineering curriculum. He was committed to the French and German science- based models of technical education and soon would gain an international reputation for his view of engineering as applied science. His enthusiasm in involving students in funded research led to remarkable pioneering success of the early Stevens' graduates. Historians credit Thurston with establishing the first US mechanical engineering laboratory for conducting funded research at an academic institution for higher learning. = The Mechanical Engineer, his Preparation and his Work = The 1874 paper \\"The Mechanical Engineer, his Preparation and his Work\\" according to Popular Science Monthly (1875 8:376) is: :...an address to a graduating class of the Stevens Institute of Technology, by the Professor of Mechanical Engineering. Prof. Thurston, in the first place, recalls to the minds of the young engineers the rare educational advantages they have enjoyed at the Institute: very full instruction in mathematics and physics; in modern languages; the English language and literature; principles of engineering, and the practice of the arts connected therewith. So far, the students have been working at the foundation; the superstructure they must build by their own efforts. The professor exhorts them to be wide-awake, observant, conscientious, true to their clients, progressive, radical in theory but conservative in practice, and diligent in study.Popular Science Monthly. (1875) Volume 8. p.376 (wikisource) = Other papers = Thurston wrote a number of papers embodying accounts of original investigations of the strength and other properties of construction materials. Among his numerous inventions are the magnesium ribbon lamp, a magnesium- burning naval and army signal apparatus, an autographic recording testing machine, a new form of steam engine governor, and an apparatus for determining the value of lubricants. In 1875, he also developed the three-coordinate solid diagram for testing iron, steel, and other metals. = Patents = Thurston held two patents: one for an autographic recording testing machine for material in torsion and the other for a machine for testing lubricants.

His brothers Vincenzo Campi and Antonio Campi were also renowned painters. Biography The eldest of a family prominent painters, Campi was born at Cremona. His father Galeazzo (1475‚Äì1536) taught him the first lessons in art. In 1522, in Mantua, he studied painting, architecture, and modelling under Giulio Romano. He visited Rome, became an ardent student of the antique, and like Bernardino ‚Äî distantly related to him ‚Äî he combined a Lombard and Roman traditions. He collaborated on some works with Camillo Boccaccino, the son of Boccaccio Boccaccino, with whom Campi may also have received training. Campi is called the \\"Ludovico Carracci of Cremona\\" for his influence, since Campi was as influential during the Renaissance in Cremona as the latter was on the Baroque school of Bologna. When he was just twenty-seven Giulio executed for the church of Sant'Abondio his masterpiece, a Virgin and Child with Sts Celsus and Nazarus, a decoration masterly in the freedom of its drawing and in the splendour of its color. His numerous paintings are grandly and reverently conceived, freely drawn, vigorously coloured, lofty in style, and broadly handled. He was animated in all his work by a deep piety. Many of his fresco works are housed in churches of Cremona, Mantua, Milan and in the church of Saint Margaret's, in his native town. Among his chief works are The Chess Game, Descent from the Cross in San Sigismondo at Cremona, and the frescoes in the dome of San Girolamo at Mantua. He was involved in the reconstruction and decoration of the church of Santa Rita in Cremona. An altar-piece in San Sigismondo and his Labours of Hercules were engraved by the celebrated Ghiso, il Mantovano. He died in Cremona in 1572.

The Academy enrolls approximately 400 students in grades nine through twelve, 70% of whom are boarders. The school was established in 1763 and is the oldest continuously operating independent boarding school in the United States.http://www.thegovernorsacademy.org/home/content.asp?section=about%20us History Mansion House, formerly the residence of founding benefactor William Dummer The school was founded two years after the death of William Dummer, who funded it in his will. Dummer had been lieutenant governor and acting governor of Massachusetts for many years, and led the colony through a difficult period in the earlier 18th century: fighting off forays by French and Indians during what became known as Dummer's War in the 1720s. He also served as an early overseer of Harvard College. He was from a prominent colonial family with his brother Jeremiah Dummer having been a principal founding benefactor of the College of New Haven which later became Yale University. As the Boston Latin School only accepted students from the city of Boston, the need arose for schools in more outlying areas to prepare students for college‚Äîthe only ones existing at that time in New England being Harvard and Yale; Brown and Dartmouth were founded a few years afterward. In that context, the Dummer Charity School or Dummer Grammar School commenced operation in 1763 pursuant to the will of Governor Dummer with Samuel Moody as its first headmaster. In 1782, the Dummer school was officially incorporated as the Dummer Academy, whose graduates in this era comprised approximately 25% of the undergraduate student body at Harvard. Most children in this era were home-schooled with pre-college education ending around the age of 14, with youths thereafter going on to college or entering the workforce. Thus most college freshmen tended to be the age of high school freshmen today. As was the custom, the curriculum in this era focused primarily on the study of Scripture, basic math and English and, most importantly, instruction in Latin, Greek, and the Classics. The curriculum broadened over time as the requirements of college admission expanded. Although the academy initially operated in a one-room schoolhouse which still stands to this day, it had access to the grand mansion of the late governor, that remains a central fixture on the campus as the headmaster's residence. Over time other structures were built and the faculty and curriculum expanded so that by the time of the school's centennial in 1863, the Dummer Academy had grown into a well known 19th century prep school that catered mostly to children from affluent families who aspired to the Ivy League. By the turn of the 20th century, however, the school had fallen on hard times, with enrollment and income down, as the school struggled under the shadow of Exeter, Andover, and other schools that had grown to become very well known and prestigious. It was in this context that Dr. Charles Ingham became headmaster in 1908, launching great efforts to revive the Academy. As a result, Dummer Academy became stabilized, and began to again thrive as a premier New England prep school that sent over a third of its graduates to Ivy League colleges during that period. Upon Dr. Ingham's retirement in 1930, Edward \\"Ted\\" Eames became headmaster, a post he held for 30 years. Early in Master Eames' tenure, the name of the school was changed to the Governor Dummer Academy, a title it retained until 2006. With some exceptions, the school primarily was open only to boys until coeducation was established in 1972. Name change In December 2005, the Board of Trustees voted to change the name of the Academy to \\"The Governor's Academy\\" amid concerns that the name \\"Dummer\\" was deterring prospective students from applying. Legally the name remains \\"Governor Dummer Academy\\" doing business as \\"The Governor's Academy.\\" When founded, the Academy was named \\"Dummer Charity School.\\" Subsequently, the name was changed to \\"Dummer Academy,\\" which name it was known by for a century and a half. The decision to change met with resistance from some students and alumni, and attracted media attention from around the country. Those who promoted the change saw it as one of a number of ways to expand the geographic representation and the overall appeal of the school, especially to those who were not familiar with the school or its history. The name change took effect on July 1, 2006. In 2010-2011, the Academy set records for admissions inquiries, interviews and applications, thus supporting the decision that the name change would enhance institutional marketing efforts. Academics Students study in small classes, with a student-to-teacher ratio of 5:1. Advanced Placement courses are offered in nearly 22 subjects, from mathematics and science to art, foreign languages, English and history. Foreign language classes are offered in Chinese, French, Spanish, German and Latin. Eighty-five percent of faculty live on campus and serve as dorm parents and coaches as well as classroom teachers. More than 70% have advanced degrees, with several having earned terminal degrees in science, law, education and medicine. Athletics The Academy is a member of the Independent School League. The school fields 23 varsity teams and 47 interscholastic teams. There are three levels of interscholastic competition offered at The Governor's Academy: varsity, junior varsity, and thirds.

The Academy has performed exceedingly well in recent Boston Globe Scholastic Art Awards competitions, ranking first in total awards in 2010 and second in 2011. In 2012, Academy students won 39 awards in the competition in 4 different art disciplines: ceramics, studio art, photography and film. Governor's artists won 15 Gold Keys, 10 Silver Keys, and 14 Honorable Mentions, making the Academy the most winning independent school in Massachusetts.

The lower (ventral) surface has a mid-ventral ridge bearing multicellular scales that originate as a single row but normally separate into two rows as the thallus widens. The scales are multicellular and hyaline (glassy) in appearance, or violet due to the pigment anthocyanin. Rhizoids are nearly lacking in aquatic forms, but there are usually numerous unicellular rhizoids of two types on the ventral surface. One type is called smooth and the other type is the pegged or tuberculated rhizoids; these help in anchorage and absorption. The inner surface of the smooth rhizoids is smooth while that of the tuberculate rhizoid will have internal cell wall projections. Plants are usually monoicous, and sexual reproduction is by antheridia and archegonia. Asexual reproduction occurs by spores, by fragmentation of the rosettes, and by formation of apical tubers. Spores are large (45 to 200 ¬µ) and formed in tetrads. One of the more than 100 species in this genus is the \\"slender riccia\\" (Riccia fluitans), which grows on damp soil or, less commonly, floating in ponds,MacVicar, Symers M. 1971.

(ILS) is a joint venture with exclusive rights to the worldwide sale of commercial Angara and Proton rocket launch services. Proton launches take place at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan while Angara is planned to launch from the Plesetsk and Vostochny Cosmodrome in Russia.  Ownership  ILS was formed in 1995 as a private spaceflight partnership between Lockheed Martin (LM), Khrunichev and Energia. ILS initially co-marketed non-military launches on both the American Atlas and the Russian Proton expendable launch vehicles. With the Atlas V launch of the SES Astra 1KR satellite on 20 April 2006, ILS had made 100 launches, 97 of which were successful. In September 2006, Lockheed-Martin announced its intention to sell its ownership interests in Lockheed Khrunichev Energia International, Inc. (LKEI) and International Launch Services, Inc. (ILS) to Space Transport Inc. Space Transport Inc. was formed specifically for this transaction by Mario Lemme, who has been a consultant to ILS since its inception and a Board member for more than three years. The transaction between Lockheed Martin and Space Transport Inc. completed in October 2006. Lockheed Martin has retained all rights related to marketing the commercial Atlas vehicle and is continuing to offer Atlas launch services to the worldwide commercial market through its subsidiary, Lockheed Martin Commercial Launch Services, Inc. (LMCLS). ILS, no longer affiliated with Lockheed Martin, continued to market the Proton launch vehicles to commercial clients. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed. All Atlas V launches are now managed by United Launch Alliance, a joint- venture between Lockheed Martin and Boeing (IDS/Defense, Space & Security/Launch Services) formed in December 2006, with all commercial Atlas V launches sub-contracted for ULA by LMCLS. In October 2006, Krunichev spokesman said that the firm was ready to buy the stake being sold by Lockheed Martin. Russian space agency spokesman said that despite that Lockheed is selling its stake to Space Transport, Khrunichev may eventually end up owning it. He expressed the desire of the Russian side to increase its presence in the joint venture. Space Transport Inc, registered in the British Virgin Islands and headquartered in Moscow, denied that it would be selling the stake. In May 2008, Khrunichev State Research and Production Space Center, a Russian company, acquired all of Space Transport's interest and is now the majority shareholder in ILS. ILS will remain an American company and headquarters are currently in Reston, Virginia, near Washington, D.C. where approximately 60 employees are based. In April 2019, Glavkosmos and ILS announced that they will be working closer together in the future, in order to bring \\"pricing squarely in line with our customer's needs...\\" and to jointly work on solutions that facilitate \\"...better products, more services [...] and a capability to implement a broader and more flexible set of strategic launch agreements...\\". ILS' ownership structure remains unchanged and it continues to act independently as an American corporation. Any future change contemplated to change ILS' ownership structure, in place since 2008, would be subject to regulatory approvals.  Proton launches  In May 2008, ILS had a backlog of 22 orders, totaling approximately US$2 billion, and had flown 45 commercial Proton missions since 1996. By June 2009, the backlog had grown to 24 firm missions. The 50th ILS Proton launch took place in early 2009. In January 2014, ILS had an order book of 14 launches worth more than US$1 billion, with up to 6 launches planned for 2014. Most Proton payloads are too massive to launch with the less powerful Falcon 9 v1.1 rocket, and there were no spare Ariane 5 launch opportunities, so Proton customers cannot easily switch to other launchers. However, as of 2018, the Proton rockets had a very low launch rate with no commercial launches in 2018 and two commercial launches in 2019 due to multiple factors including the emergence of new commercial launch providers like SpaceX and a spate of Proton/Breeze M launch failures. In the last few years, most launch contracts for large commercial geostationary satellites ‚Äî which have declined overall as more operators look at smaller spacecraft sizes ‚Äî have gone to SpaceX and Arianespace. Proton flew its last scheduled commercial mission on 9 October 2019, delivering Eutelsat 5 West B and MEV-1 to geostationary orbit.http://russianspaceweb.com/eutelsat5wb- mev1.html  Atlas launches  After October 2006, ILS focused solely on the Proton launch vehicle, so no longer offered Atlas launches. The first Atlas launch was the Atlas IIAS Intelsat 704 launch on 10 January 1995 and the last was the Atlas V Astra 1KR launch on 20 April 2006.  Angara launches  ILS began marketing the Angara rocket to commercial customers in July 2015.

It is on the coast of Essex just north of Blackwater and projects into the North Sea. This area is south of the double estuary of the River Stour and River Orwell at Harwich and just north of the town of Walton-on-the-Naze. It is also the location of the Naze Tower, an 18th century monument. The Naze is a peninsula north of the town. It is important for migrating birds and it has a small nature reserve. The marshes of Hamford Water behind the town are also of ornithological interest, with wintering ducks and brent geese. Many bird watchers visit at migration times. History The Naze takes its name from Viking raiders or settlers. The tall brick tower on the highest point was a light-house, and was built up to its present height in 1796. In the Napoleonic and 1st World Wars it was a naval signal station. In the 2nd World War a Chain Home Low radar station was built on the Naze to track German warships and low=flying aircraft, and extended in 1942 to include the old tower. (Refs; WO series and AVIA 7 and AIR 26 series files at the National Archives, Kew). Threats The Naze is eroding rapidly and threatening the tower and the wildlife. The Naze Protection Society was formed to campaign for erosion controls. The Naze has become popular for school fieldwork into erosion and methods to protect the coast. Protection includes a sea wall, a riprap, groynes and a permeable groyne as well as drainage. Millions of tons of sand have been added to the beach to replenish it and stop the cliff eroding. However, the cliff near Naze Tower is greatly eroded. The cliff is receding fast and within 50 years Naze Tower may have tumbled into the sea like the pill boxes that can be seen on the beach.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on April 9, 1992. The episode was written by Jon Vitti and directed by David Silverman. Kelsey Grammer guest starred as Sideshow Bob for the second time. In the episode, Sideshow Bob ‚Äî Bart's archenemy ‚Äî marries Bart's Aunt Selma. When Bart later realizes that Bob is planning to kill Selma, he prevents the attempted murder and Bob is sent back to prison. \\"Black Widower\\" finished 39th in Nielsen ratings for the week that it originally aired. Reviewers generally enjoyed the episode, and gave Grammer's portrayal of Sideshow Bob particular praise. Plot The Simpsons have dinner with Selma and her new boyfriend, Sideshow Bob, Bart's arch-enemy. While Bob was in prison, he spent every moment plotting his revenge against Bart for exposing his plan to frame Krusty the Clown (\\"Krusty Gets Busted\\"). When Selma replied to his \\"prison pen pal\\" ad, Bob became a model prisoner to earn an early release so he could gain revenge. Bob proposes to Selma and she accepts. He makes an appearance at a Krusty the Clown telethon and they reconcile. Lisa encourages Bart to forgive him, but Bart refuses to believe he is reformed. When Selma discovers that Bob detests her beloved MacGyver, the marriage is nearly called off until Bob takes Homer's suggestion to let Selma watch it alone. Selma reveals that she has no sense of smell or taste after a mishap with a bottle rocket and has cut back on cigarettes, smoking only after meals and episodes of MacGyver. Selma sends the Simpsons a tape of their honeymoon which captures Bob's tirade over the lack of a gas fireplace in their hotel room. While watching MacGyver, Bart realizes that Selma has one hour to live and the Simpsons rush to the hotel room. When Selma retires alone to watch MacGyver, her hotel room explodes. She is unscathed and the Simpsons and the police apprehend Bob. Bart explains how he exposed Bob's scheme. Bob opened the gas valve in the hotel room, knowing Selma would not smell the leak. He left while she watched MacGyver, thinking she would light a cigarette afterwards and cause an explosion. Bob asks why the room still exploded if Bart foiled his plot; Chief Wiggum explains that he absent-mindedly threw a match into the room after smoking a celebratory cigar. Bob, again vowing revenge, is led away by the police. Production alt=A man wearing a cap smiles broadly. \\"Black Widower\\" was written by Jon Vitti and directed by David Silverman. The staff wanted an episode involving a \\"mystery\\", so executive producer Sam Simon approached Thomas Chastain, head of the organization Mystery Writers of America, to help construct the mystery. A number of clues leading up to the revelation at the end were inserted into the script so viewers would be able to solve the mystery on their own. As the episode was being written, the writers had their eyes towards winning an Edgar Award, which is awarded to the best mystery fiction in television and film published or produced in the past year. Despite their efforts, \\"Black Widower\\" did not win an Edgar Award. In the episode, the writers echoed the premise of Wile E. Coyote by having Sideshow Bob unexpectedly insert himself into Bart's life and attempt to kill him. Executive producer Al Jean has compared Bob's character to that of Wile E. Coyote, noting that both are intelligent, yet always foiled by what they perceive as an inferior intellect. For \\"Black Widower\\", director David Silverman updated the character model of Bob to reflect the animation of director Brad Bird. One of Bob's friends from jail seen in the episode is Snake Jailbird. The character first appeared in the season two episode \\"The War of the Simpsons\\" only as \\"Jailbird\\", but his full name was first mentioned in \\"Black Widower\\". The writers gave him the name Snake because of the snake tattoo on his arm, and the character has gone by that name ever since. \\"Black Widower\\" was the second episode Kelsey Grammer guest starred in as the voice of Sideshow Bob. He had previously appeared in the season one episode \\"Krusty Gets Busted\\", in which Bart gets Bob sentenced to jail for framing Krusty for armed robbery. Grammer initially expected Bob to be a one-time role, but it eventually became one of the most popular roles he ever played, as Bob became a recurring character on the show. Grammer bases his Bob voice on theatre actor and director Ellis Rabb. He had once worked for Rabb, whose \\"lamenting tones became [the] foundation for Sideshow Bob\\". Cultural references The Elephant Man. The episode begins with the family, except for Marge, watching a parody of the show Dinosaurs on television. The staff thought Dinosaurs was a knock-off of The Simpsons, so at one point Bart exclaims \\"It's like they saw our lives and put it right on screen,\\" and points at the television screen. Before she reveals to the Simpson family that Selma's new boyfriend is Bob, Patty says there is something \\"disturbing\\" about him, which results in Lisa's imagining him as The Elephant Man. As Bob remembers his time in prison, a scene with him picking up road side trash is seen, referencing the film Cool Hand Luke. The music in the scene is a reference to the soundtrack of the film as well. Bob also remembers winning a Daytime Emmy Award in the \\"Best Supporting Performer in a Children's Program\\" category. In Selma's letters to Sideshow Bob, she refers to him by his prison number, 24601, which is Jean Valjean's prisoner number in the novel Les Mis√©rables. The karaoke song Selma and Sideshow Bob sing as a montage is the Frank/Nancy Sinatra duet of ‚ÄúSomethin' Stupid‚Äù. The reunion between Krusty and Bob at the telethon is a reference to a surprise reunion between former comedy partners Jerry Lewis and Dean Martin on a 1970s telethon.. The telethon logo features an Al Hirschfeld-style caricature of Krusty. \\"Black Widower\\" was the second episode to show Patty and Selma's obsession with the character Angus MacGyver from the television show MacGyver, which has become a recurring joke on The Simpsons. When Sideshow Bob goes into the room to see Selma's corpse, he turns around the chair, only to see Bart sitting in it. Bob turns around and sees Selma in the doorway. These shots, from Bob turning the chair to Selma in the doorway, are a reference to the ending of the film Psycho. The music in the scene, written by composer Alf Clausen, is also a reference to Psycho. In Bart's retelling of the story at the end of the episode, Homer shouts \\"To the Simpsonmobile!\\", a reference to Batman's batmobile. Reception In its original American broadcast, \\"Black Widower\\" finished 39th in Nielsen ratings for the week of April 6‚Äì12, 1992, making The Simpsons the third-highest rated television series on Fox that week, after Married... with Children and In Living Color. In I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn wrote that he considered the episode a \\"terrific show\\", appreciating Grammer's work in particular, and he also enjoyed the Dinosaurs gag and Bob's reaction to McGyver, which he remarked \\"make the whole thing great fun\\". Bill Gibron of DVD Verdict rated the episode 97%, and considered it a \\"timeless treat\\" because of Sideshow Bob's appearance, calling it \\"excellent from beginning to end\\". Nate Meyers of the website digitallyOBSESSED rated the episode a 3(of 5). He felt the episode was \\"not a strong entry to the series\\", noting that \\"the love story between Bob and Selma never seems to play as well as it should\\". Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide remarked that later episodes of The Simpsons seasons were typically of lesser quality than episodes that appeared earlier in a season because of \\"general tiredness and the pressure of creating so many programs\\". However, he found \\"Black Widower\\" an exception, noting that most episodes featuring Sideshow Bob rarely disappoint. Hock Guan Teh of DVD Town applauded Grammer's performance as Sideshow Bob in the episode, saying he could not \\"get over Sideshow Bob¬¥s evil and conniving tone of voice, all delivered in a pseudo-Anglophile accent\\".

Water levels (and hence the level of the water table) will usually be controlled by a system of sluice gates and pumps, allowing the land to become wetter at times of the year when this will improve grass growth. Rhynes represent an early method of swamp or marsh drainage. Large sections of swampland were surrounded by trenches deep enough to drain the water from the encircled mound and leave the land relatively dry. Regular clearing and dredging is necessary to keep the rhynes clear of debris so that they flow freely. Rhynes have been used extensively in the United Kingdom, especially on marshy coastal areas such as the Somerset Levels, and the North Somerset Levels. Other examples in England still exist in the Framilode and Saul area of Gloucestershire, where they drain into either the River Severn or Sharpness Canal, and around Easter Compton, South Gloucestershire. In southeast Wales, they can be found on the Caldicot and Wentloog Levels. Many of them are still in use today. Many rhynes in England and Wales are maintained as part of the water resource management operations of internal drainage boards. The rhynes near Wembdon village have some early references, including Fichet's rhyne in 1579 and the Great or Wildmarsh rhyne in 1705.

Early life Esther Allen Howland, born in Worcester, Massachusetts, was the daughter of Southworth Allen Howland (1800-1882) and Esther Allen Howland (1801-1860). The sister of Charles, Edward, and William Howland. Her mother wrote the cookbook The New England Economical Housekeeper and Family Receipt Book, which was published in 1844 (and for the next ten years) by her father S. A. Howland. Her father, Southworth Howland, operated S.A. Howland & Sons. the largest book and stationery store in Worcester, Massachusetts. Howland graduated from Mount Holyoke College (then Mount Holyoke Women's Seminary) in 1847, just 10 years after its opening. Though Mount Holyoke did not celebrate Saint Valentine's Day, students often secretly exchanged poems elaborately scrawled on sheets of paper. Career Shortly after graduating from Mount Holyoke College at the age of 19, Esther Howland received a valentine from a business associate of her father's. The valentine was decorated with an elaborate fine lace border and cut out ornate flowers that have been colored and pasted on. In the center of the valentine was a small pale green envelope that contained a note with a red border and a verse appropriate for Valentine's Day. At this time elaborate Valentine greeting cards were imported from Europe and not affordable to many Americans. Determined that she could make a better valentine she convinced her father to order her supplies from New York City and England. She made a dozen samples which her salesman brother added to his inventory for his next sales trip for their father's business. Hoping for $200.00 worth of orders, she was elated when he returned with over $5,000 worth of business for her. Howland employed friends and developed a thriving business in Worcester, Massachusetts using an assembly line. In the Howlands Residence on Summer Street a guest bedroom on the third floor was set up for Esther's newly founded business. Esther was in charge of cutting the basic design for the individual valentines while the assembly group was responsible for carefully copying each card. Esther also hired women who had to work from home by preparing a box with all the materials required. A week later they would be picked up by a driver and turned to Esther for their inspection. It's been said according to Howland that her girls were paid \\"liberally\\" and that work was \\"light and pleasant.\\" She also would inspect every card that was produced by her assistants. Her early cards contained short four line verses pasted inside of them much like earlier English valentines. This set-up would eventually become standard for the valentine market. Although valentine's day cards had been available in America for more than half a century before Esther started her business she was the first person to ever commercialize them in America. In 1850 her first advertisement appeared in the Worcester Spy. Soon enough she found herself in the position of a businesswoman. She began to import materials from Germany. She also came up with the idea of using silk and embossing lithograph ornaments. With success brought competition. In order to distinguish her valentines Esther began stamping the letter \\"H\\" on the back of her cards in red ink along with the price and the letters ‚ÄòN.E.V.Co.‚Äô which stood for the name of her company New England Valentine Company. While a simple cards made by her sold only for five cents. Cards that included ribbons, artistic illustrations, hidden doors, gilded lace, and interior envelopes that could hold more secret messages, locks of hair or even engagement rings , sold up to one dollar to fifty dollars. which at the time a considerable amount of money. Esther also created Christmas cards, New Years cards, Birthday cards, Booklets, and May baskets. Esther suffered from a knee injury in 1866 which forced her to be in a wheelchair. In 1870 Esther Howland incorporated her business as the New England Valentine Company she then continued to work from her home until 1879 when she then moved to a factory. During that same year she published The New England Valentine Co.‚Äôs Valentine Verse Book that consisted of thirty-one pages. The book was intended for customers who found a beautiful card but didn't like the verse that was inside. With the book they could choose from a total of 131 verses all printed in red, green, blue, and gold ink and came in 3 different sizes. With their chosen verse they could then paste it over the original verse inside the card that they had bought. In 1879 Esther decided to merge her business with one of her competitors Edward Taft. Her valentines became renowned throughout the United States and she was called \\"The Mother of the American Valentine.\\"Making Valentines: A tradition in America Due to her cards being shipped all over the country her business eventually grossed over $100,000 per year, a considerable sum for that time, and she eventually sold the business to George Whitney in 1880 in order to take care of her sick father. In 1904 Esther fractured a femur and was bedridden for 8 months. She then died in her home at 9 Adams St in Quincy. She is also credited for the introduction of the \\"lift-up\\" valentine. These valentine's consisted of several paper-lace motifs built upon one another in layers. Esther Howland also created many innovations of valentine designs. She introduced the layering of lace, use of thin colored paper, three dimensional accordion effects and a bouquet in which flowers would move to reveal a verse when pulled by a string.

It is employs a variety of tactics including cyber spying to gain access to sensitive information remotely, signals intelligence, and human intelligence. China is also engaged in industrial espionage aimed at gathering information to bolster its economy, as well as monitoring dissidents abroad such as supporters of the Tibetan independence movement and Uyghurs as well as the Taiwan independence movement, the Hong Kong independence movement, Falun Gong, pro-democracy activists, and other critics of the Chinese Communist Party. Method of operation Seal of the Ministry of State Security (China) It is believed that Chinese espionage is aimed at the preservation of China's national security through gaining commercial, technological, and military secrets. It is generally believed that Chinese intelligence agencies operate differently from other espionage organizations by employing primarily academics or students who will be in their host country only a short time, rather than spending years cultivating a few high-level sources or double agents. The use of non-traditional intelligence assets is codified in Chinese law. Article 14 of China's 2017 National Intelligence Law mandates that Chinese intelligence agencies \\"may ask relevant institutions, organizations and citizens to provide necessary support, assistance and cooperation.\\" Honey trapping and kompromat are also common tools of Chinese intelligence services. Much information about the Chinese intelligence services comes from defectors, whom the PRC accuses of lying to promote an anti-PRC agenda. One known exception to this rule is the case of Katrina Leung, who was accused of starting an affair with an FBI agent to gain sensitive documents from him. A U.S. judge dismissed all charges against her due to prosecutorial misconduct. The United States believes the Chinese military has been developing network technology in recent years in order to perform espionage on other nations. Several cases of computer intrusions suspected of Chinese involvement have been found in various countries including Australia, New Zealand, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, India and the United States. In the aftermath of the Shadow Network computer espionage operation security experts claimed \\"targeting Tibetan activists is a strong indicator of official Chinese government involvement\\" since private Chinese hackers pursue economic information only. In 2009, Canadian researchers at the Munk Center for International Studies at the University of Toronto examined the computers at the personal office of the Dalai Lama. Evidence led to the discovery of GhostNet, a large cyber-spy network. Chinese hackers had gained access to computers possessed by government and private organizations in 103 countries, although researchers say there is no conclusive evidence China's government was behind it. Computers penetrated include those of the Dalai Lama, Tibetan exiles, organizations affiliated with the Dalai Lama in India, Brussels, London and New York, embassies, foreign ministries and other government offices, and focus was believed to be on the governments of South Asian and Southeast Asian countries. The same researchers discovered a second cyberspy network in 2010. They were able to see some of the stolen documents which included classified material about Indian missile systems, security in several Indian states, confidential embassy documents about India's relationships in West Africa, Russia and the Middle East, NATO forces travel in Afghanistan, and a years worth of the Dalai Lama's personal email. The \\"sophisticated\\" hackers were linked to universities in China. Beijing again denied involvement. In 2019 Chinese hackers posing as The New York Times, Amnesty International and other organization's reporters targeted the private office of the Dalai Lama, Tibetan Parliament members, and Tibetan nongovernmental organizations, among others. Facebook and Twitter took down down a large network of Chinese bots that was spreading disinformation about the 2019‚Äì20 Hong Kong protests and a months long attack on Hong Kong media companies was traced to Chinese hackers. Facial recognition and surveillance artificial intelligence (AI) technology developed inside China to identify Uyghurs, a Muslim minority, is now used throughout China, and despite security concerns over Chinese involvement in 5G wireless networks, is manufactured and exported worldwide by state owned China National Electronics Import & Export and Huawei to many countries, including Ecuador, Zimbabwe, Uzbekistan, Pakistan, Kenya, the United Arab Emirates, Venezuela, Bolivia, Angola and Germany. American companies and universities such as MIT are partnering with, and Princeton, the Rockefeller Foundation and the California Public Employees' Retirement System are backing, Chinese surveillance and AI start-ups such as Hikvision, SenseTime and Megvii, which sell less expensive versions of Chinese state developed artificial intelligence surveillance systems, although this is being curtailed somewhat due to the companies being declared national security threats and human rights violators by the US, and US-China trade concerns. China invests in American AI startups and is starting to overtake the US in AI investment. In July 2020, in its annual report, Germany‚Äôs domestic intelligence agency, the BfV, warned consumers that personal data they provide to Chinese payment companies or other tech firms such as Tencent, Alibaba and others, could end up in the hands of China‚Äôs government.German intel warns against giving data to Chinese tech firms . WREX. 9 July 2020. Retrieved 10 July 2020 In September 2020, a Chinese company, Shenzhen Zhenhua Data Technology came under the scanner worldwide for its big data and data mining and integration capacities and intentions related to its use. According to the information from ‚ÄúNational Enterprise Credit Information Publicity System‚Äù, which is run by State Administration for Market Regulation in China, the shareholders of Zhenhua Data Information Technology Co., Ltd. are two natural persons and one general partnership enterprise whose partners are natural persons. Wang Xuefeng, who is the chief executive and the shareholder of Zhenhua Data, has publicly boasted that he supports ‚Äúhybrid warfare‚Äù through manipulation of public opinion and ‚Äúpsychological warfare‚Äù. Intelligence activity worldwide =Africa= Ethiopia African Union Conference Centre In January 2018, Le Monde reported that the headquarters of the African Union, which had been constructed by the China State Construction Engineering Corporation, had had its computer systems compromised between 2012 and 2017, with data from AU servers being forwarded to Shanghai. The building's computer system was subsequently removed and the AU refused a Chinese offer to configure the replacement system. Le Monde alleged that the AU had then covered up the hack to protect Chinese interests in the continent. China and the African Union have rejected the allegations. Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn rejected the French media report, saying that he doesn't believe it. Moussa Faki Mahamat, head of the African Union Commission, said the allegations in the Le Monde's report were false. \\"These are totally false allegations and I believe that we are completely disregarding them.\\" =Asia= Cambodia Since at least April 2017, TEMP.Periscope, an advanced persistent threat based in China, has been hacking Cambodian organizations related to the 2018 general election. Targets included the National Election Commission, the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, the Senate of Cambodia, and the Ministry of Economy and Finance. The APT engaged in spear phishing against Monovithya Kem of the Cambodia National Rescue Party, sending messages which impersonated the Cambodian League for the Promotion and Defense of Human Rights. Hong Kong According to Falun Gong media The Epoch Times and Pan-democracy political groups, China has been sending spies into Hong Kong harassing dissents and Falun Gong practitioners. In 2012, according to Oriental Daily, a Chinese security ministry official has been arrested in Hong Kong for suspicion of acting as a double agent for the United States. India India has quietly informed companies to avoid using Chinese-made telecommunications equipment, fearing that it may have spy capabilities embedded within it. Also, India's intelligence service, Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) believes that China is using dozens of study centers that it has set up in Nepal near the Indian border in part for the purposes of spying on India. In August 2011 a Chinese research vessel disguised as a fishing trawler was detected off the coast of Little Andaman, collecting data in a geostrategically sensitive region. The \\"Luckycat\\" hacking campaign that targeted Japan and Tibet also targeted India. A Trojan horse was inserted into a Microsoft Word file ostensibly about India's ballistic missile defense program, allowing for the command and control servers to connect and extract information. The attacks were subsequently traced back to a Chinese graduate student from Sichuan and the Chinese government is suspected of planning the attacks. Chinese hackers linked to the Third Technical Department of the People's Liberation Army have launched extensive and sustained hacking campaigns against the Central Tibetan Administration, based in Dharamshala. In 2018, PLA Navy deployed a Type 815G ELINT ship in waters off Andaman and Nicobar islands for two weeks, according to a report by Indian intelligence agencies. In March 2019, Indian intelligence agencies, told news services that China was trying to spy on Indian Naval bases, located in southern India and Integrated Test Range missile testing facility located at Abdul Kalam Island. It was doing this by establishing Chinese business around these areas. In June 2019, Indian Reconnaissance satellite detected that PLAGF had deployed TARS balloon on strategic bases located in Tibet to gather intelligence on Indian forward bases. In September 2020, Indian police arrested a journalist and accomplices under the Official Secrets Act for allegedly passing sensitive information to Chinese intelligence officers. Japan According to a report by Trend Micro the \\"Luckycat\\" hacker group is engaged in cyber- espionage on targets in Japan, India and Tibet. During the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami and nuclear meltdowns at Fukushima, the hackers inserted a Trojan virus into PDF attachments to emails being circulated containing information about radiation dosage measurements. Investigation into ownership of the command and control servers by Trend Micro and The New York Times linked the malware to Gu Kaiyuan, through QQ numbers and the alias \\"scuhkr\\". Mr. Gu is a former graduate student of the Information Security Institute of Sichuan University in Chengdu and wrote his master's thesis on computer hacking. James A. Lewis of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, believes the attacks were state-sponsored. Kazakhstan On 19 February 2019, Kazakh counterintelligence officers arrested Konstantin Syroyezhkin, a former KGB agent, in Almaty, on charges of passing classified documents to Chinese spies. China linked hackers have also targeted entities in Kazakhstan. Malaysia In 2020 Chinese hackers where implicated in the hacking of Malaysian government official. The attacks where attributed to APT40. The Philippines FireEye President Travis Reese has stated that the Chinese-sponsored Conference Crew, founded in 2016, has engaged in cyber- espionage against the Philippines, targeting diplomatic and national security information. In 2020 Facebook took down a network which was part of a Chinese disinformation campaign against the Philippines. The campaign used false profiles to influence public opinion, particularly related to politics. Singapore Huang Jing (ÈªÑÈùñ), an academic at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, was expelled from Singapore, reportedly for working as an agent of influence for Chinese intelligence services. SingHealth medical data was hacked by suspected Chinese hackers around July 2018. South Korea FireEye claims that two hacker operations tied to the Chinese military, dubbed Tonto Team and Stone Panda/APT10, have attempted to hack the South Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other targets related to the deployment of THAAD. China is reportedly engaged in economic espionage against South Korean technology companies, including Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix. Sri Lanka In 2010, Jayalalithaa Jayaram ‚Äì head of the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam ‚Äì stated that Chinese workers, working in parts of the country devastated by the Sri Lankan Civil War were infiltrated with Chinese spies on surveillance missions targeted at India. In May 2019, Sri Lankan authorities caught former chief of Military intelligence, for allegedly acting as a Chinese mole and trying to obstruct a probe by Indian and American agencies into the Easter bombings. Taiwan Taiwan and China regularly accuse each other of spying. Presidential aide Wang Jen-ping was found in 2009 to have sold nearly 100 confidential documents to China since 2007; Military intelligence officer Lo Chi-cheng was found to have been acting as a double agent in 2010 for China since 2007; Maj. Gen. Lo Hsien-che, electronic communications and information bureau chief during the administration of former President Chen Shui-bian, has been suspected of selling military secrets to mainland China since 2004.United Daily News (11 February 2011). \\"The lost military soul\\" , FocusTaiwan In 2007 the Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau stated that 500 gigabyte Maxtor Basics Personal Storage 3200 hard drives produced by Seagate Technology and manufactured in Thailand may have been modified by a Chinese subcontractor and shipped with the Virus.Win32.AutoRun.ah virus. As many as 1,800 drives sold in the Netherlands and Taiwan after August 2007 were reportedly infected with the virus, which scanned for passwords for products such as World of Warcraft and QQ and uploading them to a website in Beijing. Zhou Hongxu (Âë®Ê≥ìÊó≠), a graduate of National Chengchi University's MBA program, has been accused of attempting to recruit an official from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for the purposes of providing intelligence to China. Zhou was reportedly instructed by China's Taiwan Affairs Office to enroll in the university in order to make friends and develop a spy ring. Zhou reportedly solicited classified documents, offering trips to Japan and United States dollars in payment. In October 2020 it was revealed that Chinese hackers had compromised the largest job bank in Taiwan, hacking the information of over five million people. = Military espionage = In May 2017, Major Wang Hung-ju, a retired military police officer assigned to the National Security Bureau, was indicted on charges of spying for the People's Republic of China. Army Major General Hsieh Chia-kang, deputy commander of Matsu Defense Command, has been accused of providing intelligence to China, having been recruited by retired army colonel Hsin Peng-sheng. In January 2018, it was reported that the Taipei District Prosecutors' Office is investigating if classified information regarding the Airborne Special Service Company was passed on to Zhou Hongxu (Âë®Ê≥ìÊó≠), who was already convicted for violating the National Security Act. In March 2018, a retired colonel was charged with breaching the National Security Act by the Kaohsiung District Prosecutors' Office, which alleged that the colonel shared classified personal information and planned to develop a spy ring in Taiwan. In April 2018, Hung Chin-hsi (Ê¥™ÈáëÈå´), a Macau-born businssman, was accused of developing a spy ring in the Ministry of Justice, on behalf of China. Captain Zhen Xiaojiang (ÈéÆÂ∞èÊ±ü) was convicted in 2015 of recruiting Taiwanese military officers as part of a spy ring on behalf of China, including Army Major-General Hsu Nai-chuan (Ë®±‰πÉÊ¨ä). Zhen sent intelligence regarding Taiwan's radar installations and Dassault Mirage 2000 fighters to China. He was deported to Hong Kong in July 2018. =Economic espionage= Integrated circuit made in Taiwan The Wall Street Journal reported that Taiwan has been \\"ground zero\\" for economic espionage related to integrated circuit fabrication. In a review of ten prosecutions for technology-related thefts in Taiwan, WSJ found that nine of those cases involved technology transfer to China. An employee of Nanya Technology Corp. allegedly stole designs for dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) on behalf of Tsinghua Holdings. Hsu Chih-Peng, an engineer for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., allegedly stole microchip designs after being solicited by the Chinese government-owned Shanghai Huali Microelectronics Coration. According to Taiwanese prosecutors, engineer Wang Yongming (on behalf of Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit) engaged in espionage to steal Micron Technology microchip designs via the Taiwanese company UMC. Micron alleges that UMC hired Micron's engineers, asking them to steal files on advanced memory chips. The files Wang allegedly stole were said to be production secrets, including testing procedures related to metallization, and the DR25nmS design protocol. Vietnam According to the security research firm FireEye, Chinese hackers are suspected of targeting Vietnamese government and corporate targets. The hacking group, designated Conimes, phished the targets and delivered malware via a pre-2012 version of Microsoft Word. =Europe= According to the cyber-security firm Area 1, hackers working for the People's Liberation Army Strategic Support Force compromised the COREU network used for communication by the European Union, allowing for the theft of thousands of low-classified documents and diplomatic cables. In 2019, According to a report released by European External Action Service. There were an estimated 250 Chinese MSS spies operating in capital of European Union. Belgium Belgian Justice Minister Jo Vandeurzen accused the Chinese government of electronic espionage against the government of Belgium, while Foreign Minister Karel De Gucht informed the Belgian Federal Parliament that his ministry was hacked by Chinese agents. The espionage is possibly linked to Belgium hosting the headquarters of NATO and the European Union. The Katholieke Universiteit Leuven in Leuven was also believed to be the center for a group of Chinese students in Europe conducting industrial espionage, operating under a front organization called the Chinese Students' and Scholars' Association of Leuven. In 2005 a leading figure of the Association defected to Belgium, providing information to the S√ªret√© de l‚ÄôEtat on hundreds of spies engaged in economic espionage across Europe. The group had no obvious links to Chinese diplomats and was focused on getting moles into laboratories and universities in the Netherlands, Britain, Germany, France and Belgium. The People's Daily, an organ of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, dismissed the reports as fabrications triggered by fears of China's economic development. In February 2019, a report was released by European External Action Service which estimated that there were 250 Chinese MSS spies operating in Brussels, the capital of European Union. Finland According to the security research firm F5, Chinese hackers launched widespread attacks against Finnish Internet of things computers prior to the 2018 Russia‚ÄìUnited States summit in Helsinki. France There have been several incidents of suspected Chinese spies in France. This includes Shi Pei Pu, a Chinese opera singer from Beijing who convinced a French diplomat that he was a woman, and spied on France.\\"Shi pei pu, singer spy and m butterfly, dies at 70, 1 July 2009\\" The New York Times French media also portrayed Li Li Whuang (ÊùéÊùé), a 22-year-old Chinese intern at car parts maker Valeo, as an industrial spy. Both the French prosecution and Valeo refuted media claims of spying and the case was later considered to be a psychosis. Li Li was ultimately convicted of violating the confidentiality clause of her contract and served two months in prison, but was allowed to continue her doctoral studies at the University of Technology of Compi√®gne. Two French intelligence operatives, identified only as Henri M and Pierre-Marie H, were accused of communicating classified information to China. Henri M was reportedly the Beijing station chief for the Directorate-General for External Security. According to reporting by Le Figaro, the General Directorate for Internal Security and Directorate-General for External Security believe that Chinese spies have used LinkedIn to target thousands of business and government officials as potential sources of information. Germany According to reporting in S√ºddeutsche Zeitung, China has been soliciting information from members of the Bundestag, including offering ‚Ç¨30,000 for insider information from one parliamentarian. Between August and September 2007 Chinese hackers were suspected of using Trojan horse spyware on various government computers, including those of the Chancellory, the Ministry of Economics and Technology, and the Ministry of Education and Research. Germans officials believe Trojan viruses were inserted in Microsoft Word and PowerPoint files, and approximately 160 gigabytes of data were siphoned to Canton, Lanzhou and Beijing via South Korea, on instructions from the People's Liberation Army. The Federal Ministry of the Interior estimates that Chinese economic espionage could be costing Germany between 20 and 50 billion euros annually. Spies are reportedly targeting mid- and small-scale companies that do not have as strong security regimens as larger corporations. Berthold Stoppelkamp, head of the Working Group for Economic Security (ASW), stated that German companies had a poor security culture making espionage easier, exacerbated by the absence of a \\"strong, centralized\\" police command. Walter Opfermann, a counter-intelligence expert for the state of Baden-W√ºrttemberg, claimed that China is using extremely sophisticated electronic attacks capable of endangering portions of critical German infrastructure, having gathered sensitive information through techniques such as phone hacking and Trojan emails. In November 2018, German prosecutors in Cologne charged a former employee of Lanxess for engaging in industrial espionage on behalf of a Chinese copycat company. Germany suspects China of spying both on German corporations and on Uyghur expatriates living in the country. In 2011, a 64-year-old German man was charged with spying on Uyghurs in Munich between April 2008 and October 2009. Munich is a center for expatriate Uyghurs, and in November 2009 members of the Federal Criminal Police Office arrested four Chinese nationals on charges of spying on Uyghurs. In 2007 Chinese diplomat Ji Wumin left Germany after being observed meeting with individuals engaged in surveillance of Munich Uyghurs, and German investigators suspect China is coordinating espionage activities out of its Munich consulate in the Neuhausen district. In 2017, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV) published information alleging that Chinese intelligence services had created fake social media profiles on sites such as LinkedIn, using them to gather information on German politicians and government officials. The Verfassungsschutz had previously warned that Chinese intelligence officers are making use of social networking sites such as LinkedIn and XING to recruit informants. Lu Kang of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs denied the allegations. Lithuania Lithuanian intelligence agencies have claimed that China is engaged in an \\"increasingly aggressive\\" campaign of espionage, which includes \\"attempts to recruit Lithuanian citizens\\". Darius Jauniskis, Director of the State Security Department of Lithuania, has cautioned against a potential threat posed by Huawei telecommunications equipment. Norway Hackers working as part of APT 10, on behalf of the Chinese government, hacked Norwegian business software provider Visma, reportedly to gain access to the information on the company's customers. Beginning on 30 August 2018, APT10 used a malware program dubbed Trochilus and accessed a backdoor, and then proceeded to use WinRAR and cURL to exfiltrate data from Visma to a Dropbox account. Poland In May 2009, Stefan Zielonka, a Polish cipher officer working for the Military Information Services, disappeared. He is suspected of providing the Chinese or Russian governments with Polish and NATO cryptography information. Zielonka's body was later retrieved from the Vistula river, although investigators remain uncertain as to whether Zielonka was attempting to defect or committed suicide, or whether the body retrieved actually was Zielonka's. In April 2018, a former member of the Parliament of Poland for Samoobrona, Mateusz Piskorski, was charged with espionage on behalf of Russia and China. In January 2019, the Huawei sales director for Poland, identified as Weijing Wang (a.k.a \\"Stanislaw Wang\\") was arrested, along with a former senior agent of the Agencja Bezpiecze≈Ñstwa Wewnƒôtrznego (ISA) named Piotr Durbajlo, on suspicion of espionage. Wang was educated at the Beijing Foreign Studies University and studied Polish in ≈Å√≥d≈∫, and subsequently worked as a cultural attach√© at the Chinese consulate in Gda≈Ñsk. Wang joined Huawei's Enterprise Business Group in 2017. Durbajlo worked at the Military University of Technology, working on telecommunications security projects. After retiring from the ISA, he began working as a consultant for Orange Polska. Russia In December 2007, Igor Reshetin, the Chief Executive of Tsniimash-Export, and three researchers were sentenced to prison for passing on dual-purpose technology to the Chinese. Analysts speculated that the leaked technology could help China develop improved missiles and accelerate the Chinese space program. In September 2010, the Russian Federal Security Service detained two scientists working at the Baltic State Technical University in Saint Petersburg. The two are charged with passing on classified information to China, possibly through the Harbin Engineering University. Russia has been a significant target for China linked hackers. In February 2020, the FSB detained Dr. Valery Mitko, President of Russia's Arctic Academy of Sciences, on charges of providing classified information related to underwater detection of submarines to Chinese intelligence operatives. Switzerland According to reports in Neue Z√ºrcher Zeitung, Chinese intelligence services have attempted to recruit Swiss university staff and researchers using LinkedIn. Sweden Babur Maihesuti, a Chinese Uyghur who became a Swedish citizen was arrested for spying on the Uyghur refugee communities in Sweden, Norway, Germany and the United States, and ultimately sentenced for illegal espionage activity. In April 2018 Sweden charged Dorjee Gyantsan, a 49-year-old Tibetan refugee, with spying on Tibetan dissidents and refugees in Sweden between July 2015 and February 2017. Gyantsan is accused of collecting information on Tibetan refugees in Sweden, and then passing that information on to Chinese officials in Finland and Poland. Gyantsan was arrested upon returning from Warsaw, carrying $6,000 in cash. United Kingdom UK officials, including experts at its MI5 intelligence agency, are fearful that China could shut down businesses in the nation with Chinese cyberattacks and spy equipment embedded in computer and telecommunications equipment.\\"Spy chiefs fear Chinese cyber attack\\" , The Times, 29 March 2009\\"MI5 alert on china's cyberspace spy threat\\" , The Times, 1 December 2007 MI5 has reportedly monitored Chinese espionage against Rio Tinto Group computers. According to Robert Hannigan, former Director of the Government Communications Headquarters, Chinese hackers have engaged in economic espionage against British universities and engineering companies, on behalf of the Chinese government. From 1 October 2020, the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office of the British Government expanded the remit of its security vetting for overseas applicants who want to study subjects relating to national security, amid concerns about the theft of intellectual property. The Times said in a report that the measures are expected to block hundreds of Chinese students from entering Britain. Vatican City According to an investigation by Recorded Future, Chinese hackers broke into the computer networks of the Vatican and the Holy See's Study Mission to China, including by placing malware in what appeared to be a letter from Cardinal Secretary of State Pietro Parolin. In the weeks after the investigation was published the hackers continued to operate on Vatican networks. =North America= Canada Newspapers have estimated that China may have up to 1,000 spies in Canada. The head of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service Richard Fadden in a television interview was assumed to have implied that various Canadian politicians at provincial and municipal levels had ties to Chinese intelligence. In an interview, he claimed that some politicians were under the influence of a foreign government, but he withdrew the statement a few days later. It was assumed by Chinese groups in Canada, and others, that he was referring to China because in the same interview he stressed the high level of Chinese spying in Canada, however Fadden did not say specifically which country these politicians were under the influence of. His statement was withdrawn a few days later. In 2005, Canadian businessman Joe Wang stated his belief that threatening letters he received after broadcasting programs about alleged human rights abuses in China were from the Chinese consulate; one of the envelopes contained boric acid. In 2012 Mark Bourrie, an Ottawa-based freelance journalist, stated that the State Council- run Xinhua News Agency asked him to collect information on the Dalai Lama through their Ottawa bureau chief, Dacheng Zhang, by exploiting his journalistic access to the Parliament of Canada. Bourrie stated that he was asked to write for Xinhua in 2009 and sought advice from the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS), but was ignored. Bourrie was asked to collect information on the Sixth World Parliamentarians' Convention on Tibet at the Ottawa Convention Centre, although Xinhua had no intention of writing a story on the proceedings. Bourrie stated that at that point \\"We were there under false pretenses, pretending to be journalists but acting as government agents.\\" Xinhua collects extensive information on Tibetan and Falun Gong dissidents in Canada, and is accused of being engaged in espionage by Chinese defector Chen Yonglin and Reporters Without Borders. On 1 December 2013, Lloyd's Register employee Qing Quentin Huang was arrested and charged with violating the Security of Information Act, for allegedly communicating classified information on the federal shipbuilding strategy to China. Huang reportedly contacted the Chinese Embassy in Ottawa in an attempt to pass on secrets, which was detected by the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, who in turn alerted the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Between 2006 and 2010 Yang Wang, a Chinese immigrant to Canada, admitted to providing intelligence to the Ministry of State Security, including on the activities of Falun Gong. Around June 2014, the National Research Council was reportedly penetrated by Chinese state-sponsored hackers. United States Delta IV Heavy in 2018 F-15 Eagle China is suspected of having a long history of espionage in the United States against military and industrial secrets, often resorting to direct espionage, exploitation of commercial entities, and a network of scientific, academic, and business contacts. Several U.S. citizens have been convicted for spying for China. Naturalized citizen Dongfan Chung, an engineer working with Boeing, was the first person convicted under the Economic Espionage Act of 1996. Chung is suspected of having passed on classified information on designs including the Delta IV rocket, F-15 Eagle, B-52 Stratofortress and the CH-46 and CH-47 helicopters. The U.S. Department of Justice investigation into the fund-raising activities had uncovered evidence that Chinese agents sought to direct contributions from foreign sources to the Democratic National Committee (DNC) before the 1996 presidential campaign. The Chinese embassy in Washington, D.C. was used for coordinating contributions to the DNC.Woodward, Bob and Duffy, Brian, \\"Chinese Embassy Role In Contributions Probed\\" , The Washington Post, 13 February 1997 China's espionage and cyberattacks against the US government and business organizations are a major concern, according to the seventh annual report (issued September 2009) to the US Congress of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission. \\"Although attribution is a problem in cyber attacks, the scale and coordination of the attacks strongly indicates Chinese state involvement,\\" said commission vice chairman Larry Wortzel. \\"In addition to harming U.S. interests, Chinese human and cyber espionage activities provide China with a method for leaping forward in economic, technological, and military development.\\" The report cited that the number of cyberattacks from China against the US Department of Defense computer systems had grown from 43,880 in 2007 to 54,640 in 2008, a nearly 20 percent increase. Reuters reported that the Commission found that the Chinese government has placed many of its computer network responsibilities under the direction of the People's Liberation Army, and was using the data mostly for military purposes. In response, China slammed the report as \\"full of prejudice,\\" and warning it could damage China-US relations. \\"We advise this so-called commission not to always view China through tinted glasses,\\" Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang said. In 2008 the Chinese government was accused of secretly copying information from the laptop of Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez during a trade mission to Beijing in order to gain information on American corporations. The allegations were subsequently dismissed by Qin Gang, a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China. In November 2005 the United States arrested four people in Los Angeles on suspicion of being involved in a Chinese spy ring. Taiwanese- American scientist Wen Ho Lee (born in Nantou, Taiwan 21 December 1939) was accused and investigated on the grounds of espionage in 1999 but was acquitted of all charges except for mishandling classified data.\\"Indictment of Wen Ho Lee\\" In response to these and other reports of cyberattacks by China against the United States, Amitai Etzioni of the Institute for Communitarian Policy Studies has suggested that the United States and China should agree to a policy of mutually assured restraint with respect to cyberspace. This would involve allowing both states to take the measures they deem necessary for their self-defense while simultaneously agreeing to refrain from taking offensive steps; it would also entail vetting these commitments.Etzioni, Amitai, \\"MAR: A Model for US-China Relations,\\" The Diplomat, 20 September 2013, . In June 2015, the United States Office of Personnel Management (OPM) announced that it had been the target of a data breach targeting the records of as many as four million people. Later, FBI Director James Comey put the number at 18 million. The Washington Post has reported that the attack originated in China, citing unnamed government officials. James Comey said: \\"It is a very big deal from a national security perspective and from a counterintelligence perspective. It's a treasure trove of information about everybody who has worked for, tried to work for, or works for the United States government.\\"\\"Hacks of OPM databases compromised 22.1 million people, federal authorities say \\". The Washington Post. 9 July 2015. The Voice of America reported in April 2020 that \\"U.S. intelligence agencies concluded the Chinese hackers meddled in both the 2016 and 2018 elections\\" and \\"Internet security researchers say there have already been signs that China-allied hackers have engaged in so-called \\"spear-phishing\\" attacks on American political targets\\" ahead of the 2020 United States elections. In 2019, two Chinese nationals were indicted for the Anthem medical data breach. About 80 million company records were hacked, stoking fears that the stolen data could be used for identity theft. In February 2020, the United States government indicted members of China's PLA for hacking into Equifax and plundering sensitive data as part of a massive heist that also included stealing trade secrets. Private records of more than 145 million Americans were compromised in the 2017 Equifax data breach. In July 2020, FBI Director Christopher A. Wray called China the \\"greatest long-term threat\\" to the United States. He said that \\"the FBI is now opening a new China-related counterintelligence case every 10 hours. Of the nearly 5,000 active counterintelligence cases currently under way across the country, almost half are related to China.\\" In July 2020, the United States department of justice indicted two Chinese hackers with global computer intrusion campaign targeting intellectual property and confidential business information, including COVID-19 research. It alleged that the two hackers worked with the Guangdong State Security Department of the Ministry of State Security (China). =Oceania= Australia Former Department of Defence Secretary Dennis Richardson has stated that China is engaged in extensive espionage against Australia, and included surveillance of Chinese Australian communities. Australia believes that the Chinese government have been spying on Australian businesses. A male Chinese student from Fujian was granted a protection visa by the Refugee Review Tribunal of Australia after revealing that he had been instructed to spy on Australian targets in exchange for an overseas scholarship, reporting to the Ministry of State Security. Reported targets included Chinese students with anti-Communist sentiments and Falun Gong practitioners. Nicola Roxon, the Attorney-General of Australia, blocked the Shenzhen-based corporation Huawei from seeking a supply contract for the National Broadband Network, on the advice of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. The Australian government feared Huawei would provide backdoor access for Chinese cyber espionage. The Chinese government is suspected of orchestrating an attack on the email network used by the Parliament of Australia, allowing unauthorized access to thousands of emails and compromising the computers of several senior Australian politicians including Prime Minister Julia Gillard, Foreign Minister Kevin Rudd, and Minister of Defense Stephen Smith. Sheri Yan and Roger Uren were investigated by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation on suspicion of spying for China. Oren, former Assistant Secretary responsible for the Asia section of the Office of National Assessments, was found to have removed documents pertaining to Chinese intelligence operations in Australia, and kept them in his apartment. Yan was suspected of undertaking influence operations on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party, and introducing Colonel Liu Chaoying, a military intelligence officer, to Australian contacts. Hackers either working for or on behalf of the government of China are suspected as being responsible for a cyber-espionage attack against an Australian defense company. Designated APT Alf by the Australian Signals Directorate, the hackers stole approximately 30 gigabytes of data on projects including the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, the P-8 Poseidon, the C-130 Hercules and the Joint Direct Attack Munition. APT Alf used a remote access tool dubbed \\"China Chopper\\". In 2017, Chinese hackers infiltrated the computers of Australian National University, potentially compromising national security research conducted at the university. In 2015, Chinese hackers infiltrated the Bureau of Meteorology. New Zealand Jian Yang, a member of the New Zealand House of Representatives, was investigated by the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service as a possibly spy due to his links to Chinese military and intelligence schools. Yang reportedly failed to declare that he had taught at the Air Force Engineering University or the Luoyang People's Liberation Army University of Foreign Languages, which are commonly used as training grounds for Chinese intelligence officers. Yang has denied the allegations that he is a spy. On 15 September, the Stuff media company reported that the Chinese data intelligence company Zhenhua Data had collected open source data intelligence on 730 New Zealand politicians, diplomats, academics, business executives, sportspersons, judges, fraudsters and their families including Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, former Prime Minister John Key's son Max, former Finance Minister Ruth Richardson, and sportsperson Barbara Kendall. Ten percent of Zhenhua Data's database had been leaked to American academic Chris Balding, who then passed the material to Canberra-based cybersecurity firm Internet 2.0. =South America= In 2009 experts believed that China had recently increased its spy capabilities in South America, perhaps with help from the Cuban government. Peru The computer security firm ESET reported that tens of thousands of blueprints were stolen from Peruvian corporations through malware, which were traced to Chinese e-mail accounts. This was done through an AutoCAD worm called ACAD/Medre.A, written in AutoLISP, which located AutoCAD files, at which point they were sent to QQ and 163.com email accounts in China. ESET researcher Righard Zwienenberg claimed this was Chinese industrial espionage. The virus was mostly localized to Peru but spread to a few neighboring countries before being contained. =Social media= In June 2020, Twitter shut down 23,750 primary accounts and approximately 150,000 booster accounts which were being used by China to conduct an information operation aimed at boosting China's global position during the COVID-19 outbreak as well as attacking traditional targets such as Hong Kong pro-democracy activists, Guo Wengui, and Taiwan. Twitter said that the accounts had pushed deceptive narratives and spread propaganda. In August 2020 Google removed over 2,500 channels on YouTube which they suspected of spreading disinformation for China. The deleted channels mostly featured content in Chinese and included coverage of divisive issues like Black Lives Matter.

Goswell, Halstead and McCutcheon previously played in Thames Valley shoegazing band Slowdive. History The band initially existed as a trio, consisting of Halstead, Goswell, and McCutcheon. After Slowdive were dropped by Creation Records, the trio decided to change musical direction to a dream pop/country rock/folk music style, and were signed by 4AD Records. They took on the new name \\"Mojave,\\" but upon the discovery of another band already using the name, the \\"3\\" was added (in reference to the group's three members). Rowe (formerly of Chapterhouse) and Forrester joined shortly after the release of their first album. Both Halstead (the main songwriter for the band) and Goswell have released solo albums, also for 4AD. McCutcheon founded and is currently playing with his band called The Loose Salute who are signed to Heavenly Records and Graveface Records. In 2006, Mojave 3 did a Take-Away Show session with Vincent Moon. Halstead said the band was on hiatus as of 2008, but were planning to release at least one more album in the future. The band returned to playing live in 2011, including gigs supporting Band of Horses . During a radio interview on Israeli radio station Kol HaCampus on 7 May 2011, Halstead said the band were working on new material, and may be recording during the summer, however, nothing materialized.

He has become one of the outstanding Chilean literary voices, gradually becoming a cult writer. In 2005, Mathieu Lindon wrote about him in the French paper Lib√©ration: ‚ÄúThere is, dans Les naufrag√©s (French translation of El naufragio de la luz), not properly an atmosphere and tone, but a strategy of rising malaise, which reminds both Julian Grack and Marie NDiaye‚Äù, and the Swiss paper ‚ÄúLa Tribune de Gen√®ve‚Äù compared him with Joseph Conrad. In 2004 Hern√°n Neira, interviewed by the Chilean paper El Mostrador, considered himself as ‚Äúoutsider‚Äù. His first short-stories book, A golpes de hacha y fuego (By blows of axe and fire, Editorial Andr√©s Bello Santiago, 1995) was unanimously welcome. As a philosopher, his main research areas are political philosophy, animal ethics and literary aesthetics.

He collaborated with Paul Simon and Ladysmith Black Mambazo on Simon's Graceland (album) project in 1985, and became founding member of the Cannibals in the 1970s. When the Cannibals disbanded Ray founded Stimela, with whom he conceived gold and platinum-selling albums like Fire, Passion and (1984), Look, Listen and Decide (1986). Career Ray Phiri was born near Nelspruit in the then Eastern Transvaal, now Mpumalanga Province, in South Africa. In 1985, Paul Simon asked Ray along with Ladysmith Black Mambazo and other South African musicians to join his Graceland project, which was successful and also helped the South African musicians to make names for themselves abroad. Phiri was to collaborate with Simon again on Simon's Rhythm of the Saints album, which saw him perform in over 30 nations during 1990 and 1991, including Paul Simon's Concert in the Park (August 1991, Central Park) and New York's Madison Square Garden, as well as appearing on Saturday Night Live and other top television shows in the United States. The tour concluded in early 1992 with concerts staged in South Africa at venues in Johannesburg, Cape Town, Port Elizabeth and Durban. In 2012 Simon organised a European Graceland 25th Anniversary Tour in which Phiri also contributed his voice, guitar and leadership. In a 2011 interview with The Sunday Times Phiri said that there was \\"bad blood\\" between him and Simon. Phiri maintained that Simon never gave him credit for the songs he had written for Graceland, and that Ladysmith Black Mambazo \\"hardly got any royalties\\". But he added: \\"maybe I wouldn't have been able to handle all that wealth. I sleep at night, I have my sanity and I enjoy living. The big rock 'n' roll machine did not munch me.\\" Personal life and death Phiri was involved in a series of car accidents which affected his personal life and musical career. Phiri was badly injured in 1987 in a crash that claimed the lives of his band manager and six others. In 2003, his wife was killed in a car accident, but Ray escaped serious injury. Phiri was diagnosed with lung cancer and died at the age of 70 on 12 July 2017 at a Nelspruit hospital. A memorial service for Phiri was held at the Mbombela Stadium in Nelspruit on 20 July, and the funeral service took place at the same venue on 22 July. Achievements Phiri has received many awards in recognition for his contribution in the music industry, one of these is the Order of Ikhamanga in Silver awarded to him by the South African president. This was to honor his sterling contribution to the South African music industry and the successful use of arts as an instrument of social transformation.

Population (2006): 59,920. It comprises 5 neighbourhoods: Neufch√¢tel-Est, Lebourgneuf, Duberger, Les Saules and Vanier. Except for Vanier, all of these neighbourhoods were part of the pre-2002 city of Quebec. Description Les Rivi√®res is one of the six boroughs of Quebec City. It takes its name from the Saint-Charles River that passes through the borough as well as two tributaries rivers of Saint-Charles: Berger and Lorette. The borough is geographically located in the centre of Quebec City and contains the Galeries de la Capitale shopping centre. Les Rivi√®res borough vastly corresponds to the Rivi√®res section of the former city of Qu√©bec (Qu√©bec City as it was known before the 2002 municipal reorganization). The borough also include the former city of Vanier which was merged into Quebec City in 2002. The Rivi√®res section of the former city was made of four municipalities that were annexed to Quebec City in the 1970s. They were Duberger, Les Saules, Neufch√¢tel and Charlesbourg- Ouest. These former municipalities kept their respective name as neighbourhoods of Quebec City with the exception of Charlesbourg-Ouest which was renamed Lebourgneuf. Lebourgneuf got its name as a portmanteau from the last letters of Charlesbourg and the first letters Neufchatel because Charlesbourg-Ouest was located between Charlesbourg and Neufch√¢tel. Following the creation of the new city of Quebec in 2002, Neufch√¢tel was dismantled, with most of it going to La Haute-Saint-Charles borough. The part of Neufch√¢tel that was retained by Les Rivi√®res borough became Neufch√¢tel-Est. The borough is mostly an industrial area with a few residential neighbourhoods (Vanier, Duberger and Les Saules.) In recent years the population has increased following a large amount of residential development, particularity the construction of condos along Boulevard Robert-Bourassa.

It was then collected into three bound volumes by Futabasha, released between August 18, 1985 and October 24, 1986. The series was licensed for an English-language release by Viz Media and published in North America starting in 1990. 2001 Nights is largely inspired by classic hard science fiction, with many visual homages to previous science fiction novels and films.  Media  = Manga = 2001 Nights consists of several loosely connected short stories, all taking place in the same timeline, with the whole series spanning several hundred years. Many of the stories are related to each other (even across books), each building upon the achievements of the previous ones. The stories are often (but not always) scientifically plausible, recalling a lot of the early science fiction of the 1950 and 1960 eras. = Anime =  2001 Nights  2001 Nights was adapted into a one-episode original video animation (OVA) under the name Space Fantasia 2001 Nights by TMS Entertainment and released on VHS on June 21, 1987. It has not been licensed in English, though versions with English subtitles can be found.  TO  Two stories from 2001 Nights, Night 12 (\\"Symbiotic Planet\\") and Night 14 (\\"Elliptical Orbit\\") respectively, were adapted into TO, a two-episode computer animation (CGI) original video animation (OVA). Fumihiko Sori directed. It was released on DVD and Blu-ray by Avex in December 2009, in Japan. TO was released on rental DVDs on October 2, 2009 and in December 2009 as regular DVD and Blu-ray release. It was scheduled to air on TBS and BS-TBS (Japanese satellite TV broadcaster) in November and December 2009, prior to the DVD and Blu-ray release. A 10-minute trailer was released on YouTube by Avex on November 11, 2009. Manga Entertainment a UK distributor acquired licensing in late 2010.Funimation licensed To for North American release in 2011. Stories The stories that make up the complete manga are placed in chronological order, with two exceptions. By the technology used, Night 14 (\\"Elliptical Orbit\\") seems to belong somewhere between Nights 6 and 7 (after the invention of suspended animation and interstellar travel, but before the Lucifer discovery). The second, Night 6 (\\"Discovery\\") is referenced in Night 4 (\\"Posterity\\") which occurs 20 years after the launch of the probe Discovery. Reception Reviewing the manga Mark Aragona praised Hoshino's skill in striking a balance between the scientific and the fantastical elements in his stories, noting the opus of Lucifer Rising.

Life and career Bowers was born in Springfield, Massachusetts, the son of Samuel Dwight Bowers and Martha Wheaton Dowd. On both sides, his ancestors were Puritans who had settled in New England more than two centuries before his birth. His family moved to Brooklyn, New York, and later to Elizabeth, New Jersey, where he was tutored privately in preparation for college. Entering Yale in 1875, he graduated valedictorian of his class in 1879, where he was a member of Skull and Bones. For one year he remained a graduate student, then traveled in Europe, and despite an offer to teach at Yale University, he turned to the law profession. He graduated from the Columbia Law School, was admitted to the New York bar, and received a clerkship from a leading firm in New York City in 1882. His efforts earned him the position of managing clerk in one year, and in 1884 he became a member of the firm. Ill health compelled him to rest, and as a result of travel to the Northwest he moved to Winona, Minnesota in October 1884. There he formed a partnership with Thomas Wilson, former chief justice of the Minnesota Supreme Court, where he practiced law until 1893. He then became the general counsel of the Chicago & North Western Railway Company, one of the great railway systems of the country, and in this office he served until 1909, when he was appointed by President Taft, an intimate friend since college and fellow Bonesman, Solicitor General of the United States. The years of his work with the North Western were a period of extraordinary industrial development. Incidentally to this development litigation arose involving federal control of the railroads under the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887, the powers of the states to control intrastate commerce and to tax corporations, and the Sherman Anti-Trust Act of 1890. Bowers success in winning cases for the government during his brief service as solicitor general was phenomenal. He found great joy, as solicitor general, in the fact that he could act solely as lawyer, rather than counsel, and for the whole country rather than for a special interest. Only his death prevented his nomination by President Taft for appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court. He retained throughout his life a catholicity of intellectual interests, particularly in literature. Art and music, in his later years, also became avid interests. Notwithstanding some reserve, his charm of manner, marked by kindly sympathy, easily won him friends. He married twice; first on September 7, 1887 to Louisa Bennett Wilson of Winona, Minnesota, who died on December 20, 1897; and second in 1906 to Charlotte Josephine Lewis of Detroit, who survived him after his death, aged 51. Lloyd and Louisa's daughter Martha Wheaton Bowers married Robert Alphonso Taft, elder son of President William Howard Taft and Helen Louise \\"Nellie\\" Herron He left no published works.

Life He was born at Navia (Asturias) on September 24, 1817. Abandoning his first intention of entering the Jesuit order, he studied medicine at Madrid, found an opening in politics as a supporter of the Moderate party, and, after occupying several subordinate posts, became governor of Castell√≥n de la Plana, of Alicante and of Valencia. Campoamor identified with the moderate liberalism of his day, repudiating both revolution and reaction equally. His first appearance as a poet dated from 1840, when the Madrid Lyceum of Art and Literature published his Ternezas y flores, a collection of idyllic verses, remarkable for their technical excellence. His Ayes del Alma (1842) and his F√°bulas morales y politicas (1842) sustained his reputation, but showed no perceptible increase of power or skill. An epic poem in sixteen cantos, Col√≥n (1853), is no more successful than modern epics usually are. Campoamor's theatrical pieces, such as El Palacio de la Verdad (1871), Dies Irae (1873), El Honor (1874) and Glorias Humanas (1885), are interesting experiments; but they are totally lacking in dramatic spirit. He always showed a keen interest in metaphysical and philosophic questions, and defined his position in La Filosofia de las leyes (1846), El personalismo, apuntes para una filosof√≠a (1855), La metaf√≠sica limpia, fija y da esplendor al lenguaje (1862), Lo Absoluto (1865) and El Ide√≠smo (1883). These studies are chiefly valuable as embodying fragments of self-revelation, and as having led to the composition of those doloras, humoradas and pequenos poemas, which the poet's admirers consider as a new poetic species. The first collection of Doloras was printed in 1846, and from that date onwards new specimens were added to each succeeding edition. It is difficult to define a dolora. One critic has described it as a didactic, symbolic stanza which combines the lightness and grace of the epigram, the melancholy of the endecha, the concise narrative of the ballad, and the philosophic intention of the apologue. Statue of Ram√≥n de Campoamor y Campoosorio in Navia in Asturias The poet himself declared that a dolora is a \\"dramatic humorada\\", and that a \\"peque√±o poema\\" is a dolora on a larger scale. These definitions are unsatisfactory. The humoristic, philosophic epigram is an ancient poetic form to which Campoamor has given a new name; his invention goes no further. It cannot be denied that in the Doloras Campoamor's special gifts of irony, grace and pathos find their best expression. Taking a commonplace theme, he presents in four, eight or twelve lines a perfect miniature of condensed emotion. By his choice of a vehicle he has avoided the fatal facility and copiousness which have led many Spanish poets to destruction. It pleased him to affect a vein of melancholy, and this affectation has been reproduced by his followers. He died at Madrid on February 12, 1901.

Its core business includes beverages, aviation and investments in various sectors. The company markets beer under the Kingfisher brand, and owns various other brands of alcoholic beverages. It also launched Kingfisher Airlines, an airline in India whose operation has been halted after problems in 2014 that led to its licence being revoked by the DGCA. United Breweries is India's largest producer of beer. The company chairman is Vijay Mallya, who left India on 2 March 2016, allegedly to escape legal action by Indian banks to whom he owes some in loans. United Breweries now has greater than a 40% share of the Indian brewing market with 79 distilleries and bottling units across the world. In 2005, UB financed a takeover of the spirits business of the rival Shaw-Wallace company, giving it a majority share of India's spirits business. The group also owns the Mendocino Brewing Company in the United States. History The UB Group was founded by a Scotsman, Thomas Leishman, in 1915, when he brought together Castle Brewery and Nilgiris Breweries (1857), Bangalore Brewing Co. (1885), British Brewing Corp. (1903) and BBB Brewery Co. Ltd. (1913). The Group took its initial lessons in manufacturing beer from South India based British breweries. At the age of 22, Vittal Mallya was elected as the company's first Indian director in 1947. After a year, he replaced R G N Price as the chairman of the company. United Breweries made its initial impact by manufacturing bulk beer for the British troops before independence, which was transported in huge barrels or \\"Hogsheads\\". Kingfisher, the group's most visible and profitable brand, made a modest entry in the sixties. During the 1950s and 60s, the company expanded greatly by acquiring other breweries. First was the addition of McDowell as one of the Group subsidiaries, a move which helped United Breweries to extend its portfolio to wines and spirits business. Strategically, the Group moved into agro-based industries and medicines when Mallya acquired Kissan Products and formed a long-term relationship with Hoechst AG of Germany to create the Indian pharmaceutical company now known as Aventis Pharma, the Indian subsidiary of the global pharma major Sanofi-Aventis. UB Group has had some relationship with United Spirits Limited, which is now majority-owned (54.8%) by Diageo. =The logo= The Pegasus, which is the symbol of the United Breweries, first found its place as the Group logo in 1941.

Career Hederstedt was born in N√§ssj√∂ parish, Sweden and did his military service at √Ñlvsborg Regiment (I 15) in Bor√•s in 1963. He was educated at the Swedish Infantry Cadet and Officer Candidate School and became f√§nrik at √Ñlvsborg Regiment after graduating from the Royal Military Academy in 1966. Hederstedt underwent the Higher Staff Course at the Swedish Armed Forces Staff College from 1974 to 1976 and held aspirant positions in the central staffs and troop service at √Ñlvsborg Regiment and Northern Sm√•land Regiment (I 12) in Eksj√∂. Hederstedt was serving at the Defense Staff's Operations Department, responsible of operational planning, from 1976 to 1981. He served as chief of staff of the Swedish UN Battalion of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) in Cyprus in 1981. From 1981 to 1982 he was company commander in the Northern Sm√•land Regiment and from 1982 to 1986 he served as the head of the Defense Staff's Quartermaster Department. Hederstedt was battalion commander at Bohusl√§n Regiment (I 17) in Uddevalla from 1986 to 1988 when he was promoted to colonel. Hederstedt was appointed battalion commander of the Swedish UN Battalion of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) in Lebanon in 1988. In Lebanon, Hederstedt conducted many negotiations on various levels with several of the factions (e.g., PLO, PFLP, Hezbollah, Black September, Amal, etc. and Israeli supported Christian guerrilla parties). He was commanding officer of the Life Guards Brigade (MekIB 1) at Svea Life Guards (I 1) in Kungs√§ngen from 1988 to 1993. Between 1989 and 1992 Hederstedt was also the Course Director for UN Nordic Staff officers courses dealing with guerilla warfare. He also conducted fact-finding trips to troublespots, including Cyprus, Kuwait, Iraq, Iran, and the Middle East (Israel, Gaza, and Lebanon). Hederstedt was commanding officer of the Western Army Division in Sk√∂vde from 1993 to 1996. Hederstedt was promoted to major general in 1996 and was appointed International Operations Commander at the Swedish Armed Forces Headquarters. In May 1997, Hederstedt led a Partnership for Peace exercise in Germany with 1,900 officers from 28 countries. In 1997 he also became military adviser to the Minister for Defence Bj√∂rn von Sydow and in 1998 he was promoted to lieutenant general. Hederstedt accompanied Bj√∂rn von Sydow on several trips to Angola, Namibia, South Africa, Kenya, Morocco, Congo, Uganda where they met with government leaders and members of opposition parties. During the 1990s, Hederstedt was also on the ground monitoring the Balkan conflict. He was responsible for the Swedish participation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Macedonia, and Kosovo. There he met with the leaders of many guerrilla movements and studied their organisations and command structures. Hederstedt reported to the Swedish government from the ground about the war in 1998 and 1999. Hederstedt was appointed Supreme Commander of the Swedish Armed Forces on 1 July 2000 and simultaneously promoted to general. During his time as Supreme Commander Hederstedt executed the largest transformation of the Swedish Armed Forces in modern time. This included a change from a defence of invasion to a more flexible response defence, a radical change including a strong internationalization of the whole defence. During 2001 Hederstedt was President in the European Union Military Committee. He was in this capacity the chairman of the chiefs of defence of European Union. During this time the European Union military structure and capacity was formed and developed. During his time as Supreme Commander, he developed and set the basics of a new organisational and technical worked based structure of the Swedish defence. The change of the defence also concluded a complete integration of the military services. A total regional logistic solution was also phased out and was replaced by a solution based on a complete overview which created large rationality and further improvement. Hederstedt left the position of Supreme Commander och retired from the military on 31 December 2003. Post- retirement Hederstedt became partner of Gaia Leadership in 2004. In December 2004 Hederstedt got the mission of the Swedish government to coordinate and organise the aid work in Thailand after the Tsunami disaster. The primarily responsibility was to send home deceased Swedish citizens.

Along with Smolenskaya and Kievskaya, it was built in 1953 to replace an older, parallel section of track which has since become part of the Filyovskaya line. The old station had been damaged in a German bomb attack in 1941, so its replacement was much deeper and included larger stations that could double as shelters (especially in the event of nuclear attack). Although it was initially supposed to be closed permanently, the old section reopened five years later, creating the somewhat confusing situation of having two pairs of completely separate stations with the same names (Arbatskaya and Smolenskaya). Plaque in the passage connecting Arbatsko‚ÄìPokrovskaya and Filyovskaya lines Arbatskaya was designed by Leonid Polyakov, Valentin Pelevin and Yury Zenkevich. Since it was meant to serve as a bomb shelter as well as a Metro station, Arbatskaya is both large (the 250-m platform is the second- longest in Moscow) and deep (41 m underground). The main tunnel is elliptical in cross-section, an unusual departure from the standard circular design. The station features low, square pylons faced with red marble and a high vaulted ceiling elaborately decorated with ornamental brackets, floral reliefs, and chandeliers. Transfers From this station passengers can transfer to Biblioteka Imeni Lenina on the Sokolnicheskaya line, Aleksandrovsky Sad on the Filyovskaya line, and Borovitskaya on the Serpukhovsko‚ÄìTimiryazevskaya line. Despite the name, however, it is not possible to transfer to Arbatskaya on the Filyovskaya line. In popular culture The station and on the Filyovskaya line are featured in the Resident Evil: Retribution Moscow segment. The station, alongside Aleksandrovskiy Sad, Biblioteka Lenina, and Borovitskaya, makes up the 'city-state' of Polis in the Metro 2033 series of games and novels.

The musical is suggested by two short stories by Deborah Eisenberg, Days and Flotsam. It concerns a group of friends living in New York City, one of whom, Charlotte, decides to stop smoking and then swims to compensate for the lack of nicotine. LaChiusa has said that he sees Little Fish as a \\"parable of sorts\\" for New York after the September 11 attacks.Brantley, Ben.New York Times review of \\"Little Fish\\"The New York Times, February 14, 2003 Production history The musical premiered off-Broadway at the Second Stage Theatre in New York City on February 13, 2003, and closed on March 9, 2003. Directed and choreographed by Graciela Daniele, it starred Jennifer Laura Thompson in the lead role of Charlotte and featured Hugh Panaro as Robert, Lea DeLaria as Cinder, and Jesse Tyler Ferguson as Marco. During the run educational workshops were run by Tracy Bersley. Alice Ripley starred, with Gregory Jbara and Chad Kimball, in a production running from October 9, 2007, to November 18, 2007, at The Blank Theatre, Hollywood, California.Stoudt, Charlotte.

New Desk. \\"Finborough Theatre's LITTLE FISH Closes November 21\\" westend.broadwayworld.com, November 21, 2009 Synopsis In the present time, Charlotte, in her early 30s, lives in New York and is a short-story writer. She has given up smoking cigarettes, but without them she sees herself clearly, and believes that it is not an attractive picture. She is frightened by her new-found reality, thus her friends Marco and Kathy suggest various activities, such as collecting dolls or a new drug. However, she opts for what is presumably the least silly; swimming. Charlotte thinks back to 1993, when she lived in Buffalo with her lover Robert, in his 40s, and she studied English Literature with him. She reflects on her childhood heroine, Anne Frank, who warns her about flotsam: emotional \\"debris\\" that blocks the flow of life. As Charlotte sees that she has been addicted not only to cigarettes but \\"fleeing\\", she is able to connect with her friends and her writing.LaChiusa, Michael John. Little Fish (2003), Dramatists Play Service, Inc., =Concept= Don Shewey noted that the musical \\"departs from any kind of traditional book musical structure. Charlotte's tale emerges in vignettes that flicker and flash, zooming back and forth in time, held together by a narrative thread as tenuous as her nonsmoking sanity.\\" Further, the music is \\"eclectic\\" and includes \\"Latin, jazz, rock, there's pure urban noise.\\" Songs *\\"Days\\" - Charlotte, Company *\\"Robert\\" - Charlotte *\\"It's A Sign\\" - Cinder *\\"The Pool (Part 1)\\" - Charlotte, Company *\\"Lockerroom (Part 1)\\" *\\"Winter Is Here/The Pool (Part 2)\\" - Charlotte *\\"Short Story\\" - Robert, Lifeguards *\\"Perfect\\" - Kathy *\\"John Paul/Disco\\" - Charlotte, Kathy *\\"He\\" - Robert, Men *\\"Cigarette Dream\\" - Charlotte, Company *\\"Flotsam\\" - Anne *\\"Lockerroom 2\\" *\\"I Ran\\" - Marco *\\"The Track (Part 1)\\" *\\"Mr. Bunder/By The Way\\" - Mr. Bunder *\\"Remember Me\\" - Kathy *\\"Anne\\" - Young Girl *\\"Little Fish\\" - Marco *\\"Poor Charlotte\\" - Cinder *\\"The Track (Part 2)\\" *\\"Flotsam\\" Reprise *\\"Simple Creature\\" - Charlotte *\\"Gallery/Perfect\\" Reprise *\\"In Two's and Three's\\" - Charlotte, Company Response Both Daniele and LaChiusa said Charlotte's struggle to quit smoking is \\"a metaphor for the crises that force people to reconsider who they are and what is important. Mr. LaChiusa said the musical was his oblique response to Sept. 11: 'After that happened, nobody was thinking about how to get rich and famous. You wanted to be around the people you love.' \\"... LaChiusa went on to add that \\" 'But after you've been here [New York] a while, you realize that you don't always have to swim upstream and battle the elements.

Certainly, Riccardo Hern√°ndez's terraced, silver-toned set, with its evocation of concrete canyons enhanced by Peggy Eisenhauer's shifting lighting, brings to mind Boris Aronson's fabled designs for the original Company. And Mr. LaChiusa's Charlotte, like Mr. Sondheim's Bobby, is a wistful, disengaged soul who is surrounded by people who advise her on how to live....The problem, as the show goes on, is that there's an inevitable monotony to Charlotte's interior life.\\" The talkinbroadway review noted:\\"It hits all its marks well, but never has quite the \\"oomph\\" needed to put it over the top. This may be due to Graciela Daniele's direction and choreography which are fine but unexceptional, never completely communicating in the same urban language that drips from every LaChiusa's score and libretto...LaChiusa can and does impress, time and time again, though perhaps never more effectively than in Charlotte's late-show song, \\"Simple Creature.\\" It's one of the most stirring and artfully constructed musical scenes to hit the New York stage in years.\\"Murray, Matthew.

Early life Conrad was born in Winchester, Virginia. He was the son of Robert Young Conrad, a prominent lawyer of Winchester, and state attorney general from 1857 to 1862; his mother was Elizabeth Whiting, daughter of Burr Powell. After attending the Virginia Military Institute, Conrad proceeded in 1858 to the University of Virginia. At the outbreak of the Civil War he enlisted as a private in Company A, 1st Virginia Cavalry and saw active service throughout the war. He was commissioned a lieutenant and was appointed adjutant in August 1862. In 1864 he became major and assistant inspector general of Thomas Rosser‚Äôs cavalry division, serving there until the end of the war. Career In 1865 Conrad commenced the study of law in his father‚Äôs office in Winchester, and on his admission to the Virginia bar in January 1866, joined his father‚Äôs practice. In 1878, he was elected to the Virginia legislature, serving until 1882. Over the next few years, he became one of the leaders of the Virginia bar and acquired an influential position in the councils of the Democratic Party. In 1890, Conrad was a charter member of The Virginia Bar Association. In 1893 President Grover Cleveland appointed him Assistant Attorney General of the U.S., and in 1895 he became Solicitor General. When he left the position of Solicitor General in 1897, Conrad was retained by President William McKinley on behalf of the Federal government in Morris v. U.S. In October 1901 he joined the law faculty of Georgetown University as lecturer on the history of English law. In 1904 Conrad was again retained on behalf of the Federal government as a special prosecutor in the Postal Fraud Cases. During the last 20 years of his life he was constantly engaged in appeals before the Supreme Court of the United States, where his outstanding ability had wide scope. He achieved his greatest success in the last case he was engaged on, Commonwealth of Virginia v. State of West Virginia, involving the amount of the contributive share that the latter state should pay toward the public debt of the former. Appearing as counsel for Virginia, Conrad‚Äôs argument upon demurrer in the Supreme Court (206 U.S. 290) was in professional circles considered remarkable. Judgment was ultimately given against West Virginia for $12,393,929. For this complicated litigation he was specially retained by the bond-holding creditors. Conrad was of striking appearance, tall of stature with an erect military bearing. Though wielding great political influence in his state, he did not care for public office. By nature somewhat of an aristocrat and reserved in manner, he was never what some might call a \\"good mixer\\". Although that may be, serving as his comrade, Maj. Foxhall Daingerfield's, best man as Daingerfield's Nov., 1864 wedding, when Daingerfield said the part of the Episcopal service, to Nettie Gray, his bride, \\"I do thee with all my worldly good endow,\\" Conrad blurted out, \\"There goes DiVernon!\\", the Major's warhorse. (The Major went back to war, but DiVernon didn't.) As a lawyer he excelled in discussing constitutional questions, and was at his best in appellate work before the Supreme Court. He had an extreme distaste for routine office work. Holmes Conrad was married twice and had seven children. After his death in 1915, he was buried in Mt. Hebron Cemetery in Winchester, Virginia.

Etymology  An inkhorn is an inkwell made of horn. It was an important item for many scholars, which soon became symbolic of writers in general. Later, it became a byword for fussy or pedantic writers. The phrase \\"inkhorn term\\" is found as early as 1553.Thomas Wilson, The Arte of Rhetorique, 1553: \\"Among all other lessons this should first be learned, that wee neuer affect any straunge ynkehorne termes, but to speake as is commonly receiued:\\" (modernized spelling: \\"Among all other lessons this should first be learned, that we never affect any strange inkhorn terms, but to speak as is commonly received:\\"),Original texts from the inkhorn debate  Adoption  Controversy over inkhorn terms was rife from the mid-16th to the mid-17th century, during the transition from Middle English to Modern English, when English competed with Latin as the main language of science and learning in England, having already displaced French.(227) A Biography of the English Language, 2nd. Ed. C.M. Millward Many words, often self-consciously borrowed from classical literature, were deemed useless by critics who argued that the understanding of these redundant borrowings depends on knowledge of classical languages. Some borrowings filled a technical or scientific semantic gap, but others coexisted with Germanic words, often overtaking them. Writers such as Thomas Elyot and George Pettie were enthusiastic borrowers whereas Thomas Wilson and John Cheke opposed borrowing. Cheke wrote: Many of these so-called inkhorn terms, such as dismiss, celebrate, encyclopedia, commit, capacity and ingenious, stayed in the language. Many other neologisms faded soon after they were first used; for example, expede is now obsolete, although the synonym expedite and the similar word impede survive. Faced with the influx of loanwords, some writers, as well known as Charles Dickens tried to either resurrect older English words (gleeman for musician ‚Äì see glee, sicker for certainly, inwit for conscience, yblent for confused) or to coin brand new words from Germanic roots (endsay for conclusion, yeartide for anniversary, foresayer for prophet).  Legacy  Few of these words, coined in opposition to inkhorn terms remained in common usage, and the writers who disdained the use of Latinate words often could not avoid using other loanwords. Although the inkhorn controversy was over by the end of the 17th century, many writers sought to return to what they saw as the purer roots of the language. William Barnes coined words, such as starlore for astronomy and speechcraft for grammar, but they were not widely accepted. George Orwell famously analysed and criticised the socio-political impact of the usage of such words:  See also  * Aureation * Classical compound * Franglais * Plain language * Prestige (sociolinguistics) * Uncleftish Beholding  References   Further reading  * Original texts from the inkhorn debate Category:Word coinage Category:Linguistic purism Category:History of the English language Category:Historical linguistics ","title":"Inkhorn term"},{"id":"2440452","text":"Chappal Waddi is a mountain in Nigeria and, at 2,419 meters, is the country's highest point.http://www.freeworldmaps.net/africa/nigeria/map.html Physical Map of Nigeria It is located in Taraba State, near the border with Cameroon, in the Gashaka Gumti Forest Reserve and Gashaka-Gumti National Park on the Mambilla Plateau.http://www.nigeria-direct.com/activity/climb- nigeria's-highest-mountain-chappal-waddi it is a part of the Bamenda-Adamawa- Mandara Mountain chain of Nigeria and Cameroon.

Portrait by Burnet Reading (1815). John Wall Callcott (20 November 1766 ‚Äì 15 May 1821) was an eminent English composer. Callcott was born in Kensington, London. He was a pupil of Haydn, and is celebrated mainly for his glee compositions and catches. In the best known of his catches he ridiculed Sir John Hawkins' History of Music. Although ill-health prevented Callcott from completing his Musical Dictionary, His Musical Grammar (1806) remained in use throughout the 19th century. His glees number at least 100, of which 8 won prizes. Callcott set lyrics by leading poets of his day, including Thomas Gray, Sir Walter Scott, Thomas Chatterton, Robert Southey and Ossian. They include (selective list): *O snatch me swift for 5 voices SATBarB *It was a friar of orders grey for 3 voices SSB *In the lonely vale of streams for 4 voices SATB *Ella for 4 voices SATB *Cara, vale! for 4 voices SSTB *Father of Heroes (1792) for 5 voices ATTBB *The Erl-King - a setting of Goethe's Erlk√∂nig translated into English by Matthew Lewis, author of the Gothic novel, The Monk, *the original setting (as a three part glee) of Drink to me only with thine eyes A number of his glees specify two soprano or treble (boy soprano) voices, the second of which has a range appropriate to a female mezzo-soprano or contralto (but would have been thought too high for a counter-tenor of this period). Callcott also composed solo songs and religious music including psalms and sacred canons. Callcott's daughter Elizabeth married William Horsley who, in 1824, published A collection of Glees Canons and Catches, an edition of his father-in-law's works together with a Memoir of Dr Callcott. His son William Hutchins Callcott became a composer and arranger. His brother Augustus Wall Callcott was a noted landscape painter.

He also started writing for the Record Mirror, and wrote the first UK press profiles of such musicians as Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf. Biography, Allmusic.com. Retrieved 8 November 2016 Sue and Island Records Stevens was approached by record company executive Chris Blackwell in 1964 to run the Sue record label in the UK, as an offshoot of Island Records. He took responsibility for releasing a string of successful R&B; singles on Sue in the UK, including records by Ike and Tina Turner, Rufus Thomas, Elmore James, Wilbert Harrison, Donnie Elbert, and Inez and Charlie Foxx. He also compiled and annotated The Sue Story compilation LPs. Stevens used the Sue label to put out obscure American singles not only from the U.S. Sue group of labels, but from many small independent record companies, and some of the bigger ones. It became widely influential. Stevens was also president of the Chuck Berry Appreciation Society, and had a say in the UK releases that Pye International put out by Berry, Bo Diddley and others on the Chess and Checker labels. It was Guy Stevens who brought Berry to the UK for his first tour after paying his bail to get him out of jail for offences under the Mann Act. He broke into record production at Blackwell's suggestion in 1965, firstly on a single by Alex Harvey and then producing live albums by Larry Williams and Lee Dorsey. The following year, he was appointed head of A&R; at Island Records. His first signing to the label was Birmingham band The V.I.P.s, who soon changed their name to Art. Stevens produced their early recordings, before they added keyboardist Gary Wright to become Spooky Tooth. Stevens also managed and produced Hapshash and the Coloured Coat, an artistic and musical collaboration between the band Art and designers Michael English and Nigel Waymouth, which led to the album Featuring the Human Host and the Heavy Metal Kids. Stevens also introduced lyricist Keith Reid to keyboardist Gary Brooker of The Paramounts. He encouraged them to write together, and reportedly commented to Reid at a party that a friend had turned \\"a whiter shade of pale\\". The resulting song was recorded by Brooker's newly formed band, named Procol Harum by Stevens, and - though turned down by Blackwell at Island - went on to become one of the defining songs of the era. In 1968, Stevens was imprisoned for several months for drug offences, during which time his record collection was stolen, leading to a breakdown. However, on his release he returned to Island Records, and produced albums by Free, Mighty Baby, and Heavy Jelly. =Mott the Hoople= While working for Island, Stevens was fundamental in the formation of Mott the Hoople. The band was originally called \\"Silence,\\" with the line-up of Stan Tippins on vocals, Mick Ralphs on lead guitar, Verden Allen on keyboards, Overend Watts on bass, and Dale Griffin on drums. Envisioning a band with a sound that would be a combination of The Rolling Stones and Bob Dylan, Stevens recruited and mentored Ian Hunter as lead singer, and demoted Stan Tippins to road manager. Stevens also named the band after the Willard Manus novel, which he had read while in prison. Stevens served as the Mott's manager, and produced their eponymous 1969 debut album and its 1970 follow-up, Mad Shadows (1970). After Mad Shadows met with poor sales and negative reviews, Mott dispensed with Stevens' services and produced their third album, Wildlife (1971), by themselves. After that album's commercial failure, Mott re-recruited Stevens to produce the Brain Capers album (1971). On the verge of splitting up in 1972, Mott again dropped Stevens, and signed to Tony DeFries' company MainMan. Mott's fifth album, All the Young Dudes, was produced by David Bowie. Later activities By the mid-1970s, Stevens' activities had become increasingly erratic as a result of his chronic alcoholism. =The Clash= In 1976 Stevens was present, although not clearly as a producer, on a demo session which The Clash undertook before they were signed. Mick Jones recalled that: In 1979, the band recruited Stevens to produce their album London Calling. The band themselves have always held up Stevens' input as a major factor in the album's popularity and quality. The Clash involved Stevens because they recognized the influential role he had played in the British beat and blues booms of the 1960s. The Who, The Small Faces, The Rolling Stones and many others used Stevens' knowledge of the American R&B; and soul scene as a source for their own repertoire, having heard of him through his deejaying at the New Scene Club. Stevens' involvement with the production of London Calling is explored extensively in Marcus Grey's book Route 19 Revisited: The Clash and the Making of London Calling (2012). Death and legacy Stevens died on 28 August 1981, at the age of 38, having overdosed on the prescription drugs he was taking to reduce his alcohol dependency. In 1981, The Clash wrote a song for, or about Stevens, who had died the same year: \\"Midnight to Stevens\\". It is a lush sweeping song that sounds unlike almost anything the Clash recorded despite the range of styles on Sandinista! and Combat Rock. It was released originally as the b-side of a 12\\" Clash single in the summer of 1982. It was later released in 1991, when it appeared on disc three of Clash on Broadway. Stevens' involvement in Mott the Hoople's early career was covered in the 2011 documentary, The Ballad of Mott the Hoople. Stevens also produced Free's debut album Tons of Sobs, the eponymous debut album of Mighty Baby, and the debut of Spooky Tooth, Supernatural Fairy Tales. A poem in tribute to Stevens was included by Ian Hunter on the lyric sheet of his 1983 CBS album All Of The Good Ones Are Taken, which concluded: \\"I remember the guy with the electric hair at that first rehearsal standing there. You gave your heart - you gave your soul. God bless you, Guy - Rock n Roll!\\" In assessing himself, Stevens stated, \\"There are only two Phil Spectors in the world... and I'm one of them!\\" References External links *Procol Harum.com biography of Guy Stevens * Category:1943 births Category:1981 deaths Category:English record producers Category:People from East Dulwich Category:20th-century British musicians Category:English DJs Category:English music journalists Category:English people convicted of drug offences Category:Drug-related deaths in England ","title":"Guy Stevens"},{"id":"2440525","title":"Mikaela Ingberg"},{"id":"2440534","title":"Columbus Metropolitan Airport"},{"id":"2440535","text":"King Pharmaceuticals, is a wholly owned subsidiary of Pfizer based in Bristol, Tennessee.

In January 1994, King acquired a former King College campus plant in Bristol, Tennessee. The facility was purchased for $1.18 million from RSR Pharmaceutical, who had been using it after Beecham merged with SmithKline. King initially manufactured drugs for other pharmaceutical companies, but soon established a strategy of acquiring branded prescription drugs, which have a much higher gross margin than contract manufactured drugs. In February 1998, King acquired 15 branded pharmaceuticals, a sterile products manufacturing facility located in Rochester, Michigan that it called the \\"Parkedale Facility\\") and some contract manufacturing contracts. By December 1998 King had placed its sterile products business into a subsidiary it named Parkedale Pharmaceuticals. King Pharmaceuticals obtained about twenty smaller branded drugs from the start up of the company until it went public in June 1998. The King Pharmaceuticals subsidiary Monarch Pharmaceuticals acquired one of its most profitable branded drugs, Altace, later the same year on December 18, 1998 from Hoechst Marion Roussel.

The bulk of Gregory's personal fortune was due in large part due to the ability of King Pharmaceuticals, Inc. to reintroduce the Hoechst branded prescription drug Altace back into the U.S. market under the King Pharmaceuticals, Inc. subsidiary Monarch Pharmaceuticals brand following the 1998 U.S. marketing and distribution agreement between King Pharmaceuticals/Monarch Pharmaceuticals and AG Hoechst/HMR. In late December 1998, King Pharmaceuticals (d.b.a.

As a result of increasing the number of sales representatives and the findings of the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE), Altace sales increased. Using profits from Altace, King continued to add product lines, the most significant purchases being Levoxyl, Thrombin, and Cytomel in 2000. Also in 2000, seeing fewer opportunities to obtain branded drugs, the company acquired an R&D; company based in North Carolina. In 2002, King and Meridian Medical Technologies Inc. agreed that King would purchase Merdian for $247.8 million in cash; Meridian was a manufacturer of autoinjectors, including EpiPen, an epinephrine autoinjector.King Pharmaceuticals Oct 21, 2002.

In 2002, John Gregory stepped down as CEO, and his brother Jefferson Gregory took over. Then in 2004, Jeff Gregory stepped down as well after the SEC began investigations into King's Medicaid billing practices. The board named Brian Markison to replace him. Soon after, in July 2004, a deal was made for Mylan Laboratories to acquire King for $4 billion. Investors, most notably Carl Icahn, were critical of the merger, saying that Mylan was overpaying for King. The next year the deal was called off. In 2008 King Pharmaceuticals acquired Alpharma Pharmaceuticals to expand into the pain treatment market.

The competition pits swimming stars from two nations to see which is the best across a series of events. The concept was revealed by USA Swimming in 2003 as a way to develop the rivalry between the world's two largest swimming powerhouse nations: Australia and the United States. Following three consecutive American victories, the format was discontinued in favor of a matchup between Americans and an all-star team from various European nations. The event has been compared to golf's Ryder Cup. 2003-2007: United States vs. Australia =2003= At the inaugural event Mutual of Omaha/Fujitsu Duel in the Pool in Indianapolis, Indiana on April 6, 2003, the Americans overwhelmed the Australians, 196-74, winning 21 of the 26 events. This result set the stage for Team USA's dominant performance at both the 2003 World Championships and later the 2004 Olympics in Athens. =2005= On August 2, 2005, the United States captured victories in 18 of the 28 events in front of the sold-out crowd of 2,600 in Irvine, California.

The United States won their third straight Duel in the Pool, with a score of 181.5 points to Australia's 129.5. Libby Lenton became the first woman to beat the 53 second mark in the 100 metre freestyle, beating the previous world record by 0.31 seconds with a time of 52.99. At the time, she was racing against American Michael Phelps, who clocked in at 48.72 seconds. However, due to the nature of the relay in question not being recognised as an official by the world governing body (FINA), her time was not ratified as a world record. 2009-Present: United States vs. Europe =2009= The event took place December 19‚Äì20, 2009 between the USA and a combined British, German and Italian team swimming under the team name E-Stars in Manchester, England.

He was created the second Duke of Coimbra in 1509. He was also master of the Order of Santiago and administrator of the Order of Aviz from 1492 to 1550. Early life Jorge de Lancastre was born in Abrantes on August 21, 1481, and raised by his aunt, the king's sister, Joan of Portugal, in the Convent of Jesus in Aveiro. On Joan's death in 1490, Jorge was brought to the royal court, and was soon placed under the tutorship of monteiro-mor Diogo Fernandes de Almeida (the son of John II's late ally, Lopo de Almeida, Count of Abrantes). Succession Campaign After the death of the royal heir Prince Afonso in July 1491, King John II was left with no legitimate sons and no daughters he could marry off. The next legitimate successor to the throne was his cousin (and brother-in-law), Manuel, 4th Duke of Beja and grand master of the Order of Christ since 1484. This was a disturbing prospect for John II, who trusted neither Manuel nor the powerful Order of Christ. During the purges of the high nobility in 1483‚Äì84, John II had ordered the execution of Manuel's own brother Diogo, Duke of Viseu and brother-in-law Fernando II, Duke of Braganza. Manuel himself only escaped a similar fate largely because John II regarded him as a harmless fool. Now that 'fool' stood to succeed him, and in John II's estimation, would likely undo all the king's hard-won centralizing reforms and deliver the kingdom back to the nobles. John II consequently launched a campaign to make his natural son, Jorge de Lancastre, his heir. From Pope Innocent VIII, John II received authorization to appoint Jorge as Grand-Master of the Order of Santiago and administrator of the Order of Aviz, in April, 1492. Only a few days later, Jorge's tutor, Diogo Fernandes de Almeida was appointed Prior of Crato (head of the Portuguese branch of the knights of St. John Hospitaller). Meanwhile, Queen Eleanor set about knitting a rival campaign, in conjunction with the Order of Christ, to prevent Jorge's advancement and protect the position of Manuel (her brother) as heir. In 1494, John II dispatched an embassy to Rome, headed by two members of the Almeida clan, to petition Pope Alexander VI to legitimize Jorge de Lancastre. The petition was rejected, bringing the campaign to a disappointing end. John II, however, had no intention of just handing the kingdom over to Manuel's minions. In the will laid out just before his death in 1495, John II requested that Manuel appoint Jorge de Lancastre as Duke of Coimbra and Lord of Montemor-o-Velho and urged Manuel, on his accession, to pass all his other titles and possessions, including the mastership of the Order of Christ and the island of Madeira, over to Jorge. The concentration of power would have made Jorge de Lancastre the most powerful man in the kingdom, reminiscent of his powerful great-grand-uncle Peter of Coimbra (a comparison suggested by John II himself). Mindful of avoiding a civil war, Manuel agreed to many of the items in John II's will, but rejected others ‚Äî notably, Manuel insisted on retaining the Order of Christ for himself. Manuel was not in a hurry to fulfill the rest of the terms. The title of Duke of Coimbra was conferred on Jorge de Lancastre only in May 1500, and confirmation was delayed until May, 1509, nearly fifteen years after his father's death. John II had also requested that young Jorge de Lancastre would be married to a royal princess, having Manuel promise his own first daughter, when they came of age. Manuel only partly fulfilled this in 1500 by betrothing Jorge to Beatriz de Vilhena, the daughter of √Ålvaro of Braganza, not an infanta but nonetheless a princess of royal blood. During Manuel's Reign Arms of D. Jorge de Lancastre, 2nd Duke of Coimbra, from Jean du Cro's Livro do Armeiro-Mor, 1509. Most of the details of Jorge's subsequent life and career are marred by hagiographers of Manuel, eager to portray the king's rival in the worst possible light. But far from the lazy and dissolute picture painted by the royal scribes, the chroniclers of the Order of Santiago seem to have regarded Jorge de Lancastre as a particularly diligent leader and administrator. The Duke continued as an important figure in Portuguese politics, particularly in the first decade or so of Manuel's reign. The Order of Santiago was Jorge's principal power base. Jorge established something akin to an 'opposition' court at the Order's headquarters in Palmela. He gathered around him the principal loyalists of John II, who now became political opponents of King Manuel I of Portugal, notably the Almeida clan, the Ata√≠de family, and, of course, his mother's own family ‚Äî notably, his uncle, Ant√≥nio de Mendon√ßa Furtado, a commendador of the Order of Aviz. Other opposition characters gathered around Jorge included √Ålvaro de Castro and Diogo Lopo da Silveira (Baron of Alvito), and notable India navigators Vasco da Gama and Francisco de Almeida. Jorge is also said to have had the support of many \\"New Christians\\", to have personally given them his protection and to have fought against the introduction of the Holy Inquisition into Portugal. Jorge's party played a rather important role in the early India expeditions. They formed the 'pragmatic' party, insisting, like John II had, that the India expeditions were a commercial venture, a means for the enrichment of the treasury, a 'Renaissance' focus on wealth and power. Manuel's party had a more 'messianic' outlook, seeing the overseas expeditions through the Medieval goggles of Holy War and religious mission, coming up with schemes for two-pronged invasions of Egypt, marches on Mecca and the reconquest of Jerusalem. In this respect, Jorge (if not himself personally, certainly the party he led) played a vital role in keeping the India expeditions on a sane and viable track. Early India armada captains were drawn more from his party, than from Manuel's. In the early years, Jorge's power was partly reliant on the hope that he might yet succeed Manuel, but that prospect diminished quickly as Manuel's new queen, Mary of Spain, produced a succession of sons. As time went on, his early fierce partisans began to slowly distance themselves and look for compromise and advancement with Manuel. For some, that meant leaving Jorge's Orders of Santiago and Aviz and passing over to Manuel's Order of Christ. Among those who made the switch were Francisco de Almeida and Vasco da Gama. Jorge picked a particularly unfortunate fight with Vasco da Gama, once a loyal partisan. After da Gama's glorious return from India in 1499, Manuel deftly promised the town of Sines as a reward to the admiral. But Sines was the property of the Order of Santiago. Instinctively, Jorge was disposed to allow it, as a reward to one of his own; but since it was on the king's order, he feared it was the thin end of the wedge to more royal appropriations of Order properties. So he decided to make a stand on principle and stepped in personally to prevent it. He went so far as to secure the banishment of da Gama from Sines in 1507. This prompted da Gama to make his final break with Jorge, leave his beloved Order of Santiago and switch to the rival Order of Christ. Jorge de Lancastre dedicated himself to defending his two knightly orders, Santiago and Aviz, from the unremitting poaching by Manuel's Order of Christ. In May 1505, Jorge managed to secure a royal order prohibiting knights from leaving his orders without his express permission. But Manuel soon obtained from Pope Alexander VI two bulls to undermine him ‚Äî one from July 1505, giving the King of Portugal the right to dispose of the property of all three Orders; another in January, 1506, authorizing knights to move freely from other Orders to the Order of Christ. However, Jorge continued to resist, and made a point of punishing knights who left without permission (for example, seizing the Sesimbra commenda of Jo√£o de Menezes, Count of Tarouca, for having taken up the position of Prior of Crato without his consent). In 1509, Jorge introduced a new set of rules for the Order of Santiago, overhauling its administration in a centralized fashion, bringing it closer in line with the rules of their Spanish brethren. But with so many defections, Jorge found it hard to maintain his political footing, and his star was quickly waning. In 1516, the humiliation was complete when Manuel secured from Pope Leo X the authority to appoint Jorge's successors as grand masters of the orders of Santiago and Aviz. Later Years King Manuel died in late 1521, and was succeeded by his son, John III of Portugal. But the conflict with Jorge de Lancastre continued, the opposition standard taken up with more energy by Jorge's son, Jo√£o de Lancastre, Marquis of Torres Novas. The sons of the old rivals butted heads politically and, increasingly, in the scandal sheets. In the late 1520s, Jo√£o led the opposition to the marriage of King John III's brother, Infante Ferdinand, to Dona Guiomar Coutinho, a prominent noble heiress to the great feudal estates of Marialva and Loul√©, on the grounds that he had already secretly married her. The King responded by locking up Jo√£o de Lancastre in the Castle of S√£o Jorge for some years (an episode later dramatized by Camilo Castelo Branco in his play O Marquez de Torres-Novas). Jorge himself produced a notable scandal late in life when, at the age of 67, he pursued (and married) a 16-year-old girl, Filipa de Melo (daughter of Dom Fernando de Lima). King John III gave great publicity to the scandal, while, behind Jorge's back, securing an annulment from the pope. When Jorge de Lancastre finally died in late July 1550, John III moved quickly to seize control of the military orders. From Pope Julius III, he received a bull in August 1550 appointing him personally as the master of both the Order of Santiago and the Order of Aviz. This was followed up by a second bull, issued under great diplomatic pressure in December 1551, appointing the Kings of Portugal as masters in perpetuity of both military orders, thus bringing an end to the independence of the orders Jorge had fought so hard to retain. At Jorge's death, John III took back the title of 'Duke of Coimbra' for the Crown. The official explanation was that Coimbra was a royal town and the existence of a feudal title bearing the town's name was inappropriate. The real reason was probably that the king was eager to erase a title that had been borne by two notable challengers of royal power, a name that might still have a magical pull on the imagination of the next bearer. The lands associated with the Duke of Coimbra were passed to the Duke of Aveiro, a new title created by John III shortly before (c. 1535) for Jorge's son and heir, Jo√£o de Lancastre. The line of Lancastre would continue through the Dukes of Aveiro. Marriage In 1500, Jorge married Beatriz de Vilhena, daughter of √Ålvaro of Braganza, brother of the Ferdinand II, Duke of Braganza. Jorge had several children of his marriage with Beatriz de Vilhena: * Jo√£o de Lancastre, 1st Duke of Aveiro * Afonso de Lancastre, Comendador-mor of S√£o Tiago. He had a son: ** √Ålvaro of Lancastre, 3rd Duke of Aveiro * Lu√≠s de Lancastre, Comendador-mor of Aviz, married Magdalena de Granada, granddaughter of Abu l-Hasan Ali, Sultan of Granada and Isabel de Sol√≠s * Jaime de Lancastre, Prior of S√£o Pedro de Torres Vedras, 1st General-inquisitor of the kingdom * Helena de Lancastre, Comendadeira of the Royal Monastery of Santos * Maria de Lancastre, religious in the Monastery of Saint John in Set√∫bal (Soror Maria Madalena) * Filipa de Lancastre, Prior of the Monastery of Saint John in Set√∫bal * Isabel de Lancastre, religious in the Monastery of Saint John in Set√∫bal and after that in the Royal Monastery of Santos. He also had several children outside the marriage. Jorge died in the castle of Palmela on July 22, 1550.

The founder of NextScribe pioneered CSSD at the Monastery of Christ in the Desert in 1994, and NextScribe continues to conduct research in the field in partnership with both Catholic and Protestant organizations. Computer Supported Spiritual Development Computer Supported Spiritual Development (CSSD) is a multidisciplinary study that can span research in multiuser gaming environments, sociology, psychology, spiritual life, artificial intelligence and other topics, but current research is most closely related to computer- supported collaboration as it applies to spiritual life and spiritual community. CSSD includes spiritual formation, but it is not limited to formation. Digital networks will increasingly enable communication in richly human forms, including complex, high bandwidth forms of presence information, and these networks will enable not only wise practices of spiritual formation but also the direct activity of the Holy Spirit among persons. History NextScribe has its roots at the Monastery of Christ in the Desert in New Mexico, which established a web design studio in 1995 and produced one of the first web sites on the topic of spirituality. The site was beautifully illustrated with fine art produced in watercolor by one of the monks. As a result of extensive international publicity over the period 1995‚Äì1997, the web site was one of the most heavily visited on the Internet. In terms of the percentage of worldwide Internet traffic garnered during those years, christdesert.org remains the most successful religious web site in history. In 1996 the founder and director of the monastery's web project was called to Vatican City, where he served as a consultant to the Holy See. While there he clarified his mission to pursue the development of advanced technologies of CSSD that would enable the Church to reform its structure according to classical spiritual practices in the tradition of St. Benedict. NextScribe was founded in Vatican City in 1997 to pursue this objective. Research Since its founding in 1997, NextScribe has conducted seminal research in CSSD in association with both Catholic and Protestant organizations. Some of NextScribe's most important research was conducted in 2002‚Äì2003 in partnership with the multi-denominational Youth Ministry and Spirituality Project (YMSP), funded by the Lily Endowment. Prayerbuddy NextScribe's current research includes Prayerbuddy, an implementation of CSSD applied to the formation of self-organizing lay spiritual community. The technology used is primarily related to the field of computer-supported collaboration and includes an emphasis on wireless presence information. The spiritual practices supported are adapted from the Christian monastic tradition. The Divine Office is being developed in cooperation with the Monastery of Christ in the Desert. Theology of work Within the Benedictine tradition of ora et labora (prayer and work), NextScribe's mission was established upon a \\"Theology of Work\\" that was composed for the project in 1997.A Theology of Work Accordingly, NextScribe conceives creative technological development as a process of union with God as Creator. As an integral companion to Prayerbuddy, NextScribe established the Industrial Theology project in order to explore the theological basis for work and creativity, the right disposition of organizations that support work, and spiritual practices that might complete the union of a worker with God as Creator.

Evergreen International, Inc. was a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization located in Salt Lake City, Utah, whose stated mission was to assist \\"people who want to diminish same-sex attractions and overcome homosexual behavior\\". It adhered to Christian and particularly LDS teaching and supported the doctrines of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). The organization stated this task could be accomplished with the help of the Lord and, in some cases, psychological counseling. Evergreen was founded in 1989 as a grassroots organization by men who were seeking to deal with their homosexual feelings in ways congruent to the teachings of the LDS Church.  Teachings  Evergreen stated that by using the atonement individuals could change, overcome, and transition away from the condition of homosexuality and homosexual sins, and they could diminish their attractions to those of the same sex. The organization also agreed with all teachings and policies of the LDS Church \\"without reservation or exception\\", but stated that it was not \\"affiliated with the Church\\". Evergreen also taught that \\"to be successful in diminishing erotic same-sex attractions and overcoming homosexual behavior, you must be willing to make a total commitment to the change process. It is our testimony that when you do all that you can and are willing to employ all the resources that are available to you, God's grace will make up the difference.\\" They published a map that outlined the major areas that people may have to address to diminish their same-sex attraction and successfully overcome homosexual behavior. It included the following elements: *Read books on same-sex attraction, masculinity/femininity, addictions, and related subjects from LDS authors, Christian authors, and professionals. *Personal prayer. *Develop personal relationship with God and Jesus Christ. *Develop one-on-one, nurturing relationships with family, close friends, and acquaintances. *Provide service to others, both inside and outside Evergreen. *Experience activities as a bridge to the real world (for example, ski trips with men/women who don't experience SSA).\\"  General Authority Addresses  General LDS church leaders spoke at nearly every Evergreen annual conference from 1996 to 2011.

Morrison of the First Quorum of the Seventy addressed members of Evergreen at their 10th annual conference which was held in the church's Joseph Smith Memorial Building and stated, \\"Avoid as the plague social interaction with persons who justify, encourage or engage in homosexual behavior. Stay away from places where those challenged by same-gender attraction congregate.\\" * 2005 ‚Äì At the 15th annual conference Elder James O. Mason of the Second Quorum of the Seventy directed, \\"Can individuals struggling with some same-gender attraction be cured? ‚ÄúWith God nothing should be impossible‚Äù (Luke 1:37) ... The right course of action remains the same: eliminate or diminish same sex attraction.\\" \\"Feelings of attraction toward someone of the same gender should be eliminated if possible or controlled.\\" * 2007 ‚Äì Church seventy Douglas Callister spoke at an Evergreen conference and urged listeners to battle their challenge of \\"same-gender inclinations\\" and thoughts through prayer, fasting, and taking the sacrament. * 2009 ‚Äì Elder Bruce C. Hafen of the First Quorum of the Seventy gave an address at the 19th annual conference promising, \\"If you are faithful, on resurrection morning‚Äîand maybe even before then‚Äîyou will rise with normal attractions for the opposite sex. Some of you may wonder if that doctrine is too good to be true. But Elder Dallin H. Oaks has said it MUST be true, because 'there is no fullness of joy in the next life without a family unit, including a husband and wife, and posterity.' And 'men (and women) are that they might have joy.'\\" * 2010 ‚Äì Keith B. McMullin of the Presiding Bishopric addressed the 20th annual conference and counseled that \\"If someone seeking your help says to you, 'I am homosexual' or 'I am lesbian' or 'I am gay,' correct this miscasting. Heavenly Father does not speak of His children this way, and neither should we. It is simply not true. To speak this way sows seeds of doubt and deceit about who we really are. It belittles, depreciates and disparages the individual.\\" He further teaches that the \\"such limitations\\" as same-gender attraction won't exist after death, though \\"in and of itself it is neither evil nor sinful\\".  Therapy  \\"Evergreen does not advocate any particular form of therapy\\" but did provide suggestions on how to choose a therapist and information on individual and group therapy. Evergreen stated that some people had lessened their same sex attractions by using the following therapies: gender wholeness, reparative, reorientation, and re- education. The website referenced the works of Joseph Nicolosi who says reparative therapy can help people \\"explore the source of their problem, develop nonerotic same-sex relationships that diminish the sexual attraction they feel toward men, become more secure in their gender-identity, and enjoy heterosexual relationships.\\" The therapy is based on the view that homosexual attractions develop because of incomplete gender-identity development and defensive detachment from other males. While some of these therapies offered to reduce same-sex attractions, Evergreen made clear that \\"therapy will likely not be a cure in the sense of erasing all homosexual feelings,\\" but would \\"strengthen masculine identification\\" for men. The LDS Church has stated that it does not have a position on \\"scientific questions\\" such as the cause of homosexuality. Evergreen followed this stance.  Association with NARTH  The National Association for Research & Therapy of Homosexuality (NARTH), also known as the NARTH Institute, is an organization that (since 2014) functions under the Alliance for Therapeutic Choice and Scientific Integrity (ATCSI). It offers conversion therapy and other regimens that purport to change the sexual orientation of people with same-sex attraction. NARTH was founded in 1992 and has been described as \\"a multi-disciplinary professional and scientific organization dedicated to the service of persons who experience unwanted homosexual (same-sex) attractions (SSA)\\". The Evergreen website referenced the therapeutic methods of NARTH founder Joseph Nicolosi as \\"beneficial\\". Nicolosi worked with A. Dean Byrd (an Evergreen Board member, Director of Clinical Training for LDS Social Services, and Brigham Young University professor) to author several papers on reparative therapy. Byrd also served as president of NARTH and also published an article in the LDS church's September 1999 Ensign. Additionally, David C. Pruden served as director of Evergreen and as an officer for NARTH. Likewise, Director of Family Services Jerry Harris served in NARTH leadership.  Effectiveness  Participants in Evergreen programs claimed success in diminishing same-sex attractions and overcoming homosexual behavior. As many as 40% of Evergreen members were in heterosexual marriages. Warren Throckmorton reviewed Understanding the meaning of change for married Latter-Day Saint men with histories of homosexual activity by J. W. Robinson. Robinson interviewed seven heterosexually married men who had been through Evergreen and previously identified as gay. They believed that they had a spiritual transformation which changed their orientation. They also stated that they were no longer troubled by feeling different or rejected by heterosexual men, emotional attraction to men, sexual attraction to men, feeling bad about same-sex desires, social isolation, or compulsive sexual thoughts and behaviors. Robinson found that their change came from a new understanding that prior same-sex attractions did not require them to be gay.  Relations with the LDS Church  Although it functioned independently of any church, Evergreen was religiously based on the teachings of the LDS Church. The organization adhered to its teachings \\"without reservation or exception.\\" Evergreen had LDS general authorities on its board of trustees and taught LDS Church principles to Latter-day Saints and ecclesiastical leaders by coordinating with the Church as well as by hosting various events, such as firesides (informal evening gatherings of church members), workshops, and conferences. General LDS church leaders spoke at nearly every Evergreen annual conference from 1996 to 2011.

It is not a religious institute, but an organization of secular priests and lay persons dedicated to missionary work in foreign lands.Asia in the Making of Europe, p.231 The Society of Foreign Missions of Paris was established 1658‚Äì63. In 1659, instructions for establishment of the Paris Foreign Missions Society were given by Rome's Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith. This marked the creation of a missionary institution that, for the first time, did not depend on the control of the traditional missionary and colonial powers of Spain or Portugal.Missions, p.3 In the 350 years since its foundation, the institution has sent more than 4,200 missionary priests to Asia and North America. Their mission is to adapt to local customs and languages, develop a native clergy, and keep close contacts with Rome.Missions, p.4 In the 19th century, local persecutions of missionary priests of the Paris Foreign Missions Society was often a pretext for French military intervention in Asia.Missions, p.5 In Vietnam, such persecutions were used by the French government to justify the armed interventions of Jean-Baptiste C√©cille and Rigault de Genouilly. In China, the murder of Father Auguste Chapdelaine became the casus belli for the French involvement in the Second Opium War in 1856. In Korea, persecutions were used to justify the 1866 French campaign against Korea. Today, the Paris Foreign Missions Society remains an active institution in the evangelization of Asia. Background Building of the Missions √©trang√®res de Paris, 128 Rue du Bac, Paris. Symbol of the Missions √âtrang√®res de Paris. The traditional colonial powers of Spain and Portugal had initially received from the Pope an exclusive agreement to evangelize conquered lands, a system known as Padroado Real in Portuguese and Patronato real in Spanish. After some time however, Rome grew dissatisfied with the Padroado system, due to its limited means, strong involvement with politics, and dependence on the kings of Spain and Portugal for any decision.Mantienne, p.22 From a territorial standpoint also, Portugal had been losing ground against the new colonial powers of England and the Dutch Republic, meaning that it was becoming less capable of evangelizing new territories.Les Missions √©trang√®res, p.30 In territories that it used to control, Portugal had seen some disasters; for instance, Japanese Christianity was eradicated from around 1620.Les Missions Etrang√®res, p.25 Finally, Roman officials had doubts about the efficacy of religious orders, such as the Dominicans, Franciscans, Jesuits or Barnabites, since they were highly vulnerable in case of persecutions. They did not seem able to develop local clergy, who would be less vulnerable to state persecution. Sending bishops to develop a strong local clergy seemed to be the solution to achieve future expansion: As early as 1622 Pope Gregory XV, wishing to take back control of the missionary efforts, had established the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith (Congregatio de Propaganda Fide, commonly known as Propaganda) with the objective of bringing to the Catholic faith non-Catholic Christians (Protestants, Oriental Christians), but also inhabitants of the American continent and Asia. In order to do so, Rome resurrected the system of Apostolic vicars, who would report directly to Rome in their missionary efforts, and would be responsible to create a native clergy.Mantienne, p.23 In the field, violent conflicts would erupt between the Padroado and the Propaganda during the 17th and 18th centuries. (When the first missionaries of the Paris Foreign Missions Society were sent to the Far East, the Portuguese missionaries were ordered to capture them and send them to Lisbon).Asia in the Making of Europe, p.232 The creation of the Paris Foreign Missions Society was well-aligned with Rome's efforts to develop the role of the Propaganda.Mantienne, p.26  Establishment  The French Jesuit Alexandre de Rhodes is at the origin of the creation of the Paris Foreign Missions Society. The creation of the Paris Foreign Missions Society was initiated when the Jesuit Father Alexandre de Rhodes, back from Vietnam and asking for the dispatch of numerous missionaries to the Far East, obtained in 1650 an agreement by Pope Innocent X to send secular priests and bishops as missionaries.Missions, p.3-4 Alexandre de Rhodes received in Paris in 1653 a strong financial and organizational support from the Compagnie du Saint- Sacrement for the establishment of the Paris Foreign Missions Society.Mantienne, p.26-28Asia in the Making of Europe, p.232 Alexander de Rhodes found secular clergy volunteers in Paris in the persons of Fran√ßois Pallu and Pierre Lambert de la Motte and later Ignace Cotolendi, the first members of the Paris Foreign Missions Society, who were sent to the Far-East as Apostolic vicariate.Viet Nam By Nhung Tuyet Tran, Anthony Reid p.222An Empire Divided by James Patrick Daughton, p.31Asia in the Making of Europe, p.229-230 Due to the strong opposition of Portugal and the death of Pope Innocent X the project was stalled for several years however, until the candidates to the missions decided to go by themselves to Rome in June 1657. =Appointment of missionary Bishops= Mgr Fran√ßois Pallu, founding father of the Paris Foreign Missions Society. Mgr Pierre Lambert de la Motte (1624‚Äì1679). On 29 July 1658, the two chief founders of the Paris Foreign Missions Society were appointed as bishops in the Vatican, becoming Mgr Pallu, Bishop of Heliopolis in Augustamnica, Vicar Apostolic of Tonkin, and Mgr Lambert de la Motte, Bishop of Berytus, Vicar Apostolic of Cochinchina.Les Missions Etrangeres, p.35 On 9 September 1659, the Papal Bull Super cathedram principis apostolorum by Pope Alexander VII defined the territories they would have to administer: for Mgr Pallu, Tonkin, Laos, and five adjacent provinces of southern China (Yunnan, Guizhou, Huguang, Sichuan, Guangxi), for Mgr Lambert de la Motte, Cochinchina and five provinces of southeastern China (Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong, Jiangxi, Hainan). In 1660 the third founder was appointed as Mgr Cotolendi, Bishop of Metellopolis, Vicar Apostolic of Nanjing, with also five provinces of China, namely Beijing, Shanxi, Shandong, Korea and Tartary. All of them were nominated Bishops in partibus infidelium (\\"In areas of the Infidels\\", i.e. Heliopolis, Beirut, Metellopolis etc...), receiving long-disappeared bishopric titles from areas that had been lost, in order not to compromise contemporary bishopric titles and avoid conflicts with the bishoprics established through the padroado system. In 1658 also, Fran√ßois de Laval was nominated Vicar Apostolic of Canada,Institutional Culture in Early Modern Society By Anne Goldgar, Robert I. p.25 Note 77 and Bishop of Petra in partibus infidelium, becoming the first Bishop of New France, and in 1663 he would found the S√©minaire de Qu√©bec with the support of the Paris Foreign Missions Society.A Bibliography of Canadian Imprints, 1751‚Äì1800 by Marie Tremaine p.70 The Society itself (\\"Assembl√©e des Missions\\") was formally established by the Compagnie du Saint-Sacrement in 1658.Mantienne, p.29 The object of the new society was and is still the evangelization of non- Christian countries, by founding churches and raising up a native clergy under the jurisdiction of the bishops. The Society was officially recognized in 1664.Tran, Anh Q. (2017). Gods, Heroes, and Ancestors: An Interreligious Encounter in Eighteenth-Century Vietnam. Oxford University Press. . Page 27. The creation of the Paris Foreign Missions Society coincided with the establishment of the French East India Company. Mgr Ignace Cotolendi (1630‚Äì1662). In order to dispatch the three missionaries to Asia, the Compagnie du Saint-Sacrement established a trading company (the \\"Compagnie de Chine\\", founded 1660). A ship, the Saint-Louis, was built in the Netherlands by the shipowner Fermanel, but the ship foundered soon after being launched.Mantienne, p.28 At the same time, the establishment of a trading company and the perceived threat of French missionary efforts to Asia was met with huge opposition by the Jesuits, the Portuguese, the Dutch and even the Propaganda, leading to the issuing of an interdiction of the Compagnie du Saint-Sacrement by Cardinal Mazarin in 1660.Asia in the Making of Europe, p.232 In spite of these events, the King, the Assembly of the French Clergy, the Compagnie du Saint-Sacrement and private donors accepted to finance the effort, and the three bishop managed to depart, although they now had to travel on land. The three bishops chosen for Asia left France (1660‚Äì62) to go to their respective missions, and crossed Persia and India on foot, since Portugal would have refused to take non-Padroado missionaries by ship, and the Dutch and the English refused to take Catholic missionaries. Mgr Lambert left Marseilles on 26 November 1660, and reached Mergui in Siam 18 months later, Mgr Pallu joined Mgr Lambert in the capital of Siam Ayutthaya after 24 months overland, and Mgr Cotolendi died upon arrival in India on 6 August 1662. Siam thus became the first country to receive the evangelization efforts of the Paris Foreign Missions Society, to be followed by new missions years later in Cochinchina, Tonkin and parts of China. =Founding principles= Chapel of the Paris Foreign Missions Society. The mission had the objective of adapting to local customs, establishing a native clergy, and keeping close contacts with Rome. In 1659, instructions were given by the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith (known as the \\"Propaganda\\"): Instructions were also given to the effect that respecting the habits of the countries to be evangelized was paramount, a guiding principle of the Missions ever since: =Establishment Rue du Bac, Paris= The Paris Foreign Missions Society in 1663. Turgot). The Chapel at the Paris Foreign Missions Society, established in 1691. Louis XIV commemorative medal of the first stone of the Mission, 1683. The Seminary (S√©minaire des Missions √âtrang√®res) was created in March 1663. Msgr Jean Duval, ordained under the name Bernard de Sainte Th√©r√®se and nominated Bishop of Babylon (modern Iraq) in 1638, offered the deserted buildings of his own Seminary for Missions to Persia, which he had created in 1644 at 128 Rue du Bac. On 10 March 1664, Father Vincent de Meur was nominated as the first Director of the Seminary, and officially became Superior of the Seminary on 11 June 1664. The Seminary was established so that the society might recruit members and administer its property, through the actions of the Compagnie du Saint-Sacrement and by the priests whom the vicars Apostolic had appointed their agents. This house, whose directors were to form young priests to the apostolic life and transmit to the bishops the offerings made by charity, was, and still is situated in Paris in the Rue du Bac. Known from the beginning as the Seminary of Foreign Missions, it secured the approval of Pope Alexander VII, and the legal recognition of the French Government and Louis XIV in 1663. In 1691 the chapel was established, and in 1732 the new, larger, building was completed. Another wing, perpendicular to the 1732 one, was added in the 19th century to accommodate the great increase in members of the Seminary. 1658‚Äì1800 The chief events of this period were: the publication of the book Institutions apostoliques, which contains the germ of the principles of the rule, the foundation of the general seminary in Ayutthaya, SiamThe Cambridge History of Southeast Asia By Nicholas Tarling, p.191 (the Seminary of Saint Joseph,Asia in the Making of Europe, p.249 at the origin of the College General now in Penang, Malaysia), the evangelization of Tonkin, Cochinchina, Cambodia, and Siam, where more than 40,000 Christians were baptized, the creation of an institute of Vietnamese nuns known as \\"Lovers of the Cross\\", the establishment of rules among catechists, and the ordination of thirty native priests. Between 1660 and 1700 about 100 missionaries were sent to Asia. =Siam= The Siamese embassy to Louis XIV, led by Kosa Pan in 1686, was a result of the missionary efforts of the Paris Foreign Missions Society. Mgr Louis Laneau of the Paris Foreign Missions Society (on the right, forefront)Les Missions Etrangeres, p.54 was closely involved in the contacts with the Siamese king Narai. Here, the French ambassador Chevalier de Chaumont presents a letter from Louis XIV to King Narai in 1685. The Paris Foreign Missions Society started its work in Siam, with the establishment of a base in its capital Ayutthaya. Siam was known to be highly tolerant of other religions and was the only country in Southeast Asia where the Catholic fathers could establish a base safely.Les Missions Etrangeres, p.45 With the agreement of the Siamese king Narai, the Seminary of Saint Joseph was established, which could educate Asian candidate priests from all the countries of the Southeast Asian peninsula. A cathedral was also constructed. The College remained in Siam for a century, until the conquest of Siam by Burma in 1766. The missionary work also had political effects: through their initiative a more active trade was established among Indo-China, the Indies, and France; embassies were sent from place to place; and treaties were signed. In 1681, Jacques-Charles de Brisacier was elected superior of the organization. In 1681 or 1682, the Siamese king Narai, who was seeking to reduce Dutch and English influence, named the French medical missionary Brother Ren√© Charbonneau, a member of the Siam mission, as Governor of Phuket . Charbonneau held the position of Governor until 1685.New Terrains in Southeast Asian History, p.294, Abu Talib In 1687 a French expedition to Siam took possession of Bangkok, Mergui, and Jonselang. France came close to ruling an Indo-Chinese empire, though it failed following the 1688 Siamese revolution, which adversely affected the missions. Msgr Louis Laneau of the Society was involved in these events. He was imprisoned by the government for two years, with half of the members of the Seminar, until he was allowed to resume his activities. In 1702, Artus de Lionne, Bishop of Rosalie, and missionary of the Paris Foreign Missions Society, brought Arcadio Huang to France as one of the first Chinese men there. He established the basis for the study of the Chinese language in France. In the second half of the 18th century, the Society was charged with the missions which the Jesuits had possessed in India prior to suppression of the order in Portugal. Many of the Jesuits remained in Asia. The missions took on a new life, especially in Sichuan, under bishops Pottier and Dufresse, and in Cochinchina. =Cochinchina= Mgr Pigneau de Behaine acted as a diplomatic agent for the Vietnamese Prince Nguy·ªÖn Ph√∫c √Ånh (the future Gia Long). In Cochinchina, Mgr Pigneau de Behaine acted as an agent for Nguy·ªÖn Ph√∫c √Ånh, a pretender to the throne, in making a treaty with France (the 1787 Treaty of Versailles). Pigneau de Behaine assisted Nguy·ªÖn Ph√∫c √Ånh in obtaining the support of several French soldiers and officers, modernizing his army, and ultimately gaining victory over the T√¢y S∆°n. =French revolution= At the end of the 18th century, the French Revolution halted the growth of the society, which had previously been very rapid. At that time it had six bishops, a score of missionaries, assisted by 135 native priests; in the various missions there were nine seminaries with 250 students, and 300,000 Christians. Each year the number of baptisms rose on an average of 3000 to 3500; that of infant baptisms in articulo mortis was more than 100,000. Nineteenth century Departure ceremony at the Paris Foreign Missions Society. Le D√©part, 1868, by Charles Louis de Fredy de Coubertin. On 23 March 1805, Napoleon signed a decree reinstating the Paris Foreign Missions Society.Les Missions Etrangeres, p.135. Article No1 of the decree: \\"Les √©tablissements des Missions, connus sous la d√©nomination des Missions √©trang√®res, et le s√©minaire du Saint-Esprit sont r√©tablis\\". In 1809 however, following a conflict with the Pope, Napoleon cancelled his decision. The Missions would be firmly re-established through a decree by Louis XVIII in March 1815.Les Missions Etrangeres, p.135 Several causes contributed to the rapid growth of the Society in the 19th century; chiefly the charity of the Propagation of the Faith and the Society of the Holy Childhood. Each bishop received annually 1200 francs, each mission had its general needs and works allowance, which varied according to its importance, and could amount to from 10,000 to 30,000 francs. 1856 departures of MEP missionaries. 1864 departures of MEP missionaries. The four on the left would become martyrs in Korea. The second cause was persecution. Fifteen missionaries died in prison or were beheaded during the 17th and 18th centuries and the beginning of the 19th century; but after that those killed among the missionaries were very numerous. (See Martyr Saints of China). Altogether, about 200 MEP missionaries died of violent death. Among them 23 were beatified, of whom 20 were canonized,Website of the College General: with an additional 3 in 2000. Authors such as Chateaubriand, with his G√©nie du christianisme, also contributed to the recovery of the militant spirit of Catholicism, after the troubles of the French Revolution.Les Missions Etrangeres, p.137 By 1820, the territory of the Missions, which included India since the prohition of the Company of Jesus (the Jesuits) in 1776, extended to Korea, Japan, Manchuria, Tibet, Burma, Malaysia etc... In the 19th century, the local persecutions of missionary priests of the Paris Foreign Missions Society was often a pretext for French military intervention in Asia, based on the doctrine of the Protectorate of missions. These persecutions were described in Europe by books, pamphlets, annals, and journals, inspiring numerous young men either with the desire for martyrdom or that of evangelization. They played a part in inspiring European nations, especially France and England, to intervene in Indochina and China. Another cause of the progress of the missionaries was the ease and frequency of communication in consequence of the invention of steam and the opening of the Suez Canal. A voyage could be made safely in one month which formerly required eight to ten months amid many dangers. In Vietnam, the persecutions of numerous priests such as Pierre Borie or Augustin Schoeffer was used as a justification for the armed interventions of Jean-Baptiste C√©cille and Rigault de Genouilly, ultimately leading to the occupation of Vietnam and the creation of French Indochina. In Korea, the beheading of Sim√©on-Fran√ßois Berneux and other priests justified the 1866 French Campaign against Korea. =Vietnam= Martyrdom of Joseph Marchand in Vietnam in 1835. In 1825, emperor Minh M·∫°ng, the son and successor of Gia Long, prohibited foreign missionaries in Vietnam, on the grounds that they perverted the people. The prohibition proved largely ineffective, as missionaries continued their activities in Vietnam, and participated in armed rebellions against Minh M·∫°ng, as in the L√™ VƒÉn Kh√¥i revolt (1833‚Äì1835). He banned Catholicism completely, as well as French and Vietnamese priests (1833‚Äì1836), leading to persecutions of French missionaries.Dragon Ascending By Henry Kamm p.86 These included the martyrdom of Joseph Marchand in 1835 or Pierre Borie in 1838. These events served in France to stoke a desire among young men to intervene and protect the Catholic faith. Martyrdom of Saint Pierre Borie, 24 November 1838, in Tonkin, Vietnam. Vietnamese painting. Ming Man's successor, Thi·ªáu Tr·ªã, upheld the anti-Catholic policy of his predecessor. In 1843, the French Foreign Minister Fran√ßois Guizot sent a fleet to Vietnam under Admiral Jean- Baptiste C√©cille and Captain Charner,.Chapuis, p.5 Google Book Quote: \\"Two years later, in 1847, Lefebvre was again captured when he returned to Vietnam. This time Cecille sent captain Lapierre to Da Nang. Whether Lapierre was aware or not that Lefebvre had already been freed and on his way back to Singapore, the French first dismantled masts of some Vietnamese ships. Later on April 14, 1847, in only one hour, the French sank the last five bronze-plated vessels in the bay of Da Nang. The action also was related to the British successes in China in 1842, and France hoped to be able to establish trade with China from the south. The pretext was to support British efforts in China, and to fight the persecution of French missionaries in Vietnam.Tucker, p.27 In 1847, C√©cille sent two warships (Gloire and Victorieuse) under Captain Lapierre to Da Nang (Tourane) in Vietnam to obtain the release of two imprisoned French missionaries, Bishop Dominique Lef√®bvre (imprisoned for a second time as he had re-entered Vietnam illegally) and Duclos, and freedom of worship for Catholics in Vietnam.Tucker, p.28 As negotiations drew on without results, on April 15, 1847 a fight named the Bombardment of ƒê√† N·∫µng erupted between the French fleet and Vietnamese ships, three of which were sunk as a result. The French fleet sailed away. Other missionaries were martyred during the reign of Emperor T·ª± ƒê·ª©c, such as Augustin Schoeffer in 1851 and Jean Louis Bonnard in 1852, prompting the Paris Foreign Missions Society to ask the French government for a diplomatic intervention.Les Missions Etrangeres, p.12 In 1858, Charles Rigault de Genouilly attacked Vietnam under the orders of Napoleon III following the failed mission of diplomat Charles de Montigny. His stated mission was to stop the persecution of Catholic missionaries in the country and assure the unimpeded propagation of the faith.Tucker, p.29 Rigault de Genouilly, with 14 French gunships, 3,000 men and 300 Filipino troops provided by the Spanish,A History of Vietnam, Oscar Chapuis p.195 attacked the port of Da Nang in 1858, causing significant damage, and occupying the city. After a few months, Rigault had to leave due to problems with supplies and illnesses among many of his troops.Tucker, p.29 Sailing south, De Genouilly captured Saigon, a poorly defended city, on 18 February 1859. This was the beginning of the French conquest of Cochinchina. Martyrdom of Jean-Charles Cornay, 1837. Ten martyrs of the M.E.P. were canonized by John-Paul II, 19 June 1988, as part of 117 martyrs of Vietnam, including 11 Dominican Fathers, 37 Vietnamese priests, and 59 Vietnamese laics: * Fran√ßois-Isidore Gagelin (1833) * Joseph Marchand (1835) * Jean-Charles Cornay (1837) * Fran√ßois Jaccard (1838) * Bishop Pierre Borie, vicar apostolic of Western Tonking (1838) * Augustin Schoeffler (1851) * Jean-Louis Bonnard (1852) * Pierre- Fran√ßois N√©ron (1860) * Th√©ophane V√©nard (1861) * Bishop √âtienne-Th√©odore Cuenot, vicar apostolic of Eastern Cochinchina (1861) Image:Native Priests in Occidental Tonkin.jpgNative priests of the Paris Foreign Missions Society, in western Tonkin.

Died of malnutrition in Vietnam in 1856. =Korea= Laurent-Joseph-Marius Imbert of the Paris Foreign Missions Society, Saint, martyred in Korea (21 September 1839). In the mid-19th century that the first western Catholic missionaries began to enter Korea. This was done by stealth, either via the Korean border with Manchuria or the Yellow Sea. These French missionaries of the Paris Foreign Missions Society arrived in Korea in the 1840s to proselytize to a growing Korean flock that had in fact independently introduced Catholicism into Korea but needed ordained ministers. 1839 persecutions On 26 April 1836, Laurent-Joseph-Marius Imbert of the Paris Foreign Missions Society was appointed Vicar Apostolic of Korea and Titular Bishop of Capsa. On 14 May 1837, he was ordained Titular Bishop of Capsa and crossed secretly from Manchuria to Korea the same year. On 10 August 1839, Bishop Imbert, who was secretly going about his missionary work, was betrayed. He was taken to Seoul where he was tortured to reveal the whereabouts of foreign missionaries. He wrote a note to his fellow missionaries, Fathers Pierre-Philibert Maubant and Jacques-Honor√© Chastan, asking them to surrender to the Korean authorities as well. They were taken before an interrogator and questioned for three days to reveal the names and whereabouts of their converts. As torture failed to break them down, they were sent to another prison and beheaded on 21 September 1839 at Saenamteo. Their bodies remained exposed for several days but were finally buried on Noku Mountain. 1866 persecutions Sim√©on Berneux. Bishop Sim√©on-Fran√ßois Berneux, appointed in 1856 as head of the infant Korean Catholic church, estimated in 1859 that the number of Korean faithful had reached nearly 17,000. At first the Korean court turned a blind eye to such incursions. This attitude changed abruptly, however, with the enthronement of King Gojong in 1864. By the time the Heungseon Daewongun assumed de facto control of the government in 1864 there were twelve French Paris Foreign Missions Society priests living and preaching in Korea and an estimated 23,000 native Korean converts. Bishop Berneux of the Paris Foreign Missions Society was tortured and then beheaded on March 7, 1866.Source In January, 1866 Russian ships appeared on the east coast of Korea demanding trading and residency rights in what seemed an echo of the demands made on China by other western powers. Native Korean Christians, with connections at court, saw in this an opportunity to advance their cause and suggested an alliance between France and Korea to repel the Russian advances, suggesting further that this alliance could be negotiated through Bishop Berneux. The Heungseon Daewongun seemed open to this idea, though it is uncertain whether this was ruse to bring the head of the Korean Catholic Church out into the open. Berneux was summoned to the capital, but upon his arrival in February 1866, he was seized and executed. A roundup then began of the other French Catholic priests and native converts. Pierre Henri Dori√© of the Paris Foreign Missions Society, also martyred in Korea in 1866. As a result of the Korean dragnet all but three of the French missionaries were captured and executed: among them were Bishop Sim√©on Berneux, Bishop Antoine Daveluy, Father Just de Breteni√®res, Father Louis Beaulieu, Father Pierre Henri Dori√©, Father Pierre Auma√Ætre, Father Luc Martin Huin, all of them members of the Paris Foreign Missions Society and canonized by Pope John Paul II on 6 May 1984. An untold number of Korean Catholics also met their end (estimations run around 10,000),\\"It is estimated than 10,000 were killed within a few months\\" Source many being executed a place called Jeoldu-san in Seoul on the banks of the Han River. In late June 1866 one of the three surviving French missionaries, Father Felix- Claire Ridel, managed to escape via a fishing vessel and make his way to Tianjin, China in early July 1866. Fortuitously in Tianjin at the time of Ridel's arrival was the commander of the French Far Eastern Squadron, Rear Admiral Pierre-Gustave Roze. Hearing of the massacre and the affront to French national honor, Roze determined to launch a punitive expedition, the French Campaign against Korea, 1866. Ten martyrs of the M.E.P. were canonized by John-Paul II, 6 May 1984, as part of 103 canonized martyrs of Korea, including Andr√© Kim Tegong, the first Korean priest, and 92 Korean laics: * Bishop Laurent Imbert (21 September 1839) * Pierre Maubant (21 September 1839) * Jacques Chastan (21 September 1839) * Bishop Sim√©on Berneux (8 March 1866) * Just de Breteni√®res (8 March 1866) * Louis Beaulieu (8 March 1866) * Pierre- Henri Dorie (8 March 1866) * Bishop Antoine Daveluy (30 March 1866) * Pierre Auma√Ætre (30 March 1866) * Martin-Luc Huin (30 March 1866) =China= Paris Foreign Missions Society Fathers in China in 1860.

Martyred in China in 1862. =Japan= MEP Fathers and Seminarists in Southern Japan in 1881. After the suppression of Christianity in Japan from around 1620 and nearly two century of strictly enforced seclusion thereafter, various contacts occurred from the middle of the 19th century as France was trying to expand its influence in Asia. After the signature of the Treaty of Nanking by Great Britain in 1842, both France and the United States tried to increase their efforts in the Orient. The first attempts at resuming contacts occurred with the Ry≈´ky≈´ Kingdom (modern Okinawa), a vassal of the Japanese fief of Satsuma since 1609. In 1844, a French naval expedition under Captain Fornier-Duplan onboard Alcm√®ne visited Okinawa on April 28, 1844. Trade was denied, but Father Forcade of the Paris Foreign Missions Society was left behind with a Chinese translator, named Auguste Ko. Forcade and Ko remained in the Temple of Amiku, city of Tomari, under strict surveillance, only able to learn the Japanese language from monks. After a period of one year, on May 1, 1846, the French ship Sabine, commanded by Gu√©rin, arrived, soon followed by La Victorieuse, commanded by Rigault de Genouilly, and Cl√©op√¢tre, under Admiral C√©cille. They came with the news that Pope Gregory XVI had nominated Forcade Bishop of Samos and Vicar Apostolic of Japan.The Dublin Review, Nicholas Patrick Wiseman C√©cille offered the kingdom French protection against British expansionism, but in vain, and only obtained that two missionaries could stay. Mgr Petitjean, of the Paris Foreign Missions Society, first effective Vicar Apostolic of Japan. Forcade and Ko were picked up to be used as translators in Japan, and father Leturdu was left in Tomari, soon joined by Father Mathieu Adnet. On July 24, 1846, Admiral C√©cille arrived in Nagasaki, but failed in his negotiations and was denied landing, and Bishop Forcade never set foot in mainland Japan.Religion in Japan: Arrows to Heaven and Earth By Peter Francis Kornicki, James McMullen (1996) Cambridge University Press, , p.162 The Ryu- Kyu court in Naha complained in early 1847 about the presence of the French missionaries, who had to be removed in 1848. France would have no further contacts with Okinawa for the next 7 years, until news came that Commodore Perry had obtained an agreement with the islands on July 11, 1854, following his treaty with Japan. France sent an embassy under Rear-Admiral C√©cille onboard La Virginie in order to obtain similar advantages. A convention was signed on November 24, 1855. As contacts between France and Japan developed during the Bakumatsu period (on the military side this is the period of the first French military mission to Japan), Japan was formed into a unique Vicariate Apostolic from 1866 until 1876. The Vicariate was administered by Mgr Petitjean, of the Paris Foreign Missions Society (1866‚Äì1884).The Catholic Encyclopedia ‚Äì Page 754 by Charles George HerbermannJapan's Hidden Christians, 1549-1999 By Stephen Turnbull 20th century The following table shows the state of the missions at the turn of the 20th century: { class=wikitable - valign=top  Missions of Japan and Korea ** Tokio ** Nagasaki ** Osaka ** Hakodate ** Korea =Total number of= * Catholics, 138,624 * churches or chapels, 238 * bishops and missionaries, 166 * native priests, 48 * catechists, 517 * seminaries, 4 * seminarists, 81 * communities of men and women, 44, containing 390 persons * schools, 161, with 9024 pupils * orphanages and work-rooms, 38, with 988 children * pharmacies, dispensaries, and hospitals, 19  Missions of China and Tibet ** Western Sichuan ** Eastern Sichuan ** Southern Sichuan ** Yunnan ** Guizhou ** Guangdong ** Guangxi ** Southern Manchuria ** Northern Manchuria =Total number of= * Catholics, 272,792 * churches or chapels, 1392 * bishops and missionaries, 408 * native priests, 191 * catechists, 998 * seminaries, 19 * seminarists, 661 * communities of men and women, 23, with 222 members * schools, 1879, with 31,971 pupils * orphanages and work-rooms, 132, with 4134 children * pharmacies, dispensaries, and hospitals, 364   Missions of Eastern Indo- China  ** Tongking ** Cochinchina ** Cambodia = Total number of = * Catholics, 632,830 * churches or chapels, 2609 * bishops and missionaries, 365 * native priests, 491 * catechists, 1153 * seminaries, 14 * seminarists, 1271 * communities of men and women, 91, with 2538 persons * schools, 1859, with 58,434 pupils * orphanages and work-rooms, 106, with 7217 children * pharmacies, dispensaries, and hospitals, 107  Missions of Western Indo- China ** Siam ** Malacca ** Laos ** Southern Burma ** Northern Burma =Total number of= * Catholics, 132,226 * churches or chapels, 451 * bishops and missionaries, 199 * native priests, 42 * catechists, 242 * seminaries, 3 * seminarists, 81 * communities of men and women, 47, with 529 members * schools, 320, with 21,306 pupils * orphanages and work-rooms, 132, with 3757 children * pharmacies, dispensaries, and hospitals, 86  Missions of India ** Pondicherry ** Mysore ** Coimbatore ** Kumbakonam =Total number of= * Catholics, 324,050 * churches or chapels, 1048 * bishops and missionaries, 207 * native priests, 67 * catechists, 274 * seminaries, 4 * seminarists, 80 * communities of men and women, 54, with 787 members * schools, 315, with 18,693 pupils * orphanages and work-rooms, 57, with 2046 children * pharmacies, dispensaries, and hospitals, 41 } A sanatorium for sick missionaries was established in Hong Kong (B√©thanie);Restoration of B√©thanie: now the home of Emmanuel Church - Pokfulam, Hong Kong another in India among the Nilgiri mountains, and a third in France.

With producers Joe Keenan and Christopher Lloyd (Frasier's producers) at the helm, the show was about a family of five doctors who had little in common and usually did not get along. CBS officially cancelled it on May 17, 2006, at its upfront presentation.  Plot Ben Barnes is the youngest son and central character. As a marriage counselor and the only non-physician, the rest of his family sees him as a lesser doctor. His wife left him in the pilot episode. Ben's father, Stewart Barnes, is a gastroenterologist who is happy to be free from the influence of his ex-wife, Lydia Barnes (Stockard Channing in her third sitcom starring role following Stockard Channing in Just Friends and The Stockard Channing Show), a status-conscious cardiologist and mother of their three children. Ben's brother, Oliver Barnes, is a self-centered plastic surgeon and committed womanizer. Their sister, Regina Barnes, is a lesbian E.R. doctor, who like Oliver, is infatuated with attractive women. She is addicted to the action found inside an ER. Crystal, Stewart's girlfriend and receptionist, is a source of frustration and awkwardness for all except Stewart. Tilly was a late addition to the cast and is not seen much in the pilot.

The series was pulled from the schedule along with Courting Alex due to low ratings. Episodes Reception =Awards= In early July 2006, it was announced that Channing was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series for her work on Out of Practice. Broadcast =International airings= Beginning in April 2008, the show was broadcast on Comedy Central Poland at a rate of three episodes per week. The series was also shown in Australia, at 6:30pm Saturdays from October 2006; however the series attracted low audience shares, and was consequently taken off after five weeks. It reappeared in mid-2007 in a late-night timeslot, where it completed its run. In Autumn of 2006 it was aired on AVALA in Serbia daily, with a re-run in 2007. In 2013, AVALA lost its national frequency. =Syndication= As of December 2009, the show is being broadcast on Universal HD. The show's full 22 episodes are available to view as part of Amazon's streaming service.

In addition to its focus on anti-war issues, it has taken action on issues such as drones, Guantanamo Bay prison, Palestinian statehood, the Iran nuclear deal, Saudi Arabia, and Women Cross DMZ.

With members wearing the group's signature pink color, Code Pink has conducted marches, protests, and other actions in order to promote its goals. Although women initiated and lead the group, Code Pink encourages people of all genders to participate in its activities. History Code Pink protests Democratic senators who supported Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen, December 2017 Code Pink was founded on November 17, 2002 by Americans Jodie Evans, Medea Benjamin and other activists. The group's name is a play on the United States Department of Homeland Security's color-coded alert system in which, for example, Code Orange and Code Red signify the highest levels of danger. In February 2003, just weeks before the invasion of Iraq, Code Pink organized its first trip to that nation, and subsequently led five delegations there. These delegations included parents who had lost their children in Iraq, and parents of active soldiers. Additionally, they brought six Iraqi women on a tour of the United States, and published a report about how the U.S. occupation affected the status of Iraqi women.

The group has been criticized for actions at the vigils for tactics such as displaying coffins and chanting aggressive slogans. Speaking about the display of coffins, Kevin Pannell, an amputee and former patient at the hospital, said it \\"was probably the most distasteful thing I had ever seen. Ever. We went by there one day and I drove by and [the anti-war protesters] had a bunch of flag-draped coffins laid out on the sidewalk. You know that 95 percent of the guys in the hospital bed lost guys whenever they got hurt and survivors' guilt is the worst thing you can deal with.\\" To those that faulted aggressive chants and signs, Code Pink responded that certain of the disruptive protesters were not part of their group and that they have asked these protesters to be respectful. Code Pink says that the purpose of the vigils is to highlight the lack of care for veterans and claims that the vigils have helped spur improvements in that care. =Tucker Carlson interview= In 2007, talk-show host Tucker Carlson criticized Pink leader Medea Benjamin for her support of Venezuelan President Hugo Ch√°vez. Benjamin was quoted as saying that the charge in sections of the US media that Ch√°vez had cracked down on free speech and civil rights in Venezuela was a myth. In an interview on Carlson's MSNBC show, Benjamin was asked, \\"Do you want to revise that given the news that Hugo Ch√°vez has closed the last nationally broadcast opposition television station for criticizing him?\\" Benjamin replied that it was untrue and that Ch√°vez simply did not renew the license because the station \\"participated in a coup against a democratically elected government, his [Chavez's] government.\\" Benjamin also said \\"Peru recently did not renew a license. Uruguay didn't renew a license. Why do you hold Venezuela to a different standard?\\" Carlson responded that a 360-page Venezuelan government-published book accused RCTV of showing lack of respect for authorities and institutions. Carlson asked Benjamin, \\"I would think, as a self-described liberal, you would stand up for the right of people to 'challenge authorities and institutions.' And yet you are apologizing for the squelching of minority views. Why could that be?\\" Benjamin replied, \\"They [RCTV] falsified information. They got people out on the street. They falsified footage that showed pro-Chavez supporters killing people, which did not happen. They refuse to cover any of the pro-Chavez demonstrations.\\" =Ground the Drones= In the summer of 2009, Code Pink began their \\"Ground the Drones\\" campaign. This campaign was a response to the Obama administration's continued and increased use of unmanned drones in the \\"war on terror,\\" specifically in regions surrounding Pakistan and Afghanistan. Code Pink claimed that many of the drone strikes intended to target terrorist leaders and strongholds often miss their targets, causing the unnecessary deaths of innocent civilians. \\"Ground the Drones\\" was fashioned as a form of non-violent, civil disobedience, similar to protests earlier that spring, by groups such as Voices for Creative Non Violence. Code Pink targeted Creech Air Force base in Indian Springs, Nevada, claiming it was the ‚Äúepicenter‚Äù for controlling drone activity. The goal of the protest was \\"halting unmanned aircraft strikes controlled via satellite links from Creech and other bases.\\" The group continued protesting at Creech AFB through November and December 2009. Code Pink returned to Creech AFB in October 2011, along with other protest groups, to mark the 10th anniversary of the occupation of Afghanistan. Protesters dubbed it the \\"largest anti-war demonstration ever at Creech Air Force Base. In August 2013, Code Pink's national coordinator, Alli McCracken, disrupted the annual Aerial Unmanned Vehicles Systems Integrated summit, in Washington, DC. During a speech advocating the full automation of unmanned drones, McCracken interrupted by shouting ‚ÄúAre you going to talk about the innocent people who have been killed by the drones?,‚Äù while producing a \\"STOP KILLER DRONES\\" banner, until she was escorted out by security. In November 2013, Code Pink organized a \\"Ground the Drones\\" summit. The summit took place over two days and was held at Georgetown University, in Washington, D.C. The summit featured films pertaining to drone warfare, as well as a variety of guest speakers from various human rights and civil liberties organizations. Topics of the summit included ethical and legal arguments surrounding drone warfare, as well as concerns over the use of drones domestically. \\"Ground the Drones\\" has also attempted to involve American citizens in the fight to end drone warfare. Code Pink's website advises readers to take action by, among other ways, contacting their local representatives, organizing film- screenings, and distributing pamphlets. =Halloween 2009 White House protest= On October 31, 2009, Code Pink organized a protest rally outside the White House to coincide with President Barack Obama's official Halloween party. As many of the guests were family members of military personnel, the Code Pink press release encouraged attendees to dress as \\"zombie soldiers\\".Code Pink Press Release Accessed 21 Dec 2009 The event gained some notoriety when complaints surfaced about Reuters' characterization of their protest as \\"taunting\\" children, a characterization that Reuters stood by.Reuters Reader Feedback Forum Accessed 21 Dec 2009 =Gaza activities= Code Pink has organized more than seven delegations to Gaza, some of them at the invitation of the United Nations. Critics have since accused Code Pink of working \\"closely with terrorist organizations and states sponsors of terrorism\\" in Gaza and Iran.Code Pinks trip to Iran is a peace delegation in name only, The Jerusalem Post Prior to the Gaza Freedom March, Code Pink endorsed the ‚ÄúCairo Declaration to End Israeli Apartheid\\", which calls for comprehensive boycott of Israel.http://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2010/01/01/18633996.php Gaza Freedom Marchers issue the \\"Cairo Declaration\\" to end Israeli Apartheid During the Gaza Freedom March, Code Pink co-founder Medea Benjamin coordinated the organization's stay with the Hamas terrorist group. Members resided in the Commodore, a Hamas-owned hotel in Gaza City.

Amira Hass referred to the event as \\"an opportunity for Hamas cabinet ministers to get decent media coverage in the company of Western demonstrators.\\" Code Pink helped to organize an International Women's Day Delegation to Gaza in March 2014. Upon arrival at the Cairo airport on March 3, 2014, Medea Benjamin was detained and assaulted by Egyptian authorities. She was deported to Turkey after the authorities had dislocated her shoulder.https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/05/world/middleeast/medea-benjamin- cairo-airport.html Other members of the international delegation, including American, French, Belgian, and British citizens, who arrived the next day were also deported. Some members made it into Cairo, although no one from the delegation made it to Gaza. = Protests: NRA, Syria and Islamic State = Code Pink protesters were present at the National Rifle Association's (NRA) first press conference following the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, where NRA's Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre advocated placing armed guards in schools and said \\"The only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is with a good guy with a gun.\\"CODEPINK Protesters Unfurl Banners ‚ÄúNRA KILLING OUR KIDS‚Äù and ‚ÄúNRA BLOOD ON YOUR HANDS‚Äù at first NRA Press Conference after Newtown Shooting , Code Pink: Women for Peace, Published December 21, 2012 About ten activists of Code Pink demonstrated in U.S. Congress against military attacks in retaliation for Syria's suspected use of chemical weapons against its own people.

Senator McCain restored order and called for the Sergeant at Arms and the Capital Hill Police to escort Code Pink out of the building and called after them \\"Get out of here you lowlife scum!\\" Code Pink member Desiree Fairooz was arrested for laughing after a description of Senator Jeff Sessions by Alabama U.S. Senator Richard Shelby of the nominee as having a history of his \\"treating all Americans equally under the law is clear and well-documented,\\" during the January 2017 confirmation hearing as United States Attorney General. After she had been convicted at trial, that verdict was reversed by the chief District Court Judge Robert Morin. The judge said Fairooz should not have been tried for laughing, only for speaking out as she was being removed, and called a mistrial. Instead of dismissing the case, Morin set her retrial for September.Judge throws out conviction for Code Pink activist arrested after laughing during Jeff Sessions' confirmation, Washington Examiner, Josh Siegel, July 14, 2017.

On November 6, 2017, District of Columbia U.S. Attorney Jessie K. Liu filed a notice of nolle prosequi in the case against Desiree Fairooz. Upon the decision, Code Pink released a statement calling the 3 trials a waste of time and tens of thousands of taxpayer dollars, adding, \\"These sentences are designed to discourage dissent and prevent activists from engaging in the daily protests that are taking place during a tumultuous time.\\" From the January 20th protests of the inauguration of Donald Trump, the United States Department of Justice is prosecuting 200 people on multiple felony charges. =Support of Iranian weapons programs= In March 2019 while visiting Iran, Code Pink representatives voiced support for Iran's developing missile technology, saying that \\"since the US has military bases around Iran, it is Iran‚Äôs right to upgrade its defense capability\\". =Occupation of the Venezuelan embassy in Washington, D.C.= During the 2019 Venezuelan presidential crisis, the US Government broke relations with the Nicol√°s Maduro administration and recognized Juan Guaid√≥ as the acting president of Venezuela. On 10 April 2019, after the Maduro administration retired his diplomats from the Venezuelan embassy in Washington, US activists from Code Pink received keycards from the diplomats, moved into the building, and secured all entrances with chains and locks as Carlos Vecchio, Guaid√≥'s ambassador appointed to the US, tried to gain access to the building. The US government considers the embassy as property of Guaid√≥'s interim government. Clashes in May 2019 between US activists and pro-Guaid√≥ Venezuelan demonstrators resulted in arrests on both sides. US authorities issued an eviction notice on the group on May 14. The last four activists were removed from the embassy by agents from the US State Department's Diplomatic Security Service and the US Secret Service on May 16. At the end of July 2019, some members of Code Pink that occupied the embassy visited Venezuela during the Foro de S√£o Paulo. Maduro posed for pictures with the group and rewarded them with gifts, including a book on Sim√≥n Bol√≠var and a replica of Bolivar's sword. =National day of action to withdraw US troops from Iraq= Following the assassination of Qasem Soleimani, leader of Iran's Quds Force, and of Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, leader of Iraq's Popular Mobilization Forces by a US drone attack at Baghdad airport, Code Pink together with a number of other civil society groups called for a \\"national day of action\\" in 30 large US cities to request the withdrawal of US troops from Iraq. Thousands marched in over 80 cities across the country to protest against a possible war against Iran.

It runs from the California border, south of Brookings, to the Washington state line on the Columbia River, between Astoria, Oregon, and Megler, Washington. US 101 is designated as the Oregon Coast Highway No. 9 (see Oregon highways and routes), as it serves the Oregon Coast region. Much of the highway runs between the Pacific Ocean and the Oregon Coast Range, thus US 101 is frequently mountainous in character. For most of its length it is a two-lane undivided highway. Many parts of the highway are subject to closure due to landslides caused by excessive rainfall, and in many parts of the coast, US 101 is the only viable route connecting certain coastal communities. Thus, in many cases when landslides block US 101, the detour requires traveling inland over the Coast Range to alternative north-south routes in the Willamette Valley and then back west over the Coast Range again. US 101 is often the main street through coastal towns in Oregon, which can cause significant traffic delays. This is especially true in Lincoln City, where geography and tourism combine to create traffic problems. Route description =Brookings to Coos Bay= The run of US 101 in Oregon (from south to north) starts at the border with California, south of the twin cities of Brookings and Harbor (and north of Crescent City, California). The highway is mostly a two-lane road, running along the Southern Oregon coastline. Access to this section (other than 101) is via U.S. Route 199 or Oregon Route 42. Access is also possible through National Forest Route 23 (NF-23 - Bear Camp) but that route is not maintained through the winter months. Other coastal towns in this stretch of US 101 include Pistol River, Gold Beach, Wedderburn, and Port Orford. North of Port Orford is the Cape Blanco region, and the westernmost point in the U.S. Highway system. After passing through Sixes, Denmark, and Langlois, US 101 enters the resort town of Bandon on the mouth of the Coquille River. Just north of Bandon, the highway crosses the river on the Bullards Bridge. The stretch of US 101 between Brookings and Gold Beach includes the highest bridge in Oregon, the Thomas Creek Bridge. With its roadbed at above Thomas Creek, is the 15th highest bridge in the U.S. North of Bandon, US 101 heads inland for a while, while a spur route provides access to the Charleston Peninsula. Approaching the city of Coos Bay, US 101 becomes an expressway after an interchange with Oregon Route 42, then soon enters the downtown core. It continues through Coos Bay (the city) along the western edge of Coos Bay (the bay), soon entering the city of North Bend. North of North Bend, it crosses over the bay on the Conde McCullough Memorial Bridge, followed by a second bridge over Haynes Inlet. =Coos Bay to Lincoln City= View from Cape Perpetua lookout of Highway 101 winding along the Oregon coast south of Cape Perpetua. North of Coos Bay, the highway runs along the eastern flank of the Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area, through the communities of North Bend, Hauser, Lakeside, and Winchester Bay before coming into the city of Reedsport on the mouth of the Umpqua River. The highway continues north from there, passing through the dunes and through the towns of Gardiner, Westlake, Dunes City, and Glenada. The next major town is Florence on the Siuslaw River. The next stretch of US 101 (between Florence and Newport) closely follows the coastline, providing a wide view of the ocean. Towns between these two cities include Yachats, Waldport, and Seal Rock. Eventually, the highway crosses the Yaquina Bay Bridge into Newport. Just before the bridge lies the Oregon Coast Aquarium; on the other side of the bridge is the famed Newport waterfront. Also in Newport, US Route 20 has its western Terminus at US 101. The next stretch of 101, between Newport and Lincoln City, is rather mountainous, as the Coast Range protrudes into the ocean. Cities on the route include Depoe Bay, Otter Rock (accessible via a side road), and the Gleneden Beach/Salishan area, famed for its resorts. Near Siletz Bay is the abandoned community of Kernville, followed by Lincoln City. =Lincoln City to Astoria= US 101 through downtown Seaside US 101 at the Astoria-Megler Bridge, heading north. US 101 & Business 101 Sign The stretch of US 101 through Lincoln City is infamous for its clogged traffic; the city is over seven miles (11 km) long (but only a few blocks wide in spots), and is sandwiched between the ocean on the west, and Devils Lake and mountains to the east. In many parts of town, the highway is a two-lane road. Adding to the traffic is a casino in the northern part of town. Much of the traffic departs US 101 north of Lincoln City, at an interchange with Oregon Route 18. North of Lincoln City is the town of Neskowin and the Nestucca Bay area. A side road, the Three Capes Scenic Route, provides access to the seaside towns of Pacific City and Sandlake, then goes over Cape Lookout and on to Netarts, Oceanside and Cape Meares before meeting 101 again at Tillamook. 101 instead heads inland, passing through the towns of Cloverdale, Hebo, Beaver and Hemlock. The next major town is the city of Tillamook. North of Tillamook, the highway passes on the eastern shore of Tillamook Bay, through towns such as Bay City and Garibaldi, before reuniting with the ocean. It then continues north along the Pacific through towns such as Rockaway Beach and Nedonna Beach; the next major towns are Nehalem and Manzanita, both on Nehalem Bay. The highway then continues north along the coastline through rugged terrain until it reaches the city of Cannon Beach. Unlike most coastal cities in Oregon, a bypass (in two-lane freeway configuration) was built around Cannon Beach; US 101 follows the bypass alignment. A few miles north of Cannon Beach is an interchange with U.S. Route 26, followed by the city of Seaside. (Until recently, U.S. 26 continued north towards Astoria, sharing an alignment with US 101; however ODOT truncated U.S. 26 to its current terminus at the interchange with 101 several years ago.) North of Seaside, US 101 follows the coastal plain through cities such as Gearhart; a spur route (Oregon Route 104) provides access to Fort Stevens State Park. US 101 soon enters the city of Warrenton, Oregon (where Business 101, which is more of a scenic route, providing access to the Astoria-Warrenton Airport, Fort Clatsop, and Miles Crossing) and then crosses Youngs Bay into Astoria, Oregon. 101 passes through the northwestern edge of Astoria, until an intersection with the western terminus of U.S. Route 30. At this intersection, 101 climbs an access road onto the Astoria-Megler Bridge over the Columbia River, and crosses into the state of Washington. History US 101 was established in 1926 and replaced several earlier state highways. In 1966, Oregon legislators proposed adding US 101 or a parallel corridor to the Interstate Highway System as part of road upgrades between Coos Bay and Astoria. In 2015, all of US 101 in Oregon was designated as the Persian Gulf, Afghanistan, and Iraq Veterans Memorial Highway by the state legislature.

It was a popular work when it appeared, running through several editions.Sarah Anderson, Anderson's Travel Companion: A Guide to the Best Non-fiction and Fiction for Travelling. Brookfield, Vt., 1995. (p. 355). The book relates Borrow's travels through Spain while working as a Bible salesman Wim Willems, In Search of the True Gypsy: From Enlightenment to Final Solution. Routledge, 2014. (pp. 102-4). between 1835 and 1838, during the Carlist Civil War. His activities were on behalf of the Bible Society, and encountered much opposition from the Roman Catholic Church and many national and local politicians.Carr, 1966, pp. 46, 174. Content Borrow's book, \\"a song of wild Spain\\", was based on journals and notes he kept at the time, upon which he also drew for his reports back to the Bible Society which were returned to him on his request when he was working on the book.Thomas, 1912, Chapter XX--The Bible in Spain. His travels began at Lisbon, from where he journeyed on horseback via Elvas and Badajoz to Madrid. There he negotiated with government ministers, including Prime Ministers Mendiz√°bal and Ist√∫riz, for permission to print and distribute a Spanish translation of the New Testament. In this he had the support of the British ambassador George Villiers. Borrow went on to travel through northern Spain distributing copies of this work, and appointing local agents where possible. On returning to Madrid he opened a bookshop for sale of the work, but this was soon closed down by the authorities. He next printed his own translation of St. Luke's Gospel in the Cal√≥ language of the Iberian Romani people. He was briefly imprisoned in Madrid. During his Spanish travels he suffered from bouts of illness and twice returned to England, and in the end his activities were suppressed and he left Spain for Tangier, where the book closes. The work relates numerous personal encounters Borrow had with Spaniards, from the prime minister to beggars, including Gypsies and crypto- Jews.Thomas, 1912, Chapter XXI--The Bible in Spain: Characters. This was the first widely read book with accurate first-hand information on Gypsies (though a more complete description is found in his first work The Zincal√≠ [1841], which was not a commercial success). Reception The book brought money and recognition for Borrow. It went into six editions in the first year, one of which sold 10,000 copies within four months. It also sold well in the United States, and was translated into French and German.Thomas, 1912, Chapter XXIII --Between the Acts. The book's popularity in Protestant countries at the time was presumably due to its evangelical enthusiasm, as well as the romantic image of Spain; whereas its continuing interest at the present time arises more from its powerful portrayal of a diversity of people, places and incidents. A contemporary reviewer expected that readers would be \\"amused by the lively sketches ... along with the author's odd adventures, and the queer positions in which he often placed himself\\". For this reviewer the book is \\"in the first rank of entertaining and even of informing books\\", although in Borrow's \\"off-hand, free-and-easy\\" encounters with a wide range of colourful characters he seems frequently to be pursuing an object at variance with \\"one that could be contemplated by a Bible Society's agent\\". Borrow's account in the book (Chapters 51-57) of his unscheduled expedition to Gibraltar and Tangier makes it \\"clear that he was pursuing a private agenda, a dream of discovery about Gypsies, Jews, and Moors\\".Batalden, Cann & Dean, 2004, p. 298. For Edward Thomas (1912), Borrow presented himself in a heroic light, without vanity. Borrow's writing style in the book is \\"effective\\", conveying \\"half theatrical and wholly wild exuberance and robustness\\", even though it \\"runs at times to rotten Victorianism, both heavy and vague\\" and shows the influence of Biblical phraseology. Borrow often breaks up his own narrative with \\"life- like\\" dialogue that \\"can hardly be over-praised\\"; the effect is not marred by the many insertions of untranslated Spanish words and phrases. Thomas concludes that \\"as always for a good writer, the whole is greater than the mere sum of the parts\\".Thomas, 1912, Chapter XXII--The Bible in Spain: Style. Herbert Read, in his book English Prose Style (1928) cites Borrow's The Bible in Spain as an example of \\"the virtues of a good narrative style.\\"Read, p. 128. For the historian Raymond Carr (1966), Borrow's \\"strange masterpiece\\" is of especial historical value, against the shortage of \\"orthodox sources\\" for Spanish history at that period.Carr, 1966, p. 713-4. This is seen, for example, in the \\"splendid eyewitness account\\" (on p. 135-140) of the bravery of the military officer Vicente Genaro de Quesada in the face of a hostile crowd.Carr, 1966, p. 169. Influence The success of The Bible in Spain helped to promote public interest in Britain in the work of colporteurs, who distribute religious works, and this activity became a major focus for the Bible Society in the mid-19th century.Batalden, Cann & Dean, 2004, p. 34. The description of Gypsy life in the final chapter of Prosper M√©rim√©e's novella Carmen (the source for Bizet's opera) shows many similarities with those in Borrow's The Bible in Spain and The Zincali. M√©rim√©e was familiar with Borrow's writings and commented on them. In the Footsteps of George Borrow by Guy Arnold () is a travel book in which the author retraces the steps of Borrow's journey as related in The Bible in Spain. According to Edward Weeks, in his Forward to Richard Soule‚Äôs Dictionary of English Synonyms, James Hall, the co-author of The Bounty Trilogy, ‚Äú‚Ä¶decided to make the voyage from Tahiti to Pitcairn Island‚Ä¶and knowing that he would have many days at sea, he took with him Borrow‚Äôs The Bible in Spain‚Ä¶.‚Äù Notes References  * External links *The Bible in Spain, published by the Project Gutenberg.

Figueroa, who was five months pregnant at the time, was reported missing on July 18, 2005 after she failed to show up to work. She was later found strangled to death after being featured on America's Most Wanted.LaToyia Figueroa . America's Most Wanted, July / August 2005 Police discovered Figueroa's remains in a grassy, partially wooded lot in Chester, Pennsylvania, located 13 miles south of Philadelphia. They arrested Stephen Poaches, the father of her unborn child, on August 20, more than a month after she was reported missing.Missing Philadelphia Woman Is Found Dead On October 17, 2006, Poaches was convicted of two counts of first-degree murder for the deaths of Figueroa and her unborn child.Man guilty of murdering girlfriend who refused abortion The disappearance of Figueroa sparked controversy about media coverage because cable news channels, such as CNN, MSNBC, and Fox News Channel, neglected to cover her story in favor of Natalee Holloway, a Caucasian teen missing on the island of Aruba.Missing Woman's Case Spurs Discussion of News Coverage Some observers protested that Figueroa's case was similar to the Laci Peterson case (which also covered the same timespan) and thus deserved greater attention, implying that race was a factor in the lack of coverage. Details of the case On July 18, 2005, 24 years old and five months pregnant, LaToyia went to a prenatal checkup with the father of her unborn child, 25 year old Stephen Poaches. Afterward they went to his apartment. Poaches later stated that LaToyia had left his home \\"peaceably\\" around 5pm however, LaToyia did not pick up her 7-year-old daughter that evening nor did she show up for her shift at the restaurant where she worked. After she was reported missing, Poaches told police that he knew nothing about LaToyia's disappearance and did not participate in any search efforts. Poaches then called a radio station to defend himself against suspicion. In the weeks following her disappearance, detectives searched Poaches's home and car and found no evidence of a crime. Police also did not find any evidence of credit card use or cellphone activity by Latoyia and thus she was categorized by police officials as a missing person. Her father, Melvin Figueroa organized on his own, search teams throughout the city for weeks following her disappearance. As relatives and friends papered the city with flyers, a reward for information reached $100,000 which included donations from the restaurant where she worked and Philadelphia rapper, Beanie Sigel . It was reported that police and the media took almost two weeks to focus any meaningful attention to her case prior to TV host Nancy Grace began to do nationally televised reporting on her disappearance. Well over a month after her disappearance, police detectives received a tip from an acquaintance of Poaches stating that he had contacted them the evening prior asking to borrow a truck and inquiring about a body bag. Police then followed Poaches from his home to a grassy, partially wooded lot in Chester, 13 miles outside of Philadelphia. He was wearing a bulletproof vest and carrying a gun. There police discovered LaToyia's remains. Poaches was arrested and a judge ruled that prosecutors had enough evidence to try him on 2 counts of 1st degree murder for Latoyia and their unborn child. Police stated that Poaches had strangled Latoyia hours after returning from the pre- natal appointment. The Figueroa case bears a similarity to the case of Laci Peterson, who was found dead and whose husband, Scott, was found guilty of her murder. The Peterson case was covered heavily throughout 2004 and led to public consensus that Scott Peterson was guilty of the murder. Figueroa's family stated that the lack of media coverage of her disappearance only brought more tragedy to an already troubled search. Figueroa's mother, Ann Taylor, was murdered when LaToyia was a toddler. Figueroa had a seven-year-old daughter. Joseph Taylor, Figueroa's uncle and family spokesman, has actively criticized the media. America's Most Wanted and the Philadelphia Citizen Crime Commission teamed up with police to aid in the search. A $100,000 reward was funded by rap stars Beanie Sigel (while in a prison) and Damon Dash, Beneficial Bank, T.G.I.

Media coverage controversy The disappearance of Figueroa has spawned controversy about media coverage of missing people and how cases get national attention, with the terms \\"Missing White Women Syndrome.\\" PBS journalist Gwen Ifill referred to the phenomenon as \\"The Missing White Woman Syndrome\\" at the Unity Convention of Journalists in 2004 This phrase was invoked by Professor of American Studies Sheri L. Parks on March 13, 2006 during an interview with American news reporter, Anderson Cooper to describe a phenomenon characterized by critics as a short and cynical equation: Pretty, white damsels in distress draw viewers; missing women who are black, Latino, Asian, old, fat, or ugly do not. Critics accused major news outlets of ignoring Figueroa's disappearance to focus on cases involving young, usually attractive, white women like Laci Peterson who was also pregnant when she was reported missing. Several internet bloggers began writing about the inadequate coverage cable news networks gave to missing people of color and pressured them to give equal coverage of non-white young American women like Natalee Holloway and Jennifer Wilbanks; they succeeded in gaining attention and Figueroa's case received coverage by major news outlets such as CNN, MSNBC, and Fox News Channel. Conservative blogger Michelle Malkin, referred to this phenomenon as \\"Pretty Girl Syndrome\\" and said, \\"I'm embarrassed that there's so much air time absorbed by the latest missing-girl story.\\" References External links * *CNN coverage of Latoyia *USA Today Coverage of LaToyia *Website critical of media coverage of missing people *PoliticsPhilly.com Reports Category:2005 murders in the United States Category:American people of Puerto Rican descent Category:People from Philadelphia Category:People murdered in Pennsylvania Category:Murdered African-American people Category:Deaths by strangulation in the United States Category:2005 in Pennsylvania ","title":"Murder of LaToyia Figueroa"},{"id":"2440633","text":"Joaqu√≠n Xaudar√≥ y Echau (August 17, 1872 - April 1, 1933) was a Spanish cartoonist, illustrator, and caricaturist.

A twenty-year- old undergraduate studying philosophy at Balliol College, Oxford, Moss became jammed underground, from the entrance after descending a narrow unexplored shaft in Peak Cavern, a famous cave system in Castleton in Derbyshire at March 22, 1959. Initial attempts to haul him free failed because the rope broke several times. When he lost consciousness as carbon dioxide from his own respiration built up in the base of the shaft, he was unable to assist further rescue attempts made with a stronger rope. More rescue efforts were made: June Bailey gave up after six hours, \\"driven back by foul air,\\" and caving veteran Bob Leakey, in a wetsuit, could not get to him. Moss never regained consciousness and was declared dead on the morning of Tuesday, March 24, after the final rescue attempt had failed. His father, wishing to avoid further injury or loss of life in an attempt to retrieve his body, requested that it be left in place. The fissure was sealed with loose rocks from the floor of the chamber and an inscription was later placed nearby. This section of Peak Cavern is now known as Moss Chamber. There are many media reports of the fissure being filled with cement although this is not actually the case, as has been reported at a later date by a number of people who were participants in the rescue. It was thought that he became stuck because he had moved a boulder at the bottom which had trapped the ladder, thus preventing him being pulled up by rescuers. The distance between the rungs of the ladder was too great for someone of his height to reach through the remaining gap. The story of Moss's death was widely publicised and appeared also in American newspapers and Australian newspapers; it was retold in the novel One Last Breath (2004) by Stephen Booth. In 2006, filmmaker Dave Webb ‚Äì a Derbyshire caver himself ‚Äì produced a DVD on the story titled Fight For Life - The Neil Moss Story.

It was discovered 16 October 1979, by Nikolai Chernykh at Crimean Astrophysical Observatory in Nauchnyj, on the Crimean peninsula. It was named after the Italian astronomer Claudio Maccone.  Orbit and classification  Claudiomaccone orbits the Sun in the (central) main-belt at a distance of 2.0‚Äì3.2 AU once every 4 years and 2 months (1,512 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.23 and an inclination of 4¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. Claudiomaccone comes closer to Mars than to the other planets, repeatedly approaching the Red Planet as close as . In 2096 it makes a very rare approach to 65 Gm. A first precovery was taken at Palomar Observatory in 1950, extending the body's observation arc by 29 years prior to its official discovery observation.  Physical characteristics  = Diameter and albedo = According to the survey carried out by NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, Claudiomaccone measures 3.203 kilometers in diameter and its surface has a high albedo of 0.432, while the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a standard albedo for stony S-type asteroids of 0.20 and calculates a diameter of 4.30 kilometers with an absolute magnitude of 14.2. = Photometry = In November 2004, a rotational lightcurve of Claudiomaccone was obtained from photometric observations by Ukrainian astronomer Yurij N. Krugly, using the 0.7-meter telescope at Chuguev Observation Station () and the 1-meter telescope at Simeiz Observatory. Lightcurve analysis gave a rotation period of 3.1872 hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.15 magnitude (). An identical period with an amplitude of 0.12 magnitude, was also published by Petr Pravec in 2006. After the binary nature of Claudiomaccone was announced (see below), follow-up observations by a group of French, Swiss and Italian astronomers (including Claudio Maccone) in 2008 and 2012, gave a period 3.1873 and 3.18701 hours with an amplitude of 0.16 and 0.12 magnitude, respectively (). = Satellite = The obtained photometric observations from 2004, also revealed that Claudiomaccone is an asynchronous binary system with a minor-planet moon orbiting it every 15.11 hours. An identical orbital period is also given by Pravec. The discovery was announced in December 2005, and the moon was provisionally designated . Based on a secondary to primary mean-diameter ratio of larger than 0.31, the moon's diameter is estimated to be at least 1.24 kilometers. Its orbit around Claudiomaccone has an estimated semi-major axis of 6 kilometers.  Naming  This minor planet was named after Claudio Maccone (born 1948), an Italian SETI astronomer and space scientist at Thales Alenia Space in Turin, Italy. In his book The Sun as a Gravitational Lens: Proposed Space Missions he proposed the construction and launch of a spacecraft‚Äìantenna, called the FOCAL space mission. Outside the Solar System, at a distance of 550 AU, FOCAL could have a significantly better sensitivity detecting radio signals due to the Sun's magnifying gravitational lensing effect, as predicted by general relativity. The official naming citation was published on 2 September 2001 (). In 2012, he succeed American astronomer Seth Shostak as chairman of the SETI Permanent Committee at the International Academy of Astronautics.

This enzyme covalently attaches an acetyl group from acetyl-CoA to chloramphenicol, which prevents chloramphenicol from binding to ribosomes. A histidine residue, located in the C-terminal section of the enzyme, plays a central role in its catalytic mechanism. The crystal structure of the type III enzyme from Escherichia coli with chloramphenicol bound has been determined. CAT is a trimer of identical subunits (monomer Mr 25,000) and the trimeric structure is stabilised by a number of hydrogen bonds, some of which result in the extension of a beta- sheet across the subunit interface. Chloramphenicol binds in a deep pocket located at the boundary between adjacent subunits of the trimer, such that the majority of residues forming the binding pocket belong to one subunit while the catalytically essential histidine belongs to the adjacent subunit. His195 is appropriately positioned to act as a general base catalyst in the reaction, and the required tautomeric stabilisation is provided by an unusual interaction with a main-chain carbonyl oxygen.  Application  CAT is used as a reporter system to measure the level of a promoter or its tissue-specific expression. The CAT assay involves monitoring acetylation of radioactively labeled chloramphenicol on a TLC plate; CAT activity is determined by looking for the acetylated forms of chloramphenicol, which have a significantly increased migration rate as compared to the unacetylated form.

In 1943, he participated in an operation to destroy a German air control tower. This mission was compromised when he and his fellow soldiers, seeking a trusted resistance contact, accidentally made contact with a civilian who betrayed them to the Nazis. The film was directed by Arne Skouen and is based on the book We Die Alone by David Howarth. Republished 2007 by the Lyons Press. In 1958, the film was nominated for an Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film and was entered into the Cannes Film Festival. In 1991, Norwegian television audiences voted it the greatest Norwegian film ever made.  Plot  The morning after their blunder, the resistance fighters' boatcontaining 8 tons of explosives intended to destroy the air control toweris attacked by a German vessel. The Norwegians destroy their boat by exploding their payload, and Baalsrud and some other surviving soldiers flee. They swim ashore in ice cold Arctic waters, and Baalsrud is the only one to escape the Nazi onslaught. Soaking wet and missing one shoe, he escapes up a ravine, and shoots and kills a Gestapo officer. Baalsrud evades capture for roughly two months, suffering from frostbite and snow blindness. He fails in his bid to reach the border of neutral Sweden and throws himself on the mercy of some Norwegian citizens who happen to have access to the Norwegian underground. While hiding in their barn, he amputates many of his own frostbitten toes with an ordinary knife. These citizens manage to move Baalsrud close to the Swedish border, but are forced to leave him in a snow cave for roughly two weeks before they return and deliver him to a reindeer herder, who finally takes him over the frontier to safety. Baalsrud recuperates in a Swedish hospital for seven months, then returns to England through South Africa, Asia, Australia, New Zealand, and America before rejoining the fight.

Its status as a Catholic Order was confirmed in a Papal Bull of 15 March 1728 specifically comparing the Order with the Teutonic Order, which had likewise been transformed from a Crusading Order to an exclusive chivalric religious institution for the Nobility. Establishment There are rumors that the order was founded as early as the twelfth century, or by Emperor Maximilian I, but historical records do not support these claims. The Order was founded by Elector Charles Albert, son of Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria, who had died before establishing the order. Charles founded the order on April 24, 1729. The decision to found it may have been in part the consequence of the failed attempt by the Wittelsbachs to acquire the Grand Magistery of the Sacred Military Constantinian Order of Saint George, which by decision of the Holy See in 1701 was recognized as pertaining to the Italian Farnese dynasty. The tradition of loyalty to the patron saint of chivalry, Saint George, was long established in Germany, and various Bavarian Princes who in the fifteenth century had made pilgrimages to the Holy Sepulcher and were there invested as knights had each made a promise to Saint George. Maximilian's son, the Elector Karl-Albrecht, gave the new Order its title of Order of the Holy Knight and Martyr Saint George and the Immaculate Conception of the Holy Virgin Mary and established its statutes on March 28, 1729 as a Military Order of Chivalry for Roman Catholic noblemen. By a reform of 1741, a clerical class was introduced, also limited to noblemen, including a Bishop, Provosts, four Deans, and Chaplains. The statutes in forty articles dedicate the members to an ardent Christian devotion unparalleled among institutions founded in the eighteenth century, the age of the Enlightenment. They require that the knights \\"must honour God above all else; You must be strong in faith in Our Lord Jesus Christ, honor your Sovereign Lord, love and respect him and his royal prerogatives\\" and replicate promises made at the Tomb. Order in 19th and 20th centuries In reforming the various military and noble Orders, he confirmed the privileges already enjoyed by the knights of Saint George, giving them precedence after the knights of Saint Hubert. By a new Constitution of 25 February 1827, Maximilian's son and successor, Ludwig I declared that the King was always to be Grand Master, the Crown Prince the first Grand Prior and other Princes of the Bavarian Royal House second Grand Priors. These statutes, which have remained largely in force, established six Grand Commanders, twelve hereditary commanders, and unlimited knights. The requirements have always been formidable as originally members had to prove thirty two quarterings with thirty-four noble German ancestors, but since the 1871 reforms the requirement has been revised to proof of four hundred years of nobility in each of the four quarters and proof that all thirty-two great-great-great grandparents were noble, still rigidly enforced. The statutes were again revised on 11 December 1999 (approved by the present Head of the House, Duke Franz, on 11 January 2000), suppressing the separate clerical class (priests may join the Order as regular members, provided they have the necessary nobiliary qualifications) and simplified the regulations. They have to be at least twenty-one years of age and before admission, are examined by a committee of knights. There was originally a special \\"zungen\\" (langue or tongue) of foreign knights, who could comprise up to one third of the total membership, and did not have to prove German ancestry, but this no longer exists. The last King of Bavaria continued to maintain the Order after abdicating his throne and was succeeded by his son, Rupprecht, Crown Prince of Bavaria. The present Grand Master of the Order is Franz Herzog von Bayern who succeeded his father, Duke Albrecht in 1996. Unlike all the other noble Orders the rules requiring noble proofs are strictly enforced and there is no category of \\"honorary\\" or \\"grace\\" knights. The Order is dedicated to the practice of works of charity, and the establishment of hospitals and until recently maintained a hundred-bed hospital. There are about ninety members and the Order celebrates its feast days on Saint George's Day (24 April) and the Feast of the Immaculate Conception (8 December). The coadjutor Grand Master and first Grand Prior is Prince Max, Duke in Bavaria, and the Princes Luitpold, Wolfgang, Christoph and Leopold of Bavaria are Grand Priors (2013). Insignia A Renaissance reliquary of St. George in the Treasury of the Munich Residenz is prominently displayed on the high altar of the Royal Chapel during ceremonies of the order. The badge of the Order is a blue enamelled gold Maltese cross with white enamelled borders with small gold balls on the points and blue diagonal lozenges between the arms also with white enamelled borders. Each of these lozenges bears a gold letter, V. I. B. I., representing the words Virgini Immaculatae Bavaria Immaculata (\\"Immaculate Bavaria for the Immaculate Virgin\\"). The round gold medallion in the center has the image of the Virgin Mary within a white enamelled border. The reverse of the badge has the same design except that the arms of the cross are enamelled red, the blue lozenges bear the letters I. V. P. F., representing the words Justis Vt Palma Fiorebit (\\"Distinguished for Justice and Glory\\") and the center gold medallion is of Saint George slaying the Dragon within a green enamelled laurel wreath. The badge hangs from a light blue silk moire ribbon with white stripes near its border with narrow dark blue stripes on the inside of these white stripes by means of a suspension link in the form of a gold lion's head holding in its mouth a blue reverse crescent shaped handle of the gold and enamel strapwork supporting the badge proper. The officials of the order wore a special heraldic cross, a Maltese cross like the former, but with its round central medallion bearing the red cross of St. George on a white background and on its upper and lower arms a gold lion rampart on black background (i.e., the arms of the Electorate of the Palatinate) and on the right and left arms three blue lozenges on a white background (i.e., the arms of the Duchy of Bavaria). Between the arms of the cross are lozenges bearing the letters I. V. I. B. on a blue background, but without the white enameled borders. This cross hangs from the same gold lion‚Äôs head suspension cross as the badge of the order. The star is a Maltese cross like the badge but in silver instead of gold, the arms being also blue with white borders, but with four blue and white alternating lozenges between each of the arms and with the red cross of Saint George on a white background as its centre medallion. On formal occasions the badge is worn by the members of the first class of the order (i.e., Grand Master, Grand Priors and Grand Commanders) from a gold collar formed of links in 1. the form of a gold rectangle, each bearing two or three letters of the motto of the order, IN FIDE JUSTITIA ET FORTITUDINE (\\"In faith, justice and fortitude\\"), with gold Bavarian royal crowns on the either side of this rectangle, between red enameled flames emitting from blue enameled strapwork on both the upper and lower sides of this link, alternating with links in 2. the form of two gold lions rampart combatant standing on a gold scroll, each supporting with one forepaw a central white enameled column surmounted by a gold orb and cross, the lion on the left holding a torch in its right forepaw and the lion on the right holding a sword in its left forepaw. Separating these alternating links and alternating with each of them are links 3. in the form of two lozenges, one above the other, with each lozenge subdivided into four blue and white lozenges (from the arms of Bavaria); i.e., 1-3-2-3-1-3, etc. The Formal Habit of the First Class In the ceremonies of the first class of the order used to wear a formal habit consisting of a white satin tunic embroidered down the front and around the bottom hem in silver thread with a design of conjoined pairs of oak and olive wreaths, alternating with olive branches, with similar embroidery on the sleeves and the star of the order embroidered on the left breast. Over this was worn a steel blue velvet mantle with the same design of conjoined wreaths and olive branches embroidered in silver thread on the hem and collar of the mantle as on the tunic and the star of the order embroidered on the left breast, over which they wore the collar of the order. At present, the first class wear the collar of the order over a steel blue velvet calf length mantle without any embroidery except for the star of the order on the left breast on such occasions.

History The original conservatory, the Potawatomi Greenhouse, was built by Lord & Burnham in the 1920s and was originally built as eight growing houses to raise plants for South Bend city parks and conservatories and floral shows in the region. The Ella Morris Conservatory and Muessel-Ellison Botanical Conservatory were built in the 1960s. The Desert Dome was built in 1973. Today, the conservatories are part of Potawatomi Park, which includes the Potawatomi Zoo. In 2006, the Conservatories were almost closed due for financial reasons, specifically government budget cuts and the costs for heating the spaces. In response, the Botanical Society of South Bend took over management of the facilities. The facilities closed for renovations in 2011, which cost an estimated $1.2 million. Renovations included updating the heating, plumbing and electrical systems. The facilities also received wall repairs, new paint, windows and floors, ADA compliant bathrooms, a new potting room, and a mechanical room. The latter three updates added 1,600 square feet to the facilities. A new parking lot, sidewalk, and signage were also installed. The facilities reopened in May 2012. Gardens The Muessel- Ellison Botanical Conservatory has introduced species including birds of paradise and bougainvillea. The Ella Morris Conservatory focuses on tropical and subtropical flora. Finally, the Desert Dome focuses on cacti, succulents and other desert plants from the Sonoran Desert, including a monkey puzzle tree.

In this way, dendrotoxins prolong the duration of action potentials and increase acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction, which may result in muscle hyperexcitability and convulsive symptoms. Dendrotoxin structure 3D model of alpha-dendrotoxin. colored in red are positively charged amino acid residues in the N-terminus and the Œ≤-turn region that are believed to be important for potassium channel binding. Dendrotoxins are ~7kDa proteins consisting of a single peptide chain of approximately 57-60 amino acids. Several homologues of alpha-dendrotoxin have been isolated, all possessing a slightly different sequence. However, the molecular architecture and folding conformation of these proteins are all very similar. Dendrotoxins possess a very short 310-helix near the N-terminus of the peptide, while a two turn alpha-helix occurs near the C-terminus. A two-stranded antiparallel Œ≤-sheet occupies the central part of the molecular structure. These two Œ≤-strands are connected by a distorted Œ≤-turn regionKatoh E, Nishio H, Inui T, Nishiuchi Y, Kimura T, Sakakibara S, Yamazaki T (2000). Structural Basis for the Biological Activity of Dendrotoxin-I, a Potent Potassium Channel Blocker. Biopolymers 54:44-57 that is thought to be important for the binding activity of the protein. All dendrotoxins are cross-linked by three disulfide bridges, which add stability to the protein and greatly contribute to its structural conformation. The cysteine residues forming these disulfide bonds have been conserved among all members of the dendrotoxin family, and are located at C7-C57, C16-C40, and C32-C53 (numbering according to alpha-dendrotoxin). The dendrotoxins are structurally homologous to the Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitors, including bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI). Alpha- dendrotoxin and BPTI have been shown to have 35% sequence identity as well as identical disulfide bonds. Despite the structural homology between these two proteins, dendrotoxins do not appear to exhibit any measurable inhibitory protease activity like BPTI. This loss of activity appears to result from the absence of key amino acid residues that produce structural differences that hinder the key interactions necessary for the protease activity seen in BPTI. Dendrotoxins are basic proteins that possess a net positive charge when present in neutral pH. Most of the positively charged amino acid residues of dendrotoxins are located in the lower part of the structure, creating a cationic domain on one side of the protein. Positive charge results from lysine (Lys) and arginine (Arg) residues that are concentrated in three primary regions of the protein: near the N-terminus (Arg3, Arg4, Lys5), near the C-terminus (Arg54, Arg55) and at the narrow Œ≤-turn region (Lys28, Lys29, Lys30).Swaminathan P, Hariharan M, Murali R, Singh CU (1996). Molecular Structure, Conformational Analysis, and Structure-Activity Studies of Dendrotoxin and Its Homologues Using Molecular Mechanics and Molecular Dynamics Techniques. Journal of Medicinal Chemistry. 39:2141-2155 It is believed that these positively charged residues can play a critical role in dendrotoxin binding activity, as they can make potential interactions with the anionic sites (negatively charged amino acids) in the pore of potassium channels. Biological activity =Pharmacology= A single dendrotoxin molecule associates reversibly with a potassium channel in order to exert its inhibitory effect. It is proposed that this interaction is mediated by electrostatic interactions between the positively charged amino acid residues in the cationic domain of dendrotoxin and the negatively charged residues in the ion channel pore. Potassium channels, similar to other cation-selective channels, are believed to have a cloud of negative charges that precede the opening to the channel pore that help conduct potassium ions through the permeation pathway. It is generally believed (though not proven) that a dendrotoxin molecules bind to anionic sites near the extracellular surface of the channel and physically occlude the pore, thereby preventing ion conductance. However, Imredy and MacKinnonImredy JP, and MacKinnon R (2000). Energetic and Structural Interactions between delta-Dendrotoxin and a Voltage- gated Potassium Channel. Journal of Molecular Biology 296:1283-1294 have proposed that delta-dendrotoxin may have an off-center binding site on their target proteins, and may inhibit the channel by altering the structure of the channel, rather than physically blocking the pore. =Biologically important residues= Many studies have attempted to identify which amino acid residues are important for binding activity of dendrotoxins to their potassium channel targets. Harvey et al.Harvey AL, Rowan EG, Vatanpour H, Engstrom A, Westerlund B, Karlsson E (1997). Changes to biological activity following acetylation of dendrotoxin I from Dendroaspis polylepis (black mamba). ' 35:1263-1273 used residue-specific modifications to identify positively charged residues that were crucial to the blocking activity of dendrotoxin-I. They reported that acetylation of Lys5 near the N-terminal region and Lys29 in the beta-turn region led to substantial decreases in DTX-I binding affinity. Similar results have been shown with dendrotoxin-K using site-directed mutagenesis to substitute positively charged lysine and arginine residues to neutral alanines. These results, along with many others, have implicated that the positively charged lysines in the N-terminal half, particularly Lys5 in the 310-helix, play a very important role in the dendrotoxin binding to their potassium channel targets. The lysine residues in the Œ≤-turn region has provided more confounding results, appearing to be biologically critical in some dendrotoxin homologues and not necessary for others. Furthermore, mutation of the entire lysine triplet (K28-K29-K30) to Ala-Ala-Gly in alpha- DTX resulted in very little change in biological activity. There is a general agreement that the conserved lysine residue near the N-terminus (Lys5 in alpha-DTX) is crucial for the biological activity of all dendrotoxins, while additional residues, such as those in the beta-turn region, might play a role in dendrotoxin specificity by mediating the interactions of individual toxins to their individual target sites. This not only helps explain the stringent specificity of some dendrotoxins for different subtypes of voltage-gated K+ channels, but also accounts for differences in the potency of dendrotoxins for common K+ channels. For example, Wang et al.Wang FC, Bell N, Reid P, Smith LA, McIntosh P, Robertson B, and Dolly JO (1999). Identification of residues in dendrotoxin K responsible for its discrimination between neuronal K+ channels containing KV1.1 and 1.2 alpha subunits. European Journal of Biochemistry 263:222-229 showed that the interaction of dendrotoxin-K with KV1.1 is mediated by its lysine residues in both the N-terminus and the Œ≤-turn region, while alpha-dendrotoxin appears to interact with its target solely through the N-terminus. This less expansive interactive domain may help explain why alpha- dendrotoxin is less discriminative while dendrotoxin-K is strictly selective for KV1.1. Uses in research Potassium channels of vertebrate neurons display a high degree of diversity that allows neurons to precisely tune their electrical signaling properties by expression of different combinations of potassium channel subunits. Furthermore, because they regulate ionic flux across biological membranes, they are important in many aspects of cellular regulation and signal transduction of different cell types. Therefore, voltage-gated potassium channels are targets for a wide range of potent biological toxins from such organisms as snakes, scorpions, sea anemones, and cone snails. Thus, venom purification has led to the isolation of peptide toxins such as the dendrotoxins, which have become useful pharmacological tools for the study of potassium channels. Because of their potency and selectivity for different subtypes of potassium channels, dendrotoxins have become useful as molecular probes for the structural and functional study of these proteins. This may help improve our understanding of the roles played by individual channel types, as well as assist in the pharmacological classification of these diverse channel types.Yoshida S and Matsumoto S (2005). Effects of alpha-dendrotoxin on K+ currents and action potentials in tetrodotoxin-resistant adult rat trigeminal ganglion neurons. Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics 314:437-445 Furthermore, the availability of radiolabelled dendrotoxins provides a tool for the screening of other sources in a search for new potassium channel toxins, such as the kalicludine class of potassium channel toxins in sea anemones. Lastly, the structural information provided by dendrotoxins may provide clues to the synthesis of therapeutic compounds that may target particular classes of potassium channels. Dendrotoxin I has also been used to help purify and characterize the K+ channel protein to which it binds via different binding assay and chromatography techniques.

Cootehill was formerly part of the neighbouring townland of Munnilly. Both townlands lie within the barony of Tullygarvey. The English language name of the town is a portmanteau of \\"Coote\\" and \\"Hill\\", the family names of a local 18th century landowning family. Name The town's Irish name, Muinchille, derives from the Irish language term meaning a ridge or \\"sleeve\\". The town's name in English, Cootehill, is a portmanteau attributed to the intermarriage of the landowning Coote and Hill families in the early 1700s. This involved the marriage of Thomas Coote (1655‚Äì1741) and Frances Hill from Hillsborough, County Down, who were involved in the linen trade. The Coote family of Cootehill had some notable members, including the aforementioned Thomas Coote who was a Cromwellian Colonel and a judge of the Court of King's Bench during the 18th century. Other Cootes served as sheriffs and under-sheriffs in the 19th century. Thomas Coote's grandson was Charles Coote, 1st Earl of Bellomont. History Cootehill was formally established as a market town in 1725 when Thomas Coote obtained a charter to hold markets and fairs; thereafter strong ties to the Irish linen industry were cultivated. A description from 1844 states: \\"The town is comparatively well-built and respectively inhabited; and is not equaled in appearance by any place between it and Dublin except Navan.\\"Parliamentary Gazetteer of Ireland available at LDS libraries. Randell, 1844. Online source The Cootehill of this era has a link to communist and labour history, in that a branch of the International Workingmen's Association (IWA) was established in Cootehill in 1872. This followed the establishment of branches in Dublin, Cork, and Belfast.The Origins of Modern Irish Socialism, 1881-1896 By Fintan Lane (page 23) Prominent people who have visited the town over the years have included President Mary McAleese, who visited in 2002 to open Damien House near Dartrey Forest. Bertie Ahern, then Taoiseach, visited the town in 2006. Arthur Griffith founder of Sinn F√©in and later President of D√°il √âireann was elected here in 1918, and Rev. John Wesley, a founder of the evangelical and Methodist movement, visited the town in the mid-18th century. Eoghan Ruadh √ì N√©ill camped and trained the Ulster Army in Munnilly, in the 1640s during the Irish Confederate Wars. Heritage and culture Market Street, Cootehill 1905 The dominant architectural style reflects the 18th and 19th centuries, with a number of Georgian buildings in the town centre. The town has several architecturally notable buildings, including an office with an arched sandstone facade, built for the Provincial Bank (later AIB Bank) in 1858 and designed by architect William G Murray. It stands at the far end of Market Street, and is next door to the Church of Ireland church, built 1819. Within 90 metres stands the renovated St. Michaels Roman Catholic Chapel. The Cootehill Court House is also nearby and was designed and built in 1832 by William Deane Butler. There are also examples of Modern and Postmodern architecture, such as the Cootehill Post Office. The Market house was demolished in the 1960s. Cootehill workhouse and infirmary, was built in 1841-2, designed by George Wilkinson to accommodate up to 800 inmates and a fever hospital was added in 1846 during the Great Famine. It was closed in 1917 after serving as an asylum for a few years and demolished in the 1960s. One of the main estate houses in the area, Bellamont Forest, was built between 1725 and 1730 for Thomas Coote, the Lord Justice of Ireland. It was designed by Coote's nephew, architect Edward Lovett Pearce. Pearce's other works include the former Houses of Parliament in College Green in Dublin, now the Bank of Ireland. He later became Surveyor General of Ireland, a post which he held until his death in 1733. Considered one of the finest Palladian villa ever built in Ireland, Bellamont House is not well known, but the Coote family who built it are. The first was Sir Charles Coote who died in battle at Trim in 1642, leaving his four estates to his four sons. His youngest son Colonel Thomas Coote was granted the lands in County Cavan after the Act of Settlement in 1662 and was the founder of the town of Cootehill. Live irish traditional music, country music, rock music and classical music, is an important part of the local culture. The Ulster Fleadh Cheoil has been hosted in Cootehill several times. Industry and tourism Cootehill's Masonic Hall In 1837, Cootehill became the site of one of the first eight branches of Ulster Bank which remains to this day. The town is also home to Abbott Laboratories, which manufactures infant formulae. Other factories include Eakins and Whelans Shoes, and the Cootehill Enterprise Centre is home to Carleton Bakery. Agriculture and related industry (such as chicken processing and mushroom cultivation), as well as retail, are the main employers. The surrounding lakes and rivers provide a backdrop which attracts visitors and sports enthusiasts. In the 18th and 19th century Cootehill was a centre for horse-racing.Jackson and Jane: Article by P. B. O Mordha in Clogher Historical Society. Traditional song sung by Paul Brady, \\"The Liberty Tapes,\\" 2001 There is a megalithic tomb in the townland of Cohaw approximately 5 km from Cootehill along the Shercock road. Bellamont House is a noted example of Palladian Architecture in Ireland, and remains in a well-preserved condition. The country house was the ancestral seat of the Coote family, Earls of Bellamont. The former Bellamont Estate was a sprawling country estate stretching from the town centre north towards Rockcorry to the right of the Dromore River. The forest was once thickly planted with Norway spruce and other trees, and is now managed by Coillte and was clearcut in the early 1990s. The estate featured several lakes, gatehouses at the numerous gates, pasture, forest, drumlins, and wildlife which includes wild deer and corncrakes. It is bordered by the Dromore River and Dartrey Forest (once part of the former, Dartrey Estate). Most of Bellamont Forest is now designated as Natural Heritage Area by Ireland's National Parks and Wildlife Service. Infrastructure At the end of 2006, Bindoo wind farm was completed close to Cootehill supplying the area with 48MW of wind generated electricity. In 2008, a further two wind farms were constructed namely the 31.5MW wind farm of Mountain Lodge co-owned by Galetech Energy Ltd and Hibernian Wind Ltd and the 3MW two turbine wind project of Edrans wholly owned by Galetech Energy Ltd. In 2017, a 20.5MW wind farm started construction known as Carrickallen wind farm owned by local company Galetech Energy Developments Ltd. Transport Cootehill railway station opened on 18 October 1860,Jonathan A. Smyth, 'The Establishment of Cootehill branch railway', Breifne, vol. x, no. 43. (2007) closed for goods and passenger traffic on 10 March 1947, finally closing altogether on 20 June 1955. The line closed under the auspices of the Great Northern Railway after it was nationalised by the two governments. Traditionally served by Bus √âireann. The service now comprises six journeys each way to/from Cavan and four journeys each way to/from Monaghan Mondays to Fridays inclusive. On Saturdays and Sundays there are two journeys in each direction. There is also a three days a week Route 166 linking the town to Carrickmacross and Dundalk: A company called Sillan operates a through coach service between the town and Dublin. Education The town has two national schools: the Darley and St. Michael's. St Michael's is the larger of the two, with over 200 students from the ages of 4 to 12. The local secondary school is St. Aidan's Comprehensive School. The Holy Family School, Monaghan Road, caters to students with special needs. Tanagh Outdoor Education Centre provides adventure sport activities (including canoeing and orienteering) for school groups and others.

It is used by mouth or by injection into a vein. Common side effects include nausea and bone marrow suppression. Other severe side effects may include anaphylaxis and the development of other cancers. Use during pregnancy may result in harm to the baby. Melphalan belongs to the class of nitrogen mustard alkylating agents. It works by interfering with the creation of DNA and RNA. Melphalan was approved for medical use in the United States in 1964. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication.  Medical uses  It is used to treat multiple myeloma, ovarian cancer, AL amyloidosis, and occasionally malignant melanoma. The agent was first investigated as a possible drug for use in melanoma, it was not found to be effective. In 2016, it was approved in the U.S. for: * use as a high-dose conditioning treatment prior to hematopoietic progenitor (stem) cell transplantation in multiple myeloma (MM) patients * the palliative treatment of MM patients for whom oral therapy is not appropriate Melphalan is currently being used to treat ocular retinoblastoma, a pediatric solid tumor. This is accomplished via transarterial catheter based slow pulsed infusion into the ophthalmic artery.  Side effects  Common side effects include: * Nausea * Bone marrow suppression, including ** Decreased white blood cell count causing increased risk of infection ** Decreased platelet count causing increased risk of bleeding Less common side effects include: * Severe allergic reactions * Pulmonary fibrosis (scarring of lung tissue) including fatal outcomes (usually only with prolonged use) * Hair loss * Interstitial pneumonitis * Rash * Itching * Irreversible bone marrow failure due to melphalan not being withdrawn early enough * Cardiac arrest  Mechanism of action  Melphalan chemically alters the DNA nucleotide guanine through alkylation, and causes linkages between strands of DNA. This chemical alteration inhibits DNA synthesis and RNA synthesis, functions necessary for cells to survive. These changes cause cytotoxicity in both dividing and non- dividing tumor cells.  Synthesis  Another amino acid-like drug is the antineoplastic agent melphalan. Tumor cells spend less time in resting phases than normal cells so at any given time, they are more likely to be metabolically active than most normal host cells. The rationale behind incorporating an alkylating function in a molecule resembling a primary cellular metabolite was to get a greater safety margin by fooling tumor cells into taking up the toxin preferentially.

The armada included one probe from the European Space Agency, two probes that were joint projects between the Soviet Union and France and two probes from the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science in Japan.  Main space probes  Vega probe model Probes involved (in order of closest approach): *Giotto (596 km), the first space probe to get close-up color images of the nucleus of a comet. (ESA) *Vega 2 (8,030 km), which dropped a balloon probe and lander on Venus before going on to Halley. (USSR/France Intercosmos) *Vega 1 (8,889 km), which dropped a balloon probe and lander on Venus before going on to Halley. (USSR/France Intercosmos) *Suisei (151,000 km), also known as PLANET-A. Data from Sakigake was used to improve upon Suisei for its dedicated mission to study Halley. (ISAS) *Sakigake (6.99 million km), Japan's first probe to leave the Earth system, mainly a test of interplanetary mission technology. (ISAS) Without the measurements from the other space probes, Giotto's closest distance would have been 4,000 km instead of the 596 km achieved.  Other missions  Other space probes had their instruments examining Halley's Comet: *Pioneer 7 was launched on August 17, 1966. It was put into heliocentric orbit with a mean distance of 1.1 AU to study the solar magnetic field, the solar wind, and cosmic rays at widely separated points in solar orbit. On 20 March 1986, the spacecraft flew within 12.3 million kilometers of Halley's Comet and monitored the interaction between the cometary hydrogen tail and the solar wind. *Pioneer Venus Orbiter in orbit of Venus, was positioned perfectly to take measurements of Halley's Comet during its perihelion February 9, 1986. Its UV-spectrometer observed the water loss when Halley's Comet was difficult to observe from the Earth. *International Cometary Explorer, which was repurposed as a cometary probe in 1982 and visited Comet Giacobini-Zinner in 1985, transited between the Sun and Halley's Comet in late March 1986 and took measurements. = Failed and cancelled missions = The Space Shuttle Challenger, on its launch on January 28th, 1986, was carrying SPARTAN-203 with the mission to make observations of Halley's Comet. STS-51L failed to reach orbit, resulting in the total loss of crew and vehicle. That launch failure resulted in the cancellation of dozens of subsequent shuttle missions, including the very next scheduled launch, STS-61-E, which had been slated for a March 6, 1986 launch, with its payload including the ASTRO-1 observatory, which was intended to make astronomical observations of Halley's Comet.

It is a white solid, although commercial samples appear yellow or brownish. Applications Although it can be applied on its own, Captan is often added as a component of other pesticide mixtures. It is used to control diseases on a number of fruits and vegetables as well as ornamental plants. It also improves the outward appearance of many fruits, making them brighter and healthier-looking. Captan is utilized by both home and agricultural growers and is often applied during apple production. It is also active against certain oomycetes, such as Pythium, making it useful for controlling damping off.Review of Fungicides for Control of Phytophthora and Pythium Diseases on Potted Ornamentals Biodegradation The compound biodegrades with halflife of less than 1 day in soil. Potential health effects Captan was previously cited as Group B2, a probable human carcinogen by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),EPA Captan Reregistration Eligibility Decision Facts but was reclassified in 2004. Since the mode of action has been established as a proliferative response (in mice only) after intestinal villi are disrupted, captan has been deemed not likely to cause tumors at doses that do not irritate the intestine. The EPA now states, \\"The new cancer classification considers captan to be a potential carcinogen at prolonged high doses that cause cytotoxicity and regenerative cell hyperplasia. These high doses of captan are many orders of magnitude above those likely to be consumed in the diet, or encountered by individuals in occupational or residential settings. Therefore, captan is not likely to be a human carcinogen nor pose cancer risks of concern when used in accordance with approved product labels.US EPA. 2004.

He stands 6'9\\" (2.06 m) tall. Born in Morgantown, West Virginia, Henderson attended Brebeuf Jesuit Preparatory School in Indianapolis, Indiana. They lost the state championship game his senior year to Glenn Robinson's Gary Roosevelt squad. In 1994, he was a part of the US men's basketball team for the Goodwill Games. College career While at Indiana University, Henderson led the team in rebounding all four years. Currently, he is the only Indiana University player to rank in the school's top five in scoring, rebounding, blocked shots and steals, and appeared in the Final Four in 1992. His 23.5 points per game scoring average for the 1995 season is the highest single season scoring average for any Indiana player during Bob Knight's 29-year tenure. Henderson was accepted into medical school at Indiana University and Howard University School of Medicine in 1995. He is also a member of Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity, and graduated from college with a degree in biology. NBA career In 1995, Henderson was selected with the 16th pick in the NBA draft by the Atlanta Hawks, and has since played for the Hawks, the Dallas Mavericks, Cleveland Cavaliers, and the Philadelphia 76ers. In his rookie year (1995‚Äì96) with the Hawks, he ranked 2nd on the team in total blocked shots (43). During the 1997-98 season, he was the recipient of the NBA Most Improved Player Award after averaging 14.3 points and 6.4 rebounds. He remained a member of an Atlanta team that for nine of his tenured seasons did not improve significantly nor get very far in the postseason when they qualified for the Playoffs. On August 4, 2004, along with Jason Terry, Henderson was traded to the Dallas Mavericks for Antoine Walker and Tony Delk. He was then traded to the Milwaukee Bucks along with Calvin Booth for Keith Van Horn on February 24, 2005. The Bucks then waived Henderson the following day. On March 1, he re- signed with the Mavericks. On September 17, 2005, Henderson signed with the Cleveland Cavaliers, appearing in 51 games as a reserve power forward.

She was named for Frank Bruce. History Bruce was launched 20 May 1920 by Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation, San Francisco, California, sponsored by Mrs. Annie Bruce, widow of Lieutenant Bruce, and commissioned 29 September 1920, Lieutenant Commander G. N. Reeves, Jr., in command. Bruce and in the Pedro Miguel Locks, ca. 1922. Bruce operated out of San Diego, California during her first year of service on engineering, gunnery, and torpedo exercises, and maneuvered with Squadron 5, Pacific Fleet. In November 1921 her home port was changed to Boston, Massachusetts and she reported to Division 27, Scouting Fleet. Her schedule of employment during succeeding years was the established routine of practice and fleet maneuvers. In December 1924 her commanding officer also assumed command of Destroyer Division 27. Her home yard was changed from Boston to Norfolk Navy Yard in June 1925. On 17 June, with her division, she sailed for duty with United States Naval Forces Europe. During the next year, naval forces operating in European waters cooperated with the State Department as a stabilizing influence in troubled regions and as security for American citizens living in these areas. Upon her return to Norfolk Navy Yard she operated along the eastern seaboard and in Cuban and Haiti waters until March 1927. In March she participated in the Fleet Tactical Problem held at Col√≥n, Panama, followed by the Fleet concentration along the Atlantic coast. During that summer she made training cruises with Naval Reservists along the northeastern seaboard. During 1928 and 1929 she continued to participate in fleet maneuvers and exercises along the east coast. On June 11, 1928, three civilian employees of the Norfolk Navy Yard were scalded to death while working in the number boiler room.[2] Fate In September 1929 Bruce put in at Philadelphia Navy Yard, where on 1 May 1930, she was decommissioned. She was later towed to Norfolk Navy Yard where she was used for experimental strength tests, before scrapping. Her salvage metal was sold in August 1932. As of 2005, no other ship in the United States Navy has been named Bruce. References *2.

Focal adhesions are visible as red dots at the end of the green bundles. In cell biology, focal adhesions (also cell‚Äìmatrix adhesions or FAs) are large macromolecular assemblies through which mechanical force and regulatory signals are transmitted between the extracellular matrix (ECM) and an interacting cell. More precisely, focal adhesions are the sub- cellular structures that mediate the regulatory effects (i.e., signaling events) of a cell in response to ECM adhesion. Focal adhesions serve as the mechanical linkages to the ECM, and as a biochemical signaling hub to concentrate and direct numerous signaling proteins at sites of integrin binding and clustering. Structure and function Focal adhesions are integrin-containing, multi-protein structures that form mechanical links between intracellular actin bundles and the extracellular substrate in many cell types. Focal adhesions are large, dynamic protein complexes through which the cytoskeleton of a cell connects to the ECM. They are limited to clearly defined ranges of the cell, at which the plasma membrane closes to within 15 nm of the ECM substrate. Focal adhesions are in a state of constant flux: proteins associate and disassociate with it continually as signals are transmitted to other parts of the cell, relating to anything from cell motility to cell cycle. Focal adhesions can contain over 100 different proteins, which suggests a considerable functional diversity. More than anchoring the cell, they function as signal carriers (sensors), which inform the cell about the condition of the ECM and thus affect their behavior. In sessile cells, focal adhesions are quite stable under normal conditions, while in moving cells their stability is diminished: this is because in motile cells, focal adhesions are being constantly assembled and disassembled as the cell establishes new contacts at the leading edge, and breaks old contacts at the trailing edge of the cell. One example of their important role is in the immune system, in which white blood cells migrate along the connective endothelium following cellular signals to damaged biological tissue. Morphology Connection between focal adhesions and proteins of the extracellular matrix generally involves integrins. Integrins bind to extra- cellular proteins via short amino acid sequences, such as the RGD motif (found in proteins such as fibronectin, laminin, or vitronectin), or the DGEA and GFOGER motifs found in collagen. Integrins are heterodimers which are formed from one beta and one alpha subunit. These subunits are present in different forms, their corresponding ligands classify these receptors into four groups: RGD receptors, laminin receptors, leukocyte-specific receptors and collagen receptors. Within the cell, the intracellular domain of integrin binds to the cytoskeleton via adapter proteins such as talin, Œ±-actinin, filamin, vinculin and tensin. Many other intracellular signalling proteins, such as focal adhesion kinase, bind to and associate with this integrin-adapter protein‚Äìcytoskeleton complex, and this forms the basis of a focal adhesion. Adhesion dynamics with migrating cells The dynamic assembly and disassembly of focal adhesions plays a central role in cell migration. During cell migration, both the composition and the morphology of the focal adhesion change. Initially, small (0.25Œºm¬≤) focal adhesions called focal complexes (FXs) are formed at the leading edge of the cell in lamellipodia: they consist of integrin, and some of the adapter proteins, such as talin, paxillin and tensin. Many of these focal complexes fail to mature and are disassembled as the lamellipodia withdraw. However, some focal complexes mature into larger and stable focal adhesions, and recruit many more proteins such as zyxin. Recruitment of components to the focal adhesion occurs in an ordered, sequential manner. Once in place, a focal adhesion remains stationary with respect to the extracellular matrix, and the cell uses this as an anchor on which it can push or pull itself over the ECM. As the cell progresses along its chosen path, a given focal adhesion moves closer and closer to the trailing edge of the cell. At the trailing edge of the cell the focal adhesion must be dissolved. The mechanism of this is poorly understood and is probably instigated by a variety of different methods depending on the circumstances of the cell. One possibility is that the calcium-dependent protease calpain is involved: it has been shown that the inhibition of calpain leads to the inhibition of focal adhesion-ECM separation. Focal adhesion components are amongst the known calpain substrates, and it is possible that calpain degrades these components to aid in focal adhesion disassembly =Actin retrograde flow= The assembly of nascent focal adhesions is highly dependent on the process of retrograde actin flow. This is the phenomenon in a migrating cell where actin filaments polymerize at the leading edge and flow back towards the cell body. This is the source of traction required for migration; the focal adhesion acts as a molecular clutch when it tethers to the ECM and impedes the retrograde movement of actin, thus generating the pulling (traction) force at the site of the adhesion that is necessary for the cell to move forward. This traction can be visualized with traction force microscopy. A common metaphor to explain actin retrograde flow is a large number of people being washed downriver, and as they do so, some of them hang on to rocks and branches along the bank to stop their downriver motion. Thus, a pulling force is generated onto the rock or branch that they are hanging on to. These forces are necessary for the successful assembly, growth, and maturation of focal adhesions. =Natural biomechanical sensor= Extracellular mechanical forces, which are exerted through focal adhesions, can activate Src kinase and stimulate the growth of the adhesions. This indicates that focal adhesions may function as mechanical sensors, and suggests that force generated from myosin fibers could contribute to maturing the focal complexes. This gains further support from the fact that inhibition of myosin-generated forces leads to slow disassembly of focal adhesions, by changing the turnover kinetics of the focal adhesion proteins. The relationship between forces on focal adhesions and their compositional maturation, however, remains unclear. For instance, preventing focal adhesion maturation by inhibiting myosin activity or stress fiber assembly does not prevent forces sustained by focal adhesions, nor does it prevent cells from migrating. Thus force propagation through focal adhesions may not be sensed directly by cells at all time and force scales. Their role in mechanosensing is important for durotaxis.

Medical Geology. The Commission on Geological Sciences for Environmental Planning defines medical geology as, \\"The science dealing with the influence of ordinary environmental factors on the geographical distribution of health problems in man and animals.\\" :In its broadest sense, medical geology studies exposure to or deficiency of trace elements and minerals; inhalation of ambient and anthropogenic mineral dusts and volcanic emissions; transportation, modification and concentration of organic compounds; and exposure to radionuclides, microbes and pathogens.Finkelman, R.B., Skinner, H. C. W., Plumlee G. S. & Bunnell, J. E. 2001. Medical Geology. Geotimes. http://www.agiweb.org/geotimes/nov01/feature_medgeo.html History Many have deemed medical geology as a new field when in actuality it is re-emerging. Hippocrates and Aristotle first recognized the relationship between human diseases and the earth's elements. Only now are people becoming aware of the effects the environment has on our health. This field ultimately depends on a number of different fields coming and working together to solve some of the earth's mysteries. The scientific term for this field is \\"hydrobiogeochemoepidemiopathoecology\\" however it is more commonly known as medical geology. It was established in 1990 by the International Union of Geological Sciences. Paracelsus, the father of pharmacology (1493‚Äì1541) stated that, \\"All substances are poisons, there is none which is not a poison. The right dosage differentiates a poison and a remedy.\\" This passage sums up the idea of medical geology perfectly. The goal of this field is to find the right balance and intake of elements/ minerals in order to improve and maintain health. Examples of research in medical geology include: * Studies on the impact of contaminant mobility as a result of extreme weather events such as flooding. *Lead and other heavy metal exposure resulting from dust and other particulates *Asbestos exposure such as amphibole asbestos dusts in Libby, Montana *Fungal infection resulting from airborne dust, such as Valley Fever or coccidioidomycosis Recently a new concept of geomedical engineering has been introduced in medical geology through a paper titled \\"Geomedical Engineering: A new and captivating prospect\\". It provides the fundamentals of engineering applications to the medical geology issues. Environment and human health It is widely known that the state of our environment affects us in many ways. Minerals and rocks are going to have some impact on human and animal populations because that is what the earth is composed of. Medical geology brings professionals from both the medicine field and the geology field to help us understand this relationship. There are two priorities that have been established within the medical geology field, \\"(1) the study of trace elements, especially their bioavailability and (2) a need to establish baseline, or background levels of contaminants/ xenobiotics/ potentially harmful but naturally occurring materials in water, soil, air, food, and animal tissue.\\" The elements and minerals in the land effect people and animals immensely especially when there is a close relationship between the two. Those who depend heavily on the land are faced with one of two problems. First, those who live in places such as Maputaland, South Africa are exposed to heavily impoverished soils which result in a number of diseases caused by mineral imbalances. Secondly, those in areas such as India and Bangladesh are often exposed to an excess of elements in the land resulting in mineral toxicity. All living organisms do of course need some naturally occurring elements however most can be extremely detrimental to health. There is a direct link between health and the earth because all humans ingest and breath in these chemicals and for the most part it is done unknowingly. =Sources of Chemicals= There are many ways in which humans come into contact with the earth's elements and below are only a few ways in which we become exposed to them. *Volcanoes are one of the main sources that bring all the toxicity from inside the earth to the outside. They bring out chemicals such as; arsenic, beryllium, cadmium, mercury, lead, radon, and uranium. *Rocks are also one of the leading sources in exposure to these elements. \\"They are essentially the source of all the naturally occurring chemical elements found on the earth.\\" Diseases =Iodine Deficiency= One of the biggest geochemical diseases is iodine deficiency. Thirty percent of the world is at risk for it and insufficient intake is the most common cause of mental retardation and brain damage. The sea is a major source of iodine and those who are further from it are at a disadvantage. Another source of it is in soil, however goitrogens such as humus and clay trap the iodine making it hard for people to access it. Some cultures actually consume the earth's minerals by eating soil and clay; this is known as geophagy. It is most common in the tropics, especially among pregnant women. The Ottomac people of South America engage in this practice and none have suffered from any health problems related with mineral/ Iodine deficiency. =Cardiovascular Disease= Cardiovascular disease has often been linked to water hardness as the main cause. Water hardness means that there is magnesium in the water with calcium playing a role. Some research has completely discredited this evidence, and has found that the more magnesium in the water the less chance of death cardiovascular disease. =Radiation= Natural radiation is found everywhere; it is in the air, water, soil, rocks, minerals and food. The largest amount of radiation comes from radon. Certain places are called 'high background radiation areas' (HBRAs), such as Guarapari, Southwest of France, Ramsar, parts of China, and Kerala Coast. People living in these areas however have not shown any health deficiencies and in some cases are even healthier and live longer than those not in HBRAs. =Other Issues= Among the problems presented there are also issues with fluoride in Africa and India, arsenic in Argentina, Chile, and Taiwan, selenium in areas of the United States, Venezuela, China and nitrate in agricultural areas. As medical geology grows it may become more important to the medical field in the issue of diseases. In addition to deficiencies of particular minerals, dietary excesses of certain elements occurring in specific geographic regions can also be harmful to human health, as per the examples listed below: *Hyperkalemia: excess amount of potassium *Hypercalcemia: excess amount of calcium *Hyperphosphatemia: excess amount of phosphorus International Medical Geology Association (IMGA) \\"The International Medical Geology Association aims to provide a network and a forum to bring together the combined expertise of geologists and earth scientists, environmental scientists, toxicologists, epidemiologists, and medical specialists, in order to characterize the properties of geological processes and agents, the dispersal of geological material and their effects on human population.\\" IMGA was founded in 2006 and manages affairs and funds, plans conferences, elections and publications, and they are also a way of encouraging growth and recognition in the field. Although it was founded in 2006, it was a work in progress for ten years when a working group of medical geology was established by the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS) in 1996. The goal of the working group was to advertise and make people aware of the harmful effects the environment has on our health.

Their size ranges from approximately 0.5 ¬µm to 2.0 ¬µm in diameter. While usually situated on the periphery of the cellular membrane, these unique structures display a polarized pattern of distribution in migrating cells, situating at the front border between the lamellipodium and lamellum. Their primary purpose is connected to cellular motility and invasion; therefore, they serve as both sites of attachment and degradation along the extracellular matrix. Many different specialized cells exhibit these dynamic structures such as invasive cancer cells, osteoclasts, vascular smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells, and certain immune cells like macrophages and dendritic cells.  Characteristics  A podosome consists of a core rich in actin surrounded by adhesion and scaffolding proteins. The actin filaments within these structures are highly regulated by many actin nucleators, polymerization activators, actin binding and crosslinking proteins, kinases, small GTPases, and scaffold proteins; therefore, total actin turnover occurs within seconds. To distinguish podosomes from others types of cellular adhesions, the protein Tks5 and WASP (Wiskott‚ÄìAldrich syndrome protein) are used as markers alongside actin, cortactin and the Arp2/3 complex to localize and isolate these protrusions because Tks5 and WASP are unique to the podosome when compared with other actin-based cellular structures. In their outward structure, the podosomes demonstrate two distinct features: an actin core and a ring complex. Within the core, coordinators of actin nucleation are found. Specifically, the Arp2/3 complex and WASP when close to the plasma membrane or cortactin when further away comprise this group of proteins. Emanating radially from the dense core of actin are actin filaments reaching to the plasma membrane and between neighboring podosomes. In the ring complex, integrins and integrin-associated proteins serve to connect the cytoskeleton to cell surface integrins forming the outward protrusion. Initial research suggested that the superstructure of podosomes were cylindrical, but new advances in bioimaging techniques have altered that perception and show the ring complex to display a polygonal form. These finding were made possible through the application of Bayesian blinking and bleaching analytics to data gained from standard widefield microscopy using cells that expressed fluorescently tagged proteins specific to the podosome ring complex. Typically, the podosome size falls between 0.5 um and 2.0 um in diameter and depth. The lifetime of the structure is only minutes in duration, much shorter than observed in invadopodia.  Function  Podosomes are thought to be intimately connected to cellular motility within tissue microenvironments through coordinating degradation of the extracellular matrix with cellular movement. The migration of cells is essential to proper embryonic development and, in maturity, to wound healing and the inflammatory response. Examples of these motile cell behaviors include: transendothelial migration of dendritic cells, migration of aortic endothelial cells for arterial vessel remodeling, and tissue infiltration by macrophages. Aberrations in cell migration lie beneath pathologies involving development, vasculature, and immunity. Consequently, podosomes are present in cell types associated with tissue remodeling and the immune system. Patients who suffer from Wiskott‚ÄìAldrich syndrome demonstrate, through their immune cells, continued evidence of the role podosomes fulfill in cell motility. These patients do not possess fully formed WASP that has been shown to localize in podosomes and to be integral to their formation from previous studies. The dendritic cells and macrophages of these patients‚Äô immune systems do not manifest podosome formations and demonstrate defects in cellular movement within tissue microenvironments. Some researchers suspect that podosomes may be implicated in the migration of neural crest cells. Patients who exhibit Frank‚Äìter Haar syndrome are known to be mutant for the podosome specific protein Tks4 and demonstrate defects in neural crest cell migration. Adding to the known functionalities of podosomes, research suggests that these dynamic structures also exhibit mechanosensory attributes. Initial formation of podosomes seems to be influenced by the structure and composition of the underlying substratum including the presence and distribution of specific ligands. Various integrin receptors monitor the mechanical properties of the cellular microenvironment and can influence and initiate formation of a podosome. Once fully formed, the integrity of the matrix substratum dictates the lifespan of the podosome with increased stiffness leading to longer endurance and closer spacing between podosome sites. Some studies indicates also a putative role for podosomes even in the regulation of bone marrow stem cell's function. Podosomes have been shown to be widely present in vitro on mesodermal progenitor cells (MPCs), cell capable of differentiating into mesenchymal stromal cells. It has been proposed that podosomes are important in the mobilisation of MPCs in the event of physiological need. = Role in osteoclasts = Osteoclasts are large, multinucleated bone cells that conduct the process of bone resorption. In this remodeling process, podosomes play an integral role. During the maturation of osteoclast precursors, groups of podosomes form higher ordered ring structures which ultimately coalesce into a band about the cell periphery. The resulting arrangement of podosomes is highly interconnected through a dense, radial network of actin filaments that extend between and onto neighboring podosomes. Accumulation of F-actin, vinculin, paxillin, and Œ±-actin within the podosomes of the coalescent band signals the development of a fully matured osteoclast. Upon initiation of bone resorption, the band of podosomes disassembles leaving behind a mesh primarily composed of F-actin which functions as the ‚Äòsealing zone.‚Äô This sealing zone becomes the site of osteoclast attachment to the bone matrix. Inhibition of bone resorption through drug intervention results in the lack of the podosome band during early osteoclast differentiation and ultimate absence of a sealing zone.  History  In the early 1980s, chicken embryo fibroblasts were transformed using the Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) containing the oncogene v-src. This transformation elicited the relocalization of vinculin and Œ±-actin in the cytoskeleton from focal adhesions forming circular clusters. Later in 1985, it was shown using the same cells that these protein clusters were localized to protrusions in the ventral plasma membrane, were substratum adhesion sites; therefore, these structures were termed podosomes indicating their foot-like character in cells. In 1989, it was demonstrated that these podosomes played a role in matrix degradation. To reflect this newly discovered destructive nature the name invadopodia was given to these dynamic structures. Because both terms invadopodia and podosomes were initially used to reference the identical structures in identical cell lines, there exists confusion about the nomenclature. Typically, when these structures are found in normal cells, they are referred to as podosomes, and when in cancer cells, invadopodia.

Most attacks centered on military targets near Saigon and Da Nang and were quickly beaten off. Some speculate that the attacks were mounted to test the will of the new U.S. President Richard Nixon who retaliated by secretly bombing PAVN/VC sanctuaries in Cambodia the following month. Numerous bases were attacked, these attacks were all beaten back but did inflict casualties and reinforced the fact that PAVN/VC forces were able to mount attacks at will. Long Binh/Bien Hoa Intelligence had indicators of the pending attacks. On 19 February, a defector surrendered to Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) forces and revealed a large VC force would attack key installations in the Saigon area to include Long Binh Post. Unfortunately, the reporting was delayed and did not reach Long Binh until the morning of 22 February 1969, the day the defector warned the attacks were set to begin. Men of the 1st Squadron 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment, halt their M-113s in a Vietnamese cemetery near Long Binh, 23 February 1969 After sundown on the 22nd, elements of the VC 274th Regiment, 5th Division made their final preparations while occupying three hills along Highway 15 approximately three kilometers south of the base. That evening, several ambush squads from the 720th Military Police Battalion, 18th MP Brigade kept watch along potential avenues of approach to Long Binh Post. One of the MP ambush squads held a position within a kilometer of the VC stronghold. At 02:00 on 23 February, the 274th VC Regiment initiated their attack with an estimated 78 rounds of rocket and mortar fire from their positions. The rounds landed on post with some igniting the POL fuel site east of the highway. The VC made several attempts to advance on the base, but were halted. Full-scale sweeping operations to secure the perimeter began just after noon that day. M113 armored personnel carriers and M551 Sheridan armored reconnaissance vehicles supported the forces on the ground while AH-1 Cobra gunships and OH-6 helicopters provided air support. These units made occasional contact, often with PAVN or VC who fought stubbornly from trenches and spider holes. In the early morning hours of 26 February, a force of approximately 400 men from the VC 275th Regiment, 5th Division, had infiltrated into the tiny village of Thai Hiep on the outskirts of Bien Hoa. About 85 per cent of the force was estimated to be PAVN soldiers. At about 03:00, as reconnaissance elements of the unit were observed and engaged by US Air Force security forces at the perimeter of Bien Hoa Air Base, the villagers began to flee their homes, running down streets and creek beds. The villagers met elements of the South Vietnamese 5th Marine Battalion, the 3rd Battalion, 48th Infantry Regiment, 18th Division and the 3rd Squadron, 5th Armored Cavalry moving on the road less than a half mile from Thai Hiep in response to the contact at the air base. The villagers told the ARVN forces how they were driven out of their homes and confined to an area near a creek running alongside the village. At that time, the air base security forces reported that they had lost contact with the enemy reconnaissance element which withdrew east toward Thai Hiep. The ARVN units swiftly moved into blocking positions, and by daybreak, the PAVN/VC were surrounded. Additional South Vietnamese Regional Force elements moved in and the ARVN troops continued to contain the PAVN/VC forces until 11:00 when assault forces, in the form of the ARVN 36th Ranger Battalion, reinforced the contact. By 15:00 the 36th Ranger Battalion moved into the village attacking the PAVN/VC force. The series of assaults met heavy resistance by the battalion of PAVN who had turned the villagers sandbagged shelters into a series of well-fortified defensive positions. ARVN psychological operations units broadcast repeated loud-speaker appeals and warnings, and all of the remaining villagers and several wounded PAVN/VC evacuated out of Thai Riep. Just after 16:00 US Air Force F-100s and F-4s along with Republic of Vietnam Air Force A-1 Skyraiders were directed against the PAVN/VC positions in the village. Following the employment of the supporting fires, the 36th Ranger Battalion moved back into the village. The Rangers met only slight, disorganized resistance. By 01:00 the next morning, the bodies of 264 PAVN/VC soldiers lay in the village, and 87 had been captured or surrendered. More than 100 individual and crew-served weapons were captured. ARVN casualties were 10 killed and 100 wounded and one US Army photographer was killed. The prisoners revealed that their mission had been to attack Bien Hoa city and the Bien Hoa Air Base. Da Nang Marine Air Support Squadron 3 Marine carries a shredded Viet Cong flag after an attack west of Da Nang Since early February 1969, the 1st Marine Division had noted an upsurge in PAVN/VC activity around Da Nang. On 7 February Company D, 1st Battalion, 26th Marines found a PAVN/VC base area near the Nam O bridge northwest of the Red Beach Base Area, leaving the base untouched, they returned at night setting up a series of ambushes that killed 18 PAVN and captured 2. On 8 February patrols from 3rd Battalion, 7th Marines found 7 122mm rockets 14km southwest of Da Nang and another 13 140mm rockets 2km further south. On 18 February a Company F, 2nd Battalion, 1st Marines called in artillery fire on a group of PAVN/VC 5km south of Marble Mountain resulting in 21 secondary explosions believed to be from detonating rockets. Also in mid-February Company D, 1st Battalion, 7th Marines engaged an entrenched PAVN platoon 22km southwest of Da Nang killing 30 and the ARVN 2nd Battalion, 51st Regiment operating 4km west of the Marines killed 49 PAVN moving north of Go Noi Island. After midnight on 23 February Company K, 3rd Battalion, 1st Marines and Company D, 1st Military Police Battalion detected VC approaching the Song Cau Do river bridges and attacked them killing 47 and capturing 11. A 70-strong VC force attacked the 2/1 Marines command post 6km south of Marble Mountain losing 17 dead. To the west of Da Nang, shortly after midnight on the 23rd Company M, 3/7 Marines ambushed a PAVN force killing 10 and later that night a larger force was spotted and artillery fire was called in. On searching the site at dawn it was found that 2 PAVN 81mm mortar teams had been destroyed in the barrage. Before dawn on 23 February, the first day of T·∫øt, the PAVN/VC fired 25 122mm rockets at Da Nang's deep water port hitting an ARVN ammunition dump and a fuel tank farm at Da Nang Air Base and cause minor damage to an A-6A and 6 helicopters at the Air Base. Later that day rockets hit the An Hoa Combat Base destroying 15,000 rounds of artillery ammunition and igniting 40,000 gallons of aviation fuel and 50 rockets were fired at Naval Support Activity Da Nang with more than half going into the sea and the remainder causing minor damage. At dawn PAVN sappers attacked the 1st Marine Division headquarters on Hill 327 and the 2/7 Marines command post to the northwest. These attacks were repulsed for Marines losses of 18 killed and more than 75 PAVN killed. After dawn on 23 February a VC unit was detected near the H√≤a Vang District and the Marine security force killed 6 and captured 2 and forced the rest of the unit to retreat into a cemetery where they were attacked by the ARVN 21st Ranger Battalion the next day losing a further 57 killed. Meanwhile to the west 3/7 Marines continued to engage PAVN forces, forcing them into 3 pockets along the Song Tuy Loan river. Two of the pockets were destroyed by the next morning resulting in the capture of the acting commander of the 141st Regiment. The last pocket along the An Tan ridgeline proved more difficult and Company L, 3/7 Marines suffered numerous casualties forcing it to withdraw. On the morning of 26 February following Napalm and Snake Eye air strikes, Company L, reinforced by Company M assaulted the PAVN position making slow progress against determined PAVN resistance. The attack continued into 27 February when the Marines overran the PAVN resulting in a total of more than 200 killed. PAVN/VC retreating to the south from Da Nang were intercepted by elements of the 1st Marine Regiment and ARVN 1st Battalion, 51st Regiment 11km south of Da Nang losing 139 dead in 3 days of fighting. The PAVN/VC attacks on Da Nang were a failure resulting in more than 500 dead.

In a variation named tsuji-nage (ËæªÊäï„Åí, \\"crossroads throwing\\"), the samurai would attack the passerby with jujutsu in order to test his own techniques or indulge in alive practice.Rajender Singh, Fundamentals of Judo This must not be mistaken with tsuji-zumo, unsanctioned sumo bouts hosted in the street between willing participants. History In the medieval era, the term referred to traditional duels between samurai, but in the Sengoku period (1467‚Äì1600), widespread lawlessness caused it to degrade into indiscriminate murder, permitted by the unchecked power of the samurai. Shortly after order was restored, the Edo government prohibited the practice in 1602. Offenders would receive capital punishment. 1696 spree killing The only known incident where a very large number of people were indiscriminately killed in the Edo period was the 1696 Yoshiwara spree killing (, Yoshiwara hyakunin giri; \\"One hundred Yoshiwara slash\\"), where a wealthy lord, Sano Jir≈çzaemon, had a psychotic fit and murdered dozens of prostitutes with a katana in Yoshiwara, the red-light district of Edo (modern-day Tokyo). Over 100 were killed in the attacks and the following process of apprehension. Despite his class and heritage, he was treated by authorities as a spree killer and was later sentenced to death and executed.Roadside Samurai: The Brutal act of Tsujigiri Later, a kabuki play was made about the incident; the incident later inspired the 1960 movie adaptation Hero of the Red-Light District.Mitamura, Engyo.

He was described as \\"an ideal centre forward\\". He scored three goals in his debut aged 16 for Nottingham Forest. He was an amateur who did not wear football boots but scored 14 goals for England in 13 internationals Lindley was given an O.B.E. in January 1918 for his work during World War One and in 1935 he was also awarded the King George V Silver Jubilee Medal.Notts County match programme 8 March 2014 pg. 63 On retirement from football, Lindley turned his attention to his law practice, having been called to the Bar in 1899 while still playing. Career Lindley was the third son of Leonard Lindley who was a lace dresser and Mayor of Nottingham in 1882. The family lived in Clipstone Avenue, Nottingham and Lindley attended Nottingham High School between 1875 and 1883, where he first revealed his talent. His older brother, Leonard, was also a talented footballer and cricketer. He later attended The Leys School in Cambridge, where he turned to rugby. From 1885 to 1888 he studied at Caius College, Cambridge and during this time played football for Cambridge University, and also for the Corinthians and Casuals. Tinsley obtained not just a degree but he also achieved a Master of Law and LL.D law doctorate. In 1888, he returned to his home town to join Nottingham Forest. He was the youngest ever Nottingham Forest player and at age 16 he scored three goals on his debut on 17 February 1882. In one season, he scored 85 goals for Forest. During the 1889‚Äì90 season also played three matches for Nottingham rivals Notts County, Lindsley was drafted in as cover for James Oswald in a match against Aston Villa, Villa were unhappy as he was not registered, they appealed and Notts were fined ¬£5, Lindley appealed but the fine was increased to ¬£30 and Notts were deducted 2 points. In 1891 he also played for Crusaders and Swifts for a short while before guest-playing for Preston North End in a 4‚Äì1 defeat at Sunderland in 1892. His many transfers were due primarily to his professional full-time career and the fact that he always remained an amateur, although many clubs wanted to hire him as a professional. He was the epitome of the 'Corinthian gentleman amateur' of his time, being an academic as well as a sportsman. He refused to wear ordinary football boots when playing, preferring walking brogues instead, declaring that boots marred his great sprinting speed. International football His England call-up came on 13 March 1886 when, along with his Nottingham Forest teammate Teddy Leighton, he was one of eight new caps selected to play against Ireland at Ballynafeigh Park, Belfast. Lindley scored as England \\"totally dominated\\" the match with Benjamin Spilsbury scoring four goals in a 6‚Äì1 victory. It has been claimed that he holds the record for scoring in 9 consecutive England matches between 13 March 1886 and 7 April 1888. However, there is no substance whatsoever to this claim, as this includes the match against Wales on 29 March 1886, in which all contemporary reports credit the goals to George Brann, Fred Dewhurst and Andrew Amos. He did, however, score in each of the next 6 consecutive games, which is still an England record (though note that Steve Bloomer scored in 10 consecutive matches in which he played, and George Camsell in 9).England's Player Record Performances at www.englandfootballonline.com In total he scored 14 international goals in just 13 games. He held the overall England goalscoring record from March 1888 when he equalled Charles Bambridge's tally of 11 until his final tally of 14 was overhauled by Steve Bloomer in 1898. First-class cricket Lindley played first-class cricket for Cambridge University and Nottinghamshire. He played ten games between 1885 and 1893 taking nearly a wicket a match as a round-arm right-armed slow to medium bowler. Lindley also averaged about 10 runs per innings as a right-handed batsman. Retirement from playing On retirement from football, Lindley turned his full attention to his law practice, having been called to the Bar in 1899 while still playing. He also lectured in law at University of Nottingham and served as a County Court Judge on the Midland Circuit. Lindley also stayed loyal to Nottingham Forest, serving on the committee for several years. Lindley was also a President and Vice President for local Amateur side Nottinghamshire FC who were formed in 1895.Nottinghamshire FC Minute Books 1902 - 1908 During World War One, Lindley served as the Chief Officer of the Nottingham Special Constabulary and as Deputy Director of the Nottinghamshire Territorial Association.

Academies Franklin High School's curriculum is divided into 5 academies, the 9th Grade Academy and four Small Learning Communities) for the 10-12th Grade students: Academy of Finance (AOF), and John Stanford Public Service Academy (PSA), Humanities, and CREATE Academy. Each academy specializes in a particular study with their own mission statement and required classes.School Academies webpage, retrieved 2012-04-09 The Academy of Finance is an integrated social studies and language arts program supported by the nationally recognized and represented National Academy Foundation. Students study world history and literature from the point of view of trade and economic development. By combining accounting, social studies, and language arts, the Academy of Finance develops skills needed in the business environment. Mastery of technology, knowledge of available resources, and good communication are prioritized. The John Stanford Public Service and Political Science Academy (PSA), founded in 2000, is a college preparatory small learning community (SLC) that offers students a rigorous 3 year academic program that meets and exceeds state standards for Language Arts and Social Studies. State standards in LA and Social Studies are overlaid with an emphasis on the role of the public sector in societies, past and present. PSA students are challenged to develop their critical thinking skills and to develop their own vision of the role that they and their government should take in confronting the opportunities and problems of their local, national, and international communities. The PSA combines Public Service and Political Science (the study of law, government and NGOs, history, political systems, etc.). The Humanities is also a college preparatory academy. This academy is considered the best academy in Franklin High School's history. The classes consist of integrated Language Arts and Social Studies classes with special emphasis on project-based learning, the history of art and culture, and rigorous skills and content development. The Humanities program covers history through the lens of humanism starting in the Italian Renaissance and following through to modern times. The CREATE Academy focuses on three subject: math, language arts, and woodshop.

Tiles on the Jardim 1.¬∫ de Dezembro, Portim√£o, Portugal. The Treaty of Zamora (5 October 1143) recognized Portuguese independence from the Kingdom of Le√≥n. Based on the terms of the accord, King Alfonso VII of Le√≥n recognized the Kingdom of Portugal in the presence of his cousin King Afonso I of Portugal, witnessed by the papal representative, Cardinal Guido de Vico, at the Cathedral of Zamora. Both kings promised durable peace between their kingdoms. By this treaty Afonso I of Portugal also recognized the suzerainty of the Pope. This treaty came as of a result of the Battle of Valdevez.  Background  Victorious in the Battle of Ourique, in 1139, Afonso Henriques benefited from the developed action by the archbishop of Braga, D. Jo√£o Peculiar, in favor of the constitution of the new Kingdom of Portugal. To reconcile Afonso Henriques and his cousin Alfonso VII of Le√≥n, the archbishop made arrangements for them to meet in Zamora in 4 and 5 of October 1143 in the presence of the cardinal Guido de Vico.  Result  By the terms of the treaty, Alfonso VII agreed that the County of Portugal would become a kingdom, and that D. Afonso Henriques would be its king. The Portuguese sovereignty, recognized by Alfonso VII in Zamora,Waisberg, Tatiana, \\"The Treaty of Tordesillas and the (Re)Invention of International Law in the Age of Discovery\\" Journal of Global Studies, No 47, 2017, p. 4. was only confirmed by Pope Alexander III in 1179, but the title of rex, which D. Afonso Henriques used since 1140, was confirmed at Zamora, when the Portuguese monarch committed, before the cardinal, to consider himself a vassal of the Holy See, being then obliged, himself and his descendants, to pay an annual tithe to the Pope. From 1143, D. Afonso Henriques would send repentance letters to the Pope declaring himself his lord vassal and committing himself to sending a determined amount of gold every year. The negotiations would last several years, from 1143 to 1179. In 1179, Pope Alexander III would send D. Afonso Henriques the papal bull \\"Manifestis probatum\\", in which the Pope accepted that D. Afonso Henriques would pay him direct vassalage, acknowledging definitely the independence of the Kingdom of Portugal without vassalage to Alfonso VII (because a vassal couldn't have two direct lords) and D.

As an artist, he was known for his country motifs often featuring children. His most widely recognized work is Grindslanten (1885) featuring a typical scene from 19th century Sweden. Influenced by the national romanticism of Gothicismus, he also collected motives from Norse mythology. He made illustrations for publications of both Frithiofs saga (Fri√∞√æj√≥fs saga hins fr≈ìkna) and The Tales of Ensign St√•l (F√§nrik St√•ls s√§gner).Malmstr√∂m, Johan August (Svenskt biografiskt handlexikon, II:119 ) Malmstr√∂m served as a professor at the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts and later manager of the same institution. Malmstr√∂m was also an illustrator who worked for several newspapers and book publishing houses. Additionally, Malmstr√∂m designed furnitures, worked as a pattern drawer and was a designer for Gustavsberg porcelain.  Biography =Childhood and youth= Portrait of August Malmstr√∂m as a young artist, signed in Paris in 1859, by Wilhelmina Lagerholm (1826-1912). August Malmstr√∂m was born at Nubbekullen in V√§stra Ny parish within the municipality of Motala in √ñsterg√∂tland County, Sweden. Nubbekullen (Nubbekullens hembygdsg√•rd) is today the site of a local museum. His father, Anders Gustaf Malmstr√∂m, was a carpenter and ornamental sculptor who managed the small farm. August, together with his brother, helped his father with agriculture and woodwork. Among other works they made ornaments for altarpieces and pulpits to churches. Both parents encouraged August in his choice of life. His mother, Brita Stina H√•kansdotter, was interested in literature, which evoked his interest in history. He showed early interest in drawing and painting. An injury in his right hand which never cured properly exempted him from hard work and gave him even more time to spend on arts. In his teens he was skilled enough to support his family, he made small paintings and colored pictures which were given away as presents on birthdays and name days. His parents recognized his talent and sold their only ox to finance his studies in Stockholm. =Academy of Fine Arts in Stockholm= Grindslanten (1885) The Old and the Young Sweden (1894) Dancing Fairies (1866) Malmstr√∂m came to Stockholm and applied for admission at the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts. It was first with the help of the painter Nils Andersson (1817-1865) that he managed to be accepted and thus on 3 November 1849 he was registered at the academy's ground school. Already at the beginning his talent attracted attention and his study period was marked by rewards of all sorts. The academy had painting contests every year with given themes and Malmstr√∂m was probably the most diligent participant. For the 1855 contest, he was the only student to submit a contribution with Konung Gustaf II Adolfs lifsfara i tr√§ffningen vid Wittsj√∂ (\\"King Gustaf II Adolf in mortal danger at the battle of Wittsj√∂\\") . However, his work was \\"not in a good condition to be rewarded\\". A growing problem the academy faced was that more and more students left the academy for studies in D√ºsseldorf, a trend Malmstr√∂m followed in 1856. He considered the academy's education as insufficient and at the same time his economic situation became gradually better. Besides scholarships and picture sales, he earned incomes from portrait orders and restoration tasks.August Malmstr√∂m (Store norske leksikon, 2005 - 2007) =D√ºsseldorf 1856-1857= Malmstr√∂m is associated with the D√ºsseldorf school of painting. There exists no proofs that he took part in any education in the city. He presumably pursued studies on his own. During autumn 1856, he send home his first painting King Heimer and Asl√∂g from D√ºsseldorf and during spring 1857 he then send home King Aella's messenger before Ragnar Lodbrok's sons Both of these works impressed the Swedish Academy. During their exhibition, the painting King Heimer and Asl√∂g was rewarded with the Royal Medal. Thereby the Academy had the possibility to give Malmstr√∂m travel scholarships, which happened on 2 October. The grant and several painting sales meant that he was financially secured for many years forward.Biography of Johan August Malmstr√∂m (The Biography) =Paris 1857-1859= In 1857, Malmstr√∂m traveled together with M√•rten Eskil Winge (1825-1896) to Paris. Winge was a good friend of Malmstr√∂m and also had received a travel scholarship. Besides diligent studies at the museums, they were students of Thomas Couture (1815‚Äì1879 )who had a solid reputation as a skillful teacher who taught a number of Swedish students. In 1856, Couture became an honorable member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts. Malmstr√∂m returned 1858 to D√ºsseldorf to complete Vikingar p√• stranden (\\"Vikings at shore\\") together with the Norwegian painter Hans Fredrik Gude (1825-1903) but soon traveled back to Paris. Regulations for travel scholarships prescribed that a copy of a work by a great master should be made. The choice fell on Titian's painting Christ Crowned with Thorns, this because other works by Titian were already and constantly occupied by others, in some cases for many years.August Malmstr√∂m (Historiesajten.se) =Italy 1859-1860= According to the instructions for both holders of the travel scholarship. the Academy stated that after a year of residence in Paris they should take a travel to Italy. After two years in Paris, Winge and Malmstr√∂m went to Italy at the end of 1859. Much to his indignation, Malmstr√∂m got a rejection to his application to copy Rafael's works at the Vatican. Instead he made some copies of Rafael's and Titian's works in Palazzo Borghese. Malmstr√∂m returned to Paris in 1860. In the summer of 1863, Malmstr√∂m left Paris for a new visit to Italy to study. J August Malmstr√∂m (Svenskt biografiskt lexikon) =Return to Sweden= His artistic breakthrough came in January 1864 after his return to Sweden. In 1866, he exhibited five works at the General Industrial Exposition of Stockholm (1866) (Stockholmsutst√§llningen 1866). He was appointed an apprentice (agr√©) at the Royal Swedish Academy of Art in Stockholm. Subsequently, he was appointed professor of the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts in 1867 where he taught until 1894. He also served as manager of the same institution from 1887 to 1893. Upon his death in 1901, he was buried in the cemetery at Solna Church (Solna kyrkog√•rd) near Stockholm. He bequeathed some 650 watercolors, drawings and 26 sketchbooks to the Nordic Museum on Djurg√•rden.Scandinavia's 1st Exhibition of Industry and Art, Stockholm 1866 (Coin People.com) See also *D√ºsseldorf school of painting Gallery Image:Aslaug.JPGAslaug (1850) Image:Kung Heimer och Asl√∂g.jpgKung Heimer och Asl√∂g (1856) File:Konung Ellas s√§ndebud inf√∂r Ragnar Ladbroks s√∂ner (1857) av August Malmstr√∂m.jpgKing Aella's messenger before Ragnar Lodbrok's sons (1857) Image:Orvarodd.jpgOrvar-Odd relates of Hjalmar's death (1859) File:August Malmstr√∂m - Lekande barn i tr√§dg√•rdsland.jpgChildren playing in garden (1866) Image:Blenda uppmanar - August Malmstr√∂m 1860.jpgBlenda (1860) File:August Malmstr√∂m-v√§va vadmal.JPGTraditional Swedish dance (1882) File:August Malmstr√∂m.Sketch for √Ñlvaleken.jpg√Ñlvaleken, a study for the Dancing Fairies References Other sources *Bj√∂rk, Tomas (1997) August Malmstr√∂m - Grindslantens m√•lare och 1800-talets bildv√§rld (Nordiska Museets F√∂rlag) *Facos, Michelle (1998) Nationalism and the Nordic Imagination: Swedish Art of the 1890s (University of California Press) External links * Nubbekullens hembygdsg√•rd website Category:1829 births Category:1901 deaths Category:People from √ñsterg√∂tland County Category:People from Motala Municipality Category:19th-century Swedish painters Category:Swedish male painters Category:Symbolist painters Category:Swedish furniture designers Category:Members of the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts Category:Artists from Stockholm Category:Swedish illustrators Category:19th-century male artists ","title":"August Malmstr√∂m"},{"id":"2440837","text":"Jhr.

This is typically done to enable the player to obtain a higher salary and/or greater number of years on their contract than NBA salary cap rules ordinarily allow the destination team, itself, to provide the player. Benefits and function The sign-and-trade helps NBA teams capitalize on financial assets that they would otherwise lose‚Äîwith nothing gained in return‚Äîif a player became a free agent. It is a factor in the departing player's increased salary and extended contract. It helps the team gaining the player, by enabling it to offer a better/more economically competitive contract to the player, than otherwise would be allowed under league rules. Often, circumstances arise wherein a team‚Äîknowing that one of its players is planning on pursuing (unrestricted) free agency in the coming off-season‚Äîknows that another NBA team is sure to sign him. The unrestricted free agency status prevents the team from stopping or financially benefiting from a new deal the player may sign with any other team(s); so, the player could sign with another team, leaving the original team with neither money nor a replacement (i.e., a player traded from the acquiring team, to them) player, in exchange. However, because the original team starts out as the player's current contract holder, the team can offer the player more money per year than any other team, and, can sign the player to a longer-lasting contract‚Äîper the league's CBA. Therefore, it is in the player's economic best interests to get the richest/longest deal possible by re-signing with the current team, then be traded to the new team‚Äîwhich, under NBA rules, will be obligated to honor the newly signed contract's terms‚Äîrather than pursue outright free agency, alone. The player's original team will receive players, cash, and/or (future) draft picks in return for the departing player, depending on the terms of the trade. As of the 2017 CBA, sign and trade contracts of five years are forbidden, since the player would not be allowed to sign outright for five years with his new team. Nevertheless, the sign and trade allows players to sign with a new team who is already over the cap for more than the mid level exception amount of approximately $10 million, and in some cases can give the player's old team a trade exception subject to base year compensation rules. Restrictions Under terms of the current CBA, sign-and-trades come with many significant restrictions. Transactions under this rule require all of the following to be true: * The player must re-sign with his former team. * Additionally, the player must have been on the team's roster at the end of the immediately previous season. This provision, introduced with the 2011 CBA and maintained in the 2017 CBA, closed a loophole that allowed a team to sign-and-trade any player to whom it held \\"Bird rights\\", regardless of whether the player was active in the league. An example of such a transaction banned under the current CBA is the Dallas Mavericks' inclusion of Keith Van Horn in the trade for Jason Kidd in order to match salary. * While restricted free agents can be signed and traded, this is not allowed if that player has signed an offer sheet with another team. * The team receiving the player cannot have a payroll that exceeds the so-called \\"apron\\"‚Äîa designated level above the NBA luxury tax threshold‚Äîafter the trade. A team with a payroll above the apron can only receive a player in a sign-and-trade if the transaction drops that team's payroll below the apron. Once the transaction is complete, the team receiving the player is hard capped at the apron for the entire season. * The receiving team cannot have used the so-called \\"taxpayer mid-level exception\\" in that season. The taxpayer mid-level exception is a limited financial buffer that teams with total payroll above the luxury tax threshold must use to sign players for up to 3 years. * The regular season has not yet started. * The player must receive a contract of either 3 or 4 years (not including any option years), where only the first year must be fully guaranteed. (5-year sign-and-trade contracts were abolished in the 2017 CBA to disincentivize the transaction.) In turn, this means that he cannot be signed using a salary cap exception that does not allow the team to offer a 3-year contract. Rescission Sign-and-trades are considered to be \\"atomic transactions\\". Under NBA rules, if the acquiring team voids the trade, then the new contract signed with the initial team is voided as well. This prevents the initial team from being 'stuck' with a player they either do not want and/or cannot afford to keep under the terms of the signed contract. The player is also protected from being contractually obligated to a new team that they may no longer want to work for. Such an event happened in 2005, when small forward Shareef Abdur- Rahim was acquired by the New Jersey Nets in a sign-and-trade with the Portland Trail Blazers. The trade was subsequently canceled by the Nets, when a physical exam detected scar tissue (which increases the odds of future injury) in Abdur-Rahim's knee. As a result of the cancellation, Abdur-Rahim once again became a free agent; his new contract with the Trail Blazers (who had his \\"Bird rights\\") was voided, and he later signed with the Sacramento Kings.

The energy change associated with this transition provides information on the structure of a molecule and determines many molecular properties such as colour. The relationship between the energy involved in the electronic transition and the frequency of radiation is given by Planck's relation. Organic molecules and other molecules The electronic transitions in organic compounds and some other compounds can be determined by ultraviolet‚Äìvisible spectroscopy, provided that transitions in the ultraviolet (UV) or visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum exist for this compound. Electrons occupying a HOMO of a sigma bond can get excited to the LUMO of that bond. This process is denoted as a œÉ ‚Üí œÉ* transition. Likewise promotion of an electron from a œÄ-bonding orbital to an antibonding œÄ orbital* is denoted as a œÄ ‚Üí œÄ* transition. Auxochromes with free electron pairs denoted as n have their own transitions, as do aromatic pi bond transitions. Sections of molecules which can undergo such detectable electron transitions can be referred to as chromophores since such transitions absorb electromagnetic radiation (light), which may be hypothetically perceived as color somewhere in the electromagnetic spectrum. The following molecular electronic transitions exist: :œÉ -> œÉ* :œÄ -> œÄ* :n -> œÉ* :n -> œÄ* :aromatic œÄ -> aromatic œÄ* In addition to these assignments, electronic transitions also have so-called bands associated with them. The following bands are defined: the R-band from the German radikalartig or radical-like, the K-band from the German Konjugierte or conjugated, B-band from benzoic and the E-band from ethylenic (system devised by A. Burawoy in 1930). For example, the absorption spectrum for ethane shows a œÉ ‚Üí œÉ* transition at 135 nm and that of water a n ‚Üí œÉ* transition at 167 nm with an extinction coefficient of 7,000. Benzene has three aromatic œÄ ‚Üí œÄ* transitions; two E-bands at 180 and 200 nm and one B-band at 255 nm with extinction coefficients respectively 60,000, 8,000 and 215. These absorptions are not narrow bands but are generally broad because the electronic transitions are superimposed on the other molecular energy states. Solvent shifts The electronic transitions of molecules in solution can depend strongly on the type of solvent with additional bathochromic shifts or hypsochromic shifts. Line spectra Spectral lines are associated with atomic electronic transitions and polyatomic gases have their own absorption band system.

It was programmed by Greg Christensen and published by the Atari Program Exchange (APX) in 1981. Caverns of Mars became the best selling APX title of all-time and was moved into Atari, Inc.'s official product line, first on diskette and later on cartridge. The game is essentially a vertically-scrolling version of the Konami arcade game Scramble, with the twist that after reaching the end the player must re-trace their steps back to the top.  Gameplay  Opening scene in Caverns of Mars. The rockets are static. Caverns of Mars is a vertically-scrolling shooter similar in concept and visual style to the 1981 arcade game Scramble.Overview of Caverns of Mars at allgame.com Christensen changed the orientation of the caverns from Scramble, having the player fly down into them as opposed to sideways through them. Unlike Scramble, the targets generally do not move relative to the map. Using a joystick, the player controls a ship descending into the tunnels of Mars, firing at targets along the way. The player's spacecraft has two cannons, positioned on either side of the craft, firing downwards. The player needs to avoid hitting the cavern walls, while shooting targets of opportunity along the way. Fuel tanks can be shot to add 5 points of fuel, and the craft is destroyed if it runs out. There are several different sections of the map, with easier skill levels removing the more difficult sections from the areas through which the player has to fly. The easiest skill level has only three sections, the hardest has six. On any skill level the last section of the map is a reactor, which the player lands on and thereby sets to explode. The player then has to reverse course and fly up and out of the caverns to escape before the reactor explodes.  Development  Greg Christensen, a high-school senior, purchased an Atari 800 in 1981, and created Caverns in \\"little more than a month and a half\\"--the first significant program he wrote in 6502 assembly language. Fred Thorlin of Atari Program Exchange recalled Caverns arriving at APX: Two months after sending it to APX, Christensen received his first royalty check for $18,000, and a phone call from an Atari executive who praised the game. Caverns eventually won the 1981 APX game contest, winning another $3,000, and in December 1982, Atari told Christensen he might receive up to $100,000 in royalties.Dale Archibald, \\"Programming for Dollars\\", Video Games, December 1982 Atari licensed the game in early 1982 for distribution in the main Atari catalog, distributing it on diskette.\\"Caverns of Mars\\", The Atari Connection, Spring 1982, p. 11 This was the first APX to Atari move, among very few examples in total. When asked to collaborate on a cartridge- based port, Christensen declined, having started college.\\"Caverns of Mars\\", The Creative Atari, 1983 Atari released the cartridge version in 1983.Charlotte Thai, \\"Back to Basics\\", How they Got GameMatt Barton and Bill Loguidice, \\"A History of Gaming Platforms: Atari 8-Bit Computers\\", Gamasutra  Reception  Computer Gaming World called Caverns of Mars \\"delightful ... addictive and excellently paced\\". It noted the age of the author and stated that the game \\"has all the look, feel, and play of a 'professional' program\\". Softline liked the game's use of checkpoints after losing a life, and concluded \\"This game is great; you'll find it difficult to pull yourself away\\". Compute! called Caverns of Marss graphics \\"impressive ‚Ä¶ an excellent use of the Atari's graphics capabilities,\\" noting that the game takes advantage of a little-used mode allowing four colors per character. A Creative Computing reviewer opened with \\"Four minutes later. I was hooked. Four hours later, my wife dragged me away.\\" and concluded by noting that \\"The Caverns of Mars has that indefinable \\"something\\" that makes it arcade-quality\\". The Addison-Wesley Book of Atari Software 1984 gave the game an overall B+ rating, calling it \\"fast-paced and addictive\\" and \\"great fun ... a must for any dedicated arcade game player\\". Electronic Fun gave it a 3.5 out of 5 rating, praising the action and pointing out only a few minor flaws. Caverns of Mars received a Certificate of Merit in the category of \\"Best Science Fiction/Fantasy Computer Game\\" at the 4th annual Arkie Awards,  Legacy  =Mars Mission II= Christensen followed Caverns in 1981 with a lesser-known sequel, known originally as Caverns of Mars II. This version is very similar to Scramble, scrolling horizontally and with rockets that launch upwards from the ground. The game was completed in 1981, but for reasons that are not clear, it was not released. It would not be published until several years later by Antic Software, renamed Mars Mission II.\\"Mars Mission II\\", Atarimania =Phobos= Combining the vertical orientation of the original Caverns with the improved graphics of Caverns II, Phobos was released through APX in 1982, although there are other minor modifications as well.\\"Phobos\\", AllgameKeita Iida, \\"PHOBOS\\", Atari HQ The levels are divided into sub-levels with letters as names; after being killed the action restarts at the top of the sub-level, as opposed to the top of the whole level.

The magazine noted some improvements, such as a pause button and multiple skill levels, but advised that \\"Mars veterans should wait\\". The Addition-Wesley Book of Atari Software 1984 gave the game an overall B rating, stating that \\"whether it is a better game than the original is debatable\\" and concluding that \\"it is a good choice for the dedicated arcade game player\\". =Re-releases= In 2005, a version of Caverns of Mars was included on the Atari Flashback 2 classic game console.\\"Atari Flashback 2 specs\\", cnet =Clones= Datamost's Cavern Creatures (1983) for the Apple II is very similar.

It is commonly used in attempts to prove the validity of telekinesis, by rotating the wheel using the power of the mind. History In the 1968 psychic powers film The Power, a group of witnesses seated around a table watch a stunned telekinetic as a psi wheel turns by the application of telekinetic force by one of the characters. Also, the psi wheel scene can be seen in the film's trailer on YouTube.  Construction  Psi wheel example There are several designs for the shape of the psi wheel, but the most common is an inverted funnel-shaped pyramid. This psi wheel shape may be constructed by creasing a small (around 2 inch by 2 inch) square of paper or foil lengthwise, height wise, and diagonally both ways, then bending the square slightly along the creases to reach the desired shape. Another common type of psi wheel is in the shape of a cross made out of a very thin sheet of metal such as aluminum or brass. The arms of the cross are anywhere from 1.25 to 2 inches in length and up to 1/4\\" wide, with a small dimple in the middle so that it can be balanced on something sharp. This wheel then balances on a sharp pointed object such as a thumbtack, pin, needle, or pen cover firmly planted on a flat surface. An object such as a thumbtack or pen cover can stand on its base by itself, however an object such as a needle will need to be rooted in another stable object such as an eraser, sponge, box, or bottle cap in order to provide it with enough stability to hold the spinning wheel on its tip; one stable design even uses a plastic bottle cap filled with an equal amount of J-B Weld, a quick drying two-part epoxy, to hold a needle of any desired size upright in place. Sometimes such psi wheels are placed within medium-sized glass or clear plastic containers to prevent random bursts of air and possibly heat from the hands from causing spurious movement of the wheel.

Grad and H. Rubin (1958); Vitalii Dmitrievich Shafranov (1966)) is the equilibrium equation in ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) for a two dimensional plasma, for example the axisymmetric toroidal plasma in a tokamak. This equation takes the same form as the Hicks equation from fluid dynamics.Smith, S. G. L., & Hattori, Y. (2012). Axisymmetric magnetic vortices with swirl. Communications in Nonlinear Science and Numerical Simulation, 17(5), 2101-2107. This equation is a two-dimensional, nonlinear, elliptic partial differential equation obtained from the reduction of the ideal MHD equations to two dimensions, often for the case of toroidal axisymmetry (the case relevant in a tokamak). Taking (r,\\\\theta,z) as the cylindrical coordinates, the flux function \\\\psi is governed by the equation, : \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 \\\\psi}{\\\\partial r^2} - \\\\frac{1}{r} \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\psi}{\\\\partial r} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 \\\\psi}{\\\\partial z^2} = -\\\\mu_0 r^{2}\\\\frac{dp}{d\\\\psi}-\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\frac{dF^2}{d\\\\psi}, where \\\\mu_0 is the magnetic permeability, p(\\\\psi) is the pressure, F(\\\\psi)=rB_{\\\\phi} and the magnetic field and current are, respectively, given by : \\\\begin{align} \\\\vec{B} &= \\\\frac{1}{r} abla\\\\psi \\\\times \\\\hat{e}_\\\\theta + \\\\frac{F}{r}\\\\hat{e}_\\\\theta,  \\\\mu_0\\\\vec{J} &= \\\\frac{1}{r}\\\\frac{dF}{d\\\\psi} abla\\\\psi \\\\times \\\\hat{e}_\\\\theta - \\\\left[\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial r}\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{r}\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\psi}{\\\\partial r}\\\\right) + \\\\frac{1}{r}\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 \\\\psi}{\\\\partial z^2}\\\\right] \\\\hat{e}_\\\\theta. \\\\end{align} The nature of the equilibrium, whether it be a tokamak, reversed field pinch, etc. is largely determined by the choices of the two functions F(\\\\psi) and p(\\\\psi) as well as the boundary conditions.  Derivation (in slab coordinates)  In the following, it is assumed that the system is 2-dimensional with z as the invariant axis, i.e. \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial z} = 0 for all quantities. Then the magnetic field can be written in cartesian coordinates as : \\\\mathbf{B} = \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial A}{\\\\partial y},-\\\\frac{\\\\partial A}{\\\\partial x}, B_z(x, y)\\\\right), or more compactly, : \\\\mathbf{B} = abla A \\\\times \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{z}} + B_z \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{z}}, where A(x,y)\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{z}} is the vector potential for the in-plane (x and y components) magnetic field. Note that based on this form for B we can see that A is constant along any given magnetic field line, since abla A is everywhere perpendicular to B. (Also note that -A is the flux function \\\\psi mentioned above.) Two dimensional, stationary, magnetic structures are described by the balance of pressure forces and magnetic forces, i.e.: : abla p = \\\\mathbf{j} \\\\times \\\\mathbf{B}, where p is the plasma pressure and j is the electric current. It is known that p is a constant along any field line, (again since abla p is everywhere perpendicular to B). Additionally, the two-dimensional assumption (\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial z} = 0) means that the z- component of the left hand side must be zero, so the z-component of the magnetic force on the right hand side must also be zero. This means that \\\\mathbf{j}_\\\\perp \\\\times \\\\mathbf{B}_\\\\perp = 0, i.e. \\\\mathbf{j}_\\\\perp is parallel to \\\\mathbf{B}_\\\\perp. The right hand side of the previous equation can be considered in two parts: :\\\\mathbf{j} \\\\times \\\\mathbf{B} = j_z (\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{z}} \\\\times \\\\mathbf{B_\\\\perp}) + \\\\mathbf{j_\\\\perp} \\\\times \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{z}}B_z , where the \\\\perp subscript denotes the component in the plane perpendicular to the z-axis. The z component of the current in the above equation can be written in terms of the one-dimensional vector potential as j_z = -\\\\frac{1}{\\\\mu_0} abla^2 A. . The in plane field is :\\\\mathbf{B}_\\\\perp = abla A \\\\times \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{z}} , and using Maxwell‚ÄìAmp√®re's equation, the in plane current is given by :\\\\mathbf{j}_\\\\perp = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\mu_0} abla B_z \\\\times \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{z}}. In order for this vector to be parallel to \\\\mathbf{B}_\\\\perp as required, the vector abla B_z must be perpendicular to \\\\mathbf{B}_\\\\perp, and B_z must therefore, like p, be a field-line invariant. Rearranging the cross products above leads to :\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{z}} \\\\times \\\\mathbf{B}_\\\\perp = abla A - (\\\\mathbf{\\\\hat z} \\\\cdot abla A) \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat z} = abla A, and :\\\\mathbf{j}_\\\\perp \\\\times B_z\\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{z}} = \\\\frac{B_z}{\\\\mu_0}(\\\\mathbf{\\\\hat z}\\\\cdot abla B_z)\\\\mathbf{\\\\hat z} - \\\\frac{1}{\\\\mu_0}B_z abla B_z = -\\\\frac{1}{\\\\mu_0} B_z abla B_z. These results can be substituted into the expression for abla p to yield: : abla p = -\\\\left[\\\\frac{1}{\\\\mu_0} abla^2 A\\\\right] abla A - \\\\frac{1}{\\\\mu_0} B_z abla B_z. Since p and B_z are constants along a field line, and functions only of A, hence abla p = \\\\frac{dp}{dA} abla A and abla B_z = \\\\frac{d B_z}{dA} abla A. Thus, factoring out abla A and rearranging terms yields the Grad‚ÄìShafranov equation: : abla^2 A = -\\\\mu_0 \\\\frac{d}{dA}\\\\left(p + \\\\frac{B_z^2}{2\\\\mu_0}\\\\right).

Anthony Peeler averaged 16.8 points per game for his Tiger career and left as Missouri's all-time third-leading scorer with 1,970 points, and the all-time leader in assists (497) and steals (196). During his career, he was named first-team All-Big Eight, and in 1992 (his senior year) he was named the conference AP Player of the Year and Male Athlete of the Year and a consensus second-team All-American after averaging 23.4 points, 5.5 rebounds and 3.9 assists per game, and scored a career-high 43 points in a losing cause against arch-rival Kansas. Missouri finished 21‚Äì9 that season and reached the second round of the NCAA Tournament, where they lost to Seton Hall. In 2006, Peeler was named to the Missouri's 30-member All-Century team, in honor of the school's 100th year of competition. Professional career After his college eligibility was up, Peeler was drafted 15th overall by the Los Angeles Lakers in the 1992 NBA draft. Peeler was one of the top 3 shooting guards available (along with Harold Miner and Jim Jackson) and was considered an NBA lottery pick, but his stock dropped off due to off-the-court legal issues. Peeler was placed on five years of probation stemming from an altercation with a woman on the campus of Missouri,Peeler charged with assaulting woman and was accused, mere days before the draft, of being involved in another altercation, this time with an ex-girlfriend he knew from high school.Peeler Faces Assault Charges Again But the Lakers felt that drafting Peeler would be worth the risk if he could help revitalize their backcourt, which was still reeling from Magic Johnson's retirement and only had aging veterans Sedale Threatt and Byron Scott as the legitimate remaining threats at the guard spots. In his rookie year, Peeler appeared in 77 games, starting 11 of them, and became the first Lakers rookie to average double figures (10.4 ppg) since Byron Scott in 1983‚Äì84. He scored a season-high 25 points against the Indiana Pacers on January 28, 1993. Peeler also broke Scott's Lakers rookie record for 3-point shooting. Peeler also played for the Vancouver Grizzlies, Minnesota Timberwolves, Sacramento Kings and the Washington Wizards averaging 9.7 points per game throughout his NBA career. While with Sacramento during the 2003‚Äì04 NBA season, he led the league in three-point field goal accuracy with 48.2 percent. During that season's playoffs, during game 6 matchup between Sacramento and Minnesota, Peeler threw an elbow at former Timberwolves teammate Kevin Garnett, followed by a left hook; Peeler was suspended for 2 games, which included a game 7 loss, which ended the Kings' season, and the season-opener of the Washington Wizards' 2004‚Äì05 campaign, with whom Peeler spent his final year. After the NBA Following retirement from playing, Peeler returned to college and finished his degree at Virginia Union University in Richmond, Virginia. He entered the coaching profession in China by serving as an assistant coach. He had expressed interest in joining the coaching staff of Frank Haith at Missouri in 2011, but no job offer was forthcoming. He is currently awaiting other opportunities.

The game is a combination of side-scrolling action mixed in with some puzzles. The Japanese release featured a synthesized version of the film's score, but in the US version, these songs are replaced by music recycled from Indora no Hikari, another Famicom game from Kemco. Gameplay In the game, the player controls Superman on a quest to save the city of Metropolis from the evil Lex Luthor and a gang of criminals that were exiled from the planet Krypton. The game had an overhead map of various locations in the city that the player can travel to, with animated scenes, but then the gameplay would switch to a more traditional side-scrolling adventure game. Superman has an energy (Super Power) bar and he can collect various icons in the game to use a limited supply of one of his item powers: x-ray vision (make certain enemies visible), superflight, super spin, heat vision (laser attack), and super breath 1 and super breath 2 (freeze enemies). One of the main difference from the comics was that Superman's x-ray vision was used to make invisible enemies visible. The instruction booklet explained that glitch by claiming that \\"Superman is now unable to see inside buildings, as Lex has lined all the buildings in Metropolis with lead!\\" Aside from the item powers, Superman can also jump and punch. Players start out the game as Clark Kent but can change into Superman (provided that they have enough Super Power) by entering into one of the phone booths that are scattered throughout the city. However, taking sufficient damage from enemies would cause Superman to become Clark Kent. Whenever Superman entered the Daily Planet building he would always revert to Clark Kent, no matter what his power level was. The game also came with an area map that split up the districts of Metropolis and allowed Superman to use his superflight power to quickly change areas. Occasionally a \\"Help!\\" signal would appear on the map, such as a person being mugged, to which Superman could fly to that area immediately and aid the person in need. At the end of each city level, or \\"chapter\\", the player battles a different boss and, upon defeating the boss, is given an animated front page of a Daily Planet newspaper praising their success. The second to the last chapter boss in the game is Lex Luthor. This is followed by three fights in a row against the exiled criminals from Krypton; Ursa, Non and General Zod at the \\"Statue of Freedom\\", which looks like the Statue of Liberty.

The project overlaps part of the Atlantic Terminal Urban Renewal Area, but also extends toward the adjacent brownstone neighborhood. Of the project, is located over a Long Island Rail Road train yard. A major component of the project is the Barclays Center sports arena, which opened on September 21, 2012. Formerly named Atlantic Yards, the project was renamed by the developer in August 2014 as part of a rebranding. The development of Pacific Park is overseen by the Empire State Development Corporation. , four of fifteen planned buildings had opened, but the deadline was delayed by about 10 years from 2025 to 2035. The residential component includes the world's tallest modular apartment building, 461 Dean, opened in November 2016.Garfield, Leanna (April 6, 2017) \\"11 billion-dollar mega-projects that will transform New York City by 2035\\" Business InsiderGarfield, Leanna (November 16, 2016) \\"The world's tallest modular apartment building just opened in New York City ‚Äî take a look inside\\" Business Insider History =Context= Since the mid-20th century, there have been many proposals to develop the area around Flatbush and Atlantic Avenues, known as Times Plaza; however, plans for the area emerged only piecemeal. In the mid-1950s, Brooklyn Dodgers owner Walter O'Malley proposed that the city condemn the site, where he could then have built a new stadium for the ball club to replace Ebbets Field. City officials refused to condemn the property for subsequent sale to O'Malley on the grounds that they did not consider a privately financed baseball park to be an appropriate public purpose as defined under Title I of the Federal housing act of 1949. O'Malley's proposal was dismissed by Robert Moses for creating a Great Wall of traffic. In 1958, O'Malley relocated the Dodgers to Los Angeles. In 1968, Long Island University eyed the site, but was opposed by Mayor John V. Lindsay. A 1968 New York Times article described the $250 million (over $1.4 billion in March 2006 dollars) plan for the Atlantic Terminal Urban Renewal Area, also known as ATURA. According to the Times, the renewal plan \\"calls for 2,400 new low- and middle-income housing units to replace 800 dilapidated units, removal of the blighting Fort Greene Meat Market, a site for the City University's new Baruch College, two new parks, and community facilities such as day-care centers.\\"\\"Renewal Raises Brooklyn Hopes\\", The New York Times, June 24, 1968 The 1970s also saw plans for ambitious projects in the area, and these mostly resulted in the construction of affordable housing on the north side of Atlantic Avenue. Baruch College also considered moving but was stymied by the City's fiscal crisis. The seeds of gentrification were planted with the establishment of the Fort Greene Historic District in 1978. A Fort Greene block association and other homeowners sued over an environmental impact statement that failed to consider how rerouted traffic would affect their neighborhood, one block away from the project. Then an economic downturn compounded community opposition. The Times reported that the stock market collapse had deterred office construction. \\"A lot of people are reassessing their expansion plans,\\" James Stuckey, president of the city's Public Development Corporation, told the Times in 1988. =Development= Abandoned plan of 2008 The Vanderbilt Railyards represents of the site (as seen in September 2006) The project's name, devised by developer Forest City Ratner, relates to the rail yard located between Atlantic Avenue and Pacific Street. Officially, the Long Island Rail Road yard is called the \\"Vanderbilt Yard\\" by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (named for Vanderbilt Avenue that crosses over on its way to the Brooklyn Navy Yard). The LIRR's nearby Atlantic Terminal station is the westernmost stop of the Atlantic Branch. Easy access by rapid transit and suburban rail, and the desirable brownstone housing stock nearby made it a target for speculative development. The Pacific Park project is being developed and overseen by Forest City Ratner, an arm of Forest City Enterprises, of Cleveland, Ohio and the original master plan and some individual buildings were by architect Frank Gehry. Gehry was removed from the project in June 2009. Since September 2009, the new arena design has been a collaboration between Ellerbe Becket and the Manhattan architectural firm SHoP Architects. Pacific Park, overseen by the Empire State Development Corporation, is supposed to be a public-private project, Bruce Ratner told Crain's New York Business in November 2009. In March 2008, principal developer Bruce Ratner acknowledged that the slowing economy may delay construction of both the office and residential components of the project for several years.Slow Economy Likely to Stall Atlantic Yards By CHARLES V. BAGLI New York Times March 21, 2008 On June 23, 2008, the Supreme Court of the United States refused to hear an appeal of the federal eminent domain case. The case was refiled in state court, with slightly different arguments, and in November 2009, the project cleared what the New York Times called the \\"final major obstacle\\" when the New York Court of Appeals dismissed the final challenge to the legality of eminent domain. Further challenges to the implementation of eminent domain ensued, and were dismissed in March 2010. The most prominent member of the neighborhood opposition, Daniel Goldstein, agreed under pressure to a settlement in April 2010, allowing for vacant possession, the sale of the Nets to Mikhail Prokhorov, and the release of arena construction bonds from escrow. The Barclays Center, for which groundbreaking for construction occurred on March 11, 2010, was opened to the public on September 21, 2012, which was also attended by some 200 protesters. It held its first event with a Jay-Z concert on September 28, 2012. In June 2014, Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that the Atlantic Yards complex would be completed by 2025. That August, the Atlantic Yards complex was renamed Pacific Park. In addition, plans for a new building comprising affordable units, the 298-unit, 18-story building at 535 Carlton Avenue, was unveiled, and a new public park was also revealed. The China-based developer Greenland Holdings, along with Forest City, started the sale of 278 condos in summer 2015. The units at 550 Vanderbilt Avenue, which cost between $550,000 and $5.5 million, will be sold by Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group. , the last seven property owners in the area are to leave by April 2015. Most of the project's Phase 1 was complete by August 2016. The master plan features a total of 16 buildings. However, by 2018, only four of the originally planned fifteen buildings had been completed. The developers stated that it may take until 2035 until the project is completed, since the project was given that build-out date when the project was re-approved in 2009. Elements of the project =Land use= The development is sited in Prospect Heights, a gentrifying area where the median price of a residential unit exceeded $1 million in 2019. The bulk of the project site was a mixture of public streets, private homes and small businesses. Forest City Ratner controls much of this private property and has benefited from the state's use of eminent domain to acquire and close the streets. The land is owned by New York State, and the developer has a 99-year lease. The Public Authorities Control Board, which effectively ended the West Side Stadium plan, approved the state financing of the Atlantic Yards plan in December 2006. =Barclays Center= The Barclays Center is the new home arena of the National Basketball Association's Brooklyn Nets, and the NHL's New York Islanders which was purchased by a group led by principal developer Bruce Ratner with the intention of making it and the arena the centerpiece of the whole project. This brought major league professional sports to Brooklyn for the first time since the Brooklyn Dodgers moved to Los Angeles, California after the 1957 season. The arena‚Äôs design once included an ice skating rink and a green roof. An NBA basketball team now owned primarily by Russia's second richest man Mikhail Prokhorov, the Nets began playing at the Barclays Center arena in 2012. Formerly the New Jersey Nets, the Nets re-branded themselves when they moved to the Barclays Center. Prokhorov is an avid basketball fan, and, with 80 percent ownership in the Nets, he has become the first Russian owner of a major U.S. professional sports franchise. The deal was necessary for Ratner, who was risking losing tax-exempt financing and the Barclays naming-rights deal if he did not break ground within three months' time. =Zoning= Ground was broken on the first residential building at Pacific Park ‚Äî B2 ‚Äî on December 18, 2012. The building will have 363 units, 50% of those units will be affordable. In March 2011, The New York Times revealed that Forest City Ratner was considering building a 34-story apartment building out of prefabricated units. If constructed, it will be the largest prefabricated structure in the world. Given that, it is likely to face new engineering challenges, and it is not yet certain whether it can be constructed economically. However, if construction turns out to be feasible, the move is likely to save considerable building costs, because construction in a factory is cheaper than at a field site. While satisfying affordable housing advocates, it is likely to anger construction unions, who have been major supporters of the project. At 32 storeys tall, B2 will be the tallest building in the world constructed using modular technology. The housing component of the project has been criticized for its urban density. The construction of a 34-story prefabricated building, while not the first prefab high-rise in the city, would be the largest. However, B2 will be completed in late 2015 ‚Äî more than ten years after Atlantic Yard's commencement ‚Äî instead of 2014, the original expected completion date. It was only 13% complete . One or two buildings in the Pacific Park project would be used for office space, though the office market is poor. Retail space would be built at the ground level of buildings. Transportation LIRR train is on the right. The project is sited above the Vanderbilt train yards belonging to the adjacent Atlantic Terminal station, after which the Atlantic Yards development was first named; this is the westernmost stop on the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR)'s Atlantic Branch. It is the primary terminal for the Far Rockaway, Hempstead, and, on weekdays, West Hempstead Branches. The location is also served by a number of bus lines. The development sits near the intersection of Atlantic Avenue and Flatbush Avenue. It is one of the biggest, and the most congested, intersections in Brooklyn. The increase of car traffic to the area caused by extra housing and the construction of an arena has been frequently cited by critics as a major reason for their opposition to the project. According to the Environmental Impact Statement, the addition of more than 15,000 new residents would not significantly impact vehicular traffic, a claim contested by the Council of Brooklyn Neighborhoods. While traffic was a concern to some it has been noted that there has not been an increase in traffic associated with the arena opening while there has been a large increase in subway and Long Island Railroad use. The Pacific Park project, at its western end, is adjacent to the Atlantic Avenue‚ÄìBarclays Center station‚Äîthe largest New York City Subway station in Brooklyn and among the largest transit hubs in New York City‚Äîserving the . The project features a new $76 million subway entrance near the front of Barclays Center. The Lafayette Avenue () and Fulton Street () subway stations are also nearby.  Public opinion  = The Community Benefits Agreement = The edition of October 22, 2005 of The Brooklyn Paper revealed that the Forest City Ratner (FCR) company had paid large sums of money to organizations, offering what they've presented as grassroots neighborhood support for the proposed Pacific Park development. Back on December 20, 2004, six months before the so-called \\"community benefits agreement\\" (CBA) was drafted, a non-governmental pact between the developer and community groups, the 501(c)(3) filings of Brooklyn United for Innovative Local Development (BUILD) stated it would receive $5 million from Bruce Ratner's company in exchange for support. BUILD president James Caldwell is being paid $125,000 a year, and two other BUILD executives‚Äî Mary Louis and Shalawn Langhorne‚Äî are receiving $100,000 a year, according to the IRS document. Additionally, the development company has also paid $50,000 to Reverend Herbert Daughtry, another CBA endorser. His organization, Downtown Brooklyn Neighborhood Alliance, is commissioned to help create an inter- generational center as part of the Ratner plan to \\"retain staff to begin to develop a program to create these facilities.\\" The political arm of BUILD, Community Leadership for Accountable Politics (CLAP), is apparently folding. A Community Benefit Agreement, that claimed to be modeled on the first of its kind for the Staples Center in Los Angeles, was signed on June 27, 2005 between Forest City Ratner and a consortium of community groups to provide a range of benefits for the community. Many of these community groups are led by long standing and prominent leaders including Bertha Lewis, Executive Director of ACORN, James Caldwell, ED for Brooklyn United for Innovative Local Development and Rev. Herbert Daughtry, pastor of House of the Lord Church. One of the controversies surrounding the CBA is the definition of \\"community\\", and many local groups contend that they will not be included. Among the benefits accruing to the community as defined under this legally binding agreement are: *Affordable housing (for households earning up to $109,000 a year ‚Äì 50% set aside with various degrees of affordability as set out in the agreement), *35% minority, and 10% women contractors hired during construction *Senior housing (10% set aside of all rental units) *Health care center within the project *Six acres of open space for use by the public free of charge on the project site of open space for a project of this size is considered inadequate by city standards. Opponents note that this is not the same as public space, rather it is private space open to the public at the owner's discretion. The developer will get this space after current publicly owned streetscapes are privatized. Signatories to this agreement are All-Faith Council of Brooklyn, Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN), Brooklyn United for Innovative Local Development (BUILD), Downtown Brooklyn Neighborhood Alliance (DBNA), Downtown Brooklyn Educational Consortium (DBEC), First Atlantic Terminal Housing Committee (FATHC), New York State Association of Minority Contractors (NYSAMC), Public Housing Communities (PHC). Copies of the full CBA are available at the offices of each of these organizations. While the Staples Center CBA included hundreds of community groups‚Äîmany who did not originally support the project‚Äîthe Atlantic Yards CBA signatories all supported the project before signing on. One group, BUILD, has been shown to have repeatedly lied about the funding it received from the developer. The known amount of total payments to CBA signatories from the developer is $538,000. =Controversy= The alt=A room with ornate brown wooden paneling and oil portraits on the walls. At the left seven people wearing black robes sit behind a similarly decorated wooden bench, elevated slightly from the red- carpeted floor. On the right are several people in suits sitting at chairs behind tables. In the rear is a large window with red drapes. In a Huffington Post blog, Daniel Goldstein called Pacific Park, then named Atlantic Yards, \\"a corrupt land grab,\\" \\"a taxpayer ripoff\\", \\"a bait and switch of epic proportions\\", and \\"a complete failure of democracy.\\" Goldstein, who co-founded Develop Don't Destroy Brooklyn and was the last remaining homeowner (the condo apartment he owned is where the arena's center court is now located) had his home taken by eminent domain by New York State on March 1, 2010 after nearly 8 years of court battles. At that time New York State took sole ownership of his home and moved to evict him, his wife and toddler daughter. At his eviction hearing on April 21, 2010 Brooklyn judge Abraham Gerges forced the Empire State Development Corporation and Mr. Goldstein to settle on an imminent eviction date (May 7) and the constitutionally required just compensation for the home they had seized. The compensation was for $3 million, $760,000 of which went to Mr. Goldstein's attorney Mike Rikon. FCR eventually boosted its bid to $100 million, and said the overall value of its bid was higher than the appraised value, which was validated by the courts. Forest City Ratner offered the condo owners in 636 Pacific St. $850/sq. foot, the condo owners at 24 Sixth Ave (Spalding Buildings) $650/sq. foot and undisclosed amounts to renters. Sellers of condos signed a nondisclosure agreement, termed a \\"gag order\\" by opponents. =Support= The project is endorsed by the MTA and former Mayor Michael Bloomberg, has been strongly supported by former Brooklyn Borough President Marty Markowitz, who sees this project as the opportunity to finally produce the business district in Downtown Brooklyn that was intended with the construction of the Williamsburgh Savings Bank Tower but was halted by the Great Depression. The project has also been endorsed by three former governors during its pendency since 2003 (George Pataki, Eliot Spitzer, and David Paterson), who control the state agencies‚ÄîEmpire State Development Corporation (ESDC) and Metropolitan Transportation Authority‚Äîthat are key to the project. The most fervent public support had come from Markowitz, who saw the project as the opportunity to bring professional sports back to Brooklyn. US Senator Charles Schumer, Congressman Gregory W. Meeks, former Congressmen Edolphus Towns and Anthony Weiner, former State Senator Carl Kruger, and former Comptroller William C. Thompson, Jr. have also supported the project. Job development in the boroughs outside of Manhattan was stated as part of former Mayor Bloomberg's agenda and, in this case especially, had been seen as a way to stem the tide of companies leaving New York City for New Jersey and other locations. While rents in Manhattan are prohibitive for some companies, offering lower rent office space in the boroughs may be a way to keep jobs in the city and maintain the tax base that sustains municipal services. Spearheaded by Bloomberg, the project has received the approval of the Empire State Development Corporation. At least 30% of the project's units are reserved for low-, moderate- or middle-income tenants, so some people advocating affordable housing also supported the project. One of the more prominent members of this group was ACORN, which signed the Affordable Housing Memorandum of Understanding with developer Forest City Ratner in 2005. Construction workers have been another group of strong supporters for the project. Anchor of Fox's Good Day New York, Rosanna Scotto, a native of the Dyker Heights section of Brooklyn, is a supporter of the project. =Opposition= The most vocal opposition group was a nonprofit named Develop Don't Destroy Brooklyn, though other organizations are opposed to or seek to scale back the project. These organizations include: 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement, Boerum Hill Association (BHA), Central Brooklyn Independent Democrats (CBID), Committee For Environmentally Sound Development, Creative Industries Coalition (80 local businesses, galleries and collectives), Democracy for New York City (DFNYC). Other neighborhood organizations that are critical of the project are gathered under the banner of 'BrooklynSpeaks', which initially eschewed a litigation strategy but in 2009 finally went to court, in a case combined with one filed by Develop Don't Destroy Brooklyn charging that the Empire State Development Corporation (ESDC) failed to consider the impact of an additional fifteen years of construction on the surrounding neighborhood when it approved a renegotiated project plan in September 2009. In November 2010, New York State Supreme Court Judge Marcy Friedman ruledhttp://www.brooklynspeaks.net/sites/default/files/ay_reargument_decision.pdf in favor of the petitioners, ordering the ESDC to either provide a justification for its continued use of the original ten-year construction schedule, or otherwise conduct a supplemental environmental impact study. BrooklynSpeaks and DDDB subsequently sought a stay of construction in advance of ESDC's response to the Court order. In addition to these and a variety of well-established community groups in the area, the development has been opposed by now-city public advocate Letitia James, formerly the New York City Council member for the district. Critics point to the lack of transparency of the project, the lack of democratic review of the process, mixed successes of Ratner's previous projects, the use of eminent domain to remove residents for a commercial interest. Under the project, 68 residential or business properties were to be seized and razed; it would also cause increased traffic congestion, light pollution, gentrification, and crowding. Cory Booker, then mayor of Newark, campaigned for the New Jersey Nets to abandon plans to play at Pacific Park, and instead relocate permanently to the Prudential Center in downtown Newark, already home to the New Jersey Devils and Seton Hall Pirates; however, he later embraced the team's interim move to Newark, from fall 2010 to 2012. On February 14, 2006, New York State Supreme Court Justice Carol Edmead ruled in favor of the dismissal of attorney David Paget as the ESDC's outside counsel. Paget, who has been advising the ESDC in its environmental review of the Atlantic Yards project, had previously also worked for FCR companies until October 2005. Justice Edmead concluded that the appointment of Paget to the ESDC represented a conflict of interest, calling it \\"a severe, crippling appearance of impropriety.\\" Furthermore, Justice Edmead gave the ESDC 45 days to find a new attorney to meet the standard of \\"objective public interest.\\" On May 30, 2006, the Appellate Division, First Department, reversed Justice Edmead's the decision. \\"The motion court misapprehended material facts and misapplied the applicable law in granting the petition to the extent of disqualifying Paget and his law firm from representing ESDC,\\" Justice Milton Williams wrote for a unanimous panel. The 2007 documentary film Brooklyn Matters took a critical look at the development project, attracting minor controversy from people apparently in support of the development. Environmental impact An issue concerning wastewater management was brought up during a preliminary environmental impact assessment of the project, catching the attention of Carroll Gardens residents. According to the edition of March 4, 2006 of The Brooklyn Paper, the sewage created from the development will flow into antiquated city-run sewer and waste treatment systems ‚Äî which overload when it rains. The result, is that allegedly of untreated wastewater will drain into waterways around the city each year, including 13 spigots on the Gowanus Canal. Lawsuit by community groups In late October 2006 community groups filed a lawsuit in federal court against Bloomberg, Governor George Pataki, and Bruce Ratner of Forest City Ratner to stop the project. The plaintiffs are charging that the project would not serve public use, and that this is required by legal precedent. The suit, Goldstein v. Pataki, is being led by Matthew Brinkerhoff. The lawsuit was prompted by an open letter to the Village Voice, which appeared on the www.nolandgrab.org website. This letter stated that Justice Kennedy's Kelo concurring opinion could be used to attack eminent domain as a violation of minimum scrutiny, which says that government policy (including an eminent domain use) must be rationally related to a legitimate government purpose.

Although it is relatively close to the Sun at just 12 light years, this star cannot be seen with the naked eye. It is classified as a flare star that undergoes intermittent fluctuations in luminosity. YZ Ceti is about 13 percent the mass of the Sun and 17% of its radius. This star is unusually close to Tau Ceti, a star of spectral class G8. The two are only about 1.6 light years apart, a little more than a third of the distance from the Sun to the Solar System's nearest neighbor, Proxima Centauri. Variability YZ Ceti is a variable star designation: the star shows occasional rapid and brief increases in brightness, sometimes reaching magnitude 12.03, caused by eruptions from the surface. This type of variable star is known as a UV Ceti star after its first member, or more colloquially as a flare star. It also shows small periodic variations in brightness caused by starspots or chromospheric features moving as the star rotates. This class of variable stars are known as BY Draconis variables. The periodic variations allow the rotational period of the star to be measured at 68.3 days, although modelling of its planetary system gives a rotational period for the star of 83 days. Planetary system On 10 August 2017 three planets were announced to have been discovered around YZ Ceti and a possible fourth sub-Earth planet candidate, still needing confirmation, with 0.472¬±0.096 Earth masses at an orbital period of 1.04 days. The orbits of the three confirmed planets were determined to be too close to YZ Ceti to be within the star's habitable zone, with equilibrium temperatures ranging from 347‚Äì491 K (74‚Äì218 ¬∞C; 165‚Äì424 ¬∞F), 299‚Äì423 K (26‚Äì150 ¬∞C; 79‚Äì302 ¬∞F), and 260‚Äì368 K (‚àí13‚Äì95 ¬∞C; 8‚Äì203 ¬∞F) for planets b, c, and d, respectively. An August 2018 study reexamined the discovery measurements, confirming the orbit of YZ Ceti d, but finding a possibly marginally longer orbital period of YZ Ceti b of 2.02 days rather than 1.97 days, and additionally finding that YZ Ceti c probably orbits in only 0.75 days rather than 3.06 days. If the latter is true, YZ Ceti c would have a mass of only 0.58 Earth masses and a roughly 10% chance of transiting YZ Ceti.

He held a brief, controversial tenure as publisher of the Los Angeles Times, and served as interim CEO of Yahoo for two months in 2012 after serving as Executive Vice President, Americas, and Head of Global Media. Levinsohn previously served as President of Fox Interactive.  Early life  Levinsohn was raised in Tenafly, New Jersey, the son of Joyce (n√©e Salton) and Jay Douglas Levinsohn. He graduated from American University with a bachelor's degree in broadcast communications.  Work  = Early career = Levinsohn and his college roommate started a promotional company, Ross Productions that staged events for college students and young professionals. He joined HBO in 1989, working in marketing and promotions for Time Warner Sports. In 1994, he helped develop content for CompuServe, Prodigy and America Online. In 1995, GQ Magazine recognized him as one of the \\"30 under 30\\" media execs by GQ Magazine. In early 1996 Levinsohn joined SportsLine USA in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida. He produced a syndicated television show starring NFL coaches Marv Levy and Sam Wyche, and host Scott Kaplan, entitled \\"Football Playbook,\\" and syndicated radio programming on Westwood One. = Alta Vista = Levinsohn was hired by Alta Vista to help launch the portal division in 1999. That year, Compaq sold a majority stake in AltaVista to CMGI, an Internet investment company. CMGI filed for an initial public offering (IPO) for AltaVista, but the IPO was cancelled when the Internet bubble collapsed. Alta Vista's popularity rapidly slipped, losing market share to other search engines, especially Google. After a series of layoffs and several management changes, AltaVista shed the portal division that Levinsohn helped launch, and refocused on search. = News Corporation = From 2001 to 2005, Levinsohn was Senior Vice President and General Manager at Fox Sports Interactive Media, a division of News Corporation. In late 2004, he was named president of Fox Interactive Media and assumed day-to-day operating responsibility for the main Fox web properties. Levinsohn left in November 2006 and was replaced by his cousin. = Yahoo and aftermath = In October 2010, Ross Levinsohn was hired as executive vice president of the Americas for Yahoo. Under his purview, Yahoo acquired 5to1, a digital advertising network that Levinsohn helped found, for $28 million from Levinsohn's partner at the firm, James Heckman. In 2012, Levinsohn led Yahoo for two months as interim CEO. After the board of directors passed him over for the permanent CEO position, hiring Google executive Marissa Mayer, Levinsohn left the company. Levinsohn became executive chairman of a short-lived company named Scout Media, which went bankrupt. Levinsohn and Heckman, who was his business partner, were named as defendants in a shareholder lawsuit filed in 2017 in federal court, which claimed that the company's \\"rosy image\\" was a sham, with unpaid rent and vendor invoices piling up, and finances in \\"complete disarray.\\" He joined the board of directors of the media company Tribune Company as the media brand emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy. He later became CEO of Guggenheim Digital Media, an offshoot of Guggenheim Partners, the investment firm that then was the controlling owner of the Hollywood Reporter and Billboard. =Los Angeles Times= On 21 August 2017, Levinsohn was named the publisher and CEO of the Los Angeles Times by tronc, replacing Davan Maharaj. In his most public and controversial move, he hired Lewis D'Vorkin, the former editor of Forbes magazine. Known as \\"journalism's prince of darkness,\\" D'Vorkin pioneered the contributor network model that flooded the Forbes website with content \\"of suspect quality and journalistic value.\\" The Los Angeles Times newsroom filed for a union election in December 2017, four months after Levinsohn was hired, and held a union election on 4 January 2018. Levinsohn was put on unpaid leave in January 2018 after NPR reported his comments in the Alta Vista deposition, including speculating \\"about whether a woman who worked for him... was a stripper on the side.\\" Two witnesses said they were shocked to see Levinsohn, while he was the CEO of Guggenheim Digital Media, \\"aggressively kissing and pressing himself against a woman at a glitzy music industry dinner in plain view of his subordinates and his clients.\\" The Los Angeles Times newsroom's election vote was certified by the National Labor Relations Board on 19 January 2018, the day after the NPR story published. Executives at tronc said an independent investigation into Levinsohn's behavior cleared him of wrongdoing, but did not release the report. Levinsohn was reinstated and named to a new position as CEO of Tribune Interactive on 8 February 2018. Levinsohn later told Business Insider that the NPR story was \\"full of inaccuracies, half truths and lies,\\" but did not \\"directly deny\\" what he said in a deposition in the sexual misconduct lawsuits. =Maven, Inc.= In June 2019, Levinsohn was named by the Maven, Inc., a Seattle-based digital publishing firm owned by Heckman, to lead Sports Illustrated following a deal to license the brand from Authentic Brands Group. In October 2019, the company removed longtime editor- in-chief Chris Stone from his position and announced that 40 journalists would be laid off and replaced with \\"as many as 200 contract workers.\\" Levinsohn and the Maven are attempting to turn Sports Illustrated from a print publication into a localized content mill that farms out work to several dozen staffers who are required to form limited liability companies to avoid the legal problems posed by similar sites such as SB Nation.

Biography =Soviet legal scholar= Anatoly Sobchak was born in Chita, Russian SFSR, Soviet Union, on 10 August 1937. His father, Aleksander Antonovich, was a railroad engineer, and his mother, Nadezhda Andreyevna Litvinova, was an accountant. Anatoly was one of four brothers. In 1939, the family moved to Uzbekistan, where Anatoly lived until 1953 before entering Stavropol Law College. In 1954, he transferred to Leningrad State University. In 1958, he married Nonna Gandzyuk, a student of Hertzen Teacher's College. They had a daughter called Maria Sobchak, born in 1965, who is currently a St Petersburg lawyer while her son Gleb Sobchak, born in 1983, graduated from the Law Faculty of St. Petersburg State University.\\"sobchak.org\\", accessed 12 October 2012.\\"granitim.ru\\", accessed 12 October 2012. After graduating from Leningrad State University, he worked for three years as a lawyer in Stavropol, then returned to Leningrad State University for graduate studies (1962‚Äì1965). After obtaining his Ph.D., he taught law at the Leningrad Police School and the Leningrad Institute for Cellulose and Paper Industries' Technology (1965‚Äì1973), and between 1973 and 1990 he taught at Leningrad State University. In 1980, he married Lyudmila Narusova, at that time a history student at the Leningrad Academy of Soviet Culture and later a prominent MP. They had a daughter, Ksenia Sobchak. After obtaining his D.Sc. in 1982, he was appointed Professor and Head of the Department of Common Law in Socialist Economics. He was very popular among law students, especially for his mildly anti-government comments. During his work at Leningrad State University, he established close relations with its then administrator of international affairs, Vladimir Putin, which he maintained for the rest of his life. =Legislator= In 1989, after election laws changed during Perestroika, he was elected as an independent candidate to the Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union. He was one of only a few deputies who had a legal background, so he contributed enormously to most of the laws created from 1989 to 1991. He became one of the founders and a co- chairman of the Inter-Regional Deputies Group along with Andrei Sakharov and Boris Yeltsin. He also was a chairman of the Parliamentary Commission on the Investigation of the events of 9 April 1989 in Tbilisi. The Commission condemned the military, which was blamed for many deaths when dispersing demonstrators. The Commission's report made it more difficult to use military force against civil demonstrations in the Soviet Union and Russia. He was a member of the President's Consultative Council during Mikhail Gorbachev's tenure and contributed to legislation that originated from the presidential administration. After the Soviet Union was dissolved in 1991, Sobchak was not a member of the central Parliament but was a member of Yeltsin's Presidential Council and the chairman of the Constitutional Assembly that prepared the Constitution of the Russian Federation in 1993. The constitution is often informally called Sobchak's constitution, although its real authors have been somewhat less known. =Mayor of Saint Petersburg= In April 1990, Sobchak was elected a deputy of the Leningrad City Council, and in May he became the chairman of the Council. From the beginning, his leadership was marked by a strongly authoritarian bent.Inside Putin's Russia, Andrew Jack, pp. 69‚Äì70. The Council decided to change the structure of the city governance so as to have a Mayor elected by direct elections. The first of such elections in June 1991 were combined with the referendum on the city name. Sobchak won the elections, and the city voted to return to its historical name of Saint Petersburg. The name change was established in one of the last sessions of the Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union, held on 12 September 1991. The change needed an amendment of the Constitution of the Soviet Union and its passage required much effort by Sobchak. Sobchak was Mayor of Saint Petersburg from 1991 to 1996. During his tenure, the city became a place of glamorous cultural and sporting events. Most of the everyday control of the city structure was handled by two Mayor's deputies ‚Äì Vladimir Yakovlev and Vladimir Putin; critics alleged deterioration of city infrastructure, growing corruption, and crime during this time. In the 1996 mayoral election, Sobchak was opposed by his former first deputy Vladimir Yakovlev and lost by a margin of 1.2%. The major pitch of Yakovlev's campaign was that Sobchak's patronage of the arts (with city money) and involvement in federal politics prevented him from solving the real problems of the city.–°–∫–æ–Ω—á–∞–ª–∞—Å—å –ú–∞—Ä–∏–Ω–∞ –°–∞–ª—å–µ, —á—å—è –∫–æ–º–∏—Å—Å–∏—è –Ω–µ–∫–æ–≥–¥–∞ –Ω–∞—à–ª–∞ –≤ —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–µ –ü—É—Ç–∏–Ω–∞ –º–∞—Ö–∏–Ω–∞—Ü–∏–∏ –Ω–∞ 100 –º–ª–Ω –¥–æ–ª–ª–∞—Ä–æ–≤ = Emigration and return = In 1997, a criminal investigation started against Sobchak. He was accused of irregularities in the privatization of his own apartment, his elder daughter's apartment, and his wife's art studio. By the standards of the 1990s in Russia, the allegations were relatively minor (although the alleged losses for city finances were still in the tens of thousands of dollars). Thus, Sobchak's supporters saw the criminal proceedings as a political repression. According to Ksenia Sobchak, this campaign was started in 1995 from Moscow to prevent her father from running in future presidential elections. On 7 November 1997, Sobchak flew to Paris on a private plane without passport processing on the Russian side. The formal reason for his departure was medical treatment in a Paris hospital for his heart condition, but Sobchak never checked in at the hospital. Between 1997 and 1999, he lived the typical life of a political √©migr√© in Paris. In June 1999, his friend Vladimir Putin became much stronger politically (in a few weeks he became the Prime Minister of Russia), and he was able to make the prosecutors drop the charges against Sobchak. On 12 June 1999, Sobchak returned to Russia. After his return, Sobchak became a very active supporter of Putin in his quest for the Russian presidency. =Death= Sobchak's wife Lyudmila Narusova (centre), daughter Ksenia Sobchak (far right) and Vladimir Putin at his funeral On 17 February 2000, Putin met with Sobchak and urged him to travel to Kaliningrad to support his election campaign. Sobchak traveled there, accompanied by two assistants who also served as his bodyguards. On 20 February 2000, Sobchak died suddenly in the town of Svetlogorsk of the Kaliningrad Oblast. The initial suspected cause of death was a heart attack, but the findings of two medical experts were contradictory.Gessen, Masha (2012).

In sailing, gaskets are lengths of rope or fabric used for reefing a sail, or hold a stowed sail in place. In modern use, the term is usually restricted to square-rigged ships, the equivalent items on yachts being referred to by the more prosaic \\"sail ties\\". On most ships, gaskets are made of rope. They are attached to the top of the yard and, left loose, would hang behind the sail. Gaskets should never be left dangling, however, so when the sail is set they are brought around underneath the yard and up the back of it and then tied to the jackstay (metal rod) where they originated. Alternatively, longer gaskets - particularly the clew gaskets described below - can be secured using a gasket coil. When the sail is to be stowed it is first folded and bagged neatly within itself, pulled onto the top of the yard, and then the gaskets are brought round over it and secured to the jackstay to hold it in place. Gaskets should be tied with a slippery hitch to enable them to be let off quickly, though if the yard is large there may only be enough rope to form a clove hitch when the gasket is brought round it. Most ships are equipped with clew gaskets at the outer ends of the yards. These do not pass around the sail, but through a shackle or ring on the blocks of the sheet. Pulled tight and secured to the jackstay or the yard's lift, this takes the load off the clewline and sail, and should allow the blocks to be lifted higher, dragging the sail down less and enabling a neater stow.

JSTOR, https://www.jstor.org/stable/41640815 Plot summary Chapter I Hadleyburg enjoys the reputation of being an \\"incorruptible\\" town known for its responsible, honest people that are trained to avoid temptation. However, at some point the people of Hadleyburg manage to offend a passing stranger, and he vows to get his revenge by corrupting the town. The stranger drops off a sack in Hadleyburg, at the house of Edward and Mary Richards. It contains slightly over 160 pounds of gold coins and is to be given to a man in the town who purportedly gave the stranger $20 and some life-changing advice in his time of need years earlier. To identify the man, a letter with the sack suggests that anyone who claims to know what the advice was should write the remark down and submit it to Reverend Burgess, who will open the sack at a public meeting and find the actual remark inside. News of the mysterious sack of gold, whose value is estimated at $40,000, spreads throughout the town and even gains attention across the country. Chapter II The residents beam with pride as stories of the sack and Hadleyburg's honesty spread throughout the nation, but the mood soon changes. Initially reluctant to give into the temptation of the gold, soon even the most upstanding citizens are trying to guess the remark. Edward and Mary, one of the town's 19 model couples, receive a letter from a stranger revealing the remark: \\"You are far from being a bad man: go, and reform.\\" Mary is ecstatic that they will be able to claim the gold. Unbeknownst to one another, all 19 couples have received identical letters. They submit their claims to Burgess and begin to recklessly purchase things on credit in anticipation of their future wealth. Chapter III The town hall meeting to decide the rightful owner of the sack arrives, and it is packed with residents, outsiders, and reporters. Burgess reads the first two claims, and a dispute quickly arises between two townspeople who have submitted nearly the same remark. To settle which is right, Burgess cuts open the sack and finds the note that reveals the full remark: \\"You are far from being a bad man‚Äîgo, and reform‚Äîor, mark my words‚Äîsome day, for your sins you will die and go to hell or Hadleyburg‚Äîtry and make it the former.\\" Neither man's claim includes the entire remark. The next claim reads the same, and the town hall bursts into laughter at the obvious dishonesty behind the incorrect claims. Burgess continues to read the rest of the claims, all with the same (partial) remark, and one by one the prominent couples of the town are publicly shamed. Edward and Mary await their name with anguish, but surprisingly it is never read. With all the claims presented, another note in the sack is opened. It reveals that the stranger fabricated the entire scenario in order to avenge himself for the offense he suffered while traveling through Hadleyburg. He says that it was foolish for the citizens to always avoid temptation, because it is easy to corrupt those who have never had their resolve tested. Burgess discovers that the sack contains not gold but gilded lead pieces. A townsperson proposes to auction the lead off and give the money to Edward and Mary, the only prominent couple in town that did not have their name read off. Edward and Mary are in despair, unsure whether to come clean and stop the auction or to accept the money. The stranger who set up the whole scheme in the first place is revealed to have been in the town hall the whole time. He wins the auction, then makes a deal to sell the sack to one of the townspeople for $40,000 and give $10,000 of that money to Edward and Mary. He gives them $1,500 cash at the meeting and promises to deliver the remaining $8,500 the next morning, once his buyer has paid him. Chapter IV The following day the stranger delivers checks totaling $38,500 to Edward and Mary - the remainder of the $40,000 selling price. Mary recognizes him as the man who dropped off the sack. As they fret over whether they should burn the checks, they find a note from the stranger explaining that he thought all 19 model couples would fall to temptation; since Edward and Mary have remained honest, he is giving them all the money. A second message arrives from Burgess, explaining that he intentionally kept the Richardses' claim from being read as a way to return an old favor Edward had done for him. The buyer has the fake gold coins stamped with a message mocking his political rival and distributes them throughout the town, allowing him to win an election for a seat in the state legislature. Edward and Mary become distraught over their situation, growing paranoid and starting to think Burgess has revealed their dishonesty to other people in the town. Their anxiety causes them both to fall ill, and Edward confesses their guilt shortly before he and Mary die. The checks are never cashed. With its reputation irreparably damaged, Hadleyburg decides to rename itself and remove one word from its official motto (originally \\"Lead Us Not Into Temptation\\"). The story ends with the comment, \\"It is an honest town once more, and the man will have to rise early that catches it napping again.\\" Adaptations The story was adapted into a 39-minute television film as part of the PBS American Short Stories series, directed by Ralph Rosenblum and featuring performances by Robert Preston, Fred Gwynne, and Frances Sternhagen. It first aired on March 17, 1980. The ending is both altered and shortened for the film. A DVD version was released by Monterey Media on November 16, 2004. Another adaptation of the story, featuring the Persky Ridge Players and filmed at a theater in Glasgow, Montana, had a VHS release on October 2, 2000.

After a two-year tour of China, the company is set to perform the piece around Europe in 2019.https://thesmalltown.eu/  Oberlin connection  Twain had given a lecture in a church at Oberlin College in 1885, and it was unpopular with the academic audience. The Hadleyburg story may allude to this event. Scholar Russel B. Nye wrote that the story \\"was Twain's way of taking revenge on the small town\\" after being jeered at and rejected by the academic audience. Writes Nye, \\"the story is coexistent with the publication of Twain's tale of exposed hypocrisy, the townspeople remembering his visit and noting the parallel situations. There are some interesting and provocative parallels between Twain's Oberlin experiences and the Hadleyburg of fiction\\". The town of Oberlin had been founded as a religious and educational settlement in 1833, and is and was known as an educational and religious center. Nye says that Twain read three stories that were received coolly by most of his Oberlin audience: \\"King Solomon\\" (an excerpt from Huckleberry Finn, ch. 14); \\"The Tragic Tale of a Fishwife,\\" an excerpt from A Tramp Abroad; and \\"A Trying Situation.\\" The fishwife tale is from Appendix D in A Tramp Abroad, subtitled \\"The Awful German Language.\\"  Vienna connection  Twain lived in Austria from 1897 to 1899.

It was built in the 18th century by the Order of Saint John, during the reign of Grand Master Ant√≥nio Manoel de Vilhena, after whom it is named. Fort Manoel is located to the north west of Valletta, and commands Marsamxett Harbour and the anchorage of Sliema Creek. The fort is an example of Baroque architecture, and it was designed with both functionality and aesthetics in mind. After a brief French occupation which began in 1798, the British military took over the fort in 1800, when it became known as HMS Phoenicia, and it remained in use by them until 1964. The fort was severely damaged in World War II, but it was restored in the early 21st century and it is now in good condition. Fort Manoel has been on Malta's tentative list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites since 1998, as part of the Knights' Fortifications around the Harbours of Malta. History =Background and failed proposals= Etching showing Marsamxett Harbour in the 1720s, just before the construction of Fort Manoel. The Isolotto (Manoel Island) is the island in the foreground, in the middle of the harbour. In the 16th century, the Marsamxett Harbour was one of the two major harbours in the Maltese city of Valletta. In the centre of the harbour was an island, originally known as l'Isolotto and now known as Manoel Island after the fort, which overlooked the city. Shortly after Valletta's construction, the Order of Saint John realised this was a potential vulnerability in the city's defences. As early as 1569, it was proposed that a small fort with a cavalier be built on the Isolotto to prevent the enemy from taking the island and building batteries on it. This proposal was presented by Francesco Collignon.http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/Melita%20Historica/MH.06(1972-75)/MH.6(1972)2/orig03.pdf The threat was again highlighted by the Spanish military engineer Scipione Campi in 1577, and by Giovanni Battista in 1582. The next proposal to build a fortification on the island was made by the Italian military engineer Antonio Maurizio Valperga in 1670. He proposed a roughly hexagonal fort with a hornwork, in the Dutch style of fortification. The proposal was criticized by the Order's engineers, and a third proposal was drawn up by the Flemish military engineer Carlos de Grunenbergh in 1687. Grunenburgh's proposal consisted of a fort with four bastions and a ravelin, surrounded by a ditch, covertway and faussebraye. Other proposals were made in 1715, this time by the knight Ren√© Jacob de Tign√© and a team of French engineers. There were several different plans, including building a coastal battery and a redoubt. Other plans included building a four-bastioned fort, or combining all three (fort, battery and redoubt) for the defence of the island. =Construction= Eventually, the final design was agreed in 1723, and it incorporated the work of de Tign√© as well as Charles Fran√ßois de Mondion, the Order's military engineer. The new fort was to be square in shape, with four bastions and two cavaliers. The fort was financed by, and named after, the Portuguese Grand Master, Ant√≥nio Manoel de Vilhena. He also set up the Manoel Foundation, a fund responsible for the maintenance and garrison of Fort Manoel and its outworks. The first stone was laid by de Vilhena on 14 September 1723, and work progressed rapidly. By 1727, the enceinte, cavaliers and gateway were complete. The ditch had been excavated by 1732, while the chapel, barracks, magazines and countermines were completed in around 1733. The fort was an active military establishment by 1734. When Mondion died in 1733, he was buried in the crypt under the fort's chapel. In 1757, Lembi Battery was added near Tign√© Point, Sliema. The battery was funded by the Manoel Foundation and it was considered to be an outwork of Fort Manoel, since it was intended to prevent an enemy from bombarding the fort's northern flank. It was decommissioned following the construction of Fort Tign√© in 1795. The construction of the latter fort was also partially funded by the Manoel Foundation. By 1761, Fort Manoel was considered to be as one of the best completed fortifications, and Comte de Bourlamaque has commented that the fort is a \\"mod√®le de fortification fait avec soin.\\" =French occupation= St. Michael's Bastion in Valletta The fort first saw use during the French invasion of Malta in June 1798, in the French Revolutionary Wars. At the time, it was commanded by the Portuguese knight Gourgeau, and it was garrisoned by the Cacciatori, who were a volunteer chasseur light infantry regiment, as well as a few men from the Birchircara militia. The fort surrendered after Grand Master Hompesch officially capitulated to Napoleon. A French garrison of a few hundred men took over the fort on 12 June. During the subsequent Maltese uprising and insurrection against the French, Maltese insurgents built Gƒßargƒßar and Sqaq Cappara batteries to bombard Fort Manoel. The Maltese attacked the fort on a number of occasions, and the French retaliated with their own bombardment at least once. On 12 September 1799, a company of French troops from Fort Manoel attempted to silence an insurgent gun position in San ƒ†wann, but were repelled by the Maltese insurgents. =British rule= World War II reenactment at Fort Manoel When Malta became a British protectorate in 1800, Fort Manoel was officially taken over by the British military that September. The piazza of Fort Manoel was the subject of the earliest known photographs of Malta, which were taken in 1840 by Horace Vernet while he was quarantined at the Lazzaretto but are now believed to be lost. In the late 19th century, the echaugettes on the bastions facing Valletta were dismantled to make way for gun emplacements. Later on, significant alterations were made to St. Anthony Bastion, when its gunpowder magazine was demolished to make way for a battery of three QF 12-pounder guns. The British military finally decommissioned the fort's guns in 1906, although it remained a military establishment. It was included on the Antiquities List of 1925. The fort saw use again during World War II, when a battery of 3.7-inch heavy anti-aircraft guns was deployed there. The guns were mounted in concrete gun emplacements and deployed in a semicircle in and around the fort. The fort suffered considerable damage to its ramparts, barracks and chapel as a result of aerial bombing during the war. The fort was eventually decommissioned in 1964. =Recent history= After being decommissioned, Fort Manoel was abandoned and fell into a state of disrepair. Parts of it were also vandalized. In 1970, the Royal Malta Yacht Club acquired part of the fort as its club house, and the yacht club remained there until it acquired new premises in Ta' Xbiex in 2008. In August 2001, the development company MIDI plc began restoration work on the fort. Phase One of the project, which included the restoration of the piazza and the reconstruction of the ruined chapel, was completed in 2009. The second phase, including the restoration of the outer fortifications and glacis, was approved by the Malta Environment and Planning Authority in 2012. The restoration of Fort Manoel together with that of the nearby Fort Tign√© cost a total of ‚Ç¨30 million. Layout The piazza and chapel of Fort Manoel after restoration Monument to Grand Master de Vilhena that was formerly located at Fort Manoel. It is now located at Misraƒß Papa Gwanni XXIII in Floriana. Fort Manoel is built in the shape of a square, with a pentagonal bastion on each corner, giving it the shape of a star fort. The four bastions are called St. Helen, St. Anthony, St. John and Notre Dame Bastions. St. Helen and St. Anthony Bastions are located on the seaward side, facing Valletta. They originally had echaugettes and gunpowder magazines, but the echaugettes on both bastions were dismantled in the 19th century, and the magazine on St. Anthony Bastion was demolished to make way for three QF 12-pounder gun emplacements. The magazine on St. Helen Bastion is still intact. The curtain wall linking these two bastions contains the main gate, which is protected by a lunette known as the Couvre Porte. St. John and Notre Dame Bastions are located along the landward side of the fort. Each bastion is protected by a low cavalier. The curtain wall between the two bastions is further protected by a pentagonal ravelin, which is largely rock hewn. A Piazza is located inside the fort, and it contains the rebuilt Chapel of St Anthony of Padua, several barrack blocks, an armoury and other buildings. A bronze statue of Grand Master Vilhena, possibly designed by Pietro Paolo Troisi, once stood in the square but it was removed in the 19th century and relocated to Valletta. It was later relocated again and it is now in Floriana. Ghost story The fort is supposedly haunted by the Black Knight, who wears the armour and regalia of the Order of St. John, and resembles Grand Master de Vilhena. In the 1940s, the knight began to appear out of thin air near the ruins of the Chapel of St Anthony of Padua, which had just been bombed in World War II. The apparition was reportedly seen by Maltese and English men within the fort. When the rubble from the ruined chapel began to be cleared, the workmen reported that the knight was supervising their work. When the crypt beneath the chapel was opened, it was found that it had been vandalized, and the remains of knights which had been buried there were scattered around. After the crypt was restored and the bones were reburied, the Black Knight stopped appearing. In 1980, the crypt was vandalized for a second time, and the Black Knight reportedly began to appear again.

It is traditionally served cold but it can be eaten hot. Origin Recipes for soup made of pureed leeks and potatoes were common by the 19th century in France. In 19th-century cookbooks, and still today, they are often named \\"Potage Parmentier\\" or \\"Potage √† la Parmentier\\" after Antoine-Augustin Parmentier, the French nutritionist and scholar who popularized the use of potatoes in France in the 18th Century. The French military cookbook of 1938 includes a recipe for \\"Potage Parmentier for 100 men\\" using milk instead of cream but with proportions and directions that are similar to the recipe for \\"Vichyssoise Soup\\" given later by Julia Child. The origins of the name Vichyssoise are a subject of debate among culinary historians; one version of the story is that Louis XV of France was afraid of being poisoned and had so many servants taste the potato leek soup that, by the time he tried it, the soup was cold, and since he enjoyed it that way it became a cold soup. Julia Child called it \\"an American invention\\", whereas others observe that \\"the origin of the soup is questionable in whether it's genuinely French or an American creation\\".

The book's message has been condemned by Japanese American groups and civil rights advocates. Its point of view has been criticized by academics.

Response to In Defense of Internment There was considerable media interest in the book especially on the American West Coast and Hawaii, where the impact of relocation and internment in World War II was greatest. It made the New York Times Best Seller list in September 2004.

The Conservative Book Club said Malkin provided \\"a largely fair assessment\\".In Defense of Internemt John Tateishi, the Executive Director of the Japanese American Citizens League issued a media release on August 24, 2004, calling the book \\"a desperate attempt to impugn the loyalty of Japanese Americans during World War II to justify harsher governmental policies today in the treatment of Arab and Muslim Americans.\\" Fred Korematsu, the plaintiff in the Supreme Court case Korematsu v.

'Overwash' may refer only to the landward flux of water due to overtopping of a dune system while 'washover' may refer to the sediment deposited by overwash. A common process on barrier islands, Overwash redistributes sediment and facilitates the migration of barrier islands in response to sea level rise. Overwash can occur as a result of runup (the maximum height of the swash), or inundation. Deposition from overwash (washover) can be deposited onto the beach berm, the dune, or as far as the back barrier bay, marsh, estuary, or lagoon. Sediment deposits created during overwash exhibit consistent scaling ‚Äî for example, the distance inland that an overwash deposit extends is proportional to the area that the overwash deposit covers. The distance inland that an overwash deposit extends is also correlated with the volume of sand deposited. The amount of overwash and washover sedimentation also depends on the characteristics of the storm and the setting ‚Äî coastal development tends to reduce in the amount of sand deposited on a barrier island during overwash, with consequences for barrier island evolution. The stratigraphic layers of sediment in an overwash deposit can be used to estimate the length of the storm that caused the deposition. Sediment deposited via overwash can also impact the rate of growth of salt marsh plants ‚Äî a small amount of sand deposited can increase salt marsh plant growth, but too much deposited sand will kill vegetation. During large storms, overwash deposits can self-organize into a periodic, rhythmic pattern, where overwash deposits occur at a regular spacing along the shoreline.

Its typical habitats are shrubby and herbaceous steppe, grassy steppes and rocky plateaus with shrubs and bunchgrass. Ecology The ecology of this burrowing mouse has been little studied. It mostly feeds on insects but may also consume seeds. One specimen was found inside the burrow of a Haig's tuco-tuco (Ctenomys haigi). Before 1998, only eight localities across Patagonia were known. More recently, as a result of more-intensive surveys, over fifty localities have been identified, some by finding the remains of mice in owl pellets. Conservation status Edwards' long-clawed mouse has a wide range and is present in several protected areas. It is common in some places and uncommon in others, and is assumed to have a large total population. No particular threats have been identified and the population appears to be steady, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being of \\"least concern\\".

(See External Links below). Character = Chip off the Old Block = Faridi is the only son of Nawab Azeezuddin Khan. His father is an aristocrat, famous for his adventurous nature. Faridi is often regarded as a copy of his father in looks and instincts. Safi had mentioned several of Nawab Sahab's friends who come in contact with Faridi. Little detail is given on the rest of Faridi's family. =Rectitude of character= The main attraction in his face is his eyes. He appears to be a sleepy, lazy, careless businessman (refer to Zameen Ke Badal ‚Äì ÿ≤ŸÖ€åŸÜ ⁄©€í ÿ®ÿßÿØŸÑ). However, those eyes are very deceiving. Behind them is the most alert mind of the century. Few people are able to talk to him while looking into his eyes. Faridi's character has a multitude of inspiring qualities. He's a man of principles. He believes in leading life by strict rules, controlled emotions, and objectivity. His abstinence from drugs, non-conjugal sex, and uncontrolled desires shows his strong character. He emotionally remains unmoved in respect to the fairer sex. Other strong traits include respect of law, nationalism, observation, common sense, and optimism. He is strong and powerful like a lion, but is as swift as lightning. Because of his composed, impassive and subdued emotional nature, Hameed, his closest partner and assistant, dubs him as \\"Father Hardstone\\". =Matters of heart= Colonel Hardstone was once seriously involved with Nawab Rasheeduz Zaman's daughter Ghazala. The romance did not last long. Faridi never liked talking about his affair with Ghizala and always kept his emotions contained. Soon, he realised that his life could not afford to have a strong emotion such as love, which could eventually become his greatest weakness in solving mysteries and catching culprits. The fact that he does not choose to fall in love with a member of the opposite sex does not mean that he cannot love or is not affected by it. Rajkumari Tara in Zahreela Admi (ÿ≤€Åÿ±€åŸÑÿß ÿ¢ÿØŸÖ€å) was one of the unfortunate girls who lost her life for Faridi. The account of her devastating destruction left Faridi trembling and astounded. =Peculiar hobbies= Faridi is also unique in selecting hobbies. His major interests include reading and domesticating dogs and snakes. Science, specifically chemistry projects, is another diversion that he indulges in during his spare time. He seems to know several languages and is found reading books in different languages, including German. Many breeds of dogs can be found in his enormous doghouse. He seems to possess some famous species of dogs, such as the African Yellow Dingo, German Shepherd, Greyhound, Bloodhound, etc. He takes the same approach with pet snakes. Black mamba and Indian cobra are some of the more dangerous kinds that he can handle with ease due to his training with the reptiles. One of the most distinguished arts that he has mastered is to incapacitate snakes by grabbing them by the tail and jolting them. =Residence= Faridi lives in a lavish mansion of gigantic proportion. His residence encompasses a backyard of several acres. Many rooms including bedrooms, living room, dining room, library, laboratory, museum, and servant quarters have been mentioned in his novels specifically. A front porch for parking and a huge garage for his cars is also part of the same residence. His mansion also has secret underground cellars. =Automobiles= Faridi drives models of several state-of-art auto brands of their time, namely Cadillac, Lincoln, and Austin Mini (a British Leyland car). In addition to his regular means of conveyance, Faridi's garage carries several vehicles for different occasions. For example, in Jungle Ki Aag (ÿ¨ŸÜ⁄ØŸÑ ⁄©€å ÿ¢⁄Ø), Faridi preps up a Jeep with machine guns and other arms. On several occasions, he repaints one of his many Fiats for concealment before going on a specific mission. Faridi also owns a boat that was used once or twice to chase down criminals. =From Inspector to \\"Colonel\\"= The title \\"Colonel\\" is honorary, much-awaited title that he reluctantly accepted after he caught a very contemptible character, Gerald Shastri, in Maut Ki Chataan (ŸÖŸàÿ™ ⁄©€å ⁄ÜŸπÿßŸÜ). Hameed also received his honorary \\"Captain\\" title at the same time. Faridi also possesses a \\"special permission\\" from the President to interfere in any matter that required his attention. Many of his colleagues and even senior officers envy him because of the endowments that he receives either by inheritance or by travail. =Wealth= Colonel Faridi's wealth is \\"inconceivable\\". The reader slowly realises Faridi's great wealth, an aspect of his character that makes him so mystical. From owning expensive vehicles, Ibne-Safi eventually takes Faridi to a level that is just unprecedented ‚Äì an owner of an independent state as referred in Zahreela Admi (ÿ≤€Åÿ±€åŸÑÿß ÿ¢ÿØŸÖ€å) and Bechara/bechari (ÿ®€å⁄Üÿßÿ±€Å/ÿ®€å⁄Üÿßÿ±€å). = Black Force organisation = Faridi is also the head of a secret crime-fighting organisation called the \\"Black Force\\". As opposed to other superheroes, most members of his team know who their boss is. They usually refer to Faridi as Colonel Hardstone. On the other hand, members of Black Force usually hide their identity so much so that even Hameed gets irritated by it since he thinks he is the closest companion of \\"Father Hardstone\\". Black Force is also an international organisation and its members are found all over the world. These members are usually recognised by code names such as B11, B2, etc.  See also  * Ibn-e-Safi * Jasoosi Dunya * Sajid Hameed * Faridi's Unofficial Aide * Villains of Jasoosi Dunya * Complete List of Jasoosi Dunya (Old) * Complete List of Jasoosi Dunya (New)  References   External links  * The official Ibne-Safi website Category:Fictional secret agents and spies Category:Ibn-e-Safi Category:Jasoosi Dunya Category:Fictional Pakistani people ","title":"Ahmad Kamal Faridi"},{"id":"2441067","text":"Arensburg may refer to: * German name of Kuressaare, a town and a municipality on Saaremaa island in Estonia ** Schutzmannschaft Front Bataillon 36 Arensburg * Baruch Arensburg (born 1934, Santiago, Chile), anatomist See also * Ahrensburg, a town in the district of Stormarn, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany ","title":"Arensburg"},{"id":"2441069","text":"Orlow W.

Chisholm was born in India of Scottish parents, Ruari Ian Lambert Chisholm and Pamela Harland Frank, and brought up in Calcutta. Mairi Chisholm was his great-aunt. He was educated at Worth School, and later attended Cambridge University, reading Mechanical Sciences on a scholarship from General Motors. After completing his studies, he worked at GM from 1968 as a graduate apprentice before joining BP's computer consultancy firm Scicon in 1969. He joined leading systems house CAP and founded a divisional company within that group called CAP Scientific Ltd in 1979 of which he was managing director. In 1988, CAP merged with SEMA-METRA, a French company and the merged group was called Sema Group allowing it to trade in Europe where \\"CAP\\" was already used by an historical link with CAP-Gemini. SEMA-METRA was cash rich whereas CAP Group had a very strong order book. This allowed balancing of the new group's portfolio. In practice some would regard the move as a reverse takeover due to the relative strength of the French component of the company. Chisholm was UK managing director of Sema Group plc. In 1991, Chisholm was asked by the UK Ministry of Defence to organize a number of their research organisations into a single entity, which eventually became the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA) - the largest science and technology organisation in the UK. In July 2001, three quarters of DERA was spun off to form a new private company called QinetiQ. In late 2005 Chisholm became Executive Chairman of QinetiQ, being replaced as CEO by Graham Love. According to The Sunday Times his annual pay was ¬£467,000 in 2004. His ¬£129,000 investment in the company was later worth ¬£23m (a 17,829.5% return on investment, almost 180 times the initial value of the investment, which led to suggestions the company was undervalued). In 2008, the chairman of the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee accused Chisholm of \\"profiteering at the expense of the taxpayer\\". In response, Chisholm stated that the criticisms were ‚Äúgrossly unfair‚Äù, and that \\"the reshaping of QinetiQ had been the greatest achievement of my working life‚Äù. At that time, his stake was worth just over ¬£21m.Times Online feb 8 2009 Chisholm has been President of the Electrical Engineering Association. He was President and Trustee of the Institution of Engineering & Technology (formerly Institution of Electrical Engineers) (2005‚Äì2006). He was knighted in 1999. Sir John is a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering, the Royal Aeronautical Society, the Institute of Physics. He holds honorary Doctor of Engineering degrees from the Universities of Bath, Southampton and Brunel. He was a founding member of the British Government's Technology Foresight programme. Appointed Chairman of the Medical Research Council by the Government, a position he took up in October 2006, he succeeded Sir Anthony Cleaver who had been in the post since 1998. Cleaver welcomed Chisholm's appointment stating him as a strong advocate for research. \\"Sir John's passion in promoting the value of research will be invaluable to the Medical Research Council as we enter a further period of change.\\" MRC News Release 8 May 2006 In 2007 the House of Commons Select Committee on Science and Technology, after describing him as vague and evasive in answering questions, said \\"we have serious reservations as to whether Sir John is the right person to guide the MRC Executive through the coming period of change\\". Despite his lack of medical qualifications, the Government refuted this statement saying that \\"Sir John has a first class background in business and has all the qualities and the perspective needed to chair the MRC Council successfully through this period of change...\\". The Government also stated in response to the report by House of Commons Select Committee on Science and Technology that \\"The MRC is entering a period of change as the Centre's role in developing research evidence to support decision making in policy and practice was highlighted in the Cooksey report recommendations are put into effect. The new Chairman's career record‚Äîin particular his experience in managing change and translating research into marketable products‚Äîindicates that he should be well suited to a non-executive Chairman's role at this stage in the MRC's evolution.\\" Sir John was appointed Chairman of NESTA (National Endowment for Science Technology and the Arts) on the first of November 2009.

He was born into a Baltic German family in Arensburg, Governorate of Livonia, and studied at the Imperial Academy of Arts in Saint Petersburg. As a natural son of Baron von Osten- Sacken, he received the name Osteneck, which he later chose to render into Russian as Vostokov (Ost, the German word for \\"east,\\" translates to vostok in Russian). He liked to experiment with language and, in one of his poems, introduced the female name Svetlana, which would gain popularity through Vasily Zhukovsky's eponymous ballad. During his lifetime, Vostokov was known as a poet and translator, but it is his innovative studies of versification and comparative Slavonic grammars which proved most influential. In 1815, he joined the staff of the Imperial Public Library, where he discovered the most ancient dated book written in Slavonic vernacular, the so-called Ostromir Gospel. In 1841, Vostokov was elected to the Russian Academy of Sciences. Vostokov's works on the Church Slavonic language were considered a high-water mark of Slavic studies until the appearance of Izmail Sreznevsky's comprehensive lexicon in 1893‚Äì1903 and garnered him the doctorates honoris causa from the Charles University and University of T√ºbingen. Vostokov also laid foundations of modern Russian toponymy. In 1812, he published an article with the title \\"An example to the amateurs of etymology\\" (), where he argued that geographical names (toponyms) have repeating elements which he called formants and which help to restore the etymology of the name. For instance, the endings -va, -ga, and -ma in the end of such names as the Sylva, the Onega, and the Kama, may mean \\"water\\" in the languages these names originate from. Whereas this article did not get sufficient attention during Vostokov's life, it did subsequently receive recognition, and Vostokov is cited as one of the founders of toponymy in Russia.

Reed Jr., Grover Norquist and Michael Scanlon on Native American tribes who were seeking to develop casino gambling on their reservations. The lobbyists charged the tribes an estimated $85 million in fees. Abramoff and Scanlon grossly overbilled their clients, secretly splitting the multi-million dollar profits. In one case, they secretly orchestrated lobbying against their own clients in order to force them to pay for lobbying services. In the course of the scheme, the lobbyists were accused of illegally giving gifts and making campaign donations to legislators in return for votes or support of legislation. Representative Bob Ney (R-OH) and two aides to Tom DeLay (R-TX) were directly implicated; other politicians had various ties. Guilty pleas Scanlon and Abramoff both pleaded guilty to a variety of criminal charges related to the scheme. On January 3, 2006, Abramoff pleaded guilty to three felony counts‚Äîconspiracy, fraud, and tax evasion‚Äîinvolving charges stemming principally from his lobbying activities in Washington on behalf of Native American tribes. In addition, Abramoff and other defendants must make restitution of at least $25 million that was defrauded from clients, most notably the Native American tribes. Abramoff owes the Internal Revenue Service $1.7 million as a result of his guilty plea to the tax evasion charge. The court filing is available as a PDF On May 8, 2006, Neil Volz, former chief of staff to Representative Bob Ney (R-Ohio), staff director of the House Administration Committee, and later part of Team Abramoff, pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy, including wire fraud and violating House rules, charges stemming from his work for both Ney and Greenberg Traurig. On March 23, 2007, J. Steven Griles, former Deputy Secretary of the U.S. Department of Interior, pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice in the Senate investigation of the Abramoff scandal. A political appointee, he was the top Bush administration official to plead guilty in the scandal. Investigations On November 25, 2005, the Wall Street Journal reported the expansion of the investigation to four members of Congress: in addition to Ney and DeLay, the report includes Rep. John Doolittle (R., Calif.) and Sen. Conrad Burns (R., Mont.) On December 2, 2005, the New York Times reported that federal prosecutors were considering a plea bargain arrangement that would give Abramoff some consideration if he provided evidence that would implicate members of Congress and their senior staffers in receiving job offers in return for legislative favors. The guilty pleas signed by Abramoff in early January 2006 state that he bribed public officials. One of the cases of bribery described in detail involves a person identified as \\"Representative #1,\\" who was reported by the Washington Post to be Representative Bob Ney (R-OH). Ney's spokesman confirmed that Ney was the representative identified, but denied any improper influence. The agreement also details Abramoff's practice of hiring former congressional staffers. Abramoff used these persons' influence to lobby their former Congressional employers, in violation of a one-year federal ban on such lobbying. After Abramoff's guilty plea, the federal government shifted its investigation in January 2006 to focus on the lobbying firm Alexander Strategy Group,alexanderstrategy.com founded by a \\"close friend of DeLay's and his former chief of staff.\\"U.S. lobbying inquiry shifts to a second firm - International Herald Tribune The lobbying firm announced its closure at the end of the same month due to \\"fatal publicity\\"; it had represented such large firms as Microsoft and PhRMA. On June 22, 2006 the U.S. Senate Committee on Indian Affairs released its final report on the scandal. The report states that under the guidance of the Mississippi Choctaw tribe's planner, Nell Rogers, the tribe agreed to launder money because \\"Ralph Reed did not want to be paid directly by a tribe with gaming interests.\\" It also states that Reed used non-profits, including Grover Norquist's Americans for Tax Reform, as pass-throughs to disguise the origin of the funds, and that \\"the structure was recommended by Jack Abramoff to accommodate Mr. Reed's political concerns.\\" ABC News reported on November 15, 2006, that Abramoff told prosecutors that Senator Harry Reid (D) requested contributions of $30,000 from the lobbyist's clients. After being paid, Reid agreed to assist Abramoff in matters concerning Indian casinos. In August 2010, the federal government ended a six- year investigation of DeLay's ties to Abramoff, according to Richard Cullen, DeLay's lead counsel in the matter. State prosecution continued in Texas, which ended in November 2010 with DeLay being found guilty of conspiracy and money laundering. In January 2011, he was sentenced to three years in state prison.McKinley, James Jr. \\"DeLay Sentenced to 3 Years in Conspiracy and Money-Laundering Case\\", The New York Times, 11 January 2011. Background =Mississippi Choctaw‚ÄîIntroduction to tribal lobbying= In the second half of the 1990s, Abramoff was employed by Preston Gates Ellis & Rouvelas Meeds LLP, the lobbying arm of Preston Gates & Ellis LLP law firm based in Seattle, Washington. In 1995, Abramoff began representing Native American tribes that were seeking to establish gambling on reservations, starting with the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians. The Choctaw originally had lobbied the federal government directly, but beginning in 1994, they found that many of the congressional members who had responded to their issues had either retired or were defeated in the \\"Republican Revolution\\" of the 1994 elections. Nell Rogers, the tribe's specialist on legislative affairs, had a friend who was familiar with Abramoff's father and Abramoff's work as a Republican activist. The tribe contacted Preston Gates, and soon after hired the firm and Abramoff. One of Abramoff's first actions was to defeat a Congressional bill that sought to use the unrelated business income tax (UBIT) to tax Native American casinos; it was sponsored by Reps. Bill Archer (R-TX) and Ernest Istook (R-OK). Since the matter involved taxation, Abramoff enlisted help from his college acquaintance, fellow Republican Grover Norquist, and his Americans for Tax Reform (ATR). The bill was eventually defeated in 1996 in the Senate, due in part to grassroots work by ATR, for which the Choctaw paid $60,000. According to Washington Business Forward, a lobbying trade magazine, \\"[Tom DeLay] was a major factor in those victories, and the fight helped cement the alliance between the two men.www.bizforward.com =Ralph Reed and Grover Norquist= Later in 1999, Abramoff enlisted the help of another Republican friend, Ralph Reed. The Choctaw needed to defeat a bill in the Alabama State Legislature that would allow casino-style games at dog racing tracks. This would have resulted in competition for their casino business. Reed had recently contacted Abramoff via email, looking for some help in establishing new business. Reed proposed to Abramoff some work which he and his firm, Century Strategies, could perform. Reed could access \\"3,000 pastors and 90,000 religious conservative households\\" in Alabama, as well as \\"the Alabama Christian Coalition, the Alabama Family Alliance, the Alabama Eagle Forum, [and] the Christian Family Association.\\" Reed wanted a $20,000 per month retainer for his services. On April 6, 1999, Abramoff got Preston Gates to approve hiring Reed as a subcontractor, and told Reed to \\"get me invoices as soon as possible so I can get Choctaw to get us checks asap.\\" By May 10, 1999, the Choctaw had paid $1.3 million to Reed via Preston Gates, for various grassroots activities relating to the dog-track bill, as well as opposing an Alabama state lottery. The tribe discontinued paying the money through Preston Gates when Abramoff suggested that they use Norquist's Americans for Tax Reform as a conduit, to which the tribe agreed. Although the anti-gambling effort was not related to ATR's anti-taxation activities, ATR passed checks of up to $300,000 from the Choctaw to Reed's firm, in one case taking $25,000 as a \\"management fee\\". Later in 1999, Abramoff used Reed's services again to oppose the federal Internet Gambling Prohibition Act, on behalf of eLottery, a corporate client. =\\"Team Abramoff\\"= At Greenberg Traurig, Abramoff assembled a \\"dream team\\" made up of men who had previously worked as staff for Congressional leaders. The team included Tony Rudy, with whom Abramoff had worked extensively during the Marianas and eLottery lobbying, while Rudy was serving as Chief of Staff to Tom DeLay. Abramoff had hired Rudy while he was still at Preston Gates & Ellis, and brought him and six other staff lobbyists over to Greenberg Traurig. The hiring of Rudy was one of the first instances in a pattern by which Abramoff would directly hire former aides of representatives whom he was actively lobbying. =2001 White House Transition Team Member= Because he was dealing with Native American tribes, Abramoff needed a contact in the Department of Interior, where the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) oversaw Indian affairs. His main contact in the office of Deputy Secretary of the Interior Steven Griles was Italia Federici, a former political aide to Secretary of the Interior Gale Norton. The lobbyist's main contact in the West Wing of the White House was his former aide Susan Ralston, who became the Executive Assistant to Karl Rove, then Senior Advisor to President George W. Bush. In 2007 Griles and Federici pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice in the Senate investigation of the Abramoff scandal; Griles on March 23 and Federici on June 8. \\"Gimme Five\\" begins Abramoff and Michael Scanlon appeared to begin their plan for fraud via an email exchange on June 18, 2001, as documented in \\"Gimme Five\\"‚ÄîInvestigation of Tribal Lobbying Matters, the final report of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs' investigation into Abramoff. After his career in the office of Congressman Tom Delay, Scanlon had briefly been a member of Team Abramoff. He set up his own public affairs consulting firm and contacted Abramoff. Scanlon described a plan by which Abramoff would help to build the client base of Scanlon's firm, Campaign Capitol Strategies, up to at least $3 million per year. At some point, Scanlon would use his contacts in the public affairs industry to get the firm acquired at a price of three times the revenue, and Scanlon and Abramoff would split the profits. This is considered by investigators to be the beginning of what Abramoff and Scanlon would refer to as \\"gimme five\\". =Louisiana Coushatta= In 2001, the Louisiana Coushatta tribe were going to renegotiate their gambling compact with the State of Louisiana. The tribe was interested in negotiating a 25-year compact with the state, but was expecting a \\"very vigorous fight\\" and were not certain that their current lobbying representatives were up to the challenge. Abramoff and Scanlon were well recommended to the tribe by a representative of the Chitimacha Tribe of Louisiana. Kathryn Van Hoof, the Coushatta's outside counsel, introduced the idea to the Tribal Council that having a high-powered Federal lobbyist could help also with any problems on the state level. =Abramoff and Scanlon make their pitch= A few weeks later, after collecting details of the Coushatta's lobbying needs from Van Hoof, Abramoff and Scanlon gave a presentation to the Tribal Council. Abramoff claimed that he could get appropriation earmarks for the tribe, and \\"get things passed through the legislature\\". Abramoff mentioned his and Scanlon's ties with Tom DeLay, and the fact that he \\"worked with people\\" in the Department of Interior. Abramoff also suggested that participating in a DeLay golf tournament and paying \\"lists of suggested contributions\\" would give the tribe name recognition and access to politicians. Scanlon claimed that his firm could organize direct mail, telephone, and media campaigns, as well as giving advice on strategies to gain the support of or neutralize the opposition of specific public officials. Scanlon also promised a customized database and \\"electronic-related services\\", based on polling and collection of information of individuals who could be \\"mobilized\\" in letter-writing campaigns and phone calls to officials. The Tribal Council was initially somewhat confused by the relationship between Abramoff and Scanlon; one member believed that Scanlon's company was a branch of Greenberg Traurig. However, the two men were hired and paid separately. Members of the tribe later claimed that Abramoff \\"never told the Council that he would personally collect a share of those proceeds that the tribe paid Scanlon.\\" The tribe agreed on March 20, 2001 to hire Abramoff at a relatively high retainer of $125,000 a month, plus expenses. On April 12, the tribe agreed to hire Scanlon's firm for $534,500 for initial work on the compact renegotiation. In July 2001, Louisiana Governor Mike Foster approved the new gambling compact. The tribe later claimed that there was evidence that Scanlon's proposed strategies were implemented. Abramoff and Scanlon proposed a much larger scope of work to the tribe. =Texas Menace= The Ysleta del Sur Pueblo, or \\"Tigua tribe\\" opened its Speaking Rock Casino near El Paso, Texas in 1993. In 1999 the State of Texas sought to have the casino closed based on its interpretation of the Tribal Restoration Act, which had granted the tribe Federal recognition. The act stated that \\"[all] gaming activities which are prohibited by the laws of the State of Texas are hereby prohibited on the reservation and on lands of the tribe.\\" The State of Texas interpreted this provision as allowing state law to preempt the tribe's ability to operate a casino. Future senator John Cornyn led the court challenge as the Texas Attorney General. The State of Texas succeeded in closing the casino in 2002. In October 2001, Abramoff suggested to the Louisiana Coushatta that the Texas legislature was \\"one vote away\\" from legalizing certain forms of gambling in Texas. The Alabama Coushatta, a related but competing tribe, was also seeking to open a casino in eastern Texas in 2001. Abramoff told the Louisiana Coushatta that if the Tigua succeeded in their court case, Texas would be forced to allow the Alabama Coushatta to open a casino in the state. As the Louisiana Coushatta attracted many customers from eastern Texas to their casino, a Texas-based Native American casino could pose a grave threat to their livelihood. Scanlon suggested forming a \\"Grassroots Political Structure\\" in Texas to oppose the Tigua's effort to have gambling approved on their land.Oversight Hearing Regarding Tribal Lobbying Matters, et al, November 2, 2005, Washington, DC, Part 2 Abramoff and Scanlon succeeded in negotiating nearly $4 million in additional fees for a \\"Louisiana Program\\". Although the fees were purportedly to support grassroots activities, Scanlon insisted that $1 million be paid directly to Greenberg Traurig. He said, \\"we plan to do some things through the law firm umbrella due to their highly sensitive nature and confidentiality reasons. I hate hiding behind lawyers‚Äîbut we are going to do some crazy stuff on this one‚Äîso I guess it's ok.\\" In fact, the day before Abramoff had directed Scanlon by email to run some of the fees money directly through his firm: \\"I want to see if we can pump up our LDA [reporting requirements under the Lobbying Disclosure Act] for the second half to make sure we don't fall out of the top ten [lobbying firms]. I can achieve this if I can run some of the money for the Coushattas through the firm and then get it to CCS.\\" Abramoff deceived both the Coushatta and Greenberg Traurig by having the money redirected as a donation to the Capital Athletic Foundation. Abramoff and Scanlon suggested to the Coushatta that they ought to support Christian evangelical conservatives, as they were expected to oppose gaming expansion in Texas. Abramoff specifically suggested the tribe work with Republican Ralph Reed but, according to a tribal leader, he warned that \\"it can't get out ... It wouldn't look good if they're receiving money from a casino-operating tribe to oppose gaming. It would be kind of like hypocritical.\\" The tribe paid Reed via Southern Underwriters, a Louisiana insurance company, which made payments to American International Center, a shell corporation controlled by Scanlon. Scanlon and Abramoff skimmed millions of dollars for themselves from fees paid through this method. Reed worked with Houston pastors and church congregations to demand that the state government prevent the Tigua casinos from opening. Reed also claimed to work directly with John Cornyn; in a November 15 email, Abramoff claimed \\"Ralph and I spoke last night. Cornyn is supposed to call Ralph as soon as he can make it to a phone after El Paso.\\" However, in a Meet the Press interviews on January 8, 2006, Senator Cornyn denied any direct connection to the lobbyists. In addition to working on grassroots efforts, Abramoff claimed that he had also influenced the Lieutenant Governor of Texas, Bill Ratcliff, to prevent a bill to allow the Tigua to open their casino from being scheduled for a vote in the State Senate. The opposition efforts succeeded, and the Tigua officially closed their casino on February 12, 2002. =\\"Saving\\" the Tigua= As the Tigua casino was being closed, Abramoff was trying to contact the Tigua tribe. He reached the Tigua's public relations representative Marc Schwartz on February 6, 2002, and met with the tribal council on February 12. According to Schwartz, Abramoff \\"expressed indignation\\" over what had happened to the tribe and said that he wanted to \\"right the terrible injustice that had been brought upon the tribe.\\" During the meeting, Abramoff admitted that he was friends with Ralph Reed, who had publicly called for the closing of the casino, but claimed that Reed was \\"crazy, like other folks in the Christian Coalition\\". He said that Reed was supplying information about the anti-gambling effort to Abramoff, so he knew their strategy. He also admitted that the Louisiana Coushatta were also his client, but claimed that the Coushatta did not have a problem with the Tigua pursuing a casino. Abramoff proposed that he and Greenberg Traurig would represent the tribe pro bono until the casino was re- opened. But, he said they would have to pay \\"a lot\\" for Scanlon's services. The strategy, later called \\"Operation Open Doors\\", would cost more than $5 million. He proposed getting a friendly lawmaker to sneak a provision or rider into a federal bill that would permit the Tigua to reopen their casino, and said that it would require the tribe to make contributions to the lawmakers. Abramoff mentioned Scanlon's past career in the office of Tom DeLay, and Scanlon said that he \\"had an ongoing relationship with Congressman DeLay.\\" During his presentation, Abramoff gave the tribe a list of contributions to legislators, which he said were required, and advised the tribe to make these immediately. Once the provision was made law, opponents would try to repeal it. The second part of Abramoff's strategy was for Scanlon to create a nationwide database of grassroots supporters who could be called on to send letters and make phone calls to representatives to block any repeal. The Tigua agreed to the proposal on the condition that it cost no more than $4.2 million, and signed the contract on March 5, 2002. Guilty plea‚Äîconfirmed corrupt lobbying practices taking the fifth\\". Abramoff and his partner Scanlon are alleged to have engaged in a series of corrupt practices in connection to their lobbying work for various Indian gaming tribes. The fees paid to Abramoff and Scanlon for this work are believed to exceed $85 million. In particular, Abramoff and Scanlon were alleged to have conspired with Washington power broker Grover Norquist and Christian activist Ralph Reed to coordinate lobbying against his own clients and prospective clients with the objective of forcing them to engage Abramoff and Scanlon to lobby against their own covert operations. Reed was paid to campaign against gambling interests that competed with Abramoff clients. Norquist served as a go-between by funneling money to Reed. =Allegations of double dealing= On June 22, 2000, Susan Ralston e-mailed Abramoff, \\"I have 3 checks from elot: (1) 2 checks for $80K payable to ATR and (2) 1 check to TVC for $25K,\\" ... \\"Let me know exactly what to do next. Send to Grover? Send to Rev. Lou?\\" This email documented that eLottery money went through Norquist's foundation, Americans for Tax Reform (ATR), the Faith and Family Alliance, and Reed's company, Century Strategies. The last check was sent to Sheldon's Traditional Values Coalition (TVC). In 2000, Abramoff forced the Choctaw to give the Alabama Christian Coalition of America $1.15 million in installments. Norquist agreed to pass the money on to the Coalition and another Alabama anti-gambling group, both of which Reed was mobilizing for the fight against a proposed Alabama state lottery. In 2002, after Abramoff worked with Reed to close the casino of the Tigua tribe, he persuaded the tribe to hire him to lobby Congress to reopen the casino. Of the $7.7 million Abramoff and Scanlon charged the Choctaw for projects in 2001, they spent $1.2 million on the tribe's behalf and split the rest in a scheme they called \\"gimme five.\\" =Guilty plea‚Äîconfirmed spending irregularities= In 2004, Abramoff resigned from Greenberg Traurig amid a scandal related to spending irregularities in his work as a lobbyist for Native American tribes involved in gambling, namely The Mississippi Choctaw, the Louisiana Coushatta, the Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians, Sandia Pueblo, the Saginaw Chippewa and the Tigua of Ysleta del Sur Pueblo. The Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians paid $15 million to Abramoff and Scanlon's organizations. The bills were heavily padded. For example, in April 2000 he padded 2 hours with over 60 hours to achieve a \\"$150k minimum.\\" The funds were diverted to a number of projects, including the Eshkol Academy, an all-boys Orthodox Jewish school set up by Abramoff in Maryland. =American International Center= Part of the sums paid by the tribes for lobbying were paid to the American International Center, a purported think tank headed by David Grosh. In fact, he was a lifeguard on the Delaware shore who \\"operated\\" the organization from his beach house. Grosh had no qualifications or experience relevant to policy research and, at the time of the Congressional investigation, was working in construction. At a Senate hearing, Grosh admitted that he had abetted the deception and said that he was \\"embarrassed and disgusted to be a part of this whole thing.\\" =Derogatory references to Native American clients= In emails now made public by the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, which is investigating his activities, Abramoff repeatedly referred to Native Americans as \\"monkeys,\\" \\"troglodites,\\" and \\"morons.\\" Abramoff once asked his co-conspirator Scanlon to meet a client, saying in an email, \\"I have to meet with the monkeys from the Choctaw tribal council. You need to close the deal ... with the client ...\\" In another email message he wrote, \\"we need to get some money from those monkeys!!\\" About one tribal client Abramoff wrote to Scanlon (date unknown), Abramoff's monetary influence Abramoff spent millions of dollars to influence and entertain Republican politicians. Abramoff had a reputation for largesse considered exceptional even by Washington standards. In addition to offering many Republican members of Congress expensive free meals at his restaurant, Signatures, Abramoff maintained four skyboxes at major sports arenas for political entertaining, at a cost of more than $1 million a year. Abramoff hosted many fundraisers at these skyboxes, including events for Republican politicians publicly opposed to gambling, such as John Doolittle. \\"The lies of lobbygate\\", Rutland Herald Online Abramoff gave over $260,000 in personal contributions to Republican candidates, politicians, and organizations, and funded numerous trips for politicians and staffers, including both Republicans and Democrats. An estimated two thirds of Ambramoff's direct contributions went to Republican congressmen, and one third to Democratic congressional leaders. Of the approximately $85 million in tribal money entrusted to Abramoff, his employers, or his related organizations, over $4.4 million since 1999 were directed to at least 250 members of Congress, primarily Republicans in leadership positions or on relevant committees, and Democrats with standing connections to Native American interests, such as Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) (in a 2-1 GOP ratio). These contributions have since become tainted by their association with Abramoff's criminal behavior.\\"Coming to the Hill: lots of hearing-room drama\\", Christian Science Monitor Some of those who received money from Abramoff or his clients have either returned the money or donated it. For example, months after the investigations began, on December 14, 2005, the Washington Post reported that Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND), the vice-chairman for the US Senate Indian Affairs Committee, had announced he would return $67,000 in contributions from Indian tribes represented by Abramoff. Others, such as Representative John Doolittle (R-CA), have refused to do so.Erica Werner, \\"Ties to ex-lobbyist Abramoff haunt NorCal Rep. Doolittle\\" , Associated Press, January 12, 2006 Rep. J.D. Hayworth (R-AZ), co- chairman of the Congressional Native American Caucus, received more than $150,000 from Indian tribes once represented by Abramoff. He was the largest single recipient of Abramoff-related money. Hayworth said he would keep the donations because they were given independently of Abramoff's influence. He donated to charity $2,250 which was paid directly by Abramoff. Other connected parties =The Bush Administration= US GSA Chief Procurement Officer David Hossein Safavian On September 19, 2005, David Safavian, who was serving as the head of the federal procurement policy at the Office of Management and Budget, was the first person arrested in the Abramoff scandal. Safavian was charged with lying to investigators and obstructing the federal inquiry of Abramoff.The Raw Story  Bush Management and Budget Procurement chief arrested after quitting Safavian knew Abramoff from the three years, 1995‚Äì1997, when he was part of Abramoff's lobbying team at Preston Gates & Ellis. Deputy United States Secretary of the Interior J. Steven Griles Abramoff claimed in emails sent in 2002 that Deputy United States Secretary of the Interior Griles had pledged to block an Indian casino that would compete with one of his clients. Abramoff later told two people that he was trying to hire Griles. Mr. Griles pled guilty to a felony charge of lying to the Senate Indian Affairs Committee about his ties to Jack Abramoff. In March 2007, he was sentenced to a five-month jail term and another five months in a halfway house or home confinement.  March 23, 2007  Ex-Deputy of Interior Dept. Pleads Guilty  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS  Campaign contributions from Abramoff and his clients Abramoff also personally donated $14,000 over the period 1999-2004 to the congressional campaign of Representative John Doolittle (R-CA) According to the Washington Post, Doolittle \\"was particularly close to Abramoff.\\" Doolittle said he always thought of Abramoff as \\"a friend\\" for a single reason: \\"I liked him, frankly, because he was a partisan, conservative Republican activist.\\"War Room - Salon.com Unlike many lawmakers, Doolittle has refused to give away or return any of the Abramoff money. Fund raising by Abramoff for Doolittle An \\"ardent opponent of casino gambling,\\" Doolittle held a fundraiser at Jack Abramoff's skybox at the MCI Center in February 1999. Abramoff, who rented the boxes himself, billed Indian tribes lobbying fees to cover his cost. These tribes had hired Abramoff to represent their casino interests. Under federal campaign finance law, Doolittle was required to pay Abramoff for use of the box, or to report the use as an \\"in-kind\\" contribution from Abramoff to his campaign. Doolittle initially failed to report the use of the sky-boxes in his Federal Election Committee filings. In late 2004, his spokesperson, Laura Blackman, said \\"It was an in-kind contribution, and it was an oversight that it wasn't reported, but we are taking steps to correct that.\\" In January 2005, Doolittle reported that his campaign fund had sent a check for $1,040 to one of Abramoff's former employers, the Preston Gates lobbying firm, to pay for the skybox. The lobbying firm returned the check because it had never owned the skybox. In May 2005, Doolittle campaign-fund spokesman Richard Robinson acknowledged that the rejection of the check should have been reported to the FEC and said a corrected accounting would be filed. Robinson said Doolittle's fund is determined to rectify the six-year lapse in paying for the box. \\"If we find out that Jack Abramoff paid for the suite, then we'll reimburse Jack Abramoff, because we want to reimburse the person or entity who paid for the box,\\" Robinson said. \\"We thought we were doing that in January.\\"Jon Kamman, \\"Hayworth, 2 others account for skyboxes: New filings omit links to lobbyist\\" , Arizona Republic, May 10, 2005 Payments to Doolittle's wife by Abramoff From August 2002 through February 2004, Abramoff's lobbying firm, Greenberg Traurig paid Julie Doolittle $66,000. Initially her work was to help plan a fundraiser for Abramoff's Capital Athletic Foundation, called the Spy Game Gala, which was to be MC'ed by Tony Snow. The event never happened because it coincided with the beginning of the 2003 invasion of Iraq in March 2003. According to the initial statement by her attorney, the $66,000 in payments from Abramoff were because she \\"primarily performed public relations and other event planning services for the Spy Museum event.\\" She was paid a total of $27,000 through February 2003, when payments stopped. In July 2003, Abramoff (via Greenberg Traurig) began paying her again, at the rate of $5,000 per month. This continued through mid-February 2004, when the first story on what would become the Abramoff scandal was published. In a statement in June 2006, her attorney, William Stauffer, said that \\"Sierra Dominion, a small business owned by Julie Doolittle, provided marketing, event planning, and related services to the Greenberg Traurig law firm, and its partner, Jack Abramoff, from August 2002 through March 2004.\\" \\"Sierra Dominion had a retainer arrangement with Greenberg Traurig under which it provided services concerning the Spy Museum event and also the Signatures and Stacks restaurants\\". (The two restaurants were owned by Abramoff.) Julie Doolittle's records in connection with her work for Abramoff have been subpoenaed by the United States Department of Justice. The DOJ has not filed any charges in either case. No explanation has been given as to why Greenberg Taurig made the payments to Julie Doolittle, rather than the foundation (for whom the charity event was planned) or the restaurants or Abramoff personally (as restaurant owner). Doolittle's actions on behalf of Indian tribes In February 2002, Doolittle was among more than two dozen lawmakers who signed a letter to Secretary of the Interior Gale Norton urging her to reject an Indian casino opposed by Abramoff's tribal clients. In October 2003, Doolittle appealed in a letter to Norton for quicker action for the Mashpee Wampanoag people of Massachusetts, which was seeking federal recognition as a tribe; the Wampanoag group was also a client of Greenberg Traurig, and Kevin Ring was a lobbyist on the account. Doolittle's actions on behalf of the Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) One of Abramoff's major clients was the government (Commonwealth) of the Northern Mariana Islands. Doolittle visited the islands in February 1999 as part of a congressional delegation. In April 2000 and April 2001, he met with CNMI House Speaker Benigno R. Fitial in Washington D.C. On May 25, 2001, the Saipan Tribune printed a letter from Doolittle to Fitial, which noted a recent $150,000 earmark, mentioned two possible Army Corps of Engineers projects on the islands, and said \\"I will urge the Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee to include funding for the feasibility study for both projects in the FY 2002 appropriations bill.\\"\\"Letter from Congressman John T. Doolittle, Republican of California, to Speaker Ben Fitial on various issues pertaining to the NMI\\" , Saipan Tribune, May 25, 2001 In August 2001, he backed Fitial's candidacy for governor.\\"Doolittle backs Fitial's candidacy\\" , Saipan Tribune, August 20, 2001 Doolittle was successful in securing $400,000 in Corps study funds in 2001, his first year on the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development.Paul Kiel, \\"Doolittle was Abramoff Island Client's 'Hero'\\" , TPMMuckraker.com, August 4, 2006 In the governor's election in early 2002, Fitial lost. The new governor, Juan N. Babauta, cancelled the contract with Greenberg Traurig. Justice Department actions and hiring of lawyer Since then, \\"The congressman has not been subpoenaed or questioned by the Justice Department,\\" as of December, 2005. On January 27, 2006, three weeks after Abramoff pleaded guilty to three federal felonies, Doolittle retained the legal services of the Virginia law firm of Williams Mullen. Doolittle's chief of staff, Richard Robinson, said the attorney handling Doolittle's inquiry is David Barger. Barger is the former president of the Virginia Bar Association's criminal law section and a former assistant US attorney who later was an associate of special prosecutor Kenneth Starr in the Whitewater investigation during the Clinton administration.David Whitney, \\"Legislator tied to Abramoff hires lawyer\\" , McClatchy News Service, April 18, 2006 Robinson said the campaign (which paid a $10,000 retainer) has hired Barger to address Doolittle's concerns about how he should respond to questions from the press as he contemplated having to talk about the scandal as part of his campaign for re-election. \\"The congressman has not retained an attorney to respond to any Justice Department inquiries as there have been none,\\" Robinson said. =Activities of Julie Doolittle= John Doolittle, Steve Lund (President of the Roseville Rotary) and Julie Doolittle at a Rotary lunch on August 1, 2006. During the 2001-2005 period, Julie Doolittle had at least three different occupations: she worked for Jack Abramoff doing event planning (see above); she worked as a bookkeeper for a lobbying firm; and she worked on commission as a fundraiser for her husband. (Richard Robinson, Doolittle's chief of staff, said Julie Doolittle had other clients. But he refused to provide their names \\"out of respect for the privacy of the clients.\\") Payments to Julie Doolittle during the period were done via a company called Sierra Dominion Financial Solutions. It was founded in March 2001, just after Congressman Doolittle gained a seat on the Appropriations Committee. It is based at the couple's home in Oakton, Virginia; Julie is the only employee. The company (that is, Julie) has continued to do fundraising, but no event planning or other work, since the Abramoff scandal first became public in early 2005. Work for lobbying firm From 2002 until mid-2005, the Alexander Strategy Group, a Washington, D.C. lobbying firm with close ties to Congressman Tom DeLay, paid Sierra Dominion for bookkeeping work for a nonprofit group called the Korea-U.S. Exchange Council (KORUSEC), created by Ed Buckham, a partner in the firm, and located at the ASG headquarters. KORUSEC is also connected to Kevin Ring, one of Doolittle's former assistants. =Maryland ‚Äì Edward B.

In popular culture * The Abramoff scandal was the basis of the Law & Order: Criminal Intent episode \\"Wasichu\\", in which a lobbyist's wife is murdered. The lobbyist was found to have been bribing a Congressman with lavish gifts and fact- finding trips on private jets, and was also double-dealing on the issue of an Indian casino. The lobbyist in this episode used the term \\"gimme five\\" to describe his schemes. * CollegeHumor referred to the scandal in their video \\"Rejected Song Parodies 2\\".

It was founded in 1968 by recording engineer Joseph Tarsia.David Simons, Studio Stories, Backbeat Books, 2004, pp182-185 Located at 212 North 12th Street in Philadelphia, it was one of the first studios in the United States to offer 24-track recording and the first anywhere to successfully employ console automation. Tarsia, formerly chief engineer at Philadelphia's Cameo-Parkway Studios, also opened Sigma Sound Studios of New York City in 1977, at the Ed Sullivan Theater building. From its beginning, Sigma Sound was strongly associated with Philadelphia soul and, in the 1970s, the sound of Gamble and Huff's Philadelphia International Records (its driving rhythm a precursor to disco music), as well as the classic, sophisticated productions of Thom Bell. Both featured large productions with strings and horns creating what became known as the \\"Philadelphia Sound\\". Their success attracted many artistes and producers from various music genres across the US, as well as Europe and Japan. By the late 1970s, Sigma was operating 10 music rooms on a 24-7 schedule. Sigma's long-time general manager, Harry Chipetz, managed the business operations and worked hand-in-hand with Tarsia in developing a staff that numbered close to 50 at its peak. Sigma is credited with well over 200 gold and platinum awards with an extensive client list that begins with Aretha Franklin and ends with ZZ Top. David Bowie recorded much of his album Young Americans in August 1974 at Sigma Philadelphia. Madonna used the New York studios to record her 1983 debut album, Madonna. On April 15, 1972, singer- songwriter and pianist Billy Joel and his touring band played an hour-long concert at Sigma Studios. The recording of \\"Captain Jack\\" from this event received extensive radio play in the Philadelphia area, long before Joel became widely known, which helped him establish a national following. Tarsia sold the New York studios in 1988 and the Philadelphia location in 2003, but they still retained the Sigma Sound Studios name. The 6,000 unclaimed tapes from Sigma's 35-year-old tape library are now part of The Drexel University Audio Archive. It was reported in the April 2015 issue of Pro Sound News, (a NewBay Media publication), that \\"the building that houses the historic Sigma Sound Studios in Philadelphia has been sold for $1.55 million, with the intention of renovating the space for office, retail or residential use.\\" The studios had closed for business in 2014, according to the www.philly.com website. When checked on April 9, 2015, the Sigma Sound Studios website was still available for viewing, but it has since been taken down. On October 15, 2015, the original building for Sigma Sound Studios was officially dedicated as a historic site by the City of Philadelphia. The historic site marker was placed at 212 N. 12th Street.  Special Collections Research Center at Temple University  Information on Sigma Sound Studios exists at the Special Collections Research Center at Temple University in Philadelphia. The memorabilia available includes newspaper and magazine clippings, collected ephemera and other publications. There are also photographs of both the New York City and Philadelphia studios, as well as advertising and promotional materials which include \\"AddZest\\" materials that are primarily in Japanese. Additionally, there is a limited selection of several types of studio records, and clippings.

Civil War With the impending dissolution of the United States in 1861, Bedford County voters elected Goode to the Virginia secession convention, alongside former Congressman William L. Goggin, who had represented Bedford County years earlier in the House of Delegates, then in the U.S. House of Representatives for most of the decade between 1839 and 1849.Leonard pp. xxv, 474 That convention passed the Ordinance of Secession in April, and voters ratified it in May, following a meeting with orations by Goode, Goggin, James F. Johnson (who would become the Virginia Senate's president pro tempore 1861-1865), and William M. Burwell.Lula Jeter Parker and Peter Viemeister(ed.), Parker's History of Bedford County, Virginia (Bedford, Virginia: Hamilton's 1988 isbn 0-9608598) p. 18 Goode then volunteered to fight, joining Company A of the 2nd Virginia Cavalry as a private on May 11, 1861, as did Dr. Reginald H.

During the recesses of that body, he acted as volunteer aide on the staff of Maj. Gen. Jubal A. Early, a fellow lawyer and Secession Convention delegate from nearby Franklin County, first from October 5, 1861 through December 1862, and again in 1864.Appleton's Cyclopedia, Vol. 2, p. 678Driver p. 222 Postwar politics and law After the war, Goode resumed his law practice, but moved to the state's Hampton Roads area by 1867. Like many high-ranking ex-Confederates, Goode had his civil rights restored under the provisions of Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment. After W.H.C. Ellis resigned in early 1866, Goode and A.F. Leonard came to represent the city of Norfolk in the state House of Delegates for the December 1866 and March-April 1867 sessions.Leonard p. 501 and note 4 However, Norfolk voters replaced Goode and Leonard with the Radical Republicans Henry S. Bowden and A.S. Segar in 1869.Leonard p. 509 Nonetheless, he became the primary speaker at the 1875 dedication of a monument for Confederate war dead in Bedford, assisted by W.W. Berry (although the monument was later relocated from Piedmont hill to Longwood cemetery).Parker p. 47 Goode continued his legal practice in Norfolk, and came to practice law in Washington, D.C., after his election to Congress as discussed below.Appleton's Cyclopedia, vol. 2, p. 678 He also became a member of the boards of visitors of the University of Virginia, William and Mary College, and the Virginia Agriculture and Mechanical College.Virginia Biographical Encyclopedia (1915), available on ancestry.com He also wrote a memoir of his life, \\"Recollections of a Lifetime\\".Parker p. 127 Congress In 1875, Goode defeated former Vermonter and three-term Republican incumbent James H. Platt Jr. to represent Virginia's 2nd congressional district, thus attended the Forty-fourth United States Congress as a Democrat, and won re-election to the Forty-fifth United States Congress and the Forty-sixth United States Congress, serving from December 6, 1875, until March 3, 1881. He was Chairman of the Committee on Education and Labor during his last two terms. He had defeated Republican businessman John F. Dezendorf in 1878, but lost to Dezendorf in the November 1880 election. Goode was an active Democrat, and part of what sometimes became known the Staples Organization (a predecessor of the Byrd Organization), serving as a presidential elector in 1852, 1856, and 1884, and attending the Democratic National Conventions of 1868 and 1872. In May 1885, President Grover Cleveland, a fellow Democrat, appointed Goode as the acting Solicitor General of the United States, and he continued as such until August 1886. During that time, Goode visited British Columbia to represent the United States in an extradition case.Appleton's Cyclopedia, vol. 2, p. 678 He later served on the United States and Chilean Claims Commission and was President of the Virginia Bar Association in 1898.Virginia Biographical Encyclopedia (1915) available on ancestry.com 1902 Virginia Constitutional Convention Although he had long lived in Norfolk and Washington D.C., Goode continued to own property (and have family) in Bedford County, whose voters elected Goode and John Thompson Brown to represent them at the Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1901 and 1902.Leonard p. 573 Fellow delegates unanimously elected Goode the convention's president. In his acceptance speech, before deliberations had begun, Goode (to applause) denounced both Congressional Reconstruction and the Constitutional Convention of 1867-1868, \\"Congress not only committed a stupendous blunder, but a crime against civilization and Christianity when, against the advice of their wisest leaders, they required the people of Virginia and the South, under the rule of bayonet, to submit to universal negro suffrage.\\"Brent Tarter, The Grandees of Government (University of Virginia Press 2013) p. 265, citing Report of the Proceedings and Debates of the Constitutional Convention State of Virginia Held in the City of Richmond June 12, 1901 to June 26, 1902, pp. 19-20 That convention ultimately stripped not only the 1868 state constitution's clauses denouncing rebellion against the United States and explicitly outlawing slavery, it also strictly forbad education of white and colored children in the same school. Disenfranchisement became the subject of much debate; delegate Carter Glass explained how it would inevitably cut 4/5ths of the negro voters. Thus, large sections of the final document restricted voting to war veterans and their sons, property owners who paid at least $1000 in taxes during the previous year, and any man who could give a satisfactory explanation of any portion of the state constitution, as well as allowed the legislature to establish further voting restrictions.Tarter pp. 266-267 Despite pre-convention promises that voters would have a choice of ratifying the final document, the delegates voted to proclaim it as in effect as of July 10, 1902 and never submitted it to voters. Lawyer, former Confederate and Readjuster John S. Wise pursued two federal cases which contested that lack of submission, as well as delegates' intent to disenfrancise colored voters, but federal judges relied on an 1895 case arising out of the South Carolina convention to find they lacked jurisdiction. Supreme Court Justice Brewer elaborated, that in the William Jones case, the U.S. House of Representatives seated his opponent despite complaints, noting \\"the thing sought to be prohibited has been done and cannot be undone by order of court\\" so the U.S. Supreme Court declined to get involved.Tarter p. 270 citing Jones v.

By the 18th century, Babolsar had become a busy commercial port. During the reign of Nadir Shah, it was the base for Iran's Caspian fleet. By 1909, the port yielded 12 percent of the total customs revenue of Iran. However, by 1895, ports in Gilan were already competing with Babolsar. During Reza Shah's reign, Babolsar lost much of its remaining trade to the new port of Bandar-e Shah at the terminus of the trans-Iranian railroad. The cargo handled at Babolsar in the years of 1935 and 1936 was only 25,000 tons. A modern quarter and a hotel were built during this period. The end of World War II brought a new era of vitality to the city as a summer seaside resort for people from Tehran, which gave rise to a new phase of rapid expansion.

Phillips (February 18, 1824 ‚Äì November 18, 1903) was a civil rights pioneer, lawyer, politician who served as the second Solicitor General of the United States from 1872 to 1885). He then took part in the landmark civil rights case, Plessy v. Ferguson.  Early life  Samuel F. Phillips was born in New York. His father, James Phillips, was a British mathematician. When Samuel was about two years of age his father became the first professor of mathematics at the newly formed University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC) and the family moved to Chapel Hill, North Carolina.  Education  Samuel Phillips graduated from UNC with highest honors in 1841, earning a master's degree three years later. He began his own law practice in North Carolina and joined the UNC law department as a tutor before embarking on a career in politics, beginning with his election as a Whig to the North Carolina General Assemblies of 1852 and 1854. Phillips served on North Carolina's state North Carolina Court of Claims in 1861, and as state auditor from 1862-1864.  Political career Phillips had been an opponent of secession and during the U.S. Civil War he became a member of the \\"Peace Party\\" of newspaper publisher William Woods Holden (1818‚Äì1892), whose 1863 \\"peace meetings\\" across North Carolina urged the state to stop fighting the Civil War. In 1864, Phillips was re-elected to the General Assembly, serving as Speaker of the House in 1866. He was a member of the first \\"Reconstruction Convention,\\" and joined the Republican Party, which earned him much condemnation as a \\"scalawag.\\" He fought for the expansion of legal rights for African-Americans, triumphing in granting freedmen the right to testify in cases in which they were parties. In 1866 Phillips left politics to return to the private practice of law. In the Fall of 1867 he moved his family to Raleigh, North Carolina, where he became North Carolina's Supreme Court Reporter. He returned to politics in 1870. In 1871, Phillips served another term in the North Carolina House of Representatives. In 1872, Phillips was appointed the second U.S. Solicitor General by President Ulysses S. Grant, serving in this position from November 1872 to May 1885. During Phillips's twelve and one-half years as solicitor general, he served under four presidents: Grant, Hayes, Garfield, and Arthur. Phillips argued the constitutionality of the 1871 Enforcement Act and advocated upholding a conviction of several Ku Klux Klan members who assaulted a black man for voting in a congressional election. Citing Article I of the U.S. Constitution, he set a precedent used in the 1960s to validate the expansion of federal control over the election process. He also argued Reynolds v. United States, 98 U.S. 145 (1879). Phillips was part of the team who argued the Civil Rights Cases of 1883, using both the Civil Rights Act of 1875 and the 13th and 14th Amendments as a defense. As part of the legal counsel representing Homer Plessy in the landmark Plessy v. Ferguson case, he argued that the \\"separate- but-equal\\" doctrine was nothing less than a disparagement of African-Americans on the basis of color, much like slavery. After serving as Solicitor General, he went on to become a member of the U.S. and Venezuela Mixed Claims Commissions of 1888 and 1891. Phillips returned to private law practice in Washington, D.C. until 1901. Personal life Phillips married Frances R. Lucas (1831‚Äì1883), on December 3, 1849, at Chapel Hill. They had 10 children. In 1889 Phillips married Sarah Maury; she died in 1902. They had no children. Samuel Phillips died on November 18, 1903, aged 79, in Washington, D.C. His body was later moved to Chapel Hill, North Carolina. Cornelia Phillips Spencer (1825-1908), a North Carolina educational activist and author, is his sister.

The town is known for the first recorded Catholic Eucharistic Miracle. Lanciano is located about from the Adriatic Sea in an elevated spot.  Geography  The town is located on hills and its town territory covers from Val di Sangro to Castelfrentano, and its elevation is about above sea level. It is bordered by Atessa, Castel Frentano, Fossacesia, Frisa, Mozzagrogna, Orsogna, Paglieta, Poggiofiorito, Rocca San Giovanni, San Vito Chietino, Sant'Eusanio del Sangro and Treglio.

History Eucharistic Miracle of Lanciano in the Santuario di San Francesco Basilica's bell tower and Ponte Diocleziano The ancient Roman name of Lanciano was Anxanum, a city of the Frentani Italic tribe. The city is said to have been founded in 1181 BC by Solimus, a Trojan refugee arrived in Italy along with Aeneas. Legends aside, archaeological findings have shown that the area was settled from the 5th millennium BC. Under the Frentani it was probably under the influence of [Greater Greece]. After the end of the Samnite Wars, which saw the Frentani allied with the Romans, Lancianum obtained the status of municipium. It was probably a flourishing commercial site, across an ancient and important trade route connecting Pescara to Apulia. Plebiscite Square in Lanciano. During the fall of the Western Roman Empire, Lanciano was sacked by the Goths, and was destroyed during the Lombard invasion (c. 571 AD). A new settlement was then created around a castle built by the new rulers. In 610, however, it was conquered by the Byzantines, who annexed it to the Duchy of Teate (Chieti) and allowed the trades to restart. In the late 8th century Lanciano was conquered by the Franks, who included it in the Duchy of Spoleto. In 1060 the Normans made it a centre of the unified Kingdom of Sicily. Lanciano flourished again and in 1340 it was the largest city in Abruzzo with 6,500 inhabitants, renowned industries (ceramics, wool, silk, goldworks, ironworks), receiving important privileges by both Frederick II and his son Manfred, with a substantial administrative autonomy. Charles I, King of Sicily, assigned the revenues of the city's port to the Vatican Basilica. Later it was frequently at war with nearby Ortona. It was here that Pope Gregory XII, fleeing from Cividale, landed on Neapolitan territory (1409), and went thence to Gaeta. After the end of the Italian Wars, the new Spanish rule and the shift of commerce due to the discovery of America impoverished Lanciano, which, in 1640, became a baronial possession. Later, the city took the part of the Neapolitan Republic of 1799 and rose against the Bourbon kings in 1848, 1849 and 1853. In 1860 it voted for annexation to the newly formed Kingdom of Italy. During World War II it was an active center of the Resistance against the German occupation. On 6 October 1943 Italian citizens attacked German soldiers (revolt of the martyrs of October 1943). In 1952 it was awarded the Gold Medal to Military Valour by President Luigi Einaudi. Main sights The Basilica of Santa Maria del Ponte in Lanciano.

The New Order regime was launched by Selim III and a coalition of reformers. The central objective was the creation of a professional army along European lines and a private treasury to finance military spending, as well as other administrative reforms. The age of the New Order can be generally said to have lasted from 1789 to 1807, ending with the deposition of Selim III by a Janissary coup. While the term ‚ÄúNew Order‚Äù eventually came to encompass all of Selim III‚Äôs reforms, the name was used contemporaneously to refer only to the reform‚Äôs central innovation: the New Order Army. While that army was largely a failure in its own time, it reflects an important step in the stages of Ottoman attempts at reform in the Modern period. Selim III‚Äôs desire for an army necessitated far-reaching changes in the bureaucracy and structure of the Ottoman Empire, and profoundly reorganized contemporary Ottoman politics. The New Order, writes historian Stanford Shaw, reflects a profound shift in Ottoman thinking on how to confront the West; where hitherto Ottomans had conceived of beating the West by returning to the glory days of the 16th century, the Nizam-i Djedid reforms were premised on the idea that Western ideas and processes had to be adopted in order to restore Ottoman global prestige.  Etymology  Nizam and cedid are loanwords from Arabic in Turkish. The equivalent phrase in Arabic would be , An-Ni·∫ìƒÅm Al-Jadƒ´d, meaning \\"new order\\". Instead, the adjective phrase is constructed using Persian rules, as is common in Ottoman Turkish. Selim III‚Äôs forces were designed to be a new force to counterbalance the Janissaries, which were regularly accused of being both ineffectual and of holding too much political power. The irony, however, was that yenicheri, the Turkish word for Janissaries, also means ‚Äúnew army‚Äù - thus leading to the designation of Nizam-i Cedid, ‚ÄúNew Order,‚Äù forces instead.  Origins  Ottoman Sultan Selim III, who carried out the reforms. The mid-to-late 18th century witnessed increasing great power competition as new empires - most notably Britain and France - arose and consolidated their respective dominions. The Ottoman Empire increasingly seemed to be falling behind their rivals - especially Russia and Austria, who had each dealt the Ottoman regime several defeats since the 1760s. The most notable of these was the 1774 Treaty of K√º√ß√ºk Kaynarca, which resulted in the loss of the Crimea to Russia. Russia also was given major concessions: for its ships to sail freely in the Black Sea, access to the Mediterranean, as well as consulates and an embassy in Ottoman territory. In 1774, Sultan Mustafa summed up the atmosphere of the time in verse: ‚ÄúThe world is in decay, do not think it will be right with us; The state has declined into meanness and vulgarity, Everyone at the court is concerned with pleasure; Nothing remains for us but divine mercy‚Äù. He died shortly thereafter. While his successor and brother Abdulhamid I initiated a second war in an attempt to reclaim what had been lost in Crimea, it was a disaster. A decisive battle in 1789 became a show of Ottoman military weakness: 120,000 Janissaries were defeated by 8,000 Russian troops on the shores of the Danube. New Order reformers argued that the Janissary corps had grown from a hardened fighting force into an entrenched interest group with little interest in training and fighting. In 1789, Selim III inherited the throne from his uncle Abdulhamid at the age of 28. He also inherited the Second Russian-Turkish War, which resulted in a humiliating loss for the empire and reinforcement of the disaster of K√º√ß√ºk Kaynarca at the Treaty of Jassy in 1792. Selim headed a coalition of reformers and quickly convened a consultative assembly to advance tajdid, or renewal. While Selim III often receives credit for the military reforms, he was hardly the sole instigator. Ideas for reform - especially of military reform - had preoccupied the Ottoman political class for nearly a century before Selim III took the throne. The first Western-style military training in the Ottoman world was done without the Sultan‚Äôs knowledge. In 1790, as Stanford Shaw documents, Koca Yusuf Pasha organized a separate corps to drill a select core of soldiers in the midst of the Second Russian-Turkish War (Shaw 294).  Reforms  The primary focus on the New Order reforms - for which all others were named - was military reform. Selim III, having seen his armies easily routed by European forces, brought foreign lecturers to serve as military advisers and organized two colleges - for Naval and Army Engineering, respectively - along European lines, with French as the language of instruction. Selim also embarked on an institutional reorganization of the Armed Forces, bringing Artillery and Transportation into the same department. The investment quickly paid results - several hundred New Order forces widely outperformed conventional Ottoman troops in the 1799 defense of Acre against Napoleon Bonaparte. The greatest threat to the New Order remained the Janissaries. Indeed, ‚Äú[the Janissaries‚Äô] shortcomings were simply indicative of deeper financial, organizational and disciplinary problems affecting the Ottoman state\\". In its initial stages, the whole reform had to be hidden in order to avoid provoking them by embedding the New Order Troops within another unit. While in theory, the Janissaries were also subject to reform and training according to the European style, they would resist it in practice. While some of the more radical reformers urged Selim to abolish the Janissaries, this proved a major political problem in practice. There were also attempts to co-opt the Janissaries: the Sublime Porte issued decrees praising the Janissaries‚Äô role in Ottoman history as well as assuring them that their salaries would continue. The military reforms, however, also entailed a whole host of economic reforms. The new military demanded new forms of taxation and the uprooting of entrenched elite groups - the ‚ÄúNew Order Army‚Äù had to be financed by a ‚ÄúNew Treasury‚Äù - Irad-i Cedid. Absentee or irresponsible timar holders would find their licenses cancelled and seized by the government.New taxes were levied, and old taxes were re-appropriated to fund the New Treasury- including taxes on alcohol and wool. Ottomans also embarked on broader reforms of the tariffs system. While non-Muslims had previously enjoyed special privileges by manipulating the concessions, administrators strove to crack down on this loss of state rent. Selim III also reorganized the provinces from an administrative standpoint. In 1795, Selim III proposed new governance structures in an attempt to reverse the trend of the empire towards decentralization. The government lacked military or financial resources to carry out their policy, however, making centralization an ‚Äúunattainable ideal‚Äù. While these reformers called for revamping the Ottoman system and Europeanization of the military, they were by no means antagonistic to Islam. In many cases, the call for reform saw Islamic renewal and military-administrative-economic renewal as intertwined and mutually dependent. Military discipline often entailed the memorization of religious texts.  End of the New Order  The reform coalition with which Selim came to power was not stable. Different members of the bureaucracy used the New Order discourse as a way to secure personal advancement, switching sides on the question of reform depending on personal interests. Few local notables were pleased with new tax arrangements for that New Order Army, for example, since they undermined old tax-farming rent sources. Money for the ‚ÄúNew Revenue‚Äù system which was raised by reclaiming vacant tax-farms for the state (Finkel 2005). The accumulation of capital had enabled local elites to challenge the center, and they had no interest in giving up their power willingly. While some notables benefited from the reform, others - such as Tayyar Pasha, were excluded. The Janissaries became increasingly aware of the threats posed by the New Order to their privileges. In 1806, during the famous Edirne incident, local janissaries and notables joined to lynch a qadi who had come to recite an imperial decree announcing the deployment of New Order troops to the region. Janissaries also exploited general resentment over Westernization and higher taxes to fund the New Order in order to gain popular support for the rebellion that would bring an end to the New Order in 1807.

It is open free to the public Tuesdays through Saturdays, 9:00 A.M. to 5:00 P.M. It is the primary project of the Stanley W. Hayes Research Foundation, a private operating foundation. The Foundation owns a total of of property in Wayne County, IN. Description The Arboretum is an educational facility and a managed nature preserve, collecting native wild plants indigenous to Wayne county and the Whitewater Valley Drainage Basin (an area encompassing 14 counties in west-central Ohio and east-central Indiana). It had claimed to include 172 species of trees, plants and shrubs native to the basin, but a 2007 study actually found 525 species. It also contains a renovated 1833 dairy barn, Beech-Maple Trail (3/4 mile), Habitat Trail (1 mile), Springhouse Trail (1/4 mile), and History Trail (1 mile). The Arboretum was first established in June 1915 when Stanley Wolcott Hayes began purchasing tracts of land to preserve the local old growth Beech-Maple Forest. He began reforesting the land, planting thousands of native trees and creating experimental plots, hoping to restore the land as when the first pioneers arrived. His estate, now Hayes Arboretum, includes: * Beech-maple forest ‚Äî trees up to 450 years old. Approximately of old-growth forest are located within the Arboretum grounds. * Oak-Tulip Experiment ‚Äî White Oaks and Tulip trees, planted in 1922-23 as an experiment in hardwood reforestation. * Mabelle Hayes Fern Garden ‚Äî an under story of dogwoods in this area, with a fern garden featuring ferns and their allies native to the Whitewater River valley, including 20 species that have been naturalized along the trail with a variety of spring flowers. A few of the ferns are evergreen and in evidence all year long. * Paul C. McClure Native Woody Plant Preserve ‚Äî a nature reserve with tree, shrubs, and vines native to the Whitewater Valley Drainage Basin. It serves as an example of how these trees would grow over hundreds of years with plenty of space. * Hayes Arboretum and Waterworks Mounds ‚Äî two mounds attributed to the Adena and the Hopewell people are located on the East Side of the property. Excavated by James Heilman from 1965-66, multiple artifacts were discovered inside each of the mounds, including tools, bones, and stone points. Although not native to the Arboretum, the Arboretum includes the geology collection of a former Earlham College professor Dan Kinsey, who donated his collection in 1968. It contains at least one example of every type of rock native to Indiana. Hayes Family Museum A small historic gas station that was moved to the site has been restored for use as a museum documenting the history of the Hayes Family and the Hayes Track Appliance Company. Nature Center An 1833 dairy barn houses the arboretum's nature center, which includes information and interpretive displays about trees, native woods, flora and fauna. The building also contains a bird watching room, a live honey bee exhibit, and a sensory room full of natural objects and live specimens. Many programs are offered about regional plants, wildlife, and other nature related topics. Restrooms and a drinking fountain are located inside the Nature Center.

Track Records) was founded in 1966 in London by Kit Lambert and Chris Stamp, then managers of the rock group The Who.Discogs - Track Record profile and discography It was one of the first British-owned independent record labels in the United Kingdom. The most successful artists whose work appeared on the Track label were The Jimi Hendrix Experience, The Who, The Crazy World of Arthur Brown, Thunderclap Newman and Golden Earring. The label ceased operations in 1978 but was revived in 1999. Background Track was originally intended to provide more creative freedom for the Who, but according to Stamp, at the end of 1966, he and Lambert were spurred to set up Track in order to get involved with new arrival from the United States, Jimi Hendrix.The Jimi Hendrix Experience, Live At Monterey DVD Even though Hendrix was not in need of management (as he had already signed an agreement with Chas Chandler) he was in need of a UK label. Lambert and Stamp had already grappled with the rigid confines of the established record companies. In 1966, they were involved in a court battle to release The Who from an onerous contract with producer Shel Talmy and the Decca (US) and Brunswick (UK) labels. At this time, Lambert and Stamp started releasing the Who's records in the United Kingdom on Robert Stigwood's Reaction Records label. Both Track and Reaction were very much reliant upon distribution support in the United Kingdom from the large Polydor Records label based in Germany. Polydor's involvement with these two small labels can be seen as its learning process about the rock music market. Polydor was interested in expanding its base beyond easy listening and ballads. Its best known artist at the time was Bert Kaempfert. History = 1966‚Äì1969 = Hendrix' first single \\"Hey Joe\\" was intended for release by Track, but since the label was not yet fully in operation it was first released in the United Kingdom on Polydor in December 1966. His second single \\"Purple Haze\\", released on 17 March 1967, was the first Track Records single and Are You Experienced was the first LP. These and other Hendrix recordings released by Track were licensed to Reprise Records in the United States. The first Who single on Track was \\"Pictures of Lily\\" released in April 1967. The same year Track also issued the Who singles \\"The Last Time\\" and \\"I Can See for Miles\\" and the LP The Who Sell Out. The Who stayed with Decca Records in the United States until 1972, when Decca was folded into its parent company MCA Records. By late 1967, Track faced a lawsuit from Ed Chalpin and his company PPX Enterprises, based in New York City. Chalpin had signed Hendrix to a three-year exclusive recording contract in October 1965. Chalpin viewed the 1966 Hendrix agreement with Track as a violation of his PPX contract and was later able to claim a large monetary settlement. Track quickly fell into financial trouble. Hendrix released Axis: Bold as Love in the United Kingdom in December 1967. The album appeared in the United States in January 1968 on Reprise. The Crazy World of Arthur Brown had a 1968 UK #1 hit with \\"Fire\\" which was co-produced by the Who's Pete Townshend and Kit Lambert. US versions of Arthur Brown's recordings were distributed by Atlantic Records; initial pressings of these records were branded with the Track Records imprint, and later ones with Atlantic's but retaining the same catalog numbers. \\"Fire\\" reached #2 on the US Billboard Hot 100 singles chart. Brown has claimed that he was never properly compensated by Track. Also in late 1968, Track released Jimi Hendrix's double album Electric Ladyland, one of his most successful recordings. Initial UK copies of the album featured a picture of 19 nude women which was not authorized by Hendrix. In 1968, Track began releasing compilations albums such as the Who's Direct Hits. Some of these, including Electric Jimi Hendrix (1970) and the Who's Who Did It! (1970), are thought to have been sold only on a very limited basis through mail order, making them extremely rare today. A various artists compilation titled The House That Track Built was issued in 1969. In 1970, Track began a 14-album series titled Backtrack 1 through Backtrack 14. These were budget priced re-issues and new compilations of earlier Track recordings, occasionally containing previously unreleased material and rare versions. This series, which was very unusual for its time, included both Hendrix and the Who's first two Track albums along with works by lesser known Track artists. The reissue albums did not feature any of the original cover art. Track also distributed the Apple Records release by John Lennon and Yoko Ono titled Two Virgins in the United Kingdom. Original stereo copies of this album from 1968 had a Track Records logo and matrix number (613 012) on the label. These were added to the artwork after EMI (Apple's distributor) refused to handle the record because of its controversial nude cover photo. Original UK mono copies of the record had no reference to Track, as these were apparently manufactured before Track assumed distribution. US distribution of Two Virgins was initially handled by Tetragrammaton Records. The Who released the double album Tommy on Track in 1969, which was one of their biggest selling albums. The US version of the album was on Decca. = 1970‚Äì1978 = In March 1970, Track issued the live Hendrix album Band of Gypsys. This was the last album authorized by Hendrix before his death. As part of a legal settlement with PPX Enterprises release rights for the United States were assigned to Ed Chalpin who arranged to have the album released by Capitol Records. The UK cover featured pictures of Hendrix as a doll. The US version replaced the doll photos with a photograph of Hendrix performing under multicolored lights. The Who released the album Live at Leeds in May 1970. In late 1970, the group Thunderclap Newman released their only album, Hollywood Dream on Track (through Atlantic in the United States). The album was another Pete Townshend production and contained the UK #1 hit \\"Something in the Air\\". The song also reached #25 in the United States. Track released a three-song EP by Jimi Hendrix titled Voodoo Chile which was Hendrix's only No. 1 UK hit in 1971. After the posthumous Jimi Hendrix album The Cry of Love Polydor took over Hendrix's catalogue, except for the United States and Canada, where it remained with Reprise Records. The Who released the compilation album Meaty Beaty Big and Bouncy and an album of new recordings Who's Next in late 1971, both of which were very successful. In 1972, the Dutch rock group Golden Earring had a successful UK tour with the Who and were signed to Track. Their album Moontan (1973) became their biggest international success. The album was released by Track/MCA in the United States. The hit song \\"Radar Love\\" was especially popular in the United States where the single reached #13. US versions of Who solo albums such as Pete Townshend's release Who Came First (1972) were released by Track/Decca. In 1973, The Who produced Quadrophenia, their last album of new material released by Track (Track/MCA in the United States). In 1974, the Who fulfilled their contract with Track by releasing Odds & Sods. This album was compiled by John Entwistle from a batch of previously unreleased Who recordings made between 1964 and 1972. In 1974, the Who parted ways with Lambert and Stamp amid litigation. In a move initiated by Roger Daltrey, the band attempted to collect a large sum of unpaid royalties from Track. The Who moved to Polydor, except in United States and Canada, where they remained with MCA. Polydor later became a sister label to MCA after Universal Music Group absorbed PolyGram in 1999. By 1975, Track was left with only Golden Earring on its roster, who also soon left. After this, Track only released two more LPs, one by the Heartbreakers, and one by Shakin' Stevens. Track ceased business operations in 1978, though Track albums that remained in print in the UK remained on the Track label until the distributor re-issued them on Polydor a few years later. Kit Lambert died in 1981 at age 45. = 1999‚Äìpresent = A new, revived Track Records has operated since 1999. It is run by former Stranglers, Cult, and Big Country manager Ian Grant.

Under his influence, the Naga National Council asserted the right to self-determination which took the shape of armed resistance after the Indian state imposed the Armed Forces Special Powers Act in 1958. The Naga secessionist groups regard him as the \\"Father of the Naga Nation\\". Early life Angami Zapu Phizo belonged to the Merh√ºma khel (clan) of Khonoma Village of Angami Naga tribe. He had collaborated with the Japanese army in Burma. Political life As the British were preparing for their withdrawal from India, Phizo separately met the indigenous Assamese, Garos, Khasis, Lushais, Abors, Mishmis and Meiteis leaders in an attempt to convince them to form independent countries of their own, instead of joining the proposed Union of India. However, his efforts failed. On 14 August 1947, one day before India gained its independence, Phizo declared the independence of Naga region. Phizo's influence in the Naga National Council (NNC) increased in late 1940s, after the NNC secretary Imti Aliba Ao retired from politics for an appointment in the Indian Frontier Administrative Services. Phizo was incarcerated in Calcutta's Presidency Jail in 1948 on charges of stirring trouble in the Indo- Burma borderland. After his release from the jail, he became the fourth president and the main ideologue of the National Naga Council. Phizo became the NNC Chairman in October‚ÄìNovember 1949 after defeating Vizar Angami of Zakhama village by a margin of one vote. Under his leadership, the NNC inclined towards seeking secession from India. Phizo urged the Naga people to boycott the Indian elections. He met the Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru in December 1951 near Tezpur in Assam, in March 1952 at Delhi, and in July 1952 at Dibrugarh. He also met with Jaipal Singh in 1952. He was arrested in Burma for illegal entry. In September 1954, Phizo formed the \\"People's Sovereign Republic of Free Nagaland\\", with the support of Chang chiefs of Tuensang. He also reorganized the NNC setup, as the chances of a peaceful settlement declined. In 1955, the Angami leaders T. Sakhrie (who had served the secretary of NNC since its inception) and J. B. Jasokie broke off with Phizo at a meeting in the Khonoma village. Phizo got Sakhrie murdered in January 1956. On 22 March 1956 he formed the \\"Naga Central Government\\", which was later renamed to \\"Federal Government of Nagaland\\" (FGN) in 1959. The new organization had a military wing. Phizo escaped to East Pakistan (present-day Bangladesh) in December 1956, from where he went to London. He continued supporting the secessionist movement in Nagaland, until his death in exile, in London in 1990. He had 11 children. When he escaped from the erstwhile Naga Hills to East Pakistan, he did not have an Indian passport. After acquiring a British passport while in London, the Indian embassy refused to issue him a visa to visit India. Khodao Yanthan said later, \\"Mr. Phizo was a perfect Naga leader.

Their break-up was a cumulative process attributed to numerous factors, such as the strain of the Beatlemania phenomenon, the death of manager Brian Epstein in 1967, McCartney's domineering role, Lennon's heroin use, his relationship with Yoko Ono, Harrison's prolific songwriting output, the floundering of Apple Corps and the Get Back project (later Let It Be, 1970), and managerial disputes. During the second half of the Beatles' career, the members began to assert individual artistic agendas. Their disunity became most evident on The Beatles (also known as \\"the White Album\\", 1968), and quarrels and disharmony over musical matters soon permeated their business discussions. Starr and Harrison briefly quit the group during the White Album and Get Back sessions, respectively. Starting in 1969, the group split into two camps regarding who should handle their business affairs. McCartney lobbied for entertainment lawyers Lee and John Eastman, but was outvoted by his bandmates in favour of businessman Allen Klein. The final time that the four members recorded together collectively was the session for Abbey Roads closing track \\"The End\\" on 18 August 1969. Lennon privately informed his bandmates that he was leaving the Beatles on 20 September, although it was unclear to the other members whether his departure was permanent. On 10 April 1970, McCartney issued a press release that stated he was no longer working with the group, which sparked a widespread media reaction and worsened the tensions between him and his bandmates. Legal disputes continued long after his announcement, and the dissolution was not formalised until 1974. Rumours of a full-fledged reunion persisted throughout the 1970s, as the members occasionally reunited for collaboration, but never with all four simultaneously. Starr's \\"I'm the Greatest\\" (1973) and Harrison's \\"All Those Years Ago\\" (1981) are the only tracks that feature three ex-Beatles. After Lennon's murder in 1980, the surviving members reunited for the Anthology project in 1994, using the unfinished Lennon demos \\"Free as a Bird\\" and \\"Real Love\\" as the basis for new songs recorded and released as the Beatles. Background By 1966, the Beatles had grown weary of live performance. George Harrison was the first to tire of Beatlemania, while Paul McCartney supported the idea of maintaining regular touring schedules and live shows. McCartney finally ceded to his bandmates' insistence that the group stop touring towards the end of their August tour of the United States. Afterward, Harrison informed manager Brian Epstein that he was leaving the band, but was persuaded to stay on the assurance that there would be no more tours. When the group convened to record Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band in November 1966, there was still a camaraderie and desire to collaborate as musicians; however, their individual differences were becoming more apparent. To a greater extent than the others, McCartney maintained a deep interest in the pop musical trends and styles emerging both in Britain and the United States, whereas Harrison developed an interest in Indian music and religion, and John Lennon's compositions became more introspective and experimental.Ray Coleman: Lennon: The Definitive Biography 3rd edition, Pan Publications, 2000 In Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn's opinion, Sgt. Pepper represented the group's last unified effort, displaying a cohesion that deteriorated immediately after the album's completion and entirely disappeared by 1968. Magical Mystery Tour, September 1967 Brian Epstein's management style was to let the group pursue their musical notions and projects, while often mediating when there was a conflict. This role began to diminish after the band stopped touring in 1966, although Epstein still exercised a strong influence, settling disputes among members and, most importantly, handling the group's finances. In mid-1967, Apple Corps was initiated under Epstein's oversight as a tax shelter endeavour. On 27 August, Epstein died of a medical drug overdose; the consequences of his absence, combined with the Beatles' inexperience as businessmen, led to an unexpectedly chaotic venture that added stress for the band during the coming months.MacDonald, Ian. Revolution in the Head, PIMLICO, 2005 Epstein's death left the Beatles disoriented and fearful about the future. McCartney sought to initiate projects for the group, although his bandmates grew perturbed by his growing domination in musical as well as other group ventures.Barry Miles: Paul McCartney: Many Years From Now, Owl Books, 1998 Lennon later reflected that McCartney's efforts were important for the survival of the band, but he still believed that McCartney's desire to help came from his own misgivings about pursuing a solo career.Jann Wenner: Lennon Remembers: The Rolling Stone Interviews, Popular Library, 1971 McCartney felt that the four members' evolution from musicians to businessmen was central to the band's disintegration. Epstein's role as band manager was never replaced, and ultimately the lack of strong managerial leadership contributed significantly to the break-up.Peter McCabe and Robert D. Schonfeld: Apple to the Core: The Unmaking of The Beatles, Martin Brian and O'Keeffe Ltd, 1972 Another factor in the split was Harrison's growth as a composer during the second half of their career.The New Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll, p. 419. Many of his song ideas were rejected by Lennon and McCartney, especially from 1968 onwards.The Editors of Rolling Stone, p. 38. While this was partly indicative of the increased competition for space on album sides, with three songwriters in the band, Harrison's frustration fostered in him a sense of alienation from the Beatles.\\"George Harrison Interview\\", Crawdaddy magazine, February 1977 He later reflected that at first he was content to make occasional contributions as a composer, and he only came to resent Lennon and McCartney's domination when he offered songs \\"that were better than some of theirs and we'd have to record maybe eight of theirs before they'd listen to mine\\". Harrison became the first member of the group to release a solo album, with Wonderwall Music, much of which was recorded in Bombay in January 1968. White Album and Get Back rehearsals In May 1968, the band met at Harrison's home in Esher to record demos of songs later recorded for their November 1968 release The Beatles (also known as \\"the White Album\\"). Contemporaneous reviews and retrospective commentary by the Beatles acknowledged that the double album reflected the development of autonomous composers, musicians and artists. Rolling Stone later described it as \\"four solo albums under one roof\\". McCartney described the sessions as a turning point for the group because \\"there was a lot of friction during that album. We were just about to break up, and that was tense in itself\\", while Lennon said that \\"the break-up of the Beatles can be heard on that album\\". Lennon's wife Yoko Ono, March 1969 The sessions marked the first appearance in the studio of Lennon's new domestic and artistic partner, Yoko Ono, who accompanied him to EMI Studios to work on \\"Revolution 1\\" and who would thereafter be a more or less constant presence at all Beatles sessions. Ono's presence was highly unorthodox, as prior to that point, the Beatles had generally worked in isolation, rarely inviting wives and girlfriends to recording sessions. Lennon's devotion to Ono over the other Beatles made working conditions difficult by impeding the intuitive aspect that had previously been essential to the band's music. Ono's presence was regarded as intrusive, and became a particular source of rancour with Harrison; because, since 1965, he and Lennon had bonded over their experimentation with LSD and Indian spirituality ‚Äì two experiences that McCartney had approached with a level of caution. Available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required). Lennon's and McCartney's artistic avenues became more disparate,The New Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll, p. 61. with McCartney disapproving of Lennon and Ono's experimental sound collage \\"Revolution 9\\",Emerick and Massey, pp. 243‚Äì44. and Lennon contemptuous of light-hearted McCartney songs such as \\"Martha My Dear\\" and \\"Honey Pie\\".Hertsgaard, p. 251. Harrison continued to develop as a songwriter, yet he received little support from within the band during the sessions.MacDonald, p. 267. Feeling resentment from Lennon and McCartney for his role in leading the Beatles to the Maharishi, Harrison's composition \\"Not Guilty\\" reflected his state of mind after their return from India. Ringo Starr became increasingly dissatisfied with the standard of his drumming. According to author Mark Hertsgaard, this was \\"a feeling that [McCartney] in particular had done much to encourage\\".Hertsgaard, pp. 250‚Äì51. Distressed also by the sour and tense atmosphere that was characteristic of the recording sessions,.Bob Spitz: The Beatles : The Biography, Little, Brown and Company, 2005 Starr felt so isolated that he left the band for several weeks and holidayed with his family in Sardinia.Ringo Starr, in The Beatles, p. 311. He returned in early September to find his drum kit decorated with flowers, which were a gift from Harrison.Ringo Starr, in The Beatles, p. 312. With the release of The Beatles in November, the band no longer gave collective interviews or recorded appearances, and public relations were carried out individually. Other evidence of the group's collective alienation came with the release of their 1968 Christmas fan club recording; the contributions were entirely individual and Lennon made disparaging remarks about his bandmates' apparent disdain for Ono.Hertsgaard, pp. 265‚Äì66. By the end of 1968, the Beatles' status as a group entity was in limbo. McCartney suggested a group project involving rehearsing, recording and then performing a set of songs for a live concert. The project soon adopted a working title of Get Back. Although the sessions for their double album had involved a degree of ensemble playing, the band were ill-prepared to settle comfortably back into this mode; in particular, Lennon had descended into heroin addiction, leaving him variously incommunicative or highly critical of the venture. On 10 January 1969, eight days after filmed rehearsals commenced at Twickenham Film Studios, Harrison's frustration and resentment peaked and he informed his bandmates that he was leaving. Having enjoyed rewarding collaborations outside the Beatles during much of 1968, particularly with Eric Clapton, Bob Dylan and the Band, the combined patronising by McCartney and estrangement from Lennon had taken its toll and the band were at an impasse and on the verge of collapse. Ultimately, complicated negotiations brought Harrison back into the group's activities. At Harrison's insistence, McCartney's plans for a full concert were abandoned and the project was relocated to the band's Apple Studio in Savile Row,Snow, p. 8. with the focus now on merely completing a new album of some of the songs rehearsed at Twickenham. The Beatles gave their last public performance on the rooftop of Apple's headquarters on 30 January 1969, as a substitute for an audience-based concert.John C. Winn: That Magic Feeling: The Beatles' Recorded Legacy (volume two) 1966‚Äì1970 Multiplus Books, 2003Doug Sulpy & Ray Schweighardt: Get Back: The Unauthorised Chronicle of The Beatles' \\"Let It Be\\" Disaster, St. Martin's Griffin Pub., 1999Peter Doggett: Abbey Road/Let It Be: The Beatles (Classic Rock Albums Series), Schirmer Books, 1998 Business difficulties Apple Corps building at 3 Savile Row In early 1969, Apple Corps was plagued by mismanagement and was losing money. On 26 January, Lennon and Ono met with Allen Klein, the founder of ABKCO Records, regarding managerial advice. Lennon requested that Klein represent his business interests in the band. McCartney, however, chose to be represented by American entertainment lawyers Lee and John Eastman, the father and brother of his girlfriend Linda Eastman, whom he married on 12 March. In April, after a series of rancorous meetings between Klein, the Eastmans and the Beatles, Klein was appointed as the band's business manager on an interim basis, with the Eastmans as the Beatles' lawyers. However, the band members' quarrels and disharmony over musical matters soon permeated their business discussions. Dick James, the managing director of Northern Songs (publisher of the Lennon‚ÄìMcCartney song catalogue) became increasingly concerned over the band's dissension and resentment towards him due to his refusal to renegotiate their royalty rate. Without informing Lennon or McCartney, James and Northern Songs' chairman Emmanuel Silver accepted a bid from the British entertainment conglomerate Associated Television (ATV) to sell their 32% stake in the company and recommended other shareholders do the same, which would give ATV a controlling interest. Lennon and McCartney, who together owned 26% of the stock, made a bid to gain a controlling interest in Northern Songs but were unsuccessful. The Eastmans and Klein soon developed an adversarial relationship given their disparate advice and counsel. Conflicting advice regarding an offer to purchase Brian Epstein's NEMS Enterprises, which still collected 25% of the Beatles' income, resulted in a missed opportunity and the Epstein family sold their 90% stake to Triumph Investment Trust instead. Given a choice between Klein and the Eastmans, Harrison and Starr opted for Klein. The Eastmans were dismissed as the Beatles' legal representation, and on 8 May, Lennon, Harrison and Starr signed a contract with Klein to be the band's business manager. This further aggravated the underlying mistrust and antipathy experienced within the band.Peter Brown & Steven Gaines: The Love You Make: An Insider's Story of The Beatles (Reprint edition), NAL Trade, 2002 Rolling Stone magazine states that \\"Klein is easily the least famous of the four [new people in the Beatles' lives], but arguably the one who played the biggest role in their demise.\\" Abbey Road and Lennon's departure Lennon rehearsing \\"Give Peace a Chance\\", June 1969 With the troubled Get Back project put on hold, the group continued to record together sporadically during the spring and early summer of 1969. Otherwise, the band members became increasingly involved in activities outside the band; among these, Lennon launched an international peace campaign with Ono, spearheaded by their single \\"Give Peace a Chance\\";Wiener, pp. 114‚Äì15. Harrison continued to focus on producing Apple Records signings, including Jackie Lomax, Billy Preston and devotees from the London Radha Krishna Temple;Leng, pp. 55, 58‚Äì59. and Starr began to establish himself as a film actor.Clayson, pp. 193‚Äì94.Fred Dellar, \\"Starring Role\\", in Mojo: The Beatles' Final Years, p. 84. Their occasional sessions together over the first half of the year ultimately paved the way for the Beatles' last studio recording project, Abbey Road. The 18 August session for \\"The End\\" marked the final occasion that all four members recorded collectively. The last time the foursome were together in the same studio was for the completion and mixing of \\"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\\" two days later. On 8 September, while Starr was in hospital, Lennon, McCartney and Harrison met to discuss recording a follow- up to Abbey Road. In the meeting Lennon and Harrison expressed frustration with having to compete with McCartney to get their songs recorded. Lennon proposed a different approach to songwriting by ending the Lennon‚ÄìMcCartney pretence and having four compositions apiece from Lennon, McCartney and Harrison, with two from Starr and a lead single around Christmas. Harrison referred to the possibility of a new Beatles album in an interview he gave in November, and he called this songwriting arrangement \\"an equal rights thing\\". McCartney later dismissed the new division of songwriting, saying it \\"wasn't the right balance\\" and was \\"too democratic for its own good\\".Hertsgaard, p. 282. Speaking to Melody Maker in September, Lennon said: \\"The trouble is we've got too much material. Now that George is writing a lot, we could put out a double album every month ...\\" During the 8 September meeting, McCartney expressed that, before Abbey Road, he \\"thought that George's songs weren't that good\\", to which Lennon reacted by saying none of the other Beatles liked McCartney's \\"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da\\" and \\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\\" and that those types of songs should be given to other artists to record. Soon after the sessions for Abbey Road, Lennon's heroin use inspired him to record \\"Cold Turkey\\" with his and Ono's conceptual group, the Plastic Ono Band, after the Beatles had rejected the song for release as a single. The formation of the Plastic Ono Band was conceived as an artistic outlet for Lennon and Ono, but the enthusiastic reception afforded their performance at the Toronto Rock and Roll Revival on 13 September 1969 ostensibly crystallised Lennon's decision to leave the Beatles, which he made on the flight back to London. During a band meeting at Apple on 20 September, he informed McCartney, Starr and Klein of his decision (Harrison was not present at the meeting), telling them he wanted a \\"divorce\\". That same day, the band signed a renegotiated recording contract with Capitol Records, guaranteeing them a higher royalty rate.Miles, p. 353. The sensitivity of the negotiations with Capitol led to Klein and McCartney urging Lennon to keep his announcement private, which Lennon agreed to do. On 25 November, Lennon's comments from a recent radio interview were reported in an NME article titled \\"The Beatles on the Brink of Splitting\\". Among his remarks, Lennon said that the running of Apple had superseded the band's music-making and he went \\"off and on\\" the idea of the group recording together again. McCartney later recalled that in the three or four months after Lennon's announcement, he, Harrison and Starr would phone each other asking, \\"Well, is this it, then?\\" McCartney said that they suspected that it might be \\"one of John's little flings\\" and that Lennon might change his mind, since he \\"did kind of leave the door open\\". In early January 1970, while visiting Denmark with Ono, Lennon told a journalist that \\"we‚Äôre not breaking up the band, but we‚Äôre breaking its image\\" and added that none of the Beatles were millionaires, which is why before long they would record a new album. Announcement =Release of McCartney and Let It Be= Having long attempted to maintain cohesiveness within the Beatles, McCartney secluded himself with his new family at his Scottish farm, distraught at Lennon's departure.Rodriguez, p. 1. After being tracked down by reporters from Life magazine in late October 1969, McCartney said that \\"the Beatle thing is over\\", although the full meaning of this remark was ignored.Sounes, pp. 262‚Äì63. Effectively estranged from his bandmates and deeply depressed,Sounes, pp. 263‚Äì64. McCartney begun making a series of home recordings in London during December. Operating under strict secrecy, McCartney privately agreed on a release date for this proposed solo album, titled McCartney, with Apple Records executive Neil Aspinall.Spizer, p. 116. Let It Be producer Phil Spector (1965) On 3 and 4 January 1970, McCartney, Harrison and Starr reconvened at Abbey Road Studios to record Harrison's \\"I Me Mine\\" and complete work on McCartney's song \\"Let It Be\\".Sulpy & Schweighardt, p. 315. Both tracks were needed for the Let It Be album,MacDonald, pp. 296, 322. as the threat of legal action by American film company United Artists led to a decision to finally prepare the Get Back recordings and footage for release. In March, producer Phil Spector was invited to work on the tapes. Although McCartney has claimed that he was unaware of Spector's involvement until receiving an acetate of the Let It Be album in April,MacDonald, p. 297.Paul McCartney and George Martin, in The Beatles, p. 350. Peter Doggett writes of work being delayed for \\"several weeks\\" until McCartney returned \\"a string of messages\\" requesting his approval for Spector to start working on the tapes. Once Lennon, Harrison and Starr became aware that McCartney intended to release his solo album on 17 April 1970, the date was immediately deemed an issue, due to the existing items on the Apple release schedule ‚Äì Let It Be and Starr's own solo debut, Sentimental Journey. On 31 March, Starr went to McCartney's house to tell him personally of the decision to delay the release of McCartney, news to which he reacted badly, dismissing Starr from his home and refusing to cede the date agreed to with Aspinall. Stunned at his bandmate's outburst, Starr relayed the situation to Harrison and Lennon, and McCartney's album was reinstated on the release schedule for 17 April. McCartney's bitterness over this episode contributed to him publicly announcing his departure from the Beatles. He also cited Spector's treatment of some songs on the Let It Be album, particularly \\"The Long and Winding Road\\", as another factor. The chronological relevance of the latter claim is disputed by Starr, however, who stated that, when acetates of the album were sent out for each of the Beatles' approval, on 2 April: \\"We all said yes. Even at the beginning Paul said yes. I spoke to him on the phone, and said, 'Did you like it?' and he said, 'Yeah, it's OK.' He didn't put it down.\\" McCartney's announcement came via a press release distributed to select UK journalists on 9 April, with advance copies of McCartney.Schaffner, pp. 131, 135. The press release took the form of a Q&A; in which McCartney discussed his album and, with Lennon's exit still being withheld from the public (for business reasons),MacDonald, pp. 322, 323. matters pertaining to the Beatles' immediate future. McCartney did not state that the group had broken up, but he talked of his \\"break with the Beatles\\" and having no plans to work with the band in the future; he also emphasised his distance from Klein's management and ruled out the likelihood of ever writing songs with Lennon again.Hertsgaard, pp. 279, 287. Although McCartney said that Apple's press officer, Derek Taylor, submitted the questions, Taylor said that those concerning the Beatles were added by McCartney. Amid the uproar that ensued, McCartney returned to the issue of Spector's work on Let It Be. McCartney had conceived of \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" as a simple piano ballad, but Spector overdubbed orchestral and female choral accompaniment. On 14 April, McCartney sent a letter to Klein demanding that the new instrumentation be reduced, the harp part removed, and added: \\"Don't ever do it again.\\"The Beatles, Anthology, p. 350, (full letter) Arriving twelve days after Spector had distributed the acetates with a request for any of the Beatles to contact him immediately with proposed changes, McCartney's demands went unheeded. Klein claimed to have sent McCartney a telegram in reply to the 14 April letter (McCartney having changed his telephone number without informing Apple), but he received no response. Klein therefore went ahead with the manufacturing of the new Beatles album. McCartney blamed Klein for Spector's involvement, since Klein had brought the producer over to London to work with the Beatles. McCartney resolved to end his ties to Apple and the Beatles, as the only means to extricate himself from Klein. =Aftermath and reaction= Newspapers around the world interpreted McCartney's remarks as an announcement that the band had broken up.Hertsgaard, p. 279.Rodriguez, p. 3. On 10 April, having been among the recipients of the Q&A;, Don Short of The Daily Mirror reported on McCartney's departure from the Beatles under the front-page headline \\"Paul Quits The Beatles\\".Badman, pp. 3‚Äì4.Sounes, p. 266. McCartney's bandmates viewed his announcement as a betrayal, particularly since he had used it to promote his solo album. He was vilified by the group's fans and the press for his perceived role in the break-up. McCartney later said that he did not view his comments in the self-interview as an official announcement. According to Beatles confidant Ray Connolly, McCartney was \\"devastated\\" at the reaction his words had caused. From 10 April, reporters and some of the band's fans began gathering outside the Apple Corps offices at 3 Saville Row. A CBS News team reported that \\"The event is so momentous that historians may, one day, view it as a landmark in the decline of the British Empire ... The Beatles are breaking up.\\" Inside Apple, where he was being filmed for an episode of the BBC1 program Fact or Fantasy?, Harrison refused to speak to the media; after completing the filming, he watched an early edit of the documentary film The Long and Winding Road (later expanded into the 1995 series The Beatles Anthology). Asked for their response to McCartney's comments, Starr said, \\"This is all news to me\\", and Lennon said: \\"It was nice to find that he was still alive. Anyway, you can say I said jokingly, 'He didn't quit, I sacked him!'\\" Taylor issued a press release, which stated in part: > [The Beatles] do not want to split up, but the present rift seems to be part > of their growing up ... at the moment they seem to cramp each other's > styles. Paul has called a halt to the Beatles' activities. They could be > dormant for years ... It is no secret that Klein and Paul have never hit it > off ... He opposed the appointment of Klein and wanted to make his father- > in-law [Lee] Eastman, a New York lawyer, manager. In the 18 April issue of Melody Maker, Richard Williams commented that, since the Q&A; did not categorically state that McCartney had left the Beatles or would never record with them again, \\"What else is new? All these facts existed at the time of Abbey Road, but it didn't stop that album being made.\\" Williams dismissed the news as \\"possibly the non-event of the year\\", since he believed the Beatles would continue as before. In an interview for Rolling Stone that week, Lennon said that it was merely McCartney \\"causing chaos\\" in the same way that he used to \\"sulk\\" if Epstein would not let him have his way. Lennon also said: \\"The cartoon is this ‚Äì four guys on a stage with a spotlight on them; second picture, three guys on stage breezing out of the spotlight; third picture, one guy standing there shouting 'I'm leaving.'\\" In an interview he gave in New York in late April, Harrison stated that, even though he was about to record a solo album with Spector as his producer, it would be \\"very selfish\\" if the Beatles did not put aside their differences and record together again soon, given how much their music meant to listeners around the world. Harrison said that, from its launch in 1968, McCartney had led Apple into financial problems and the others had then had to step in and try to remedy the situation. McCartney was unable to accept that he had less control than before, Harrison continued, and that, with their appointment of Klein, the others were putting the Beatles and Apple first rather than \\"trying to do what's best for Paul and his in-laws\\". Harrison's message that the Beatles would regroup after each member had completed their solo projects was syndicated internationally. Lennon also suggested that he was interested in recording again with the Beatles, saying of the current turn of events: \\"It could be a rebirth or a death. We'll see what it is. It'll probably be a rebirth.\\" High Court suit and public sparring McCartney's wish to dissolve the partnership was problematic, since it would expose them all to enormous tax liability, and his pleas to be released from Apple were ignored by Lennon, Harrison and Starr.Brown & Gaines, pp. 347‚Äì48. McCartney said he struggled all through the summer of 1970 with the idea of having to sue his bandmates in order to be free of Apple and Klein. Anticipating the suit, Klein suggested that the other Beatles invite McCartney to a recording session in October where Lennon and Harrison were due to work on Starr's song \\"Early 1970\\". Klein reasoned that if McCartney attended, it would show that the Beatles' musical partnership was still active and undermine McCartney's case. McCartney did not accept the invitation. In December, Harrison and McCartney met in New York to discuss their differences but the meeting went badly. The press nevertheless interpreted the meeting as a truce between the two parties and, since Lennon was also in New York that month, reports insisted that the Beatles would soon re-form. On 31 December, McCartney filed a lawsuit against the other three Beatles in London's High Court of Justice for dissolution of the band's contractual partnership.Sounes, p. 276. For Beatles fans, news of McCartney's legal action and the publication of Lennon's two-part \\"Lennon Remembers\\" interview in Rolling Stone increased the distasteful atmosphere surrounding the group's demise. Time magazine dubbed the confrontation \\"Beatled√§mmerung\\", in reference to Wagner's opera about a war among the gods. By contrast, according to Guardian journalist Kitty Empire, writing in 2011, Harrison's All Things Must Pass triple album \\"functioned as a kind of repository for grief\\" for the band's fans. In Doggett's description, the Beatles-related songs on Harrison's album \\"offered a teasing glimpse into an intimate world that had previously been off-limits to the public\\", and they introduced a self- referential trait in the ex-Beatles' songwriting that, for fans and the press, came to represent episodes in a public soap opera. The case opened in the Chancery Division of the High Court on 19 January 1971. McCartney's counsel, David Hirst, told the court that the Beatles' finances were in a \\"grave state\\" and outlined the three reasons behind McCartney's claim for dissolution: the group had long ceased working together; in appointing Klein as the band's exclusive business manager, the other Beatles had acted in breach of the partnership deed; and throughout the four years of its existence, McCartney had yet to receive audited accounts of the partnership. On 18 February, the day before proceedings began, the press announced three further reasons: Klein's attempt to postpone the release of McCartney; Klein and ABKCO's altering of \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" without first consulting McCartney; and ABKCO's transferral of the Let It Be film rights from Apple to United Artists without McCartney's approval. During the subsequent proceedings, McCartney's legal team focused on portraying Klein as a disreputable businessman, and McCartney took the stand to state the case that the Beatles had long ceased to be a functioning band and their differences were irreconcilable. The court heard affidavits from Lennon, Harrison and Starr in which they stated their past difficulties of working with McCartney but said that these had largely been surmounted and there was no reason that the band could not continue.Badman, pp. 27‚Äì28. On 12 March, High Court judge Blanshard Stamp found in McCartney's favour and a receiver was appointed.Sounes, pp. 277‚Äì29. McCartney released his second album, Ram, in May. It included a riposte to \\"Lennon Remembers\\" with the song \\"Too Many People\\", in which, he told Playboy in 1984, he addressed Lennon's \\"preaching\\". Lennon detected other examples of McCartney attacking him within the album's lyrics and responded with the song \\"How Do You Sleep?\\" Harrison and Starr (the latter a non- participant) joined Lennon for the recording of \\"How Do You Sleep?\\", which was released on Lennon's Imagine album in September. Lennon and McCartney continued their public feud through the letters page of Melody Maker, with some of Lennon's correspondence requiring censorship by the magazine's editor. McCartney later wrote \\"Dear Friend\\", a truce offering to Lennon, and included it on the album Wild Life with his band, Wings, in December. Legal dissolution The subsequent negotiations were lengthy as McCartney continued to demand his freedom from the Beatles and Apple, yet his own advisors were now giving him the same warnings regarding the potential tax liability as Klein had identified. The other Beatles soon came to doubt Klein's ability to negotiate a successful settlement with McCartney, given the pair's ongoing antipathy; they were also disillusioned with Klein for his mismanagement of Harrison's Bangladesh aid project, and Lennon felt betrayed by Klein's lack of support for his and Ono's increasingly political music. Lennon, Harrison and Starr formally severed their ties with Klein in March 1973, initiating a wave of lawsuits in London and New York. In November, they sued Klein for misrepresentation and breach of fiduciary duty. Klein then countersued Apple for $19 million in unpaid fees. The cases were settled out of court in January 1977 with Apple paying Klein $5,009,200, equivalent to approximately ¬£2.9 million at the time. Klein credited the \\"tireless efforts and Kissinger-like negotiating brilliance of Yoko Ono Lennon\\" in achieving a settlement to his satisfaction. With Klein no longer managing Apple, the four former bandmates were able to work cooperatively towards a settlement. This document, known as \\"The Beatles Agreement\\",Badman, p. 139. was signed by the four in December 1974. Photographer Bob Gruen recalled Lennon's bemusement at the length and intricacy of the settlement document, saying: \\"He told me that the original agreement between Klein and the Beatles had been two or three paragraphs on a single piece of paper. Now it was going to take an eighty-seven-page document to dissolve.\\" The formal dissolution of the partnership took place in London on 9 January 1975. Partial and attempted reunions in the 1970s During the 1970s, the band members occasionally collaborated, but never with all four Beatles simultaneously. In a 1971 interview, Lennon stated that he could not foresee working with McCartney again, however, \\"Maybe about a year or two after all the money thing's settled, we might have dinner or forget about it.\\" He was nonetheless willing to collaborate with Harrison and Starr; Harrison and Starr often performed on each other's records and separately on Lennon's. McCartney opted against using the pool of session musicians favoured by his bandmates and commented: \\"I felt that it was a bit too predictable, that everyone would leave the Beatles and go with old Phil Spector, or the drummer Jim Keltner. It was like a clique, and I just didn't want to join that clique.\\" Harrison at the Concert for Bangladesh, August 1971 In 1971, Harrison invited his former bandmates to perform with him at the Concert for Bangladesh in August. Starr accepted, but Lennon and McCartney did not. McCartney refused because he was wary of Klein potentially taking the credit for having organised a Beatles reunion. Lennon agreed on the condition that Ono could also participate, but Harrison refused to invite Ono on the grounds that the concert was intended as an exclusive gathering of rock stars, not an avant- garde festival. Following the concert, much of the media attention was focused on the ostensible reunion of Starr and Harrison. In March 1973, Harrison joined Lennon, Starr and bassist Klaus Voorman for the recording of \\"I'm the Greatest\\", released on Starr's 1973 album Ringo. To Lennon's distaste, Harrison suggested that they form a group with this line-up. Amid the numerous financial and legal disputes plaguing the foursome, Lennon stated: \\"The only talk about Beatle reunions comes from people at the side of the Beatles who want to put us together and make millions and millions of dollars. And I'm not interested in that, or in playing with the old team again.\\" However, he also said, \\"There's always a chance [of us reuniting]. As far as I can gather from talking to them all, nobody would mind doing some work together again. But if we did do something, I'm sure it wouldn't be permanent. We'd do it just for that moment.\\" At Starr's request, McCartney also appears on Ringo, for the song \\"Six O'Clock\\". This made it the only album to include compositions and performances by all four ex-Beatles, albeit on separate songs after the breakup. Later in 1973, McCartney attempted to organise a reunion as a means of mitigating their collective legal burden. In February 1974, it was widely reported that the Beatles would soon reform, but although all four members were present in Los Angeles the next month, they chose not to meet. During the promotional run for his December album Dark Horse, Harrison remarked: \\"It's all a fantasy, putting the Beatles back together. If we ever do that, it's because everybody is broke. ... Having played with other musicians, I don't think the Beatles were that good ... I'd join a band with John Lennon any day, but I couldn't join a band with Paul. That's not personal, but from a musical point of view.\\" With their business quarrels settled in early 1975, Lennon found himself keen to approach songwriting with McCartney again. McCartney, according to his wife Linda, was likewise \\"desperate to write with John again\\" and invited Lennon to a recording session in New Orleans. By this time, Lennon had separated from Ono and had entered a romantic partnership with May Pang. According to Pang, Ono phoned Lennon at the end of January and \\"told him ... that he should come over to the Dakota. I told him I didn't like him going over there, and he said, 'Stop it!'. He was yelling at me, 'What's your problem? I'll be home by dinner; we'll go have a late dinner, and then we'll make plans to go to New Orleans and see Paul and Linda.'\\" Pang said that when he returned that night, \\"He was a different person about Paul. It wasn't the same. He was saying, 'Oh, you know when Paul and Linda used to visit us? Well, I couldn't stand it.'\\" Lennon subsequently stayed with Ono until his death; he later told Derek Taylor that Linda was repeatedly suggesting that he work with McCartney again, but \\"I can't really see it myself.\\" Entrepreneurial offers A wave of Beatles nostalgia and persistent reunion rumours in the US during the 1970s led several entrepreneurs to make public offers to the Beatles for a reunion concert. * 1974 ‚Äì Promoter Bill Sargent first offered the Beatles $10 million for a reunion concert.

Lennon's murder and Anthology After Lennon's murder in 1980, Harrison tailored the lyrics to his song \\"All Those Years Ago\\" to serve as a personal tribute to Lennon. The song was originally offered to Starr, who plays drums on the basic track, which was recorded prior to Lennon's death. McCartney (along with his Wings bandmates Linda McCartney and Denny Laine) overdubbed backing vocals. In 1994 and 1995, the remaining three reunited for the Anthology project, using the unfinished Lennon demos \\"Free as a Bird\\" and \\"Real Love\\" as a basis for new songs recorded and released as the Beatles. Also attempted were \\"Grow Old with Me\\" and \\"Now and Then\\", by Lennon, and the McCartney/Harrison collaboration \\"All for Love\\". These sessions were marked by tension, particularly between Harrison and McCartney. At the time, Harrison wryly commented that he felt the sessions were \\"just like being back in the Beatles\\", while McCartney later said: \\"George had some business problems and it didn't do a lot for his moods over the last couple of years.

Modern Chinatown now covers a large area around Yaowarat and Charoen Krung Road. It has been the main centre for trading by the Chinese community since they moved from their old site some 200 years ago to make way for the construction of Wat Phra Kaew, the Grand Palace. Nearby is the Phahurat or Little India. The area is bordered by the Chao Phraya River to the south. Yaowarat Road is well known for its variety of foodstuffs, and at night turns into a large \\"food street\\" that draws tourists and locals from all over the city.  History  Chinatown is in one of the oldest areas of Bangkok. It is the result of the resettlement of Chinese on the west bank of Chao Phraya River after King Rama I moved the capital of the kingdom from Thonburi to Rattanakosin. From there Chinese traders operated maritime junk trade between (Siam) and China throughout the Rattanakosin period.Van Roy, Edward. Sampheng: Bangkok's Chinatown Inside Out. Bangkok: Asian Studies Institute of Chulalongkorn University, 2007 By the end of 1891, King Rama V had ordered the construction of many roads, including Yaowarat Road. Chinatown does not consist of only Yaowarat Road, but also includes others such as Charoen Krung Road, Mangkon Road, Songwat Road, Songsawat Road, Ratchawong Road, and Chakkrawat Road. Yaowarat's Sampheng Market is the center of the area. The path of the road is said to resemble a dragon's curvy body, making it an auspicious location for business. Since it was built to avoid the existing cluster of houses of the people according the king's policy. Yaowarat is a road with a length of about 1.5 km (0.93 mi), 20 m (65 ft) wide and takes 8 years to build (1892‚Äì1900). There are many shops selling gold, garments, textiles, stationery, souvenirs, second-hand parts and equipment, electric goods, computer parts, antiques, imported musical instruments and local delicacies. Based on 2002 data, there are 132 gold shops (including nearby), which is considered the area with the most gold shops in the world. Therefore, it was dubbed as \\"Golden Road\\" in tandem \\"Dragon Road\\". Land prices around Yaowarat Road have always been among the most expensive in Bangkok and Thailand due to limited land which is mostly owned by prominent Thai-Chinese families. This road was originally named \\"Yuppharat Road\\" and later changed to \\"Yaowarat Road\\", which means \\"young king\\", in honour to Prince Vajirunhis, the first crown prince of Thailand, who was the first son of King Rama V. Before it was a road it was just rice fields and canals. In 1894, an electric tram car service passed through Charoen Krung and Yaowarat Roads, this service only ceased in 1968. In the pre-World War II, it was regarded as the busiest area in Bangkok, and was the location of the seven-story and nine-story buildings, both of which are the highest buildings in Thailand at that time. Sign of the road Soi Wanit 1 (Sampheng), The main market street On June 3, 1946 King Rama VIII and his younger brother Prince Bhumibol (later King Rama IX) visited Yaowarat and Sampheng by walking from morning until noon. This event is considered an important history of Yaowarat and causing conflicts between Thais and Thais of Chinese descent, including overseas Chinese who live in Thailand to end. Nowadays, every Chinese New Year festival Yaowarat Road will become a venue for great celebrations. The road will be closed for pedestrian street. Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn has always presided over the opening ceremony, and since December 15, 2019 on every Sunday, this road from 07:00 p.m.-12:00 a.m. will be completely closed to become a pedestrian street (only section Chaloem Buri to Ratchawong Intersections). Characteristics Yaowarat is a road with a length of about 1.5 km (0.93 mi) with traffic management as one-way running in opposite directions to the parallel, Charoen Krung Road. Starting from the Odeon Circle near Wat Traimit, or Temple of Golden Buddha, and ending at Wang Burapha Intersection in front of Wang Burapha area in Phra Nakhon District. Transportation Yaowarat Road is served by the BMTA and affiliated's bus lines: 1, 4, 7 (only section Ratchawong to Chakkrawat Roads), 25, 40, 53, 73, 73‡∏Å, 507, 529, 542, and there are four bus stops: Thian Fah Foundation Hospital, Chaloem Buri, Talat Kao (Old Market) and Wat Tuek. The road also served by the Wat Mangkon Station of the MRT Subway, whose Blue Line runs under the nearby Charoen Krung Road.

He was also the founder and owner of the legendary Sigma Sound Studios. Besides being a state of the art recording studio, Sigma Sound was the recording base of Gamble and Huff's Philadelphia International Records. Tarsia's recordings of that time were noteworthy for their clarity and aural definition, achieved years before the digital era. Tarsia took technical courses in high school before taking a position with the research department of Philco Corporation, which lasted for a decade. Later, he became a service technician for various Philadelphia recording studios. Hungry for knowledge, Tarsia would trek to New York City to mix with top audio engineers. Around 1961, he took an audio engineering position with Cameo Parkway Records. Cameo Parkway's artists included Chubby Checker, Frankie Avalon, Fabian, Bobby Rydell, The Orlons, Dee Dee Sharp, The Dovells and Bunny Sigler. In the fall of 1967, Tarsia, the aspiring studio owner, sold his car, house and other personal possessions and purchased a lease on the second floor of the 212 North 12th Street Building (formerly Sound Plus Studios), and upgraded the studio equipment from 2-track to 8-track. Operating as a one-man operation, Sigma Sound opened its doors for business on August 5, 1968.Shepherd, John (2003) Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World: Media, Industry and Society v.1: Media, Industry and Society, Continuum, , p. 670-1 During the 1970s' gold and multi-platinum-laced heyday of 'The Sound Of Philadelphia', the facility became a 24-hour operation, in order to meet the great demand for its services. The studio's success prompted Tarsia to open another studio in nearby New York, named Sigma Sound Studios of New York. It had a client list that included Whitney Houston, Madonna, Billy Joel, Steely Dan, Ashford and Simpson and Paul Simon. In 1990, Tarsia's son Michael Tarsia became president of Sigma. More recently, Joe Tarsia is sharing his vast wealth of knowledge and experience, as lecturer and as a participant in such educational programs as GRAMMY In The Schools. Tarsia closed the New York studio sometime in the early 1990s; and in 2003, sold the original studio in Philadelphia. In 2016, Tarsia was inducted into the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum.

It stands on the seaward shore of the Sciberras Peninsula that divides Marsamxett Harbour from Grand Harbour, and commands the entrances to both harbours along with Fort Tign√© and Fort Ricasoli. It is best known for its role in the Great Siege of Malta of 1565. History =Background and construction= Plan of Fort Saint Elmo. By 1417, the local militia had already established a permanent watch post on the tip of the Sciberras Peninsula. In 1488, the Aragonese built a watchtower on Saint Elmo Point, and it was dedicated to Erasmus of Formia, better known as Saint Elmo. In 1533, the Order of Saint John reinforced the tower due to its strategic location. In 1551, an Ottoman raid occurred in which the Turkish fleet sailed into Marsamxett Harbour unopposed. Due to this, it was decided that a major expansion was necessary, and in 1552 the tower was demolished and a new star fort began to be built. It was designed by a Spanish Engineer named Pietro Pardo.https://www.um.edu.mt/library/oar/bitstream/123456789/51888/30/Orizzont_Dawra%20kulturali%20mal- Port%20il-Kbir%20%2830%29.PDF It had a cavalier, a covertway and a tenaille. A ravelin was hastily constructed months before the 1565 siege. =Great Siege of 1565= In 1565, the Ottomans invaded Malta once again with much more force than in 1551, in the Great Siege of Malta. Fort Saint Elmo was the scene of some of the most intense fighting of this siege, and it withstood massive bombardment from Turkish cannon deployed on Mount Sciberras that overlooked the fort and from batteries on the north arm of Marsamextt Harbour, the present site of Fort Tign√©. The initial garrison of the fort was around one hundred and fifty knights and six hundred soldiers, the majority of whom were Spanish, and sixty armed galley slaves. The garrison could be reinforced by boat from the forts across the Grand Harbour at Birgu and Senglea. The Siege of Malta - Capture of Fort Saint Elmo by Matteo Perez d'Aleccio During the bombardment of the fort, a cannon misfired and hit the top of its parapet, sending shards in all directions. Debris from the impact killed the gunner and mortally injured the corsair and Ottoman admiral Dragut, one of the most competent of the Ottoman commanders. The fort withstood the siege for 28 days, falling to the Turks on 23 June 1565. None of the defending knights survived, and only nine of the Maltese defenders survived by swimming across to Fort St. Angelo on the other side of the Grand Harbour after Fort St Elmo fell. The long siege bought much needed time for the preparation of the other two fortresses and the arrival of reinforcements from Spain. =Reconstruction and modifications= After the siege, Grandmaster Jean Parisot de Valette decided to build a new city on the peninsula. Construction started in 1566, and Francesco Laparelli was sent by the Pope to design the fortifications. The ruined Fort Saint Elmo was rebuilt and integrated within the city walls. The Carafa Enceinte. The towers on top of the bastions are concrete coastal defences built in World War II. The fort was modified a number of times in the 17th century. The Vend√¥me Bastion was built in 1614, and in 1687 the Carafa Enceinte was built on the foreshore surrounding the entire fort. In the late 17th century, the fort was directly linked to the cavalier and part of the ditch was filled in burying some of the original ramparts in the process. In the 18th century, a new polverista was built in the Vendome Bastion, and stores were built in the area between the main fort and the Carafa Enceinte. These are known as Pinto Stores and they and the surrounding area form what is known as Lower Saint Elmo. On 8 September 1775, Fort Saint Elmo was captured by 13 rebel priests along with Saint James Cavalier in what became known as the Revolt of the Priests. The Order's flag was lowered and a banner of Saint Paul was raised instead. The Order managed to recapture St Elmo so the rebels in control of St James surrendered as well. Eventually the rebels were tried and three were executed while the others were exiled or imprisoned. The heads of the three executed men were displayed on the corners of St James Cavalier, but were removed soon after Emmanuel de Rohan-Polduc was elected Grandmaster in November of the same year. =British rule= The fort was once again modified in the early 19th century by the British, when a musketry parapet was built. In 1855, the polverista at Vendome Bastion was converted into an armoury, and some small arms from the Palace Armoury were transferred there. In the 1870s, more works were done on Abercrombie's Bastion. In 1917, the first heart operation to be performed on a soldier was done at St Elmo. In the interwar period gun emplacements were built to house new twin 6-pounder QF guns. The fort was the site of the first aerial bombardment of Malta on 11 June 1940. Among the people that were in the fort during the air raid was the military doctor ƒäensu Tabone, who later became President of Malta. He survived the attack, but six others were killed in the same air raid. On 26 July 1941, the Italians launched a seaborne attack on the Grand Harbour with two human torpedoes, four MAS boats and six MT boats. The force was detected early on by a British radar facility, and the coastal artillery at Saint Elmo opened fire when the Italians approached to close range. Fifteen of the attackers were killed and 18 captured, and all the human torpedoes and MT boats, along with two of the MAS boats were lost. One of the MT boats hit St. Elmo Bridge, which linked the breakwater with the tip of the peninsula near the fort, and the bridge collapsed. The bridge was never restored, and it was only in 2012 that a new one was built in its place with a similar but different design. Parts of the fort were severely damaged during the war and some scars of the bombing can still be seen to this day.https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/when-war- came-to-malta-and-thousands-became-refugees.797724 The Royal Malta Artillery left the fort on 26 March 1972, ending its long military history. Parts of the fort subsequently fell in disuse. Present day In Guardia parade at St Elmo The World Monuments Fund placed the fort on its 2008 Watch List of the 100 Most Endangered Sites in the world because of its significant deterioration due to factors such as lack of maintenance and security, natural aging, and exposure to the elements. Since 2009 major restoration works began, and as of 2014 the restoration of Upper Saint Elmo and the Carafa enceinte was nearly complete. Restoration work was completed in 2015. Lower Saint Elmo has been cleaned from the waste that accumulated over the years, and the Grand Harbour Regeneration Corporation is making plans to begin restoration. Interior of Fort Saint Elmo after restoration and inauguration as a museum From 1975, part of the fort housed the National War Museum, which contained military equipment and other things related to World War I and II. A replica of the George Cross that was awarded to Malta by King George VI in April 1942, was also on display in this museum. The museum closed in September 2014, and reopened in May 2015 having a larger collection. Since the mid-20th century, Fort Saint Elmo has also housed Malta's police academy. Other parts of the fort are used for In Guardia and Alarme military reenactments. While the fort was being restored, some archaeological excavations were made and various elements of the original pre-1565 fort were uncovered. This was an important find because little of the original fort exists, mainly because Laparelli rebuilt it in 1566 and it underwent a lot of renovation between the 17th and 19th centuries. In November 2015 the fort was used as a media centre for the Valletta Summit on Migration. Foreign journalists stated that it was possibly \\"the most stunning venue which ever hosted an EU summit\\". Layout Left Demi-Bastion of Fort St. Elmo, before restoration Fort St. Elmo after restoration The original star fort, sometimes known as Upper St. Elmo to distinguish it from the rest of the fort, consists of two demi-bastions, two flanks and two faces, a parade ground, barracks and a large cavalier. The fort included a ravelin in 1565, but this was demolished during the fort's reconstruction after the siege. A gate known as the Porta del Soccorso serves as the main entrance to Upper St. Elmo. The 15th-century Chapel of St Anne is located within the fort's walls close to this gate, and the 18th-century Church of St Anne is found within the parade ground. After the fortifications of Valletta were built, Vend√¥me Bastion was constructed in 1614 linking the French Curtain to Fort St. Elmo. The bastion contains an echaugette, and it was eventually converted into a magazine, and later an armoury. The bastion is now part of the National War Museum. The Carafa Enceinte, which was built starting from 1687, encloses the original fort as well as Vend√¥me Bastion. It consists of the following bastions and curtain walls: *St. Gregory Bastion ‚Äì an asymmetrical bastion with a long left face. It was altered by the British to house QF 6 pounder 10 cwt guns. *St. Gregory Curtain ‚Äì a curtain wall linking St. Gregory and Conception Bastions.

Sir Alexander Ball was buried in the salient of the bastion. *Sta. Scholastica Curtain ‚Äì curtain wall linking Conception and St. John Bastions. It contains a gun emplacement for a RML 12.5 inch 38 ton gun, as well as other British modifications. *St. John Bastion, also known as Abercrombie's Bastion ‚Äì a large asymmetrical bastion at St. Elmo Point, the tip of the Sciberras Peninsula. The bastion contains several British gun emplacements and magazines. Sir Ralph Abercromby was buried on the bastion. *St. Ubaldesca Curtain, also known as Abercrombie's Curtain ‚Äì a long curtain wall linking St. John and St. Lazarus Bastions. It contains a number of British gun emplacements. Some barrack blocks are located in the area between Upper St. Elmo and the Carafa Enceinte. In popular culture *Lower Saint Elmo was used as a film location for the Turkish jail in the 1978 film Midnight Express. *Fort St Elmo is featured in the 2011 historical novel, Eight Pointed Cross by Marthese Fenech and will be a prominent setting in the sequel, which is currently being written. *The fort is mentioned in the 1980 thriller novel Man on Fire by A.

It was constructed in 1430 for Sir William Borthwick, from whom the castle takes its name,Scott 1834, p.196Chambers 1828, p.100 Panoramic views of the castle can be seen from the Borders Railway between Edinburgh Waverley and Tweedbank railway stations. History The east wall, damaged in 1650 The castle was built at the site of an earlier structure, and it remains the Borthwick family ancestral seat. Sir William Borthwick, later the 1st Lord, obtained from King James I on 2 June 1430 a licence to erect on the Mote of Locherwart, a castle or fortalice.Scott 1834, p.197 This was unusual in Scotland as nobles generally did not need to get permission for the building and fortifying of a Castle.Scott 1834, p.198 He acquired a large part of Locherworth from his neighbour William Hay who was resentful of this and jealous of his neighbour's castle.Scott 1834, p.200 The well-preserved medieval effigies of the builder and his lady can be seen in the nearby parish kirk of St Kentigern, which retains a 15th-century aisle also probably built by him. It was originally a stone enclosure fortress centring on an unusually tall tower house with walls up to thick and in height. The design is a 'U-shaped' keep with a gap between the projecting, slightly asymmetrical, towers. There was a surrounding defensive courtyard with round towers pierced with shot-holes at the corners. While the tower house itself is exceptionally well preserved for its date, the surrounding wall and towers are much restored. Borthwick Castle was visited twice by Mary, Queen of Scots, in 1563 and 1567, the latter occasion when she and her new husband, James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell, were besieged inside while under the protection of 6th Lord Borthwick. After marrying on 15 May 1567, the couple fled to Borthwick, and later escaped the siege, Mary, disguising herself as a page.Tytler 1840, p.128 However, the queen was soon arrested and taken to Lochleven castle where she was held in captivity. Bothwell fled to Orkney and Shetland, and from there escaped to Norway, which at the time was under Danish rule. \\"The king of Denmark kept him in prison as a useful pawn, first in Malm√∂, then in Dragsholm on Zealand, where he died insane. His embalmed body is preserved in a crypt in the church at Faarvejle nearby.\\" James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell, husband of Mary, Queen of Scots from 15 May 1567 to his death in 14 April 1578. In 1650 the Castle was attacked by Oliver Cromwell's forces, and was surrendered after only a few cannon shots. The damage to the walls from this attack is still visible.Scott 1834, p.211 After a period of abandonment, the Castle was restored by 1914. During World War II the structure was used as a hiding place to store national treasures. In 1973 it was leased from the Borthwick family and converted into an exclusive hire venue. In June 2013, the castle closed for extensive refurbishment, and once again opened as an events venue in September 2015. Building The castle in the late 18th century Borthwick Castle is built as a double tower, long, in breadth and high. The castle is on a small hill surrounded by a stream. Apart from the large cannon scar on one face, the walls, built of fine sandstone ashlar, are virtually complete, and very unusually, none of the original narrow windows have been enlarged. The battlements, however, no longer survive to their original height, having lost their stepped crenelations. They are carried on massive projecting corbels with corner roundels. The tower has two doorways, both unaltered and round headed. One at ground level leads into the partly subterranean kitchen and storage vaults. The second is directly above it at first-floor level, and leads directly into the stone-vaulted great hall. It is approached by a reconstructed stone bridge. =Great Hall= The Great hall of Borthwick Castle is long and of great height.

She describes her nationality as Palestinian. Fahima was born in Kiryat Gat, a development town in the south of Israel, to a family of Algerian Jewish and Moroccan Jewish origin.Tali Fahima's Journey to Islam - The Sisterhood She was one of three daughters born to Sarah Lahiani and Shimon Fahima. After her parents divorced, Fahima and her sisters were raised by their mother, who worked in a variety of jobs to support them. After completing her mandatory military service, Fahima moved to Tel Aviv and worked as a legal secretary.The outsider Until 2003 she was a Likud supporter; she then read an interview in which Zubeidi described his transformation from peace activist to wanted terrorist; intrigued, she found Zubeidi's phone number, and spoke with him several times. When she learned that Zubeidi was at the top of Israel's list of intended assassinations, she decided to travel to Jenin and live in his home as a human shield. She became involved in the Palestinian children's project in Jenin which featured in the film Arna's Children, along with Zubeidi before his imprisonment. She did not deny that she later met Zubeidi in Jenin a number of times, but she denied any involvement in armed activities. In March 2004 she stated that she was prepared to act as a human shield to protect Zubeidi. Both she and Zubeidi deny the allegation that they had a romantic relationship. On 8 August 2004, Fahima was arrested, interrogated by security officials for one month and then placed under administrative detention for three months. She was indicted in December 2004 and charged with \\"assistance to the enemy at time of war\\". On 23 December 2005 she pleaded guilty to some less serious charges, admitting to maintaining contacts with a foreign agent with the intention of harming state security. She also admitted to passing information to the enemy, and to violating a legal order forbidding the entry of Israelis into Palestinian Authority-controlled territory. The most serious charges, aiding an enemy in time of war, supporting a terrorist organization and possession of weapons against her were dropped. She received a three-year prison sentence and a suspended sentence that would go into effect if she violated any order forbidding entry into closed military zones, leaving less than one year of prison time left to serve. Her first request for early release was denied, the Parole Board ruling on 13 September 2006, that she \\"acted in an insolent and rude manner toward prison guards\\". She was released in early January 2007, a year earlier than her original sentence, for good conduct. She was banned from leaving the country, contacting foreign agents or entering the Palestinian- controlled areas in the West Bank On 23 April 2007, Fahima participated in an alternative torch-lighting ceremony for Israeli Independence Day, where she lit a torch in honor of Zubeidi. In June 2008, Zubaidi, confined to Jenin in an amnesty agreement requested permission to travel to Ramallah for an eye operation; leading Fahima to denounce him as a \\"whore of the Shin Bet security service.\\" Fahima lives in the Arab village Ar'ara in northern Israel, and works as a Hebrew teacher. In June 2010, she converted to Islam at a mosque in Umm al-Fahm.Left-wing activist Tali Fahima converts to Islam References External links * \\"Israel jails Jewish woman for meeting Palestinian militant\\", The Guardian * Leftist Tali Fahima converts to Islam in Yedioth Ahronoth * \\"Interview with Tali Fahima\\" from Oznik *Tali Fahima's video blog on Flix, Tapuz *\\"Mizrahi Woman, Palestinian Fighter: The Public Discourse Surrounding the Struggle of Tali Fahima.\\" MA Tesis on \\"Kedma\\".

Its leader was Stefano Belisari, better known as Elio. They announced their split on 17 October 2017, on Italian TV program Le Iene. Elio e le Storie Tese acquired national fame after their second-place finish at the Sanremo Music Festival 1996 with the song \\"La terra dei cachi\\", a humorous take on Italian lifestyle. They also won the Critics' Award \\"Mia Martini\\" for their performance. In 1999, they were awarded as Best Italian Act at the MTV Europe Music Awards, and in 2003 they won the Best Italian Videoclip award at the Italian Music Awards of Federazione Industria Musicale Italiana for \\"Shpalman¬Æ\\". In 2011, they were elected as the best group band of the 2001‚Äì2010 decade through a referendum announced by the website Rockol. In 2012, the album Elio samaga hukapan kariyana turu has been ranked the 15th best Italian album of all time by the magazine Rolling Stone. The group participated to the Sanremo Music Festival for the second time in the 2013 edition with the song \\"La canzone mononota\\", achieving again the second place and winning the Critics' Award \\"Mia Martini\\" for the second time, the award for the best arrangement and the Radio and TV Press-Room award. History The origins of Elio e le Storie Tese go back to the 1970s, when Stefano Belisari (Elio), Luca Mangoni and Marco Conforti (Sergio's brother and future manager of the group) were classmates in a high school in Milan. The first line-up debuted in Milan in 1980. It consisted of Elio on guitar, Paolo Cortellino on bass and Pier Luigi Zuffellato on drums. Cortellino was then replaced firstly by Fabio Gianvecchio (Chiosco), later by Dario Mazzoli (Scaffale), and finally, in 1986, by Nicola Fasani (Faso). In the meantime, Zuffellato had left the group, and was replaced by Vittorio Cosma until 1982, when, after EelST were joined by the pianist Sergio Conforti (Rocco Tanica), the role of drummer was filled by a Drumulator operated by Rocco Tanica himself until 1988, when a Swiss drummer called Christian Meyer joined the group. At the beginning, Elio was singer and guitarist, but in 1983 the group hired rock guitarist Davide Civaschi (Cesareo). From that moment on, Elio could focus on being the front-man, and, sparingly, play the Western concert flute, for which he had passed the music academy's examination. In 1988, the group was also joined by the multi-instrumentalist Paolo Panigada (Feiez), who died ten years later. In 1992, Elio decided to include architect and former classmate Mangoni in the band. Mangoni, described in the official website as \\"artist and architect\\", would have various roles, such as dancing and singing during live performances. The first studio album, Elio samaga hukapan kariyana turu was published in 1989, and it was followed by The Los Sri Lanka Parakramabahu Brothers Featuring Elio e le Storie Tese (1990), ƒ∞talyan, rum casusu √ßikti (1992), Esco dal mio corpo e ho molta paura: Gli inediti 1979‚Äì1986 (1993), Eat the Phikis (1996), Peerla (1998), Craccracriccrecr (1999), Cicciput (2003), Studentessi (2008) and L'album biango (2013). During their 35-year career, EelST have been awarded several prizes; they came second twice in the Sanremo Music Festival (in (1996 and 2013); they also won two \\"Mia Martini\\" Critics' Awards. In March 2014, Elio e le Storie Tese presented six episodes of Il Musichione, a comedy musical show on Rai 2. On 17 October 2017, the band announced that they would disband at the end of the year, after their last concert in Milan on 19 December. On 16 December 2017, it was announced that the band would take part in the Sanremo Music Festival 2018 with the song Arrivedorci, i.e. \\"Arrivederci\\", meaning \\"See you later\\" in Italian; the song title is misspelled in the same way in which Alberto Sordi intentionally mispronounced the word, with a fake and exaggerated American accent (mostly for comic effect), while dubbing Oliver Hardy in the Italian versions of Laurel and Hardy films, from 1939 to 1951). The song, a slow ballad with a lyric consisting in a half-comical, half-serious concise recapitulation of their history, came last in the final chart and it was called by journalist and music critic Mario Luzzatto Fegiz \\"the ugliest song [they] ever wrote\\"; Elio, replying to Fegiz in an ambiguous attitude, stated that the band had made a calculated effort to classify last. A follow-up \\"Tour D'Addio\\" (\\"Farewell Tour\\") was announced for the Spring of 2018 starting on April 20th and ending on June 29th. Later on, during a June 30, 2018 meet-and- greet in Barolo, for the tenth edition of its Collisioni rock music festival, Elio clarified that the main reasons behind the band's break-up were Tanica's recurring and continued absence from their stage performances during the previous years, due to health reasons ‚Äì namely depression (although the keyboardist never gave up his official membership in the band, by continuing to play keyboards and synths on their studio albums) ‚Äì and a general tiredness within the band after their long career. Style Rocco Tanica, Mangoni and Elio The music of the group is openly inspired, among other sources, by the style of Frank Zappa, both in music and lyrics. Elio e le Storie Tese's musical work is characterized by eclecticism and competence, in the melodic, harmonic and orchestration (arrangement) aspects, augmented by the members' technical proficiency. They are widely considered as some of the best musicians in Italy. They are usually joined by an \\"unofficial\\" member, Mangoni (a former schoolmate of Elio and actually an architect), whose role is to dance, make choreographies or even sing during live shows on stage. In their official discography, and in their gigs, EelST have covered many of the genres typified in popular music: rock, Latin, progressive rock, disco and soul, to name a few. A very strong attitude to affectionately mock and modify to their needs the clich√®s of Italian pop music has always been part of their musical career, and nonetheless many Italian pop artists have been proud guests in their recordings, acknowledging their value. Their songs are typically interspersed by a rude, coarse humour which lies in stark contrast to their extreme varied and competent musical talent; once the band was considered part of the 'demential' rock underground spawned after the demise of punk and cross-fertilized by situationist dadaism, but they have soared well past above that scene. One of their favourite themes is adolescent life, seen as a golden period of fun, friendship, music and sexual discoveries. The band has also been the first one, in 2004, to sell instant CDs of their live performances immediately after their end (which they dubbed CD brul√©, as they were 'burned' on the spot, like mulled wine, in Italian \\"vin brul√©\\").

Norman is regarded as Sweden's leading boogie-woogie piano player in the 1940s, but also an accomplished all- round pianist. He collaborated with other artists such as Alice Babs and Sickan Carlsson. He wrote scores for a number of films and also starred as an actor in several. His boogie-woogie version of Edvard Grieg's Anitra's Dance earned him some notoriety in Norway.  Early life  Born in Ludvika in central Sweden, Norman became interested in music at an early age and played the trumpet in his school orchestra. At the time, he was also studying the piano. Norman's parents did not want him to take up a career as a musician without first learning, what they considered, a more a proper trade. To please his parents, he began work as a lathe operator at ASEA. In his spare time he started a dance orchestra where he played the piano. His dance orchestra entered a competition in Borl√§nge in 1937. Norman's prowess as a pianist was recognized and he was invited to join the Sven Fors Orchestra. Norman got his first professional job as a musician in the summer of 1937, with the Sven Fors Orchestra at the Societetsrestaurangen (\\"High Society Restaurant\\") in Varberg. He made his radio debut in 1938. After that, he worked with orchestra leaders such as H√•kan von Eichwald and Seymour √ñsterwall. In 1942, Norman contracted tuberculosis and had to be hospitalized for an extended period of time. While in hospital, Norman began to write arrangements for recording sessions and also prepared a correspondence course in arrangement for dance orchestras. In 1949, he married Dagny Knutsson. They had a son Lennie and a daughter Lena.  Career  At the beginning of 1940, Norman was already a skilled boogie-woogie pianist and this musical genre became the most popular of his compositions and it also became his signature. The boogie-woogie style he played in was a success when his first record, Charlies Boogie, was released in 1941. When Norman re-arranged Edvard Grieg's classical \\"Anitras Dance\\" and renamed it \\"Anitras Dance Boogie\\" in 1949, it resulted in a major controversy. The Grieg Foundation in Norway were outraged and said that the performance \\"violated Grieg's artistic copyright\\" and his record company, Metronome, was forced to withdraw the remaining copies. By then the record had already sold in excess of 10,000 copies and the \\"Anitras Dance Boogie\\" became one of the most requested pieces in Norman's repertoire. Charlie Norman at the piano with Alice Babs and guitarist Roffe Berg in Sikforsen, 19 August 1954. During the 1940s, Norman made several appearances abroad, including his television debut in Paris in 1947, on a program that also featured the legendary √âdith Piaf. In 1949, Norman put together an orchestra to entertain US military personnel at the officer's club in Frankfurt. Starting in 1950, Norman reached a larger audience through his radio shows. He hosted the radio series the Nattugglan (The Night Owl) followed by The Charlie Norman Show and Charlie In School. In 1951, Norman formed a trio with Rolf Berg and Hasse Burman that toured and performed at a number of venues. Norman made many recordings with Swedish singer Alice Babs and one of these resulted in Sweden's first gold record. His collaboration with Babs became successful and lasted for years. In 1990, Norman successfully persuaded her to make a comeback after her lengthy retirement to Spain. Norman was one of the artists in the popular radio program Dagens Revy (Today's Revue) along with G√∂sta Bernhard, Sickan Carlsson and Stig J√§rrel. In television, Norman contributed to children's programs and the family program Small Town. He wrote many film scores, for both short films and full-length features such as The Pot Travel, You've made your bed... and Dangerous Freedom. He also wrote the score for the American television series, Foreign Intrigue of which 50 episodes were shown in Sweden. In addition to being a skilled pianist, Norman also had an excellent sense of humour and he has often been compared to Victor Borge. He wrote most of the material he used in shows. During the 1970s and 1980s Norman teamed up with his son, comedian Lennie Norman and Ronnie Gardiner for ten winter seasons on the Canary Islands where they entertained Swedish tourists. Norman also appeared in restaurant shows at the Berns and Bacchi Wapen restaurants in Stockholm, the restaurant Tr√§dg√•rn in Gothenburg and Kronprinsen in Malm√∂. In the 1990s, Norman often played with Robert Wells, a great admirer of Norman's.  Death  Norman died on 12August 2005, in Danderyd, Sweden from skeletal cancer.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Minnesota Twins, Milwaukee Brewers, Tampa Bay Devil Rays / Rays, and Oakland Athletics. He is the all-time save leader and strikeout leader among Australian MLB pitchers, and holds the Oakland Athletics consecutive save record at 44. Background Notable as one of only a handful of Australian- born Major League Baseball players, Balfour spent his first years at school attending Kings Langley Public School and high school years at William Clarke College in Kellyville, New South Wales. Baseball career =Minnesota Twins= Balfour made his major league debut with the Minnesota Twins in and played with them until . =Cincinnati Reds= After missing with an injury, he played in the Cincinnati Reds organization in . =Milwaukee Brewers= After a three-year absence, Balfour made his return to the major leagues on 18 July, , in the 8th inning with the Milwaukee Brewers. He relieved Chris Capuano in a 2‚Äì2 tie with the Arizona Diamondbacks, striking out Chris Young, the first hitter he faced. With two outs in the 8th, he hit a batter and walked another before giving up a three-run home run to Mark Reynolds, giving the Diamondbacks a 5‚Äì2 lead. Balfour would finish the 8th and 9th inning and take the loss in relief, having given up three earned runs in the 5‚Äì2 defeat. =Tampa Bay Rays= The Brewers designated Balfour for assignment on 27 July 2007, and traded him to the Tampa Bay Rays that day for Seth McClung. He finished the season in the Rays' bullpen and was re-signed to a one-year deal. He came into spring training as a long shot to make the Rays' bullpen. Despite a solid spring training, he eventually lost for on the final spot and was designated for assignment. He cleared waivers and accepted an outright assignment to Durham on 3 April 2008. He was recalled from Triple-A Durham on 29 May 2008. He earned a save on 31 May against the Chicago White Sox, retiring Brian Anderson to end the game in a Rays 2‚Äì0 win. In a series sweep against the Chicago Cubs at Tropicana Field, he was credited with two of the three wins ‚Äì the first on 16 June, relieving Scott Kazmir with the score 1‚Äì1 and bases loaded, pitching perfect innings in a 3‚Äì2 win; the second on 18 June, entering the game trailing 1‚Äì2, and pitching innings, recording three strikeouts, in a game the Rays won 8‚Äì3. He finished 2008 with a 1.54 ERA, a 6‚Äì2 record, 4 saves out of 5 opportunities, 14 holds, and 82 strikeouts over IP in 51 appearances. He helped the Rays win their first divisional title and American League pennant (against the Boston Red Sox), losing to the Phillies in the World Series, In 2009, he chose to skip the 2009 World Baseball Classic because the Rays asked him not to play for Australia while he was still under contract. That season was much less successful for the Rays, who finished 84‚Äì78, 19 games behind the New York Yankees. Although he pitched considerably more innings and games pitched, he finished a disappointing 5‚Äì4, with 4 saves and a 4.81 ERA for the season with 69 strikeouts compared to the previous season's 82. Balfour is known to shout at himself while on the mound and use profanity to fire himself up. On 2 October 2008, during Game 1 of the ALDS, he was involved in an exchange of words with Chicago White Sox shortstop Orlando Cabrera. With the bases loaded and two outs, his first pitch to Cabrera was outside for ball one. Cabrera then kicked the dirt in front of the batter's box in the direction of the pitcher's mound and according to Balfour, Cabrera told him to \\"throw it over the plate.\\" Unaware of Balfour's behavior while pitching, Cabrera was under the impression that he was the one being yelled at. The at-bat continued and ended with Cabrera striking out. Balfour stormed off the mound, yelling at Cabrera as he walked to the dugout. Balfour stated after the game that he told Cabrera to \\"go sit down\\" and that he \\"might have mixed one or two words in with it.\\" Deemed a misunderstanding between the two, there were no further incidents in the series, with Balfour getting the final out as the Rays won three games to one. In December 2009, he signed a new contract with Tampa Bay, worth $2.05 million over one year. =Oakland Athletics= On 18 January 2011, Balfour signed a 2-year, $8 million contract with the Oakland Athletics. On 20 March 2012, he was named the Athletics' closer over Brian Fuentes. Balfour held the closer role for the early part of the 2012 season but was demoted after a few blown saves to the role of setup man. In early August, Balfour regained the closer role from Ryan Cook. Balfour went 3‚Äì2 in 75 appearances with 24 saves in innings pitched in 2012. On 29 October, the Athletics decided to exercise their option for Balfour worth $4.5M. On 8 July 2013, Balfour set the record for most consecutive saves for the Athletics, earning his 41st in a 2‚Äì1 win over the Pittsburgh Pirates. He was selected later in the month as a replacement All-Star pitcher for teammate Bartolo Col√≥n. In 65 appearances, Balfour finished the year 38‚Äì41 in save opportunities, going 1‚Äì3 with a 2.59 ERA as the team's closer, striking out 72 in 62.2 innings with a .206 OBA. He pitched three scoreless innings in the ALDS against the Tigers, getting one win and one save. In Game 3 of the 2013 ALDS against the Detroit Tigers, Balfour began cursing at Victor Martinez, who then answered back, leading to both benches clearing. Balfour claimed that Martinez gave him a \\"viral death stare\\" prior to exchanging words as he composed it on Twitter. The A's would go on to win the game 6-3 but lost the series in 5 games. =Second stint with the Tampa Bay Rays= On 17 December 2013, Balfour came to an agreement with the Baltimore Orioles on a two-year $15 million deal. However, on 19 December 2013, it was revealed that the deal was in serious jeopardy as a result of issues that came up during his physical. On 20 December, the Orioles announced that they would not be signing him and that they would look elsewhere for relief help. Balfour responded that he was perfectly healthy and other doctors who examined him disputed the Orioles interpretation of his physical results. He said he would consider filing a grievance with the players association. Balfour subsequently agreed to a two-year contract with the Rays, worth $12 million. After starting the 2014 season with a 6.46 ERA in 24 games, Balfour was removed from the closer role on 9 June 2014. He was designated for assignment by the Rays on 18 April 2015, and released on 29 April. Several days after the team released him, Balfour signed a minor league deal back with the Rays. While pitching with Triple-A Durham, Balfour held a 2.79 ERA in eight games, owning an 11:4 K:BB ratio over 9 2/3 innings. He opted out of his contract on 28 May. On 29 April 2016, Balfour announced his retirement. Personal life Balfour's father, David, was a rugby player and general manager and owner of the Sydney Blue Sox. David was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2010 and died on 10 March 2015. Balfour was inducted into the Baseball Australia Hall of Fame in February 2015.

Silver, at the time, was also Cosby's manager. The term \\"Tetragrammaton\\" refers to the unspeakable Hebrew name of God.Thedeadrockstarsclub.com - accessed August 2010 The label's most successful act was the rock band Deep Purple. History Tetragrammaton was also responsible for releasing the controversial 1968 Apple Records album, Unfinished Music No. 1: Two Virgins in the United States. This avant-garde album was recorded by John Lennon and Yoko Ono and featured nude photos of the pair on the front and back cover. Tetragrammaton stepped in as distributor after Capitol Records, the usual US distributor for Apple and the Beatles, refused the album, citing a possible negative response from retailers. The Lennon/Ono album was also declared to be pornography by some authorities. Tetragrammaton quickly fell into financial difficulties related in part to their distribution of this album. Approximately 30,000 copies of the record were seized by police at a warehouse in New Jersey. The records were held as evidence in a court case, which made it impossible for the label to sell them at the time. Bill Cosby's 1969 stand-up comedy album, 8:15 12:15, was also released by the label, as were two albums by comedian Murray Roman, You Can't Beat People Up & Have Them Say I Love You and A Blind Man's Movie. A number of the label's projects were left unissued. Among these were a second album by singer songwriter Elyse Weinberg, and an album by Memphis musician Captain Milk (real name, Edwin Hubbard) who described himself as a \\"flute picker\\". Tetragrammaton did however release a single of the Lennon/McCartney song Hey Jude from the Captain Milk recording sessions. An English rock band named Bodast also recorded an unreleased album for Tetragrammaton in 1968. The group featured guitarist Steve Howe, later a member of Yes. The Bodast recordings were first released in 1981 by Cherry Red Records. Despite having several popular artists on its roster, Tetragrammaton ceased trading after declaring bankruptcy in 1970. In 1972, Deep Purple's new label, Warner Bros. Records (also Cosby's former label), reissued various tracks from the group's first three Tetragrammaton albums on one compilation album entitled Purple Passages. In Canada, some of Tetragrammaton's releases were manufactured and distributed by the Canadian division of Polydor Records, which also issued several Canada- only Deep Purple compilations after Tetragrammaton's demise. Tetragrammaton's co-founder, Marvin Deane, died of heart failure on August 16, 2010, in Los Angeles, California.

He was a founding member of MFSB, the Philadelphia studio band, and one of the Baker-Harris-Young record production trio. Career Harris was a leading arranger for Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff's Philadelphia International Records label in its early years during the 1970s and played guitar on many recording sessions.

He later founded his own production company in the mid-1970s called The Harris Machine. In 1980, he released his only solo album, The Harris Machine, on Philadelphia International. Harris started teaching himself guitar in his teens and began his career in local clubs, often with bassist Ronnie Baker and later drummer Earl Young, and in the house band at the Uptown Theatre in Philadelphia. He then became a session musician as the Philadelphia recording scene expanded. He later arranged and produced soul and R&B; acts during the late 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, including Blue Magic (with whom he had his biggest success, \\"Sideshow\\", a No. 1 R&B; hit), The Trammps, First Choice, The Dells, The Four Tops, The Temptations, The Whispers, Eddie Kendricks, Barbara Mason, Curtis Mayfield, Bunnie Sigler, Joe Simon, South Shore Commission, Exuctive Suite, and his cousin, Major Harris, a former member of The Delfonics.

It is on two lines: the Arbatsko‚ÄìPokrovskaya line and the Kalininsko‚ÄìSolntsevskaya line. At underground, according to the official figures, it is the deepest metro station in Moscow and one of the deepest in the world (after Kyiv Metro's Arsenalna, Chongqing Rail Transit's Hongtudi station and Saint Petersburg Metro's Admiralteyskaya).  Services  Northern platform The Arbatsko‚ÄìPokrovskaya line serves the station with trains running from Pyatnitskoye Shosse in the northwest via Park Pobedy and central Moscow to Shchyolkovskaya in the northeast of the city. Until 16 March 2017, the Kalininsko‚ÄìSolntsevskaya line's western section has only two stations, Park Pobedy and Delovoy Tsentr. An extension to the south, opened on that day, connected Park Pobedy first with Ramenki via two other stations. Eventually it is planned to be extended to Rasskazovka, near Vnukovo International Airport. Park Pobedy allows cross-platform interchange between the two lines across the station's two island platforms.  History  Construction began in 1986. The initial plans envisaged connections from the Arbatsko‚ÄìPokrovskaya line to the future Mitino‚ÄìButovskaya and the Solntsevo‚ÄìMytischinskaya Chordal lines. The former was accommodated in the station's design, with two additional tracks included parallel to those of the Arbatsko‚ÄìPokrovskaya line (the latter would have used a third set of track perpendicular to these). However, the 1990s financial crises ended the Chordal projects; the station opened in 2003 as a terminus of the Arbatsko‚ÄìPokrovskaya line, and in 2008 the Strogino‚ÄìMitino extension of the Arbatsko‚ÄìPokrovskaya line was begun from Park Pobedy. The second set of tracks saw their first use on 31 January 2014 as part of the Kalininsko‚ÄìSolntsevskaya line's partial service to Delovoy Tsentr.  Design  This is the only Moscow metro station where all passengers board and alight trains in different locations. A further complication was that only the southern, or inbound, platform had an entrance vestibule, so passengers arriving at the northern, or outbound, platform had to change platforms to leave the station. This, however, changed in March 2017, when the southern platform was connected directly to the entrance by a new escalator tunnel.http://welcome2018.com/en/journal/materials/v-moskve-otkrylis-tri- novye-stantsii-metro/ The main reason for this was the opening of new section of Kalininsko-Solntsevskaya line, which now terminates at Ramenki instead of Park Pobedy. At underground, Park Pobedy is the deepest station in Moscow and the fourth-deepest in the world by mean depth, after Kyiv Metro's , Chongqing Rail Transit's Hongtudi station and Saint Petersburg Metro's Admiralteyskaya, and is the deepest station by maximum depth, .Park Pobedy, 165th Station of the Moscow metro at news.metro.ru It also contains the longest escalators in Europe, each one is long and has 740 steps. The escalator ride to the surface takes approximately three minutes. The two platforms, the work of architects Nataliya Shurygina and Nikolay Shumakov, are of identical design but have opposite colour schemes. The pylons of the outbound platform are faced with red marble on the transverse faces and pale grey marble on the longitudinal faces. The inbound platform is the exact reverse. The station is adorned with two large mosaics by Zurab Tsereteli depicting the 1812 French Invasion of Russia (at the end of the inbound platform) and World War II (on the outbound platform). The station has a unique structural design. Instead of traditional cast iron tunnel lining Park Pobedy lining included steel blocks filled with concrete. It significantly reduced amount of structural metal and consequentially overall cost of construction.

The portion of the estate north of Green Lane and Bishopsford Road is in Merton, the remainder is in Sutton. History The site of the St Helier estate has been connected to long-term charity since the early 17th century. Henry Smith (d. 1627) was a wealthy citizen and salter of London who gave much money to parishes in London and Surrey during his lifetime and in his will. He is buried in Wandsworth parish church and is supposed to have been born in Wandsworth. In 1617 he gave ¬£500 towards the purchase of land in Carshalton, the rent of which was to support the poor of Wandsworth. Another ¬£100 bequest came from Mrs. Elizabeth Blackwell. In 1814 the lands were described as being just over 116 acres and having a building, barn and outhouses. The Wandsworth Poor Lands lay on either side of Wrythe Lane at the southernmost part of the St. Helier estate footprint. Another local benefactor was Christopher Muschamp, who died in 1660 and is buried at All Saints, Carshalton. He bequeathed ¬£200 to buy land, the yearly rental of which was to purchase apprenticeships for two poor children who had been born in the parish. Pasture land was bought from Henry Byne in Cannon Sheephouse Lane, which is now known as Green Wrythe Lane. Like the adjoining Sutton Common, most of the area remained semi-rural until the early 20th century. The estate was built between 1928 and 1936 by the London County Council as an overspill estate for the re-housing of people from decaying inner London areas. It was designed as a garden city, with landscaping by the landscape architect Edward Prentice Mawson. Development was spurred by the opening of Morden Underground station in 1926, and the Wimbledon to Sutton railway line in 1930, with a station at St Helier. These services provided rapid links into central London for the residents. The art deco entrance of St Helier Hospital floodlit at night The estate was named in honour of Lady St Helier, who was an LCC Alderman from 1910 to 1927. It was the second largest (after the Becontree- Dagenham estate) of a series of 'out-county' cottage estates and was based on the Garden City ideas of Ebenezer Howard. The area had previously consisted largely of lavender fields, the last remnants of the famous Mitcham lavender industry. In remembrance of the area's historic ownership by Westminster Abbey, the roads are named in alphabetical order after Monasteries and Abbeys starting in the north-west with Aberconway Road and ending with Woburn Road in the south-east. The imposing St Helier Hospital was opened in 1938. John Major, UK Prime Minister from 1990 to 1997, was born there in 1943. The estate's Bishop Andrewes Church, in Wigmore Road, was designed by the architect Geddes Hyslop in 1933. Today Today ownership of housing on the estate is split between private and local authority, with many people taking advantage of the right to buy scheme since the 1970s. The hospital still exerts an imposing presence on the estate, both economically and physically. Most of the buildings are original and many are still being used for their original purposes.

While arguably it is very similar to ABC's Extreme Makeover: Home Edition, Renovate My Family focuses on both the family and the home. It begins with the families receiving the announcement, usually in an unexpected place where many people are present (and all are in on the surprise). The family is then rushed back to their home where they are given a small amount of time to pack their things and leave their house once they are chosen because a group of home designers will build a new house for them in its place. They have only one week to build the house. The family gets to take part in tearing the house down as well. The families who are chosen for Renovate My Family usually have some sort of family issue. While the house is being built, the host takes the family to a special retreat for that week where the family not only gets to spend time together but also must confront the family issue(s) through special counseling. On the day before the house is due to be finished, the family is separated and taken to separate salons where each family member is given a makeover. They are then reunited back at their home just before the new house is to be unveiled. The show is hosted by Jay McGraw, son of Dr. Phil McGraw. Other participants included ex-Playboy Playmates and identical triplets Nicole, Erica and Jaclyn Dahm. McGraw went on to marry Erica Dahm, who is featured as one of the construction experts on the show. The show is no longer in production.

It was produced by James Keach, Stacy Keach and Tim Zinnemann and featured an original soundtrack by Ry Cooder. Cooder won the Best Music award in 1980 from the Los Angeles Film Critics Association Awards for this soundtrack. The film was entered into the 1980 Cannes Film Festival. Plot During the years following the Civil War, banks and trains become the targets of the James- Younger gang, who terrorize the Midwestern United States. The band of robbers is led by Jesse James (James Keach) and Cole Younger (David Carradine), along with several of their brothers. After getting antsy during a bank robbery, Ed Miller (Dennis Quaid) opens fire, killing the clerk and resulting in a shootout where Jesse is wounded. Jesse dismisses Ed from the gang; his brother Clell (Randy Quaid) remains. A detective, Mr. Rixley from the Pinkerton's agency, is assigned to capture the outlaws. Rixley doggedly remains on their trail, accidentally killing a Younger cousin and the youngest James brother, and losing several of his men in the process. Due to his errors, the Pinkertons back off. Jim Younger, who initially courted a girl named Beth, is disturbed to find her engaged to Ed. At his younger brother's funeral, he convinces Beth to leave Ed and she eventually marries him. Clell Miller suggests the James-Younger Gang ride north in September 1876 to rob a bank belonging to \\"squareheads\\" in Northfield, Minnesota; word is out about them and the town has been warned by the Pinkertons. The holdup goes wrong: the bank's vault has been set on a timer and cannot be opened. A cashier and another citizen are shot and killed. While trying to escape, the gang is fired upon by the townspeople. Two outlaws are killed, Clell is fatally shot, Frank (Stacy Keach) is hit in the arm, and all of the Youngers are badly wounded. The surviving gang members temporarily make camp in the woods. Jesse decides to continue running, leaving the injured to their fate when a posse catches up to them. Though reluctant and threatened by Cole, Frank joins Jesse and they ride off. Jesse informs Frank he intends to strike up a new gang when they return to Missouri, but Frank is clearly reticent. The James brothers return home to Missouri and the Youngers are captured. Rixley interrogates the Youngers in prison, but they refuse to give up Jesse. Bob and Charlie Ford offer to give up Jesse, who has asked them to join his new gang, for money. Rixley recruits them to assassinate Jesse for $15,000. They have dinner at Jesse's house and, while he adjusts a hanging picture, Bob kills him. Upon learning of his brother's assassination, Frank James turns himself in on the condition he can take Jesse home to be buried. Rixley complies with Frank in custody. Cast The Long Riders is a notable film in part due to the decision to cast four sets of actor brothers as the real-life sets of brothers: *The Keaches: Jesse James (James Keach) and Frank James (Stacy Keach) *The Carradines: Cole Younger (David Carradine), Jim Younger (Keith Carradine) and Bob Younger (Robert Carradine) *The Quaids: Ed Miller (Dennis Quaid) and Clell Miller (Randy Quaid) *The Guests: Charley Ford (Christopher Guest) and Robert Ford (Nicholas Guest) It also features an uncredited appearance by Ever Carradine, daughter of Robert Carradine and niece to David and Keith Carradine. Additionally James Keach's son, Kalen Keach, is cast as Jesse James's son Jesse E. James. Savannah Smith Boucher played Jesse James' wife, Zee. *James Whitmore Jr. as Mr. Rixley *Kevin Brophy as John Younger *Harry Carey Jr. as George Arthur *Shelby Leverington as Annie Ralston *Felice Orlandi as Mr. Reddick *Pamela Reed as Belle Starr *Lin Shaye as Kate *James Remar as Sam Starr Development =Theatre Origins= In 1971 James and Stacy Keach played the Wright brothers in a television film called The Wright Brothers (1971). This gave James the idea they should portray Jesse and Frank James in a film together. James started off by writing a play about the James brothers which Stacy financed and produced. They staged it at the Bucks County Playhouse and then toured it through schools in New Jersey. The play was then adapted into a country musical, The Bandit Kings, and performed off-Broadway at the Bowery Lane Theatre. James Keach produced (for $10,000), directed and starred as Jesse. The Keaches then decided to turn the musical into a feature film screenplay in which both could star. The brothers rewrote the material into screenplay form and combined it with the work of Bill Bryden, who had his own Jesse James script. Stacy Keach says another writer called Steven Smith \\"came in to pull all the threads together\\".Keach p 133 =Film Development= In 1974 James Keach was acting opposite Robert Carradine in the television film The Hatfields and the McCoys and mentioned the project to him; Carradine suggested that he and his brothers play the Younger brothers. David Carradine said: > Bobby and Jim came to me and said, 'Do you want to do this picture?' You > know, I just thought it was the kids talkin‚Äô , but then they said, ‚ÄôWell, > Stacy said he‚Äôll do it.‚Äô And I said, 'Well, if Stacy said he'll do it. I'll > do it.' Then they went to Stacy and said, 'Well, David said he‚Äôll do it‚Äô, > and Stacy said, \\"Well, if he‚Äôll do it, I'll do it‚Äô. Then we worked on Keith, > who was a hard sell, but he couldn't very well turn it down if the rest of > us were doing it. The idea that all the brothers in the story would be played by real-life brothers expanded, and Randy and Dennis Quaid also became attached to the project to play the Miller brothers. James Keach later recalled, \\"Everyone told me, 'You can't get all these guys together; family devotion is one thing, but this is Hollywood.' We decided to prove how serious we were by having a group picture taken. We did it at midnight in a recording studio where Keith was cutting some numbers. We sent limousines for everyone; it was quite a production.\\" The photograph helped convince NBC to finance Long Riders as a six-hour mini-series. But then Fred Silverman became president of NBC and cancelled all mini-series ordered by his predecessors. \\"It was all happening while I was on Bora Bora making The Hurricane (1979),\\" said James. \\"I spent a lot of time fishing with Tim Zinnemann, who was producing the picture. We became good friends and I told him about The Long Riders.\\" Zinnemann took the project to United Artists, who were interested in funding the film if a suitable director could be found. Stacey Keach said the gimmick of the brothers playing brothers got the film over the line.WHY THEY'RE SLOW ON THE DRAW Michael Blowen Boston Globe 29 June 1980: 1. =Walter Hill= Stacy Keach says George Roy Hill \\"scoffed at the notion\\" of the brothers casting. Zinnemann showed the script to Walter Hill who agreed to direct. Hill had been working on another film which had fallen through and, as he later said, \\"I'd been dying to do a Western for years. I just like 'em. There's a kind of an idyllic quality that surrounds the shooting of them, it seems like a more fundamental film process, more to me what movies are about than clearing crowds off a city street.\\" Hill called the film a \\"strange piece\\"; > Instead of the logical conclusion being at Northfield, it then goes on to > another phase of a spiral downward, and ends with Jesse's death. It's very > hard material to give the proper dramatic curve to. It doesn't lay out in a > classic three-act structure. It's almost a four-act piece with Northfield > and the aftermath being the culmination of the third act. The fourth act is > almost epilogue: How They Went Down... There's a line from a Jean-Luc Godard > film: \\"The jokes are funny but the bullets are real.\\" That's really what > this movie is about. These were big, reckless, high-spirited guys that were > unaware of the ripples they caused. The Ford brothers were going to be played by Beau and Jeff Bridges but by this time they had become unavailable. Jeff Bridges later said, \\"I couldn't do it because of a schedule conflict. And when I first read the script, I thought it was another case of where the material didn't match up with the gimmick. But then I saw the end result and I thought it was pretty good and I figured we would have had a good time doing it because we know all those other guys. Walter Hill is an extraordinary filmmaker and I think he added a specialness to it that the script lacked.\\"INTERVIEW: JEFF BRIDGES BALTAKE, JOE. Philadelphia Daily News4 Jan 1985: 45. Joseph Bottoms had discussed the project with James Keach but wanted himself and his brothers to play the Youngers - parts already reserved for the Carradines. Eventually Nicholas and Chris Guest played the Ford brothers. \\"The use of all the brothers can be perceived as a gimmick but I wanted a family feeling to the movie,\\" said Hill. In order to make the film, David Carradine forfeited his customary profit participation; the Keach brothers gave up the extra profit percentages they were entitled to as executive producers in order for the Carradine brothers to get the same amount of profits. Walter Hill later said his \\"code\\" for the film was to keep \\"the jokes funny and the bullets real. It is about moral choices. I think people who object to violence shouldn't go to the movies.\\"'THE LONG RIDERS' IS LONG ON BROTHERS: 'THE LONG RIDERS' Lee, Grant. Los Angeles Times 8 May 1980: h1. Walter Hill later argued that the best film that had been made about the Younger-James brothers prior to this was The Return of Frank James. \\"In the historical sense it was also the least accurate, but it had a real sense of character truth,\\" he said. Filming Some of the film, especially the Northfield scene, was shot in Parrott, Georgia.At the Movies: 'Yanks' stirs memories for its makers. Buckley, Tom. New York Times 28 Sep 1979: C14. \\"The company originally wanted to shoot in Missouri, but they found that urban sprawl just blew that out of the tub,\\" said a publicist. \\"Parrott was chosen because it's almost as if time stood still there. The ravages of the years have not touched the buildings and it closely resembles Northfield, Minn., in 1876.\\"James gang dies into Parrott, Ga. The Globe and Mail 29 Aug 1979: P.12. Hill says the most difficult sequence was the one where horses jumped through glass. \\"We trained them for three weeks, making them do the jump without the glass. Once we conditioned them to that, we put the glass in. It's a big surprise to the horses, and they'll only do it once. We had to use a different set of horses for the second jump.\\" Stacey Keach says the brothers would bond by playing music together every night during the shoot. He says the Guest brothers would sit apart from the others because they were playing villains.Keach p 135 Hill shot the sequence in slow motion, a technique associated with the Westerns of Sam Peckinpah. Hill believes \\"the way Sam used slow motion was almost directly opposite to mine. What Sam was doing was making individual moments more real by extending them, kind of underlining the horrible moment of being shot. The Long Riders is meant to be almost dream- like to have the reality of a nightmare, where everything is going wrong but there's no focus to it, you don't know where you are or how you got there.\\" James Keach said the film \\"was very authentic, not a traditional Western with sagebursh and desert. Ours has more of a midwestern feel to it. We've high hopes for it but I just wish we had more time.\\"WATCHING BLATTY WILL A WINNER Los Angeles Times 11 Mar 1980: g6. When the film went over its original $7.5 million budget, the Keaches forfeited their executive producer fees. \\"The Long Riders has been made on faith and idealism,\\" said Keach. Stacy Keach wrote in his memoirs that Hill \\"did a great job imposing his vision on our script without undermining its essence\\" but says \\"none of us had the clout\\" to stop the studio from cutting several scenes involving Keach and Randy Quaid. \\"They just wanted to keep the story moving and focus on the action and not the personal relationships.\\"Keach p 136 Soundtrack The music for the film was composed, arranged, and performed by Ry Cooder. Cooder said Hill had heard one of his records while making the film \\"and thought that my music had an atmospheric quality he was looking for. Walter likes scores to be part of his movie‚Äôs environment instead of the factor that‚Äôs driving it, and I‚Äôve always looked at film music as an environmental issue.\\"Schweiger p 16 Other performers on the soundtrack were multi-instrumentalist David Lindley and percussionist Milt Holland.The Long Riders, DVD, Metro-Goldwin-Mayer Studios Inc. 2001, credits Some of the songs were released as an album, The Long Riders. It was the first of several soundtracks Cooder would write for Walter Hill.Ry Cooder's Long Ride BY PATRICK ERCOLANO. The Washington Post 11 July 1980: PAGE39. Cooder later said this was \\"the simplest\\" of his soundtracks to do, adding that: > I‚Äôd heard and played enough old time-Southern music that it wasn‚Äôt too much > of a stretch for me to create it.

Schweiger p 17 Release =Critical Response= Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote of the film, \\"Even its languid moments hold a certain fascination, what with Ric Waite's handsome photography and a cast that Noah might envy.

C14. Todd McCarthy of Variety stated that the film \\"is striking in several ways, not the least of which being the casting of actor brothers as historical outlaw kin, but narrative is episodic in the extreme and disparate artistic qualities fail to completely jell into satisfactory whole. Despite interesting try, this wouldn't appear to be the film to get Westerns off the ground again.\\"McCarthy, Todd (May 7, 1980). \\"Film Reviews: The Long Riders\\". Variety. 10. Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote that \\"the Western will live as long as directors make Westerns as fresh and exciting as 'The Long Riders,' which tells an oft-told story uncommonly well.\\"Siskel, Gene (May 16, 1980). \\"'The Long Riders': Bloody, but shot through with class\\". Chicago Tribune. Section 3, p. 3. Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times said, \\"Since 'The Long Riders' various writers, which include James and Stacy Keach, who also play Jesse and Frank James, and its director Walter Hill, haven't anything new to reveal, their film by default becomes merely an excuse to restage that Northfield raid in as bloody a way as possible. This hollow and tedious outlaw saga may feature an unprecedented number of brothers‚Äîfour sets, no less‚Äîin the leading roles, but it's no family film, that's for sure.\\"Thomas, Kevin (May 16, 1980). \\"New Westerns With Old Themes\\". Los Angeles Times. Part VI, p. 2. Gary Arnold of The Washington Post declared that the film \\"seems a flawlessly felt and visualized western, true to the subject matter and the aspirations the filmmakers probably held for it.\\"Arnold, Gary (May 16, 1980). \\"Easy 'Riders'\\". The Washington Post. D1. David Ansen of Newsweek wrote: \\"the story seems more re-enacted than acted and one is finally more impressed than moved. Only David Carradine's cool, mangy macho as Cole Younger and Pamela Reed's jaundiced wit as Belle Starr cut through the tempered, elegiac surface. The screenplay (by Bill Bryden, Steven Phillip Smith, Stacy and James Keach) is basically an assemblage of bits and pieces that doesn't build toward any real emotional payoff. Yet 'The Long Riders' is still the best Western in many years ‚Äî it has the laconic elegance of a ritual.\\"Ansen, David (June 2, 1980). \\"Back in the Saddle\\". Newsweek. 87. Film historian Leonard Maltin described this picture as \\"Stylish, if extremely bloody...All In the Family Out West\\" and gave it 3 out of a possible 4 stars in his annual Movie & Video Guide (no longer published). On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 83% based on , with a weighted average rating of 6.57/10. On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating to reviews, the film has a weighted average score of 64 out of 100, based on 5 critics, indicating \\"Generally favorable reviews\\". =Box Office= The Long Riders was a box office disappointment upon its initial release. According to Film Comment it made $5,891,149 in the USA, in part due to \\"a terrible campaign that emphasized how alike all the players looked without exploiting the family theme that might have aided box office.\\"The Sixth Annual Grosses Gloss Meisel, Myron.

In June 1981 James Keach wrote a letter to the Los Angeles Times in response to an article on the poor box office performance of Westerns.

In September 1982 Stacy Keach said \\"There's the possibility of doing something for television with it. There's a tremendous amount of history that goes on after The Long Riders.

The nearest major town is Beldanga. It has its own two local gram panchayat. It is particularly well known due to the Battle of Plassey fought there in June 1757, between the private army of the British East India Company and the army of the king of Bengal, Nawab Siraj-ud-Daulah. Etymology The name Palashi is derived from the Bengali word for the red-flowered tree (, ), ( or ). The Bengali word is ultimately derived from . The British East India Company referred to it as ‚ÄòPlassey‚Äô. History Palashi achieved historical significance when, on 23 June 1757, the Battle of Plassey was fought between the forces of Siraj Ud Daulah, the last reigning Nawab of Bengal (and his French support troops), and the troops of the British East India Company, led by Robert Clive. This event, part of the Seven Years' War, ultimately led to the establishment of British rule in Bengal and, eventually, the whole Indian subcontinent. During British rule Plassey became part of Nadia District of Bengal.Plassey ‚Äì Imperial Gazetteer of India, v. 20, p. 156.

The alluvial plains are cut across by such distributaries as Jalangi, Churni and Ichhamati. With these rivers getting silted up, floods are a recurring feature.Gangopadhyay, Basudev, Paschimbanga Parichay, 2001, , p. 70, Sishu Sahitya SansadThe Krishnanagar Sadar subdivision, presented in the map alongside, has the Bhagirathi on the west, with Purba Bardhaman district lying across the river. The long stretch along the Bhagirathi has many swamps. The area between the Bhagirathi and the Jalangi, which flows through the middle of the subdivision, is known as Kalantar, a low-lying tract of black clay soil. A big part of the subdivision forms the Krishnanagar-Santipur Plain, which occupies the central part of the district. The Jalangi, after flowing through the middle of the subdivision, turns right and joins the Bhagirathi. On the south-east, the Churni separates the Krishnanagar-Santipur Plain from the Ranaghat-Chakdaha Plain. The east forms the boundary with Bangladesh.The subdivision is moderately urbanized. 20.795% of the population lives in urban areas and 79.205% lives in rural areas.

There is a Monument, commonly known as Palashi Monument established in memoirs of the martyrs of the battle. The Monument is protected and supervised by the Archaeological Survey of India. The grounds where the historic Battle of Plassey was fought is today marked with shrines, obelisks and memorials to the fallen generals and soldiers of Siraj Ud-Daulah. A set of three obelisks marks homage to the spot where Bakshi Mir Madan (the chief of the Nawab's artillery), Bahadur Ali Khan (Commander of Musketeers) and Nauwe Singh Hazari (the Captain of Artillery) were killed in the battle. Three Obelisks of Mirmadan, Nabe Singh Hajari and Bahadur Khan near Plassey A plaque indicates that they fell here at 2 p.m on 23 June 1757 and were leaders of Nawab Siraj-Ud_Daula, at the head of the charge ordered by Mir Madan. Almost 5 km north from the Plassey battlefield, there is a Tomb of Farid Shah in Faridpur village, Dead body of Mir Madan was buried there. Statue of Siraj A gold coloured statue of Siraj Ud Daula lies next to the Palashi Monument, in a clearing amidst mango orchards and fields. The tombs of Siraj Ud Daulah, Mir Jafar, their wives and a number of generals in Siraj's army lie close by around Murshidabad.

On the opposite bank the Ruvuma receives, besides the Lujenda, the Msinje River and Luchulingo River, flowing in broad valleys running from south to north. The Lujenda rises in proximity to Lake Chilwa, in the small Lake Chiuta (1,700 ft), the swamps to the south of this being separated from Chilwa only by a narrow wooded ridge. The stream which issues from Chiuta passes by a swampy valley into the narrow Lake Amaramba, from which the Lujenda River finally issues as a stream 80 yards wide. Lower down it varies greatly in breadth, containing in many parts long wooded islands which rise above the flood level, and are often inhabited. The river is fordable in many places in the dry season. At its mouth it is about a mile wide. The lower Ruvuma, which is often half a mile wide but generally shallow, flows through a swampy valley flanked by plateau escarpments containing several small backwaters of the river. The mouth is near 10¬∞ 28' S., 40¬∞ 30' E., the boundary near the coast being formed by the parallel of 10¬∞ 40'. The length of the Ruvuma is about .  Bridge  A bridge called Unity Bridge across the river between Mozambique and Tanzania was proposed as early as 1975, and although construction was started, the project was abandoned due to lack of funds. In 2002 the two national governments made a formal agreement to build a new 600 metre bridge across the river, and this was finally opened in a ceremony on 25 May 2010. The bridge is located at Negomano, 200 km inland and 100 km from the nearest surfaced road in Mozambique. The site was agreed between Presidents Machel and Nyerere because this was the site of the first entry into Mozambique by Frelimo forces in the Mozambican War of Independence on 25 September 1964. Negomano was also the location where the German forces crossed the Rovuma river on 25 November 1917.Paice, Edward, 2008, Tip & Run, Phoenix, p. 339 First foundation stones were laid on the Tanzanian and Mozambique sides on October 10th 2005. Construction was completed early 2010 and cost USD $28 million. It used to be possible to cross the river with rafts (located at the Tanzanian side) that could carry 3 jeeps. The ferry sank in 2008 and has not been replaced. At low water the river is sometimes fordable with a good 4-wheel drive. A smaller bridge called Unity Two was also completed in 2007 on the upper Rovuma close to Matchedge in Niassa Province.

Historically the Kaska people have had a respectful relationship with the land and the environment. Kaska took part in the traditional First Nations seasonal round, following game like caribou and other seasonal food like berries. They used waterways like the Liard River and Frances River to travel from Dease Lake to Frances Lake. They also had several established bush trails for travelling.Farnell, G. (2014).

After colonization of Yukon, the building of the Alaska Highway, and the government's attempts at assimilation, the Kaska people have lost much of their culture.

Dubbed \\"The Franchise\\" of Ring of Honor, Lethal is a two- time ROH World Champion, and holds the record for most combined days with the ROH World Championship in company history. He was also a record-setting two- time and longest reigning ROH World Television Champion, holding the title for 567 days, and the only man to hold the World Television Championship and the World Championship at the same time. After winning the ROH World Tag Team Championship, Lethal became the only man to have held the World, World Tag Team, World Television and ROH Pure championships. He is also known for his work in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), where he was a six-time X Division Champion and a one-time World Tag Team Champion with Consequences Creed. Between ROH and TNA, Lethal has won 13 total championships.  Early life  Jamar Shipman was born on April 29, 1985, in Elizabeth, New Jersey. He is the middle child of Ronald and Shirley Shipman, with two brothers and two sisters. In July 2001, aged 16, Shipman won a contest held by Jersey All Pro Wrestling (JAPW) which entitled the winner to a lifetime of free training in the JAPW professional wrestling school. He spent six months training there, at the end of which the school closed down. He then began training under Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) alumni Mikey Whipwreck and Dan Maff.  Professional wrestling career  = Jersey All Pro-Wrestling =  Debut and various title reigns (2001-2004)  Shipman made his wrestling debut under the ring name Jay Lethal on October 26, 2001, at JAPW's \\"Class Of 2001 Student Show\\", in a match where he defeated Dixie. He won his first Championship, the JAPW Television Championship, on September 13, 2002, in Bayonne, New Jersey, at Never Forget, defeating the champion, Ghost Shadow, and Rain in a three-way match. His reign lasted an unprecedented and unreplicated eleven months, with Lethal finally losing to Crazy Ivan on August 22, 2003, in Rahway, New Jersey at Counter-Strike. Lethal also held the JAPW Light Heavyweight Championship, defeating the champion, Azrieal, Insane Dragon and Jack Evans on February 28, 2004, at Revolution, in a four-way match. Azrieal tried to regain the title for eight months, but repeatedly lost to Lethal. On December 10, 2004, at Seasons Beatings, Azrieal gained one more shot at the JAPW Light Heavyweight Championship by challenging Lethal to a \\"belt versus loser leaves town\\" match, which would see Azrieal leave JAPW if he lost. Azrieal was able to win the match, thus ending their lengthy feud.  JAPW Heavyweight Champion (2005-2009)  Jay Lethal in 2005 With two lengthy title reigns in the space of two years, Lethal had established himself as a dominant member of the JAPW roster by 2005, and he began challenging for the JAPW Heavyweight Championship, which had been held by Dan Maff since December 2003. On January 29, 2005, at Wild Card, Lethal pinned Maff in a title match, but the decision was overturned by crooked referee Sean Hanson. In March 2005, Maff left JAPW and retired from wrestling following an argument with Homicide, thus vacating the JAPW Heavyweight Championship. Lethal was awarded the Heavyweight Championship on March 26 at Caged Fury 2 held in the ECW Arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, but he refused to accept it, claiming that he wanted to \\"earn\\" the title. JAPW mainstay Homicide then challenged Lethal to an impromptu match for the vacant title, which Homicide won. Lethal finally won the JAPW Heavyweight Championship on May 21 in Braintree, Massachusetts, at Braintree Invasion defeating Homicide, Kevin Steen and Samoa Joe in a four-way match by pinning Homicide following a diving headbutt. Lethal defeated Steve Corino on June 4 at HomeComing with his father in his corner, but, after the match, Corino and Ricky Landell handcuffed Lethal to the top rope and attacked his father with Corino placing him in a crossface. This led to a six-man tag match on July 16, at Gored pitting Lethal and his father against Corino, Landell and Landell's manager, Rick Silver. Lethal and his father were outnumbered, but managed to pull off a win at the last minute after Lethal's mother introduced their partner, the returning Charlie Haas. After Haas attacked Lethal during the post-match celebrations, a title match was booked between Haas and Lethal for Haas of Pain held on September 10, which was won by Lethal. On October 22 at 8th Year Anniversary Show Lethal ended his feud with Corino by defeating him for the title in a Dog Collar match with help from Tommy Dreamer. Lethal's next feud would be with The D-Factor's Rhino, who, on November 12, 2005, at Fall Out, assaulted him following his successful title defense against B-Boy. On January 7, 2006, at Wild Card II, Lethal lost the JAPW Heavyweight Championship to Rhino, who won the bout after giving Lethal a Rhino Driver through a table from the top rope. Lethal tried twice to regain his title, first on February 18, 2006, in a three-way match which also included Teddy Hart, and then on May 20, 2006, but was unsuccessful both times at regaining the title. After unsuccessfully going after the JAPW Light Heavyweight Championship held by Frankie Kazarian, Lethal and former rival Azrieal managed to win the JAPW Tag Team Championship by defeating the champions The Outcast Killaz (Oman Tortuga and Diablo Santiago) and The S.A.T. (Jose and Joel Maximo) in a three-way dance on October 28, 2006, at 9th Year Anniversary Show, held in Rahway, New Jersey. On June 9, 2007, at Back to Business, The Latin American Xchange of Homicide and Hernandez defeated Lethal and Azrieal for the titles. At the beginning of 2009 Lethal proclaimed that it was his destiny to win back the JAPW Heavyweight title, held by Kenny Omega. On February 28, 2009, in Jersey City, at Jersey City Rumble Lethal won a 21-person Jersey City Rumble to earn the right to challenge for Omega's title that same night. In the end, Lethal pinned Omega with the flipping release dragon suplex after Omega's associate Dan Maff turned on him, to win the JAPW Heavyweight Championship for the second time. During the match Maff had also attacked Lethal and that lead to a Championship match between the two on March 28, at Unfinished Business, in which Lethal managed to retain his title. Lethal defeated Maff again on April 18 at International Invasion, but only after Trent Acid interfered in the match. Their feud ended on June 27 in Jersey City, at Caged Destiny, when Maff defeated Lethal for the title inside a steel cage. Lethal has not made any appearances for JAPW since. = Ring of Honor =  Hydro (2003‚Äì2004)  Shipman made his Ring of Honor (ROH) debut as Hydro, a member of Special K on Revenge on the Prophecy held in West Mifflin, Pennsylvania, on January 11, 2003. On May 22, 2004, at Generation Next he faced Alex Shelley in a singles match. Though he lost, Shelley recognized his pure wrestling talent and offered him membership in Generation Next, Shelley's stable of future stars. Hydro declined, opting to remain part of Special K. Hydro won a four corner survival match at World Title Classic on June 12, which entitled him to enter the Pure Wrestling tournament later that year. At Survival of the Fittest on June 24, he and Dixie took part in a four-way tag match for the Tag Team Championship in a losing effort, as CM Punk single-handedly defended the title to allow his tag team partner and co-champion Colt Cabana to prepare for his match later that evening. Hydro then challenged Punk to an impromptu match, which Punk also won. Hydro shook hands before the match, thus following the \\"Code of Honor\\" (which Special K normally ignored).  Samoa Joe's prot√©g√© (2004‚Äì2005)  Hydro took part in the Pure Wrestling tournament on July 17, 2004, at Reborn: Completion. At the outset of the event, World Champion Samoa Joe advised Hydro to change his name and become more serious. Acting on Joe's advice, Hydro left Special K and went back to calling himself Jay Lethal. He was eliminated from the tournament after Doug Williams pinned him in a four- way match using the Chaos Theory. At Testing the Limit on August 7, Lethal took part in a four-way match, pitting him against Alex Shelley, Ace Steel and 2 Cold Scorpio. Despite the moral support of his parents, who were in the audience, Lethal suffered a second loss to Shelley. Having rejected Shelley's offer of a place in Generation Next before the match for a second time, Lethal asked Shelley for a singles match. Lethal and Shelley faced one another for a third time on August 28 at Scramble Cage Melee, with Shelley cheating to gain a third victory. Having lost every match for months, Lethal was obliged to face Matt Stryker at Glory by Honor III on September 11 with his ROH career on the line. Lethal won, breaking his losing streak. Low Ki, who had been feuding with Samoa Joe for several months, challenged Lethal, as Joe's prot√©g√©, at The Midnight Express Reunion on October 2. In the course of the match, Low Ki's manager Julius Smokes harassed Lethal's parents (once again watching the match from the audience) and Low Ki spat at Lethal's mother. Low Ki easily defeated Lethal, then mocked him after the match. Lethal lost to Chad Collyer at Gold on October 15, but recovered with a win over Delirious the next day at Joe vs. Punk II. He teamed with his mentor, Samoa Joe, and lost to John Walters and Nigel McGuinness at Weekend Of Thunder: Night One on November 5, before suffering another loss to The Embassy member Jimmy Rave the subsequent evening. After his match with Rave, Lethal attacked Prince Nana, the leader of The Embassy. This led to Nana recruiting several masked mercenaries (dubbed the \\"Weapons of Masked Destruction\\") in an attempt to end Lethal's career. Lethal defeated both WMDs at All-Star Extravaganza 2 on December 4 and Final Battle 2004 on December 26 respectively, in both cases ending the match with his signature flipping release dragon suplex. Lethal's feud with The Embassy continued into 2005, and on February 19 at the Third Anniversary Celebration: Part One he pinned Embassy member Jimmy Rave to become number one contender to the Pure Championship. Pure Champion and Embassy member John Walters, who had control over when to wrestle his title matches, chose to have the title defense immediately after Lethal's match, defeating the exhausted Lethal to retain his title following a trifecta of Lung Blowers. Lethal was scheduled to face Walters for the title in a re-match at Trios Tournament 2005 on March 5 in Philadelphia, but was attacked by an unknown assailant backstage, resulting in Lethal's eye swelling shut. Despite the injury, Lethal went on to defeat Walters later that night to win the Pure Championship, his first title in ROH. On March 12 at Back to Basics, Lethal and Samoa Joe teamed once again to face CM Punk and Spanky, with Lethal pinning Spanky with a bridging dragon suplex. At the Best of the American Super Juniors Tournament on April 2, Lethal and Joe faced Jimmy Jacobs and B.J. Whitmer for the vacant Tag Team Championship, but were defeated. Lethal retained his Pure Championship in a match with Spanky at Stalemate on April 16, but on May 7 at Manhattan Mayhem he lost the title to his mentor Samoa Joe. After the match, both men were ambushed after the match by The Rottweilers, who revealed Low Ki was the one who attacked Lethal at Trios Tournament 2005. This led to a tag match that same night pitting Lethal and Joe against Low Ki and fellow Rottweiler Homicide. The match ended when Homicide gave Lethal Da Cop Killa while Low Ki simultaneously delivered a Ghetto Stomp, driving Lethal's neck into the ground. Lethal was stretchered from the arena, wearing a neck brace, ostensibly seriously injured. After being out \\"injured\\" for a month, Lethal returned on June 12 at The Future is Now to save James Gibson from a beating at the hands of The Rottweilers. He returned to the ring on June 18 at Death Before Dishonor III, where he faced Low Ki in a grudge match which was declared a no contest after both men were disqualified. At Sign of Dishonor on July 8, Lethal teamed with fellow former Special K member Dixie to defeat The Heartbreak Express. Later that evening, Mick Foley forced World Champion CM Punk, who had signed with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) and was trying to leave ROH with the World Championship, to defend his title against Lethal. Punk retained his title with a muscle buster/rear naked choke combination, often used by Samoa Joe, who had come ringside to cheer Lethal on. Seeking revenge for the neck injury he had in May, Lethal challenged Homicide at Escape from New York on July 9, but lost due to Homicide using a chain. On July 23 at The Homecoming he joined forces with Samoa Joe and James Gibson to face The Rottweilers (Homicide, Low Ki and Ricky Reyes) but again suffered a defeat, with Homicide using the chain this time on Gibson. Lethal challenged Low Ki once more on August 12 at Redemption as part of his ongoing rivalry with The Rottweilers. The match ended in a draw after the enemies fought outside the ring and were counted out. After the match, Homicide came to the ring to attack Lethal, but was stopped by his opponent for the night, Matt Hardy. On August 13 at Punk: The Final Chapter, Lethal and Joe defeated Low Ki and Homicide by disqualification after Homicide hit an elbow drop to the referee. Afterwards the four men brawled all over the arena, with Low Ki Ghetto Stomping Lethal off the bleachers and ending with him giving Lethal the Ki Krusher in the middle of the ring. At Glory by Honor IV on September 17, Lethal lost to Low Ki in a \\"Fight Without Honor\\". He went on to defeat Low Ki later that night, however, in a standard singles match to end their feud. He defeated Sal Rinauro to advance to the finals of the 2005 Survival of the Fittest tournament on September 24, but was eliminated by Roderick Strong.  Last feuds and departure (2005‚Äì2006)  After unsuccessfully challenging Nigel McGuinness for the Pure Championship on October 1, Lethal went undefeated until November 19, 2005, when he and Samoa Joe lost to Austin Aries and Roderick Strong in a number one contender's match for the Tag Team Championship. On December 3, 2005, at Steel Cage Warfare, Lethal wrestled Joe in an exhibition match. During the bout, Lethal turned heel by attacking Joe's knee with a chair and then pinned him with the flipping release dragon suplex. On January 27, 2006, Lethal teamed with Bryan Danielson, losing to Austin Aries and Roderick Strong in a match for the Tag Team Championship. At the Fourth Anniversary Show on February 25, 2006, in Edison, New Jersey, Lethal lost cleanly to Samoa Joe to end their short-lived feud. He departed from the promotion following this, but subsequently returned three times for one-night appearances (working all matches as a face), losing to Pure Champion Nigel McGuinness on May 13, teaming with Colt Cabana on July 15 in a losing effort against Jimmy Rave and Sal Rinauro, and losing a four way survival match against Claudio Castagnoli, Christopher Daniels, and the match winner, Nigel McGuinness on August 5, 2006. = Total Nonstop Action Wrestling =  Pursuit of the X Division Championship (2005‚Äì2006)  Lethal working for TNA While wrestling for JAPW, Lethal caught the eye of Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) producer and announcer Jeremy Borash, who offered him a spot in the TNA roster. Lethal debuted in TNA on the December 17, 2005 episode of Impact!, losing to X Division Champion and fellow ROH alum Samoa Joe. In January 2006, he was signed to a contract by TNA. He made his pay-per-view debut at Against All Odds in 2006 on February 12, defeating Matt Bentley, Alex Shelley and Petey Williams in a four-way match by pinning Williams. On the February 18, 2006 episode of Impact!, Lethal defeated Roderick Strong and Shannon Moore to earn a spot in Team USA, the defending champions in the 2006 World X Cup. Other members of the team were Chris Sabin, Sonjay Dutt and Alex Shelley. Team USA wrestled their first match at Lockdown on April 23, 2006, where Lethal, Dutt and Shelley lost to Team Japan (Black Tiger, Minoru Tanaka and Hirooki Goto) after Black Tiger pinned Lethal with a Black Tiger suplex. On the April 27, 2006 episode of Impact!, Lethal unsuccessfully challenged Samoa Joe for the X Division Championship. On May 14 at Sacrifice Lethal participated in the World X Cup Gauntlet match, but ended up being the second to last man eliminated from the match by Team Mexico's Puma. The tournament ended on the following episode of Impact! with Chris Sabin defeating Team Canada's Petey Williams to win the World X Cup for Team USA. In the June 1, 2006 episode of Impact!, Lethal scored a win over Alex Shelley, but was after the match attacked by his associate Kevin Nash, who had declared a war on the X Division in the aftermath of Team USA's World X Cup victory. During the July 13, 2006 episode, Lethal won the right to challenge for the title of his choosing by scoring the deciding fall in an eight-man \\"All or Nothing\\" tag team match, where he teamed with Rhino and Team 3D (Brother Ray and Brother Devon) against Team Canada (Petey Williams, Bobby Roode, Eric Young and A1). The next week, Lethal challenged Jeff Jarrett for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, but was defeated following interference from Scott Steiner. Two weeks later, Lethal took part in a five way X Division match to determine the number one contender for the title. Although Petey Williams won the match, one week later Lethal was added to the match, making it a three-way match for the X Division title at Hard Justice involving Lethal, Williams and defending champion Senshi. Lethal was pinned by Senshi after Williams hit him with his Canadian Destroyer. In a strong product placement, Lethal alongside Sonjay Dutt, got fellow X Division superstar Chris Sabin ready for his match at No Surrender by watching clips of Jackass Number Two, which was being heavily promoted by TNA at the time. One night on Impact!, during Chris Sabin's match with Alex Shelley, Shelley's partner Johnny Devine was pushed in a shopping cart and rammed into the steel post, allowing Sabin to pin Shelley. The following week, Lethal was able to defeat Petey Williams after Sabin and Dutt distracted the referee, allowing Lethal to roll a bowling ball into Petey's groin. Following in this storyline, Lethal went on to defeat Williams again on September 24, 2006, at the No Surrender pay-per-view, following Williams allegedly being given laxatives by stable mate Dutt, rendering him incapable of doing most of his moves, and giving Lethal the victory when Williams could no longer \\"hold it\\". He and Dutt were also involved in Sabin's match later in the night with similar antics involving a blow-up doll, but to no avail as Sabin would lose the match despite the interference. These, too, were designed as advertising for Jackass Number Two, as were other moments for Mortal Kombat: Armageddon.  Black Machismo (2006‚Äì2008)  Lethal in his \\"Black Machismo\\" gimmick In December 2006, Kevin Nash recruited Lethal, Senshi, Austin Starr, Sonjay Dutt and Alex Shelley to compete in a tournament known as the Paparazzi Championship Series. The series included a push-up contest, musical chairs, Limbo contest, Texas Hold'em and a few others, although Lethal did not win the tournament. After the tournament, which concluded in January 2007, Lethal and Dutt continued appearing in Paparazzi segments with Nash and PCS winner Alex Shelley, with Nash promising to give Lethal and Dutt Extreme Makeovers to help advance their careers. The February 15 episode of Impact! included a segment named \\"Paparazzi Idol\\", a parody of American Idol. After Lethal's attempt to sing was disliked by the judges, judge Kevin Nash suggested that Lethal do an impression, to which Lethal responded with a spot-on impression of wrestling legend \\"Macho Man\\" Randy Savage. The April 5, 2007 episode of Impact! presented Lethal and Dutt with their new gimmicks; Lethal's new gimmick was impersonating Savage. The following week, Nash introduced Lethal, who was led to the ring by a remixed version of Savage's entrance theme \\"Pomp and Circumstance\\" and dressed in full \\"Macho Man\\" attire, as \\"Black Machismo\\" Jay Lethal. He imitated Savage's trademark catchphrase \\"Oh yeah!\\" and was able to defeat X Division Champion Chris Sabin using many of Savage's signature in- ring maneuvers and mannerisms, most notably his diving elbow drop finisher. Slammiversary 2009 At the Lockdown pay-per-view on April 15, 2007, Lethal nearly won the X Division title from Sabin in a five-person Xscape match (five start the match in the cage; the first three eliminations are done by pinfall or submission; the final two must then try to escape the cage, with the first one to exit being declared the winner). Lethal and Sabin were both climbing over the same side of the cage, fighting as they went, and Sabin kicked Lethal's leg so that his leg went through the bars of the cage, trapping him there while Sabin jumped down and won the match. On the April 26 episode of Impact! Lethal and tag team partner, Sonjay Dutt, who had rejected Nash's idea for his new gimmick, won a shot at the X Division Championship held by Chris Sabin at Sacrifice. Dutt, however, was unhappy at Lethal getting the pinfall. After their loss to Sabin at Sacrifice, both Dutt and Lethal started brawling until Kevin Nash came out and separated the two until Dutt kicked Nash and stormed out of the ring visibly upset. On May 8, TNA Mobile announced that Randy Savage himself called Jay Lethal and said that he loved the \\"Black Machismo\\" character as the two spoke on the phone for several minutes. However, Lethal subsequently expressed doubt over whether he had really spoken with Savage as the Macho Man's trademark voice is easily imitated. At Slammiversary, Lethal defeated Chris Sabin in a singles match for the X Division Championship, his first title in TNA. Only days later, however, on the following Impact!, he lost the title to Samoa Joe after Chris Sabin was pinned, in a Match of Champions three-way qualifying match. At Victory Road Lethal competed in an Ultimate X gauntlet match in a losing effort after Christopher Daniels retrieved the X. At Hard Justice Lethal and Sonjay Dutt, who had made peace with Lethal after coming up with the gimmick of a guru, defeated Triple X's Christopher Daniels and Senshi and The Motor City Machineguns (Alex Shelley and Chris Sabin) in a three-way tag match when Lethal pinned Daniels. This led to Jim Cornette booking a match on the August 16 episode of Impact! pitting Daniels versus Lethal with the winner becoming the number one contender to the X Division title, which Lethal would go on to win. As a result of that Lethal would go on to face Triple Crown champion Kurt Angle for the X Division title at No Surrender, where Lethal would beat Angle cleanly with a roll-up to win the X Division Championship for the second time. At Genesis Lethal successfully defended his X Division Championship against his best friend, Sonjay Dutt, who during the match once again began showing signs of annoyance towards Lethal and his mannerisms. However, after the match Dutt made peace with Lethal, who then invited SoCal Val, TNA's ring girl, to the ring to celebrate the victory. The celebration was cut short by Team 3D (Brother Ray and Brother Devon), who were at the time feuding with the fan favorite-turned Motor City Machineguns, who beat down both Lethal and Dutt and left the arena with Lethal's Championship belt. 3D later declared a war on the entire X Division, claiming that its wrestlers were just \\"little boys\\" and that they needed to be toughened up. During the feud Johnny Devine turned on the X Division and joined Team 3D, often carrying Lethal's stolen belt around, before officially winning it in a Street Fight on the January 24, 2008, episode of Impact!, following interference from Team 3D. The feud ended on February 10 at Against All Odds, where Lethal, Shelley and Sabin defeated Team 3D and Devine in a six-man street fight, ending with Lethal pinning Devine to also win back the X Division Championship. On April 17, 2008, Lethal lost his X Division title after Petey Williams attacked him from behind after a match and cashed in his \\"Feast or Fired\\" briefcase for his X Division title shot. Lethal in 2008 On the next episode of Impact!, Lethal proposed to his on- screen girlfriend SoCal Val, which she accepted. At Slammiversary Sonjay Dutt, after months of teasing, finally turned heel by interrupting the wedding ceremony and proclaiming his love for Val, before attacking Lethal and his wedding guests. On the next two Impact! Lethal attacked Dutt out of rage when Dutt claimed that Val loved him. On the next Impact! So Cal Val said that she wanted to put off the wedding. Dutt and Lethal met at Victory Road in a one on one contest, which Dutt won after Val pleaded with Lethal to stop hurting Dutt, which allowed Dutt to take advantage and roll up Lethal. Lethal proposed to Val again, but found that her ring was missing, as Dutt had stolen it. Lethal and Dutt would meet again in a Black Tie Brawl and Chain match at Hard Justice, which Lethal won, even though Val distracted him by leaving during the match, because he wouldn't stop hurting Dutt. During a segment of Karen's Angle, Dutt confronted Val and attempted to seduce her, until Lethal attacked him and during the fight accidentally elbowed Val in the face. The following week Val announced that she would put the wedding ring up for grabs in a \\"Ladder of Love match\\" on September 14 at No Surrender. At No Surrender Val turned on Lethal by giving him a low blow, which allowed Dutt to climb the ladder and get the wedding ring.  Lethal Consequences (2008‚Äì2009)  At Bound for Glory IV Lethal won the Steel Asylum match to become the number 1 contender to the X Division title. On the October 23 live episode of Impact! Sheik Abdul Bashir defeated Lethal to retain the championship. The following week, Lethal along with A.J. Styles, Samoa Joe, Consequences Creed, Petey Williams, Eric Young, O.D.B. and The Motor City Machineguns formed a faction of younger wrestlers known as the TNA Frontline to oppose The Main Event Mafia. Lethal after winning the Steel Asylum at Bound for Glory IV On December 6, Lethal won one of the \\"Feast or Fired\\" briefcases, which was later revealed to contain a shot at the TNA World Tag Team Championship. On the January 8, 2009 episode of Impact!, Lethal cashed in his briefcase, formed a team with Consequences Creed and defeated then-champions Beer Money, Inc. (Robert Roode and James Storm) after Roode's singles match with Matt Morgan to become the new TNA World Tag Team Champions. However, they quickly lost the titles back to Beer Money, Inc. at the Genesis pay-per-view on January 11. On January 15, Lethal and Creed defeated Abyss and Matt Morgan to earn another shot at the Tag Team Championship. Upon becoming the number one contenders, Lethal and Creed formed a long-term tag team known as Lethal Consequences (a combination of their ring names) and then started a feud with The Motor City Machineguns (Alex Shelley and Chris Sabin) after dissention between the Guns and the Frontline. They were scheduled a match with the Guns on February 5, but Beer Money interfered in Creed's entrance, injuring his left shoulder. Frontline member Eric Young substituted for Creed, winning the match with a Death Valley driver to both Shelley and Sabin. Beer Money then went on to retain the title at Against All Odds due to Creed's shoulder injury. After their title match, Lethal Consequences continued their feud with the Motor City Machineguns, with both teams winning one match a piece over the next two weeks. At Destination X, Lethal competed in an Ultimate X match for the X Division Championship, along with Consequences Creed, Chris Sabin, Alex Shelley and Suicide, who ended up winning the match and the Championship. On April 24, 2009, it was announced on TNAWrestling.com that Lethal had signed a new multi-year deal with the company. On the November 5, 2009, episode of Impact! Jay Lethal announced an open invitational challenge. Due to the announcement of Hulk Hogan joining TNA, Lethal challenged wrestling legends to take him on. The following week, Jim Neidhart answered the challenge and defeated Lethal. The series continued on the December 17 episode of Impact!, when Tatanka answered the challenge and defeated Lethal in a singles match. After months of inactivity, Lethal's alliance with Consequences Creed came officially to an end on March 29, 2010, when Creed was released from his contract.  Feud with Ric Flair and Fortune (2010‚Äì2011)  Lethal in the ring with Ric Flair After spending most of early 2010 off TV, Lethal returned on the March 29 episode of Impact! by approaching Hulk Hogan, reminiscing about their days as \\"The Mega Powers\\" (Hogan's old team with Randy Savage). Playing along with Lethal's antics, Hogan placed him in charge of the show for his one-week absence due to a business trip. After raising the ire of Hogan's business partner Eric Bischoff with his comedic booking ideas, Bischoff placed Lethal in a two-on-one handicap match against Beer Money, Inc.; Lethal, however, managed to win the match after surprising Robert Roode with a roll-up. On the May 3 episode of Impact!, Hogan gave Lethal Ric Flair's Hall of Fame ring that Abyss had won from him the previous week. When Lethal, now imitating Flair, was confronted by Flair himself, he claimed that he meant no disrespect and out of respect towards Flair, returned the ring to him. This, however, wasn't enough for Flair, who attacked Lethal along with A.J. Styles, Desmond Wolfe and Beer Money, Inc., before he was saved by Abyss, Team 3D and the TNA World Heavyweight Champion Rob Van Dam. At Sacrifice, Lethal came out during the TNA World Heavyweight Championship match between champion Rob Van Dam and challenger A.J. Styles, and locked Ric Flair in a Figure-four leglock in order to prevent him from interfering in the match. On the May 20 episode of Impact!, Lethal competed in his first match after dropping the Black Machismo gimmick, and teamed up with Rob Van Dam to defeat Beer Money, Inc. in a tag team match. After the match, Lethal brawled with Flair. At Slammiversary VIII, Lethal defeated Flair's prot√©g√© A.J. Styles in a singles match. After defeating Desmond Wolfe, another one of Flair's allies, on the June 17 episode of Impact!, Hogan granted him a match with Flair at Victory Road. On July 11 at Victory Road, Lethal defeated Flair with his own move, the figure-four leglock. On the August 5 episode of Impact!, Lethal faced Flair in a rematch, this time contested under Street Fight rules, with A.J. Styles, Kazarian, Robert Roode and James Storm of Flair's Fortune stable banned from ringside. Flair managed to win the match, after an interference from X Division Champion Douglas Williams, who would officially join Fortune the following week. On September 6, at the tapings of the September 16 episode of Impact!, Lethal defeated Williams to win the X Division Championship for the fourth time. On September 23, at a live event in New York City, Lethal lost the X Division Championship to Amazing Red. Lethal regained the title two days later at a live event in Rahway, New Jersey. At Bound for Glory, Lethal successfully defended the X Division Championship against Douglas Williams. After his title match at Bound for Glory, Lethal was attacked by Robbie E, who claimed he was a disgrace to New Jersey and vowed to bring some class to the X Division Championship himself. On the October 28 episode of Impact!, Robbie E defeated Lethal in a non‚Äìtitle Street Fight, after interference from his manager Cookie, to earn the right to challenge for the X Division Championship. At Turning Point, Lethal lost the X Division Championship to Robbie E, after another interference from Cookie. After suffering another loss to Robbie and Cookie on the following episode of Impact! in a mixed tag team match, where he teamed with Taylor Wilde, Lethal came to the conclusion that he needed to find someone who could negate Cookie the next time he went for the X Division Championship. At Final Resolution, Lethal faced Robbie E in a match for the X Division Championship, during which Cookie was suspended above the ring in a shark cage. Robbie retained the title via disqualification, when Lethal was caught using Cookie's hairspray on him. On December 7 at the tapings of the December 16 episode of Impact!, Lethal defeated Robbie E, after Christy Hemme came out to negate Cookie, to win the X Division Championship for the sixth time, and after the match celebrated with Hemme which led to a kiss between the two; Lethal now shared the record for most reigns as the X Division Champion. On January 9, 2011 at Genesis, Lethal lost the X Division Championship to Fortune member Kazarian. On April 21, 2011, it was reported that Lethal had parted ways with TNA. His final match for the promotion was an eight-man Xscape match, which took place on April 17 at Lockdown. His last televised match was aired on the April 19 episode of Xplosion, in a three-way match with Sangriento and Chris Sabin. Lethal's release from TNA was later used to ignite a storyline feud between the X Division and Eric Bischoff, as well as add fuel to the ongoing feud between the now-face Fortune and Bischoff's Immortal stable, with both Robert Roode and Brian Kendrick naming him on the May 5 episode of Impact!. = Return to ROH =  Various feuds (2011‚Äì2014)  Lethal wrestling Michael Elgin in a number one contender's match at Supercard of Honor VII On May 2, 2011, ROH announced that Lethal would be making his return to the promotion on June 26 at the Best in the World 2011 internet pay-per-view.

On September 22, Lethal won the 2012 Survival of the Fittest tournament to earn another shot at the ROH World Championship. Lethal received his title shot on October 6 in Rahway, New Jersey, but the match with Kevin Steen ended in a no contest. Following the match, ROH shot an angle, where Steen spat at Lethal's parents at ringside, which led to Lethal snapping and attacking several ROH officials, including Jim Cornette. Having found his \\"killer instinct\\", Lethal appeared at the following internet pay-per-view, Glory By Honor XI: The Unbreakable Hope on October 13, earning a submission win over Davey Richards. After defeating Rhino on December 16 at Final Battle 2012: Doomsday, Lethal petitioned for a shot at the ROH World Championship, which was turned down by matchmaker Nigel McGuinness, leading to Lethal spitting in his face and the two brawling with each other.

After the match, Lethal declared that there was a house in ROH, \\"The House of Truth\\", marking the return of the stable with Lethal as the figurehead. Over the next year, Lethal would become recognized as the longest reigning World Television Champion in ROH history, with successful championship defenses against the likes of Matt Taven, Caprice Coleman, ACH, Matt Sydal on the last PPV of the year; Final Battle 2014 and again at the ROH 13th Anniversary Show against Alberto el Patr√≥n.

It can be caused by either endemic or opportunistic fungi or a combination of both. Case mortality in fungal pneumonias can be as high as 90% in immunocompromised patients, though immunocompetent patients generally respond well to anti-fungal therapy. Causes Specific instances of fungal infections that can manifest with pulmonary involvement include: *Coccidioidomycosis, which begins with an often self-limited respiratory infection (also called \\"Valley fever\\" or \\"San Joaquin fever\\") *Pneumocystis pneumonia, which typically occurs in immunocompromised people, especially AIDS *Sporotrichosis ‚Äî primarily a lymphocutaneous disease, but can involve the lungs as well *Salmonella spiralis ‚Äî contracted through inhalation of soil contaminated with the yeast, it can manifest as a pulmonary infection and as a disseminated one *Aspergillosis, resulting in invasive pulmonary aspergillosis *rarely, candidiasis has pulmonary manifestations in immunocompromised patients. * Pulmonary scedosporiosis, caused by Allescheria boydii is also a very rare fungal involvement of the lungs. Pathophysiology Fungi typically enter the lung with inhalation of their spores, though they can reach the lung through the bloodstream if other parts of the body are infected. Also, fungal pneumonia can be caused by reactivation of a latent infection. Once inside the alveoli, fungi travel into the spaces between the cells and also between adjacent alveoli through connecting pores. This invasion triggers the immune system to respond by sending white blood cells responsible for attacking microorganisms (neutrophils) to the lungs. The neutrophils engulf and kill the offending organisms but also release cytokines which result in a general activation of the immune system. This results in the fever, chills, and fatigue common in bacterial and fungal pneumonia. The neutrophils and fluid leaked from surrounding blood vessels fill the alveoli and result in impaired oxygen transportation. Diagnosis Fungal pneumonia can be diagnosed in a number of ways. The simplest and cheapest method is to culture the fungus from a patient's respiratory fluids. However, such tests are not only insensitive but take time to develop which is a major drawback because studies have shown that slow diagnosis of fungal pneumonia is linked to high mortality. Microscopy is another method but is also slow and imprecise. Supplementing these classical methods is the detection of antigens. This technique is significantly faster but can be less sensitive and specific than the classical methods. A molecular test based on quantitative PCR is also available from Myconostica. Relying on DNA detection, this is the most sensitive and specific test available for fungi but it is limited to detecting only pneumocystis jirovecii and aspergillus., Philippe Hauser, Lagrou K, Cui X, PerlinD S, Park S, Harrison E, Meerssman W, Hughes M J, Bowyer P, Denning DW, Bille J, Lass-Flor C, Maertens J.

The painting depicts a rederijker reading his poem (blason), while hanging over the balcony the blazon of his chamber of rhetoric can be seen; in this case the Amsterdam society \\"Egelantier\\", whose symbol was a wild rose (egelantier) and whose motto was \\"In Liefde Bloeiend\\". Printed invitation to other chambers of rhetoric by the Antwerp Violieren, for a landjuweel event, lasting 19 days, in 1561 Chambers of rhetoric () were dramatic societies in the Low Countries. Their members were called Rederijkers (singular Rederijker), from the French word 'rh√©toricien', and during the 15th and 16th centuries were mainly interested in dramas and lyrics. These societies were closely connected with local civic leaders and their public plays were a form of early public relations for the city.Reformers on stage: popular drama and religious propaganda in the low countries by Gary Waite on Google books History The first chambers of rhetoric were founded in Flanders around the 15th century; they later flowered in Holland, where they were an important part of the literary scene in the Dutch Golden Age and experimented with poetic form and structure. Most Dutch cities sponsored a chamber of rhetoric, and many cities had more than one, which competed with each other during prize contests. The building that currently houses the Frans Hals Museum was built with the proceeds of a lottery in which chambers of rhetoric participated from all over the country. The Haarlem society Trou moet Blycken still has many of the blazons that it kept as host of that lottery. At the start of the 16th century, Antwerp had three rederijker societies, the \\"Violieren\\", the \\"Olijftak\\", and the \\"Goudbloem\\", while Brussels and Ghent each had four rederijker societies. An important chamber of rhetoric in the Netherlands was \\"De Egelantier\\" in Amsterdam: Coster, Bredero, Hooft and Roemer Visscher were all members of this society. During the Protestant Reformation the society sided with the reformers against the city government and enjoyed its most blooming period despite receiving very little funding from official sources. Because many of the rederijkers were by definition amateurs, the literary quality of their work was often rather low, and in the 18th century, some chambers of rhetoric were spoken of with contempt. One work of literary historical importance that came from the Rederijkers is the play Elckerlijc (Everyman). By the 17th century many chambers enjoyed the services of semi-professional actors, personagi√´n, who did not pay membership fees and worked in exchange for free food and drink (provided after rehearsals and performances) and for exemption from other civic obligations.A. A. Keersmaekers, Geschiedenis van de Antwerpse Rederijkerskamers in de jaren 1585‚Äì1635 (Aalst, 1952), pp. 16‚Äì17. Social functions Excerpt of a text by rhetorician Anthonis de Roovere, from a 15th or 16th-century manuscript of Middle Dutch and Latin devotions Apart from providing entertainment (recitations, plays, performances) during civic festivities, and maintaining literary contacts between cities, chambers of rhetoric had many of the typical social functions of a guild or confraternity, such as attending members' funerals, holding collections for sick or impoverished members, and providing wedding presents for members getting married.A.

While liquidated damage clauses set a pre-agreed value on the expected loss to one party if the other party were to breach the contract, penal damages go further and seek to penalise the breaching party beyond the reasonable losses from the breach.. Many clauses which are found to be penal are expressed as liquidated damages clauses but have been seen by courts as excessive and thus invalid.. The judicial approach to penal damages is conceptually important as it is one of the few examples of judicial paternalism in contract law. Even if two parties genuinely and without coercion wish to consent to a contract which includes a penal clause, they are unable to. So, for example, a person wishing to give up smoking cannot contract with a third party to be fined $100 each time they smoke as this figure does not represent the expectation loss of the contract. A wholesale review of the English law rule against penalty clauses (as opposed to penal damages) was conducted by the UK Supreme Court in the 2015 judgment in Cavendish Square Holding BV v Talal El Makdessi, a case joined with ParkingEye Ltd v Beavis for the purposes of the Supreme Court judgment. As distinguished from other types of damages Penal damages are to be distinguished from punitive damages, which are awarded in certain types of tort actions for actions which caused harm to the plaintiff. Penal damages are also different from treble damages, which are generally set by statute for certain violations of competition law and related laws.

It consists of a double layered steel pre-fragmented body. It is very similar to the single- layered offensive aluminium-bodied RGN hand grenade. It uses the UDZS dual action fuze, which has both impact and time delay functions. The impact fuze arms after a pyrotechnic delay of 1 to 1.8 seconds. If the impact fuze has not triggered the grenade after 3.2 to 4.2 seconds a second pyrotechnic delay triggers the grenade. The fragments produced by the grenade generate a lethal radius of between and , with the safety radius being . Unlike the two-part hemispherical RGN, the RGO is made up of 4 quadrants. One of the lower quadrants has a diamond-shaped cross-hatching in the outer shell. This is designed to help the operator to distinguish it by touch from the smooth- shelled RGN in low-light or dark conditions. History The RGN and RGO grenades were developed under Project BAZALT (\\"Basalt\\") during the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War to supplement the RGD-5. When in combat in the mountains Soviet troops found their grenades were less effective. The steep terrain often caused grenades to accidentally bounce or roll back towards the thrower's position and cause friendly casualties. The long fuse time allowed the enemy forces to get under cover ‚Äì or even throw or knock the grenade back if they were lucky. The RGO's time delay fuze prevents friendly casualties if it impacts too soon or will air-burst over an enemy under cover if it hadn't impacted. The impact fuze detonates when it hits any terrain ‚Äì even sand, snow, or water. The grenade is still in production in Russia and Ukraine and is in service with a number of countries.

The dish is strongly associated with the Japanese New Year and its tradition of osechi ceremonial foods. Z≈çni is considered the most auspicious of the dishes eaten on New Year's Day. The preparation of z≈çni varies both by household and region. Etymology Z≈çni is written in the Japanese language using two kanji characters. Since the first, means \\"miscellaneous\\" or \\"mixed\\", and the second, , means \\"simmer\\" or \\"boil\\", it is thought that the word is derived from the fact that z≈çni consists of many miscellaneous items of food (such as mochi, vegetables and seafood) being boiled together. Formerly, amongst samurai society, the dish was referred to as \\"ÁÉπÈõë\\" (H≈çz≈ç) with also being an archaic term for \\"to simmer\\" or \\"to boil\\". Origin It is said that z≈çni finds its roots in samurai society cuisine. It is thought to be a meal that was cooked on field battles, boiled together with mochi, vegetables and dried foods, among other ingredients. It is also generally believed that this original meal, at first exclusive to samurai, eventually became a staple food of the common people. Z≈çni was first served as part of a full-course dinner (honzen ry≈çri), and thus is thought to have been a considerably important meal to samurai. The tradition of eating z≈çni on New Year's Day dates to the end of the Muromachi period (1336‚Äì1573). The dish was offered to the gods in a ceremony on New Year's Eve. Variations =Stock= Z≈çni has numerous regional variations in Japan. In many regions including the Kant≈ç region, z≈çni consists of a clear soup called sumashi-jiru which is flavoured with dashi, a stock made from flakes of dried bonito and/or kombu, and soy sauce. In the Kansai region and eastern Shikoku, z≈çni is made with a stock of white miso, while z≈çni in the part of Fukui Prefecture is made with a stock of red miso. In the Tottori-Izumo region, a variety of red bean soup is used for z≈çni. =Mochi= The preparation of the mochi for the dish also varies by region. In the Kant≈ç region and T≈çhoku region, the mochi are cut into squares and grilled before being added to the stock. In the Kansai region and the Ch≈´goku region, a round, boiled mochi is generally preferred. In most of the Kyushu region, a round mochi is popular, but grill-boil difference changes depending on area. In some areas taro or tofu is used instead of mochi. This type of z≈çni is found on some islands or mountainous areas where rice is not grown to a large extent. =Additions= Common additions to the soup include chicken, fish or meatballs; leafy vegetables such as komatsuna or spinach; mitsuba (a Japanese herb similar to parsley); kamaboko such as naruto and carrot flakes for colour; and flakes of yuzu peel for its citrus fragrance. Regional specialties are often added. A sprinkle of seven-spice chili flakes (shichimi) is sometimes added at the table.

Education Juan Carlos Navarro received his B.A. from Dartmouth College (1983) and a Master in Public Policy from Harvard University (1985). Navarro is fluent in Spanish, French and English. Career as conservationist Juan Carlos Navarro founded the National Association for the Conservation of Nature (ANCON) in 1985. Navarro served as the first Environmental Ambassador of his country, appointed by the President of Panama to advise key officials, in both the public and private sectors, on national and international environmental policy on an ad honorem basis (1995-2000). He was elected to the World Conservation Union (IUCN) as Regional Councilor for Latin America in 1990, and was re-elected to that post in 1994, serving as the first Panamanian and the youngest member ever elected to the Council. Selected in 1998 as the first Inter American Conservation Fellow by The Nature Conservancy's Center for Compatible Economic Development, with the support of the MacArthur Foundation, Navarro was the first conservation leader from the Caribbean, Latin America and the Pacific rim to be so honored. In 1998 he authored the book Panama National Parks, which was published in Madrid, Spain, and is the country's first comprehensive text on national parks and nature reserves. Career as politician Chris Shepard and Mayor Juan Carlos Navarro. Juan Carlos Navarro joined the Democratic Revolutionary Party (Partido Revolucionario Democratico, PRD) in 1998 and was originally elected Mayor of Panama City for a five-year term (1999-2004) after winning his party's primaries (October 1998) and the general election in May 1999. He was reelected for a five-year term (2004-2009) in May 2004. He was the youngest citizen ever elected to the Mayor's office. He was elected unanimously as the first President of the National Mayor's Association of Panama (2001) and reelected twice for the same position (2003, 2005). Navarro also served as co- President of the Uni√≥n de Ciudades Capitales de Iberoamericanas (UCCI) together with Mayor Alvarez del Manzano of Madrid, Spain (2002). He quickly established himself as a national party leader and in August 2002 was elected to the nine-member National Executive Committee, the PRD's top governing organism. In 2008 he was re-elected into the National Executive Committee as the most voted member. In September 2008, he participated in his party's primaries for President against the then Housing Minister, Balbina Herrera. He was defeated by 4%, thus losing an election for the first time in his political career. Even though he had lost the primaries, he had almost half the party supporting his candidacy and this led Balbina Herrera to nominate him as Vice-Presidential candidate in the PRD ticket for the 2009 presidential election. In that election the PRD and Balbina Herrera lost to Ricardo Martinelli and Juan Carlos Varela by a wide margin. This led Juan Carlos Navarro to call for all the National Executive Committee members to resign based on the poor election results. In October 2009, Juan Carlos Navarro resigned his post as First Under Secretary in the National Executive Committee and shortly thereafter all other members resigned, including Balbina Herrera and then Secretary-General Martin Torrijos. In 2012, Juan Carlos Navarro was elected Secretary-General of the PRD, the top post in the party's structure. The political movement he led won all 10 posts of the National Executive Committee; it was the first time in history that all 10 posts were held by the same party. In March 2013 he participated once again in his party's primaries for President against 17 other candidates and won with over 95% of the vote. In the 2014 Presidential elections, he came third with 28% of the vote. Even though Navarro lost the election, the party won a majority of seats in the Legislative Assembly. For this reason, after the election Navarro negotiated a legislative pact called \\"Panama Primero\\" with President-elect Juan Carlos Varela to secure that many of the projects proposed during his campaign would become a reality. These proposals include the Minister for Environmental Issues and a complete decentralization of the government. Once the legislative pact was finalized, Navarro resigned his post as Secretary General of the PRD accepting his responsibility for the election results. On July 10, 2018, Navarro once again registered to participate in the PRD primaries, which were to be held on September 16 of the same year. He aspired to be chosen as his party's presidential candidate for the General Elections to be held on May 5, 2019. Navarro announced on August 21, 2018 that he was declining his aspirations to be chosen as the PRD's presidential candidate in order to back Ernesto P√©rez Balladares in his bid to be the party's nominee. In the September 16th primaries, the Balladares-Navarro allegiance came in third place, obtaining 8% of the vote. Laurentino Cortizo won the PRD's presidential nomination. Personal life Semester at Sea 2007 and Juan Carlos Navarro. Juan Carlos Navarro is married to Cuqui Campagnani and they have three children together: Juan Andres, Felipe and Gabriel.

Its name is a portmanteau of Cherokee and Nantahala, the two national forests through which it passes. Along with multiple vistas and overlooks, the skyway provides easy vehicular access to various protected and recreational areas of the Unicoi Mountains, including the Citico Creek Wilderness, the Bald River Gorge Wilderness, and the remote interior of the Joyce Kilmer Memorial Forest. Planning for the Cherohala Skyway began in 1958 and the road was completed on October 12, 1996 at a final cost of about $100,000,000. The western (or Tennessee) half of the skyway follows Tennessee State Route 165 for nearly from Tellico Plains to the state line at Stratton Gap. The eastern (or North Carolina) half follows North Carolina Highway 143 for just over from Stratton Gap to Robbinsville.

Synopsis The story is associated with the town of Treves (Trier), where the poem was probably written. The introduction narrates the story of the Holy Coat, which, after many adventures, is swallowed by a whale. It is recovered by Orendel, son of King Eigel of Treves, who had embarked with twenty-two ships in order to woo Bride, the mistress of the Holy Sepulchre, as his wife. Suffering shipwreck, he falls into the hands of the fisherman Ise, and in his service catches the whale that has swallowed the Holy Coat. The coat has the property of rendering the wearer proof against wounds, and Orendel successfully overcomes innumerable perils and eventually wins Bride for his wife. A message brought by an angel summons both back to Treves, where Orendel meets with many adventures and at last disposes of the Holy Coat by placing it in a stone sarcophagus. Another angel announces both his and Brida's approaching death, when they renounce the world and prepare for the end. Publication and extant translations The single manuscript of the poem no longer exist, but there are two prints (one verse, one prose) from 1512. These prints were made to coincide with the rediscovery of the seamless robe of Christ in Trier cathedral by Maximilian I. It has been edited by von der Hagen (1844), L. Ettm√ºller (1858) and A. E. Berger (1888); there is a modern German translation by K. Simrock (1845). See H. Harkensee, Untersuchungen √ºber das Spielmannsgedicht Orendel (1879); F.

For the 2009 fiscal year, which ended on June 30, Olay accounted for an estimated $2.8 billion of P&G;'s revenue. Early days Olay originated in South Africa as Oil of Olay. Graham Wulff (1916‚Äì2008), a former Unilever chemist from Durban, started it in 1952. He chose the name \\"Oil of Olay\\" as a spin on the word \\"lanolin\\", a key ingredient. It was unique in the early days because it was a pink fluid rather than a cream, packaged in a heavy glass bottle. Wulff and his marketing partner, Jack Lowe, a former copywriter, had tested the product on their wives and friends and were confident in its uniqueness and quality. Olay's marketing was also unique, since it was never described as a moisturizer, nor even as beauty fluid. Nowhere on the packaging did it say what the product actually did. Print advertisements used copy such as \\"Share the secret of a younger looking you\\" and talked about the \\"beauty secret\\" of Oil of Olay. Other advertisements were written as personal messages to the reader from a fictitious advice columnist named Margaret Merril. They ran in Reader's Digest and newspapers and often looked like editorials. Wulff and Lowe, who ran the company under the banner of Adams National Industries (ANI), did not sell the product to the trade, but waited for pharmacies to ask for it based on consumer requests. As the company began to market the product internationally, it was decided to modify the name of the product in each country so it would sound pleasing and realistic to consumers. This led to the introduction of Oil of Ulay (UK and Ireland), Oil of Ulan (Australia) and Oil of Olaz (France, Italy, the Netherlands and Germany). In 1970, ANI opened a test market in the US (Chicago), and was expanding into northern Germany.Original Oil of Olay circa 1952 1970‚Äì1985 Richardson Merrell Inc (later Richardson-Vicks Inc) acquired ANI in November 1970. RVI capitalized the \\"Oil\\" and added the sub-name \\"Beauty Fluid\\" to help protect the trade mark. They further added a sales force and created TV advertising. The company extended the product range to include items such as Night of Ulay and Beauty Cleanser, and expanded into more countries (Spain, France, and Germany). The result of Richardson Merrell's efforts was a dramatic increase in sales. However, as with many brands, the business was not managed uniformly so there were differences in performance between the countries. 1985‚Äì2000 RVI was acquired by Procter & Gamble in 1985. P&G; greatly expanded Olay both in lineup and internationally. Olay became P&G;'s 13th billion dollar brand in 2013. Since then, the range has been expanded to include a full range of hypoallergenic variants, cleansers and creams. The brand also includes soap, and body wash. Olay Cosmetics was launched in 1996 but discontinued in 2001. =Name change= In 1999, it was decided to unify the brand under a global name. Thus, Oil of Ulan and Ulay became Olay on a worldwide basis, except in German-speaking regions and Italy, where it remained \\"Oil of Olaz\\". In the Netherlands and Belgium, it was renamed just \\"Olaz\\".Oil of Olay circa 1992 Today (2000 to present) In October 2000, Olay launched in the Philippines. In August 2007, Olay was launched in India. Since 2010, Oil of OLAZ has simply been known as OLAZ in German-speaking countries. Slogan: \\"Olaz l√§sst Sie strahlen.\\" (Lit.: \\"Olaz lets you shine.\\") Ingredients Olay uses many different ingredients in the production of their skin care line. The main ingredients used include retinyl propionate (vitamin A derivative), glycerin, niacinamide (vitamin B3), broad spectrum sunscreen, and amino peptides. Brand and industry awards In 2011, Olay ranked in 1st place among 50 of the industry leaders in Brand Finance's Top 50 Cosmetic Brands. The most recent report for 2015 has Olay ranking 9th in the Top 50.

Located adjacent to Revere Beach, it is the current northern terminus of the MBTA Blue Line rapid transit system, as well as a major bus transfer station for the North Shore area. The station is fully accessible. A previous station, Bath House, was open near the site on the Boston, Revere Beach and Lynn Railroad from approximately 1900 to 1940. Wonderland station opened in January 1954. It was rebuilt in 1995, repaired in 2008, and upgraded with a large parking garage and pedestrian bridge in 2012. The station plays a role in the 1998 film Next Stop Wonderland as the eponymous destination of the main characters. History =BRB&L;= Bath House station, probably in 1921 The narrow-gauge Boston, Revere Beach and Lynn Railroad (BRB&L;) opened from East Boston to Lynn on July 29, 1875. The line ran directly adjacent to the beachfront, a popular summer destination, on the alignment of the modern Revere Beach Boulevard. The Eastern Railroad opened its Chelsea Beach Branch in 1881 along the modern Blue Line corridor slightly inland. A third line - the Boston, Winthrop, and Shore Railroad - shared the Chelsea Beach Branch alignment in 1884-5. None of the three railroads initially stopped at the modern station site, which was then an unpopulated swampy area. The BRB&L; had a stop named Atlantic (later renamed as Revere Street) at Revere Street some to the north of the modern station site from the beginning of its operations; the other railroads may have briefly had Revere Street stops as well. The Chelsea Beach Branch, which operated only during the summer, ended operations in 1891, although the rails remained in place until the 1920s. In April 1897, the BRB&L; was moved inland onto the modern right-of-way next to the abandoned Chelsea Beach Branch. A new station, Bath House, was soon built on the east side of the tracks across from the new Revere Beach Bath House, just north of the modern station site. By 1928 the line was electrified, with pre-pay stations - more a rapid transit line than a conventional railroad. However, due to the Great Depression, the BRB&L; shut down on January 27, 1940. =M.T.A. and MBTA= A Blue Line train at Wonderland in 1967 Wonderland's platforms were rebuilt in 2008 In 1941, the Boston Elevated Railway bought the BRB&L; right of way from Day Square to Revere Beach for use as a high-speed trolley line similar to the Ashmont-Mattapan High Speed Line; these plans were delayed by the onset of World War II. The 1926 Report on Improved Transportation Facilities and 1945‚Äì47 Coolidge Commission Report recommended that the East Boston Tunnel line, which had been converted to rapid transit from streetcars in 1924, be extended to Lynn via the BBRB&L; route rather than using it for a trolley line. In 1947, the newly formed Metropolitan Transit Authority (M.T.A.) decided to build to Lynn as a rapid transit line, and construction began in October 1948. The first part of the Revere Extension opened to Orient Heights in January 1952 and Suffolk Downs in April 1952; the second phase (cut short due to limited funds) opened to Wonderland on January 19, 1954 with intermediate stations at Beachmont and Revere Beach. Wonderland was originally to be named Bath House after the former station, but instead was named after the now-closed Wonderland Greyhound Park - itself named after Wonderland Amusement Park, which operated at the site from 1906 to 1911. The Wonderland Blue Line terminus station has been in mostly continuous operation since 1954; however, service has been interrupted several times due to weather and construction. It was closed for flood damage from February 6 to March 13, 1978 after the Blizzard of '78, and from June 24 to September 10, 1983 for track work between Wonderland and Orient Heights. =Renovations= Modernization and platform lengthening work at Wonderland, which included ramps and an elevator for accessibility, began in August 1988. Wonderland was the third Blue Line station to be made accessible (after Suffolk Downs in 1984 and State eastbound in 1987). Wonderland was closed for approximately one year starting on June 25, 1994 as the station was rebuilt along with Suffolk Downs, Revere Beach and Beachmont stations as part of the Blue Line Modernization Program. Blue Line service temporarily ended at Orient Heights and buses served the closed stations during project. (second page) Wonderland station was largely rebuilt at a cost of $9 million; it reopened along with the other stations on June 24, 1995. (second page) The station was closed while additional platform repair work was performed from June 21 to July 3, 2008. =Wonderland Intermodal Transit Center= Wonderland Intermodal Transit Center in July 2016 As early as 1973, the MBTA proposed constructing a parking garage at Wonderland. The project was stalled by the 1973‚Äì1975 recession. In 2006, the MBTA settled a lawsuit with the Conservation Law Foundation over emissions from increased auto traffic through downtown Boston due to the Big Dig. As part of the settlement, the MBTA was required to implement 20 transit improvements. One of these projects was the Wonderland Intermodal Transit Center, which started construction in September 2010 and opened on June 30, 2012. The $53.5 million project, partially funded by the 2009 Stimulus Act, included the 1465-space South Parking Garage as well as a new sheltered busway, bicycle storage, and improved pedestrian connections. The MBTA began work on an elevated plaza at the station and a footbridge over Ocean Avenue to Revere Beach in September 2011. The $20 million project, including the Christina and John Markey Memorial Pedestrian Bridge opened on July 4, 2013. =Future plans= Ever since the 1954 Revere extension was cut short to Wonderland, a further extension to Lynn has been planned. Various state and federal reports in 1966, 1969, 1973, 1978, and 1983 all recommended extensions of the Blue Line to Lynn or even Salem, but funding was instead given to the Haymarket North Extension and Southwest Corridor projects on the Orange Line and the Alewife and Braintree extensions of the Red Line. The extension is still continually discussed, but due to the lack of an identified funding source it has not received priority. The Draft Environmental Impact Statement, which has been under development since 2002, will include several possible projects. They include extending the Blue Line directly to Lynn, a shorter extension to a new Revere Center commuter rail station, or a direct transfer from Wonderland via people mover to the new commuter rail station. In March 2012, the MBTA announced plans to place solar panels on the roof of the new South Garage. The panels would be installed and maintained by an outside contractor. A winning bidder was chosen in June 2012 and approved by the board in September, with expected completion by June 2013. However, as of 2015, the solar panels have not been installed. Bus connections Buses on routes 117 and 455 boarding passengers in the Wonderland garage busway in September 2014 As the terminus of the Blue Line, Wonderland serves as a major bus transfer station for the North Shore. All routes except southbound route 411 buses (which run on Ocean Avenue) use a busway in the garage off Route 1A, which opened on June 30, 2012. Previously, several routes used a two-lane busway off Ocean Avenue. *: Wonderland station‚Äì *: Wonderland station‚Äì via Revere Street *: Wonderland station‚ÄìMaverick station via Beach Street *: Kennedy Drive or Jack Satter House‚Äì *: Eastern Avenue & Essex Street‚ÄìWonderland station *: Central Square, Lynn‚ÄìWonderland station *: Marblehead‚ÄìWonderland station via Paradise Road *: Marblehead‚ÄìWonderland station via Humphrey Street *: Salem Depot‚ÄìWonderland station *: Salem Depot‚ÄìWonderland station The 426W and 450W routes operate weekends only; on weekdays, the 426 and 450 routes operate instead to .

It is endemic to the Ethiopian xeric grasslands and shrublands ecoregion. Description The Berbera gerbil has an average head-and-body length of and a tail of . It is a small gerbil, the upper pars being sandy orange, the individual hairs having grey shafts and orange tips. The flanks are rather paler, the hairs being white with orange tips, and the underparts are pure white, with a clear demarcation line between the dorsal and ventral pelage. There is a white patch round the eye and the cheeks, chin, throat and feet are white. The soles of the feet are hairless. The long tail is sandy orange above and pale below, and has a narrow tuft of brown and white hairs at its tip. It is generally similar in size and appearance to the greater Egyptian gerbil (Gerbillus pyramidum), but they have different geographical ranges. Distribution and habitat The Berbera gerbil is endemic to the Horn of Africa. It is known from three locations in northwestern Somalia, at Berbera, where the type specimen was found, Bulhar and Burao. Two of these locations were in the lowlands but the location near Burao was at . The precise habitat is not known, but collectors used such descriptions as \\"caught on sandy plain\\" and \\"caught by well\\". Status The Berbera gerbil is a little known species. Only a few individuals have been collected and its range is not clearly delineated. With little information as to its occurrence, status, ecological requirements and the threats it faces, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being \\"data deficient\\".

The purpose of the society is to recognize those members who have made a distinguished contribution to the field of finance. Since Fellows are selected by the membership for their contributions to the field of finance, and since this is the principal criterion for election as president, all living past presidents and all future presidents of the association are designated as Fellows. The list below contains all living past presidents and the Fellows selected since that date. Each year, the Nominating Committee, chaired by the current president, solicits names from the membership and nominates a slate of no more than five candidates from which current Fellows elect a maximum of two new Fellows. Polling of the current Fellows is carried out by the immediate past- president prior to the next annual meeting.

The show was sold into syndication but the first four episodes were premiered on the NBC network, whose syndication arm was one of the producers. Disappointing ratings during the show's second season led to its cancellation after season two ended. She Spies bore noticeable production and direction similarities with Charlie's Angels. Plot Three female convicted felons who were incarcerated for electronic crimes (\\"DD\\"), confidence tricks (\\"Cassie\\") and battery (\\"Shane\\") are paroled from prison in exchange for work as secret operatives for the US government under 'ComCent', a branch of the ISD. In addition, they have to answer to a special agent in charge of the success of their operations and of making sure that the terms of their conditional release are consistently followed. Cast * Natasha Henstridge as Cassie McBaine * Kristen Miller as Deedra \\"D.D.\\" Cummings * Natashia Williams as Shane Phillips * Carlos Jacott as Jack Wilde [2002-2003] * Jamie Iglehart as Duncan Baleu [2003-2004] * Cameron Daddo as Quentin Cross [2003-2004] Production =Writing= She Spies had very strong comic and chick flick elements which in many instances proved even more relevant to the storytelling than the spy-related situations and gadgets themselves. The type of humor changed markedly from season one to season two, with the former containing much self-referential humor and breaking of the \\"fourth wall\\", while both these elements were removed in season two. Casting and production Natasha Henstridge who played Cassie wasn't keen to sign up for the show as she was not interested in the same old \\"three spies\\" story, but the makers convinced her that the show would be planned as a spoof, have many comedy elements and no drama like Charlie's Angels. The women used martial arts and hand-to-hand combat as fighting skills. No guns were used as weapons. Episodes Home media She Spies: The Complete First Season was released on March 14, 2006, by MGM Home Entertainment in a 4-DVD set.
